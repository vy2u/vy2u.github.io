today's video is going to be on this fun
festive makeup look I really wanted to
do something a little bit different a
little bit creative and I was super
inspired by vibe raquel she is like a
phenomenal artist on instagram i'll link
her in the description box if you don't
follow her already you have to follow
her your you'll love everything she
posed she's really cute and her makeup
is amazing she did this really cool
green makeup look here look at that
oh yeah yes okay she also does these
cool festival looks she has one here and
it looks like she's crying
glitter so I wanted to also incorporate
the crying glitter type feel I think
this look will be great for festivals
for the festival season if you want to
do something really different I also
think it would be good for st. Patrick's
Day which total accident but as I was
doing it I was like wow you definitely
wouldn't get pinched if you wore this on
st. Patrick's Day yeah a lot of fun
creating it so if you guys are
interested then people I'm gonna quit
well I hope I can speak fluent Spanish
first I'm going to prep my lid and I'm
going to use Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
for this just when I do more colorful
looks I feel like this really cancels
out any color on my lid and just kind of
make everything look more vibrant so I'm
using a sigma precision round brush for
this really like these kind of buffing
brushes to apply it because it gives a
nice even layer across the lead next I'm
picking up a bone colored eye shadow or
you could use translucent powder and I'm
just setting the eyeshadow base you guys
already know I always do this I'm going
to use scotch tape give myself a sharp
line I usually don't do this but let's
try it out when I tried this before I
got the angle slightly wrong maybe I can
take like a light brown shadow and just
kind of see where I would be normally
put it I think like there collects good
forgot that you actually want to put it
on your hand and like make it less
sticky because what to sticky it kind of
hurts
who you can pass at an angle guys you
know what we'll see we shall see
going into the modern Renaissance
palette I'm going to be picking up burnt
orange which is the shade right here
it's just kind of a really warm tone
brown with orange undertones and I'm
using a Smith 247 brush so I'm first
just going to kind of tilt my head back
and create the kind of cut creates type
shape that we're going to be going for
the tape is nice because it keeps it
from getting really messy just taking it
all the way in and all the way out into
that tape I really hope this tape method
doesn't backfire on me a few moments
later actually this how to take the tape
off because when I was checking to see
how it was going it wasn't going well so
I had to reapply my base so here we are
again but I'm taking the burnt orange
shade again and is lightly creating a
shape you don't really want this color
so much to show through just kind of so
we get our shape going here very lightly
yeah let's just throw down this color
real quick give us a nice little
guideline that's pretty good it's enough
of a guideline I'm going to do the same
thing to the other eye all right so I'm
picking up the Fuji and this is a makeup
geek eyeshadow it's just like a nice
lime green color I think I'm going to
pick that up with the morphe morphe
brush that has no no name so we're going
to take a little bit of that and start
blending this into the inner crease like
wondering if I have a green with a
little bit more graphic let's actually
chase xenon by melt cosmetics take that
these neon ones do you have a little
more fallout so you have to be a little
bit more careful but I think it might
give us a better color payoff right now
I'm going to pick that up back on 84 7
and I'm just going to wiggle that into
the inner part of the crease shade that
we created
I'm going to keep rounding that shape
out and
building up the intensity here picking
up that little morphe brush again I'm
going to focus the color a little bit
more for the crease cut out looks you
kind of deep and everything else I'm
going to take enchanted forest and this
is a makeup geek shadow so the nice
forest green I use the same brush the
t47 by Smith and I'm going to start kind
of here in the center just lightly start
bringing it into that inner corner and
out to the outer corner this is going to
start grounding to look because with
just a yellow the green we kind of look
sick and I like to start in the middle
because I like the product to be the
most pigmented right there because if
you start at the end where you want the
product to fade out more it's going to
be a little too harsh kind of harder to
blend out as well so once I start having
less product on my brush that's when I
start to feather it outwards so I am
currently growing out my brows like in
this area so if you see sparse hairs
because I'm growing it out trying not to
fluff them just to see what happens see
what kind of shape we can get it's
really hard for me to fill them in right
now because I'm not used to it I've
never like had the power to really grow
out my brows and not like tweeze certain
parts of em so we'll see we'll see what
happens what kind of shape I can get
mostly on the tail that I'm growing out
the hairs I like to go back in with this
little morphe brush and a tiny bit of
product and then just really guide the
crease in the right direction so when
you use a smaller pencil brush it's just
going to give you a little bit more
color payoff where you want it to be so
since I'm trying to kind of cut the
crease right now I'm getting like poison
ivy vibes just hoping for the best here
I'm picking the Xenon shade back up and
I'm just going to go over the fourth
screen that we just sit down and kind of
blur out the edges initially I wasn't
going to put this color all the way
across but I like the way it blends with
the fourth green so taking all the way
into the center and then whatever
let me suss out the edge I'm taking that
forest green color I'm going to connect
the separation we have here kind of
blend it inwards some good ideas to
shape that we're going to start having
like a rough connect can also make it
perfect yet because we're still going to
be applying other eye shadows but I just
kind of want to have the connect layer
so I know what's going
I'm going to go into a dark brown this
is called Cypress umber we're going to
take that and I'm actually going to
continue to use this morphe brush and
this is actually going to go on the
outer part of the crease and it's going
to be the lowest the lowest shade into
the crease so that we have the brown the
fourth screen and then that xenon color
actually think we need a fluffier brush
for this all right I was going to use
that brown but I think I'm going to
carve out the lip space a little bit
before I decide to deepen it up so I'm
using an eyeshadow base to wreak r'v
the cut crease make sure it looks nice
and clean if you have any mess-ups it'll
clean them up for you I'm using a flat
concealer brush that always works the
best sorry I'm so close to my mirror my
eyes are just so dry like I'm very
squinty right now so I'm just really
close inside my mirror duplo's too much
activity for my crease and then actually
like this high up I'm taking it a little
higher than normal all right so do you
guys see what a difference carving out
the lid does for your life like it
really just made the crease look sharp
AF next we're gonna go to this ganache
of Danone it the nitrogen onna this acid
in Madinah palette has two sides it's
beautiful this is like some more blue
and the warmth inside actually no the
side warm tone students is green and
warm tone so we're going to hop into the
green side and I'm going to be using
this shade for all over the lid right
here it's really pretty it's called and
he always you guys can purchase these
individually as well if you want to
purchase like this massive palette but
antique olive is really pretty picking
that up on the same brush that I used to
carve the crease I'm going to put this
on all over
I'm going to bring my brush with fixed
left I just put this on my bare ass
later earlier and it was super shiny I
think just because I have so much
eyeshadow base and like I am you know
when we first started I packed on powder
over it so I think it's just like a
little bit drier now that eyeshadow base
area when I applied this earlier it was
fire with nothing underneath
I'm going to blend it into this outer
corner I'm actually going to take some
of this shade which is too gold right
here and I'm going to pop that in the
center actually I'm first going to pop
it into the inner corner and see what it
looks like the pencil brush super pretty
don't want to put too much of this on
yet because I don't have foundation or
concealer so it might take away from
some of that but let's see what it looks
like in center I don't know why I'm
developing an accent out of nowhere
wait all right we've got a baffle some
of that in the center because it is very
glittery this gold eyeshadow and it's
just going to lightly capture the light
in the center of the lid okay if you get
fallout because we can just clean that
up later I had to fix the lighting for
my backdrop it was clashing with what I
had going on so we just just made a
quick change okay so I think I am going
to deepen up the crease a little bit in
the outer corner I'm going to go into
Cyprus number right here I'm going to
take a Mac 263 and the dark brown eye
shadow I just want to make sure I have a
very good placement and I don't want it
to get too messy so I'm lightly
outlining the very bottom of the crease
here with this brush and then you can
blend it out with a fluffier brush I
just want to get the color right where I
need it to be it wasn't intending on
this being a st. Patrick's Day look but
so I'm not taking this all the way in
just about half way and then a little
more than halfway actually like right
when you start to get round on your
crease then I'm stopping with that dark
brown eye shadow I'm also going to take
the liner brush and start smoking out
the lash line just a bit here and
connecting this over here
softly blending it all out
so you kind of make a harsh line and
then push the product inwards I'm just
going with this angled brush which I
don't usually do but it's working for me
right now so here we are for my
foundation I'm going to be mixing the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk with the
bare minerals bare skin sheer Sun this
is just a bronzing serum that you could
mix with your foundation or just kind of
where it bronzer I want to look extra
thin so I'm going to mix that in with my
foundation this is in the shade number
seven I'm going to take a few drops of
this I'm in my little laboratory right
now you can kind of control the drops
like how 10 do you want to be how
bronzed do you want to be in to mix it
all together so I'm just using the brush
that I mix my foundation with to apply
it this isn't really the best option but
since I've already gotten it all
Foundation let's do it so that bare
mineral stuff just gives you such a nice
bronze glow I love it I just started
using it actually the other day and I
really liked it going to start on this
outer part of my face down the mitt
obviously if your bronzing yourself up a
lot you have to take it down your neck
and your chest I'm just going to kind of
take it down to where you guys can see
once again I'm filming late at night I
hate when I do this to myself because
right after I'm done I just know I'm
going to take all of this off can I hate
that because I wish I could get more use
out of it I mean I would go to the
grocery store with this look I just wish
I had more time with it by the time I'm
done I'm going to be so tired and just
take it right off I already know think
about filming creative looks is you feel
creative when you feel creative and
sometimes you just aren't ready for it
yet so unfortunately for me I'm more
creative at night so I start filming
late at night sometimes I wish always
like more of a morning brain person I'm
just not so I have barely any of this
concealer left this is the Becca alpha
luminous concealer in medium just going
to apply that under my eyes because I'm
really dry right now so we just went
snowboarding with Wendy and she's a
co-founder of
urban decay and so my skin is like
really dry so I'm just trying to use a
more hydrating concealer I barely have
any left I'm really scraping at the
edges here I keep forgetting like every
single time I head out the door I'm like
go to Sephora getting a concealer and
eye cream
okay now I'm going to take the shape
tape and this is really good for
slimming down the nose by highlighting
it so I just put a straight line trick
it you want it to be straight when you
apply it because once it sets a little
bit it's going to stay with that
straight shape if you make it crooked
then it's going to look wicked not my
best but it'll do it's going to kind of
blend out the edges up top here so I
don't need that to be a blunt concealer
line I'm going to pick up this la girl
concealer in coats kind of just pop on
the back of my hands with that I'm going
to contour the sides of my nose
I don't have to do this if you're not
you know if you don't need to just love
being extra with my nose contour and
then take your V blender and just blend
it out go straight down the nose first
to get the concealer pre blended and
then just soften up the sides I'll just
turn the beauty blender over on the
pointy part more like the pointy edge
and just go along those edges lightly
passing lots of pouncing spend half my
day pouncing next I'm taking the Laura
Mercier translucent powder and making
sure to set the sides of the nose where
I get most oily and the under eyes so
now that we done director Taylor will go
back into the forest color and start
really smoking out the lower lash line
so I'm just taking the pencil brush
again darkest green at the outer corner
you just want to find the connection
between the top and bring it down and I
have my semi clean blending brush right
here just so I could really feather out
those edges just in case the green goes
a little too low which happens a lot
with me and I'm going to go back into
the same dark brown shade that we used
earlier with the angled Mac brush and
I'm going to apply that right under the
waterline right before the green look
down and just press so you get less
fallout it's also better for your under
eye area just a light little press we're
going to go back into the green color
all of the green they'll be used on the
lid I'm going to take that and apply it
right here
on the lower lash line and connect from
the dark shade into the inner corner
then again I'm just
patting that color
actually going to dip into the xenon
color that lime green and just run it
right under all those colors that we
just put the blending brush it's about
to get kind of crazy down here once we
add all the glitter and so taking a
clean brush and just cleaning up that
edge over here could be like a poison
ivy Halloween makeup lip as well I feel
like that would be pretty cool st.
Patrick's Day it poison ivy I'm speaking
up this Marc Jacobs this is one of their
new gel liners and this is just in one
of the brown shades trying to find a
name here Brown called brown brown out
so I'm just going to run this in the
waterline so now we're new like mascara
I'm using the Maybelline Colossus
bigshots system for applying falsies you
don't need a lot of mascara just a nice
a nice layer to coat them okay so now
it's time for lashes I'm using House of
lashes ikonics these are just a normal
ikonics
she's going to come from above then Park
them and then just kind of go into the
outer and inner corner and really like
tuck it in so before we start all the
like fun stuff well everything's fun but
before we start to glitter and
everything I'm going to finish the face
makeup I'm gonna go into the gilded
honey highlight by Laura Geller and I'm
using the 306 this is the Linda Hallberg
brush yeah we want to just being soft
this brush is really soft I'm also going
to put that along the top of the brow
right here when I use the golden honey
spill and go down the bridge of my nose
with that and on the tip of the nose
keep it so want to make sure afterwards
to blend all the edges of the highlight
going in with the girl on bronzer and oh
five and I'm going to use the 310 Linda
Hallberg brush what my cheekbones to be
pretty pretty sharp a nice light bronze
but I'm going to take them up pretty
high right here
and just kind of hug the highlights take
it up really sharp and then into the
hairline jewel so now we're going to do
the glitter part I have like a bunch of
glitter here I have some craft chunky
glitter
I have some eyes Letta that's a little
bit more finely narrowed I have this
Urban Decay Midnight Cowboy glitter and
then I also have little tiny glitter
stars so I'm going to apply these with
lash glue the duo lash glue what do you
want to do is make sure that you take a
little bit of lash glue out and put it
on a tray and let it dry until it's
tacky so it's not super slippery it's
been setting for a while I put it on one
star and I'm just going to put that in
the center I kind of put a little bit
too much glue there but it'll dry clear
so don't worry okay so I decided to
change the placement of that star and I
have lash glue under my eye and that's
totally fine I'm going to take some
Midnight Cowboy and just start applying
it kind of like a teardrop you don't
need to make it super perfect we're
going to just start layering glitters
and stuff this could be affordably wrong
but we'll see we're in it together so I
have a brush nearby
just to scatter all the glitter I'm
gonna take a bigger piece of confetti
now that one right under my eye this is
just kind of wherever you want to put
something just kind of place it there
and hope for the best
basically I can make little dots with
this as well so it looks like they're
chunks of glitter confetti so you just
want to keep building like however you
want it's going to look really cool yeah
we're coming together
alright so that's what the glitter tears
look like you can add or take away or
not do the glitter tears at all you
could just do this green smokey eye I'm
going to finish it off with a nude lip
because you know the eyes are crazy
right now this is the Tarte any dip
there's a lot of their new rain forces
to see what sticks what what I'm sorry
I'm going to flip my top because this is
kind of distracting me a few moments
later alright and I'm just going to take
my touch of dewy skin miss you know
because I want to look alright so that's
it for this video thank you guys so much
