as you can see from the title in today's
video I'm going to be showing you guys
how I conceal all types of breakouts
while still making sure the skin looks
luminous and healthy and not too cakey
and that's really the trick as you guys
know sometimes your skin can be pop in
but sometimes it be like this so we
don't take it from this to this first of
all it's important that you guys know
that everybody has breakouts it's a
natural part of being human right we
have pores we break out and it's normal
and I know it sucks trust me even I get
really insecure and down about it
there's really not much we can do about
it but we can try to conceal and cover
it up I have been testing things how
they look in photos iPhone photos flash
photography video in in real life seeing
what works what doesn't work and I have
found I think the perfect combination
it's funny actually because Katie and I
will send photos of our breakouts and
that's just something we do we do that
and she will see me in person and be
like I swear you're like a ninja
covering breakouts it kind of gave me
the idea to do this video for you guys
and show you exactly what I do and it
was also really requested when I did a
snap video where I had full face of
makeup and I took it off and I showed
you guys that underneath I was really
breaking out so yeah let's go ahead and
get into it
it happens right now I have as you can
see some breakouts and I kind of had
some extractions as well that's why this
one's a little less scabs
everything is kind of healing but it's
still very red and there is still some
texture going on this is the belief aqua
balm and the reason I'm using this one
is because sometimes my skin gets very
dry and I need a cream to dilute the tea
tree oil that I'm also going to spot
treat my breakouts with just so that
they're healing and I seal them before I
put makeup on using the aqua balm get
yourself a nice smooth hydrated layer
next I'm taking the body shot tea tree
oil obviously my hands are clean I just
washed them I'm going to Pat this on to
all the breakouts one over here so then
you just kind of want to let it sit and
dry
up before you put any makeup on because
I am latina I do tend to get dark spots
where I breakout I've been using the
water bright dark spot corrector I've
also used a skin suitable one in the
past it worked really well for me too I
ran out of that one so I'm trying this
one out I use this at night before I go
to bed so that's just like a little
thing that I do to make sure that I
don't have any dark spots for too long
or they go away faster now it's time for
foundation to really cover everything up
when it comes to foundation when you're
breaking out I know especially me
sometimes I tend to feel insecure about
my breakouts and then out of nowhere I
just start piling on a lot of makeup and
then by the time I'm done I look in the
mirror and I'm like whoa my skin looks
cakey I went too far and sometimes it's
hard for me to control it like I'll just
keep packing on this most full coverage
foundation and through trial and error
I've found that that actually makes my
skin look worse so what I do now I like
to share down my foundation and give
myself an all-over application that I
would if I wasn't breaking out I have my
Armani luminous silk foundation here
number seven I like to dilute it with
Mac strobe cream I love this stuff this
is in the shade gold light this is just
going to make it not as full coverage
and it's going to give my skin that
luminosity there we go mix it all
together so you still want your skin to
look luminous and healthy and we're just
going to focus on really full coverage
where you have to break out since I
still have some of my brush this little
brush that I used to mix it I'm just
going to start applying it I just tan so
I don't know if this is going to match
me but this is usually my color this is
the brush I love to use the morphe g40
I'm going to use this to apply the
foundation all over the skin now that we
took all the product off the brush I
used to mix and I start kind of patting
it all over a little attraction now that
I have a nice even layer somewhat I'm
going to start prepping that in with my
Beauty Blender how so as I start
blending in the foundation to a nice
thin layer you can really see that the
breakouts start to shine through but
that's okay because we're going to focus
on those later so just make sure you're
over
all skin is evened out don't even think
about the breakout yet now I have a nice
light layer of foundation not full
coverage it sheared down so at this
point I go back in with a little bit
more of the mixture on my Beauty Blender
and all focus very lightly like do the
lightest little pounces around your
breakout areas and just find your cheat
you know I mean just like when I push
the foundation onto my skin I put it on
the areas that need the most coverage
and then I'll make sure to really blend
the edges and everything around the
point where I started with the
foundation really sharing out the edges
all right foundation done by only
applying more foundation where you need
it and then blending out those edges it
gives you a nice good base dewy still
very luminous but you're really focusing
on your problem areas that you have and
so far I feel like it's pretty good so
now we want to spot conceal all those
breakouts because even if your
foundation does do a good job at
covering throughout the day our
foundation tends to wear down right and
then things start seeping through if you
have any redness breakouts things like
that start to kind of come out so we
want to make sure to really target those
areas I'm going to use a hydrating
concealer because my breakouts like I
said tend to be dry a little bit crusty
I guess and I want to keep everything
really hydrated and luminous so I'm
going to use the Becca aqua luminous
concealer this is in the shade tan still
even a little lighter than what I need
but that's okay just kind of adjusting
but this is okay because we'll cover it
so just hitting all these spots boom
just doing little dots over them and
then I'm going to take the morphe g40
brush again and what I'm going to do is
just lightly tap over a couple of times
you want to tap over the breakout and
then you want to take the brush and
feather out the edges without tapping on
the breakout again right so you want to
blend the edges into your foundation if
you need to switch to a smaller brush to
do this make sure it's a nice soft brush
but just do tapping motions around the
breakout try not to touch the breakout
again because you want that full
coverage to stay over that red area and
then moving on to this breakout I need
some morphe brush first because it's
very soft and
number this was a massive scab - by
keeping it all luminous and hydrating
it's going to just make it look better
actually than when we started take a
little bit of the foundation on the
brush it's the tiniest amount kind of
make everything seamless around those
edges I'm barely barely tapping over any
of this do the same up here sometimes
I'll go back in one more time if I see
that it's still showing through a little
bit and just do the same technique
lightly press around the area so now we
have is a nice light layer foundation
which I diluted with a light reflecting
product so when I'm in the sunlight
which I've tested before everything's
going to look really dewy and fresh and
it's going to look pretty and only the
part where I have breakouts is where
there's a little bit more coverage but
it's not going to be as noticeable and
it's going to look better than an
all-over really heavy coverage what I'm
going to do next I'm going to just
finish off my under eyes with some
concealer since I didn't put any there
this is mediums Becca same concealer
just using a little bit of a lighter
color here I've been wearing a lot less
concealer and product on my under-eye
lately I just find it to photograph so
much nicer but obviously we need to
powder certain areas that tend to get
oily so I've just been kind of sticking
to powder in those areas and leaving the
rest of my skin alone with just the
liquid or cream product go boom I'm
going to go ahead and use the tiniest
amount of powder and this is my favorite
powder to set my makeup just because
it's so almost untraceable right so
usually what I put a powder on it's like
very you can see it it's almost like
melts into the skin and just reduces the
shine you can keep applying it
throughout the day and it's not going to
look cakey my nose that's really oily I
have to keep touching up my nose and it
doesn't like build up around that area
it's just really nice this is the elf
blush brush I love this brush you put a
little under the eye but I don't I don't
even set my under eyes anymore that much
just because this concealer that I use
when I use a very light amount it
doesn't need to be set and what's good
is that if I do tend to crease a little
bit more I just tap under my eye with my
finger and it likes ones
beautifully throughout the day so I'm
just going to put the tiniest amount
here and then also I'm going to press
this into the breakout areas that I put
concealer on right on the forehead and
also right here seal them in as a
charlotte tilbury airbrush finish
flawless skin perfecting micro powder
oops all along it this is the shade of
two so here is another issue when
breaking out sometimes we have those
breakouts that our assistant and they're
really big and bumpy right like
sometimes you have this lump and you
can't really hide texture right if you
have a pimple that's sticking out if you
can cover the redness and everything but
it may still look like it's sticking out
so when I have those bumpier breakouts I
take the Mac Studio Fix powder
foundation the stuff is really
full-coverage it's going to cover a lot
I don't want to put this all over my
face so because it's going to look to
full coverage and take away the luminous
look that we're trying to go for that
healthy skin look Katie always told me
I'm like a ninja covering big breakouts
and I pride myself in that I always feel
like it's like a mission that I
accomplished so when it comes to these
foundations you have to find the perfect
color if it's too light it's going to
show if it's too dark it's going to show
i sometimes mix colors just to make sure
that it's vibing with my skin tone first
going to do is take a fluffy brush this
one is Sedona lace EB 13 I'm going to
dip it into the studio fix powder
foundation this is NC 43 and I'm also
going to blend that with a little bit of
NC 40 just to get the right tone I put
gift back and forth into the two and I'm
going to push around the breakout so if
you have something sticking out you want
to start packing this on it and then
mostly around the breakout I feel like
when I build the powder foundation
around it and I'm tapping it super light
it almost gives it the appearance of
being very smooth because I'm creating a
blended layer of product around the
breakout that's my theory and always
make sure you're blending out the edges
because in the sunlight you may go
outside and see that you have splotches
of powder foundation so anytime you
apply it something to the breakout
really feather out the edges I swear you
guys this stuff this is like the best
trick you see the darkness right hand
already kind of gone these ones are more
flat but they just have pigmentation so
I'm just pushing this lightly on top of
those breakouts and then of course
blending out all the edges so now we
have just coverage like I said
everything's still lightweight for the
most part and you just really focus on
the breakouts wherever they may be now I
like to focus on the rest of the skin
looking extra glowy and healthy that way
when people look at your face they're
like wow her highlight or she's glowing
right you want to attract their eye to
something else and that's where my glow
comes in I'm going to be mixing the Marc
Jacobs do you drop's
and a little bit of the iconic London
drops these are a shade original and
this is the do you color 50 I'm just
going to mix up two on my petri dish
just one pump of each and I'm going to
take that down the bridge of my toe boom
tip of my nose to lift it a little bit
on the Cupid's bow and I love the chin
glow some people don't like that I love
it let's first blend this out before we
move on take the other side of the
beauty blender but you didn't apply the
product with and press that lightly into
the skin you don't want to move any
foundation around so make sure you're
pressing lightly we want it to all stay
on already the highlight on the nose
just makes the skin look really healthy
and that's really what you're going to
focus on if you have breakouts in any of
the areas that usually highlight in
don't apply highlighter over the
breakout it's very very important
because that's just going to make them
stand out like I had a breakout on my
chin here and so I applied highlighter
like not on top of the breakout I had to
either not apply it or only apply it
very targeted right above okay so see
this breakout it's not right on the
highlight line but I don't want to put
any highlight over at all so I'm going
to be very careful and kind of place it
in a C shape and just miss it and then
take the other side blend that all in
and if you happen to get a highlight on
it you can always apply a little bit of
powder over to cover it up but try not
to and then I'm also going to apply a
little bit right above the brow here all
the high points of your face and just
blend that in again so that's it for the
cream highlight and then again just in
case I I may have kind of got a little
little some--some here I'm going to go
in with the Charlotte Tilbury powder
some mattified
down I don't need any coverage so I'm
not going to use the Mac powder again
now that I've applied the highlight I
feel like I'm drawing people's eye
towards areas that I'm not breaking out
now to seal all of that in you don't
have to do this
of course I always like to add a lot of
glow so I'm going to use the bronze god
of heatwave by Estee Lauder and just
lightly go over that the trick is like
if you find that you have larger pores
in this area you don't want to
accentuate them just keep it right here
on the very very top of your cheekbone
just very very lightly and try not to
bring it down to the area where you have
more pores if that is something that you
struggle with even though other people
may bring it down here in other videos
or show you to like take it whichever
way just do it whatever way works best
for you
a light layer at the top I'm using a
Sephora fan brush and then I'm also
going to highlight the bridge of the
nose to the tip here just boom look at
that and now everything people are going
to focus on into the highlight okay
highlight there's to your face when you
like boom boom boom boom Meeta leader
someone finish off the face the skin
school as my brother says I say it
scheme to really tie everything together
this is very important too so I'm taking
my hoola bronzer by benefit and Mac 116
brush especially because I am breaking
out in this area I don't want to like
rub a lot because I don't want any of my
hard work to go away push it into the
skin here and do little tapping motions
also to mention really quickly you can
use a primer i know i did not use one
whatever your skin type is like if you
have redness you might want to use a
redness reducing primer if you have
larger pores so the tarte primer is
really good the pore perfecting once
whatever suits your skin type if you
feel flaky and dry use a hydrating
primer the makeup for everyone is one of
my favorites too so always prime for
your skin of course I use my hydration
balm as a primer i'm gonna be using Mac
peaches as my blush padding lightly and
a little bit over the nose and I feel
like it gives you that summer healthy
look when you get a little sunburned and
you look super sunkissed I'm going to
set the skin and I'm using the Hydra
enhancer this is by LC cosmetics
nice about this it has Jasmine in it and
it also helps calm the skin for example
if you had a sunburn or anything like
that so if your skin is irritated it's
going to help calm the skin and also set
your makeup you can apply this before
and after especially focusing on the
parts where I put all the powder with
the Studio Fix because I want it to not
look powdery and you guys all know my
last and favorite trick which is turning
larger bumps or breakouts into beauty
mark I use a really fine liner brush and
the Rockpile melt cosmetics I think it's
a nice dark brown to you I'm going to
try to focus on the very point the
highest point of the breakout and
lightly press on it
everything I say is lightly lightly
cat-like task like pals it's important
so you don't move any product around
when I turn my face look like a bump is
now just going to be a little beating
work I can also do it over the little
scab that I have here to try to distract
from it my mom has a lot of beauty marks
and I think they're so beautiful
my brother has them too he got them from
my mom and I just think they're so old
Hollywood and I love them so much I
don't know why I just have I think
they're so pretty when people have like
beauty marks or freckles thank you
you're welcome
and then after you have you know giving
yourself the beauty marks go back in
with a little bit of powder and just
press over them it's going to make them
look more natural because the rest of
your face kind of has powder and stuff
over it so if it's just like a dot with
no makeup over it it might look a little
more fake and this blends it also so I'm
just taking a little powder dusting it
over the areas and this is the finished
skin look you know we have our beauty
marks covering the ones that are a
little bit more bumpy but overall very
low coverage on the foundation a
luminous look people are going to think
you know you just have very healthy skin
and you know this varies with every
breakout some people have more breakouts
sometimes they're not as bad you just
kind of have to use these little tips
and tricks to adapt to how your skin
acting that day you know we all have
them it's okay
everyone gets insecure about them it's
just it's just something that happens in
life right we can't do anything about
getting the breakouts these are just the
things I do
to cover them when they are happening so
I think I can see like the glow that I
put on because we used creams it's not
going to look super stripy or chunky or
glittery we want to stay away from a lot
of glitter when you're breaking out or
if you have pores you don't want to show
here we packed on the powder but it
doesn't look cakey we made them into
beauty marks here here and then the
forehead right those were a little bit
more flat so you didn't have to do a lot
you can barely see them now you don't
really focus on them that much that's it
that's the whole skin look that's it so
we got going on nobody will ever know
I really hope you guys enjoyed all these
tips and tricks this is ultimately what
has looked and works the best for me so
I hope it helps some of you guys out let
me know on Twitter or in the comments if
you try this technique out and it works
for you thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye why does the trash matte
always come when I'm trying to live my
life is what I want to know in all types
