hey guys welcome back to my channel so
for today's video we're gonna be doing
this makeup tutorial so I was cruising
on Instagram like I do you know every
morning and I found this beautiful
boomerang on JD and NGOs Instagram
account which I will put right over here
this was such a beautiful boomerang
everything about this boomerang just
sang spring to me I did my whole
backdrop inspired by this image I'm
trying to be like really the model in
this image has freckles so I was like I
have to do the freckles because the
freckles are so gorgeous and if you have
freckles I mean just embrace them
because I think there are some of the
most beautiful features and I've always
really wanted them so I thought for the
look I would recreate it exactly as the
image shows really fresh dewy skin a
wash of color on the lid and then the
wash on the lips everything very creamy
or all about the creams and it's fairly
easy so if you guys are interested in
this makeup look then keep on watching
so let's go ahead and get started I'm
gonna start by priming my skin
everybody's been talking about this
tatcha primer the silk canvas looks like
this it almost looks like it's like a
very thick primer almost like the Tarte
primer and the primers are thick like
this it's better to just push them into
the pores really just fill those in I
have like a crater right here I wonder
if it would like I just shove it in
there back in my days when I used to not
know how to extract a breakout I still
do it actually I'm gonna put some of us
under my under-eye
maybe it'll fill those lines to
this is a foundation I've been using
recently it is the Lancome
tint Idol ultra wear pin so I am in the
shade 410 beat is w is what it says on
the back and I really really love the
way this foundation has been looking
I've only used it about four times when
I do more skin based looks and I want
the skin to look a little bit more like
skin I always mix a little bit of my
matte gold light in there and this is
just a reflective luminous moisturizer
for the skin by mixing it in there it
adds that luminosity and then it also
thins the foundation down just a little
bit but you still get that coverage it's
just not as thick it cosmetics fluffy
brush here and I'm gonna blend blend it
all together oh I just extracted right
here and it hurts still which means it's
coming back with a vengeance it's not
done with me yet okay so I just do a
nice thin layer of this all over and
then if I feel like I need extra
coverage you could always go in and spot
conceal with concealer or you can just
add a little bit more foundation and go
over those areas a little bit more the
trick with this look is to not make it
look like you are wearing foundation so
if there are some imperfections in your
skin it's not terrible
once you add freckles I feel like it'll
distract from everything else and just
show the freckles the only time I've
done faux freckles is for a doll
tutorial but let me tell you guys
something about freckles I think they
were so stunning if I see people on my
timeline that have freckles or like in
the Explorer page I just follow them I
know that some of my friends with
freckles are like if you had freckles
you wouldn't want them it's not always
the way it is though we never ever happy
I wasn't happy with my curly hair
growing up and now that it's gone I'm
like I won't my curly hair out alright
so now we have a nice base I'm gonna go
in with concealer I'm gonna be using the
k'kaw concealer in the shade and nine
right here
using my beauty blender I'm gonna go
ahead and blend that out I really like
this concealer I feel like it just
covers everything on the under eyes I
really like the undertone doesn't look
too cakey it looks nice
the trick to this look is not a lot of
powder products you want to keep your
skin looking very fresh very dewy think
juicy peach so I'm gonna be doing all
the liquid products first before I even
think about any powder I'm gonna be
going in with my favorite liquid combo
of glow products and that is the iconic
illuminator and the shade original and
then the Marc Jacob - do you draw mixing
on my palette start working that into
the cheekbones
above the brow here on the forehead area
a little on the chin judge for the
highlight over my breakout I think I did
that's a mistake
don't do that just cover that up juicy
peach thinking juicy peach whatever is
left over I'm just gonna run over the
Cupid's bow I'm not gonna put a lot
there for once and that is it for the
highlight already I feel very glowy
youthful youthful alright so for the
next step we're going to bronze up the
skin and with that I'm also gonna use a
cream it's all about creams today and
this is the ultra wear makeup stick by
Lancome in the shade 435 bisque W and
let me tell you I've been loving this to
warm up the skin just looks so nice puts
them under the lip here to accentuate
creams can be a little bit harder to
work with sometimes when it comes to
bronzing and contouring but this one is
really nice easy to blend to blend it
out I'm gonna be using a morphe g4t
brush you want to push the product up
and then I use the back of my hand to
kind of take off some of the product
kind of blending it up into the
highlight I'm very very gentle with the
way I'm blending this I'm not pushing
too hard
also apply that on the forehead because
we want our whole face to look nice and
bronzed I've got to blend out my this
just kind of gives you a under lip Shana
so it makes your lower lip look bigger
I'm pretty excited for summer right now
already I'm like ready for summer I
would like to go to Mexico actually I
used to go to Mexico all the time and I
haven't gone in so long so I think I'm
gonna plan a trip to go see my family up
there yeah one without me so she
couldn't even invite me see how easy
this blends out I mean that's just like
it's such a nice easy product to work
with I'm so
with it and then sometimes if I even
want to just just on the very very outer
part define it just a little more I'll
go back in add a little more product
bloom bloom bloom I would definitely
wear this like a tropical vacation a
light makeup base if any maybe just a
spot concealing but then just put this
all over my skin to just warm me up and
also take whatever is on your brush and
just kind of so now for a blush we're
gonna be using the NARS liquid blush and
this isn't the shade lustre this is my
first time using this actually I do is
take a clean Beauty Blender and I'm
gonna dip into that product and pounce
it on the back of my hand first because
you don't want to apply it too much
right away for a more fresh spring look
I like to put it on the apples of my
cheeks just give us like a little bit
more of a youthful appearance to me a
little ole goes a long way for this
blush I tapped most of the product off I
have to make that weird face across the
nose because you'd be sunny there you
were in the Sun you know when you feel
like there's a little hair somewhere on
your face but you can't you can't figure
it out it's there and it's taunting you
it's happening to me like right over
here I'm gonna take it even further
because I love love love this for that
really fresh juicy look on the cheeks
and it's the Becca Chrissy Teigen collab
I always use this one I want to add a
sheen to the apples of the cheeks a
little glow I'm using a Smith 112 brush
and then you got a smile okay see that
little mm-hmm-hmm you see that so then
it like goes down to your cheeks you
just look so sunkissed at this point if
you feel like you would like to powder
parts of your skin I'm gonna use a
really lightweight powder this is the
charlotte tilbury number 2 you don't
have to do this but if you have oily or
skin and you want to make sure that you
don't get too oily just go over those
like problem areas right so for me it's
around the nose
and not too many powders if you want to
set your under-eyes to you with a little
powder you can typically when I do
minimal makeup looks I don't set my
under eye I know that's crazy to some
people but I just like that if dirt
throughout the day it does crease I can
just kind of tap it a little bit and
blend it away now we can go in with the
fixed plus so we're gonna do freckles
last because I had the technique that
I'm going to be using I don't want to
get it on my eyelid and then I try to
blend my eyelids after with the
eyeshadow and then it smears the
freckles so I think I'm gonna dip into
this new Pat McGrath palette and this is
the mother ship sublime bronze ambition
this packaging is really really cool
love how she does this to close it that
image love it this is the colors I'm
really gonna focus on this color right
here I feel like that's the perfect
perfect shade for this eye look that
we're trying to do I'm gonna use a
little bit of this in the crease just to
start it off but not too much the matte
shade I'm using my Mac two to four I
love this brush for this kind of work
because it's so fluffy that it diffuses
the eyeshadow so nicely so I'm just
going in with that first color just to
get a nice diffused shadow that's not
shimmery all across we want to take a
nice small pencil brush this one is from
dose of colors and I'm also gonna run
that on the lower lash line focusing
most of the product on the outer corner
love about this eye look is it's very
easy and you only need two eyeshadows
it's nothing to define so it's like you
could do it really quickly and it just
still looks so romantic
sultry if you have green eyes game over
so just our light smoke focus it on the
outer corner first and whatever's left
on the brush then you take it in I'm
gonna take my blending brush make sure
to diffuse it just a little bit
underneath
all right so now it's time for the lid
color and like I said I'm gonna be going
in with this shade right here I feel
like it's such a pretty peachy color I'm
gonna use a flat shader brush but I'm
also gonna spritz it with a little fix
plus just start in the center of the lid
I'm just gonna kind of work it in so the
outer and inner corner slowly really
matches my backdrop actually this color
has a really nice wet effect look take a
little bit of the eye shadow the shimmer
shadow on the blending brush and I'm
going to diffuse that into the edges now
it's time for freckles which actually
terrifies me because we only have one
one shot one life one chance not Katy
and anyone her tattoo no okay
taking my water bottle here get a little
water don't spill it everywhere like I
just did so I'm taking a flat fluffy
shader brush right one that you feel
like you could just and you want to soak
it I'm nervous you guys I've never done
this before I'm gonna dip it into a dark
brown shade so espresso from the lorac
pro palette I feel like I should put my
hair back ready the closer you get the
bigger the freckles will be the further
away you get the smaller they will be
flick away
mine with a little more fine it's fine a
little too much water I got a little too
crazy there remember what I said about
powders we're gonna need a powder to
apply over these freckles once they dry
just to kind of make them look a tiny
bit more natural but I really like this
technique because as you can see it's
such a random placement of freckles so
it doesn't look too forced
and you can go in and add more or less
or you could not do the step at all if
you don't want to do the look without
the freckles but I think they're so cute
so I'm gonna keep them I think I'm gonna
use actually a Roach liner from urban
decay to finish off the eyes I think I
want to smoke out my lashline just a
little bit just to add some definition
not a wing or anything but just at the
base I'm also gonna take that on the
waterline so for mascara I'm gonna be
using the colossal Big Shot mascara and
this is in collaboration with makeup
Shayla and baddest black I'm just gonna
wiggle this into my base and then pull
it up just a nice light coat if you
naturally have long lashes I would just
do mascara for this look I wouldn't even
add falsies so I feel like that looks so
nice and soft and it will go with the
whole look I stopped using my Latisse
I'm on the struggle bus over here so I'm
gonna apply some falsies feel like when
I was using with teeth I could totally
just put mascara on and it was like
living my best life now applying the
iconic lights just cuz these are nice
and wispy fluffy and make the freckles
look a little bit more natural I'm
taking a little bit of this powder with
Charlotte Tilbury powder and I'm just
gonna press it over the freckles before
the lips I'm gonna be using the new Dior
Addict also my first time using these
and these two colors I feel like
together will be a really perfect
mixture this is the
six for one orange and then this one is
three for one lychee let's start with a
lighter one in the center here I'm
smells so good
so this is gonna be the perfect product
for this look now because it has a
really pretty sheer like it just goes
with the vibes and it goes with like the
textures all the textures are meant to
be very sheer like washes basically our
whole face is a wash of color I really
like this color I just want to add a
tiny bit of orange let's see let's test
it out I want to add a little bit more
orange to the look so I'm just gonna go
over it
so making it a little bit more red a
little too red pull back I liked the
other color by itself let me try to
dilute it that's actually really pretty
now I'm gonna try this the four three
eight Dior Addict lipstick I'm just
gonna lightly tap it oh yeah that just
kind of brought it home to like the
perfect shade oh yes perfect color combo
I'm so happy with that
I'm shouting a little highlight you know
my shoulder blades
gotta stay consistent here alright so
this is the finished makeup look I love
this lip combo together oh my god
marking it is one of my new favorites
already lost it these two so good lychee
and then the Dior Addict lipstick and
four three eight like that is such a
perfect color for spring love that I
feel like it's so fresh dewy radiant
you're just glowing from within if you
have freckles Oh beautiful
it's everything I wanted I want it to
look like a juicy peach and I feel like
that's what this look is just a juicy
fresh dewy a speech I mean this is one
