is going to be a tutorial on this makeup
look right here here here here here I
did a pretty dramatic wing soft eye and
then a really topi lash line and I did
this lip combo which is one of my
favorites right now so you guys will see
what that is also I focused a lot on
skin in this video like all coverage
give it to me
contour highlight like heavy coverage so
if you guys are interested then keep on
watching first thing I do is prep my
skin I will be using the Smashbox photo
finish primer water for my face I'm
going to be mixing Mac Studio Fix fluid
which is like an all-time favorite you
know it's been tried and true since the
beginning of time and then I'm gonna
drop a few drops of this L see the glow
enhancer a dry face oil it's
particularly good for dry skin so I just
like to take a little bit on the back of
my hand what I like about mixing the oil
into the foundation is that it's gonna
dilute it just a little bit it's still
going to cover everything but it's not
going to look as heavy
I just put about three drops into the
foundation and I'm just going to start
working that into the skin this is the
NC 40 I usually like to do my eye makeup
first and then my foundation but what
I'm going to be doing an eye look that's
a little bit more on the softer side I
don't mind doing my foundation first
however if you're going out for like
long event and you're gonna be wearing
your makeup for a really long time I
like it to last as long as possible so
when you do at last obviously you're
gonna have a little bit more wear time a
lot of you are asking for an updated
brow tutorial but my technique is still
really the same I use a brow pencil in
the beginning and then dip brow on the
ends and then on more natural days I
just use a brow pencil it's pretty much
the same as I've been doing it I just
switched products from time to time
maybe there's a specific brow pencil you
guys want to see and I could just throw
it into a tutorial so you just really
want to work the foundation into the
skin I've watched a video clip from
Mario the makeup artist and I know he
said the reason that his makeup looks so
good is because he works the foundation
into the skin really really well so I
always keep that in mind always make
sure that you drag the foundation on
your ears and your neck or else you
might be looking kind of crazy sometimes
you can't really see that you look crazy
until you take photos and then you see
like a streak of foundation here and
then the rest of your neck is just like
white or like a different skin color or
maybe your face is white and your neck
is Tanner you just want to make sure
it's all cohesive next I'm going to go
straight into just warming up the skin
I'm going to be using the LA girl Pro
concealer and this is in the shade post
I'm going to be using this to contour I
just really blend it out so that it's a
little bit more of a bronzed look go in
with the pro concealer in creamy beige
just want to focus on the skin a lot for
this look I actually really like that
contour color I was a little scared of
it at first but it looks nice I like to
highlight with cream products I don't
usually contour with cream products but
because I want my skin to look a little
bit more luminous and not as powdery I'm
using this to bronze up my face use one
side to blend out the contour and then
use the other side to blend out the
highlight this is the morphe 27 brush
it's really nice for the under eye area
I'm also going to use this to contour my
nose take a little bit more of the
lighter color that we use and go along
the edges right here this is going to
take away any shadows on the nose that
make your nose appear to be wider and
then also put it down the center gun
he's my mini Beauty Blender here blend
that all out what I like about these
concealers is they blend really well so
it's not as scary as it looks to do this
I usually don't my cream contour because
sometimes I feel like it can look kind
of crazy but for some reason this
concealer just blends out so nicely once
it's all blended out it just kind of
gives a good nice shadow on your with my
concealer brush just popping out the
center I'm also going to use this brush
to really soften any edges so no it
doesn't look like I have just two lines
going down my nose
now I'm going to take my Sonia
Kasia sparkling sands highlights going
to grab that onto my finger and start
applying that to the top of my
cheekbones times I use one finger to
apply the product and then the next one
to blend so it's more controlled
distribution of product I'm going to set
my under eyes using the Kat Von D shade
and light palette and I'm going to be
mixing the lightest color and the peachy
shade together on my dose setting
cartridge we want to make sure you do
patting motions and not swiping motions
when I'm going out I like to set my
contour with the Studio Fix powder by
Mac because it's super full coverage
it's going to really just make your face
look Photoshop it's amazing I don't use
it every day but for special events you
want to look just flawless this is the
good stuff I'm going to apply that with
my tapered blush brush my dose of colors
pack it a little bit and then start
blending it out also take that around
the hairline so now we're going to do
the highlight this is the gilded honey
laura geller and i'll be using this fan
brush by japonesque I love these brushes
especially this one I'm just gonna go
ahead and oh yeah the action going here
oh yes girls I'm doing the most in this
tutorial so I mean I'm aware but you
just want to really blend it out make it
look natural just like you're not even
wearing anything it's just a natural do
I love when people say like oh that
highlight doesn't look natural and if
there's sparkles in here it's supposed
to look natural I don't think so I love
a strong nose highlight
for blush I'm going to be using the
benefit blush in dandelion and I'm just
going to use the same tapered blush
brush that I used for my contour okay
dandelions not really working out for me
similar in color this is Mac Melba blush
before I do my eye makeup I'm just gonna
set my face makeup using mac's fix+
for good luck just do one more alright
moving on to the eyes I'm going to be
using Mac's 24 hour extend eyeshadow
base and applying that all over my lid
make sure to buff an even layer across
the whole lid and brow bone and I'm
using a sigma precision round brush for
this now I'm going to set that eye
shadow using a BH fresh shadow and the
dose of colors shader brush somebody
told me they were discontinuing Mac
Blanc type and I just think that's a big
mistake why would you do such a thing
sometimes I think Mac just continues the
best products or makes the best product
limited edition and I just don't
understand like the highlighters that
they put out and then they're gone like
whisper of guilts I just don't get why
they do that the next I'm taking makeup
geeks tiki hut and a Smith - 3 - brush
and blending that into the crease
next I'm picking up colour-pop Wilshire
and a packing nut all over my lid next
I'm going to go back into the tiki hut
shade by makeup geek and I'm going to
blend out the edges of the shadow so
that it all looks nice and smooth and
then I'm also going to take that same
eye shadow on a pencil brush by dose of
colors and smoke out my lower lash line
then I'm going to go in with my ardency
in pen liner this is hunker I'm going to
create a wing so I like to create the
wing first with a pen like this and then
I'll fill it in I'm going to be using
the NYX gel liner with the dose of
colors fine liner brush just going to
apply some mascara and pop on the Queen
B lashes real quick and I'll be right
back next I'm taking dose of colors
sticks and stone and I'm going to pop
that on the inner corner of my eyes I
decided to smoke my lower lash line out
with the makeup forever s50 pencil so
I'm just going to put that in the
waterline and then smoke it down it's
like a nice topi shade such an
attractive face always when I apply this
lower line earthlike I really like this
color it's very smoky next I'm taking
color pops swerve liner and smoking out
the outer part of the lower lash line
swerve is just a black liner then we can
take our little blending brush and buff
that out
then you just want to apply some mascara
to your bottom lashes oh I just
flung mascara on my face that's just
going to be a freckle Stan for the lips
I'm going to do a mixture of a lip liner
and a liquid lipstick color pop chorus
okay so we're going to fill the whole
lip in with this pencil over top of that
I will be using the a BH liquid lipstick
in stripped tone down this dark color a
little bit alright and that's it for
this makeup look we are all done let me
