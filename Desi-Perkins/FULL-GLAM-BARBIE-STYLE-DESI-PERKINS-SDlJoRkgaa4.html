channel today's video is gonna be a
makeup tutorial on this look it's giving
me Barbie vibes it's giving me a Bratz
doll vibes it's giving me just doll
vibes I think I really wanted to do
something was like a vibrant neon pinky
purple type of vibe these are the colors
I chose I challenged myself not to use
Browns in the crease or a noodle it
wanted to do something different with
that said let's go ahead and get started
so the first thing I did was apply a
little scotch tape just so I have a nice
clean line usually this doesn't work for
me but I'm gonna try it anyways because
I see it working for a lot of people and
I'm just like what's the wizardry first
shadow I'm gonna go into is called saucy
mists and this is by Mac and I'm gonna
apply it with a Mac two to four brush
we're gonna go ahead and apply this to
the outer corner of our eye and then
we're gonna take it into the upper
crease dang it's been a while since I
haven't used the brown in the crease you
know I'm trying to change it up here
hate it with a little color and don't
worry about the lid cuz we're gonna
cover the lid space so you don't have to
be super neat there I'm gonna get a
slightly smaller brush I'm gonna take a
Smith 230 just really get into the
crease and the inner part of the eye
here cuz I don't want it to get too far
up into my brow bone in this area now
we're gonna head into a purple color and
I have to use this cuz it's so sick it's
one of those things I'm upset that I
didn't think of type of packaging this
is the Mac and Jeremy Scott collection
low-five palette I know some people this
throws them off that it's like not full
but I'm kind of like it's supposed to be
the music so I get it I'm gonna go into
this matte purple eyeshadows I'm gonna
use the Smith 247 brush and we're gonna
deepen everything we just did when
winging out the outer part of the eye
you want to hold your brush upwards
because the tip of the brush has the
most pigment and then the bristles will
blend for you if you hold your brush
like this on this outer part of the eye
I'm gonna be putting purple eyeshadow
all on the lid as well it doesn't have
to be
we're gonna cover it up just gonna keep
applying the product all the way in now
that we did the crease we're gonna go
into the lid I'm gonna be using the
urban decay Kristin Leone palette I feel
like my eyes actually look like this
packaging right now which was not
planned I'm gonna take this purple shade
here it's called die and I'm gonna apply
it to the need I'm just gonna use a flat
concealer brush this is gonna be called
the bitch's back tutorial because I feel
like I haven't filmed a makeup tutorial
in a minute so you just really want to
pack this on make sure that it's all the
way blended into the crease just like
with little patting motions go back in
with my blending brush just melt all
these shades together and now we're
gonna take the tape this is like the
moment of truth oh I think that worked
out so now I'm just gonna clean up all
this fallout here makeup boy Costco my
faves boy finish off the eyes emoji the
face makeup I think for today's
foundation I'm gonna go back to a
classic I used to use this so much on my
channel that I stopped using it for a
little bit cuz I felt like it was
getting repetitive but I do love this is
my favorite drugstore foundation the
matte and poreless by Maybelline I'm
gonna go ahead and apply this foundation
using my LC sponge I like using this
beauty sponge because it's larger and it
just gets the job done quicker sometimes
now that we've done our foundation we're
gonna go ahead and move on buzz a
concealer I'll be using my Becca what is
this cold eye we use it almost room I'm
gonna be using all the guys in the room
know the name of the concealer sometimes
I just have brain farts and just apply
it in the usual areas blending it out
you guys I'm digging this makeup look I
really am I'm liking it
what do you guys think about me bringing
on other makeup artists celebrity makeup
artist to do my makeup on
my channel like tutorials from them
there's so many things out there that I
haven't seen when I get my makeup done
by other artists and I'm like wow this
is incredible
let's set these under eyes with a little
loose powder I'm gonna be using Laura
Mercier translucent powder can I just
tell you guys there are certain days I
can't get myself not to create this is
one of those days I feel really dry
which means I need to drink a little
more water and you stop sleeping with
the heater on but just know that that
happens to me as well if that happens to
you like certain days your under eyes
just look like what's going on what did
I do to deserve this it happens just to
lift this area I'm gonna let that bake
for a minute I think I'm gonna use a
black liner in the waterline I want to
go in with mr. right this is by the balm
cosmetics I really like this liner I
feel like it just looks super dark and
it shows up they wanted to do is take a
pencil brush and just blend out those
edges defuse the black we're gonna just
go ahead and take the same shades we
used and we're gonna smoke that lower
lash line out keep it close to this
black connecting to the top over here in
this corner now that I have smoked out
my lower lash line I'm going to
highlight my inner corner with lunar by
NARS kind of matches my backdrop a
little bit I'm gonna hit it with a
little fix+ and just highlight the inner
corners still bacon over here Oh anyway
was said hoola by benefit I'm taking my
lcd one brush and I'm gonna contour my
nose slightly after I've done that I'm
gonna put a little bit of that on my
Cupid's bow to deepen it I'm gonna give
a overall bronzed I'm gonna use this
Smashbox sheer powder brush instead of
contouring my cheeks and stuff I'm just
gonna do a subtle bronze because the
eyes are already kind of crazy I leave
bronze my ears to lift the tracks bronze
the hairline bronze the jawline so you
wouldn't use a bigger fluffier brush
like this it's more diffused sheer soft
I'm going to use a new highlight today
the Becca shimmering skin Perfector
in Parisian nights boom this is a
collaboration product and I will put her
name right here
Bing Bing I'm not gonna go overboard
though because I don't want a lot of
highlight my eye makeups already popping
so what we did go into the best just
gonna take a little city color brush and
apply it to the tip of the nose well see
how much straighter that made mine it
was just like whoa keep its bow and then
I'm just gonna apply a little bit of on
the cheeks and I'm not gonna apply a lot
like I said just right here okay and I'm
gonna take it up into the temple just
off this powder as well
for the blush I'm gonna be using
blossom time rose and this is a powder
blush by Milani cosmetics we are going
to take that right in-between the
highlight and the bronzer to bring a
little color to the face I always like
to start with a little blush and then
build it from there depending on my eye
look I like to take a blush that has
similar tones to what we used on the
eyes or the lips if you don't have I
makeup on tie the whole look together I
had a little shadow here I'm baking the
side of my nose a little bit longer I'm
gonna be taking grind from Urban Decay
cosmetics and I'm gonna apply a little
bit of this in the inner corner right
here just a kiss so it's time for a
little mascara I'm gonna be using the
bad gal bang by benefit and I'm just
gonna hit this with a light coat on my
lashes before I apply my falsies I
stopped using Latisse because I got lazy
and I have like no lashes again so I
need to stay consistent so hard it's
already so many steps to my nighttime
routine you know it's just like another
thing I'm in there for like 30 minutes
gonna miss goddamn ass I don't have time
you know I don't like how sharp this
edges over here I'm gonna also diffuse
that a little bit I do want the sharp
look but I just want to buff out those
edges so it doesn't look like I had a
piece of tape there I'm gonna go ahead
and apply my iconic light lashes wore
them yesterday so they're gonna be
hopefully easy to apply today I'm just
adding a little bit of the House of lash
glue for the lips I'm going into my
Beauty lipliner in the shade 64
I'm gonna go and just feather that in I
feel like I need like a fuchsia pink
let's try this color by Fenty Oh No a
little much let's try this one by urban
decay this is exhibition I'm not really
sure I like this pink at all I'm just
going to rub off the center going in
with bite Beauty lip liner and this is
in the shade 86 we're trying a few
different colors however it's hard to
find the right undertone that I'm
looking for I think the look needs a
little gloss so I'm using curvy this is
that I love set up a color pop collab
alright that is it that's the finished
makeup look what do you all think I
think it's giving me Barbie Bratz doll
vibes which I really like I hope you
