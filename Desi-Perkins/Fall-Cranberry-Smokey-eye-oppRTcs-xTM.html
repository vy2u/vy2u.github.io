today's video is gonna be on this makeup
look here it's a really really cranberry
warm toned look I think it's perfect for
November just because of all the
cranberry stuff I don't know sir
cranberries with your turkey whatever I
really think it's perfect for the season
hope you guys enjoy the tutorial let's
go ahead and get started
so the first thing I'm gonna do is prime
my eyes with Mac soft ochre Paint Pot is
the wave a concealer buffer for this I
pick up a bone colored shadow this is
Blanc by Anastacio Beverly Hills and I'm
just going to run that all over the brow
bone down to the crease this is going to
set the soft ochre Paint Pot alright so
the next thing we're going to do is go
in hard with anasazi Beverly Hills
orange soda this is going to be our
transition shade I'm going to try to
focus this on the upper crease area a
comparable color to this which is also
amazing is makeup geek Peach Smoothie so
this one goes more in the upper crease
want that really nice light peachy halo
the very top of all of your shades that
you're going to put in the crease for
the picture I posted on Instagram I
actually use Sienna from Auto Stasi
Beverly Hills in the crease but for the
sake of the video just because honestly
you see out of every single time I'm
going to try out morocco this is by
makeup geek it's one of their new matte
shadows I'm putting it right below the
orange soda slightly above the crease
line it's very slight I think I need a
Sienna but you know what I got to use
Sienna because that's what I had done so
I'm gonna go in with Sienna so sorry
Sienna is this color by the way I mean
I'm sure you guys know it's just like a
reddish brown something similar to this
would be a brown script by Mac go in
hard with this I'm just going to keep
picking it up and building the crease
see this has a little bit more of a
reddish brown tone which is going to
pull together all the cranberry shades
that we will be using just taking a
cleaner brush clean ish brush and
feathering out the edges here okay so
the next thing we're going to do is
deepen up the crease even more I'm using
cherry cola this is a makeup geek matte
shadow use a sigma e25 blending brush
just because it's a little bit more slim
so it's going to get that defined crease
look that we need with the darker shade
and this one is just going directly into
my eyeball socket like just stick it in
there and blend I like to start it right
here when I apply the eye shadow in the
socket line
in it get it in without sign of sexual
you guys been watching American Horror
Story Lady Gaga like slays in that show
she is everything and more her outfits
her hair her makeup you guys haven't
seen it like honestly I feel like I
watched it just to see her and like how
she's gonna how she's going to look so
I'm just going to keep building this
color up pick up a little bit more
product just a little flick it out
so now you have this little gradated
wingy thing this is the star of the eye
look this is the new Kat Von D metal
crush eyeshadow and it's in the shade
raw power it's such a pretty metallic
cranberry shade
all right cool I've already applied
foundation the foundation I use today
was the fit me by Maybelline
you know why does it look so crusty and
I'm in the shade 228 going on with my
concealer today I'm going to be using
the NARS creamy concealer in the shade
custard I'm going to be highlighting
with this taking it down to Chinatown
back up
kind of going hand with the concealer
right now I'm just going to blend it out
with my Beauty Blender
going in with my japonesque 915 brush
and my Laura Mercier translucent powder
I'm gonna lightly set my under eyes I'm
just gonna put a light amount don't want
to do any baking my under eyes have been
looking and we're really dry lately and
if your under eyes are dry and you try
to do the baking technique you're gonna
look like the Tales from the Crypt I
know from experience my under eyes have
been really dry and when you bake the
powder kind of tightens your skin a
little bit and I'm just telling you it
was terrible I did it the other day I
was like No
so I'm gonna highlight the inner corners
of my eyes and my favorite thing to use
is my this is the mary lou manizer by
the balm it's a highlighter super bright
highlight one of my favorites I'm taking
that on a small detailed shader brush by
zoeva and popping that in the inner
corners
I loved it so much so much I'm going to
use Siena again on the lower lashline
you pretty much want to repeat it's a
little bit less steps I'm just going to
be using Siena and cherry cola on the
lower lash line now to deepen it up and
smoke it out so first I'm going to go in
with Siena I like to first lay down the
color with a smaller brush and then if I
need to blend the edges I'll use a
fluffier brush
this is a good trick to cover your under
eye wrinkles not that I have any dirty
alright so after you've done that you're
gonna pick up cherry cola is that what's
called cherry cola yes and I'm going to
add this to the outer part of the eye
only so just about half way you're going
to stop and try to connect it to the top
take a little bit more of the Kat Von D
shadow on the shader brush and I'm just
going to put a little bit of it into the
inner lower lash line just add like a
slight shimmer apply some coats of
mascara to your lashes top and bottom
this is the Tarte lights camera flashes
go ahead and apply my false lashes these
are the house of lashes iconic obviously
so the trick to eye lashes and with
these in particular I mean with all
lashes but you guys asked me how to
apply these in particular I come from up
top so you just want to like instead of
coming this way you know you want to
come like no and I kept my eyes open too
I don't close my eyes or like look down
I just come from up top
you ever have one eyelash that goes one
way and the other goes another it's
because of the direction that your hands
go in so I'm sure if whatever hand you
use you go this way but then once you
put the other eyelash you tend to come
at your eye in a different direction
which makes the eyelashes like also go
to different direction so you just go
straight up it'll be the same on both
eyes I got a new benefit what's up this
is a cream highlight my finger and apply
this as a base for my powder highlight
on my cheekbones just going to take this
and pop it onto the tops of my
cheekbones top of the cream highlight
I'm going to be applying the eyo it's
kind of hard to see but this is the
Becca Jacqueline Hill palette and I'm
going to be taking champagne pop which
is the center color right here whatever
is left over on my brush just going to
like lightly drag it down for my nose
and Cupid's bow I'll be using the mary
lou manizer to highlight because you
guys know I like my nose highlight to be
pop in glow-in-the-dark beacon of light
I've actually had Steven one time be
like you're something on your nose and
wipe it and I was like what I want it to
be that way I want a bright ass nose
highlight thank you
right Harper bronzer time and you guys
already know what that means
Matt give me something thank you so much
morphe brush the m-52 seven just to give
it all over town forehead without
getting myself a bronzer helmet for
blush I'm going to use Mac's pinch me
okay and I'm going to apply that with my
Mac 168 brush which is this one right
here I like to like kind of smile my
cheeks like and put it on the apples
kind of do like a like a swoop so lastly
we have the lips and I'm going to be
using the girl act acai matte lip paint
and this is in the shade posh
