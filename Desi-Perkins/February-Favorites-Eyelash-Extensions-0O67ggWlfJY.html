today's video is gonna be my favorites
of the month
so let's go ahead and get into all the
products that I have here the first
thing I'm gonna start out with is
something that I'm like majorly obsessed
with loving a tan deluxe bronzing mousse
I'm not a huge fake tan type of person
like I've never been one to obsess over
tanning
I think it's cuz I'm Mexican and I get
really dark in the summer the color it
gives you is beyond beautiful it's the
vacation tan that everybody wants it's
not so much an orange undertone it has a
very olive undertone which is amazing
like that's the kind of tan that you
want it comes with an applicator I will
say this applicator that it comes with
made it really difficult for me to apply
it at first I thought it was the formula
and I was like wow this stuff is
actually kind of hard to blend in but
then I used another mitt that I had from
another tanning kit and it was a lot
easier so the two colors that I have
used from this tanning system is the two
hour Express and this is in the shade
dark and it's for medium to dark skin
tones and then the one I use the other
night is the ultra dark and this one
says it's her experience tanner is only
so I was a rebel because I'm not
experienced but it came out amazing and
it was super easy to apply I recommend
these Tanner's if you guys haven't tried
them I know you guys wanted a review
because I did post them on Instagram but
my review is they're amazing easy to
blend they're not blotchy best tanner
I've ever used and it has an olive
undertone which is amazing because we
don't want to look super orange up in
here okay it's there so the next item
I'm going to talk about is the Tarte lip
palette by Tarte cosmetics you guys have
seen me use this in my videos recently
this is just an amazing
neutral matte palette you guys know I
love neutral colors and I love matte
eyeshadows because I feel like
where was I there's really nothing
negative about this palette the blend
ability of the eyeshadows is amazing the
pigment is great there's no fallout and
it's just a great palette it's also
super cute like I love the packaging I
think it's really like Barbie s for
primers this month I have been loving
loving loving to primers you guys have
seen me use both of these and I'll tell
you why they're my favorites for
different reasons I'll start first with
the Tarte primer this is the Tarte clean
slate timeless smoothing primer and this
one is more of a thick consistency
definitely something that will help if
you have larger pores because it's
really gonna fill them in that's why I
like this when I want to do more of a
full coverage makeup look I'm definitely
going for this also really good to block
out any sweat or oil it just gives you a
smooth base for your foundation for
everyday makeup I love to use if you
make it forever HD high definition
primer this primer is really lightweight
it feels very moisturizing it gives my
skin a really dewy look and that's why I
like it for everyday it's just super
light I definitely recommend this one I
lost the cap because I was the cap to
everything Make Up For Ever HD another
face product I have been loving this
month is the benefit puff off instant
eye gel to help smooth the look of
puffiness so this stuff is awesome I
used it for the first time in my JLo
video and I actually asked you guys if
you notice the difference throughout the
video you guys told me that it made a
huge difference I looked at the footage
in all second it did make a big
difference I tend to get super puffy in
the morning and just a fact about me I
do not film in the morning I don't do
anything in the morning because I look
have you guys ever seen the Emperor's
New Groove like yzma you guys know who
I'm talking about if you guys like
Disney movies like me I have like the
worst puffiness like I don't know why I
look so puffy in the morning but I do
and this stuff I've been loving the
packaging of this is super cute it
actually has a little iron or a little
Blanchette on the end of it and it even
has a picture of it right here so this
is an instant eye gel to help smooth the
look of puffiness and the little iron at
the end is cold to the touch so I
actually did it wrong in my Jayla video
I applied it and then I
my fingers to Pat it in but you're
actually supposed to Pat it in with this
applicator because it is very cold and
the coldness of it is supposed to reduce
the puffiness as well I found that it
works either way whether I use my finger
or whether I use this applicator
honestly it takes so long to blend it in
with this applicator that I'm just like
I'll use it for a second and then I'm
like no okay so you guys know I'm a big
fan of eyebrows because I don't have
them mm but I try my best to make them
look as natural as possible and I have
been using less eyebrow products lately
kind of trying to go for the most
natural brow that I could get it's
really hard for me because I don't
really grow brow hairs here it's a
hereditary I believe because my mom has
it and my aunt has I don't shave them
off I don't pluck them off I just don't
grow them there I've been using this
honest hacia brow Wiz in the shade
caramel the color is perfect for my hair
color because it's not too light and
it's not too dark it just has that
really nice slight warm undertone it
doesn't smudge off throughout the day it
stays it's very hard it's not creamy so
like creamy eyebrow pencils tend to
smudge away the pencil gives me a more
natural effect on the brows bottom line
is for every day I have been loving this
and I've been using this eyebrow pencil
okay so the next thing I'm gonna talk to
you guys about is the Anastacio liquid
lipsticks i'm sure i'm like late to the
game I've been using these but I haven't
really put them in a favorites video
some of my favorite colors are pure
Hollywood and American doll because it's
the perfect red and this is like a
really great nude these are slightly
different than any other liquid lipstick
I've tried in the sense of the texture
the texture almost feels like a you know
the NYX matte lip what are they called
like the matte lip creams they have a
really soft creamy texture these have
that same feeling however they dry
completely matte so they don't transfer
you can kiss mm-hmm
you can goose you can eat and this stuff
is gonna stay on all day and the thing
about wearing a bold lip is I'm always
fearful that it's like on my teeth or
like on my chin after I II and that
doesn't happen with these some liquid
lipsticks can be very drying and these
don't dry your lips out at all and
they're amazing I absolute
love them so the next item I'm going to
talk about is this Milani blush it just
feels like a high-end product these
blushes make you glow from within I have
a few of these colors and I love all of
them
this one is rose de Oro de Oro rose they
they have the most beautiful sheen
doesn't make you look too shiny or
anything nikkietutorials
my homegirl on YouTube she uses luminoso
a lot she uses it a lot
just like I use matte give me son that's
like the equivalent of how much she uses
it and so I was like I need that blush I
need it I need it in my life and I got
it and I love it I love all of their
colors they're beautiful they have a
really large range of colors yeah Milani
baked blush is go try them they're
amazing the next thing I'm going to talk
to you guys about is these you a cream
highlight oh this is the best cream
highlight I've ever tried in my life
this is in the shade I'm gonna say this
wrong I call it t air but I'm sure it's
like tre or TA or I've already gone too
far as to pronounce it t air that I
can't really take it back like you know
when you sing a song you sing the wrong
lyrics and then you just keep singing
the wrong lyrics even though you know
that you're wrong
that's pretty much how I have gotten
with this but this cream highlight is
unlike anything I've ever tried I really
don't care for cream highlighting
products I kind of feel like they can
tend to sit on the skin weird it's hard
to put them over powder you really can't
it's it's just not my thing
cream highlights never been my thing
this cream highlight is my jam I just
use my finger to apply it's super quick
super easy and it almost just looks like
a glow from within it's not super
glittery if I don't want to wear a lot
of makeup sometimes I'll just put this
on the high points of my face and I just
look healthier like it's just so
beautiful and I love it and I don't know
what else to say it's just really good
so a non beauty item that I've been
loving is this giant water mason jar I'm
like obsessed with this thing it does
not leave my side these days I made a
vow to myself that I would drink more
water because I suck at drinking water I
drink a lot of coffee and I
get to drink water so I wanted to
challenge myself to drink at least six
of these a day this is a 32 ounce
container and I have been drinking a lot
it's almost like a challenge for me and
when it's empty I'm like oh I need to go
fill it up again
I always put lemon in it just because I
feel like it looks cuter and when
something looks cute I want to use it
that's just such a typical girl thing of
me to say but it also tastes better and
sometimes I'll put strawberries in here
or cucumbers and lemon it's just I don't
know I love this I got it at Target it's
insulated also so it keeps everything
really cold it doesn't press
what's that perspire put some perspire
you know yeah it doesn't that's what I'm
trying to say right you know when it
gets wet on the outside brain-dead I
love this I take it everywhere I
recommend you guys drink a lot of water
because if you drink a lot of water your
skin will be really nice so do it
so another thing I've been loving lately
is sunglasses like really fun funky
sunglasses I just think they make an
outfit super cute and it's just fun to
switch up your sunglasses every once in
a while so I'm gonna show you guys a few
of my favorites I recently was gifted
these and these are by woodsy these are
made out of wood and I think that's
super cool it's even carved on the
inside it says would leave they have a
retro vibe and I just think that they're
different they're unique they're made
out of wood that's really cool they
match my hair color kind of you know so
I dig it I've been getting a lot of
questions on these I posted them on
Instagram boom you guys can see
everything so these are actually got at
Nordstrom's they were only $12 hey I saw
them and I was like I need those
sunglasses they're cute they're $12
ray-ban makes some looks just like this
and I think they're really expensive so
holla I have these two sunglasses from
Kwai the first ones are these boom
these are awesome because they're huge
it can be like incognito with these and
nobody is gonna see your face because
they're so big all their sunglasses are
fairly priced I think there are around
$40 this other pair that I have here are
Cateye and they're clear how cute are
these they're so fun
super cute alright so lastly I have this
mascara this is by benefit you guys know
I'm not a huge mascara person because my
eyelashes are not long mascara to me is
just something to make my eyelashes
blend with my false eyelashes however I
did go to a party for benefit and they
were launching this mascara they were
presenting it as a mascara that will
curl your lashes without using an
eyelash curler but it's supposed to give
you the same effect so I was super
skeptical like no way like that's
impossible to me that a mascara wand
will curl your lashes I actually tried
it and it worked like it really does
work this is a great mascara I was so
surprised I was super excited to share
it with you guys I really want to see it
on somebody who has longer eyelashes
I've only tested it on myself obviously
and it curled my little bitty lashes
really nicely this mascara is phenomenal
if you guys are looking for a new
mascara this one is the bomb and the
packaging super cute
speaking of lashes I know you guys are
very curious to hear my thoughts on
eyelash extensions because I did get
them done right before I went to New
York and I just quickly wanted to
mention why I went to New York because I
did share it on my snapchat but I did
not share it with you guys here on
YouTube and I'm really excited about it
I didn't even want to talk about it
until it happened because I'm just I
don't know I'm I'm always like
superstitious about talking about things
if they haven't happened because I feel
like oh my god what if they don't happen
and anyways I got asked to shoot a
two-page spread with Cosmo latina and I
thought it was just like the biggest
honor I was super excited and I'm so
happy that I finally get to talk to you
guys about it the shoot was insanely
amazing and I just oh I was it was one
of those pinch me moments where you just
feel like is this really happening did I
just shoot for Cosmo like I don't know
it was awesome and so thank you guys
because it was definitely revolved
around YouTube and I just wanted to
thank you guys back to eyelashes they
wanted to shoot me a little bit more
natural with less makeup and which is
totally fine like I love less makeup I
love the more light makeup type of look
but I don't have eyelashes I just don't
have very good hair growth I guess you
could say
you guys know my eyebrows are very
sparse my eyelashes are very tiny I've
actually like never grown hair on my
legs random fact I've never had to shave
my legs because I just don't really grow
hair it's it's very strange so I think
it's just hereditary my mom's like that
too I was like maybe I should get lash
extensions I told her I wanted a very
natural like not too long and I just
wanted them to look like my own lashes
and they looked beautiful I didn't want
them long-term I already pretty much
have them all off except for like a few
like lingering I wanted them off right
when I got back because it is difficult
to do winged eyeliner overall I loved
having eyelash extensions only because
it was so easy to get ready you don't
need to do anything it just kind of
looks like you're ready already they're
not hard to take care of I will say that
as somebody who does YouTube videos it's
really hard to do dramatic makeup looks
while wearing them maybe it's just
because I'm not used to having high
lashes it's harder for me to do winged
liner so I wouldn't have them on a
normal basis because I do so much makeup
I film I take makeup off I film I take
makeup off and it's just not good for
your eyelashes if you do that with these
I've had individual lashes done in the
past and I didn't like them as much so I
think it definitely has to do with who
you go to I didn't have any eyelash fall
out with these other than my natural
lash fallout that you have your lashes
fall out naturally I didn't feel like I
was getting any bald spots I'm already
almost I almost have all of them already
I've been kind of low-key trying to get
them off so that I could film like a
more dramatic makeup look and I didn't
find that they took any of my eyelashes
off what else I did apply mascara every
now and then and they looked fine they
didn't fall out so all in all I would
say that my experience with eyelash
extensions is great but if you are
somebody who wears a lot of eye makeup
it may be a little difficult to maintain
them
so if you're somebody who doesn't wear a
lot of eye makeup and you just wear
mostly shadow they're great that's my
two cents on individual lashes and I'll
definitely link my friend who does them
down below because she is like the best
I think I'm done alright guys so that's
it for my favorites video I really hope
that you guys enjoyed it sorry I'm not
that great at favorites videos I'm
working on it
I'm working on describing things a
little bit better and just not rambling
so much well thank you guys so much for
watching that's about it I'm done
rambling I'll let you guys go now have a
nice day and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye
these are the sunglasses I wear when in
black and out the haters I can't my
brain is not connecting to my mouth
always the haters I don't see them
I suck at favorites videos I really do
there's a I think I had too much coffee
now just shake it off girls love
packaging my brain that was good
feels good both good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
