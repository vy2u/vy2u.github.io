for today's tutorial I will be doing my
foundation routine a lot of you guys may
think watching this video like dang
that's a lot of makeup that's because
it's a lot of makeup this is a glamorous
foundation routine it's for when you
have a night out a special occasion or
when you're planning on wearing a lot of
makeup like me if you guys are
interested in this full-on glam
foundation routine then keep on watching
first step is definitely priming your
face a lot of people skip this step
don't be lazy
prime your face it makes a huge
difference I used to be really lazy and
never do it but now I realized how
important it is to have a smooth base
I've been using the Make Up For Ever HD
primer and what I like about this one is
it's very thin so I like to put this all
over the face and it's a little bit more
moisturizing after I've applied that I
take my Tarte clean slate timeless
primer this one is a little bit of a
thicker consistency and I love this one
because it fills in all your pores and
all your imperfections and it just kind
of mattifies those areas where you tend
to get a little bit more oily so with
this primer I only put it in the center
of my face really focusing on the pore
area and doing patting motions when I
put it on cuz patting motions will
really really let it sink into like you
have any craters or large pores next is
my foundation and I've been loving the
Mac Studio Fix fluid this is an NC 40 I
love this because it's a medium to full
coverage foundation and I feel like it
lasts all night and just gives you the
most beautiful coverage and so what I
like to do is buff that into my skin
using a kabuki style brush something
that's like really dense and the reason
I like these type of brushes is because
you can really buff it into your skin
and initially when I put the foundation
on I do buffing motions but then as you
guys can see I like to really Pat it
into the areas where I have more pores
or I want to hide more imperfections so
that it gives me more coverage and this
brush is the zoeva silk finish 102 brush
so after I have a light layer of that
Studio Fix fluid foundation on I have
this little trick I like to do for
special events so I have been love
being the estee lauder double wear
foundation but it has a definite con
because it has really crazy flashback
with photography and when I was taking
photos putting this on my whole face I
would have liked white areas all right
here and I didn't like that so what I
like to do with this foundation is only
apply it in the t-zone of my skin
because this foundation is amazing for
oily skin if you guys are looking for a
foundation for oily skin I recommend
this if you're not going to do
photography but I figured that I love to
highlight these areas anyways so if I
got flash back it would look like I had
just really good highlight going on and
my skin is oil-free all night and the
foundation doesn't go anywhere so it's
beautiful so next is my concealer this
is the NARS creamy concealer in the
shade custard and what I like to do with
this concealer is place it right in the
inner corners to brighten these areas up
and any where I have like sunken in
areas I really focus it on there I don't
put a lot of concealer right under the
eye area right here because I don't want
it to crease more and get into the fine
lines so I like to kind of go around
those areas then I use a Beauty Blender
and I dampen it with my urban decay
setting spray because I feel like if you
use a setting spray it's definitely
going to make your concealer stay longer
and then whatever is left over I kind of
pull it up closer to these areas where I
have fine lines that way it's less
product less creasing immediately after
I put my concealer on I just quickly set
it with my Anastasia Beverly Hills
banana powder I love this powder because
it's brightening and it just kind of
brightens up the area and it sets my
concealer it makes it look really nice
and soft and for that I've been loving
this brush I got from Target it's from
ELF only three dollars you can't get a
better deal than that this brush is
amazing it's so soft and it just fits
perfectly under the eye area
sometimes I set my face with powder and
sometimes I don't it really just depends
but if I do I only like to set these
areas here with powder anywhere I get
oily that way the rest of my face keeps
a nice glowy look and for that I like to
use the hello flawless by benefit and
I'm the shade beige
to warm up my skin I love max give me
Sun you guys know this I like to think
of this as my transition shade for my
contour because this is a little bit
lighter than my contour but it's nice
and warm so it gives you that look like
you've been in the Sun and it gives your
contour a nice gradient so it's not just
a harsh line and then back to your
normal skin tone when you apply your
bronzer you really want to have the
number three in mind this is a trick
that a lot of makeup artists use you
kind of go along your face in the shape
of a three you really want to focus
under the jawline to sharpen that up
here in the contours and of course you
want to connect it to the hairline of
your forehead as well so that way it
kind of just flows through your face and
you don't just have a streak of bronzer
and then the rest of your face is a
little bit more pale I like to use the
Mac Studio Fix powder foundation this is
an NC 43 so it's a little bit darker
than my natural skin tone but just
enough to give me a really soft contour
along the nose and to deepen up this
area of the nose here because I like to
focus most of my contour around this
area just to narrow out the nose I like
to use the Anasazi color and the shade
fawn it's this one right here it's a
little bit more cool toned and not only
do I like to put the banana powder on
the under eye but I also like to apply
it on the bridge of my nose the center
of my forehead and a little bit on my
chin because you want the lights and
darks to balance on your face so all
these areas would also capture light so
that's why you don't want to keep just
your under eyes light without everything
else being light as well so I love to
bring that glow back into my face more
of a sparkly glow it's not too shimmery
it's just the perfect amount of shimmer
and this is City colors bronzer in the
shade sunset so with this product I like
to take a more fluffy brush something
that's not as dense just because I don't
want a lot of this product on my face I
just want to lightly sweep it across the
areas where we bronzed the skin so I
love to use the zoeva won 2-6 brush for
this and I just lightly Pat it in and
just run it across the cheeks and a
little bit above the arches of my
eyebrows so that captures a nice tan
glow as well so to contour my cheeks I
love to use these three shades I just
mix them and sometimes I just use one
you really don't need
but since they're there I just kind of
swirl a little bit in each of these I
will list the names of them exactly down
below in the description box but just
take a color that's a few shades darker
than your natural skin tone and I love
to apply contour just on this outer part
of the cheekbone here not past the eye
area I like to keep it just right in
this area right here for my highlight I
love to highlighters and I use them all
the time this one is a more recent love
this is by UA and it's called a tear
this is a cream highlight and I'm not
really a big cream highlight person but
I recently discovered it and I fell in
love what I like to do with this product
is just take a little bit on my fingers
and dab it on the highest points of my
face this gives you more of a glow from
within a more luminous look it's not so
much a sparkly look it just has a really
beautiful sheen so if I'm going for more
of a natural glow I will use just this
cream product but if I want people to
see my highlight from space which is
most of the time I'm going to also apply
my mary-lou manizer by the balm right on
top of that I like to also take this
highlight on the tip of my nose and on
the Cupid's bow so for blush I gravitate
towards every peach blush there is I
love peachy shades I feel like it really
brings a healthy glow to my face really
complements my skin tone and the one I
love is by Milani right now this one is
called Luminoso actually found out about
this one from nikkietutorials so I love
to just apply a little bit of this on
the apples of my cheek but more on the
outer apples not so much right here in
this area because this blush does have a
shimmer and shimmer will definitely make
poor stand out so you kind of want to
keep away from this area if you tend to
have more pores or anything like that
and if you do have a lot of pores and
you don't want to accentuate them I
definitely recommend a matte blush and
lastly I love this stuff
is the Urban Decay all nighter makeup
setting spray and I just like to give a
little spritz of this all over my face
so that my foundation does not go
anywhere all night setting spray also I
find brings out the highlights in your
face just makes them a little bit more
glowy so I really love to spray a little
bit extra in those areas as well alright
