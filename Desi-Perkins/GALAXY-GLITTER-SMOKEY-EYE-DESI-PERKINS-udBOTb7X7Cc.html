today's video is going to be a makeup
tutorial on this whole makeup look here
I was inspired by one of the newest ela
liquid metals this color in particular
that's all over my lid these are amazing
I love it so much and I'm really happy
with the way this makeup looked turned
out just because sometimes when you
envision something and then you try to
execute it it's like well that's
definitely not what I wanted to happen
but this time it was yeah I'm a little
chatty and rambley let's just go ahead
and get started we're gonna go into this
Zoe the block fusion palette really you
just need a cool tone light brown like
this one so anyone that you have in your
collection is fine with me we're just
going to use that on a morphe with no
number or name on the brush so blending
brush so I'm going to tell my head back
slightly so I can see the socket of my
eye and it's going to make it easier for
the placement of my shadow
I already primed my lids and set the
primer with a powder I'm going to start
right here in the center and just
lightly I'm barely even touching the
skin with this is if I mess up it'll be
easy to fix if it's not too heavy right
away and then I'm going to go ahead and
extend it out further over here
basically building our shape here and
using the lightest Brown to do so crazy
how this looks so cool toned in the
palette but on camera looks really warm
toned I don't mind but you know in
observation this eyelid I mentioned it
on snapchat this eyelids like all jazz
right here because I got scratched by a
cat when I was younger in the cat like
almost scratch my whole eyelid off right
here so that's also why I always do this
eyes I mean apart from me favoring this
side it's because of this I that I favor
this side fun fact I'm now terrified of
cats as well so next we're going to go
into my palette that's very well-loved
here this is my lorac Pro palette I'm
going to be taking sable and a little
expresso mixed together same brush they
go right into the crease and again
starting off light to make sure I get
the shape
I mean we already have the guideline but
I still like to be cautious so once I
feel confident with the shape then I
kind of go in like when shield wiper
motion
I like this color sable because it's a
really really dark rich brown and I also
like it because it's a neutral not super
warm or anything it's nice and deep so
we're going to go ahead and start
building up the crease we're doing a
really smoky eye today so this is a
really good alternative to a black eye
shadow if you don't want to use black
you could use this color it's just
really good we're going to continue to
work that into the crease and make sure
it's nice and blended I'm not going to
get back into my pallet for a minute and
so I feel like I've at least blended out
whatever I have here I'm sure you taper
out the ends don't worry if you get some
of this on your lid because we're going
to be putting on that Stila eyeshadow
and if you want you can cut the crease
with that eye shadow because it's really
opaque so if you get a little bit too
low like I did right
like here don't worry worry mostly about
the blending between these two shades
the brown that we put down and espresso
I'm actually just using ass press of
mill sable was not dark enough for me
I'm going to take a clean blending brush
here and just start to buff out the
edges this is a Smith 2:47 the reason
I'm taking a clean brush is because if
we start to use this other brush which
has the dark shade on it to blend out
the crease it's going to muddy the
colors that we put down it's going to
get into the brown and then you're not
going to have the nice gradient this is
melt cosmetics blur eyeshadow and what's
nice about this is that it's meant to
blur out any edges that you have in your
smoky eye so I put some of this on that
brush and then you could go over the
edges and it's going to soften
everything on make any mistakes go ahead
and blend them out with blur I love this
eye shadow I'm just going to keep going
back into espresso and deepening up my
eye shadow employ silicon where I need
it to be now I'll start with the fun
part I've been dying to use this
particular color and if you guys haven't
tried these they're so good i swatched a
bunch of them they are the Stila mess
in metals they are so nice I'm just
going to go in straight from the
applicator in my last video I used one
of these and I did it with a concealer
brush and I feel like it didn't look as
good so when I played around with them
again last night I realized that like
damn you gotta use it from the
applicator it looks so much better oh
this is so pretty nice about this is you
don't need an eyeshadow base you don't
need to set it once it dries it
literally just like drive I apply the
majority of it with the applicator and
then I go in with a tinier brush and
I'll clean up the edges and kind of
blend out the edges with the little
brush because it gets a little harder to
do once you get closer to the crease be
taking it on a little tiny Sigma smudge
brush I'm just chopping it I'm cleaning
up making sure it's like a nice straight
line across the crease so next I'm using
this Bobbi Brown liquid liner and this
is like the brown one I always use but
this is night sky Sparkle and it has
like a little bit of a purpley undertone
so we're going to make the line first
and then come back it's also nice that
these are like metallic they have a
little sparkle on them so I feel like it
looks really nice when you wear them
over shimmer like if I were to use a gel
liner it would be a lot harder for me to
apply over this really sparkly eye look
I just want to pick on the outer corner
I'm going to kind of keep it's in the
inner part of the eye the next I'm going
to use the better than sex waterproof
mascara by Too Faced
I have fallout all over my face but we
will clean that afterwards so the thing
about these feel that eyeshadows is that
if you try to blend around them after
they dry there will be like glitter
fallout so once it's a success not to
touch it but honestly this is why we're
doing our eye our face makeup afterwards
you could just clean it up with makeup
white so for lashes we're going to be
using a house of lashes iconic and these
are the regular iconic yes I've already
worn this pair so they're a lot easier
to apply kind of already molded to my
eyeball and I think a makeup wipe and
just clean up any of that fallout with
lots of glitter which is a pain
where nothing removes glitter are you
going to make up white but we'll try to
glitter in my hair to take a black liner
whether it's like a pencil or gel I'm
using the English L and make sure you
line your upper waterline that way your
lash line is extra dark especially with
the smokey eye and if you applied your
lashes a little off which sometimes
happened you don't want to see like gaps
of skin peeking through underneath so
this kind of just fills in all the gaps
makes it extra defined under there so
usually I like to do my face makeup
before I finish the eyes but I'm using a
closer more like focused lens right now
for the eye so I kind of just want to
finish them on the lens before I switch
over to the other lens long explanation
but I'm just going to go ahead and do
this concealer so that I could finish
off the eyes along here this is the
Becca luminous concealer in medium I
like to apply this concealer closest to
my under eye because it doesn't really
crease that much it's nice and hydrating
so if you have problems with dry under
eyes this is such a nice concealer for
that and we're going to smoke out the
lower lash line a lot anyway so it's
kind of pointing us to overwhelm that
skin under the eye with a lot of product
when you know it's going to be getting
covered up anyway for the under eye
we're going to do really really smoky to
top how smoky the top is I'm going to be
using this Marc Jacobs liner I'm just
going to say black but it probably has a
fancy name but that kid we're going to
go ahead and apply that oops I can't set
up vomit go pretty heavy with that
connecting it from the wing and then
just swoop it over here kind of one of
them blend that out before it dries
because I messed up a little bit and
blend it out I'm using dose of color
pencil brush you don't have to smoke out
your lower lash line as much but I want
to for this list I'm going to go back
into the brown that we used in the upper
crease the very first light brown
wherever here with the same pencil brush
and try to clean it off clean it off on
the back of my hand and I'm going to
just a graze that along I guess I make
sense like a count graze it along the
edge of the black liner that we've
smudged out
kind of soften the edge of that black
and also give it a nice gradient these
Marc Jacobs liners like from watching
them on my hand would not come off so
that well I'm hoping that they have just
as much staying power under the eye
because when you do a low set to the
scrunchie like this lower lash line you
don't want to be dripping or like
creasing or getting all gross I'm going
to top I mean you don't really have to
put mascara on your bottom lashes
doesn't really show too much because of
the black we have smushed under there
but it'll just hit it anyways make sure
everything's nice and blended because
the Tarte lights camera flashes we're
gonna move on to the face we move on to
the face makeup we're going to using
Giorgio Armani Foundation in 7.5 my
favorite at the moment we go ahead and
places we blend all this out with my
Beauty Blender
so now I'm using tart shape tape
consider it right that time right
heart-shaped a pan medium I'm using this
two more so highlight and definitely I
don't put this too close to my under
eyes because for me it's a little dry so
we do more of like a size of the nose to
slim it out in the hollows of the eyes
but not the under eyes because we ready
put concealer there make a straight line
down no bring it up into forehead that
way all our highlights are balanced out
over the face not just under eyes just
kind of brings dimension back into the
skin boom
Beauty Blender and blend that all out as
you can see I'm blending from the bottom
first and then blurring out that line so
that I have the least amount of product
close to my eye and that's just like my
skin preference some people can wear
shape tape like really close to their
under eye but I can not this is fact I
take the other side of the Beauty
Blender and just make sure to get all
the edges as well so that we don't have
just the white line we'll make sure that
everything is seamless they should make
like the luminous shaped cake so that if
you have drier skin you could wear it as
well that would be bone next we're going
to go ahead and set the under eyes using
Laura Mercier translucent powder I like
to start from the side of the nose first
that way most of the product goes here
to swim out the shadows of the nose and
then you want to bring the rest of it in
lightly so that you don't put too much
powder under the eyes and I'm not going
to put it anywhere near where I want to
apply my highlight either I feel like
the highlight goes better on straight
foundation and powdered skin most of the
powder starts at the sides of the nose
and then whatever is left over I also
bring it on to the apples of the cheek I
swear the translucent powder blurs out
like pores it makes them look softer I
don't want to put too much but I just
kind of pack on whatever is left over in
the cheek area next for my highlight I'm
going to use this Dior nude air
0:01 highlight this one is really pretty
I kind of feel like it's more subtle
than my
highlights and that's what I want right
now it's not super subtle but I don't
want to overdo my highlighting because
the eyes are so glittery I feel like I
kind of want them to feel the show and
then just have a nice bliss in to the
skin if you will just one the light hits
boom and I'm using a Smith to three to
actually learned from Patrick toss and
he was doing eye makeup he used a
smaller blending brush to apply
highlight because it gives you like a
nice control - right on top of the
cheekbone your skin just highlights in
that spot he also brought it like a C
across the forehead above the brow when
he was doing it to me I was like oh that
feels so strange to do that but then
when I practiced it on myself the other
day it looked really nice and natural
I'm gonna just going to take this motive
brush and apply a little highlight to
the tip of the nose for the inner corner
highlight I'll be taking the Alchemist
holographic palette by Kat Von D and I
want to do something fun so I'm going to
use blue sapphire and it looks like
nothing in the pan but really pretty
once we put it on oh this is exactly
what they look needed like just a pop of
blue crazy how beautiful these colors
are for inner corner highlight they're
so vibrant when you put them on I don't
know that okay so I kind of dusted my
brush off and I'm just going to blend
out those edges so that it looks like a
nice halo of smoke sorry I'm mirrors in
front of me doesn't have to get so close
to see what I'm doing I noticed that a
lot of times I like to play with makeup
but it's harder for me to experiment
when I feel like I have the pressure
filming like a tutorial with Steven
behind the camera like I feel like I
need to experiment with makeup before I
do the video sometimes or else when I do
the video is kind of like a flop so I'm
starting to do Instagram videos because
if I mess those up it's like fine and
it's not a big deal but I hope you guys
are liking them check them out on my
Instagram
home to this inner corner is giving it
to me so harder now next we're going to
go into bronzer I've recently started to
branch out in my bronzer department
because I've been using that give me
some for a long time but you know how
I've been telling you guys that my
breakouts have been primarily happening
on my contour line I got a brand new Mac
of me son because I thought maybe my
last one was just too old had it for a
hot minute
so switched it out still continued to
break out there even though I've never
had a problem with it before I'm just
kind of trying other things to see if
maybe something changed I don't know so
I hope that's not the case but anyways
I'm switching it I'm using the girl on
bronzer somebody correct me if I'm
saying that wrong which I'm probably am
and it's in the shade oh five and then
I'm using this brush which I don't know
if it's NARS or japonesque because I
know they both make brushes like this
and this has no name on it and I love it
so much and I always want to let you
guys know what it is so somebody could
please enlighten us as to which brand
this brushes that would be awesome I'm
taking this and just doing a light
bronze again I don't want too much going
on with the face because the eyes are
just the star of the show right now if
you do too much highlight too much
bronzer too much blush or something it
could just going to be too much going on
on the face so I'm just going to blend
this into the highlight and even blend
the highlight out a little bit more just
a nice strong you want to bring the
bronzer along the hairline lightly just
so that it all ties together I was so
inspired by this feeling liquid metal
and like it's such a refreshing feeling
to have your makeup come out exactly
what you envisioned I'm really happy
with it and I don't know if you guys
know how happy that makes me for my lip
liner I'm going to be using folks lip
liner by Mac nice and chewed up by
cannoli obviously I want the attention
on the eyes so we're going to go for a
nude lip surprise surprise for lipstick
I'm gonna use the Marc Jacob ears to try
now the last step just go ahead and set
your makeup with either a makeup setting
spray you tend to get oily or some fix
plus if you want to take away the
powdery look I didn't really use a lot
of powder but let's hit it anyway
because I'm high and it's refreshing
actually that is it for the makeup look
this is the finished look I love the way
this eye look turned out I love the
inner corner off I love these liquid
metals there's only like one I didn't
like which was the purple one I feel
like this this consistency was a little
bit different but the rest of them are
like magical unicorns honestly so let me
know if you guys have tried them if you
like them what you guys think of them
that's about everything love you guys
thank you for watching and I'll see you
in my next video bye bro show my wings
real quick get it to me cut everything
is so dirty I'm so embarrassed
oh really my mom she'll call me and tell
me to clean my makeup stuff hi mom hi
