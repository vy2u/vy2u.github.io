ready with me so I get to see you like
what you do I know you really love that

and we're just gonna kind of have a good
time drink some wine and everything will
be fine cheers to ourselves
yes that was a big mascara yes yes love
you love you too let me first explain my
vibe okay when I read I have to leave
the house at 8:00 in the morning out all
day I'm a mom I have to work and then
like I'll make your chickens I got to
take care of the chickens and I don't
want to look bad for them no you can't
no I can't
what I need is something light yes it's
easy to do that's not like clogging my
skin that I feel like I'm wearing it all
day I just like to keep something in a
you know the warm tones me too
I'm warm tones all the way I can tell I
feel like you and I have similar colors
skin correct is Eric like a little all
of you
a little olive E yeah so the bronze
really works for us because it feels
like were you alive in 1988 yes well if
they know you know do you know who
Bridget Hall is no I'm really bad with
names though she was a model and she was
in a Ralph Lauren campaign first of all
our guys look like she was like fresh
off of like this desert romantic trip
and that's not a family Sunkist
if you were just out in the Bahamas but
not burnt like Sunkist fresh yeah you
know like five flash flush in the best
way that's the good word for it flushed
so this is you wanna know viber oh yes
no I do I was only concerned with myself
but I all why are you that entry nozzle
okay yeah mm-hmm tell me about you my
it's also fresh glowy I can't interrupt
oh and I need a lash because needle add
I have to have a lash nimble as well
lots of highlight new foot same Oh same
a nude lip
alright so we're kind of on the same
page yeah you and I are very similar
yeah I you know I've always known we had
good vibes together I did - I did - I
can feel it by sitting next to you you
have a nice warm glow and it's not just
your makeup and you are so flushed I
just love it speaking of we're just
gonna start here oh wow is to first of
all have your own channel I should yeah
should I take this one you've got a lot
of balls this is my show now and I'm
gonna teach you how to do makeup ready
okay wake up your skin a little bit
get it primed and ready to go I also
wouldn't mind spraying a little rose
quartz spray we don't have that here so
instead of the rose quartz spray we'll
just take another set okay perfect
perfect I start with a brow this brow
pencil has the pencil on one side and
the brush on the other okay so show them
show them I'm gonna show all of them on
my lower concealer since I'm here I like
my eyebrows on the thicker side because
in my mind I'm Brooke Shields and
everyone is obsessed with me I need the
eyebrows to go with that so I actually
do it pretty light and I just kind of
like go over the whole thing and then I
take the brush and I brush it through so
it's not so solid so feathery strokes
some feathery strokes just to get the
same motion in the color as your actual
eyebrow I could definitely use some
tweezers but we'll talk about that later
we don't have those either so okay well
we'll put that on the list
I'm just priming my lids you know cuz I
have a really red lid so I have to just
neutralize why why do you have red lids
you're just born that way I don't know
I've never looked at my lid color I have
like a really red everything looks warm
tone to on me there we go
what do you think yours perfect now I
only get red just right here I get a
little red so I take this one and done
it's the easiest one alright
and I just put a little I already did my
skin but I just do a little boom boom I
mix it with a little lotion just to you
know give it an extra glow yep extra
glow and then I just pat pat pat I go
under the eye because I need to look
awake boom boom boom and the shape is
boom boom boom you're I'm a little
concerned am i right
I feel like you're actually gonna take
over my channel and people aren't gonna
want me there no I we already discussed
this Wow
I'm over this oh you know we forgot to
discuss though this new Hot Hot Heat yes
yes mirror I know that you were
wondering people are we holding and I'm
gonna tell you right now naked petit
heat because who doesn't want to be
naked and petite and hot right hello you
can case it's like the big heat and then
a petite one pocket size fits right in
your back pocket smaller than your
iPhone yeah everything's smaller than
iPhones these days that is also true
okay so I and I don't like a lot of
stuff on like my entire skin it looks
bad and I'm like a BB or something your
skin looks really like with radiant you
don't know what BB is BB 8 BB cream BB
cream yeah like you look like very fresh
Oh BB like oh now she's trying to
pretend like she knows oh yeah got it
okay yes since I was a BB can I see a
blush brush please yes you may
listen yeah I'm not that deep okay you
just duck duck Duck Duck
yep and then just a little boom and a
little boom you'd be surprised you get a
little color you know we are to like go
insane just a boom boom just a boom and
a boom boom possibly and then maybe an
extra boom but not too many
four booms the boo boo all the for booze
you're going too far yeah you're like
taking it to another place what I do not
have is an eyelash curler but I need one
not everybody does
and if you don't lucky you I don't know
what that's like
so you don't mascara before eyeshadow I
go mascara before eyeshadow Kay and then
I do a second coat
after the eye shadow oh really I was
gonna say to really just punch it in
yeah yeah PG version of what else can be
a version yes I'm just using these light
colors to just set my eyeshadow base
here and then I'm gonna go in with some
eye shadow I go eyeshadow before mascara
okay well different strokes for
different folks yes pun intended
with an eyeshadow brush I'll just go
here look vibrate hot spell Little Mix
oh you're going and all is that bold I
don't think it is look and then I just
go at the center uh-huh and then I just
like maybe move out a little if I'm
feeling sassy but not all the time
okay alright dun dun dun dun dun dun
start in the center and move up I hate
down strokes on my face but that's just
me nobody should set down strokes on
their face it's not good for your skin
no there's no down strokes allowed I'm
pushing and I'm just like moving up it's
very simple okay I have to ask you about
your chickens okay my family we all call
each other chicky chicken huge check
check yes when I call my mom I'm like
cheap cheap you know that's how we talk
to each other oh my god so I call
everybody watching my chickies I check

wild thing in my creature that's very
bold and I love that yeah wild thing is

down this might be for later in the day
maybe not so early but like you know
bring the heist down to the lower also

saucy you know you know doesn't it look
like I have a secret
yeah you look mischievious I feel like
who's the villain in Aladdin George are

I look like him I think no okay um okay
and then if you need a little more
coverage under the eye if it's been a
late night mm-hmm
obviously always which always yes except
for me cuz I go to bed except for Monday
through Sunday for you
mm-hmm I just go under the eye but I
didn't do that today because I'm well
rested you can but that's more of like
my chief cheeps know that you can put up
right you and I should do that for lips
oh my god girl you're you're moving
really fast right now I'm trying to
catch up you know why because like we
don't have time yeah and a little I
don't know anyway this is just like what
yeah I'm just gonna give you a little
look and I like feeling like I've just
been like a sly way okay I'm just trying
to catch up to you right now you are I'm
a demon probably film like 50 tutorials

should do it I'm just out here trying to
function

balm if I wanted to make it a little
more sheer boom are you done done you

make it rooms over here
should I go a little but look like I'm
loving I think we're gonna take it day
tonight now at this point okay great
then we're gonna go very fast taking it
day know start with before I go all the
way to ashes I'm gonna start with ember
just to give you another okay like what
I'm talking about now we're gonna start
building oh you thought I was golden
this morning no are you trying to go
you'll see me for dinner I'm still only
trying to come for you okay
I feel that but let's see how I feel
when I've got this liner happening okay
you uh you'd like to pull a lot of
pranks on your on your pops
I do you do you know I have the same
relationship with my brother you do
isn't it five cool
so many pranks on him he hates it but I
love it okay look all I did was I just
luck I just went boom boom boom boom
boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
that's a lot of booms but like look and
then you have it you have the shape you
know okay ready
let's count how many booms right this is
my eye okay this is the thing okay this
is my eye yes okay mm-hmm okay then
ready yep I hope somebody's counting how
many that was twelve boom twelve twelve
little booms and look I have to shape
and like that's really all you need is
that what you usually do for your wing
that's a little shadow right just like a
little shadow and more just for shape
it's a little bit more it's a little
easier and honestly if you start light
sexier it is it's sexier because it's
just giving you more of the illusion
yeah you know so this is like dinner
it's pulling your eye up it's pulling
your eye up and then if you really want
to get sassy what you do which I
obviously do then I'm gonna move into
ashes into the inner corner of my eye
which I haven't even touched this whole
time I'm actually hitting my lower
lashline with I'm going in with highest
and just smoking it out okay love that
that's actually a good thing to do when
you're really tired or you know your
under eyes are looking kind of suss one
day like you just really smoked the
lashline out low that's what I like to
do my thing okay what do you think I
mean should I leave should I go I really
and that's the vibe you know and that's
the vibe if you have a palette that's
all complimentary of each other which
you should if you own this then like
you're good to go it's easy basically
what you would call this palette in
three word boom boom boom calm down we
got it goin boom boom yeah all right
well I'm gonna put my lipstick on
because you've you know surpassed me
should I do a little do it or just
because well you're she's really getting
saucy no I mean I'm just
here I'm gonna go underneath because I'm
feeling very sassy look I don't know
what kind of night you're having if
you're putting someone over here oh my
all night yeah but like what is wrong
with a little sparkle under the eye
nothing there's never anything wrong
with sparkle there's really nothing I
just like a flush of color on the lips

you know and then oh you have the curler

trying to sabotage you mm-hmm I

be me yeah long and round and iridescent
multicolored all right are you long and
round and iridescent I think that's
those are the first things that come to
my mind when I think of myself but see
how the brush has different lengths of
bristles yes getting every single lash
like it's just putting it it's getting
you know 25 lashes right now I can feel
it yeah but yours look right look they
look thick and they look good uh-huh
boom boom all right let's hit it on the
lower boom boom what well you know you

your makeup but I think I beat you here
