today's video is gonna be not so much of
a tutorial but more like a get ready
with me chit chat let's hang out
together catch up with all the Halloween
videos I've kind of just been doing
voiceovers because I can't find it in
myself to be in the zone and also talk
to camera when I do those videos so it
was like let me dial it back and do more
of a casual video with you guys so
instead of just talking I thought I
would just get ready while I was talking
so I'm about to go head out to a movie
and I just wanted to get ready with you
guys so if you want to hang out with me
then keep on watching so I'm just using
a moisturizer first you know get that
plump eNOS going get a little moisture
this one is the dermelect rapid repair I
like to Pat and rub but mostly Pat
because I'm not trying to get like
wrinkles you know I don't like to like
go in and we're going to do a quick
prime this is the trust-fund beauty give
me food primer also primers Pat oh man
girl poor boy because you want them to
like really just get into those pores so
that when you put your foundation is
like for the under eyes I'll use a tiny
tiny bit of this clean slate timeless
primer this on the under eyes oh it's
not necessarily made for the under I
don't think but it's worked so well for
me to just kind of fill in those lines
so I'm just filling in my brows really
quick people always ask like what I do
with my brows to groom them I actually
do threading I love threading because it
kind of gives you like that really sharp
look and then also for me I'm really
sensitive to wax on my face the writing
doesn't make me break out as much if I
try to wax my face I just look crazy
after like I get really bad breakouts
it's just like a reaction that I have my
skin is so sensitive but I love the way
it starting looks I have the best girl
she's so good I always post her on my
snapchat if you guys follow me she makes
my like very sparse brows look not as
far somehow I don't know how she does it
go yes it makes such a difference when I
get my brows done because it's so much
easier for me to fill them in it's crazy
I was easy easy breezy beautiful color
through got this lip scrub in my Ipsy
glam bag this month and it's by Andy
Beauty I don't know why I'm only been
getting chapped here just here in here I
don't think I'm social just dip by for
my lips in there like that but I'm doing
anyway mm-hmm so it says that it's good
to prep your lips for like liquid
lipstick where will shall see we shall
see my friends all right now we're gonna
go in with foundation I have some
breakouts that are healing in these
areas they're a little bit patchy you
know when you put a lot of pimple cream
on because you're crazy like me so I'm
gonna use the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation it's not super match it's
more of like a satin finish so it's not
gonna accentuate my my situation I'm
gonna be using the carrot EF 26 brush I
hope this isn't too dark for me oh boy
this is a Tanner shade for me it's imma
take it down my neck this foundation is
just good for like normal dry and
combination so it's like a good
universal foundation I'm about to do my
loving tan tonight loving tan to our
Express that's where it's at if you want
to do a at-home tanning loving tan is
the best it's funny because I get so tan
like anyways naturally but the Lovington
gives me more of a golden vibe I feel
like there's like a lot we need to catch
up on because I've just been you know
doing Halloween videos and I don't
really get to chat with you guys as much
when I do Halloween videos mostly
because I can't talk to camera when I'm
doing them so I'm so focused I lose
track of what I'm doing
I got eyelash extensions today as you
can see they are everything to me when I
go on vacation because you just wake up
and you just have these lashes honestly
I don't like spending a lot of time
getting ready when I'm on vacation or in
a beautiful place because I want to
enjoy my time eyelash extension to just
make it so easy to do that I have got
top ones and I wanted them to be super
wispy and then I also got bottom ones
and I actually have little bottom lashes
now which I don't ever have I don't have
any bottom lashes at all
it's like just nothing down there so my
friend cami she does him I'll put her
information below she's everything like
she gave me exactly what I wanted and
she just hooked it up if you're somebody
who like doesn't want to fuss with eye
makeup and you're working every day and
you just kind of like want to get up and
be ready after just foundation and
concealer this is everything they're not
uncomfortable
I don't feel them at all I can't feel
anything I thought for sure the bottom
ones I was gonna feel a lot but I don't
really feel them at all
cami told me that bottom lashes don't
really last as long they kind of the top
ones last a lot longer since we just
wanted them for vacation she was like
yeah I totally try it it took about an
hour to do both top and bottom I'm
interested to see how it's gonna be
putting on concealer with the lower
lashes I'm using the NARS creamy
concealer I'm just putting a little bit
on right now because I'm in uncharted
waters oh girl I have so many dry
patches from all the pimple cream up and
Allisyn on my face sometimes you can
overdo it you know like too much dryness
I'm gonna seize the same brush yes it's
actually not that bad the brush kind of
goes like right underneath them
I already feel ready right now like this
is it I'm done give it to me I'm gonna
go ahead and set that with a little
Laura Mercier just a light swipe
sometimes I have like dirty brushes and
I play myself like I think I just did so
I'm about to prime my lids using the
Jessie's for eyeshadow primer I'm not
gonna do like crazy eyeshadow especially
because I just got my lash extensions I
just gonna do like a light slay I'm just
going to the movies so you know I just
wanted a flirty Oh another new thing I
also got new extensions so my hair is
really long now it have the short hair
but I wanted to do long hair for my trip
I'm going to Bora Bora I'm super excited
if you guys don't follow me on snap then
you don't know that but if you follow me
on snap then you know everything we're
all going to Bora Bora a whole bunch of
us I just decided I wanted to have this
long thottie hair okay one time just
bring back desi 2015 real quick so I'm
gonna go ahead and highlight my brow
bone and inner corner I'm going to use
the vintage vintage vintage by Jessica
liebe skin
and I'm picking up the shade of vanilla
cuz they're just gonna brighten up the
eyes it's gonna lift the brow bone area
just for a light highlight a light slay
if you will I'm basically all fake right
now I have fake eyelashes fake hair half
this eyebrow isn't even mine I'm
actually gonna use another color for my
inner corner highlight I'm just gonna
use this for my brow bone like my crease
anytime I'm not going to events I like
to do light slay makeup looks and it's
so funny because to me they're so like
simple and quick and a lot of you guys
always are like tutorial and I'm like
really I don't want you guys to get
bored with simple tutorials that's why I
decided to make this one more of like a
talk through chitchat more so than a
tutorial it's more like a hangout time
Babel came out to the Kylie palette yeah
the KY Cosmetics palette geez Oh give me
the Mario College I'm so excited for him
Mario is so sweet he did a palette with
a BH I'm just like so happy for him
because he's such a sweet person I I
just always have really loved him and
he's actually one of my favorite artists
he just mmm he's amazing this is his new
palette you obviously know these are my
colors these are my tones I'm in love
with these I'm gonna use Isabel
and I'm using a Smith - three - just
going to run this little crease I guess
there's not much I can say about my tape
and extensions yet because I have not
worn them long enough it's been two days
I'll keep you guys updated on snap as to
how they wear how I like them you guys
already know this is my shade right here
so you guys have to watch Katie's vlogs
I don't know if you guys have been
watching her blog she just started
uploading vlogs and it's like inspiring
me to start vlogging because she makes
it look a lot easier so she's inspiring
me to vlog I know that me and Steven
started our vlog Channel and we've been
wanting to vlog more and we just never
done it because I think we think they
have to be too extravagant and now I'm
like no they don't I would love to just
do more like weekly vlogs that are more
casual and then the the travel vlogs
will be more like extravagant and crazy
and stuff but yeah she's really
inspiring me to start vlogging more it's
it's so much fun when we vlog together
like it almost seems like we're not even
vlogging because of the way the camera
setup in the car you guys have
watch it I love watching them back to
you because it's just nice to have all
of your memories recorded and sometimes
it freaks me out how Katie and I just
like think and say the same things at
the same time and then when we see it on
video it freaks me out even more because
I think we don't realize it all the time
it's crazy so now I'm going to pick up
Kim and I'm just gonna apply that to the
lid and I'm gonna use this Coastal
Scents a shadow brush to pack it on so
it's just fun to see the vlogs I really
love watching hers I particularly like
them when I'm in them because I feel
like there are vlogs even though they're
her vlogs there are blogs that I don't
have to edit like she does it so it's
just great it's great for me but I think
Steven and I are going to start blogging
more it would be kind of cool I think to
see both perspectives since we're always
hanging out together but then you know
our perspective and her perspective I'm
excited I think once we get back from
Bora Bora we'll start trying to throw in
some blogs here and there what do you
guys think are you guys enter that Katie
and I would love to do a reality show
but we always talked about like we don't
want to really do like a like a drama
reality series you know we want to do
like do you guys remember the simple
life Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie and
they had to do all this crazy stuff and
travel to all these different places
like we want to do stuff like that like
where we maybe travel just have fun but
no drama that's just the one thing that
scares me about reality TV it's like
drama I'm an on drama zone I'm an on
drama banished sauna stresses me out
alright I'm gonna go back into Isabel on
my pencil brush from dose of colors and
I'm gonna run that on my lower lashline
I'm gonna try to get in my lower lash
line with these lashes I don't really
know how how do people do this oh I
thought that hard I'm so dramatic it's
not even that bad it's just like doing
it without the lashes I guess I did a
snapchat you could even call it a
snapchat tutorial the other day I'm
actually really bad at it I tried though
I don't know how people get all these
angles and apply mascara and put the
eyelashes on while holding the iPhone
and not looking in a mirror maybe I need
to set up a mirror I was trying to look
in the phone and put everything on it
was not as easy as a Shayla made it look
she doesn't like every morning I don't
know how she does it
he's a ninja I try I'm gonna try to get
better at you I'm gonna go ahead and
apply this inner corner highlight this
is the hot mama
from the balm cosmetics and I'm using
the same brush I'm just gonna put that
in my inner corner this has like a pinky
color but it's iridescent so I feel like
it's gonna look nice and the inner
corners and tie in with the other warm
shades that we used yeah that's what I'm
looking for I wanted to say to you guys
thank you so much for all the support
that you showed on my school video
melting school video just like took all
of us by surprise and filming it was
like not as easy as it looked in the
editing because I had that idea day uh
we were actually supposed to go to an
event Stephen and I that day and I
remember telling him you know what I
can't go to the event because I have an
idea
and I want to do this idea like it's
fresh in my mind
we just did it but usually I try to
practice more or like really solidify
the idea in my head before I do it in
this case I was kind of doing it on the
fly worst case scenario we try to film
it it doesn't look good then we do it
again we were up till no joke 4:30 in
the morning possibly five filming that
video um and Stephen I think magic but
it was so worth it like it's so cool
when it's just like you put so much
effort into something when you have that
spark of creativity and it just like
turns into everything that you thought
it would I was really really excited
that you guys loved it so much it was
just one of those things where I was
like I didn't think that you guys were
gonna think it was that cool mostly
because it was a skull and you know
there's so many skulls so I just really
meant a lot that you guys all really
loved it and I feel like lately I really
do feel like lately my creativity has
like come back a little bit ever since
the Selena video I have felt so inspired
again like I I think like as an artist
anybody goes through a rut and you just
kind of I don't know you feel dry for a
little bit and that's kind of how it was
feeling and then once I started doing
the Selena video and then the Halloween
videos I just felt this like extreme
passion that I haven't felt in like a
hot minute like
obviously I still love doing makeup but
then there's like this you love it and
then there's like oh my god I could live
eat breathe sleep poop makeup right now
so I really meant a lot thank you guys
it just made me want to keep like
getting better and doing better and
doing more cool things and I just he
caught us all oh my gosh and you know
what's so cool is that so many of you
guys recreated it and when I posted the
using the wrong brushes here when I
posted the photo initially I think
people thought it was like really hard
to do
I'm just powdering my face with some
hello flawless I think you guys thought
it was like really hard to do because it
does look super intricate but when so
many people recreate something it means
that it wasn't as difficult as it looks
it just has a really cool effect and
yeah the skull part is really hard but
the dripping part like wasn't as crazy
hard as it looked I guess and when I see
so many people doing it I feel like kind
of excited because I'm like oh either
I'm a good teacher you know I kind of
get excited that I was like a good
teacher
I hope that's why everyone can do it and
you guys are talented AF but you know I
did go to college to be a teacher so
when I see that it's almost like oh
maybe like maybe I'm a good teacher
sometimes you know I was proud basically
as what I'm saying I was really excited
obviously I'm using giving me son duh
duh you guys know this honestly like a
kind of came full circle because I
started loving makeup through Halloween
so it's just nice to get my spark back
through doing that type of makeup I'm
just gonna put a little across my nose
I'm gonna go in with my trusty gilded
honey highlight sometimes the
highlighter really like shows that this
part of my lip goes down a little bit
lower than this one okay what do you do
highlighter just brings life to your
face I think I want to do like a baby
wing a little baby wing so I'm just
gonna do this I'm going to use the Kat
Von D tattoo liner and trooper this is
like my first time trying this with
lashes that's why I'm going to just do
the outer corner because I'm kind of
like intimidated right now I'm not used
to having lash
you know I wonder if that's why it's
like harder for people to do liner when
they have like a lot of eyelashes in
their way oh yeah okay we're gonna work
on that you work on that
okay go a little bit further huh
okay all right just add like a little
lift to the eye you know what was really
good about doing the skull video like I
really enjoyed the fact that I only had
to do full glam on one eye even though
the other side was so much more
intricate it's so nice not having to
match one side of your face liner to the
other side because that liner was pretty
like thick and I didn't have to match it
to the other side cuz it was a skull I
was so happy about that I'm just over
here trying to figure out more Halloween
ideas where I only have to do one side
of my face that high school challenge
would take me two seconds because I
think all I did was liner I have to look
back at more photos but I'm pretty sure
I was like liner mascara and you
couldn't even see the mascara because I
didn't have no lashes I didn't wear
bronzer big mistake just blush no
highlighter I don't even think I don't
think highlighter was this big of a
thing and I'm not even too sure if I
filled in my eyebrows all that great I
think when I look at my picture my
freshman year picture you can't even
really see my eyebrows one of my friends
back then she was like really good at
makeup she would do my makeup moment
club and I would always beg her like
please do my makeup please do it and she
would just give me the best mochi I ever
so I didn't even actually do that myself
it wasn't until like senior year that I
got more into it alright so I'm gonna
use peaches blush and this one is by MAC
Cosmetics this was actually one of my
high school blushes like actually I
think it was peachy keen mmm that was my
jam
I'm kind of just um putting the blush
all over I'm going for a more natural
makeup look I'm gonna have a wing but
you know like a more natural skin I
don't want to look too heavy this is
nowhere near natural but natural
alright for my lip color I'm going to go
with like a mocha shade because that's
not something I usually do this one is
Cosmo holic and it's the shade of
mysterious mocha
oh I was checking to see if my teeth
look whiter
I've been whitening them I like to use
Crest Whitestrips gentle though because
my teeth are super sensitive if I use
the normal ones I'll regret it you want
to try this yeah I'll put some Tasha
cleansing oil it's going to make you
more masculine oh yes I knew that yeah
it's gonna require Rico this is the
chamomile cleansing oil by tatcha this
is actually to wash his face but he
wanted to try it look at your skin
you're absolutely glowing and just like
that I feel 100% out of here bro
so that's it thank you for getting ready
with me catching up chit chatting I'll
see you guys in my next video ba ba am I
making any sense tell me I am he'll edit
it to make me make sense
