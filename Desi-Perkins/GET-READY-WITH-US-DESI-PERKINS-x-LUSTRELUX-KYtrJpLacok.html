up in here
good then what that socket one time one
sample is the National Woman's Day and
happy national ones taken up happening
so we just filmed a video on Katie's
Channel

think we killed it
John didn't give me very many options so
you guys have to go watch it down you're
like already making so many moves I just
feel like I don't have that much time
really we don't have time but this is I
know slow regardless of how much time -

you imagine eyebrows on all day from the
last video are you going to do my
brushes off though oh there's Beauty
butters and they're wrong better not
though oh fuck you better not though
already ate one of my beauty blenders I
can't you have that again this is the
Elan so the one she ate when we put it
in here that's disrespectful and the
more sensitive cannoli look of the enemy
eat them all the time I'm so fat every
time they look at you in the eyes and
they did yeah all right I'm going into
which ones americano broken Haslam
broken ass americano dark brown it's
almost like a it has like a burgundy
undertone yes it does feel like it or
not eat it no I like it because it's
like not warm brown you know it's like a
different Brown it's a cool bad no snow
I can't do anything girls references

crocheted but I'm not a crocheted you
for a fancy if you want equal wear is
like ripped up denim I'm still waiting
on your video what video

feel like I need to be a little bit more
carefree with my makeup like I'm too
perfectionist like I spent you long on
one thing and that's what fun me up I
know what you're saying you know what
I'm saying so I'm going in with a deeper
shade now I want to do a really fierce
wing but I've been having one
returnables yeah I've been having like
struggles lately it didn't look like
you're having a wing struggle earlier
one of these days I would have me do my
weave I can't doing too much for me you
can do you do all the time what are you
going to do something for me like my
boys you know we're all the times of
Chania bees for you or warn bees for you
is true I knew you're going to say that
yeah I wanted to take it back the minute
you do that I can't know that I couldn't
I was like holding on yeah you're hoping
I would forget I don't you never forget
I don't forget anything ever again I'm
not feeling good about the milk segment
today I'm not either actually a little
ambitious it's too frosty for what I
want you like it more like like way to
pop on the center you know I might still
hit it like a little pop I don't know I
feel like I'm not me that's not the
church I'm going in any more video I'm
just going to take pictures II can I say
something yeah you got some song in my
peach smoothie which is kind of a
problem for me
there's fallen debris in my future oh
I'm just going with what I know you're
because I you're just going in yeah I
wish we had more bowls yeah well we
don't we don't were weak we are weak we
are weak humans
still like over here my grace you know
doing what I do what are you doing like
on your lid tinkle right Kate with a car
really quick see what happened to try to
clean it up a little bit get that car
roll I don't want to do this after I
said it stupid
I thought that was a shadows like we
gonna look so good now I'm just gonna
clean it up it just makes it look like
sharp clean took a little Mac soft ochre
eyeshadow base on a concealer brush and
you just kind of go in and clean it up I
mean you got so long put your natural
home now I mean use natural things this
heart-shaped a central know Katie's
really good at smoking out her outer be
yes that's not really where I live
you're good at carving though I see it
carves to save my life in a car you're
just putting eyeshadow base on again you
know but my shit will fold over so hard
my additional eyelid I have like three
eyelids noon anyway you don't have that
you like the crisp yes I got scratched
here when I was little by a cat like
almost my whole eyelid in this section
it like folds and I have a scar right
here it's like on this side I had to lay
in bed for a week with medicine just in
my eyelid yeah
so now I'm terrified a fucking cat feel
like I have the right to be you know I
was younger like this skateboard thing
that you can sit on and I was on like a
really long driveway I had like
handlebars and I was like going down
this really long curved driveway and I
fell off and I split on my face
like oh my like half my remain missing
oh my god it was so it was like a huge
part of my face missing and I had to put
like Nutella jelly on yeah people made
funny so those like boogers I remember
that that's what happened to me how all
brothers named Expedia I like that
moving on I'm moving on
you don't wonder what you're losing what
duraline without it not be able to wear
anything jump any eyeliner
ever again did do using your brows of -
I put in my Cobra duraline is the shit
you guys it's just like rehydrates your
gel products I haven't committed to a
wing
I'm already what do you think what's
going on over here keep my eye on the
Jurchen or do I need to really hit
I like the tones would you lie to me and
tell me that you liked it even if you
didn't maybe at this point you boys home
yeah
because there's no going back for me
wish I hear how she does my lip space
well like a rose gold I think I want to
do something matte and then like what do
you think about matte look like a little
shimmer in the center just like a little
moon all right I'm gonna I'll be back
were you doing let me see if I can get
one of those Stila Islands
she left me I'll just be here by myself
some in my butt I'm curdling things are
going back for me
I'm losing track of what's happening now
you know I tried earlier I tried to fill
out a chunk of lash food and I pulled
out too much oh it was like a really sad
moment like really remember it there too
- like girthy lashes I'm no I'm just
shoving you know liner in there mm-hmm
filling the gap yeah still in we do
hungary's where you're moving really
quickly it's kind of stressing me out a
little bit it's usually how it works is
it which is weird cuz I'm really slow
imagine if you did it get ready with
Shayla okay I wouldn't be able to you
would be able to before I was done with
brow yeah she be dealt her whole face
she does her makeup in like 30 minutes
two seconds she's out the door she's
done okay I think we're doing I think
we're okay now be sure he came through I
understand it was some I just like
really meshed everything together with
some song mmm
like a light blend wash a light wash
okayed it with some fun so I have no
idea what I'm wearing tonight I'm going
to we're going to Bouldin Barbie and
Sophia Ricci are releasing some denim so
we're going to their party I think a
wing will come through for me or it
could ruin my life it could destroy me I
knew would come through for you I think
I need something like I need something
with you come through for me but it
could also destroy me we're going to go
for it what do you use what what brush
to use for liner honey cash upon every
reason you feel about it you sharp I
like it judging it oh my god I have
paper towels right here she's just wiped
it on her pant honestly nuts I these are
my these are make the pants you love
liner
their makeup pants what I do and you do
this we use it for a wing as well
eyelashes oh no where's Riley my little
scooter when I go back all right guys
this wing could either take us there she
could be really heavy or she'll be
crying in the potty in love
fifteen minutes so - I think we oughta

it's really are you born
no are we boring overnight I guess a lot
of stuff we're gonna study Thunder eyes
before me to happen if you had to wear
one foundation for the rest of your life

fell under my eyes this is not a game I
don't know what happened yet yeah I see
it
it's either waterproof mascara or
England would you go about it
differently if you knew it was no
because you know what you want to know
what I know what my by by under I was
very creamy mm-hmm so it's this isn't
going to dry it's not like something
that's minimal you noticing what I might
do I might touch it with a q-tip just to
see what's going on mm-hmm I probably
just take fucking a dot of makeup
remover how does it it's not something I
want to do no nobody wants to do that
that's risky
you care I know I should know I'm
stressed she's just on real stressed for
