there are so many new beauty trends and
gorgeous the love looks coming from both
the media and the runway it's sometimes
hard to keep up but now I'm making it
easy because this is get the lung
hi guys I'm back with another tutorial
and today it's actually going to be a
hair tutorial a lot of you guys here on
YouTube and Instagram have been
commenting and asking me to do tutorial
this for you it's pretty much my go-to
hairstyle I love it because it's relaxed
it's easy and it looks great on second
day so yeah I'm gonna do it for you guys
and what really inspired me actually was
JLo on the cover of InStyle I don't know
if you guys saw the cover but she looks
gorgeous I'll put a link here in the
description box below so you guys can
see the inspiration for this hairstyle
but um yeah I loved it and I just
thought I'm gonna sit down I'm gonna
film this for you guys my hair is
actually really frizzy and unpredictably
wavy so I mean if I just let it air dry
I don't know what's gonna happen it
could be like okay it could be not so
bad it could be just lion king status so
it's really important to know how to
smooth out your hair with a blow-dryer
and I decided to show you guys how I do
my hair from beginning to end blow-dry
and curling so I hope you guys enjoy
this video I think that's it let's start
start off by combing through your damp
hair to make sure it's tangle free these
two attachments come with my blow-dryer
but I'm gonna opt for this one to give a
smooth finish make sure you have two
clips to section off the hair I like to
start off with the bottom half of my
hair and I also like to use a round
brush here I'm using my kiss blow-dryer
and I'm just gonna go ahead and brush
through the hair focusing mainly on the
ends I really like this blow dryer
because as you guys can see its handle
this so it makes it a lot easier for me
to maneuver and it also makes it a lot
lighter I'm a little bit more relaxed on
how I blow-dry the bottom half of my
hair because let's face it nobody sees
that part
so now that we got to the top part I'm
going to show you guys my technique
which is basically pulling the hair
forward and holding the blow-dryer right
on to the brush as I spin it make sure
you get the roots so that you have a
nice lift and I like to rotate the brush
inwards and outwards I feel like it
gives your hair a bouncier finish it's
really important for me to have this
attachment at the end of the blow-dryer
because it controls the air and what
direction it goes in whereas if you
don't have it the air blows just all
over the place now it's time to do the
top of my hair and of course this is the
part where I spend the most time because
I want it to look the best and my banks
especially I really really spend a lot
of time on them I just want them to
cooperate with me from time to time
considering I also have that cowlick
that I have makes my hair go all over
the place but anyways I'm gonna start
blow drying and I'm gonna go inwards
first with the brush and just keep doing
that over and over again and then after
I've gone inwards a couple of times I
also like to take the brush and go
outwards and voila
so now the bangs are tamed now I'm just
going to go ahead and section off these
last few pieces that I have left and
blow-dry them using the same techniques
that I've been using throughout the
video and once you're done with that
last strand of hair you have a fabulous
blowout no need to go to the salon now
I'm going to use my tapered wand and
this is also by kiss section off your
hair and then start curling I'm wrapping
the hair around the barrel very loosely
because I want a relaxed wave and as you
can see here I just pulled the hair
under the wand and towards my face hold
it for about I don't know 5 to 10
seconds and then I cup it in my hand to
let it cool and you have a beautiful
bouncy wave I'm just going to continue
this process throughout my whole head I
think the trick to this hairstyle is
knowing that all the curls have to be
curled in the same direction so that
when you brush them out it gives you a
really soft s wave-like effect so that
would be the secret in my opinion
so once we've completed all of our curls
you can leave them like this if you want
however I like to brush them out using
the same brush that I blow-dried my hair
with and the reason I do that is because
I want more of a soft wave I want it to
look more effortless I guess you could
say I think J Lo's hair is definitely
very effortless on the cover so don't be
afraid to brush those curls out alright
guys I hope you enjoyed that hair
