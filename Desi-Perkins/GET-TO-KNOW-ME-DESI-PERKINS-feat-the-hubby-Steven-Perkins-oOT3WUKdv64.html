welcome to my get to know me video mmm
today I mess up my nose contour I asked
you guys on Instagram what kind of
questions you wanted me to answer so I'm
pretty much just gonna go through the
comments right now and answer as many as
I can name one of your favorite B
grooves
I think Tanya burr was the first YouTube
guru that I started watching so I love
her I love love love nikkietutorials
she's so she's bomb she is amazing
she's like a true artist and that's what
I love about her she's she really knows
makeup and that's why I love watching
her videos and she's funny as who taught
you to edit your videos I use Final Cut
Pro and who taught me to edit well when
I first started my youtube channel
um I sat down and my husband was just
like here's Final Cut and here's how to
cut clips and drag them and put them
together but that was it he basically
taught me like the basic tools to edit
and then I kind of just started googling
and youtubing and anytime I had
questions and he was home I'd ask him to
help me figure it out and I kind of just
gradually learned that way so I guess my
husband taught but they want to know how
we keep such a happy marriage I'd say we
keep our happy marriage by spending lots
of time together just being each other's
best friend trusting each other and she
makes me sandwiches for lunch
can I do noon it's a good recipe for a
good marriage
can you post more of your wedding if you
YouTube Perkins wedding I'm pretty sure

wedding video it's like a short
three-minute video so if you wanna if
you want to watch it then how old are
you why do you guys want to know I know
I'm not old but alright I'm 27 I think
my mom even forgot how old I would my
own mother how tall are you and what's
your weight

last time I weighed myself I think it
was like 115 what is your ethnicity I am
Spanish and Mexican what's your favorite
drugstore liquid liner that's easy NYC
that one is the ball if you were caught
in a fire and could save something what
would it be if I was caught afire I
would save my computer's because they
have all of my pictures on them like one
thing that I couldn't get back
everything else I don't really care
about I mean I'm assuming my husband is
already like out the door with me so if
he wasn't I guess I would save him oh I
would save my dog so is there a plane
with the heck do you have any siblings I
have three brothers I have a 31 year old
brother a 21 year old brother and a 20
year old brother my brothers are
hilarious and they're my best friends
and they just they made me tough you

cereal have you thought about trying to
pursue a singing career I love singing
as a hobby and for fun but I don't think
I don't think I'm cut out to be a singer
what was your occupation prior to doing
makeup I was a server and did you get a
college degree
yes edge weighted to be an elementary
school teacher because I love kids so
much how did you get over a terrible
breakup I'd cry and then I eat and then
I'd go out with my friends and remember
that I'm fabulous I would my head back

know you're part Mexican could you speak
a little Spanish for us
si soy mexicana give us aa no ii must be
see porque no hablo espanol fantome tea

whoo my armpit looks
what is the making of your tattoo
whatever I do in life as long as I'm
creating I'm happy and that truly is
what makes me happy I'm doing what I
love and so doesn't that mean how do you
balance your relationship with work and
everything else well um I know some of
you guys know it but a lot of the times
my husband helps me with my work so we
work a lot together am i having kids I
get this question so much and when are
you guys having babies this question I
really struggled to figure out whether
I'd answer it or not and at the end of
the day it's a big part of who I am now
here we go last summer all I wanted was
to have a baby it was just like the one
thing on my mind I love kids so much and
so my husband and I started trying and
we got pregnant and it was like the most
amazing exciting thing ever
and of course we told like our whole
family and our friends and we were just
so excited and it turned out that I had
complications and so we lost the baby
and it was really sorry um it was hard
because I didn't expect it to happen and
on top of it I had to have surgery
because they said I had a tumor and that
I could have like cancerous cells and so
based on my lab result after the surgery
they would see if I needed chemo or not
and it was really difficult because not
only did we lose the baby but then they
said I'd had to possibly have chemo and
then um
of course I had to get tested every week
for a long time and it sorry
it was it was really hard um and I
totally completely stopped instagramming
and um of course I did you know I had no
passion to do anything it was it was
terrible I I was actually just in bed
every day because I couldn't handle it I
had posted something on Instagram saying
that I was going through a hard time and
I didn't want to say what it was because
it was so hard for me obviously it's
still hard for me to talk about but I
got so many emails from you guys telling
me about things that happen in your life
and all of these emails changed
everything about the way I felt I got an
email from a fan saying that they lost
their mom and their sister in the same
month and it really broke my heart and I
just I got so much support from
everybody and nobody even knew what was
happening they just knew that I wasn't
feeling well and I can't tell you guys
how much that changed my life and my
journey because after all these emails I
got up I got out of bed and I was like
I'm just going to continue to do makeup
and I'm gonna work really hard and I'm
going to work every day I got out of
this funk instantly like three months
later all of these big things started
happening for me because everything
happens for a reason when it's meant to
happen it'll happen I mean sorry now
that I got all emotional you weren't
doing makeup what would you be doing I
think maybe I would try to start my own
clothing line and you know maybe I'll
still do that now because I love fashion
and yeah probably something along those
lines
see customer and I love their bags what
do you do a tipsy so you guys know I'm
making youtube videos and I have my
channel and I work for MC as one of
their stylist I also work with crispy so
if you guys don't follow her you should
because she is the ish and she's amazing
at makeup she inspires me all the time
because she's so good I'll put her link
down below we help each other or film
videos a lot of people say that our
videos are similar and I guess that's
true because we feed off of each other's
energy and we bounce ideas off of each
other and I don't know you know when you
become really good friends with somebody
and you just start to kind of be very
similar to them and I think that's
what's happening and it's just
translating into our videos where bits
I think somebody asked once if we had
the same editor no one edits our videos
but us zodiac sign I'm a Pisces guys so
I hope you enjoyed my get to know me
video and that you aren't asleep um but
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and for your support with all
my videos it means the world to me and
I'm so blessed and I will never forget
it and yeah so thank you guys for
watching once again and I'll see you my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
