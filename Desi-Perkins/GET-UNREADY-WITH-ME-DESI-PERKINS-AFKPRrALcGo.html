welcome back to my channel so tonight I
thought it'd be the perfect time to do a
get unready with me video I've seen a
lot of people do this and I'm like let's
do it
this is like the hardest makeup to get
off other than perhaps glitter I have a
black smoky eye with so much eyeliner on
top of eyeliner my base for this eyes
Inglot gel liner and that stuff is
honestly probably the hardest thing to
remove I'm going to be doing it getting
ready with me showing you guys
everything I do when I get home from
taking off my makeup to laying my little
head down on the piano so let's go ahead
and get started first things first I
usually would remove my hair extensions
but since I don't have any in right now
we're good second most important thing
eyelashes you got to just remove those
put them in a not so safe spot because
that's what I do now what you want to do
is remove your makeup I use the Clinique
take the day off when it's a serious
situation like this it's a little messy
but it's just it gets everything off I
feel like I can see light now that I
took those eyelashes off they were like
giving my eyes shade that's how sick
they were I'm going to scoop using not
my nail but like the back of my Alma
take like a glob of this out we got some
of that on our hands this is a bomb that
turns into oil type situation once you
put it on your face so I rub it around
oh this is going to be so sexy yes we
are going to make moves here very
quickly and I'm lightly with no extreme
pressure just circular motions I'm going
to see what's going on right now no no
no this is like artwork I know what
you're talking about what you want to do
is just spread it all around get it
everywhere remove everything I always
love looking at myself once I do this so
now that I've broken down most of the
makeup with the balm I like to take my
makeup wipes and these are from Costco
best wipes in my opinion best deal and I
lightly start to work all the product
off oh my God look how much lighter my
face glow so you don't want to rub with
a makeup wipe too harshly around your
eye area very delicate skin so just want
to make sure
wiping all of the makeup away from my
face
also don't forget under the chin area up
Senate that pretty much got everything
off with the exception of like a little
eye makeup which I'm going to let slide
right now because we haven't washed our
face yet I get everything off as much as
I can and then I'm going to go ahead and
cleanse my skin this is the Juice Beauty
stem cellular cellular cleansing oil I
kind of just dampen my fingertips and
add two pumps of this cleanser and then
we're going to really work it into the
skin and this stuff works so good at
breaking down any makeup if there is any
lift I don't really like rub really
closely to my eye so there may still be
a little I makeup left but we'll fix
that later it just breaks down any
leftover foundation melts it away and it
leaves your skin baby soft I had some
extractions recently so I have a few
little scabs because there are healing
right now I'm in a healing phase and one
space she looks really nice because
everything gets super smooth and all
your clogged pores are gone
taking my charlotte tilbury washcloth
this is so sweet
they just set this over and dip it into
some hot water and just do it Spa style
right so you can see that even after you
know using a makeup wipe and that other
stuff the Clinique bomb there's still
like some going on okay it's really
hard to get all that makeup off if you
just use a wipe and you sleep like that
there's a lot of stuff left over on your
face then a clog your pores and you're
in a breakout and if you just use a face
wash without a makeup wipe or something
to break it down it's still going to
leave a little bit of makeup you just
know how to make sure you get it all
done I'm in my blush room that my dad
got me it's like all I ever asked for
for Christmas or anything so just get me
a robe and I'll be so happy I actually
asked my mom for some white bath towels
this year you know she gave me that
they're in the mail situation still
waiting mom still waiting all right Wiki
cleans so this is what I like to do next
pick up some of my eye makeup remover
and this is from Neutrogena I always
have to make sure to remove any leftover
liar I cannot stand having like leftover
residual liner or any type of makeup
around my eyes because when you wake up
in the morning
yourself you're just like I what
happened to me so I just did one q-tip
into my Neutrogena oil-free eye makeup
remover like so little q-tip I'm not
really rubbing I'm just lightly grazing
if you will under the eye and also on
the lash line and when you wash your
face it's really hard to get in that
area right so I think I remember all my
makeup when I only clean under my eye
but then when I blink there's like just
more black stuff's coming down so it's
usually from the upper waterline gotta
get rid of it
this really breaks down waterproof
mascara also removes lash glue from your
lashes which is great I have to make
sure that I have no mascara left over
all my lashes because of the lash serum
I use which I will also show you guys to
be honest with you my night cherishing
is just like incredibly exhausting I
tell Steven every night I'm just like
you know what it's like to have to put
on all these products I'm aware that
it's a long process that's why it's
always so great when I'm not wearing a
lot of makeup because the process time
is like cut in half now I'm just kind of
making sure to Pat away any of that
excess makeup remember so now that my
face is washed all the makeup is gone
I'm going to use my SK - a facial
treatment essence this is a skin
balancing essence water those are bright
and help with texture those to help with
wrinkles and what you do is you just
take like four drops of it and hide it
into your skin also Pat it down on it
and to be honest a little on my hand as
well whatever's like left over and the
next of course you want to moisturize
I've been trying out this new one so
this is what's in my bag right now this
is the touch of the water cream this is
a super hydrating cream it's actually
more of like a gel type formula so it
works really good for oily skin it
doesn't feel super greasy or heavy it's
like very strange once you apply it to
your skin it just feels like little
water molecules are just bursting all
over your face I'm just going to go
ahead and apply a little bit of that
yeah oh I really like the way it makes
my skin feel I have a little bougie ass
boom to that you used to like scoop the
product out so that you don't put your
fingers in the product and contaminate
it okay next you're going to go ahead
and put on eye cream ice creams very
important I never skip this I promise
you I never skip this I've been using
the lemare the illuminating eye
I'll actually stole this from you
Stephen this was actually given to
Stephen and I saw on my calendar one day
and I was like I've been using it ever
since I don't even think he uses it now
I use it nice because it's a gel and gel
formulas are really good for my
under-eye because a lot of times if I
use really heavy eye creams I get the
mini a little like skin tag so gel works
really well and I'm using the ring
finger to Pat it into the under eye the
reason I use my ring finger is because
this finger has release muscle control
out of all your fingers so it has the
lightest pressure that you could put on
your under eyes you don't want to like
really really you know rub it in like
that so that means less wrinkled now
this I'm not going to lie I do it
sometimes sometimes I know it depends on
how tired I am I'll apply my Juice
Beauty stem cellular lifting neck cream
because I don't need to lift my neck
quite yet but I don't want to have to
lift it you know what I mean I want to
prevent the list I mean regardless you
should be applying all of your skin care
on your neck just pretend it's a part of
your face you don't have to have a neck
cream to actually just use your normal
skin care and take it down your neck
because your neck will always give away
your age and that's a fact
right you could do like a lot of stuff
to your face I mean I'm sure you can do
things to your neck as well but I mean
can you can you do things your neck I'm
gonna have to look into that think about
it for my skincare I usually apply some
lip balm this is the Tasha lip balm it
has a gold leaf in it which is super
boosh makes me feel sometimes boys I
just take a little bit of that and put
it on my lips I'm going to lips get
really dry at night especially if you
have like the heater or the air
conditioning on tends to dry out your
skin a little bit more so this
protective layer just get too nice and
moist Ridge that way when you wake up
like your lips look plump everything
looks plump you don't live off dry it up
and then the last thing I do which is
like an extra step to my routine but it
has been so worth it lately as I started
using Latisse l'tesia basis Latif Latif
is based home like can you guys tell I'm
ready to go to bed so the piece is
basically an eye lash growth
theorem that helps grow your lashes nice
and long it doesn't make sense picker it
just makes them grow longer and I've had
the tiniest tiniest lashes for my entire
life that no amount of mascara would
ever make them show up finally I gave in
a trial atif I've heard like good things
and I've heard bad things about Latif
I've heard that it's given some people
discoloration on their eyes that's
pretty much the number one thing I've
heard and then also once you stop using
it your lashes don't keep growing long
because your lash cycle is so rapid that
your lashes are constantly falling out
growing back in and of course you're not
giving them the serum then they're not
going to grow back in long that's the
only downsides that I've heard from
Latif's I was willing to you know see
what happens and so far my lashes have
gotten a lot longer and I'm so excited
that I could wear mascara and just go
out like I can be one of those girls
that throws on mascara and like pits to
town you know I used to not be that girl
so very exciting for me it just adds
another step to my nighttime routine try
not to forget to do it but I do actually
only do it every other night this little
bottle is really expensive I mean it's
like one hundred and fifty dollars for
this tiny little thing and you only use
one drop on each eye every night I
actually use a tart eyeliner brush and I
apply a tiny drop onto the brush look up
using my other hand I'll lift my eye
like this apply it right on where the
lashes are growing don't apply it all
over your lid try to keep it almost as
if you're tight lining right you're
tight lining your lashline and coat all
the lashes I just keep it in that
targeted area because I don't want
discoloration anywhere I haven't gotten
any I've always had a slight
discoloration but Latisse has not giving
me any issues at all everything has been
Pleasant for me I don't apply it on my
lower lashes but I know that once I
close my eyes the serum may hit them and
then they will also grow I have faith so
that's what I do we shouldn't go ahead
and take another drop and put it on the
other eye when I bought the box it came
with a bunch of little disposable liner
brushes because it's more sanitary it
actually recommends that you use a
different brush on each eye but
just you know I couldn't bring myself
I'm just I'm lazy is what I'm trying to
say this is what I do okay but I'm just
letting you know that it's recommended
that you use the disposable ones one on
each I've sometimes there's like a
little left on my brush I just kind of
hit my brows like why not just whatever
is left over just kind of need those to
grow as well I don't know if it does
anything but that's what I do
I almost forgot like the most important
thing in my skincare regiment it's my
spot treating this is tea tree oil you
can pick up tea tree oil anywhere and it
lasts a really long time it's a little
bit more inexpensive than any other spa
treatment that I've tried what I like to
do is I like to mix my tea tree oil with
either like a cream or I don't know
sometimes water just kind of dilute it a
little bit and I spot treat any
breakouts that I'm having or clog pores
if I see a clogged pore I will
annihilate it instantly with tea tree
oil I'm telling you this is like the
best discovery for breakouts that I've
had so I just lightly go over anything
that looks extra suspect to me okay any
little bumps any little clogged pore I
lightly dab it over those breakout areas
and then I swear to you I kid you know
the next morning it goes down a lot
especially like when you have those
really painful under the skin ones I put
a little tea tree oil on before I go to
sleep and the next morning I can feel
that it's less painful and the bump is a
little bit smaller it doesn't
necessarily make the people go away
right overnight but sometimes it does
I'm just saying it's amazing incredible
I recommend you guys try some tea tree
oils and then of course always make sure
that you look up side effects because
some people do have side effects of tea
tree oil so I'm just letting you guys
know research what tea tree oils are
best things like that maybe do a little
like swatch test because tea tree oil is
very powerful so that's why you have to
dilute it what if you dilute it it just
works miracles I love it so much so that
is pretty much everything for my
nighttime get unready with me routine
I'm going to go lay my head down on my
pillow just kind of you know scroll
through Instagram Twitter snapchat make
sure I catch up on everything I missed
for the day and then force myself to put
my phone away so that I could fall
asleep this is why I can't fall asleep
you see people on periscope and
I'm going to go do what I got to do try
to fall asleep and I'll see you guys in
my next video bye we're here sticking
out record little it get out get out get
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
