today's video is gonna be a makeup
tutorial on this look right here that is
not usually an eye makeup look that I
would do but I love the way it turned
out so let's go ahead and get started
with the tutorial first thing I'm gonna
do is prime my lids I haven't used this
in a while this is the Mac soft ochre
watched a lot of makeup artists recently
do you makeup and they always like tap
on the back of their hand like so I'm
gonna do it so I'm gonna apply this all
over my lid don't mind this little bump
I have here does anybody else get those
I think it's from my glasses sitting on
my skin too long like I just get random
little welts they go away but it's just
like annoying what are you doing there
I'm just applying and I'm gonna take it
all the way over here to because we
don't know where the shadows about to go
it might go all the way over here it is
Memorial Day weekend right now and it's
the first weekend I don't have plans to
go out and get leticia every Memorial
weekend I always want to imeem I'm not
saying it might not happen I just don't
have a plan for it I have a few trips
coming up so I'm trying to really focus
on my fitness you know being healthy
eating salmon not because I'm trying to
lose weight because that's definitely
not my situation but I'm just trying to
like be healthier cuz I was eating
chick-fil-a in and out and tacos in the
same damn day okay that can't be good
for no little buddy sometimes I feel
like when I film I want to be
experimental but then I get nervous cuz
I know I feel like I've messed up the
whole video but today if I mess up then
I mess up so I'm gonna go into my back I
shadow this is uninterrupted I love this
shade I'm gonna start in the middle of
the eye and just take it up into the
brow bone so I'm trying to get artsy
fartsy over here it's such a good brown
I was saying this on snap but I have
been learning from other makeup artists
getting tips and just getting my makeup
done and there's so many other
techniques other than the ones you see
on YouTube and it made me realize I need
to step out of this process being always
the same you know keep educating myself
and makeup and new techniques
like that's what keeps you inspired I
think because then you get kind of burnt
out like I don't know what to do but now
I realize that I'm just not inspired
because I'm not learning you have to
keep learning and educating yourself and
then you're like wow this is it becomes
new to you again an exciting step
outside the box the one thing I will let
you guys know that I'm like personally
as a makeup artist insecure about that
like my skill isn't as good is doing
like a really winged out shadow out here
it's really really hard for me it's
something I struggle with I personally
always blame it on line up my brow bone
and I feel like it kind of in my way
that what are you doing there instead of
going like all the way out it just like
that's just my excuse for my
inadequacies with my winging out
technique but I always feel like I can't
do it very hard for me you know who does
a really good like winged outlook Oh
makeup by arielle you guys don't follow
him like damn it's just so good and I'm
gonna take a black liner pencil this is
perversion by Urban Decay so what I want
to do is start putting this into the
lash line kind of like at an angle and
then slanting it in just like be it and
then take a tiny little pencil brush
this is the morphe and five one five and
I'm quickly gonna start pushing that out
into this outer V that we created trying
really hard to make sure it's all nice
and smoked out and we're gonna put
shadow over the lid still so it's not
that SETI oh you know just and then we
could just start taking it up into the
crease right here so whatever is in this
corner where the crease meets the liner
just kind of start taking it and
blurring it into the edge see where this
is going
maybe not yet I don't know but we're
gonna get there so I'm looking down and
then I'm gonna just dive like little
dots where I need more black and then
I'm gonna just take that brush it into
the crease you know who I'm getting
inspo from right now Laura from melt
cosmetics
I looks and I just love how grungy ins
blown out all of her eye looks are what
I hate about doing looks like this is
like getting everything is symmetrical
on the other side there is no time for
symmetry okay I wish there was something
where you could just copy and paste
pretty sure I've never doesn't look like
this on my channel ever in my life I'm
liking it now to do the other side we
did it now I'm gonna be going into this
morphe palette it's the dare to create
39a palette let's add some color to this
let's add some life I'm gonna go into
this green right here picking up a Smith
230 brush I'm gonna go into that green
and I'm gonna start applying it just to
have some pops of the green in our
crease pick it up right where you left
off the black liner and start adding
that in that was such an easy step but
it adds a Kapow and then I need a
smaller brush here let's see let's see
the morphe and 507 tinier brush I'm
taking the same green I'm gonna take it
across the block and then connect it to
that it's easier to use a smaller brush
cuz the smaller space that I'm not
trying to take up too high and blend it
while keeping the main focus like into
the crease then I'm taking a blending
brush with the uninterupted again and
just connecting that green line up to
the brow bone again and you could also
take that and just run around the edges
here just going across this make sure
it's nice and blended I'm liking it so
I'm kind of working on my house right
now I will for sure be doing some type
of home videos I'm not sure if it's
gonna be like segments so like my closet
or like living room by bedroom like
maybe I'll make it a series maybe I'll
do like a whole before and after
together I'm not really sure but I'm
vlogging everything so you guys could
see and then once I figure out exactly
how I'm gonna do it I will show you guys
I think it's gonna take like four months
honestly for my whole house to be done
that's why I'm like maybe segments so
ordering furniture takes a long time
like it's actually very annoying how
long it takes not gonna lie to you guys
I was looking for something
and I got distracted and I started
packing on black eyeshadow over the
black liner this one doesn't have it yet
but do you see the difference of how
black this one is there's just that one
and it's from that same morphe palette
on an angled brush and pack the black
over all of the liner this is gonna make
it darker it's also gonna set everything
so your liner doesn't go no way when I
first started YouTube you know what I
found really difficult is how to do my
makeup in this little mirror or like
without the mirror being in the shot
because I always have done my makeup in
front of like my mirror closet door on
the floor that's like how I get down and
it's a big ask me or I could see
everything but it's like you can't get
ready in a makeup mirror like that
anymore when you're filming cuz it gets
in the way of the camera that was one of
the most difficult things for me
starting out and now I always do my
makeup and a hand mirror like majority
of the time even when I have the option
of a big mirror I'm just used to it I'm
gonna go into a matte yellow eyeshadow
this is from a Suva Beauty palette and I
cleaned off my morphe at 5:07
just rubs it on the back of my hand so
I'm gonna take that pop it a little bit
of yellow into this upper crease area so
now I'm gonna go ahead and pick up this
shade here which is heart of gold by
dose of colors so what I'm gonna do is
pick up a flat brush and I'm gonna spray
it first with a little bit of fix+ just
because I want to really have a precise
application with this first I'm just
going to apply it a little bit wet and
then pack the reflex over that I'm
starting very light cuz I'm kind of
cutting the crease
it's gonna look nice in a wet that's
what we're going for a little bit of a
sheen and the reason I picked this color
is because even though it looks like it
would be a little bit more bronzy it
actually pulls more of the yellowy green
now we have that nice lid color on make
sure you get all the fallout so now I'm
gonna go ahead and take electric warrior
this is Kat Von D and I'm gonna use that
as my inner corner highlight I picked up
the color with a little bit of fix+
on my brush now we're gonna just pop
that in the center there you kind of
want to brush it up and then take a
clean brush and just kind of buff out
the edges one more time now that I've
blended it out I'm going back into the
damp pencil brush with the product and
I'm just gonna focus it right in the
very very corner of our tear duct but
usually I move on to my face makeup but
I want to apply my lashes now because I
just can't wait so I'm gonna go ahead
and pop on a little bit of this
waterproof mascara by Too Faced these
ones are food of beauty scarlet lashes
I'll put them in the description I
forget cuz I've already worn them oh my
god I hate it when my tweezers are
sticky usually I would go to face makeup
then finish off the eyes and I'm just
gonna finish the eyes here so I'm taking
the black liner and I'm gonna start on
the outer part of the eye and we have to
really balance out the lower lash line
because obviously our eye is super heavy
at the top as far as eyeshadow and all
of that so you want to make sure that
your eyes are balanced if I were to just
leave my lashline clean and have all of
this going on on the top it would look
like really top-heavy so don't be afraid
to go in with that black liner and I'm
putting it in the waterline and then on
the lower lash line too
going back to my trusty little morphe
m51 v brush and I'm just gonna start to
buff out those edges connecting it to
the liner at the top I'm taking this
black liner all the way into my inner
corner you know how hard this is gonna
be to take off don't even want to think
about all this black around my eye
alright so right now it looks a little
like oh my gosh this is looking crazy
it's like super heavy but what you want
to do now is take the
interrupted color on a fluffy pencil
brush and we're just gonna go around the
bottom of the edges of this black and
we're gonna soften it a little bit so it
looks gonna look more like a gradient
now and then you're gonna go back in and
deepen the black up again in certain
areas like right here see that now it
has a nice softer appearance here than
it does like here it's just like black
line now we are moving on to our face
makeup I'm gonna be using the Lancome
foundation and this isn't the shade for
10w I'm gonna take that and just start
pouncing it into the skin I recently got
a spray tan as you can see I am a lot
tanner here on my body they tan my face
too but then it went away like but it
was really nice because I felt like I
didn't need to apply any face makeup I
really liked it I was like wow I could
live my life like this I never have had
a spray to him before like I've gone
into little booths where it sprays but
not like somebody spraying you it's
never Pleasant when you have to get
butt-ass naked in front of somebody I
will tell you that much like it's always
like that awkward like so do I take all
my clothes off for like 20 laughter you
know when you have to ask that question
for things waxing laser appointments oh
my god I have a great story time about
my first laser appointment so I decided
like let me get laser I want underarm
laser I want I want you know laser down
there in my areas I've never done it
before so I guess they asked me like you
want the full thing and I was like yeah
of course
like little did I know that the full
thing meant like all right knees to your
chest and I was like this staring at the
ceiling she was holding me up like a
baby getting their diaper changed okay I
was so uncomfortable you guys like I'm
laying there I'm thinking machine to get
like the outside of my bikini it's gonna
be great then once she said knees to
chest I was like wait a minute
knees to chest why would I need to go
knees to chest I will say that the laser
experience was way better than waxing
waxing I feel like hurts a lot more but
I'm gonna go in heavy with my Lancome
this is a foundation stick and I use for
35 this is a nice
just to kind of tan up my face and I'm
gonna go heavy on the forehead here too
cuz I feel like I have a big forehead
we're going full makeup if you haven't
noticed like this is the full makeup
experience I'm taking it there I'm
taking my morphe g---forty so I'm gonna
start pushing at the base the contour
and lightly pushing it upwards blending
it all out I have so much makeup on
right now like push it into that
hairline first I like to take the excess
off on the back of my hand and then
blend out this area first I initially
take this brush and blend out that
bronze but do you see how it kind of
starts to match with the rest of my body
now it's starting to warm up my whole
face so that I look more like my body
and then I just go in with my Beauty
Blender and you really want to work that
into the skin make sure everything is
nice and blended and there's no brush
strokes get that nose contour blend it
out I'm using one of these BH Cosmetics
brushes I just got these this is the 7
brush taking whatever is left over on my
brush and if there's anything and just
connecting the area and softening it up
so the transition between it see is a
little softer now for my concealer I'm
gonna be using a new concealer I've
really been liking this one it's the
Dior under cover concealer I'm in the
shade 40 I'm gonna take a little bit of
this right under the eye area boom now
that I'm doing my under eye shadow
before my concealer I feel like I use
less concealer because I'm always trying
to conceal the redness under my eyes and
if it's already covered anyway with eye
shadow then it's kind of pointless and I
use less product so here's my little
baby Beauty Blender and I'm just gonna
start blending that out this concealer
does dry down pretty matte so just make
sure you work it into the skin and set
it right away now I'm going into an old
concealer that I used to use which is
the NARS ginger and I'm gonna use this
more so like lower where the hollows are
instead of directly under
and on the sides of my nose and then
blend it out oh my god I forgot that I
had that Brown foundation under my lip
huh why don't you tell me okay so I'm
taking this out here that really
brightens up that under eye taking my
bigger Beauty Blender and just melting
everything together see that bright
under eyes yes by putting that dark
brown under there by the way that was
kind of makes your lower lip look bigger
because it creates a bigger shadow under
your lower lip so that's why I did that
now I'm gonna take my concealer and look
straight forward and create a straight
line and I'm gonna go ahead and blend
that line down the bridge of my nose I'm
gonna go back into that brush we used
earlier and just soften this again
soften that all for the under eyes I'm
gonna use the peach perfect to face
powder to set the smells so peachy like
it's almost crazy how peachy it smells
like and I really like that the powder
has a pink undertone I feel like it
really brightens especially when you
have a look like this you want it to be
really bright so I'm using my baby
Beauty Blender I'm gonna dip it in there
and I'm gonna start applying that under
the eyes and on the sides of the nose
Pat it off on the back of my hand just
so I don't have too much build up in one
spot make sure to put a lot right here
and any shadows it's a good super
brightening I love the way it makes my
under eyes look I'm really vibing with
it I'm gonna take a little bit of that
down the center of my nose all right now
I'm just taking that same BH Cosmetics
number seven brush and I'm just dusting
off any excess powder I'm just gonna
take a little bit of powder on the
forehead area where I get coyly very
just lightly dusting that powder
everywhere adjusting it off the face now
we're gonna go into a little bit of
bronzing so I've already laid down the
foundation stick as a bronzer so now on
top of that I'm gonna be using the fake
bronzer by Milani in oh five I love love
love this bronzer it's so beautiful it
just gives you a really really nice
Sheen it has like gold flecks in it so
if you don't really like that you know
just be aware it warms up your face
really nicely and it gives you a pretty
glow for this eye look I love green and
like pinky tones together it reminds me
of watermelons like I really really like
it
so for the blush I think I'm gonna go
with a pinky tone this is one of my
favorite blushes you guys know I use it
all the time Mac peaches like I just
feel like that's gonna be really pretty
it's like something about pink and green
it's just juicy for my highlight I'm
gonna be using this morphe palette this
is the 8h I'm gonna be mixing these two
colors this is called Big Bang and Venus
and I'm gonna be using those on my
cheekbones to highlight my face I like
the idea of the gold mixed with a little
bit more of the pinky peachy
rose gold color I feel like it goes and
I say with like the bronze tones that
I'm going for not too extreme just a
nice Goldy bronze tone take it into the
temples I'm kind of like up in here
really blending that out then also gonna
take it on the chin really blend out the
edges we got a lot of makeup on guys
I'm taking my fix+ mulching those
powders in because we're kind of powdery
that kind of melts your highlight in hot
everything in so you don't have any
water drops anywhere so now it's time
for the lips and I have been trying to
learn the proper way to over line my
lips without making them look like oh my
god you look crazy over line type of
vibe and usually I don't really use the
pliner with nudes I just kind of like
put it on but now I've got my makeup
done by a professional artist who have
made my lips look massive with lipliner
and I'm kind of just like what insane
without making them look fake or like oh
my god your lip liner is way the hell
over here I feel there's a huge
difference between right now no lip
liner
then I'm going to be going in with some
lip liner this this is the LA girl lip
liner in shade cafe and it's honestly
such a good lip liner I would even
compare them to Mac lip liners and la
girl is really affordable so if you're
interested in an affordable lip liner
I'm telling you these are really really
great you want to start way under like
my natural lip ends right here this is
where my natural lip line would be I'm
gonna take it down here see how much
more like a look at that and then as you
get closer to the edges like the corners
of your mouth you take it in warmer it's
creating a deeper shadow on the lip so
that your lip looks bigger you could
even take a darker color like stripped
down by Mac is good actually stripped
down and cafe are actually kind of dupes
okay so that's the lower lip and then
here you want to over line up above the
Cupid's bow and make your lip bigger in
the center just like we did up there so
I just added a lot of girth okay see
just like look how much bigger my lips
look right now I know it looks kind of
crazy like cuz I've only done the top
but so don't over line too much when we
get to these corners cuz then it starts
to look like really wide see that how
much better they look now all right so
now I'm just gonna take this Real
Techniques shading brush and I'm just
gonna blend that lip liner out into the
lip so we have a nice little fade
gradient now I'm using the k'kaw
lipstick and classic kay this is the
lipstick with makeup by Mario and honest
start packing that onto the center of
the lip this is gonna be the shade we
use because it has a nice pink undertone
use that same Real Techniques brush and
blend it in
now you lips look massive and then to
top it off and we'll be using neat-freak
and this is the Shayla gloss with color
pop and this is the finished makeup look
so that's it for this tutorial I really
hope you guys enjoyed figuring out this
makeup look with me okay
it's pretty much what I was doing I
don't think I've ever done I look quite
like this on my channel but I really
really enjoyed it and I love the way it
