hey everyone welcome back to my channel
so today's video is gonna be a makeup
tutorial on this look right here I love
how this makeup look turned out and I
loved when I saw this makeup look for
the first time on Palafox SIA if you
guys don't follow her on Instagram she's
an amazing human she's so gorgeous this
look is 100% inspired by her since and
it's just so different and eye catching
with the glitter cutting the crease I
really like this makeup look because
it's a cut crease which is like
something that's done all the time but
by cutting the crease with a line of
glitter it just changes the look
completely and makes it so interesting
and fun to look at and fun to create so
when I first saw her do this makeup look
I was like can I even do that with my
eyelid once I opened my eyes it would
just like fold into the eye sockets I
practiced and I figured out how to do it
usually I don't practice my makeup looks
before I film them but this time I was
like I need to practice just so that
when I teach you guys I'm not a hot mess
so I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
and let's go ahead and get started first
step is priming your lids always and
I'll be using the Mac prep and prime for
this I'm just going to use my finger to
apply it and evenly distribute it along
my entire lid next you always want to
set your eyeshadow base so that way the
cream doesn't stay sticky or tacky on
the lid and the powders will glide
easily and I like to focus most of the
color on the brow bone and then
whatever's left over work my way down to
the crease next I'm taking this nice
reddish orange tone and this is from the
busy art pilot as well on a small
definer brush and what I'm doing is
roughly mapping out where I want to be
crease to be if you have any issues like
me you see I have these folds so I
constantly have to check to make sure
that once my eye is open the cut crease
doesn't get you know sucked into my eye
sockets so I'm just working around it
and making sure to draw in slightly
higher
and I always keep the blending brush
next to me so that I could blend away
the edges of every line that I make so
after every step I always take the
blending brush and go over those lines
that way it just makes the process
easier to blend as you go I'm now taking
this flat brush by Smith cosmetics and
I'm going to take a tiny amount of
concealer a very tiny amount and really
clean up that crease because I did make
such a rough sketch of the crease that I
want to make it really sharp so if you
make any mistakes you can always do this
and it's totally fine and it makes it
look really clean and sharp that's what
we want so after I have like a solid
line now that it's clean its sharp it's
the shape that I need I'm going to
really build on that red orange color
and keep building keep blending until
it's as dark as I want it to be I want
the crease to have a really nice
gradient from dark to light so I'm
taking the dark brown shade in the
palette and I'm going to apply this
closest to the crease or the faux crease
that I created here and just go right
along the edge there like I said always
buff away whatever line do you make
right after so everything stays nice and
smooth
I decided I wanted a super defined dark
line going across the crease so I took a
tart liner brush with that same brown
eyeshadow and very lightly with hardly
any pressure I'm just feathering that
dark brown eyeshadow along the crease
line now going into this palette that
I'm really excited about this is the
urban decay Alice Through the Looking
Glass palette I'm taking this really
pretty iridescent pink shade and I'm
going to pack that on to the lid and
really just clean up that crease clean
along the edges and I'm also going to
sweep that eye shadow right above the
crease down and out towards the tail of
the brow just right over here
so this is the tricky part of the makeup
look especially if you have a difficult
crease situation so you want to make
sure that your eyes are open when you're
applying this because you don't want to
apply it and then you open your eyes and
the glitter gets like sucked away into
the abyss that is the higher socket so
I'm taking a future by la girl this is
just like a gold liner and it doesn't
have glitter I couldn't find the urban
decay liner that I wanted to use but
this is what I used when I practiced
anyways and I gift it into the lit
cosmetics beach babies glitter so first
I'm going to make the line with the gold
and when it's wet I'm going to then tap
the gold loose glitter on top you want
to make sure to work in slow steady
strokes that way you have a smaller
chance of making any really big mistakes
and here I'm just tapping that glitter
right over it while it's still wet
moving on to my gel liner I'll be using
the Inglot black gel liner with the same
tart brush that I was using earlier and
just create a wing and I'm going to
apply a coat of mascara this is the new
Too Faced waterproof mascara which is
really really really good it makes your
lashes curl I just have a really hard
time taking it off but it works amazing
and of course I'm using my iconic lashes
by house of lashes it always helps to go
over your lash band with a liquid liner
that way it hides any lash glue and it
just looks a lot cleaner and of course
I'm going to quickly fill in my eyebrows
I do have a video coming up soon with a
full brow tutorial for foundation I'm
going to be using the benefit hello
flawless this used to be a favorite of
mine back in the day I don't know why I
stopped using it because I started using
it again the other day and I remembered
how much I love this foundation I'm in
the shed oh
beige beige so I'm just taking that on
my Beauty Blender
stifling it on the reason I love the
benefit hello flawless is because it
gives you full coverage but it also
makes your skin look not super matte but
not oily it just kind of looks healthy
dewy without being too oily it's like
the perfect finish I would bring my
foundation down my neck but I'm
literally going to bed right after this
I think it's like currently 1:00 a.m. so
we'll just pretend that my neck is just
as covered in foundation as my face for
NARS I'm going to go in with my favorite
concealer and it's the creamy concealer
and ginger so I also use a concealer to
go right underneath the liner to make it
really sharp school cut a beige Beauty
Blender blend it all in every single day
I say it does don't film late film early
in the day so that you know you could
slay the rest of the day you could take
pictures you could go out and run
errands with just great makeup on
instead of looking like a potato and yet
here I am filming late nobody's gonna
see it but make Stephen take me to
Denny's real quick you know now I'm
going to set my under eye concealer
using my Laura Mercier translucent
powder this is my dose of colors a
setting powder brush I gotta make this
really ugly face make sure that you know
you have to set before you crease I get
a shadow here that makes my nose appear
wider so I'm going to kind of put that
there to make my nose look a little bit
more narrow just bake it real quick
just a quick bake also here on these
laugh lines I need to drink more water I
noticed that when I don't drink water my
under eyes get really Creasy do you
hydrated from that New York trip fill me
a little too turnt alright so I'm going
to set here under my eye but I'm not
going to set anywhere here or about to
put some cream
my lighter on and you don't want to put
cream on top of powder I know I say bake
but I literally just do it for two
seconds and then I just get impatient
and dust it off all right so we're going
to use a new product I'm really excited
I just got this this is the Pat McGrath
labs golden shiny stick and I also have
the highlighters here people made fun of
me for the way I said the name am I
saying you're wrong Pat McGrath is it th
yes yeah
highlights it's on you if I'm wrong
alright anyways amazing makeup artist
obsessed with these products and I've
had my eye on like every product ever
made when I see photos I die so I was
really really excited to get these this
one is fine gold and obviously it has
more of a gold undertone so if you see
this one it is iridescent pink I'm
debating using this just because it
might pull in with all the pinks and
it's a fun highlight so it looks like
this with an iridescent pink sheen which
might look really cool with this makeup
look you know very artistic this one is
the fine gold this is like oh god I just
died for this one and this is on like a
really dry hand no primer super dry skin
so it's still looking really good but I
feel like this might look really cool oh
I'm gonna go with this one it's because
it's different than what I usually use
I'm glad we made that decision together
thank you guys
first I'm going to use the highlighting
stick so one side has a bomb just like a
clear balm you know for photoshoots when
you want to look wet and this side is
the cream highlight side similar to the
other cream highlights I use like
benefit say Thank You Steven Sonia
Kashuk this one is in the shade nude I'm
just going to use my ring finger and
apply that to the tops of my cheekbones
and this is going to be our base I apply
with one finger and then I blend out
with another because you don't want it
all over the place
I'm just gonna slowly build this up so
you can wear this by itself and give
yourself just a really effortless glow
not too crazy you know maybe you've been
at the beach sweating a little bit but
like a sexy sweat with shimmer and we're
just gonna go in with the iridescent
pink I'm so happy I went with the pink
ohh oh my god
oh yeah oh yeah are you seeing this
Steven I was actually really scared of
this color I love that the highlight is
pink
it's not about natural highlights
anymore everyone knows it's not natural
and so I'm gonna go in with the gold or
one to do the nose and lip highlight
because I think pink would be maybe a
little grey see this one's actually like
really gold as well but I love the way
it looks for bronzer we're going to use
a different bronzer today I'm going to
be using the urban decay Beach bronze
bronzer and this is in the shade bronzed
take that on my tapered blush brush by
dose of colors it's gonna really blend
that with the highlight
along the hairline jawline I don't want
to go too crazy with the face makeup I
want to keep it very soft if you will
I'm trying to say is I want the
highlight to be stronger than the
contour and bronzer I want the bronzer
to be a little bit more subtle and then
I'm just going to go ahead and take my
Mac Studio Fix powder and NC 45 with a
Smith cosmetics brush in 247 and I'm
going to do my nose contour right way
then I take my Beauty Blender and just
kind of go right over that to make it
look a little bit more natural alright
so for blush I'm going to try this one
it's new from Becca it's the luminous
blush and it's very shimmery so we'll
see how this goes this isn't the shade
Tigerlily it's nice because I thought
it's gonna be super sparkly cuz when you
look at it it's kind of like really
shimmery but it just kind of looks like
a nice healthy sheen complements the
highlight yes then I have to finish my
under eye now that we finished the face
makeup so I'm going to take the same
color that we used in the crease this
one here I'm actually going to mix it
with this one here to soften it up a
little bit and apply that on my lower
lash line because our upper eye is like
super heavy so we have to balance it on
the lower because it's balled right now
so let's just go ahead and smoke that
out and then I'm going to take the dark
brown shade as well and define the outer
part of the lash line closest to the
waterline right around this area and
then I just decided to apply this in the
waterline this is crybaby by colour-pop
it's just this lavender pencil all right
and then after I'm going to go ahead and
use the same highlight that I used on my
cheeks as my inner corner highlight of
the eyes before I do my lipstick I'm
going to use the Urban Decay makeup
setting spray
oh I forgot to put mascara on my lower
lashes I'm gonna do that too off camera
just so you know I forgot to do it this
time because I'm still getting used to
it I was watching Mac Daddy snaps what
he does and it works so good he puts
fixed plus by Mac all over his face and
then as it's like slightly drawing oh I
saw this on his YouTube channel actually
you put the highlight before your fix
plus dries or your setting spray and it
just like makes the highlight pop even
more I already did it the other way but
I just wanted to give you guys that tip
because I learned it on his channel okay
so for my lips I'm going to line them
using hazelnut tea by Laura Mercier I'm
going to be using the NYX soft matte lip
cream in London to fill that in I was
just sharing on snapchat how these are
really really good affordable cream
lipsticks
you
alright so that is it this is the
finished makeup look I really really
loved filming this makeup tutorial
I felt so inspired and I just want to
say thank you guys so much for also
sending me all the inspirational images
I know a video back I was talking about
how I was a little bit in a makeup funk
and I was feeling just like not inspired
at all and so I felt like it was killing
me to make a video when I didn't feel
inspired and so when you guys send me
all those photos on Twitter it really
just I feel like reenergized me I love
how this makeup look turned out I just
wanted to say thank you guys and if you
have any other requests keep sending me
photos I have saved a lot of requests
from you guys so I have ideas for
upcoming videos and that is about
everything I'll see you guys in my next
video bye what is your problem
