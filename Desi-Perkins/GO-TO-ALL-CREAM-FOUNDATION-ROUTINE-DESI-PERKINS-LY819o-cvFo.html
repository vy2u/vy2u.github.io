today's video is going to be a quick one
and I originally wanted to do my cream
foundation cream contour cream highlight
routine and then it turned into like my
go-to easy makeup routine this is the
kind of makeup I wear when I have
meetings what I want to look put
together but I'm not about to wear like
a cut crease or really any eye makeup
except for eyelashes really this is all
just cream products I only used a little
bit of powder to set my under eyes I've
kind of been feeling like using less
powder is just a little bit more
youthful it makes you look radiant
however if you do have oily skin and you
feel that you need to powder your skin
that's fine but I'm talking more along
the lines of like using powder and cream
contour and then powder contour and then
cream highlight and then powder
highlight this kind of just simplifies
everything and if you need to set your
makeup with like a translucent powder
that you can go ahead and do that it's
still going to give you that glowy look
I just wanted to show you guys how to do
your makeup and do a little less it's a
little bit quicker and it's just Khloe
blowy glowing no we go glowy let's go
ahead and get started first thing I want
to do is prime my skin I'm using the
Marc Jacobs primer any primer that you
have is good I just like to use one
that's a little bit more hydrating put
it all over your face under the eyes
forehead when it comes to like ease more
liquidy primers I'm not that picky with
which one I use it's more so these
thicker primers that I feel like make a
huge difference for me so then I like to
use the Tarte primer this one is the
clean slate timeless smoothing primer
it's one of my favorites for the under
eye and I know that sounds really weird
but this is just what I've been using
lately so I take like a little bit of it
tiny amount in the back of my nail not
this front not this part because that's
not sanitary
and then I dab it under my eyes really
lightly because I feel like this really
helps with under-eye creasing for me
this one really really helps fill in any
pores like for example a lot of people
have the largest pores on the apples of
their cheeks so I put it under my eyes
and on the apples of my cheeks and I
don't put this primer anywhere else
because it's kind of thick so I just
apply it in those stubborn as
areas very important step for me when
I'm doing like an event or something I
just have to have this under my eyes and
I just put the tiniest amount and I warm
it up on the back of my hand first too
because sometimes when you take it
straight out of the container it's like
it needs to be warmed up worked in it's
a little too thick X I'm going to do the
stick foundation I like to use the
hourglass stick foundation but I'm going
to go ahead and mix amber and beige
Amber's a little bit darker than beige
but I like to mix them to get the
perfect color for me so I'm going to go
ahead with amber first and just go in
and apply it see how warm this color is
super warm but I like it because it
gives me a nice tan and then I take
beige which is not as warm I just put it
in the center of all of these ones you
could also put this more in your
highlight areas boom so now that we have
our foundation laid out I'm going to use
a kabuki style brush this one is by Kara
D and it's f27 I switched it up all the
time between kabuki brushes but with
this foundation I feel like I like
applying it this way more so than a
Beauty Blender I don't know why I just
feel like it looks better so you're
going to want to start mixing it all
together and the trick with cream
foundations because usually I'm not a
fan I feel like they're slippery
sometimes and they settle into fine
lines if the trick is is you want to
buff this into your skin really really
well so you just want to keep buffing
and working it in until it's almost just
a really nice light layer of cream so
that's why I like to use this brush
because I don't a Beauty Blender I feel
like doesn't really work it into the
skin it's really good at working in like
liquidy foundations but I think with
cream it needs a little something a
little bit more dense
when I saw JLo when I met her Oh still
like crazy to say that but what I saw
her skin I noticed that it was all very
like a lot of creams I didn't really
notice like a trace of powder at all on
her face she looked so glowy and dewy
and I think that's kind of why I was
like oh let me try to do that I feel
like it made her look so youthful and
just amazing next I'm going to use some
concealer I'm going to be using the NARS
creamy concealer and this isn't a shade
bisque bisque has a little bit more
Orangi undertone so it's good for dark
circles it's a little bit closer to my
skin color this look for me is a little
bit more natural I don't want it to look
like super bright under eyes but if you
still love that right under-eye look
then you could go ahead and use your
highlighting concealer I'm going to go
ahead and use this one alright so we're
just going to go right here and then I
try not to put it too close to my lower
lash line because like I said I want the
look to look a little bit more natural
if you put too much product underneath
the eyes it's going to crease more and
it's going to look more obvious that
you're wearing a lot of concealer then
I'm going to take my Beauty Blender and
just blend that out I'm still blending
the concealer up into my lower lash line
but I'm not putting the product directly
onto the lower lash line that way it's
less product but it still gives you good
coverage up there the only powder I'm
going to be using in this tutorial is to
set my under eyes because I did try this
makeup look without setting my under
eyes and I found that it's still creased
a little bit so I'm going to use powder
for that but before you do that I'm
going to use the L'Oreal True Match this
is what I've been wearing as my
highlight when I do this like creme
makeup type of look and it's so nice in
the shade golden golden just golden so I
put a little bit of that on the back of
my hand a lot of people asked how to
apply cream highlights the trick is I
feel like you have to put them on top of
creams as well when you put them on top
of powders they start to get a little
bit patchy
so I'm taking it on the back of my
Beauty Blender
and I like to kind of just look and see
where the light hits okay
right here and we're just going to go
ahead and start placing it right there
and slowly blending it out around the
highlight points of your face take a
little more this highlight comes in
different colors but the reason I like
golden is because it is somewhat of a
toned down highlight so the color itself
doesn't look like super white you know
when you use a really bright highlighter
sometimes it can look very white so it
doesn't look like that it kind of just
melts into the skin and looks close to
my skin tone and under this sliding it
doesn't look as popping but when you hit
the sunlight trust me this highlighter
works really really well so I put it on
the high points and then of course I put
it on the Cupid's bow and I do that with
my finger so you can continue to layer
this on what I like to do to make sure
that it's not super blotches like I did
apply it with the Beauty Blender and
then do one light layer that's like a
halo and then you want to add a little
bit more on the high points where you
want more highlight and then it's going
to pop only where you want it and blend
out really really nice the next thing
I'm going to do is slight contour I'm
not going to apply too much of this
sometimes I skip this step and I like I
said I'd use the darker stick foundation
as a contour but I'm just going to use
own
and I'm pushing the product upwards I'd
like to do this after the highlight
sometimes because it almost melts
everything together and putting the
darker on top of light doesn't make it
as ashy as it would the other way around
and I also don't want it to look overly
contoured I want to look sunny going
back in for my foundation brush and just
lightly patting over the edges of that
bronzer now if you need to set your
under eyes which I'm going to do with a
very light amount of powder I'm not
going to do like any bacon or anything
you can go ahead and do that now that
you don't the creams also if you do tend
to get really oily around your nose area
or anywhere on your face you could still
do creams but just make sure that you
set your makeup you find that you have
more dry skin or you don't usually need
to set your makeup then you don't have
to I kind of liked that overall dewy
look that I get towards the end of the
day with this but if you don't set it
and forget it
so I'm just going to use my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and I'm just
taking a little bit of that on the back
of my Beauty Blender and pushing it into
the skin very light amount when you use
a damp Beauty Blender to do this very
slightly damn it kind of melts the
powder into your skin I find it gives
like a little bit more of a natural
effect whatever's left over I kind of
taped down on the sides of my nose
because I do get oily there I don't want
to get oily so just a little powder
since I'm here I might as well show you
guys what I usually do to finish off my
makeup when I do this look I don't apply
any eyeshadow I just put on my queen
bees
I like Queen bees for this kind of look
because they're really fluffy but they
still give your eyes a little pal Park
these bitches right here woah hold
please so just with adding lashes to
this look it still gives you an
effortless feel also looks like you did
a lot of eye makeup but you did it my
trick this is the kind of makeup I wear
when I'm like have to go to meetings
basically my everyday life this is what
I do the only eye makeup I really have
to wear when I add eyelashes is black
liner to the waterline up here because I
don't like when you could see skin
through the lash band and your eyelid so
I'm going to go ahead and just take
black liner and
it up here you're not used to applying
eyelashes I promise you get so much
easier and helped me if I look down into
a mirror because when you look down you
could really see where you're putting
the lash it just makes it a little bit
easier also if you apply lashes more
than once the same pair they start to
get a lot easier too
so your day to day getting ready time
becomes a little bit quicker oh the
Saints a little sharpen a sharp e sharp
toss me that sharpen our plate
I'm gonna use my favorite liner this is
Maybelline lasting drama waterproof gel
this stuff it's just like the best so
dark it says block is my little
brother's soul over there
also if you have more lashes that eye
you might want to apply mascara before
your eyelashes but since mine are so
tiny sometimes it doesn't even matter so
you know this is the real deal this is
what I do when I'm trying to do the most
but the bare minimum at same time and
the last thing I do to this look this is
so easy this is the only other powder I
use but I love to use the Laura Geller
gilded honey highlight and a pencil
brush pop it into the inner corner of
the eyes and it just makes everything
look cohesively glowy I just want you
guys to know that I'm about to head into
target right now it is currently 9
o'clock p.m. I am fighting the fight
against the Christmas tree again I have
bought a Christmas tree for the office
and like all my Christmas tree purchases
this year the tree had failed me the
lights don't work
so I'll go back to Target right now with
my queen bees and be like excuse me I'm
going to be that person that opens the
next box at Target plugs it in and I
need to see it work before I leave that
store kind of went a little crazy on the
side let me blend that home for my lips
I usually just do something nude
obviously you guys know this about me a
gloss works for this because like I said
I like to keep that overall glowy look
I'm gonna apply lipstick and then I'm
going to top that off with the anasazi
Beverly Hills lip gloss and Gildan this
is gonna give us the shine baby alright
so that's it I hope you guys like this
type of video I wanted to just show you
guys a more simple tone down quick easy
look this is something
I've been doing a lot lately and you
don't need a lot of products let me know
what you guys thought in the comments
