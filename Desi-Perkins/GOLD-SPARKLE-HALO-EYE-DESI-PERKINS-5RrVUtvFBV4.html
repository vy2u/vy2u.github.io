the today's video is going to be a
makeup tutorial on this look I love how
this turned out I think it's so fun it's
festive and I was actually inspired by
an artist 17 years old okay she's from
Houston Texas loves Texas her name is
Alison cold she's such a cute amazing
artist this is the picture that inspired
me I love how she posts all closed up
I shop so you guys need to go follow her
because I'm telling you right now she
just has it what I love finally artists
like this who have so much Drive and
talent creativity so you guys should go
check her out she's amazing this look
was inspired by her so thank you Alison
if you guys are interested in this
makeup tutorial keep on watching first
thing we're going to do is prep our lids
I'll be using the air control
I've already taking a little bit on this
little dish here and I'm just gonna take
it with a flat brush and apply it in the
center of the lid and then work my way
out to take my finger to kind of buff it
out so that it bends out the product a
little bit not super heavy at the base
diffuse these edges because these were
the blending really matters with your
crease colors and also make sure to put
some in the inner corner here because we
will be applying eyeshadow there too
just always make sure that it's like a
nice even layer this is a wave a
concealer buffer next I'm just going to
take like I always do a cream colored
eyeshadow and set the base I think I'm
going to start skipping these two steps
when I do tutorials because I feel like
you guys see them in every video always
something that I do when I do my eye
shadow never really changes I'm going to
try not to really set too much of the
center of the lid area because I want to
put a shimmer there and I don't want to
put too much matte eyeshadow when I
apply the shimmer it might look a little
lackluster so first I'm going to pick up
this shade right here it's rubbish I
shadow for melt cosmetics one of my
favorites mustardy light brown shades
picking it up on one of my favorite
brushes a Smith 235 and what I'm going
to do is create the halo effect I'm just
going to apply it on the outer corner in
circular motion so I switched over to
Smith's 230 it's a little bit smaller
and I'm just going to pack that on to
the outer portion of the eye
and start to buff it out here and then
with that brush that we had before the
fluffier one I'm going to use this to
kind of diffuse it and buff out those
edges we're also going to take that
brown over here in the inner part of the
eye right where your crease ends in the
inner corner right above where you would
put your inner corner highlight I just
kind of stick my brush in there and
wiggle it around hello Katie on the horn
okay you know just over here filming it
- really yeah girl I told you should I
was willing it yeah I'm Laurie
I've already commenced the process here
say hi to the piece I had a let her go
real quick so we could see she needed to
just keep building this eyeshadow in the
outer corner of your eye and in the
inner corner here what most of the
product in this crease but then don't be
afraid to diffuse it a little bit up
into that brow very editorial very she's
very chic and I'm just taking this clean
brush and kind of just blending all
together diffusing those edges making
sure it's nice and smooth like I always
do my little trick if I feel like I've
blended my eyeshadow too far I always go
back into that bone color that we used
to set our base and I kind of just
almost erase the mistakes that I've made
clean it back up so that ensures that it
doesn't get too crazy up here in the
brow bone just keep building this until
I feel pleased satisfied all right okay
I'm going to narrow and I'll be back so
next I'm going to go into the morphe 35o
palette and I'm going to take this dark
brown any dark brown eyeshadow you guys
have looking for my brush am I the only
one who like when I'm doing my makeup my
servicing everywhere and then when I go
back to look at them nowhere to be found
I'm using the Smith 230 still tap right
into the inner corner of the eye right
here and start with a little bit of
product just in case you know you mess
up and I'm also going to apply that
right here on the outer part of the eye
and as I chop I kind of sweeps like a
light tap with a little bit of a wiggle
so that as you're putting down the
product you can kind of blend it out
just slightly I really like halo smoky
eyes because I feel like they're a
little bit easier than doing like a
really really blended cut crease loves
me a good at halo uh that's pretty good
next time pick it up Maybelline's gold
rush this is one of their little chef's
Easter concentrated crayons we're going
to kind of
that is a little bit of a bass using my
little concealer brush and it's kind of
buffing out those edges and giving it a
even spread across the center so I
decided to pick up color pops alchemy
eyeshadow this is like I mean just look
at it in the camera it's so pretty
it's really nice it's like that topper
almost because it has a lot of shine
I'm going to tape that on my finger and
just press that into the center this is
like one of my favorite sparkly
eyeshadows you can kind of put it on top
of anything really because it doesn't
have that much of a color it's really
nice it's like a highlight for the
center of your lid so I'm just taking my
brush and distributing it all over whoo
so now we have to do the fun part fun
for some glitter is kind of the devil to
some this is gold by mac cosmetics just
a nice gold glare and I think I'm going
to apply it with a little bit of the
violet Voss glitter glue taking that and
I'm going to apply a light layer top it
all over this area I'm also going to go
ahead and apply it on the other side and
add the glitter glue on my lid I'm going
to try not to like blink too much or
open my eyes fully so that my whole lips
don't get stuck together now I'm going
to dip back into the glitter with the
same brush and just Pat it oh that's a
lot okay we could just hide it all over
you don't necessarily need it to like be
super opaque you kind of just want a
light layer glitter look at that and
kind of look what I'm also going to
bring it up into the crease slightly now
I'm gonna take a makeup wipe and attempt
to remove all this glitter and then take
a clean spoolie and just like whatever
stubborn ones don't come off flick them
off that's good enough for me now what
we're going to do is take that same lash
glue and I have little tiny chunky
glitter confetti type things take a
really fine liner brush and dip that
into a little bit of lash glue I'm going
to start doing some dots of where I want
to stick the chunkier parts of glitter
and then I'm going to take the same
brush to pick up the confetti place it
on those dots so it's good to use the
same little liner brush because since it
has some of the glue leftover on it it
helps pick up the
the pieces of glitter note to self do
not drink coffee before this process my
hand is literally trembling I also have
some smaller flecks of glitter that just
look like this craft glitter so be
careful also apply dots of that the more
variety of glitter size you have the
more sparkly and interesting your eye
look looks oh I love it
I love it I'm also going to put it right
here into the crease area because I
kinda want the glitter to go not all the
way up but I have like a gradual fade
into the crease so I'm alternating
between the little pieces of glitter and
the bigger ones here just know this is
like craft glitter not supposed to be
for use for eyes but you know I live on
the wild side so next I'm gonna apply
some mascara this is Lancome mr. big or
Mon Co big just going to lightly coat
them so that I can put on my falsies I'm
using my iconic light lashes these are
perfect for this look because they are
light enough to where all the glitter
will still show through and they're nice
and fluttery but PC at the same time so
PC eye lashes are good when you have any
type of glitter on the lid because it
lets the glitter kind of shine so next
I'm going to do my foundation before I
finish off the eye this is the
Maybelline fit me matte poreless you
guys I used to use this all the time
then you know as a blogger you kind of
like switch up your foundations a lot
just to see what else is out there and
somewhere along the way you forget how
amazing a foundation is and this one is
just everything like I just went back to
it I'm going to shade 228 so do you see
how it just covers all of my healing
breakout and it just looks so good I
love this foundation so much honestly
this is just my favorite foundation I
love the Armani luminous silk and I also
love the Loreal Pro matte oh I think
those are my three favorites all for
different like reasons this one is a
little bit in between a matte and a dewy
even though it says matte and poreless
it doesn't have like a super matte
finish I say don't more of like a satin
finish and then the armani of course is
more of a dewy finish very luminous if
you will luminous fill
and then obviously the Loreal is like
super Matt the pro Matt we just love how
the foundation looks though wish they
would change the packaging though I wish
they were just add a pump just add a
pump just feel like all foundations at
this point should have a pump you know
because it gets like super messy and
gross even even rock foundations - I'm
like you're going to make me buy a pump
sup you're going to sell a pump
separately I find that kind of annoying
you know give us the pumps so happy I
decided to start using it again you know
your skin changes - I feel like you
should have different foundations maybe
at least - because during drier weather
when your skin gets more dry you want
something a little bit more luminous and
then in the summary they want something
a little bit more matte because you know
you get a little bit more oily it's just
nice to switch it up
Steven looked at my skin yesterday and
he said whatever foundation you're
wearing keep wearing it I said oh okay
it means it looks good so next we're
going straight into concealer I'm just
going to use the shape tape all first
use tan sand and I know this is pretty
dark but I just put it right here for my
darkness if you will my redness in that
area also like right up in this ish
because if I put the lighter one it just
kind of makes it look ashy and then I'm
going to use the medium shade a little
bit lighter also going to run that down
the center of my nose I'm not gonna lie
I really want to hang on my face makeup
yesterday I have this tendency to when
my face is breaking out or I mean
appealing now but like if there's
something I'm insecure about that day I
swear to you guys I will take on my
makeup like nobody's business like I
can't stop it it's like whatever is
making me feel like not so hot that day
I will just start taking it on it's a
problem and then it's like any time you
take on your makeup like you I don't
know I feel like it looks worse than it
does help but I still can't stop myself
from doing it my mind takes control I'm
using the little medium size beauty
blender to blend this concealer out the
concealer just woke me right up so now
that were well I'm going to use the RCM
a setting powder to set my under eyes
every time I film a video it's like a
race against time if I don't start early
enough because I get better makeup
photos with natural daylight than I do
studio lighting
I mean studio lighting photos are great
too but for some reason they all do
Instagram let me tell you it's like
they're too professional-looking you
know people people like like
iPhone photos some like arias what you
want let me give you I also pretty much
a lot of iPhone photos I think they look
really good and it brings out the makeup
a lot more actually so I'm trying so
hard to finish this look before I lose
all of my daylight it's just a tip okay
if you are starting off makeup trying to
take media photos I promise you like
daylight pictures find yourself a nice
little window where you're not getting
hit directly with sunlight but you get
that natural light coming through that's
why my pictures are always in my kitchen
it's like the best window I have in my
house besides that the rest o mentals is
pretty dark okay so I put the artsy ma
but I'm also going to dip into my Laura
Mercier translucent powder so that on
the sides of the nose not under my eyes
because it's too much powder but just
kind of slimming out the nose area here
when you put it on your cheeks right
here where you have the most pores I
feel like it really helps blur all the
pores out now I'm taking my Sigma
tapered highlighter brush and I'm just
going to like lightly dust all of that
excess powder off to make sure you're
not too powdery I'm going to go ahead
and pick up my laura geller highlight
this is one of my favorites you guys
know this I'm going to take that and
apply it with this tiny little Sigma
strobing fan wet the brush a little bit
with some of the Smashbox primer water
and then run it into the highlight
quiet-like
so here start here and then kind of make
a c-shape I'm is going to be lit because
I feel like it really goes with this
look just to be extra a little bit on
the forehead just to give your skin a
nice little sheen I went a little far on
the glow here to up that out a little
bit I'm also going to take a little bit
of artist Couture gold digger well I'm
gonna take you on a smaller brush this
is a morphe doesn't say it's just a more
few little brush and we're going to get
right at the high point and just
intensify that hmm I'm also going to
take that on a smaller little math 2 to
8 brush when I use this for my cube as
well of course I'm highlighting the nose
I'm going to take my a Mac Studio Fix
powder this is a powder foundation this
is NC 45 and I like to put this on when
I have more breakouts
because it's super full coverage
powder foundation and I get my breakouts
right here in my contour from time to
time so I like to just cover them up
more with this powder and it also works
as like a bronzer too I'm using a Mac
116 brush and this is really going to
make your skin look like incredible I
wouldn't do it every day because it is a
lot of makeup into your pores but I mean
God just looks so good afterwards I'm
also just going to place it everywhere I
would put my normal bronzer I'm going to
run that on the jaw line as well round
out those cheeks today and since we're
here I'm just going to go ahead and use
this for my nose contour as well put
that along the front bottom part of my
nails here this color is slightly warm
but I feel like once all the makeup is
on and blush and everything it's okay
don't really notice too much for blush
i'll be using mac's just a pinch this is
a new blush it's kind of metallic e or
like this because it has a really nice
sheen these shimmer blushes look so good
especially for spring because they make
your cheeks look kind of juicy now to
set everything I'm using the primer
water from Smashbox you could use this
as a primer or setting right as well the
eye makeup is basically nearing
everything we did on the top on the
bottom starting off with the melt
cosmetics shadow in rubbish applying it
on the inner corner and the outer corner
of the eye here take the darker Brown
and do the same thing I'm taking a small
tissue weight brush by Max and we're
just going to place this on the outer
part of the eye and the inner part sorry
my mirror blocks you guys half the time
it's really hard for me to see unless
I'm beep inside of this mirror I
remember when I first started youtube I
used to think like how am I going to do
my makeup without being like this close
to a mirror I used to sit in front of
Mir closet doors and be so inside the
mirror that I thought I would never be
able to film YouTube videos like with a
mirror from a distance and I still can't
like some people can put the mirror here
and do it I have to be like really close
so open up my eyes I'm going to use
charts to fake away and especially
concentrate it on the center because the
center is where we want the most
lightness and usually I have to write
put that liner on it kind of messes
with my dark shadow here so I just blend
right underneath the liner let's do an
inner corner highlight I'll be using
this cream crush by Kiko it almost
sounds like a lilac e undertone just ad
or something different I'm going to
apply that right here it has that like
really like beautiful went effect I've
been wanting to use this forever I
purchased it I don't even know how long
you know I was like oh that's going to
be the most beautiful inner corner
highlight and then here we are like
eight months later oh my god if I don't
get a good photograph of this you guys I
will be so sad
oh yeah that inner corner highlight just
gave it to me alright taking a little
bit of the lash glue I'm going to
fearlessly apply that right here on the
lower lash line a light amount at first
because this is the part we're going to
put a little bit of that matte glitter
down oh my god please don't get all over
my face needs a shirt tag and sit this
big mirror here so I could really see
make sure I don't get it everywhere
alright so now we're going to go ahead
and apply the bigger jewels these are
good like if you want to cover your
creasing you know I'm saying yes we're
looking like a disco bomb a nude lip
would look fabulous with this maybe like
a really glossy nude look I think I want
to do let's try it and see what happens
this is a malice Kat Von D alright so I
actually really like this lip it makes
it a little bit more festive like this
would be a great holiday tutorial I also
feel like it just brings the look to
life any lip color I feel like would be
really good with this makeup look a dark
vampy lip a nude lip red lip purple lip
unit lilac if so that's it we're done
Cecil yeah Pamela I had so much fun
filming this makeup tutorial I'm just
feel so passionate about it I really
really love how it turned out
thank you guys so much for watching
hanging out with me I'll see you guys in
