today I'm going to be doing a graphic
liner so first we want to start off by
applying a base to our lid so we have a
nice smooth canvas and I'm just using
Mac soft ochre this look mainly focuses
on the liner so you want to keep the
shadow really simple I'm just applying a
base shadow and this is cream from the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills and lavish
palette I'm just going to place that all
over my lid and up to my brow bone
so now we're going to start the liner
which I know can be a little
intimidating but we're going to try to
break it up in two steps
so here I'm using my girl lactic pen
liner and I'm just going to start off as
I would any normal eyeliner by applying
it really close to the lash line so now
that we've done that what you want to do
next is create a line that starts at the
end of your lower lash line and pull it
up towards the tail of your brow and
then just sweep that right back towards
the liner we placed closest to the lash
line
so now I'm going to go ahead and switch
to my Inglot gel liner and a Mac 2 6 3
brush and the reason I'm doing this is
because I can control the amount of
product that I want on my brush and
right now I want very little because I
need to map out the line first before I
start to darken it and this will just
make it easier because I know this liner
is super intimidating it is for me to
trust me
as I go along I'm just adding more and
more eyeliner and slowly building this
up so that I make as few mistakes as
possible now trust me you guys I totally
understand this eyeliner is not in every
day go meet your boyfriend's mom type of
look but it's really fun to do and
especially if you're a professional
makeup artist this is
nice look for a photoshoot so
I wanted to show you guys how I create
this so I'm going to go back in with
that girl lactic liner pen and I'm just
going to clean up any edges and also
feather out that tail right there now
I'm going to take a Mac 266 brush which
is another angled brush and I'm just
going to put some of that cream
eyeshadow that we used earlier and clean
it up just in case we lost any of that
intensity so of course this look is
dramatic so it calls for false eyelashes
I'm going to apply these kiss lashes and
pretty
and I'm just going to take my l'oreal
liner and
smudge out my outer lash line just a bit
so after we've done that you want to
apply a white liner to your waterline
and this is going to really open up your
eyes then take your favorite mascara and
apply it to your top and bottom lashes
I'm going into my Ipsy glam bag and
taking my benefit
lolly tint and this is really cool
because you can apply it to your lips or
your cheeks should we lower the camera
well it's already recording ooh like
that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
