today's video is gonna be a get ready
with me because tonight I'm having the
girls over and I thought we can get
ready together and I also thought to
myself like why not do full cut crease
look I want to wing full lashes full
coverage Foundation full coverage
concealer boom just a full blam so I'm
gonna talk you through all the steps and
I've teamed up with Clinique for this
video to show you guys that there beyond
perfecting super concealer and what I
really like about the process of the
makeup look is actually the under-eye
correcting their under-eye corrector is
really good so I'm gonna go ahead and
show you guys that in the tutorial if
you guys are interested in learning how
to get this makeup look then keep on
watching so the first thing we want to
do is cancel out all this redness on the
lid for that I'm going to be using the
clinic beyond perfecting super concealer
today this is in the shade number 18 and
for the under eyes I usually use the
peach corrector here they have an
apricot shade which is a corrector which
is really good for any purple or dark
undertones in the eye I also use shade
number 20 to conceal as well this
concealer comes in 18 different shades
and what's good about using this as your
eyeshadow base is it is long-lasting so
once it sets it's gonna last you all day
on your under eyes and on your lids
I'm just cancelling all of this out and
really evening out my skin tone this is
like a perfect color for me that's not
too light and not too dark so that if I
were to even be doing a more natural
makeup look it wouldn't really look like
I had too much product on my crease or
lid and I just use a flat concealer
brush that way I could get nice and
close to the brow bone I'm just gonna
take a fluffier brush and make sure that
it's nice and smooth out across the
whole entire lid I cancelled out all the
redness now we have a nice blank canvas
for the eyeshadow and then I'm just
taking a nice transition powder to set
right over that I'm gonna be using the
Ava color pop palette here version 8 I'm
going to be using is bonfire we're gonna
take that into the crease
I have to tilt my head back and just
really work that in I'm using a Mac 2 to
4 for this next I'm going to be taking
passport and just applying it into the
crease as well really warming it up now
I'm gonna go ahead and dip into the
darkest Brown shade here which is called
tan line
and I'm gonna go ahead and apply that on
the outer V and then also bring it into
the crease yes I really love these
colors
I mean surprise surprise right and then
bring it up into the crease when I dip
into the palette I always go back into
the outer V first because really that's
why I want my product to be the darkest
and then I will just start buffing it
into the crease I don't like to go in
heavy-handed with the product into the
crease first because I feel like what if
I have too much on and I always feel
safer just patting it here and then
moving forward and then lastly taking it
into the inner corner slightly and this
is where you want the least darkness
depending on the look but this look
that's where I want the least darkness I
want it all to be like out here now that
we are super smoky I'm gonna take the
concealer one more time and I'm gonna
use that to carve out the crease I'm
gonna take a little bit of the concealer
with a flat concealer brush and then we
aren't just going to focus that on the
lid space this is gonna clean everything
up and give us another really nice base
for the eyeshadow that we're gonna put
on the lid and if it's your first time
doing this just works slowly it takes a
little bit of practice to get it right
but it's so easy once you get the hang
of it and once you get to the edges just
kind of feather out the concealer now
we're gonna go into this shade right
here and this is Malibu it's such a
pretty coppery bronze color
I'm gonna take my pinky and apply the
pigment on with my finger first just in
the center and don't worry we're gonna
definitely blend out this harsh line
here now I'm gonna take a concealer
brush and pack that on go ahead and take
this all the way up to where you applied
the concealer I'm gonna go ahead and
take a little blending brush here and
go back into this orange shade and mixed
with the dark brown and I'm just gonna
lightly run it across the edge here
mostly taking that orange shade just
really buffing this out see so now it's
starting to look nice and soft and then
I just go back into the gold and add a
little bit more intensity you want to do
patting motions into what we just did
right because you don't want more harsh
lines and by patting it it just kind of
gives you a nice soft transition yes yes
yes yes yes let's go see this all very
very beautiful alright so I'm just gonna
go ahead and do the same exact thing to
the other side alright so I want to take
a clean makeup wipe really clean up all
the fallout now we're gonna go ahead and
do a wing we're gonna take it there
first I'm gonna be using the Kat Von D
trooper liner to create the wing I feel
like it's easier to use this to create
the shape I start by going along the
lash line and then following the lash
line up and then I take it back so I
like to deepen up that wing even more by
using a gel liner this is shady by dose
of colors picking that up with an LC
liner brush and we are going to really
intensify so yes nice and dark wing I
just applied some lashes in the style
Miami these are Lilly ghalichi lashes
okay so I have my lashes on now I went
ahead and mixed a little bit of my
foundation here and today I'm using the
Lancome ultra wear foundation and I'm
just gonna apply it with a brush
and then I'm gonna take my Beauty
Blender and just really work that all
over I love getting to the part of my
makeup where it's time to do the skin
that is always like my favorite part oh
my god you guys oh I saw the greatest
showmen have you seen that movie uh just
kill me it's so good so good like it's a
musical which I'm not really a musical
person even though I love Disney movies
and I love singing I just don't know why
musicals never really like get me going
but this
Swann is incredible the greatest showman
I'm just the music is really really good
like so good on top of that the acting I
love it what I love the most about this
movie is the the way it's shot it's so
inspiring and made me want to shoot like
a creative video such incredible
transitions basically about how the
circus started and how the guy that
invented the circus like his story Zac
Efron's in it gave me some high school
musical flashbacks which I appreciated
Hugh Jackman is like incredible I didn't
realize I mean I knew he did Broadway
stuff but I've just never really seen
him do it until this movie and then I
was like Wolverine take it there I'm
gonna take a big flat huda beauty
foundation brush taking some of that
foundation down my neck now the star of
the show and we're gonna be using the
Clinique beyond perfecting super
concealer this color in particular is
the shade apricot and this is what you
use to color correct and you use this
before you apply it your normal color to
concealer and that's gonna correct
everything and once it does then you
apply another shade so I'm just taking a
little bit of this on the back of my
hand you see how it has that really nice
peachy undertone boom I'm picking that
up with my Beauty Blender and I'm gonna
start pressing it into the under eyes
and it's meant to look Orange because
like I said this is a color corrector
I'm gonna let this side set a little bit
and then move on to the other side of
the eye now I went ahead and mixed 18
and 20 for a more natural like day
makeup look I'll just use 20 and then
when I want to brighten up the under eye
a little bit more I'll use a little bit
of 18 this concealer is gonna give you
full coverage and it has a really nice
fluid texture so you don't feel like you
have to tug or like rub really hard to
blend it in it's really nice and thin so
this is gonna be really good if you have
dark spots dark circles anything you
really want to cover up without getting
too cakey if you're worried about fine
lines and stuff like that it's
definitely nice and thin but still
having that full coverage so it's not
gonna like be too thick to where it
cakes up in your creases and the
concealer is available at Sephora or you
can visit any
location and they'll give you a little
sample so that you could go home and
test it out yourself and I'm gonna go
ahead and set my under eyes using my
Laura Mercier translucent powder to set
the entire face I'm going to be using
the Becca Hydra mist powder
or the lower lashline I want to do
something really fun add a little color
to the look so I was thinking blue this
is the Urban Decay LSD 24-hour liner
just start applying this on the outer
corner here and all through the
waterline and then I'm gonna bring it
down to the lash line on the outer
corner I have to get really close to my
mirror or else next thing you know I
will have all types of eyeliner on my
contact and I just cannot be having that
now taking a pencil brush and it has a
little bit of the warm tone that I used
up top I'm going to start blending this
out a little bit I think I'm gonna dip
into this shade right here which is
called royal and this is from the violet
Voss the rainbow shadow palette packing
it right on top especially focusing it
on the outer part of the eye and I'm
actually just doing like light patting
motions first then you can always take a
clean blending brush or a flat brush and
just blend out those edges I'm gonna
take a black liner warming up on my hand
and then I'm actually gonna take that on
the outer part of the eye I feel like
that really connects the upper wing with
the lower lash line so I'm taking it all
the way into the inner corner but it's
only this outside part that as you can
see here I brought it down a little bit
lower and I'm just gonna play on that
cat eye shape so then once I apply it
I'm gonna go back with a little brush
and just kind of blend it into that blue
alright I'm just gonna use a little bit
of my Estee Lauder heatwave it's in
shambles in the inner corner of my eyes
just to open it up a little bit so now
I'm going to go ahead and Bron tore this
is the new morphe Brown towards a
bronzer in a contour powder and I'm just
gonna kind of mix them together and do a
light dusting push that into the
hairline oh yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
now we're gonna move into the blush and
for blush I'm gonna be using the bare
minerals Jen nude blush and this is in
the shade that peach though just to tie
in the warm shades on the eyes and if
you guys noticed I'm picking a little
bit more subtle shades for the face
because the eyes are already so loud I
want to keep the focus on the eyes I'm
also gonna take a little bit of that
hoola bronzer and just contour the tip
of the nose here just lightly
and now to make sure all these powders
settle into our skin nicely I'm using
mac fix+
yes yes yes you know what I have this
little fan overnight I stole this from
your infant at the wedding she gave it
to me and I never give it back it's
perfect to drive my fix plus I'm just
gonna be taking a little bit of the
Milani baked bronzer this is in Soleil
Oh 5 so you just use a nice light fluffy
brush and it has a little gold reflux in
it that look really pretty for highlight
I'll be using Stila and the shade
brilliance
for my lip I'm gonna be using dose of
colors more creamer please this is our
collab lip with dose of colors Katy and
eyes on top we've gotta needs a little
bit of gloss the fenty beauty gloss this
