for today's video I'll be doing a chit
chat get ready with me tonight is
Halloween and I don't really have plans
I'm gonna be sitting on my couch waiting
for children to hopefully come and
trick-or-treat which they never do so I
end up eating all the candy I've noticed
a lot of people dressing up as their
favorite icons and I think that's
awesome especially seeing little girls
dressed up as Selena who you know I
decided to be just for fun today really
I was also really inspired to do this
because I recently filmed a video with
refinery29 which I will link down in the
description box below it's all about
being a Latina and what it means to me
how beauty is more than just skin deep
and I feel like Selena embodies that
more than anybody I've ever looked up to
growing up I have also filmed Selena
tutorial in the past that is pretty
similar so if you guys want to check it
out it's more of like an in-depth
tutorial I will link that as well in the
description box so go ahead and check
that out and let's get started actually
I'm not gonna lie I just tried to
extract my face before filming which is
probably the worst thing you could
possibly do because then you become
swollen but here I am I'm using the
infallible Pro matte by norio I want to
be Matt Matt Matt actually mixed a
little bit of the jus a foundation in
latte this foundation has been one of my
favs lately it looks so good another
foundation I've been loving huda beauty
foundation these two are really really
good if you're looking to try a new
foundation I use this UA one in my
Halloween video but I did use a way
lighter color it just covered everything
and it looked really really nice and the
hooda one covers I'm telling you like
anything and you know how if you have
breakouts and you put foundation over it
like your breakout shines through and
you have to spot conceal with concealer
this foundation the hooda one you don't
have to do that if you guys haven't seen
before I've done a Selena tutorial which
I love her so much
that's one of my favorite videos to date
on my youtube channel this instead of
being a tutorial is really just more of
like a chitchat get ready with me I
don't actually have plans tonight
but I want to be Selena and that's just
what I want
okay all right I'm gonna throw on some
quick concealer use my Becca cosmetics
shade medium no beige yesterday was
really fun we went to the Urban Decay
Halloween party and I don't know why my
eyelids are so red I don't know why you
know those mornings you wake up from
like the night before and you're like
whoa you still have like leftover liner
from the night before you're feeling a
little a little rough around the edges
that's kind of how I felt today so
basically my plan for tonight is to just
be Selina and just stay home like and
just bitty bitty bum bum around my house
maybe like five kids show up at my door
because nobody ever trick or treats I
guess kids do like the trunk
trick-or-treating know which sucks cuz
I've just I've never lived in a place
where people come and trick-or-treat
it's always been like a back house that
nobody wants to go to or like where I
live now so it makes me sad I just want
like one kid to come to my door is that
so much to ask I don't think so I don't
think so
I'm gonna give myself some cheeks here
around cheeks I'm just gonna be
contouring here highlighting the face
this morning I woke up and I saw on
Twitter on Vanity Fair they have a
spread with JLo and a rod she's wearing
my high key fades and I just started
doing a chicken dance in my kitchen I
was so happy honestly she can wear
whatever she wants and the fact that she
picked sunglasses that I designed just
makes me so happy
I mean she is one of my idols and I
started crying the minute I saw I guess
it's like when you think about your life
even if you were right now watching are
having like a hard time or like you're
just thinking like my life sucks okay
because I think we all go through a time
where you're just things are really hard
or you know you never think that your
dreams are gonna be reality and you're
kind of just in that place where you
accept that like okay maybe I'll just be
this and this is
what I'll be and that's kind of how I
was like four years ago I felt that way
and I had all these huge dreams growing
up and I just wanted to be so many
different things and then there came a
point in my life where things just kept
being shitty basically and I thought
okay well this is my life and this is
just where I'm about to be and for the
first time like reality hit where I was
like okay I'm not a kid anymore maybe my
dreams aren't gonna come true and that's
okay I'm just gonna have to accept that
I'm gonna be doing something else
and like now it's crazy to me that I
like past that point in my life and I
worked really really hard and now it's
like all of my dreams that I always
wanted like since I was little are
coming true people used to tell me all
the time like well you can't do all
these different things like you can't do
everything you want to do and I feel
like through YouTube and through this
job all of the dreams that I wanted are
coming true like I've always wanted to
design fashion things I've always wanted
to be an artist I've always wanted to
continue to create things and I never
wanted to be doing the same thing over
and over and over again and like I'm
like what job would make me like let me
do that you know and to see JLo I guess
this morning wearing my sunglasses in
Vanity Fair I just started shaking and
crying because it's like all the
emotions that I felt then and now came
together full circle and I I just died a
little bit inside cuz I would have never
thought that I would be doing these
things and like one of my idols would be
wearing something that I designed and I
know she wears some often which makes me
even more happy because I know that
means that she really really loves them
but it doesn't make it any less special
every time I see her where I am like
every single time I feel the same exact
way and I just woke up feeling really
blessed today and really happy and just
gonna set my under eyes real quick with
some translucent powder I'm gonna take
this down here to want some rounder
cheeks here we're just thinking if I do
get trick-or-treaters
tonight I wonder if anyone will even
know who I am like they only know like
Selena Gomez that's their generation
let's do the brows I'm gonna keep them
thin here I cannot believe that in high
school I did not fill in my brows I've
never had strong brows either so it was
just funny looking back at photos
because there was just no growl in
pictures my brows would disappear so it
looked pretty funny if I could go back
and change one thing about my makeup it
would be like girl get some brows on
your face don't you guys feel like
people that are in high school now like
sixteen year olds they don't even go
through an awkward phase anymore like
what is what's up with that that's not
fair how come nobody goes through
awkward phases anymore is it because we
have social media just like confuses me
because I was really awkward at one
point and I don't see 16 15 year olds
looking awkward these days they look
snatched I'm gonna go into the Charlotte
Tilbury pouch this is the instant eye
palette I'm going to use this warm shade
right in here mostly on the outer crease
here looking at this picture actually
what else is new as of right now
probably while this videos either going
live or is live I am on my way to
Australia we are doing an australian
squad tour
we're so excited you guys don't know
Katie John Stephen and I did a squad
tour about a year and a half ago
somewhere around there and we went to a
bunch of different places to do meetups
with you guys and we did it all on our
own
it was incredible one of the most
incredible experiences of my life
and I'll never forget like our first
drop was Arizona and I've know I've
talked about this before but like we
didn't know what we were doing we just
thought like hey we'll just tell you
guys where we're gonna be and we'll have
like this big fun cool Meetup it was a
lot more crazy than we thought it was
gonna be awesome crazy we realized like
oh my god how are we gonna meet
everybody and like I would hate for
people to show up for so long and it'd
be outside it'd be hot not be able to
meet everybody so boys ended up like
scrambling for the rest of the squad
tour to get like solid locations tried
to get more places with air conditioning
and it was just it was a lot of fun
overwhelming like in the
possible wave and we've been wanting to
do one ever since so we are on our way
to Australia now to do one in Australia
because we wanted to do an international
Squad tour and whitefox approached us
and they said we would love to sponsor
your next squad tour and we were like
hell yes it's gonna be fun to just
travel with the squad again I'm gonna
add a little brow bone highlight and I'm
just gonna use Sue's from the desi Katie
Joseph colors collection onto my brow
bone tied a little much
so into mario's masterclass laura
mercier through a master class for you
know a lot of beauty influencers to go
which is awesome I've always wanted to
see one of his classes I love learning
from other artists I've learned so many
things just by having my makeup done
recently by artists and he pointed out
like when you do a brow bone highlight
to only put it in the very high point of
the eye to lift cuz if you bring it down
it like brings your eye down too so I've
been trying to just like kind of do that
more recently opposed to like I would
take the brow bone highlight all the way
across I thought that was a really good
tip sharing the secrets I'm not gonna
dust off my baking powder yet cuz I
really want to like solidify the shape
that I laid down I'm gonna do a little
wing I'm using my Kat Von D trooper it's
just the best it makes it so easy to
make the wing so I like to use that
liner to line everything and I don't go
in with either my NYC liquid liner and
my Inglot gel liner and fill it in the
reason I do that is because for me I
feel like the English eyeliner is darker
it's like the darkest shade of black
which I like I also feel like the NYC
one's a slightly darker too but I love
the Kat Von D one gives you that good
shape pretty easy peasy so cheesy
a little mascara two-faced mascara so
Thea called me and my aunt
let me FaceTime her it's so funny
facetiming her the way she holds the
phone is really good I
got her an iPhone so that she could call
like all of our family in Mexico and she
didn't have a phone for since I've known
her she like refused to have a cell
phone she thinks that it's gonna like
mess with her brain and one of those
finally this last year she was like I
need a phone and I was really really
surprised and now she facetimes which i
think is hilarious hopefully she answers
yeah
trick or treat what's happening what are
you doing not the puedo yeah I love you
okay good not the quail away say hi I
love you I'll talk to you later okay bye
I love her so much
oh she's just nestled I'm gonna apply
some false lashes these are Lily lashes
and diamond can't really chitchat while
I'm applying lashes very difficult
procedure we're gonna let that dry and
I'm gonna go ahead and contour the nose
hoola bronzer by benefit whoo oh my god
I want to be done by 5:00 if a
trick-or-treater comes to my house I
must be ready okay
I must you guys have said okay every
year I get ready in my costume and I sit
on my couch like just waiting for like a
child to ring my doorbell so I can give
them candy nobody ever comes and then if
I like God forbid I hear a noise I'm
like who's there a kid no let's do here
I am cuz I'm gonna contour my nose
actually let's just off this powder nail
also rounding out my cheeks
I love seeing little girls dressed up as
Selena for Halloween and you know I
don't mind people dressing up as icons
for Halloween because I think it keeps
them alive and it shows how much people
love and adore them I love seeing little
girls because I feel like their family
is like passing on the spirit of that
icon to them and like educating them on
who they were and their that in love
with these people that they want to be
them still and I love that I think it's
so cool seen a lot of icon costumes this
year I'm gonna use my charlotte tilbury
powder just to kind of go over
everything I'm just gonna take my studio
fix powder this is like a really light
shade for me and see 30 kind of
highlight some spots here I look really
powdery right now but once I spray it
all it'll be fine
all around her cheeks more of a button
nose put some black on my lower lashline
smudge that out a little bit you know
I'm gonna add a little highlight on the
cheeks I'm just gonna add a little blush
this is copper tone by Mac and now for
the lip I'm gonna use the melt cosmetics
lip liner and ambrosia Serena had
beautiful pouty lips
oh wow this color is like a lot more
pinky than I thought it would be so
let's switch let's try this la girl lip
liner thought was a really thing I need
more of like a brick this is better this
is um actually an eyeliner by Urban
Decay called
Anatomy I like really overlined my lips
this is a colour-pop ultra matte
lipstick in the shade
now I'm gonna use at the Mac Selena
collab lipstick this is in gonna put
this in the center I
I mean it looks like too big I'm gonna
spray my face with fix+ cuz I got a lot
of powder going on here now for the
finishing touches I'm gonna add my
