kidding
hey boy are you rolling is the camera on
cameras hot all right so I have a few
red carpets coming up
no they excuse me excuse me
you guys boys hello come on come on
leave you can't act like an adult can't
act like adults II gotta go
so right now we're in my closet and I
wanted to do kind of a get ready with me
video talking about like everything I do
to get ready for a big event you guys
could use some of these tips and tricks
towards a wedding or any big event that
you have coming up this is like the kind
of stuff I like to do so let's go here
important face masks this is one that
I've always use you guys always see me
using it was in my skincare video it's
the glam blue gravity mud they came out
with a Sonic the Hedgehog color one
still the same as the silver first
things first you want to apply a face
mask before an event
I wouldn't apply anything too harsh this
is just like a nice face mask and it
helps with radiance of your skin so it's
not anything that super harsh is going
to help you with breakouts any breakout
type of mask I would use a couple of
days before your event just in case it
makes them come up to the surface so
this is more just for radiance and I
like this because right after you take
it off your face looks really glowy and
that's what you want you want to look
nice and glowy look in snatched make
sure you rinse this after a wreath
another thing I like to do before a big
event is whiten my teeth I feel like
that's so important because you're
smiling a lot in your photos and you
want to make sure that they look as
white as they could be I've always been
using the Crest Whitestrips these are
just strips you can buy over the counter
I've used the gentle ones before as well
if you have sensitive teeth gentle works
really well these are the crest 3d white
strips and these actually come with a
light look at my chicken cloth it's good
because you can wear it while you're
doing things right so if you're needing
to try on your outfit for that night or
whatever it may be I like to wear these
as I'm getting ready there's one for
like the top of your teeth and then one
for the bottom this is going to be
really flattering I'm sure you just kind
of boom
all right so now you're going to have a
list and look extra sexy this is awkward
for you Steven not at all okay so you
have it in for an hour and then you can
use the crashed LED light like this I
can't explain and talk at the same time
especially about this look so you're
going to put it on after you've had it
in for an hour and you do it twice one
for the top teeth and one for the bottom
teeth and the light will turn off
automatically when it's done do I look
crazy right now with this blue mask and
this blue light basically what this
light does is it makes your teeth get
the optimal whiteness that they could
possibly be right like if you were to go
to the dentist but this is just
something to get over the counter I like
to do
whitening at home and I'll put it on and
then go on about my business after your
whitening your teeth and face masking
you can like go through your college it
and pick out what you're going to wear I
think I'm gonna wear either this rush or
dish rush to the event should I have I
don't know if you guys want to comment
down below what do you think
whoa
right baseball's quick sidenote another
thing I like to do before events is do a
hair mask I already did one but if you
guys do have an event a hair mask is
gonna make your hair look really good
don't do it the day of I would do it the
day before or the week leading up to
your event because a hair mask has a lot
of moisture and it can make your hair
look a little bit flatter if you do with
the day of so that's a tip um blue if I
was green I would die if I was green Oh
duh after I'm just gonna go ahead and go
peel off this face mask and start on my
makeup so we're about to head into the
studio whoo so we're gonna make moves
now we're going into the makeup room
which is right next door here we go so
this is where I film hello there's Sven
so we're gonna bring you guys right into
this now the tutorial of the makeup and
now we're here in the studio first
things first I'm just going to do every
step that I would to get ready for a big
event here on camera so that includes
skincare I'm going to moisturize my skin
whatever moisturizer you like I'm just
trying out this one by Charlotte Tilbury
it's called the magic cream but you can
use whatever moisturizer you like this
one just works well as a primer from
what I hear in the streets this one does
have sunblock though so I'm not sure how
I would do with flashback of photography
we should all see next time I'm also
gonna use the eye cream these are just
new products that I got that have kind
of been wanting to try out so I
mentioned this in my new skincare video
of things I'm trying right now someone
told me it works really well at helping
plump
your under eyes so that it kind of fills
fine lines so next I'm going in with a
primer this is benefits Porefessional
this is really good if you have larger
pores if you want to fill anything like
that but because it is so thick and it
is to fill pores I only apply it in
areas where the pores appear more
visible which is usually for a lot of
people the apples of the cheeks so I'm
just smoothing that over
and then kind of blending it in around
the edges of where I applied it I went
to Patrick toss makeup seminar if you
guys don't know who Patrick ties he's an
amazing celebrity makeup artist like I
just I love his makeup so much he's one
of my favorites I want him to do my
makeup one day he keeps telling me he's
going to but I'm fading Patrick I know
you're watching and I'm waiting it was
really nice to be educated by another
makeup artist because I find that he's a
whole different type of artist he does a
lot of celebrity work for red carpets
and the makeup for that is a lot
different then you know maybe YouTube or
Instagram and I was so in awe of just
his techniques I was really excited to
go home and try some of his things one
of the things he did was makes a bunch
of different foundations I usually do
that anyways I find that I love to mix
foundations say you like the color of
one and you need another color or if you
like the finish of one but you want to
be a little bit more full coverage just
playing with mixing your foundations can
give you a whole new formula that you
may have not a thought of before for my
foundation I'm going to be using the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk and I'm
going to add a few drops of this
essential oil by Mac it smells like
sweet orange and lavender and so just
gonna give it more of a glow I'm also
gonna mix strobe cream put it all on a
petri dish and blend it together just
like this boom so the majority of the
mixture is going to be the Armani
luminous silk because I just love the
way that looks this is going to kind of
shear out the foundation a little bit
but still have that full coverage so if
you don't want your skin to look too
heavy I love that Patrick was like I
love full coverage foundation because it
makes everyone look really flawless in
photos but I don't want it to look cakey
so you can always thin it out with a
strobe cream and make it look a little
bit more glowy so now I'm just going to
mix it all together I loved going to his
class it was so I just I realized how
much I miss learning about makeup from
other people and I really like that he
has a more you know natural approach to
make up just looking glamorous but still
looking yourself is what I'm trying to
say just using this morphe g34 brush to
kind of distribute the product
everywhere this is definitely not how he
applied foundation but
you know Here I am you have dry skin I
really like adding drops of oils like I
did here I added the Mac one but there's
also an orbital there's also an LC oil
there's a lot of oils out there that you
can add to your foundations I wouldn't
do it if you have an oilier skin type
you have dry skin or combination skin I
feel like it looks really nice just a
couple of drops gives you a really glowy
look you know we love to apply powder to
the center of the face as well so
everything will look glowy but you can
still powder areas that you don't want
to look glowy I just like to use a brush
to put the product on and then I use my
Beauty Blender to blend it out because I
feel like if I dip my Beauty Blender in
there I've noticed that it's been
sucking up extra product I like to spend
a lot of time on the skin it's probably
the most important part for me aside for
my brows the foundation I'm using also
if I didn't already mention it's in the
shade 7.5 you can clearly see that there
is a difference between my face and my
neck so it's very important to bring the
foundation down your neck as well even
onto your ears and you should have kind
of blend it out your Beauty Blender or a
large kabuki brush works really well for
this now it comes time for spot
concealing if you have any breakouts so
you want to make sure to spot conceal
those with something a little bit more
heavy duty I'm going to use a little bit
of this shape tape just on the areas
that blemishes may show through so if
you have any blemishes just use
concealer don't put more foundation on
you want to keep your skin nice and
luminous not too much foundation next
I'm going to use a little bit of it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye this is a
really good concealer for under-eye dark
circles it's super heavy duty I only use
the tiniest drop which I put here and I
don't even use all of that you want to
use a nice synthetic brush for this this
one is by Tarte cosmetics just applying
that in the hollow areas of my under
eyes this is really good as like a base
concealer so I don't really use this too
close to my under eyes I kind of just
like to put
in the hollows here and feather it out
because it's a really thick concealer
okay Wes we're gonna move on to brows
I'm gonna be using this new brow palette
this is by zoeva I said new it already
looks like a hot-ass mess a brow
spectrum palette has a bunch of
different shades here I'm taking an
angled brush this is by Joseph's colors
I'm gonna dip into this shade right over
here we're gonna start shaping up the
brows my aunt sent me a photo of me when
I was a kid and really my brows have
always looked like this so I don't think
it's ever gonna be any different for me
I make it work but still I just I like I
wish I could just wake up and be like I
have brows and I would never do micro
bleeding because I don't know it just
seems like very permanent on my face
scares me and I haven't really heard the
best results of micro bleeding so freaks
me out
I just want a nice soft brow that's like
just framing my face but it's not super
statement like powder is nice because it
has a really soft look to it to just
flick upwards towards the front with the
lightest amount of powder so you can
kind of get the majority of the shape
with the powder and then if you have
more sparse areas like I do here you can
go in with a pencil which has a little
bit more pigment it's gonna look more
like hairs they're gonna go ahead and
set the brows with some clear brow gel
just to make sure they don't move around
I hate when you take photos and there's
like one brow hair dangling so now we're
gonna move on to the eye makeup and it's
gonna be pretty simple actually first
you want to apply an eyeshadow base this
one is by benefit it's the air patrol
when you have an event of course you
want to apply an eyeshadow base because
you want your eyeshadow to last just as
long as your face makeup and that's why
we apply primer to our face as well and
I'm applying this with the same brush
that I used for that concealer making
sure to blend that evenly across the lid
up into the brow bone I'm just going to
go ahead and set that eyeshadow base I'm
going to be using brulee I'm just gonna
lightly dust it over everything you
could use a translucent powder
as well I just like using this because
it highlights the brow bone at the same
time and I'm distributing the product
mostly over the crease and the brow bone
so next we're gonna go into the eye
shadow and like I said this look is
going to be very easy I'm gonna start
off with this morphe r39 blending brush
and I'm gonna go into the Carli bybel BH
Cosmetics palette just because I feel
like this palette is super affordable
and I mean it's like all bronzy tones so
if you have this palette at home it's
really really nice when it go into this
gold shade here apply that all over the
lid softly blending it upwards and
blending it out into the crease as well
but just very lightly whatever's
leftover on my brush I like shimmer
shadows for events because I feel like
they look really pretty under lights and
in photos so once I apply it and then
gonna take a clean blending brush and
diffuse those edges so this is the kind
of look I'm going for right now this is
also makeup done by Patrick and just
love how she looks like a glowing
goddess I'm actually going to go into my
bronzer this is Mac give me Sun and a
Smith to a 3-2 brush and I'm going to
start applying this into the crease for
some more and over here in the outer
corner of the eye
trying to fuse all these colors together
still keeping it really soft now that we
have this really pretty diffused golden
look I'm going to deepen out the outer
corner with tan lines by makeup geek and
love this brush this is the Smith two
four seven and I'm going to apply this
on the outer corner and also in the
outer crease and just blend it into all
the shades we applied on the lid and the
crease this is a really good eye makeup
look for beginners because it's minimal
product you don't have to have like 500
different eyeshadows so getting really
nice and golden I'm gonna go into my
concealer next this is the aqua luminous
perfecting concealers I mixed two colors
so I can't really seem to figure out my
color so a mixing tan and medium I kind
of like tan because it's it's dark it's
almost the same color as my foundation
but I feel like it covers the darkness
under my eye area so I put a little bit
there and next I'm taking medium which
is really light and I'm just gonna apply
it all over in the triangle formation
here I'm also going to sharpen up this
shadow on the edge here because it can
get a little messy over here also
applying it on the sides of my nose boom
all right and I'm gonna go in with the
beauty blender and blend that all out
this concealer isn't super full coverage
so if you need something a little bit
more full I recommend the chart shape
tape this one is really really good it's
gonna cover everything and it also sets
really well so it dries to a matte
finish and it doesn't budge to set the
under eyes I'm using the Kat Von D peach
brightening powder but I'm going to mix
that in with the Laura Mercier
translucent powder just going to set my
under eye with this I dipped the mixture
onto my Beauty Blender and we're just
going to apply it on the under
guys make sure if you get an oily nose
to pack that powder on the sides of your
nose as well and I also bring the powder
down to the apples of my cheeks so this
area is gonna be really powdered because
that's where I get oily but I'm gonna
leave majority of my face nice and dewy
looks kind of crazy right now but we're
gonna dust it off in a second I'm also
going to take that translucent powder
down the center of my nose kind of
laying down a straight line of this let
that settle for a little bit I'm going
to be using the pro concealer by la girl
this is a nice affordable concealer it's
in the shade toast it's a deep shade but
I'm going to use this to contour my
cheekbones boom I'm also gonna apply
that just like little dots around the
hairline to bronze up my face in that
photo
GG is bronze to the gods she looks so
good so I'm going to apply a small
amount and then work that in with my
Beauty Blender it looks kind of crazy
right now but don't worry it'll blend
out this is how you get the rotisserie
look and if you feel like I do and it's
a little bit too crazy you could always
go back in with your foundation and kind
of go over the edges now that everything
is well not everything's blended in but
the bronzer is I'm using my Mac Studio
Fix this is the NC 45 I like to use this
along the sides of my nose to give a
subtle contour it's just easy just like
that boom done done and done now I'm
going to dust off the powder that we
have here so now I'm going to use my
lemare powder and this is what I'm going
to use to kind of set just the center of
my face so now I'm going in with this
highlight this is the Natasha Ginetta
face glow cream shimmer and the shade
zero one light taking that on my Beauty
Blender pinching it together and I'm
going to start applying that to the tops
of my cheekbones and I just want a very
very dewy glow to the skin just like in
the photo so I'm using this cream
for that I'm also taking that on the
Cupid's bow the tip of the nose so now
I'm gonna go right over that cream
highlight with a powder highlight this
is going to intensify it and also set it
and I'm using a Lexi 1:00 to 9:00 fan
brush now I'm going in with my morphe
e36 this is a really good under-eye
brush and the same eyeshadow tan lines
that we used into the outer corner of
the top part of our eye and I'm going to
run this under the lash line so I start
placing my brush on the outer corner of
the eye and then I lightly sweep it in
words that I want most of the product to
be on this outer corner and then connect
it to the top as my inner corner
highlight I'll be using this Natasha -
no - shadow in the color moonshine it's
this one right here this is a little
palette but you can also buy her
eyeshadows individually I'm just gonna
use a pencil brush for that buy it and
then I kind of just blend out the edges
here so now we're going to go ahead and
do our lashes I'm gonna curl them first
little baby lashes and then apply
mascara I'm using the Too Faced this is
the better than sex waterproof formula
then after you apply mascara you could
either apply your favorite strip for
events and especially for weddings
I think individual lashes is best
because say for example you cry and the
corner of your strip lash pops off it's
gonna be an annoying thing to have to
deal with if you aren't good at applying
lashes or if your makeup artist left
whatever it is individual lashes if you
cry one might fall off but it doesn't
mean you lose your whole strip these are
the Ardell I have a pack of medium short
and then these are multi pack you just
dip the top of the lash into the glue
like this and I'm gonna apply a long on
the outer corner first you want to make
sure that your glue that you're dipping
it in your lash glue is tacky because if
it's not it'll just slide around like
it's doing now I'm trying to rush it I'm
going to take another long eyelash and
apply it in the center then I'm going to
apply a medium over here and you're
putting them right on top of the lashes
I like the look where the lashes are
flared on the outside so I put the loans
on the outside if you want all one
length all the way across you could do
that you could
create any style that you want and I
barely have any lashes so I really have
to build going in with the next lash
here I like to put majority of long on
the outer part of my eye then I kind of
go more towards medium for the center
and then small for the inner part of the
eyes that's the look I like again
somewhere we're getting somewhere
I'm going with short into this inner
part of the eye here you already have a
full set of lashes like your natural
lashes are just pop in it's not going to
be as hard for you to do this because
you're not going to need as many lashes
but I'm over here starting from scratch
so this is this is what I have going on
it's a lot easier to use the not free
eyelashes and it is the ones with a not
for some reason my long ones here have a
knot because apparently they're just
sold out of not free everywhere but the
other ones don't and there's so much
easier to use the short and medium don't
have knots and there's so much easier
okay so I've applied the individuals to
both eyes so now I'm going to take this
Maybelline mascara this is the colossal
Big Shot Volume Mascara and I'm gonna
apply just a little bit to the lashes
just to kind of give them that real lash
mascara look but I'm not applying too
much mostly at the base I noticed that
in that photo she didn't really have a
lower lash mascara Gigi but if you want
to apply lower lash mascara this would
be the time alright so we're done with
the eyes I'm just going to finish off
the face we did apply that cream bronzer
earlier but I'm using the give me Sun by
Mac to just kind of set it I don't want
to apply too much because I like the
amount of bronze we got from just using
the cream going into this Oprah this is
the little blush set here I'm going to
do a mixture of this tone right here and
this tone
lightly apply that just know when you
have an event that blushes the first
thing to fade from your makeup it
doesn't last as long so it won't look as
crazy once you get to your event so I
like to apply just a little bit more
when I have an event and then it starts
to fade it's really important to set the
makeup that you've done I'm using the
Urban Decay all nighter they got new
packaging now it's black so doesn't get
all dirty so not only is this going to
set the makeup but it's also going to
make all the powders on your face kind
of melt into the skin so it doesn't look
super powdery or cakey or anything it's
gonna look a lot nicer now for the lips
you guys can go ahead and use any lip
color that you want I'm going to use the
Marc Jacobs yours to try and it's a
really pretty nude color I just love the
photo where it's bronzy and nude
obviously you guys know this is what I
like but you guys can do bright red any
color goes with this makeup look I
absolutely love this lipstick this isn't
a lipstick that dries super matte it
just wears comfortably on your lips okay
so this is the finished look it's really
pretty it's soft it's monochromatic it's
very bronze II and nude and golden and
everything I love in a makeup look
alright so that's it for the video I'm
all ready to go well I'm not ready to go
yet I'm still wearing my sweater and
sweatpants down here but you know what I
mean I really like how this makeup look
turned out I hope you guys do too it's
actually one of my favorites crazy how
just some different techniques could
make the makeup look better and more
effortless so thank you patrick Toph for
sharing your techniques with me to me
this look is so effortless and so
beautiful and glowy everything I love in
a makeup look so thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye and I'm just going to plop one
we went a little more than one drop
there
that oh now it's very important to set I
just can't handle this air right now
