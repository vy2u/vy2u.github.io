today I wanted to film a look for you
guys that is basically a mash-up of a
few things that you guys have requested
a lot of you guys have been asking me to
do a look for beginners or maybe
somebody who's just starting out doing
makeup so that I look on this is so easy
you guys it's simple anyone can do it it
just enhances your eyes I really wanted
to focus on skin in this video show you
guys kind of like my out my updated skin
routine as far as foundation and how I
do everything just to get that nice glow
this is a video kind of mashing up all
of those things and then at the end I
actually decided to show you guys how to
get this really quick easy messy
fishtail braid so that's a mouthful I
don't even know what to name this video
hopefully I named it something good so I
hope you guys enjoy this video and let's
get started but since I really wanted to
focus on skin in this tutorial I'm going
to going do I have an accent out of a
sudden I'm going to use this be fine
food and skincare moisturizer just
before I apply any makeup to my face and
this has SPF 15 so it's going to protect
you a bit from the Sun and it also has
like some anti-aging properties so I
mean as you guys can see like I
definitely have imperfections right now
I'm breaking out I have like some
breakouts that are trying to go away but
they're definitely fixable I always
apply a lip balm before I do the rest of
my makeup just so by the time you get to
your lipstick it's nice and moisturized
and you don't have those dry cracked
lips so I'm going to be using the pixi
tinted brilliance balm and this is going
to protect and hydrate your lips and
then like I said it's going to make it
nicer later when you want to apply your
lipstick today I'm going to use the
hello flawless foundation and I'm going
to apply a few pumps of this to the back
of my hand and then I'm going to take my
Beauty Blender go ahead and Pat that on
actually it probably helps better if you
want to use less foundation I don't know
why I did it that way but if you want to
use less product put it onto your face
first with your fingers like this
and then blend in the foundation with
the Beautyblender I don't know why I did
it the other way I also want to bring it
down to your neck just to kind of blend
it down if you wonder why I'm looking
that way it's because that's where my
screen is so that I can see what I'm
doing I don't even have a mirror in
front of me right now that's how I roll
I don't need a mirror probably do need a
mere actually my blended I can't even
see okay let me grab a mirror the trick
to skin that doesn't look cakey is
applying a very thin layer of foundation
all over and then you really want to
target the areas that you need a little
bit more coverage in instead of using
full coverage over your whole face so
I'm going to go in with the motives
color perfecting quad and this is in the
shade medium and I've been loving this
lately X actually why do I have an
accent
out of nowhere I'm going to go over my
blemish and just kind of pop that
product on there put this around my nose
I'm going to use my Beauty Blender again
and just kind of press that into the
skin very lightly you want to apply a
powder that's going to take away any
oiliness so I tend to get oily in this
area right here city color be matte
mineral block powder I'm just going to
pop that on my nose and I'm using a Mac
168 brush the next thing I'm going to do
is bronze up my skin just to give you a
nice tan bronzer it's actually a
mineralized skinfinish from mark it's
called give me Sun and I've absolutely
been loving it because it's really warm
and it kind of is perfect for just
giving you a tan like a fake tan just
swirl my brush in there and you want to
kind of put it where you would contour
but you're not going to do it you're not
going to contour or target areas really
sharply you're just going to want to
lightly blend it along your cheekbones
and then up to your temples as well kind
of along your hairline and pull it down
so my next step is really sharpening
this contour here so I'm going to use a
little bit on a small contour brush this
one is by Bellamy going to really find
the hollow of my cheek
phone and just apply it right in there
it's going to give you that sharp
cheekbone it's time to apply your
concealer pick up your favorite
concealer I'm actually just going to
keep using this motives foundation quad
and I'm just going to use the light
shade and I'm going to apply that under
the eyes just going to my finger for
this you can definitely do this step
after your foundation before you contour
or any of that but I messed up using
your finger helps the product really
melt into your skin so now that you've
applied your cream concealer you're
going to want to go ahead and set that
so I'm going to use the bare minerals
well rested powder and I apply the
product where I have these kind of bags
right here any shadows really that's
where you want to apply the bright any
brightening products so you guys can see
how that instantly brightened my
under-eye and it just looks so much
nicer
so by brightening this area it's also
going to make your contour and bronzer
stand out even more so I'm going to pick
up this blush called copper tone with my
Mac 168 brush and I'm just going to
apply that to the apples of the cheeks
this blush isn't too bright it's kind of
like a little bit of a warm bronzer and
because I want this look to be worn with
any lip color I really want it to be
subtle we're going to use our
highlighter so you guys know I love Mac
whisper of guilt I use it all the time
it's my absolute favorite however I know
it's limited edition so a lot of you
guys can't get your hands on it and I
almost make and it makes me feel bad
using it cuz I know that it's not
available so I've been on a mission to
find another highlighter that I love and
I actually recently tried this a
highlighter by city color and it comes
in this blush highlight and bronzer trio
like this and I'm going to put that on
the high points of my face so do you
guys see this highlight right now city
color is a brand that have recently been
introduced to and it's so affordable got
put
too much to be honest but it's ok you
just blend it up do you guys see that
highlight you also want to apply
highlighter to your Cupid's bow and I
always put a little bit of highlighter
on the tip of my nose so right here kind
of accentuate the Cupid's bow then I
take my finger and kind of blend it away
a little bit because you don't want to
be too cry crying you know then I'm
going to take a little bit and also
apply that onto the nose do the same
thing blend it out with your finger I
can't get over that highlight alright
guys so the eyes are going to be so
simple like I said I usually do a really
intense eyebrow but today I want to just
keep it really natural and if you have
full brows I wouldn't even do a lot of
filling in I would just run a brow gel
through it but because I was not blessed
hunger I was not blows using a brow
pencil this is tarts emphasize eye I
think it's like medium brown or
something like that what I've been doing
lately is using this Mac brow gel it's
called a girl boy and it's a tinted brow
gel it's going to make your eyebrows
lighter in color so what I like to do is
take off most of the product off the
wand and then I lightly run this through
my brows all the difference between the
color of my brow this is way lighter
matches my hair a little bit better this
is my natural brow color it's really
dark going to go in with this cream
eyeshadow by Tarte and it's called
shimmering bronze and I'm just going to
take a flat concealer brush and I'm
going to apply this to the lids so after
I applied it with my flat brush I'm
literally taking my finger and I'm going
to blend this out like just going to
kind of because you don't want it to be
super bright you kind of just want it to
be a nice wash across the lid so I'm
using a gold color
and I'm taking this with a pencil brush
this is the Mac 219 applying that in the
inner part of the eye you know what guys
I kind of decided that I want my lid to
be a little bit lighter but I'm going to
put this color by motives it's called
vintage glam over it I just want to put
that over the eyeshadow base and take a
blending brush and just blend out those
edges that same eyeshadow base that you
use the Tarte one and you can run that
under the lash line really lightly just
to give a little bit of definition if
you guys have really long eyelashes then
this is the last step for the eyes but I
don't have long eyelashes I have very
tiny eyelashes but I'm going to go ahead
and apply benefits they're real mascara
and I love this mascara because it's
super black and it doesn't smudge so
those are pluses for me I'm going to be
applying these falsies from flutter
lashes and they are really pretty they
are the new lashes for Scott Barnes by
flutter lashes what a difference
eyelashes make to your eyes like how
much more open this eye is then this one
so once you have either applied a few
coats of mascara or apply to your lashes
then you are done with the eyes super
easy I really wanted to show you guys a
makeup look that you could wear with a
ton of lip colors for the summer so I'm
going to show you guys a few of my
favorites for the summer
the guy's a zigg a zigg
okay so along with this really simple
makeup I also want to show you guys a
quick hairstyle in my Ipsy bag this
month I got this marrakech ends argan
hump and oil therapy so I'm going to use
that because I use so much bleach and
this is going to control the frizz and
it's also going to seal and repair split
ends so I'm going to go ahead and take a
small amount and apply this to my ends
going to pull all my hair to the side
because I want to do a fishy fishy oh my
gosh I want to do a messy fishtail braid
so want a lot of textures I want this
look to be really messy so I'm going to
use my sexy hair of a beach spray and
this is like a texturizing Beach spray
so it's going to create that undone
texture that we want oh I'm going to
spray oh go to my mouth grab both split
it in half I actually have an in-depth
video on how to create a fishtail braid
and I will link that in this description
box you're going to take one side pull
it back and add it to this section and
then you're going to take one section
from one small section from this side
and add it to this section creating an X
so as you can see it's very messy grab a
piece from this section pull it over to
the other one and then grab it from this
section pull it over to the other one
the smaller you make the pieces the
better your braids going to look and
this look looks really nice when you
have extensions because you can make it
really or if you have long hair I mean I
have medium length hair but if you have
extensions you can make it extra fluffy
I'm almost done so if you choose to do
smaller section clear sections it
obviously takes a little bit more time
now what you want to do is start pulling
these little
pieces out just to make your braids a
little bit oops that one went a little
too far I like this look too if you have
dirty hair and you don't know what to do
with it because it's dirty you can do
something like this that's it
that is your look I hope you guys
