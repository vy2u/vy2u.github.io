for today's video we're going to be
doing a super dramatic smoky eye I saw
this photo that I was actually really
inspired by on Instagram I don't know if
it's an artist or it just looks like a
jewelry store or something but I saw the
photo and I was like oh my god I need to
do that this makeup is beautiful it's
glossy I didn't want to put gloss so I
used an eyeshadow that might look a
little bit more shiny for you guys so
you could wear it out and not worry
about creasing I was so inspired by that
photo that I was like I gotta film it
ASAP so I really hope that you guys
enjoy it and if you want to learn how to
get this makeup look keep on watching so
I'm doing a really extreme makeup look
where you're going to be applying a lot
of makeup you want to make sure to
exfoliate this is the brightened up
exfoliant from Vasanti it's gonna give
you a nice clean surface for your
foundation application this is also
really good for skin prep it's a
hydrating mask by EPSA she's going to
give you a nice glowing look for today's
makeup application so I'm just showing
you guys on my hand is an example
obviously because I don't have a sink
nearby right here in front of my filming
stuff but this is the texture of this
face mask so the first thing we're going
to do is prime the lids I'll be using
the air patrol by benefit and this is a
sigma precision round brush next i'm
going to take Blanc and this is from mac
cosmetics and I'm just going to use this
to set the base real quick this is the
luxe e and JD brush this is actually a
contour brush but I like to use this
fluffy side for multiple things I'm
going to concentrate this on the crease
and up on the brow bone not so much on
the lid because we want the lid to be
so next I'm going to use this cool tone
brown and this is beware by Urban Decay
the shape of this eyeshadow you wanted
to be really big and really round so
tilting my head back so that I could see
the socket bone a little better
I'm lightly pushing it back and forth to
create a nice round shape and I'll be
using the Real Techniques brush I get
203 and then we're going to keep
building want to take it in under the
brow bone even in the inner corner here
this is gonna be a dramatic smoky eye I
just started following a lot more
colorful Instagram accounts people who
love to do more colorful makeup looks I
know it doesn't look like it in this
tutorial but I've been really inspired
by different color combinations that I
just saw a photo that made me want to do
this makeup look so that's why I'm doing
this one first been so inspired by a
lick just creative people who do such
crazy color combos so going into the
meet matte nude palette I'm going to
take matte wood which is another cold
tone Brown it's just a little bit deeper
it's going to be a lot of blending in
this tutorial I'm using the same Real
Techniques brush and I'm just going to
apply that eye shadow right below where
we applied that color and start to layer
it into the crease
so next I'm going to take a black
eyeshadow with a Luxy to 1/3 which is a
smaller blending brush and I'm going to
focus this mostly on the eye socket
really as close to the crease and right
below the crease deepen that up Luxy
brush works really well for this kind of
work because it's fluffy enough to blend
out everything really well and it has
like a dense enough point to get right
into the socket and as I'm doing this
I'm not even moving my arm just the
wrist to even show the flick of the
wrist flick of the wrist see that not
even moving the arm
so next I'm picking up color pops cream
gel liner and sorb what I want to do
first is just run this along the lash
line and it doesn't have to be neat
because we're going to be covering this
but you just want to make sure that you
saturate the area with black between the
lashes and your lid so we have so we
don't have any gaps you could also use
this to tightline the eyes as well we're
going to go over this so don't worry if
it's not perfect so the lid color I'm
looking for is like a topi bronze shade
and I can't really figure out what to
use so I'm just going to mix to color
pop eyeshadows this one over here on the
right is hammered this one it's a little
bit topi and then this one's really
bronze which is on the rocks I'm going
to mix those two together to kind of get
the color that I'm going for
I hope I don't regret my decision
okay I'm actually trying something
different on the other eye really quick
just to see if it looks better this is
makeup geeks utopia and I'm just if it
does look better then I'll just take the
other one off if not then I'll just
layer it better so I'm going to I'm
going to take off the lid on this this
eye and just apply utopia by makeup geek
and I wet the brush so that it was a
little bit more metallic II
control-alt-delete
control-alt-delete alright I'm not going
to go too close to the blacks I'm not
about to mess up my blending it's just
taking the lid off a little bit I'm
going to go in and fix the damages real
quick just layer over that alright just
like it never happened it's okay if you
have fallout because we don't have our
foundation on yet so so before we finish
the eyes I want to do the foundation and
concealer so that way when we do the
lower lash line the concealer is already
set and done I'm gonna be using my hello
flawless by benefit and this is in the
shade of beige pretty sure I need to get
a shade Tanner than this for summer just
because my body starting to tan a little
bit more so I'm just going to go ahead
take that on the beauty blender and
start applying the foundation I decided
to mix that foundation with the NARS all
day luminous weightless foundation
because this is a little bit more tan
this is in the shade Syracuse so I just
mixed this with the benefit want to tan
it up because I wanted to make sure I
match my neck I want the skin for this
look to be a little bit more luminous
and healthy because the eye is so strong
and intense I feel like it's going to
look good with really glowy skin so next
I'm going to apply my concealer and this
is Born This Way natural radiant
concealer by Too Faced cosmetics it's
going to brighten up these and as this
isn't the shade medium I'm going to set
the concealer using the Kat Von D shade
and light palette and I like to mix
these two colors this more peachy one
neutralizes and then this light one is
just brightening and I'm using a morphe
so to highlight my cheekbones I'm going
to be using one of my favorite cream
highlights this one is by G wave and it
came in the Ipsy glam bag this month
so if you guys got this it's really
really good it's the tra cream highlight
so it's a nice champagne gold and I'm
just applying that with my finger
so I want that luminous look so creams
are really nice next I'm using the Tarte
highlight in expose and I'm just gonna
take that with my finger and highlight
the tip of the nose and the Cupid's bow
so sticking with creams I'm going to be
using this you a cream foundation and
almond I use this deeper shade to
contour or bronze up the skin and I'm
applying that on a flat contour brush by
dose of colors so we're gonna take the
Beauty Blender and really soften that up
because I don't want like an extreme
highlight extreme contour I want it to
be really soft so next we're gonna apply
a little bit of blush I personally don't
want to use cream blush for this just
because cream blushes sometimes fade a
little bit too much and because this
look is so dramatic I don't want it to
fade so I'm gonna use a powder blush
Elizabeth Mott show me your cheeks peach
pink blush this is gonna give us like a
really nice healthy glow not too
over-the-top
so picking up beware by Urban Decay run
that on the lower lash line I'm using a
Mac two-to-one brush so now we're going
back into the darker Brown from the meat
matte nude palette and smoking the lash
line even further I want to connect the
shadow from the top to the lower lash
line as well over here in this corner
and then keep that blending brush at
hand so you could really buff out the
edges too now I'm taking an even tinier
brush this is the Smith - one - and this
is just going to go right under the
waterline with a black eye shadow now
this is a really good brush to get that
detail work under the waterline take it
all the way in I'm sorry if I am
blocking I have to get really close
because I can't be getting black eye
shadow in my eye going back into the
colour-pop liner we're going to line our
waterline real quick
but that's sexy eyeliner face go
yeah that's right girl so next I'm going
with mascara and this one is by juice a
and it's the boombastic lash volumizing
mascara so you're just going to give
your lashes a nice coat of this because
we're going to be applying some falsies
next is the lashes and I'll be using
House of lashes Iconix what a surprise
these are just the only ones that really
show up on my eyes with this type of
dramatic look know where my tweezers are
like to use tweezers usually seen I'm
saying he just looks so good sometimes
if the length of the band itself not not
the length of the lash hairs the band is
too long you want to measure to your eye
first and then cut a bunch off if you
have bigger eyes sometimes you don't
have to do that but my eyes I have to a
little cry see crazy I like to give my
lashes a little push upwards
after I'm done just so they're nice and
lifted so I did highlight with the G way
to give myself the dewy look but I want
to make it a little bit more glossy in a
way so I'm using the delectable cake
beauty everything balm this is basically
a balm that you can use anywhere you
could use it on your lips or you could
use it on top of your cheekbones to make
it pop a little bit more so for the lips
I'm going to be using the NYX lip cream
in London I don't want to use a lip
liner because I don't want it to be
super defined so for the center of the
lips I'm just going to apply a little
bit of a gloss to kind of pout it up
this is the be a bombshell POW in and
secret just going to have a nice little
shine right to the center the last
product I got in my bag is from 12
Benefit just an instant repair treatment
for your hair it says it will smooth and
improve texture and manageability ooh
smells delectable all right guys so this
is it for this makeup tutorial I want it
to be really dramatic and intense and
that's exactly how it came out I really
