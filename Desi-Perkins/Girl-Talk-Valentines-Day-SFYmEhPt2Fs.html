you highlight my day some guy came up to
me and said you will sweep like a mango
one guy who I thought it was really cute
and made me like him his like opener was
if you could have one magical power what
would it be
so I went with teleport mexican-themed
you should not eat probably buffalo
wings that's gonna be a mess you're
gonna have like the sauce all your
fingers and again like anything like
stinky or like really pungent food that
has like garlic or like Benihana
anything that give me gas bad breath if
they didn't offer to pay I hate stingy
guys what is that
I don't know I think it's disgusting and
that it should be outlawed long as
you're not like making out tonguing in
my face but if it's like full like
makeout session and everything you're
all getting into it and you're whether
really it's like no just take that
somewhere else ronaldo cristiano Rolando
is not that super hot it was Paul Walker
rest in peace
this is a very difficult question for me
because Paul Walker was nice about he
push I like Brad Pitt like about 20
years ago oh I like Shia LaBeouf and I
like um Joseph gordon-levitt hey I'm
gonna say Ryan Gosling because I hate I
hate dating actually because it's
awkward I'm just like the queen of
awkward like my awkward like fills the
car and like you can't breathe a dream
date with probably be on a cruise to the
Caribbean a little bit much for a date
but I don't I want to go going to Hawaii
and being on the beach a dream date
would be no date I usually when I told
my son I'm like Jay and come for dinner
hi I'm Eric ha I've had a sick so I
found actually worse right now oh yeah
Oh No
oh my husband let's go with what's cool
with George Clooney fifteen years ago
maybe the rock I wonder what he would
actually do for me on a first date Paul
Walker I should say my husband okay my
husband
listen and communication
be yourself be robust who you are be
honest because if that person will like
you for you then they're not worth the
time be yourself and not be too nervous
to bring your own car so you can leave
when I'm so shady</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
