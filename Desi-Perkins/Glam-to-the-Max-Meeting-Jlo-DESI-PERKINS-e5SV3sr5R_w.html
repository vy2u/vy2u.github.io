today's videos gonna be a makeup
tutorial on this look right here I was
actually doing my makeup for fun the
other night sometimes I like to sit down
and do my makeup just without filming it
because it's therapeutic for me and I
posted the photo of it and you guys
loved it and I also wanted to recreate
the look that I wore when I went to go
see JLo I kind of just morph the two
looks together since they were both
bronzy looks I don't want to put them
like up back-to-back because I already
get called out for doing too many bronzy
looks you guys don't follow me on
snapchat which you should I went to go
work with Kohl's and JLo in Vegas and it
was a dream an absolute dream I'm gonna
talk about it for a second if you guys
want to skip to the tutorial I'll
timestamp it but if you want to hear how
it went meeting JLo then just keep
watching so I flew out to Vegas and they
set up a session to get us all styled
with JLo stylist Rob he was awesome so
he was fitting us in all of the JLo and
Kohl's collection I wasn't really
mentally prepared for JLo to walk in
that day because we weren't supposed to
meet her till the next day I guess
Stephen and everybody knew about it they
were keeping it from us and the minute
she walked in I didn't notice her until
I heard her voice and she was right in
front of me and she's all hey what's up
I'll never forget what I said I was like
don't do this to me I said don't do this
to me because I wasn't mentally prepared
and I wasn't ready and I just like
couldn't take it cuz I was so excited
she gave me the big hug and there's a
photo of me hugging JLo and you just see
my face and my creepy ass like tales of
the Crypt hands like just hugging her
like this and my face is like this she
was wearing like a t-shirt and her body
looked tone like that literally a loose
t-shirt but I still saw the tone in her
body I talked to her about fact that she
wore my key sunglasses and she was
really just like inspirational and sweet
and then we got to go see her perform at
her show in Vegas and it was just like
one of the best performances I've ever
seen I'll put a few clips of it here
I don't think I could like her more but
then after I saw it I was like how is it
possible like I just respected her so
much more we got to go backstage and see
like her dressing room and she had
photos of her as Selena and I thought
that was so cool it was a great
experience I just had the time of my
life Steven said he hasn't seen me smile
that much in a long time like my face
was beaming you know it's just like this
little time this is so cool like it's
crazy that my job like brought me to
meet somebody that I admire so much that
like I would have never thought back in
the day that I'd be working with her I
mean it's crazy to think like yeah I was
working with JLo and couldn't wrap my
brain around the fact that I would have
never thought that and then Here I am it
was all in all just like such a great
experience was one of those things in my
life that like I'll never forget because
I've always looked up to her people
always tell me we look alike which is
one of the biggest compliments you guys
could give me you guys always tell me
that I actually have a picture of her
and I together that is almost creepy
because we ended up kind of smiling the
same it's crazy
it was awesome it was really really cool
I had such a great experience anyways I
think that's everything about the
experience that I was going to talk
about I know a lot of you wanted to hear
about it so that's kind of like the
rundown oh and before we get started I
wanted to mention that I will be at gem
VT New York since a lot of you guys are
asking me on Twitter I hope to see you
guys there if you haven't bought tickets
I do have a 40% off code it'll leave
right over here if you guys are
interested in getting tickets its
September 17 through 18 maybe I'll see
you guys there so anyways this is a
makeup tutorial so we're just gonna go
ahead and get started with the tutorial
I've already primed my face with the new
LC pearl radiance primer and then I
quickly applied a layer of the NARS
weightless luminous foundation just with
my hands we're just going to move on to
the eyes I'm using the benefit Air
Patrol as the eyeshadow base I also did
this eye off camera because I always do
this eye off-camera adjusted it before
hand I'm just gonna apply this base onto
the lid with the flat Urban Decay brush
and then I'm going to work my way up to
the brow bone you want to make sure to
get a nice even layer all across the eye
I like this eye shadow base because it's
not like a super light color I blend it
out really nice and sheer so that
the eye shadow peeks through it still
looks like skin underneath it's not like
super super light when I want to do more
natural looks for these kinds of looks
it's fine to have something like soft
ochre painterly but when it comes to you
know more natural looks where I want to
have a light eyeshadow I love this
eyeshadow base using the morphe 35o
palette it looks like this lots of warm
tones I take the lightest color in the
palette which is this matte bone shade
right over here means that to highlight
my brow bone and also bring it down into
the crease this is pretty standard with
all my makeup looks I always like to set
the eyeshadow base with a bone colored
eyeshadow and then also highlights the
brow bone so you start applying the most
color right under the brow bone because
that is where you want it to be the
lightest that's where you want the lift
in your eyes that's where you want the
highlight but then whatever is left over
that's what you drag into the crease I
don't know what happened to my brow
today in this region we had a little
difficulty if you will next I'm taking a
Mac two to four old-school blending
brush this was always my transition
brush back in the day and I'm going into
this orange shade here this is going to
be my transition shade I'm laying this
down first and it's also going to be the
shade that gets blown out the most start
in the crease but then take it up above
the crease we're gonna really layer
eyeshadows today because this look is
all about blending very tedious but it
looks so good after if you want to put
in the time it'll look really good keep
this brush nearby this brush is going to
be really helpful to blend throughout
the rest of your makeup look next I'm
picking up this blending brush by Real
Techniques it's 203 brush we're going to
go into this nice warm toned Brown over
here this color is going to be the next
shade that shows so it's going to be a
gradient from the first color to a
darker color to a darker color I'm
laying down the color with my brush this
way to get a really really dense line
right in the
the shape that we made here then to
blend it out even more it's always nice
to hold your brush up this way and
that's because these bristles right down
here well blend out the crease for you
basically
realistically I spend about five minutes
blending in this dark color because as
the shades get darker I spend more time
making sure that everything is really
nice and blended next I'm going to go
into this rich chocolate brown right
over here in the corner and I'm using a
Smith two-three to brush I love a Smith
brushes they are probably my favorite
blending brushes right now which is
crazy because up until this time like
Mac 217 was my favorite but they
definitely are better this is going to
go right on top and deepening up once
again it's okay if you get it on the lid
because we're going to cover the lid
anyways try not to but it's okay if you
do and also take it on this outer V part
of the eye too
so once I laid it down that dark dark
brown I'm going back into the Real
Techniques brush that I use it the
lighter brown with and I'm going to buff
out those edges and really smooth
everything out don't worry about getting
eye shadow when you are over here
because you can clean that up afterwards
your concealer
the one thing that palette does not have
as a black eyeshadow so I'm using Mac
carbon for this I've been used this one
and so long this used to be one of my
favorite black eyeshadows to use and I
really like the luck c22 7 because it's
like a really thin flat almost blending
brush so if you want to get like a
precise line like this black over here
this is a good one for that and this is
of course gonna be the lowest shade that
we lay down
I'm almost putting this in the crease
but then a little bit underneath it as
well and the reason I'm putting it a
little bit underneath is because so you
have to adjust this to your eye crease
mine folds in when my eyes look straight
so I kind of have to place it right here
in order for it to just be black in the
crease just gonna put that in there
blend it out it's gonna keep dipping in
and blending this in and of course after
laying down black I'm going back into
the Real Techniques brush that we laid
down the shade right after the
transition shade which was the lightest
Brown and I'm just gonna buff those
edges out when I buff out any edges I do
it with a really really soft soft hand
so you don't want to interrupt the
eyeshadow too much just like a little
bit in when I use metallic or shimmery
eyeshadows I love to use a flat
concealer brush and I love to dampen the
brush before using the metallic
eyeshadow because it just makes a little
bit more vibrant I'm using setting spray
you could use fix+ you could even just
use water eyedrops whatever you got I'm
going to go into this bronze shade right
over here this nice metallic bronze it's
kind of more of a topi Tobi bronze and
with that we're gonna apply that to the
lid and also carve the crease so as you
can see I got a shadow on the lid but
this is the time where you take that
flat concealer brush
is why I like a flat concealer brush
because it's more dense so you can get a
sharper line than something that has
bristles that are fluffy and they're
just going to be like flailing around
all over your lid you want something
nice and dense so that you can carve out
and clean up the crease and when your
brush is wet with the metallic eyeshadow
to also help you carve it out as well so
for the Instagram picture I just applied
this shadow without the glitter so this
is how it looked on the Instagram pic
just this bronzy taupe shade you could
leave it just like this but I wanted to
add some glitz I added a little glitter
so stop now if you just want to keep it
like this after I lay down the base
color on the lid I always go back in
with the blending brush that I use in
the crease and give it a few more blends
just so that the eyeshadow on the lid
kind of seamlessly blends into the
crease and it's not just like a harsh
line because it's not really what we're
going for
I'm not going for that harsh line we
wanted to kind of blend mesh into the
other eye shadows smokey so now we're
gonna go in with the glitter this is
Urban Decay Midnight Cowboy best glitter
for the eyes out there and it's nice
because it's like a liner you have nice
control over it and and I just want like
more of a scattered glittered look it's
hard to see on camera but it starts to
give you that wet effect the lid when
the lid looks wet and then I like to do
one thin layer before I do the liner and
then if I do the liner and I feel like
there's gaps you go back in so we're
gonna start with that thin layer so next
for liner we're gonna use Inglot gel
liner this is my favorite and I like to
also use the inglot duraline drops you
just put one drop in any gel liner
product it doesn't have to be the Inglot
gel liner but brow gels um like brow
pomade or anything that's in a pot that
has a tendency to dry out this kind of
just like revives it and you just put
one drop and mix it in onto your brush
it's gonna make your eyeliner
application so much smoother a liquid
and a gel having a baby that's what kind
of kind of makes it I'm using a Mac 263
brush I'm just gonna start the end of my
lash line here so once you make the line
outwards I'm just gonna flip and make
the line back just like that now you
fill it in it's a long wing this is the
kind of wing you wear when you just want
to tell people not to mess with you you
know they know you're a bad bitch when
you have a wing like this now I applied
a little bit of mascara and I'm gonna
apply a false lash this is queen bee by
Koko lashes mmm give it to me
so before we finish off the lower lash
line I like to do my concealer first so
that all the lower lash line shadow
blends into the concealer I'm gonna be
using of course my favorite NARS creamy
concealer I'm going to use bisque this
is a little bit more of a salmon toned
to cancel out darkness oh crap my Beauty
Blender isn't here then I'm gonna go in
with ginger which is you know my shade
also I like to take my concealer and
sharpen up under the wing thank you
blend out
once you apply your concealer you can
see like it makes the look just pop
everything starts to look brighter
cleaner changes up the game and to set
the under eyes I will be using this is
the RCM a powder actually came up on
this cuz macdaddy left it at the shoot
we did together he said I could have it
so I've been using it I really really
like it oh yeah I didn't update you guys
on the cap on deep um setting powder I
like don't know how I feel about the
finish it was like a little bit too
sparkly I had like some sparkles not
sparkles but it had like a sheen that I
wasn't really um wasn't really working
for me on an everyday basis when I do my
makeup I don't always do this this
baking thing just sometimes this is my
favorite brush to dust away powder under
the eye and it's the tapered highlighter
f-35 by Sigma bomb this is everything
has a little tapered point that gets
into those creases those unfortunate
fine lines
and you can get into that inner corner
got a dust everything away whatever's
left over my brush all go over the
center of my forehead my nose and then
my chin I don't like to powder too much
so we're gonna go ahead and finish off
the eyes and then end with the rest of
the face so now I'm gonna take a liner
brush this one is my Maybelline oh this
is the best eyeliner I've ever tried
creamy dark I swear I've picked up like
some high-end eyeliners and I'm like
like it's not working it's not working
but this one's so bomb it's the best one
I've ever tried Maybelline lasting drama
waterproof gel pencil this is bomb this
is the shade sleek onyx so you want to
take this and we're gonna really heavily
apply it to the outer corners of the
eyes do you see how easy that goes on in
dark like damn so I'm taking the light
brown and the orange that we used in the
crease just going to soften it up a
little bit and I'm also taking a little
bit of that black eyeshadow and setting
the liner as well I want it to be smoky
and dramatic
this is the best pencil brush of life
and I have two of them so that I could
use black on one and then I'm going back
into the orange and the brown blending
out right under that except for the
inner corner highlight I'm going to mix
this golden shade with a s'more
champagne shade I'm going to say so I'm
just gonna put that in the inner corners
and now it's time to bronze up the skin
I'll be using my girl Lane bronzer in
shade oh five this bronzer is nice
because it just kind of bronzes
everything up quickly and I'm just going
to start swirling the bronzer into the
hollows of the cheeks a little bit
across the nose just to kind of give an
all-over tan and then of course around
the hairline all over the forehead
except this center part you want to keep
light still when I'm doing a bronzy look
I love to have like an all-over bronze
with the matte bronzer and then an
all-over glow with something like gold
deposit by Mac or betty lou manizer by
the balm is also a good one so I like to
swirl the brush in there and lightly run
this
over the same areas that we applied the
bronzer you guys know I like to you know
put a shoulder highlight when I take my
photos because if your face is glowing
and your body is not it's like a really
big disconnect so I like to put it
everywhere so now it's time to highlight
my favorite part using laura geller
gilded honey this is one of my favorite
highlights and the new Sigma strobing
fan brush so the first time I'm using
this brush whew
this brush is like the perfect size it's
like a mini fan brush oh yes it fits
right on the cheekbones get that nice C
shape going blush i'll be using excite
by Illamasqua just a very little amount
because this is a potent blush see I
already went too much lastly for the
lips I'll be using uncensored by artist
couture this is like a really really
pretty nude gloss but it's pigmented
just going to do a sheer layer of this
get the lips nice and juicy so on top of
that I'm going to be using the jus a
skinny dip lip topper this stuff is like
boom metallic it's like sparkly so
pretty you want to set your face with
setting spray even though I'm about to
take it off anyways and go to sleep
just latest weather I don't know why I'm
even setting my makeup to be honest I'm
not going anywhere
alright guys so that is it for the
tutorial this is the finished makeup
