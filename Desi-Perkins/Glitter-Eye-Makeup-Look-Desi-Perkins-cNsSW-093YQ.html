for today's tutorial we're going to be
doing this look right here this look is
super fun and festive I would wear this
out to Vegas or if it was my birthday
night or something where I just wanted
to stand out a little bit more maybe
like a bachelorette night or you know I
just really gets super girly and sparkly
and just fun so if you guys are
interested in this makeup look then go
ahead and keep on watching I've already
applied my foundation I use the Armani
luminous silk and I have done my
eyebrows and applied my soft ochre as my
base I'm just gonna set my base using
the shadow it's cream bionis dasya
Beverly Hills I just want you guys to
know that I'm 100% winging my makeup
today I don't know if I told you guys
that I recently moved and my life has
been in shambles so I'm trying to get my
you know my stuff together so the next
thing I'm gonna do is take my morphe
blending brush this is my favorite
blending brush it's the m4 for one and
I'm just gonna go into this NARS a
shadow this is in the shade Persia and
I'm gonna pop that into the crease I'm
not gonna be shy with my eye shadow
today I'm going all out I think
I'm gonna take my Milani liquid eye
pencil and this is in the shade of brown
and I'm gonna apply this to my lid as a
base this is a super creamy eyeliner so
it's perfect for this kind of stuff
because it's easy to blend out certain
eyeliners are not as blendable so if you
put them on your lid it's like too rough
I'm gonna go ahead and take this makeup
geek brush it's the smokey eye brush and
I'm gonna try to blend this out so now
I've packed on this base color and it
looks kind of messy at the moment but
we're gonna blend it out with an eye
shadow and pack this on over it I'm
using my NARS Galapagos eyeshadow which
I have been loving lately and I'm just
going to go ahead and pack this all over
I haven't done my concealer yet
so if I have fall out it's not a big
deal I'm actually going to pick up that
galapagos eyeshadow on this zoeva two
three one brush and I'm just going to
start buffing that into the crease and
really connecting the orange to the
brown
these NARS eyeshadows are so nice and
really blendable like I feel like I'm
barely having to do anything the pigment
is just really nice now I'm taking a
clean blending brush this is just my Mac
217 and I'm gonna do windshield wipers
through these two colors and kind of
really blend them together and you want
to make sure to use a clean brush when
you do this because you don't want to
get any of the dark eyeshadow all over
the orange you kind of just want to
nicely marry the two colors together now
that I have everything nice and blended
out I think I'm going to try to use this
OCC lick liquid this OCC glitter this is
in the shade beige and it's copper so I
don't really understand that but it's
really pretty I don't know let's see how
it looks because it does look a little
thick I just lightly dampened this brush
it's a synthetic makeup
so now I'm gonna go ahead and apply my
falsies and you guys guessed it they're
the house of lashes ikonics
I'm just gonna go ahead and pop these on
yeah mm-hmm
House of lashes ikonics always hit the
spot okay so now that I finished the top
of the eyes with all the glitter I'm
going to try to kind of dust off any
glitter that fell I doubt I'm gonna get
all of it because that stuff is sticky
I've already applied my foundation and
I'm just going to go in with my Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer this isn't
the shade medium light I'm just going to
go right over the glitter cuz just cuz
this is the real techniques sculpting
brush I like to use this because it fits
perfectly under the eye I'm just going
to go ahead and blend that out right
after I do my concealer you want to make
sure to set it right away because like I
said Creason is not cute and I'm gonna
use my honest Aussie Beverly Hills
banana powder with my ELF blush brush I
am gonna go ahead and use my Mac Studio
Fix foundation in NC 43 it's pretty dark
and I'm using my favorite contour brush
at the moment which is the Mac 168 I'm
going to swirl it around in there and
this is a powder foundation so it gives
you that extra coverage and it's also
going to warm up my skin because it is a
little bit darker but it's like subtle
so I like it
okay and then I'm gonna go even further
with that bronzy look and use my Too
Faced chocolate um bronzer and this is
in the shade dark chocolate Soleil if
you guys are looking for an affordable
bronzer blush and highlighter I'm
telling you guys this is so nice
it's a Sun light brown wait what is it
sunlight trio from City color and just
apply it to the tops of my cheekbones
look at that highlight I mean yeah let's
get highlight pop it on the Cupid's bow
okay so now I'm going to apply some
blush and this is one of my favorites
lately because I love the oranjee tones
and it kind of goes with the orange
tones in my eyes this is my hot makeup
and it's in the shade treasure looks
like this I'm just gonna pop that on I'm
gonna finish the lower lash line of the
eyes I'm using the Milani brow pencil
again and I'm going to line the
waterline with this and the lash line a
little bit and then after I apply it I'm
going to blend it out with a pencil
brush
I'm also going to apply more about
Galapagos eyeshadow on the lower lash
line just to kind of set the liner so it
doesn't smudge alright I'm just gonna
take a little more of that Persia
eyeshadow and blend out the brown here
taking a small angled brush into this
flamethrower eyes shadow I'm going to
pop it just to the center of the lower
lash line
kind of like the highlighted look it
gives just in the center of the eye for
an inner corner highlight I'm going to
use this OCC pigment in the shade
flicker okay lastly for the eyes I'm
just gonna go ahead and pop on some
mascara and I'm using the benefit roller
lash mascara I'm just gonna apply a
little bit cuz I forgot to put some on
before my eyelashes so I'm just kind of
going at the base with this for the lips
on this you guys probably guess that I'm
going to go with nude because it's kind
of already really like crazy so I'm
going to use the color pop lip pencil in
the shade skimpy
Asli I'm going to use the same matching
lipstick this is also by color pop in
the shade skimpy I'm just going to go
back in with the pencil and blend it in
because it's a little too nude for me at
the moment
alright and this is the finished makeup
look alright guys so that is it for this
tutorial I really hope that you enjoyed
