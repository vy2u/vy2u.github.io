I'm so excited to have done this good
girl bad girl collab with the beautiful
miss maven calm make sure you guys check
out her channel to see her rendition on
a good girl but let's get started with
the bad I'm gonna start by applying my
hello flawless foundation by benefit all
over the skin and I'm gonna buff it in
using this hard brush now I'm going to
go in with my Bobbi Brown foundation
stick and this isn't the color almond
basically going to warm up my skin and
just give us a little definition
so I'm gonna move on to the eyes and
then we'll finish the face off later I'm
just gonna use my Mac soft ochre and
apply that to the lid as in face then
I'm going to go in with the color cream
from the Anasazi a lavish palette and
apply that as a brow bone highlight now
I'm going to go into orange soda and use
that as a really soft transition color
and this is also going to help us map
out our shape picking up a bit of Sienna
I'm going to put that into the crease
and you really start to define the shape
and as you guys can see I'm kind of
keeping it more round to really
intensify that crease and smoke it out
I'm going to use a sketch by Mac and I'm
just going to start applying that as
we've applied the other shadows and
mostly concentrating this on the outer
corners of our eyes
next I'm picking up this beautiful cream
shadow by Chanel it's the most beautiful
silver shade and I'm gonna apply that to
the lids with a synthetic brush so when
working with pigments I like to dampen
my brush and then I dip it into the
product just because it gives it more of
a metallic finish and this is black
great and it's by Mac I'm concentrating
this just from the outer corners of my
eyes I decided to go back in with that
sketch and really darken the crease a
little bit more because I wasn't feeling
bad going up I'm going to pick up this
la girl a black liner and I'm going to
start to align the waterline with this
and I'm going to take this eyeliner down
to Chinatown you guys and it's gonna
look a little bit scary at first but
don't worry
smoked it out with this much liner and
want to set it so I'm using Black
Diamond from that same palette and just
setting that eyeliner before we smoked
out that liner we want to apply our
concealer I'm using Mac Pro Longwear and
I'd make the colors and c25 and after
you've applied that concealer make sure
you guys set it with a loose powder I
know I'm always using whisper of guilt
and it is limited edition so I'm opting
for this Tarte highlighter which is
really really pretty and then apply that
to the high points of my face take a
peach blush and apply that to the apples
of your cheeks and drag it up into your
temples now let's finish off those eyes
so I'm going back in without Sienna and
you're really smoking that out we need
to add drama to this look so I'm
applying these lower lashes and doll me
up and here I'm just seeing what a big
difference eyelashes you think make sure
you guys apply mascara to the top and
bottom lashes as well the eyeballs are
done it's time for lipstick I'm mixing
myth and kind of sexy both by Mac I'm
applying myth first but I don't really
want it to be this nude I want to warm
up the color a little bit so I'm gonna
then take kind of sexy and apply that
over top it kind of makes the perfect
nudie peach shade
taking this Mary Han a teddybear lip
gloss which is one of my favorite
glosses at the moment I'm gonna apply
that on top just to give our lips that
really sexy love you know gentle and
that completes the look you guys thank
