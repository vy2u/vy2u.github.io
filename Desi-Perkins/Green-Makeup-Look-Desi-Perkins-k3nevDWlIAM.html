for today's tutorial we're gonna be
doing this makeup look right here
initially I wanted to do something
really vampy and fall-like and I you
know I just don't know what happened
I was playing with the colors and this
is just what ended up happening I feel
like the eyes still could be kind of
pumpkin II I don't know so if you're
interested in learning how to get this
makeup look then keep watching the first
thing I'm gonna do is apply my
foundation I've been using this
drugstore foundation lately it's the fit
me matte and poreless by Maybelline it's
comparable to the Make Up For Ever HD in
the finish so as it's really matte but
really it kind of ends up being more of
a satin finish but as far as the finish
and the coverage comparable I've already
done my eyebrows I use the honest Aussie
Beverly Hills brow Wiz in caramel and
the clear brow gel of course I'm taking
my concealer this one is by motives
cosmetics and it's in the shade amber so
I'm going to take that concealer on my
makeup geek concealer brush and
highlight my brow bone with it I just
like to put a little bit on the high
points and then blend it downwards just
use your finger to kind of blend it away
next I'm gonna apply an eyeshadow base
to my lids I'm using the Smashbox
24-hour photo finish shadow primer is
the new lorac pro mega palette it's
absolutely amazing I'm gonna take one of
the bone color shades you guys could use
any light shade and run this over my
brow bone just set that concealer I'm
likely gonna run it over my crease as
well so it makes blending a little bit
easier so I'm not blending eyeshadows
that are darker on top of the cream base
so next I'm picking up the shade burlap
which is kind of a latte colored Brown
pop that into the
this is just going to act as our
transition shade so you just want to
have that warmth in there we're gonna
put forest which is a really deep green
into the crease to kind of deepen it up
I'm using the same brush that we used
earlier and I'm really gonna focus this
into the crease
I swear an emerald green eye or purple
eyes the most requested from you guys so
that's what I'm doing and I think I'm
going to also bring it down I'm gonna
blend out the crease just a little bit
with this bright orange here it's called
tangerine and I'm swiping that through
the crease the upper crease actually
right above where we put the green the
brush I'm using is the 228 buy zoeva
okay so I think I'm gonna go into this
makeup forever palette this is the
artist shadow palette and I'm gonna pick
up this shade which is me3 oh - it's
almost like a blue Brown well this one
it's like a blue brown type of emerald
greenish color I'm going to pop this on
the outer portion of the eye
in the inner corner
kind of meeting it in the middle but
we're gonna put a different color in the
center so now for the center of the eye
I'm going to be using the makeup geek
foiled eyeshadow in the shade
yester I'm going to apply that with a
damp brush so I want it to be really
right in the center here
to blend the edges you really just want
to Pat it into the other green so I
think I'm gonna take a little bit of
black eyeshadow and pop it into the
crease just to define the crease a
little bit more it's gonna be a tiny bit
all right and then I'm just gonna take a
makeup remover wipe and clean up the
whoa that's how much black was under my
high that it literally turned to mush
when I touched it with something wet
this makeup remover wipe also really
sucks for an inner corner of highlight
I'm going to be using Mac's pigment in
old gold I'm just gonna take that with a
pencil brush pop that so now we're going
to do concealer I'll be mixing Tarte
creaseless concealer in the shade medium
sand and tan medium scan is just a pinch
lighter than tan so it kind of gives me
like a really nice highlight tan by
itself would be more of a natural
under-eye
and then I take my Beauty Blender and
blend it in so I'm going to go ahead and
set this concealer because it is kind of
high gloss with the laura mercier
translucent powder this is my favorite
powder for the under eyes
we're bacon so I'm kind of putting a lot
right now so it really sets the under
eye I'm also gonna put some on the chin
dude upper lip tip of the nose okay so
while that's cooking while I'm cookin
we're gonna do the lower lash line I'm
just gonna go in with a mix of saddle
here from the lorac palette and
tangerine and mix them together and run
them on the lower lash line then just
blend it out of it I think I have too
much powder on my face it's getting in
my eye so I'm just gonna take it off
okay so actually I was gonna let the
powder sit the whole time but it's just
like getting my contacts so I'm gonna
dust it away with a japanesse 9:15 brush
you want to use a really really fluffy
soft brush to do this so that it just
lightly dust sit away and it doesn't
affect your concealer
going back into the forest green shade
and a little bit of black and I'm going
to take that on an angled brush and
define the outer lash line it took me a
second to say that the outer lash line
you want to be really careful when doing
the lower lash line after you've applied
your concealer if you already wipe the
powder off because you can get some
massive fallout Aleksey lush 215 angled
brush I'm going into the Inglot gel
liner and I'm gonna do a winged liner
but I'm going to keep it on the outer
part of the eye
a quick coat of mascara and some false
lashes I'm using the lights camera
flashes mascara by Tarte cosmetic so for
lashes I'm using my house of lashes
iconic which I have not used in a while
so that's it for the eyes now we're just
gonna finish off the face which is gonna
be pretty quick I'm gonna apply my
highlighter first this is the honest
hacia beverly hills highlighter in so
Hollywood and this is the a 23 brush
that they created to go with them
I'm also gonna apply that to the Cupid's
bow the tip of the nose next I'm going
in with my bronzer this one is by Mac
give me sun which is my favorite you
guys already know this and I'm just
gonna bronze my whole face up with this
using my Mac 1 6 8 brush
so for blush have been absolutely
obsessed with this one by Sigma it's in
the shade hot spot it's pretty much just
like a really vibrant orange shade look
just literally goes perfect with any
warm orange e tones in the crease of the
eyes to finish off the skin I'm going to
use a setting spray just so that
everything sinks into the skin the
powders won't rest powdery on the top it
just kind of melts and becomes one with
you so I'm just gonna go ahead and all
right cool
so I was gonna do a nude lip but I know
I'm pretty much used nude for everything
so I decide to switch it up a little bit
this isn't so much a fall color but I
just think it's gonna go really nicely
and make everything pop this is a Mac
this is a Mac lip liner in the shade
fruit cocktail what happened to it why
are all my pencils like this
okay so that is the last step of the
makeup look it's a little bright but I
feel like it just kind of pops with the
crease color and the blush color and it
ties everything together so let it sit
