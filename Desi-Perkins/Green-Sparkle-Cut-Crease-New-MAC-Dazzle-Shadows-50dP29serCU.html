for today's video we're gonna be doing
this makeup look I actually just picked
up almost all of the new Mac dazzle
shadows that just came out and I was
really excited to use them so I based my
look around the green eye shadow it's
like a seafoam green color you guys will
definitely get my opinions on these
eyeshadows throughout the tutorial and
also there was a few bumps in the road
with this tutorial so I'm just letting
you know in advance but yeah if you guys
are interested in this makeup look then
keep on watching the first thing we're
gonna do with this makeup look is prep
our skin my lips are like super cracked
right now so I'm going to use the Lulu
blossom this is a raspberry flavored it
smells like raspberry lemonade I'm just
gonna put chapstick on now and then when
you do your lips you want to make sure
to wipe it off before you put any
product over it going to use a primer
this is by cover effects this is the
illuminating primer and I like this
because it gives your skin a really
glowy look under all your foundation and
stuff so even if you're using a matte
foundation this is gonna give you a nice
you know see that there's like a healthy
baby booty glow before I put my
foundation on I'm gonna quickly draw on
my eyebrows with the it cosmetics this
is the universal taupe I've been using
this brow pencil lately
really like it
tell you guys right now I don't really
know what makeup look I'm doing today a
lot of new makeup stuff so I'm just kind
of flying by the seat of my pants okay
so I'm trying out a new foundation today
this is by Becca I just ordered this and
it is called bee Becca ultimate coverage
complexion cream I am in the shade
hopefully cuz I ordered it online I'm in
the shade olive we want you to try new
foundations lately because my skin ever
since coming back from Australia has
been pretty dry which my skin is never
really that dry and the pro matte
although looks amazing you have dry skin
it kind of just makes you look too dry
like I needed like my skin look like it
needed a glass of water or something I'm
gonna pry my lids using Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot I'm just gonna use a buffing
concealer brush to apply this I do this
in every video so I'm going to just skip
right past it I'm gonna use this crown
brush it's like a little dual-ended one
and I'm going to be using my new palette
that I just got it's called the visi art
neutral matte palette number one I'm
gonna take some of the the lightest
shadow and just set my base with this
crown brush just so that it's easier to
blend any shadows I'm gonna be picking
up this peach color right over here I
don't know what color it is but it's
peach it's right over here
and I'm using a Mac 217 you guys know I
always put the warm color in my crease
so let's do that
I recently went or I just purchased a
bunch of makeup online I wanted to start
trying new products and new brands that
I've never tried before so today I'm
gonna be using a lot of new stuff just
because I know my videos can get kind of
you know repetitive with like the same
items that I always like I need to
branch out more so that I can show new
products to you guys so I am doing that
for you today all right so I'm just
gonna be popping this smoking it out
into the crease to deepen up the crease
I'm gonna be using this pigment this is
from Jessie's Girl and it is called
brown sugar I'm just picking that up
it's like a Sienna color a nice
terracotta and I'm just gonna run that
through the crease
but the base on my lid I'm going to be
using this nude sticks and this is in
the shade and guilt as kind of like a
cream shadow that's gonna make my
pigments stick to it really nicely I'm
just gonna add that so next I'm excited
to use this new product by MAC Cosmetics
they just came out with a whole new
collection and this is bedazzle shadow
and last chance to apply this I'm going
to be using a synthetic brush this is by
makeup geek
all right I'm really disappointed we're
gonna take this in another direction
we're gonna go back to green so I'm
gonna go in with green now forget the
whole summer natural look we're going
with this is the shade try me on
hopefully we have better luck with this
I'm going back into my busy Art palette
and I'm going to take the darkest brown
shade with a Mac two-to-one gonna start
defining the crease a little bit more
with this brush so I feel like now that
we went green you kind of need a little
bit more definition here probably gonna
go back in with the green after and just
pack more shadow on since I'm blending a
lot of it away here with the dark I'm
also gonna bring that here
like interview type intervie type action
with the brown so I'm taking the brown
from the palette but now I'm also mixing
just a touch of black to deepen it up
even more cuz the brown wasn't as dark
as I wanted so just mixing those two
colors and popping them in the crease I
was gonna do a total natural look and I
just went the opposite direction right
now so I'm first gonna go back into the
green eyeshadow and pack on a little bit
more for more pigment in this area here
I'm not that impressed these eye shadows
I'm gonna be the one to say it they look
really good when you swatch them but to
be honest like they're kind of flaky on
the lid now I'm gonna do a winged liner
first I'm using the Kat Von D tattoo
liner in the shade trooper to kind of
map out the wing and then I'm gonna fill
it in with the Inglot gel liner
all right okay so after the wing I'm
gonna go ahead and go in with my
concealer this is a new concealer also
it's from dermablend it's called smooth
liquid camo medium coverage concealer
it's in the shade nutmeg
sharpen up the wing that's going all the
way to my frickin eyebrow right now
picking my real techniques this is the
sculpting brush and I'm going to blend
that concealer and under the eyes here
and then this is the Real Techniques
concealer brush I'm going to use this to
blend out the area over here under the
wing I like to put concealer here to
really sharpen up the shape of the wing
and then I'm just gonna use my finger
and blend it out so we don't have like a
harsh line going on here using the
honest hacia banana powder to set my
under eye concealer so in the Ipsy glam
bag this month I got the Tarte Amazonian
clay bronzer I don't know if you guys
have tried this but it's really really
nice I actually have this already this
is in the shade Park Avenue princess so
I'm gonna go ahead and take this and
start bronzing up my face with it
it's just gonna add a lot of warmth to
my skin I'm using a Mac 168 brush for
this
and you want to pop this along the
hairline as well then next I'm going to
go ahead and contour with my on Astacio
contour kit and the same exact brush
that we were just using I feel like this
look is so dramatic that you got to have
a contour contour I'm going to go ahead
and contour my nose using my Mac Studio
Fix Foundation and NC 43 my baby hairs
all crazy today
and then to really really make the nose
contour pop I'm taking the banana powder
and I'm going to run it which is such a
lighter shade powder and I'm gonna run
it up the bridge of my nose just to give
the illusion of the straight shape I
cannot tell you how many people say I've
gotten a nose job I really have not I
swear I feel like if I did get a nose
job I would have just told you guys you
know cuz like who cares but I didn't I
look back at pictures myself and even
think dang girl what'd you do before
nose contouring my nose was like looked
totally different my nose also looks
very different from this side compared
to this side it's like two different
noses like from this side it looks more
straight and I think that's why I'm
always sitting this way we're gonna pop
on some highlight this is the Jacqueline
Hill collab highlight with Becca
cosmetics and it's the champagne pop
this highlighter is seriously probably
the best highlighter ever invented in
life like Oh for blush I'm gonna be
using this one by hot makeup and it's in
the shade wonder lust oh yeah this is
like the type of blush that it bronzes
kind of you know it's like a very
sunkissed blush I'm just gonna pop on my
eyelashes I'll be using the House of
lashes iconic smoke out the lower lash
line I'm taking this bronze shadow stick
this is by jelly pong pong interesting
name and I am going to apply this all on
the lower lash line and I'm going back
into the visi art palette and taking
this terracotta color and just smoking
that out
next I'm going to take an angled brush
and go back into that dark brown and a
little bit of the black from the palette
and just really push this into the lash
line go ahead and top that off with some
mascara at the base of the lashes here I
just wiggle it in the base and then I'm
gonna also apply some to the lower
lashes I'm not gonna lie
I feel pretty cakey with that Becca
foundation I know it's full coverage but
I just feel really thick you know I feel
pretty like thick I'm gonna go ahead and
finish off the lips I'm using this Becca
lipliner this is called nude liner in
the shade nougat
we use a nude lipstick obviously because
with this green eye there's really only
one choice which is nude and I'm using
the new melt cosmetics lipstick in the
shade dude I think I'm gonna mix a
little bit of Mac's kind of sexy over
top just to make it a little bit more of
a peachy nude that's the final step to
the makeup look and we're done all right
