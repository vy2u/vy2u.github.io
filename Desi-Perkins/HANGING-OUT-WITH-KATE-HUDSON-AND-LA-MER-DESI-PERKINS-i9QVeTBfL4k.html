hey guys and welcome back to my channel
today I have somebody is super special
Kate Hudson here I'm so excited for you
to be on my channel because I think you
are probably one of the cutest humans on
this side thank you like there's
something about you you know you're just
I'll take it no I love that about you
first off we're here to talk about this
lemaise yes so how did you come about
this slab eration with them and working
with lemare it just happens that this is
a product that I've used pretty much my
whole adult life it was always my
splurge product I've always loved it it
just always worked well with my skin and
so to be able to then work with them
later in life how do in my life yeah
that's great it's like always such a
great thing when you get to work with a
brand that you already love entik we
just love and have used of course along
of course I mean the thing is too is
that you know when you discover a
product unless you're like a product
junkie which I guess I am kind or a
product yeah you can't help it but when
you love products you really like to see
if they work yeah you don't I mean what
you really wanted you want them to have
results but you don't really ever asked
yourself what creates the results so it
was fun working with them kind of
understanding everything that energy
yeah this and how long it takes to
actually make the cream and you realize
like oh so that's why it has a result
that there's a lot of love that goes
into creating a spectacular product and
now I get to know all about it and talk
about it you know everything so what
would you say is your must-haves from
their line well we're actually launching
is the cool gel mm-hmm this is the one
that I that's no that's the cool it's
hard to see because the labels are
facing that way so
and I guess anger like this is the one
that was the newest when we first
started I got the first lab sample of it
and then I'm always a little weary to
put new stuff on my skin cuz you just
never know what's gonna happen ever no
but I started using it and then I was
like really happy with it and then I
kept using it and I was like this
stuff's amazing I like more lighter
weight gel my skin just handles it a lot
better so I'm pretty excited for this
one it feels good on the skin I really
like it it's a perfect day cream I like
it in the middle of the day when you
actually need a little like refresher
because it does go really well with
makeup you could kind of put a little
bit over your makeup and it's not gonna
like move the makeup brand wait we put
it over your makeup sometimes yeah
really yeah but I don't wear like we
don't wear a lot of powders or anything
no no not a lot okay me under my eyes
that's kind of Hyrule to like really
heavy t-zone I go alias so I put powders
there I'm all about creams and jus eNOS
and when I'm not being photographed to
me the best makeup artists do great skin
yeah and great skin you know it doesn't
mean you hide
you know blemishes yeah I can hide
discoloration but there still is a way
to get texture of skin hmm even if you
have some problematic areas and when you
sit in the makeup chair as much as we do
is I mean I've been in the makeup chair
in every possible situation it's fully
broken out or sunburned or whatever has
been my weight you break out yeah yeah
not as much anymore what's really worked
for me with breakouts is realizing that
my skin doesn't like overstimulation and
actually more lasers infrared I've got
these little battery-operated things
bacteria killer you know
oh yeah that's actually I think what's
changed my skin walk good tip good tips
we're gonna do kind of like a little Q&amp;amp;A
portion here lipstick or lip gloss lip
gloss Matt or dewy though I'm kind of a
matte right now really okay I love the
dewy lip gloss but it depends because I
like doing skin what is your favorite
go-to makeup
for my face and for my eye color I do a
very light foundation I always do a
highlighter yes love my like my favorite
it's actually a Burberry highlighter huh
I like berry tones as I use this very
cheek stain and I'll do that on my lips
and then I don't go anywhere without my
Chanel bronzer like the cream liner yeah
I had a feeling ease though and I don't
know why but I just ended up a little
and I kind of mixed them but it's
actually like the quickest makeup on the
planet if when you rake the list of it
you're like wait that's a lot of time
but I got that but is healing that much
now I could do it in five minutes
I guess the go-to look is like a very
golds and berries golden hour yeah I'm
gonna call it golden hour ago an hour I
just named her look if you could go back
to your 16 year old self what would be
the best advice that you can give
yourself oh man no did that guy that you
did okay then when I was younger was
like I'm never gonna make decisions that
I'm going to look back on and wish that
I did it differently I was always aware
enough to not do that when I do look
back at some of the Styles I have to say
there's a couple that I'm like wow that
was that was Tristan Mosley killing it
in that time though I mean honestly I
probably wouldn't have cut my hair I'm
really really long hair and when I was
16 I decided to cut my hair short but I
thought my hair was straight and my hair
was curly I did the same thing I wanted
like a meg Ryan haircut I ended up with
this short hairdo that was really cute
when I walked I was like oh my god this
and then when you showered you're like
what is happening I have curly hair but
I had much curlier hair than I thought
I'd because I always brushed it that
exact same thing happened to me really I
was in first grade I saw this girl and
she had her hair short and I was like
mom please cut my hair I want it to be
just like that and she was like your
hair's not gonna really do that it's
gonna look different I was like I don't
care just do it and it was like short
and then top it off I did like a short
bang to and it was just and then the
bang never went down it just parted like
in the center
and pooped out like right here it's so
cute it wasn't that cute though yeah now
there's like you know the dry bar yeah
so like I love going there you just stop
in it yeah yeah I didn't have that when
I was 16 if I had that I would have
saved my 20 bucks and like went right to
the dry bar at least once a week are you
a morning or night person morning I'm a
flame night person
what's your favorite season summer
lastly what is one hidden talent that
people might not know about you I'm
actually really good with cocktails for
some reason when I bought my house years
ago the last owner loved kumquats which
i think is kind of a strange tree too
how cuz it's so many kumquats I was like
what am I gonna do has come quite so I
decided I was gonna make a jam but then
I said no you know what I'm gonna make
kumquat cocktails I'm gonna make a syrup
mmm I made a syrup and I make a really
good kumquat margarita and a champagne
cocktail
she's a kumquat queen over here all
right well thank you so much for coming
onto my channel and I'm really excited
to try all these new products I cannot
wait nice and so happy that I got to
hang out thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you next time good
