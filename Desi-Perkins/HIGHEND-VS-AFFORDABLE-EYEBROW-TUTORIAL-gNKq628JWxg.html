today's video is going to be something a
little bit different a lot of you lately
have been requesting a brow tutorial but
really my technique is exactly the same
the only thing I've been doing is really
switching up my brow pencils between
high-end brow pencils and more
affordable brow pencils so it kind of
gave me the idea to just do one eyebrow
on camera with all my high-end products
and then the other eyebrow with more
affordable product so that you guys can
see the pros and cons just the
differences between the two and it would
just be a little bit more informative
and just my recommendation so if you
guys are interested in seeing the
difference between the two then keep
watching this brow is going to be done
with all high-end products and my
favorite high-end products are from ABH
I will be using the brow is the dip brow
and the clear brow gel brow is retails
for $21 the dip brow retails for $18 and
the clear brow gel retails for $22 so
this right I browse is going to cost me
sixty one dollars to achieve we're gonna
go ahead and get started and I'm just
going to do the demo of these products
on this brow so I'm going to start
slowly filling in the front parts of
this brow with the brow pencil reason I
like to use a brow pencil and a dip brow
pomade is because I have such sparse
hairs if any in this area and I need a
lot of filling in when I need to fill in
areas with no hair I need a product
that's going to be a little bit more
pigmented than just a pencil not
everybody is going to need all of these
products in my opinion it's mostly if
you have a lot of spots in your brows or
sparse areas that you want to really
make look like real hairs I find that
it's easiest to do that with the pomades
light strokes with the lightest hand in
the same direction of the hair growth
it also comb the hairs down so that you
could really fill in the sparse areas
underneath the hair so that way when you
brush the hairs back up it's a little
bit more full looking just a quick tip
you want to hold your brow pencil like
this for a starting point and then you
angle it this way that should be your
arch and the very last point should be
the end of the brow and that's just
of a guideline to help know where your
brow should arch you know what arch your
brow where you want to arch your brow
that's just a tip but it's not the
absolute rule you guys have all seen me
do this in my previous brow videos so if
you want a super in-depth brow tutorial
this is more of a comparison video feel
free to check the link in the
description box down below and it's in
your face super close-up brow tutorial
and the steps are pretty much exactly
the same when you get to the front area
you want to lightly flick the pencil
upwards very very lightly just enough to
make it look like you have hairs here
but keeping it really soft and not boxy
at all alright so next I'm going to use
the dip brow and this is going to be for
defining the lower part of the brow and
building the hairs around the arch you
want to do that applying an angled brush
this is the APH number 7 angled brush
alright so we're going to take a little
bit of that product and I like to start
at the bottom of the brow right in the
middle and just draw a clean line in
this area so once I draw that first line
you just take it and go along the brow
bone shape draw it down like so so now I
want to really build the arch of the
brow so what you're going to do is do
light light strokes it's better to have
a little product and build then put too
much because especially with this
product you will look crazy like you'll
just have a big chunk of pull mod up in
your eyebrow so that's why I start with
such a little product so I picked up
more product now it's getting serious
so basically I'm just building up this
raw product if you feel like a line over
gets too harsh use the spoolie and just
soften it up it's nice about this
product is that it definitely stays on
and never comes off it's a perk of this
product
it definitely stays put it so now I'm
going to take the clear brow gel and
lightly run that through the brow this
is going to remove some of the product
just to make it look a little bit softer
and it's gonna make sure your brow hair
stay in place this is basically like
strong hold hairspray for your brow
hairs so this is the high-end finished
brow just a comparison to what the my
brows really look like finished brow
naked brow makeup so now we're moving on
to the left brow which will be the
affordable I bro I will be using the
colour-pop brow color and this retails
for $6 color pop brow pencil and this
retails for $5 for the brow gel I'm
going to be using the Milani brow
shaping clear gel and this retails for
for 399 Thank You Steven 399 so the
total for that is Sven $15.00 brows all
right so we're going to go ahead and get
started with this brow and bring it up
to par so what I like about the color
pop of brow pencils is they do have a
retractable brow pencil so no sharpening
which I like and also it's dual sided
with a spoolie at the end as weird as it
may seem as common-sense as it seems to
have a spoolie on the other side some
brow pencils do not which is very
strange a lot of them do though so I
like that it's you know dual ended I
switch up colors for this but today I'm
going to be using honey blonde for the
front the same exact process we're just
going to start lightly drawing in the
shape
this shade is honey blonde and it's a
little bit too warm for my brows but
once we use the palm eight it's going to
blend nicely dope taupe is the color
that I usually use it really works well
for the front of my brows it's not as
warm but you can't find it it must have
been put in a purse somewhere because I
like to make sure that just in case
anything happens to my brows I have a
brow pencil it's just gone with the wind
right now so as you guys can see I just
went ahead and finished the pencil part
of this brow and it is a little bit
warmer but take into consideration that
you could use dope taupe which is a
little bit a sheer as far as all the
colour-pop pencils in comparison to the
abh ones they do run a bit warm I would
like one that was even more cool toned
Brown so that's something to take into
consideration if you are thinking about
purchasing the color pop ones is that
they can be a little bit warm now I'm
going to use the color pop brow color in
black Brown this is actually going to be
the first time that I use this brow
color I've only used the pencils so I'm
trying this out right now on camera kind
of scared so the same technique on this
side
hmm it's very warm bro so far this brow
Hammad is not really impressing me as
much too wet feeling I'm still playing
with the texture to figure it out so
things were going really good with the
pencil and then I tried to use the
pomade and I will let you guys know I
was not a fan if you can see it gets
really splotchy it's a little bit too
creamy for me it seems like if somebody
comes and tries to wipe my eyebrow off
there can take it with them and run you
know what I mean like it's just gonna go
by really quickly I wanted to kind of do
a comparison so I'm glad you guys got to
see the pomade of this I don't want to
take away from how good the pencils are
the pencils are really nice what I use
for the ends when I'm personally doing
my brows with the colour-pop product
since I haven't used the pomade part is
I use brunette bang and brunette on the
outer part of my brow to make the sparse
parts darker because this is a darker
pencil so I'm just going to go in and
try to fill all of these sparse areas
that the pomade did not I'm not going to
recommend that product and I just wanted
to tell you guys that because this is my
first time using it and it was just not
doing it for me this pencils already
stronger than the pomade
it's like darker it's filling in the
sparse areas now I'm going to go ahead
and take the Milani clear brow gel and
run it through the brow just like we did
on the first one
so now we have both brows finished this
one is the Affordable brow and this is
the more high-end brow the high-end brow
so the bougie brow so if we compare the
two side-by-side this one is clearly a
lot warmer especially because it's right
next to this side which is the abh side
and it's a lot cooler if you're not
super into the warm tones maybe you
could pick different shades but I do
find that all the shades in the
colour-pop range are a little bit warm
especially on the brunette side so
there's that take into consideration
however I love the color pop pencils
they are a lot softer than the a BH
pencil and the reason I like harder
texture is because it doesn't move
around as much but with that said I have
worn the color pop one a lot and I do
really like it I don't find that it
moves around a lot I'm just saying in
comparison to the wearability of this
brow pencil it does move around more as
far as the pomades the high-end pomade
definitely wins this round because this
pomade was an absolute no-go for me the
abh pomade just has a lot better
wearability the textures nicer it's
definitely waterproof this one was just
moving around way too much it was too
creamy I hate to say it I wish there was
an affordable pomade that I have found
that I liked I've tried a couple and I
haven't really found any that stay far
as the brow gels go honestly I've used
the Milani brow gel a lot I've used the
Anastacio Beverly Hills brow gel a lot I
really really like both I feel that the
Milani Styles the brows really nicely so
it's gonna comb the hairs into place but
it doesn't hold as strongly as the a BH
brow gel holds that one is like serious
hairspray for your hair some people
don't like the strong like stiff hold so
I still highly recommend the Milani one
because on more casual days when I just
want to use a brow pencil and groom the
brows I really like the Milani one so
it's really personal preference on that
I think they're both great brows setting
gels so that is either/or so that is it
for the video let me know you guys
thought in the comments down below of
this type of twist on my brow tutorial I
tried to kind of just do a little bit of
high-end verse affordable so that you
guys could see maybe the pros and cons
differences and I actually really liked
filming it so if you guys want to see
more of these let me know in the
comments down below that's something
you're interested in and I'll see you
guys in my next video bye no no I don't
do that control-alt-delete get the words
out desi for ya I can't super be I quit
