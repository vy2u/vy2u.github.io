hosting another giveaway soon on my own
for everyone to enter as well so if
you're bummed don't worry I love doing
giveaways around the holiday so thank
youi wait if you guys don't know what
you bases like you need to know
yesterday I've been shopping through
Ebates
since my mother-in-law like told me to
because she's super into like coupons
and saving money and basically what it
is just like an online website where you
go and in that website there's like a
bunch of different stores that you could
shop under it gives you cash back for
shopping at stores you already shop at
normally like Bloomingdale's Macy's Ulta
I'm just naming the stores that I
usually shop at honestly the list goes
on and sometimes you get more cash back
than others so the percentages go up and
down right now from the 21st of November
to the 27th of November for the holidays
there's double cashback so you're saving
a lot of money so if you guys are doing
holiday shopping and you want to save
some money I definitely recommend you
base it's totally legit some people ask
me if it's legit because it's almost too
good to be true but I've been shopping
there forever you're into online
shopping I would check it out and if you
want to enter the giveaway like I said
check the description box down below and
let's go ahead and get started with the
home so the first thing I ordered is
from NYX and I thought this was such a
good gift idea I don't have any gifts in
mind yet as to who I'm gonna give things
to I just kind of got things that I
could give to other people or maybe even
do giveaways with you guys know I love
the NYX creams and at first when I was
thinking about buying them I was
thinking about just doing all my
favorite nudes and making that into a
gift but then I saw this and I was like
no no I gotta get this some of my
favorites I wish I could see the colors
but like I can look at the bottles and
know that they're my favorites you guys
know I love London
in you guys know I love Stockholm you
guys know I love Abu Dhabi and I love
this one I forget the name but it's like
the orange fiery red I love orange fiery
Red's the price of all of these it was
$64 I feel like this is such a good gift
idea for whoever I decide to give this
to next we have the Revlon curling iron
I'm a huge fan of just drugstore curling
irons I've had all these expensive
curling irons and personally I always
just buy drugstore ones like Conair and
Revlon I've never tried this curling
iron I actually bought this for myself
this is not a gift I got this for me
Lily I just got it because it was rose
gold and white and I thought it was
really pretty
and Revlon just hasn't really failed me
as far as here tools yet this is the one
inch barrel this is what I use to do
those like really nice beachy messy type
waves says it has rose gold technology I
didn't know most kind of technology but
says it's a 30 second heat up 30 heat
settings high heat constant heat so much
heat I don't really think there's
anything that special to it this rose
gold technology that I'm not aware of so
this next thing I also purchased just
for me because I wanted to try it out
it's been a while since I've purchased
the new drugstore stuff this is the
covergirl trublend contour palette it's
the first time I saw it and it has a
shimmer cream highlight a cool tone
which I appreciate a cool tone cream
highlight and then I think this is just
like a bronzer highlight I grabbed it
because I liked ooh obviously I didn't I
couldn't swatch it you can't swatch
things that's the only downside of
buying things online but I got it
because I appreciated that the brown was
like a cool tone contour color because
if you try to contour my nose with
orange your nose it's orange so I got it
for that reason but I think it's not
gonna work on my skin tone now that i
swatched it because that's really ashy
for my skin tone they have a different
shades maybe if I would have got the
darker shade it would have worked out
and maybe this might work better on fair
skin let me try the highlight hold
please
the cream highlight is okay it doesn't
seem to like really be giving it to me
it's not all of that hmm
I don't know how I feel about this
contour highlight palette it's not
really working for me I just that's the
first time i swatched it was here on
camera so you saw that first next we
have a real techniques sponge I haven't
decided whether I'm gifting this or I'm
keeping it but I'm probably going to
keep it because I've never tried it
before do you like how I said this is
like a holiday gift thing and I'm just
keeping everything it would make a good
stocking stuffer if you need gift ideas
this is one of their sponges which I
haven't seen before it has a flat shape
at the top and then it has a pointy
shape so I feel like this would be
really good for baking the under eyes
with the flat part has the perfect shape
to bake the under eyes I thought that
this bottom part would be really good
for blending out the contour on your
nose so that's really why I picked this
up I think I'm just gonna keep this so
that I could test it for you guys so I'm
just gonna put this in my keep pile so
next I got this Pacifica nail polish
obviously it's nude surprise surprise I
don't know why you guys let me get rid
nails I knew I was gonna regret it my
nail technician knew I was gonna regret
it she actually told me you will be back
in four days for a Polish change and
then she told me four days because she's
going out of town so basically she said
no you have to have red nails for at
least four days
I liked it like the first two days and
then I was like oh my god it doesn't
match like all my outfits and what I
tried to do like make up pictures and I
had like all this nude stuff going on on
my face I just wanted my nails to be
nude and they were just red so I was
like I need to get a new nude nail
polish and I wanted to get one that was
a little bit more on the brownie side
not so much the pink side oh and just so
you guys know this is vegan and cruelty
free we like that
I think this is gonna be a good one I
haven't tried it yet but I'm gonna take
this to my nail appointment next so
clearly this is for me all right so this
next thing I'm really really excited
about you guys know I was trying to find
a fragrance for a long time and I have
so many perfumes that I like of course I
switched through perfumes like everybody
does but I think this is like the new
new for me it's the YSL black opium
perfume if somebody were to get me this
as a gift I would be really happy
because when you're thinking about
getting people gifts and you don't know
what to get them it's never a bad thing
to get them there
working that they already love because
it's something that you repurchase and
when somebody else gets it for you and
it's like in a pretty set I just feel
like it's exciting look at this how
pretty and cute this is
I just love gift sets they're just so
easy comes with a one fluid ounce
perfume bottle and then it also comes
with one of those little travel-size
bottles that you can put in your purse
you know you're so busy you don't have
time you're just on the go I don't know
if I'm gonna give this to and I can't
really say because if you're watching my
video and you get it then you're just
you know it's gonna ruin the surprise
come next I got something that's like a
refill for me I got the NYX brush
cleaner I really think the next brush
cleaner is very good I don't know
whether if I could say that the Mac one
is better than the next one or the next
one's better than the Mac I like them
both this is like a really good price
it's a drugstore brush cleaner so I've
purchased multiple bottles of this and
it always comes through for me so this
is just something I picked up because I
need brush cleaner always on dick every
time I finish talking about a product
I'm like wait I'm keeping that - what
did I buy for other people around here
so next I have another one of my
favorite items that I purchased so many
times this is the frizzies miraculous
recovery repairing conditioner it's just
like a really good conditioner that I
use as a mask I don't like to use it
every single day but I like to use it as
a mask because it's really rich and I
feel like afterwards when I blow out my
hair if it's feeling extra dry it just
gets smooth and silky and you can get it
at drugstore it's about like a super
expensive conditioner so it's a good one
oh I did get the darker one well I have
to have spent open it for me Thank You
thangka alright let's try this one
hopefully this one's better this is the
bronze one this is the other palette and
then oh you know what this actually is a
good tone it's still a little bit a
shear I'd have to try it on my face but
it's not as bad as the the lighter one
for me I think it might work let me see
the cream highlight like I said the
cream highlights okay it's not like
spectacular but it's not terrible the
bronze highlight I probably wouldn't use
but I assume they put a lighter in a
darker so that multiple skin tones can
work with this palette but I could
probably only use these two I'm gonna
try to use them in a video and see see
what's up we'll see Oh honestly I'm the
worst because I also want to keep this
but I think it may be a gift who knows
nothing here seems to be a gift yet I'm
deciding to keep everything as I talked
about it this is the giorgio armani
dijon share let's just call it air cuz
it says air here this perfume i smelled
in store and i'm a huge fan of Giorgio
Armani
I love the Giorgio Armani cologne for
men which one do you wear any aqua Digia
oh god I love that smell it's like a
classic scent it's like one of those
smells that every time I smell it it
just does something to me okay
yeah it does Stevens like I think I
might keep it for myself honestly cuz
I'm giving away the other perfume so I
want to try a new one I'm gonna keep
this one so the next thing I got we're
bobby pins this is super boring but it's
just something that I picked up
I feel like bobby pins and hair ties
disappear so quickly it's like you buy
them a whole pack of next thing you know
you can't find one anywhere so I'm at
the point where I have none anywhere
like you know when you go into your door
and you look deep for bobby pins
nothing I've cleaned it dry so I just
picked up some Hot Tools one there's 60
in here so well that last two days I
don't know why these things excite me
but this is a banana hand milk hand
cream and this is definitely for me
pretty sure that Karen I love that I eat
bought this when we were in Paris and it
smells so good like every single time
Karen used it while we were in Paris for
the rest of the trip she smelled so good
and I I feel like I used a lot of it and
I think I saw it in her purse by the end
of the trip like shriveled up like all
of it was gone it smells exactly like
the banana runts it's so cute to like I
feel like if you just whip this out of
your purse I don't know I kind of like
things like this super cute so I guess I
did end up picking up two of the nude
lipsticks that I picked out from NYX I'm
pretty sure I took all the rest of them
out but I kept these for some reason I
don't know why and I think I'm just
gonna use them as stocking stuffers I
like these lip crayons by next the nude
ones I've pretty much only gravitated
toward nude ones cuz that's all I do you
guys know that this is in the shade oh
five just a lip crayon I think I'm gonna
put that in a stocking stuffer and this
is the matte lipstick by NYX and it's in
the shade sable also gonna put this in a
stocking stuffer I feel like I can just
make stockings for all my friends and
it'll be like Oh
my favorite nudes like nude nail
polishes lipsticks glosses nude hoodie
if you guys like this hoodie by the way
it's from shopper Bell super cute they
make really cute nude hoodies that's a
good idea huh I'm just gonna give
friends nudes okay and the last thing I
picked up was this makeup bag this is a
large clear makeup bag and I love these
cons because when it's clear you can see
everything that's inside when you travel
you want kind of like a bigger size this
is perfect it's a medium sized makeup
bag it's not too big it's not too small
you can pretty much fit Stephens not
gonna believe me what you can't fit I
can't fit all my makeup in here but
that's cuz I have problems okay that's
cuz I'm I'm like a different breed I
have I have issues even though you guys
know I'm gonna wear the same nude makeup
that I wear all the time I still bring
like every single eye shadow because I
think maybe in the slight chance that
I'm gonna wear a green smokey eye with
glitter do I bring all my glitters and
all that stuff but I never end up
wearing at all let me put some stuff in
here so you guys can see what it looks
like
super cute just filling it up all my
things okay I think that's good enough
make a mess here there you go I could
fit all my face products in here that's
basically what I would put in here just
nice cuz when you travel you can see
everything that's in there it's not like
buried in this deep makeup bag they also
had different sizes and I was thinking
about just getting all the different
sizes when I get to my hotel I'd just
lay them all out and have one bag for
face one bag for lips one bag for eyes
you know etc etc but isn't this cute
like it's just perfect
sheee beachy now I had to put everything
back alright so that is it for my haul I
realized now looking back that I thought
I was gonna be gifting a lot of this
stuff but now maybe keeping some of it
but I hope that at least you guys got
some good ideas I thought my nudes best
of nudes idea was good so there's that
idea good luck on the giveaway if you
guys decide to enter don't forget to
everything is gonna be in the
description box it's probably gonna be a
Google Doc cuz that's just the easiest
and the most fair then I'll also link
Ebates if you guys want to check that
out thank you guys so much good luck on
the giveaway
then I'll see you guys later oh why you
look at everywhere
never well and with who do you see that
