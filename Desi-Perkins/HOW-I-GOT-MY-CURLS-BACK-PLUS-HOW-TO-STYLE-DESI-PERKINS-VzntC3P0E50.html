today's video is gonna be a hair
tutorial showing you how I style my
natural curly hair that's right I
actually have or had naturally curly
hair through the years I have over
processed my hair I've put too much
bleach in it and damaged the life out of
it and my curls haven't been back since
recently I have been working with my
hair stylist and she has refused to put
bleach in my hair which I thank her for
all the time because I had way too much
bleach like even my highlights she does
with color and we have just been
trimming my hair which has been cutting
off all the dead / bleached hair and now
I've noticed with every visit that my
curls have started to come back more and
more and more and they're still not all
the way there but this is such an
improvement from what I had going on
before this is gonna be how I diffuse my
hair what products I use how I get it to
look like this I'm gonna stop talking
let's go ahead and get straight into the
tutorial so now that I'm wearing my hair
naturally curly this is the shampoo and
conditioner that I'm gonna be using it's
the way conditioner shampoo but it's
specifically for curls this is gonna
help nurture the curl more typically I
just use the way smooth and repair
shampoo and conditioner what I know I'm
not wearing my hair curly which also
works really well because it kind of
binds all your curls together like the
smooth and repair one is really nice but
today we're going to be using this one
right off hum so I'm gonna go ahead and
shower and then I shall be back first
things first
when I get out of the shower I use a wet
brush this is specifically made to brush
your hair out when it's wet I'm gonna
just grab this and then go through and
if you have extra curly hair sometimes
you might not want to brush your hair
because you'll brush the curls out but
for me I have two that one or my hair
curly I have to put product in right
after I get out of the shower else it's
like no-go next I'm going to use the way
leave-in conditioner just to get it nice
and soft I focus in a lot where I get
frizzy which tends to be like the talked
or I've had the most bleach my hair I
probably put too much but what is I'm
not sponsored by way I just loved their
hair products Jenn forces me to use this
against my will just kidding
I'm using the way curl jelly take off
your rings because it's gonna get all up
in everything when a high school when I
would wear my hair curly do you guys
remember the big tub of gel it came in
like blue and green it was like that tub
everybody used I always used that in my
hair to get the curls to stay there's a
lot of alcohol and that's just point out
the best but that was the back in
the day so I'm just gonna take a bunch
of this hair jelly into my hand this is
what I do guys get into position I'm
very serious I flipped my head over and
I just start to scrunch the product
through my hair you start to kind of
just go like this right to get the curl
going and when you think you've put
enough product in you're wrong you're
gonna go in again make sure you get
every part of the hair gosh you guys my
hair used to be so curly now I have to
like really get it there but luckily the
curls are coming back I wouldn't have
been able to do this six months ago
my hair would have just gone like
straight little like the crumbs of the
top ramen at the bottom of the bag it
would have been terrible but I've been
slowly doing less processing to my hair
if you guys have noticed I haven't been
putting any more bleach I know
everyone's always like go back blonde if
not that I won't
I love blonde and I love all the
highlights and stuff but I just feel
like it was so hard on my hair for so
long I need time to heal
I want my curls back I'm actually gonna
go in one more time just two pumps this
time now after I have all this product
in I have a towel here I'm gonna lightly
push with my towel and just helping the
curls along helping them get their shape
slope you had the other way and then
boom now it looks like this so in high
school what I used to do this I would
let it air dry it and by the end of
first period my hair would be driving
great I prefer air drying for
because I feel like it's less frizzy
when you don't have time I would use a
diffuser it just connects to your
blow-dryer usually poses your blow-dryer
I'm gonna put it on low heat I'm just
gonna keep doing that until it's fully
dry and I'll be right back
I'm about halfway dry now he's a pearls
girl make sure you guys do it on low
he's better that's what Jen told me she
yelled at me for having out on high heat
okay gonna go in with my hands again
lightly bounce up this brings back so
many memories of high school I used to
wear my hair like this every day dude
you guys this curl jelly is so good this
is the phase where my hair is mostly dry
we still got some little crunchy pieces
and then if you're like me and you're
trying to nurture your curls back so
your curls are just like some of them
come out a little limp what I like to do
is then go in with a tiny tiny tiny
curling iron I'll have to look up help
me this one is exactly but it's pretty
small and I get this and I'm just gonna
go through and if I have any pieces that
are just like looking a little sad then
I will go through and curl those out
this parts looking a little you know it
could be it could be better you tried
but it could be better I'm just gonna
wrap it to I just wrap it around the
barrel I don't put it in the clamp and
then I just let it go and with curls you
go all the way to the very end and then
also switch directions that you're
curling cuz naturally curly hair doesn't
all curl in the same direction these
pieces up front that are a little
crunchy right now that's good for me I
put more product there only because
these are the frizzy Esparta my hair so
I put more of the curl jelly there
knowing that they get frizzy ER with
time this crunch kind of light goes away
and it keeps these not frizzy which I
love cuz I need that you just kind of go
through and randomly don't take too many
sections because you still want this to
look overall like it's all your natural
curl these pieces that are up at the top
those are the ones that
the most bleach work so those are the
ones that I usually have to curl more
the bottom of my hair typically gets
curly on its own but the rest of it if I
don't put product in my hair or do what
I just did it won't dry like this like
it'll dry you've seen on my Instagram
you've seen on my snapchat it'll dry
like crazy I just got back from Ibiza
and it was incredible
I got lash extensions for the trip I'm
kind of holding on to a few still right
now you see that there's like a couple
I'm gonna do them again cuz I have
another trip everyone always asks me how
I feel about lash extension and I love
lash extensions but like I'm more of a
lash extension for vacation type of
person because it's hard for me to have
lash extensions and do makeup tutorials
because I'm constantly applying makeup
taking it off putting makeup on taking
it off it's almost like they don't last
long enough but for vacation I feel like
they are everything this one got a
little too curly so I'm just gonna hold
it like down here so that as it's
getting cooler the curl gets a little
looser cuz you don't want the curl to be
too far off from your curl pattern my
mom my aunt everybody in my family has
extremely curly hair my dad's hair is a
little bit more wavy so I think that's
why I'm I didn't get as curly now I'm
gonna take this comb right here just
like a wide toothed comb I'm just gonna
lift up some of this hair at the root
kind of tease it back so that I get more
volume you know just to get a little bit
more oomph
don't know which way my hair wants to
part that's thinking about having curly
hair it tells you tells you what it
wants to do that's pretty good now I'm
gonna go in with the hair oil just the
tiniest amount just one squirt
just go through and wrap the frizzy
parts around the finger just get a
little bit of oil there you don't want
to put it through everything though cuz
I don't want it to weigh down I cannot
wait until my hair is long so that it
could be curly and law
think I'm just gonna wear it curly all
the time I like it short too but I feel
like when it's long I just really vibe
with it as the day goes on I feel like
my hair looks better when it's more
lived-in so towards midday I feel like
my curls look better and it kind of gets
a little fluffier and when I have curly
hair I like it to be fluffier I really
don't know which way my hair wants to
heart right now it's kind of playing me
I will say that much it's like it really
controls me it like tells me what it
wants to do it doesn't let me pick it's
like no I'm not gonna let you part me
like that you can't force a curl ok
wants to do what it wants to do these
baby hairs fill in my hairline right
here well I've always had this little
tiny hole since I was little but it
looks more dramatic because I actually
have a callek right here does a swirl of
hair that stays short doesn't let me do
a center part so I tweezed it off okay I
said you're not gonna run my life
anymore I'm gonna tell you what's up
okay
and I tweezed it and everybody that does
my hair is like you did what and I'm
like I took control of my life is what I
did okay I said not today not tomorrow
if I want a middle part I should have
the middle part so I got rid of it this
is it you guys this is how I get my
curly hair natural curls with a little
help from the curling iron
I don't know muscle cookie okay cuz you
don't want it to look too crazy I'm so
proud of my hair for making it back to
its curls because I really thought that
I had lost them forever if you're
younger and you have curly hair or sick
eyebrows do not tweeze them and do not
over process your curls okay that's my
advice of the day curls are beautiful
and you're gonna regret it later and
eyebrows
I really have any so don't over pluck
and don't over process along say thank
