today's video we're gonna talk all about
nail I get so many questions from you
guys about though I get them to grow
though I keep them strong all these
questions all the time every time you
guys ask how I grew my nails be strong I
also asked myself how that happened
especially going from weak brittle nail
biting nails my nail beds are always
like really unhealthy cuticles look like
trash I'm just gonna go through and
share with you guys what I did and
hopefully you gained some tips and
tricks from them now I don't have this
like magical answer on how to make nails
grow to be honest with you I'm not
really sure how mine are continuing to
grow I held back from making this video
for a minute because I was like what if
it's pointless
what if it's pointless I think maybe
since you guys keep asking it might not
be so let's go ahead and go right into
it I have my little paper here I wrote
down all your questions that I get do I
get my nails dipped into any powder no I
do not get any type of dip it's just the
manicure bare nails and then she applies
the gel polish right on top what do I
ask for when I go to the nail salon when
I go to the nail salon I ask for a gel
manicure square-shaped she does taper
them a little bit not coffin but just
square and then she'll gradually taper
them upwards kind of gives it a little
bit of a feminine curve what is my go-to
nail color a lot of you guys know I get
the same color every time I'm a creature
of habit I love my nails to be nude nude
is for me I'm kind of one of those
people that it'll drive me nuts
if my nails don't match my outfit that's
just how I am I mean it drives me nuts
I'll try to get red polish and then I'll
have it for a day and I have like
regrets like I look at it and it freaks
me out I usually just get a nude and my
favorite favorite gel polish is OPI put
it in neutral this is the ultimate color
it actually matches my backdrop I would
describe it as a sheer watered-down nude
so you still see through to your natural
nail so it kind of just makes your
natural nails look polished and bright
that's the color that I love my favorite
there you go I put it on youtube I used
to be a massive and nail biter like
really really bad I would bite my nails
all the time I found
the only way not to bite my nails was to
get acrylics starting high school I
started to get fake nails because it was
a lot harder to chew off fake nails even
though I did once or twice or a few
times but it was a lot harder to bite my
nails when they were fake we have our
habits and I wanted to break it so I
used to get acrylics and everything was
fine and then one day I developed an
allergy for acrylic nails did you guys
know that you can develop allergies like
you don't have them and then all of a
sudden one day surprise you're allergic
I would get inflammation around my
cuticles hardcore like disgusting red
inflamed cuticles and it would eat like
crazy I would be in class like rubbing
my fingers against my jeans because they
was so itchy on top of that when I would
take a hot shower my cuticles would burn
it was not pleasant so I knew I had to
figure out another solution eventually I
started to get something called SNS
powder which is something I've told you
guys on Twitter SNS powder is a more
natural powder and it's a dipping powder
that they put on your nails and it's not
acrylic so if you are allergic to
acrylic SNS was always a really nice
powder super-thin didn't irritate me at
all the only problem I found was that I
would be breaking nails all the time
like boom broken nail boom
broken nail open the refrigerator broken
nail I would have more broken nails than
not I would break them so easily
sometimes I would look down and not even
realize how I broke it or when it
happened but it would just be missing so
that brings me into the natural nail
movement sombrely movement but whatever
one day I went into my nail salon and I
said you know I think I'm just gonna
give up on fake nails for a little bit I
want my nails to breathe I don't want to
have fake nails anymore they just keep
breaking and let's just cut them all off
and start from scratch at first they
were a little bit weak what I ended up
doing was cutting all my nails and I
just started to get gel manicures
because you add layers and layers of gel
my natural nails wouldn't break because
they were protected by that gel I kept
going back for my appointment every two
weeks and my nails were just starting to
grow that's when my nail tech was like
let's just see how long your nails will
grow naturally before we keep cutting
them just to see if you can grow out
your nails by yourself and I've been
doing that ever since and I know you
guys want to hear this like magical
story or secret to be honest with you
not really sure how mine are continuing
to grow I will give you guys some tips
and tricks that I know that make nails
grow but I didn't do anything except the
gel manicures on a frequent basis if you
stopped getting the manicure and you let
them chip then it was like a chance for
them to break but I never really did
that I just kind of kept going and
getting these manicures fast-forward to
now these are just the nails I don't
know how they're so strong but I do have
a few theories one being I kept getting
gel manicures I know a lot of people say
they have problems with gel as to it
chipping or like peeling off or lifting
I will say that I think it has a lot to
do with your nail tech I used to go get
gel manicures at other places my gel
would lift and I would start picking it
if you're a picker you understand any
little lifted edge drives you nuts and
you're like picking picking until you're
satisfied when you get it all off I
totally understand that feeling it's a
fixation that I also had when I was
biting my nails once I switched nail
techs I realized that it must have
something to do with the technique and
probably also the gel polish depending
on how you know some nail techs may use
cheaper nail polish I mean the one I use
is always just OPI and it never fails me
and I actually do four layers of gel
they're thin so they don't get too
clumpy or raised you know that like
bulge that you can get if you have too
much polish it never does that and those
four layers are what really keep my
nails extra strong and I have not broken
a nail since the day I decided that I
didn't want fake nails and we just went
natural and it's just amazing to me that
I have not broken one because I can't
tell you how many times I was out an
event when I had fake nails and I'd be
like embarrassed cuz I would break a
nail or two nails and it just looked
kind of crazy I did go through a period
where I took biotin so biotin is
something that helps with your nails
skin and hair for me it made my skin
freak out so I had to stop taking it I
don't think that attributed at all to my
nail growth I believe at that time my
nails were already growing I had a
really weird reaction to it I know some
people do a lot of people don't that
knowing me and my sensitive ass of
course I did as far as other vitamins I
don't take any I'm the worst
vitamin taker ever my trainer can't get
me to take anything he's like
supplements take some green tea take
some this take some
I'm like for sure never take them he
doesn't watch my channel so he'll never
see this I will say I eat somewhat clean
occasionally not a healthy diet will
help with nail growth as well just like
it helps with your skin and all that
stuff going back to the importance of
having a good nail tech I really do
believe that the amount of filing a nail
tech does when they do do your fake
nails has a lot to do with the strength
of your nail when you take them off
here's a picture of my natural nails
this is after she buffed off all the gel
so this is what my natural nails look
like I've had other nail techs do my
nails before and they filed them down so
thin that my nails felt like paper
whereas I feel like now that's not the
case they're not filed down that then
even when I removed the gel she never
files down my real nail she always just
peels off the gel by soaking them and
it's totally fun at the end of the day
for me it came down to frequent gel
manicures and just the nail technician
not filing my natural nails down at all
now I'm just gonna give you guys some
tips that I've researched not from
personal experience but just you know a
little google just in case you're
watching and you might want to know like
how can I try to grow my nails here's
some tips massaging your cuticle beds
with olive oil once a day can help
promote healthy nail growth this one's
kind of weird to me but I did read that
soaking your nails and fresh orange
juice once a day for 10 minutes is
supposed to be really good for nail
growth Google said it I'm not arguing
vitamins b9 really helps biotin like we
mentioned earlier and then also a
vitamin C which is also really good for
your skin I use like a vitamin C serum
for my skin's everything that helps your
nails also helps your skin you kind of
just have to test and see what works for
you yeah those are all my tips I hope I
answered everything that is my nail
growth journey those are all the
questions you guys have always asked me
about my nails if you have any other
ones feel free to put them in the
comments down below just in case I
forgot I will answer them for you no
problem

know if you have trouble growing your
nails if you also have a nail biting
problem I understand thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
in the next
video by oh my god I almost forgot to
tell you guys something I'm already in
my onesie but I had to come back to tell
you guys the story when my nails were
really weak and I was desperate I told
my dad my nails keep breaking they can't
grow he told me eat jell-o jell-o makes
your nails strong I can't even tell you
guys how much jello I ate after he told
me that and guess what jello constipate
cyou okay thanks dad I'm just gonna say
that although my nails did feel pretty
strong after that I will say but I had
issues other places so I'd only people
need to know how long just something I
had to tell you guys you know those
posters were there holding the Rose
