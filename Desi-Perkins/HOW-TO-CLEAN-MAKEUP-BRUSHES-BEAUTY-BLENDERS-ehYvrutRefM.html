how to clean yo dirty brushes why clean
your brushes you may ask well by
cleaning them it will remove old makeup
dirt oil dead skin and bacteria and all
of those things contribute to making you
break out and we don't want that ideally
you should wash your brushes at least
once a week I'm not saying I do all of
that but ideally in my perfect world you
should there are a ton of different
methods for cleaning your brushes so I'm
gonna show you guys a few that I've
picked up along the way from other
YouTube videos and just experience first
method is going to be an antibacterial
hand or dish soap olive oil and of
course a tiny little Bowl to mix it all
in so what you want to do is mix your
dish soap or hand soap and people say
equal parts olive oil but I don't like
make sure to be super oily because I
find it tends to stick in my brushes and
I don't like that so I just use a tiny
amount of olive oil and olive oil is
going to condition our brushes while the
antibacterial soap is going to disinfect
them so you should have something that
looks like this to demonstrate this I'm
going to use a textured mat which I will
explain later a damp dirty brush you're
gonna dip it into the mixture head down
and then you're just going to swirl the
brush onto the textured mat to really
deep clean the bristles rinse after you
rinse you have a perfectly clean brush
with at home products next method would
be a bar of gentle unscented hand soap
the method is ultimately the same you
take your damp brush and you start to
swirl it on it to the bar of soap to add
a little bit of conditioner sometimes I
like to add olive oil to that because
the soap can be a little harsh just by
itself and then you're gonna rinse it
off for the purpose of the video not to
waste water I'm just using this little
Bowl but you can do it under the sink
another method is of course a soap
specifically created to
cleaning your makeup brushes this one is
my favorite and it's by Boulevard
cosmetics I will be using this one in
the demo so we'll get back to that later
and before we get onto the real deep
clean demo I wanted to touch on spot
cleaning your brushes this is something
you can do every day after you use your
brushes to keep them clean throughout
the week you're just gonna take a little
bit of the spot cleaner this one is by
Mac put it on a paper towel and lightly
which I'm not doing here but lightly
swirl your brush into that mixture onto
the paper towel until you see no more
color and you can tell that the brush is
clean specifically recommend doing this
with eyeliner brushes or any brushes
that you put close to your eye to
prevent eye infection lastly you want to
have rubbing alcohol and this is
something you want to have regardless of
your method because this is to clean the
handles of our brushes you're just gonna
take a little bit of the rubbing alcohol
onto a paper towel and lightly graze the
handle of the brush because we do touch
a lot of things and then you touch your
brush and then you touch your face and
then you get a pimple and then you
wonder why now moving on to this this is
the Sigma brush cleaning mat which has
textured ice surfaces so that it can
really deep clean all of your brushes
whether they be less dense more dense
foundation brush little eye brushes
pretty much anything there's a texture
to really deep clean them and it's nice
because it just suctions to the bottom
of your sink which I really like however
if you are balling on a budget you can
use this a state of the art of fancy pot
holder that I purchased at the 99-cent
store it has this texture on it so it
helps clean the brushes and of course it
doesn't have different textures for
different sizes like the Sigma one does
but it's a lot better than using the
palm of your hand because your hand gets
pruney and Amino like t this is actually
a tip I picked up from Spanky valentine
here on YouTube and it's absolutely
genius so here are the things that I'll
be using the Sigma matte the boulevard
cosmetics brush cleaner some rubbing
alcohol and of course dirty brushes oh
and you're gonna need some paper towels
obviously alright so let's get started
welcome to my fancy state of the art
sink so what you want to do first is
turn the water temperature to a lukewarm
Tim nothing too high nothing too cold to
hot will ruin your brushes once you have
that turn it off because you want to
conserve water so make sure you turn off
the water when you're not you
it I'm setting up my Sigma mat and
getting my Boulevard cosmetics brush
cleaner out ready to go I'm using this
brush is my first example just cuz it's
dirty
a-and it's double-sided so you'll be
able to see the difference between the
two as you guys can see the first thing
you want to do is damp the brush and
hold the brush vertically pointing
downwards because you don't want the
water to get into the base of the brush
it's gonna loosen the glue that way and
then your bristles are gonna fall out
and we don't want that then you're just
gonna swirl it ever so gracefully into
your soap of choice once you get it nice
and saturated just go ahead and start
massaging it into a textured mat
whatever mat you decide to use even if
it's the palm of your hand if that's all
you got that's okay just start kind of
swirling it around and then rinse it
make sure you rinse all the products out
of your brush especially if we're using
the olive oil because you don't want the
residue of that in your brush and as you
guys can see how white the brush
actually is supposed to look versus
dirtied my brush twist take a washcloth
and get all the moisture out and just
lay the brush down while you clean it
the other brushes I wanted to show you
another example of a really dirty brush
this is the brush I use for my Mac give
me Sun so it has a lot of bronzer on it
I'm using that doing the same method and
rinsing just to show you how well this
brush cleaner cleans that my brushes
boom it looks fabulous once again I'm
just gonna repeat the process with all
of my brushes I didn't think I needed to
show you every single one because we'd
be here for a very long time and then
just lay them all out across on a clean
paper towel once you lay them out like I
said take a little bit of rubbing
alcohol and lightly clean the base of
all your brushes so that they are 100%
disinfected and they're not going to be
spreading any bacteria a lot of people
forget about the handles but you really
shouldn't it's very important
of course you can't forget about your
beauty blenders I have a light-colored
one which I don't even know what color
this is supposed to be anymore and a
black one I'm gonna show you guys an
example of this one just because it
looks so dirty and I want to impress you
with how clean I can get it so I'm gonna
do the same thing rubbing it on to the
boulevard cosmetic soap and what you
want to do with Beauty blenders I see
with my thumb I'm kind of forcing all
the foundation out towards the tip of
the sponge you want to make sure to keep
pushing all the product out through
either side of the sponge until there is
no more dump left in there then just
rinse out the Beauty Blender revealing
its true colors once we're done washing
all of our brushes another really
important thing is drying your brushes
so you want to dry your brushes hanging
vertically which is really hard without
messing up the bristles if you dry your
brushes laying flat it could definitely
build up bacteria which we don't want so
I learned this tip on youtube by getting
a cutting board and three rubber bands
you're gonna go ahead and place those
rubber bands horizontally along the
cutting board
and then it should look something like
this now take your makeup brush and what
you're gonna do is pull it through the
first rubber band skip the center and
then pull it through the last and with
the second brush you're gonna do the
opposite so you're just gonna keep
placing the brushes between the rubber
bands alternating between how you put
them through the rubber band that way
they have a lot of space and they hold
small and large brushes right next to
each other then you're just gonna turn
it around and lean it up against a wall
and let them dry overnight
voila and of course there are other
alternatives to this companies do a cell
drying racks for brushes but I find that
this is a little bit easier and just
cheaper so that's everything that is how
I clean my brushes I really hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
