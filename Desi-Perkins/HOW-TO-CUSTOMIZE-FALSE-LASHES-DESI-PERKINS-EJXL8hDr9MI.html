shall I say welcome me back to my
channel because it's been a hot minute I
just got back in the squad tour we took
seven plane rides in eight days which is
crazy crazy for me because I hate flying
I decided to film a video showing you
guys how to customize strip lashes a lot
of celebrity makeup artists use this
technique and it's just a really good
way to take any pair of lashes and make
them your own to give them the style
you're looking for for example for me I
love the lashes to be more elongated on
the outer corners make them look more
cat eye give you more of like that sexy
sultry eye it's really easy to do once I
show you guys are going to be like whoa
that's easy so you can just pick up any
drugstore lashes my favorite ones to
customize are the demi wispies by Ardell
just because there you have a really
nice base shape of what I like which is
smaller on the inside and then they
gradually get longer on the outside but
I like to make them a little bit more
full and a little bit longer on the
outer corners so I'm not sure you guys
how to do that it's super easy let's get
started okay so the first thing you're
going to need and the most important is
your chicken claws then you're going to
need your favorite pair of strip lashes
or maybe not your favorite pair actually
because your favorite pair would already
be customized but these are my favorite
drugstore pair to customize if you will
and you're gonna need some individual
cluster lashes you could either use
House of lash wands or you could use the
ones from the drugstore which are Ardell
I like this pack because it comes with
long medium and short if you don't get
this pack you can buy them each
separately so you can buy one pack of
all small one pack of medium one pack of
long but this just comes with all of
them so it's already ready for you
you're going to need your lash glue
mine's really crusty and some tweezers
you got to keep you guys on your toes
I'm going to take the our gel whiskey's
like so and I'm also going to open up
these
to be using the Ardell individual lashes
they also sell these individual lashes
without the knots which are really
really nice to do this with but I find
that the ones with the knots are usually
most available at drugstores I don't see
the other ones as often but they both
work I've used them with both and it's
both fine how many times did I say both
whatever both are good I just drink like
almost this whole coffee here so that's
why I'm a little bit hyper so now we
have our lashes that we want to
customize and our individuals ready I
like to take this paper insert that came
with these lashes and what I do is I use
that as my scrap paper to apply glue I'm
taking my house of lash glue and
applying the little dollop of it onto
the paper because I like the glue to get
a little bit tacky so that it sticks
easier to the individual lashes these
glues come with the value pack but these
are permanent lash glue so I don't use
these these are more for like if you
want to do individual lashes that last
you I don't know like weeks so I don't
 with those so I just gently pulled
this off of the wrapper and then I'm
going to put it back on because it
stucks super tight and you don't really
want to be tugging at it this hard after
you've applied the individual lashes you
want to do all of this with tweezers
just because it makes it a lot easier
I'm going to start with the long lashes
which are these rows here so I'm going
to take one of the long lashes and I'm
going to dip it into the glue saturate
the knot of the lash with the glue and
then you're going to take this and place
it as close to the lash band as you can
get it so once I set the lash where I
want it I just take the tweezers and
kind of pinch them together like this
and push it down onto the band to make
sure it's securely
stuck there so I'm just going to do that
again I'm going to take another long
lash and I'm gonna apply it right next
to or you don't have to apply it right
next to each other you can actually like
skip a beat and apply it just
a little bit over depending on what kind
of lash you want I want a really
elongated outer corner lash so I'm going
to put it right next to it
now we have two long lashes and I'm
going to continue putting long lashes
basically I use about half of this row
on the outer edge and the other half on
the other lash that's just what I do
but you guys can do whatever floats your
boat
sometimes I'll change it up too and I'll
even cut up a pair of strip lashes that
I really like the pattern of and I'll
put the strip lashes on top of these you
know what I'm saying so I'll take
another pair of these let's just say
there another style and I'll cut them up
so they're in chunks like this and then
place them over these as well the tacky
are the glue gets the easier they stick
to the lash you can already see the
difference the fullness is getting real
over here compared to this I like to
kind of like lift this off of the
container make sure everything is good
it is so then we're going to continue so
there's 14 long I've applied seven to
the outer edge of this side so we're
going to move on to medium now I like
the lash to taper in from long to short
that's why we're moving on to this
length now put that medium down right
next to the last long let me get a
little more glue here by the way house
of lash glue is my favorite lash glue
just because it's strong I mean it's
also really hard to remove but I'd
rather my lash stay on then pop off when
I'm trying to have a good time with the
mediums I like to make them a little bit
more sparse so I will start kind of not
placing them right next to each other
because I don't want it to be super
thick in this part of the lash I like it
to be a little bit more spiky the
fullness should all be mostly over here
so I put two mediums there I might see
if I want to add another one but for now
I'm going to go into short skip three
spaces and when I say spaces I mean like
imagine you put three lashes down so you
start to get a feel of the space the
spacing so I'll skip the
medium section and go down to the short
just to see what I want to do with that
I'm going to go back into the medium I
don't know why I skipped around but
that's just what I do it's a creative
process so it's not always like in order
from me I kind of just look at them and
think where do I need a lashe where do I
not so I really want to keep that
natural spiky vibe there
so far we've applied 7 long to the outer
corner 4 mediums altogether and one
short I'm going to go ahead and do this
other eye and then what I like to do is
kind of go back and really see what I
want to tweak what I want to add or if I
want to take something away what's nice
about customizing your eyelashes is that
it kind of gives you a more natural look
because they're not exactly identical
they don't look crazy when you put them
on like super different or anything but
it's just nice to have variation in this
spiky area so that it looks a little bit
more like your natural lashes would they
wouldn't look exactly the same on each
eye when you apply mascara they would
look a little different I swear when I
do this I it's like so much faster
the reason I closed the tweezer like
this and push them down at the curve of
the lash so that they also naturally
curve with the lash you feel me you want
to make sure there's no glue on your
tweezers because then you'll get caught
up and the tweezers will stick to the
lashes and you'll be having the
situation that I'm having right now so
try not to touch the glue with the tip
of the tweezers at any time because if
you get glue on the tip of the tweezers
they will get sticky and then they'll
stick to the lashes and then the lash
will come off of the tweezer when you
try to lay it down that's key major key
and if you do touch the glue just have a
makeup wipe nearby so you can clean the
tweezers off right after alright so the
lungs are all out we are done with the
lungs all right and then I'm taking the
short lash and applying it about a
cluster away from the inner corner
pinching the tweezers together press
down on all of the lashes we added and
just see if there's any gaps inspect the
areas okay I could probably put another
medium right over here so that's I'm
gonna do take a medium and apply right
here in this little gap that I'm seeing
I think it's looking good I think we're
looking good alright so that is it this
is my finished product they just look a
little bit more wispy fuller and the
outer corners are definitely a lot
longer you really can't do too much of a
bad job you can make them look however
you want you could put mediums in the
end footlongs on the end whatever floats
your boat I like to wait about ten
minutes before I remove them and wear
them just to make sure all the
individual lashes are locked down in
place and none of them are gonna fall
off on me first time may be a little bit
tricky but after that it gets super easy
and you can do it really fast it just
puts a nice twist on these lashes and
makes them look so good when you're
wearing that I'll insert a nice clip of
me and the thought field try to wearing
them right over here so that's
everything wanna
so that is it for the tutorial I really
hope you guys enjoyed the video learn
something new if you guys decide to
customize your own lashes and they'll
end up looking bomb or if they end up
looking bad honestly I'd love to see
those too because you know we all make
mistakes show me your pictures on
Twitter and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye oh I'm just not funny right
