today's video is going to be on this
look if you could call this a look
recently I've been traveling and I don't
know for some reason I was just like
inclined to not wear foundation and try
to come up with a way where I still felt
good about myself but put together in a
way by doing the least so um I started
doing that and I actually felt so
comfortable it's no I makeup it's not
any foundation it's just spot concealing
where you need to kind of disguising
blemishes into beauty marks and giving
your skin that all-over beautiful glow
obviously you guys can customize this
look I'm not wearing mascara I don't
wear eye makeup with this look for the
most part but if you want to do that you
could totally had that in and let's go
on and get right into it don't like it
look tired
halter questions don't like to keep
looking at me like this you look a
little crazy so I think all the like
traveling angelic has finally caught up
to me going to China my skin was great
the whole time there and usually I break
out when I'm somewhere but then coming
back I have not slept this is like the
first time I've filmed since I came back
which I'm sorry I apologize I've just
been like not myself and really sleepy
hardly on snap just like staring at the
wall kind of crazy but I think I'm
coming back to normal now let's get this
party started first when I do this
makeup look I use a brow stencil because
my brows if I do them freehand will take
me a lot of time and this look is all
about saving time being quick while
still looking incredibly healthy and all
I do is take the brow stencil and it
kind of tells you where to line it up
right so it gives you a little bit of a
guide and then I just kind of plop it
onto my brow you're taking my this is my
precisely my brow by benefit and it's in
number four and then I lightly outline
the shape this is going to ensure that I
have like the same brows on both sides
just kind of want to give yourself a
nice little guide it's gonna look kind
of like that because I didn't really
fill it in all the way and then I just
move on to the next girl so now we're
just going to go ahead and give hair
like strokes through the
growls you don't want to do anything too
harsh because this look is pretty
natural and if your brows look too harsh
and the rest of your face is very light
makeup it could be all you see on your
face it's just like boom brows so I'm
trying to keep the strokes very
lightweight and very feathery here it's
China with so much fun
we had such a good time there went with
really cool people we have a vlog up on
the Perkins channel if you guys haven't
already seen it you should check it out
that is a quick brow for me usually it
would take me so much longer so I am
like into brawl stencils just because
sometimes figuring out the shape is the
hardest part and then filling them in is
kind of quick and easy okay so now we
filled in our brows I take my fix+ and I
just kind of soaked the spoolie with it
you can just use water as amazing and
then I take a bar of soap and I just run
the spoolie through the bar of soap I
have a silk brow tutorial if you guys
want to check that out I'll link it in
the description box just put a little
soap on there or you could use brow gel
I like to use soap because I feel like
it really holds my brows up in a fluffy
manner so I just run it through and give
them like a feathery look so see how it
almost made it look like I have thicker
hairs out here even though we know that
I have sparse areas the soap really just
made it look like I don't know it like
thickens your brow hairs a little bit if
you feel like you lose any product when
doing that just kind of go back in and
fill in those little gaps that's good
I like this so lately I haven't been
really wearing foundation the whole
Shanghai trip and then since then I
haven't more Foundation except for the
red carpet I've been kind of just trying
to conceal and moisturize my face and
make it look a little bit more natural
and I've been feeling really good about
that so this product has been key for
the look I feel because strobe cream
does give you that like supermodel skin
I don't apply it everywhere I try to
keep it on the high points of your face
this is in the shade gold light this has
absolutely no tint it's a hydrating
cream but I kind of use it as like an
all-over
I wouldn't say highlight but like a
sheen so that when your skin is in the
Sun
it just has this like really pretty but
natural glow to it put it where you
would put highlight that like on the
tops of my cheekbones we put it here the
top of the brow don't want to put it in
the center of your forehead but just
like on the sides here and then I also
take that and put it down the center of
the nose and it's all just sham but not
only pencil hairs we don't want to
highlight that so moving around out here
this is the morphe g40 it's like a good
brush to kind of buff product and I feel
like the edges and concealer and
anything really this is pretty much like
one of the only brushes I used on the
whole trip to do anything
just want to make sure everything looks
seamless and not chunked up even though
you can't see much just like to Pat it
all in now we're going to go into
concealing actually first of her lower
lashes
she's really important for this list
right now my eyes don't seem like open
and they're small I have small eyes so I
have to open them up with lash curlers
I'm going to like pop my lashes you know
the drill you know what last curlers do
but it makes a huge difference for this
see how like now the size like and this
one's kind of like and actually I wasn't
really wearing much mascara I don't
think I wore mascara at all I just
curled the lashes you guys can kind of
adjust to what you want but this is just
like what I was doing sometimes and I
feel like if you have smaller lashes it
tend to go straight so now it's time to
conceal everything my favorite concealer
for that like natural no makeup look is
the Becca aqua luminous concealer this
one has such a beautiful finish I will
tell you it's not full coverage it might
not fully cover the redness of these
breakouts so we may have to like mix
some concealers but I'm going to try not
to first and see what happens so I like
to put this under the eyes a very
minimal amount because it's like a
normal amount of concealer I get like a
redness right on this corner so to pop
it over there oh the shade is medium and
then I'm going to go over any spots or
breakouts that I have these are kind of
all like these little healing spots that
I have healing up over here I don't know
what I'm about to do with this one that
decided to go inside of my nostrils but
we'll figure it out
together we'll get through this I'm just
gonna put it on the redness on the outer
part of the nostril here okay so that's
it for now just spot conceal what you
have going on and then I'm using this
brush to blend it out same morphe brush
I like to blend the edges of the
concealer out into the skin so it's
seamless because like I said when
there's no foundation you want to look
like concealer and then nothing you want
to all seamlessly look like you got no
makeup on blend out those edges both of
them melt really good before I go into
the under eye do the same thing on the
other side and then over the breakouts I
find it's better just to tap not buff
kind of pushing the product into the
skin that way it's like more because
this is already such a lightweight
concealer if you buff it it's going to
kind of take away any coverage that it
does have by patting it it's still going
to give you a little bit more of a
fuller coverage the swamp up pushing
really lightly because this is a really
red one today I'm going to take my ring
finger and lightly press into the under
eye here and for this look I actually
have not been setting my under eyes I
know that sounds crazy for some reason
this concealer is so nice to wear it's
like if you do crease a little bit
throughout the day you just kind of tap
over it and it goes away I just feel
like if I use powder it makes my skin
not blend with that no makeup look that
I have going on on the rest of the face
it just I don't know it looks more cakey
and dry by using your finger to Pat it
in the warmth really melts it into the
skin and make sure that there's not a
lot of excess product just keep patting
it then you can go ahead and buff this
out you guys have noticed this concealer
isn't a lot lighter or a lot darker or
anything like that than my skin so it
works on my face and under my eyes so
then I go over one last time just kind
of bouncing the brush over any edges of
any product that I applied to make sure
it all looks seamless so now we have
like a nice even skin tone like I said
at the point of this is not to look like
you're wearing like
full face of makeup is kind of just like
to look like skin so if things are
peeking through and stuff that's like
totally okay this is the only part that
gets like kind of intense and that's
where we add the glow because the glow
is like the most important thing to this
look this is the only part that's super
unnatural but it looks poppin okay so
I'm going to go ahead and take the Marc
Jacobs do you do drops I like that name
taking the mini Beauty Blender I'm going
to mix it all up and apply that on the
highlights of the face then I don't want
to get the highlight everywhere so I'm
taking my regular Beauty Blender you can
use your finger and just pressing it
into the high points of the face here
put that on the bridge of the nose the
chin try to avoid breakouts if you have
them like I just accidentally
highlighted my breakout it's okay if you
do that you could just go over it with
concealer after no big deal see how it
starts to give you like a really healthy
glow and again keep your buffing brush
nearby just to go over all these edges
and make sure it's seamless with your
skin you can definitely stop the glow
there but I did not I'm going to go
ahead and use the heatwave highlight
this is by Estee Lauder
and I'm going to go over the high points
of the face with this very lightly
concer Q ler motions applying this right
on top and taking it in that C shape
going around like this here and then
with my finger I'm going to also go all
right you guys thought I was done there
but I'm not I'm not done with the glow
yet I was a using the new Becca palette
I was like oh man but the highlights are
really pink which is hard to wear I
tried it on more of like the apples of
my cheeks as like somewhat of a blush
topper and it looks so good
Chrissy Teigen has like really really
high cheekbones I feel like that's where
she applies this and now I can totally
see why she created it this way because
it looks really good on the tops of the
cheeks I used this one right here so
it's like peachy or shade and then I
give a little smile and see this high
point right here where this highlight is
that's where I sweep it over and you're
going to see that it starts to kind of
like add a little color like a little
pink tone but it makes my cheekbones
look like bigger and the last item for
the face is lush and this is the blush
I've been using its called Melba by Mac
this is one of my favorite blushes I've
had this blush for so long and when I
first started YouTube and actually I
first youtuber i watch which was Tanya
burr this was like her jam Melba blush
she's to always use this and then that's
when I was like I need I need that blush
and I still love it so much it so I
apply it a little bit of that right kind
of below and like hugs the highlights
that we just applied and whenever blush
is left over on the brush I sweep it
across the nose because it couldn't it
gives you that you know when you come
home from a day at the beach and you
have slight redness like I guess you'd
call that a sunburn but like you're not
at the really burn stage yet you're kind
of just looking like you've been out I
like that because it gives it more of a
believable sunkissed look so I kind of
scoop all right so this is it this is
what the skin looks like when you're
done and because you used the buffing
brush to blend all the edges of every
product you applied it's going to look
seamless and comfortable and like you're
not going to have that I have foundation
on my face teal which I really like the
finishing touch is disguising any of
your breakouts or clogged pores as
Beauty works I love to do this I don't
care if I have a different beauty mark
and a different spot on my face every
single day that's just me I think it
looks beautiful I love beauty marks
freckles I think they're so pretty for
example this one we're going to we're
going to disguise that real quick so I
take a little bit on the liner brush
lightly press it onto our breakout here
now it's a beauty mark I have like a
like this little blackhead that just
won't go away for I don't know why it
wants to live on my face forever I've
been just making it a biggie mark so
boom let's uh let's visit this guy over
here same thing and I haven't dipped
back into the eyeshadow I've just been
using whatever's on my brush
mm-hmm gone now instead of looking like
I have bumps that I put concealer over
it just looks like I have some freckles
or some beauty marks what-have-you
lastly is lip color I want to use
something that makes my lips look
natural just to keep with the vibe
the NYX soft matte lip cream in London
it kind of looks like my lip color to be
honest it's not too far off but it just
gives them an even overall tone brings a
little life to your face because it does
have a little bit of color and this is
it this is the finished makeup look if
you could even call it like a makeup
look this is just my favorite go to
everyday look these days which is crazy
because a few years ago my everyday look
is totally different but thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you in
my next video bye
I've been loving this makeup look I
think it's perfect for summer spring or
just like if you run into an
ex-boyfriend or something you're like I
don't look so good
you know you don't put that in there
that's Jane okay but you know what I
mean like I don't want to run into like
somebody at Trader Joe's from high
school on there like I want even up to
and you look crazy are you tired</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
