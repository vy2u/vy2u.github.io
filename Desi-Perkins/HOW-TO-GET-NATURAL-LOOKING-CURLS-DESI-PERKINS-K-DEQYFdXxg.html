today's video is going to be a hair
tutorial and this this is a look ok this
hair is a look I love it I love curly
hair I was inspired by the curly hair
that I used to have and I'm starting to
like see curls coming back so I thought
I would embrace that and wear my hair
really really curly one night but of
course I needed this this for now until
my curls come back so I thought I would
show you guys how to create curly hair
texture if you don't have curly hair
it's not super hard it's just a little
bit more time-consuming but I am going
to show you guys how to do it so let's
go ahead and get started
I liked it a lazy blow dries so it's
like half trying here but because our
hair is gonna be curly anyway Canole do
you mind it's ok if some of your natural
hair texture shows through so like see
this curl along my forehead i'ma leave
that there because it's gonna work in my
favor
when I start to do this hairstyle I
actually have naturally curly hair but
with all the bleaching I've done over
the years I've lost my curl on my blonde
journey so now I'm slowly trying to like
put less bleach let my curls come back
and they are coming back so this is a
good side what I use to get
natural-looking curls is this half inch
Hot Tools curling wand if your hair has
a hard time holding a curl I suggest
prepping your hair with a little bit of
hairspray before maybe a light hold
hairspray just so that there's something
for your hair to hold the curl with I
feel like I don't really have a problem
with that so I just go straight in with
no product in my hair so another thing I
used to get my curly hair were hair
extensions because I wanted volume and
length added to my hair's I'm my hair
short right now we have naturally long
hair you're so lucky you get to skip
this step so I'm gonna be clipping in
these clips as I curl my hair I don't
like to clip them all in and then curl
coz my hair just gets like really heavy
and it hurts when I'm sectioning it to
have it all up and you know I'm gonna
section off the bottom section of my
hair I'm just taking like right at the
nape of my neck taking like this small
section
haier I'm gonna clip this so these
extensions are from the hair shop I love
the hair shop extensions they're my
favorite they just have really good
blends for my hair color and I like the
wefts are really thin so sometimes these
wefts can be really thick and I'm
comfortable but these are very nice
so first I'm taking my 3 clip weft and
I'm gonna be clipping this upside down
in the nape of my neck if you have short
hair I do have a tip for clipping in the
nape of the neck extension so that it
hides the short hairs from popping out
of the side so you know when you put in
your long extension here say I clip it
normal like this and then this pops out
right like you're talking you're hanging
out you're having a good time it's like
your short hair is here popping out of
your extension so what you want to do is
clip your weft upside down and only the
one that's at the nape of the neck this
is the only clip I'm going to show you
guys cuz the rest is pretty standard of
clipping in extensions instead of
clipping my extension like this I'm
actually gonna take it turn it upside
down clip it underneath little hairs
that I sectioned off it's hard for me to
see right now because I have no mirror
I'm just kind of winging it
so let me Requip the side okay so
because it is clipped upside down and
it's the first layer of hair on the nape
of your neck it's gonna be the long
layer and so you won't see those little
short hairs poked through so I'm taking
that one there and then I let slip this
other one everything else from here as
far as clipping in my extensions is
pretty standard I have clipped them in
before in videos if you guys want to
check those out I'm just gonna go
through and show you how to get the
curly hair from now on the whole trick
to getting the curly hair is pretty
simple you just have to have patience so
I'm taking a tiny piece of hair grabbing
the curling wand and I'm just gonna
start tightly wrapping around the wand
I'm not putting my hair into the clamp
because if I put my hair into the clamp
it gives me more of like a like a an e
curl and I'm trying to go for like a
curly sue crow you know so I'm curling
this first curl away from my face I'm
just gonna let it go
and your hair's gonna look really really
crazy but you just have to leave it like
that until you're done
so that curl was away from my face now
let's take another piece of hair
alternate sizes of hair that you take
when you have natural curly hair not
every curl is the same size or width so
you want to make sure to switch it up
this one I'm gonna curl towards the face
because again you don't want all your
curls when you brush them out to go in
the same direction that doesn't give you
that naturally curly effect all right
there we go and see how this one I'll
fix it later but make sure you get the
ends because if you don't go all the way
down to the end when you're done with
your hair it may look like you know like
this is the best way I can describe it
get your ends in there as much as you
can we're not gonna worry about it now
later I'll touch that up see now I'm
gonna take even a bigger chunk here
because I want to make sure that I'm
alternating sizes and directions so that
one's a little bigger and then I'm just
gonna do this last section the good
thing about this look is that everything
can be kind of messy and not the same
not uniformed
it's almost like impossible to mess it
up unless you leave all your ends out
it's like super curly and then the end
is just straight and out and that's
gonna like give it away I'm all about
effortless I'm all about like trying
less oh it came out wrong life motto try
less do less oh that was a good one
felt so good about that one like these
two they're gonna need a little help
later I can already feel it but we'll
talk to them later I used to wear my
hair curly all the time in high school
and I used to use that like huge type of
gelled a big blue tub of joe they had it
in green - but that's the gel ice -
scrunch my hair and like dang the days I
wish I could find a picture of my hair
like curly I'm gonna hit these one time
cuz I just already know it's gonna give
me problems later the only thing about
this hairstyle as I will say it is
tedious alright so we're just gonna keep
doing the same process nothing really
changes as you get to the top you don't
do anything different from the bottom so
you
just gotta keep going I noticed in the
comments asked how I got it so big like
my hair this combination of a lot of
fake hair and really tight curls cuz I
didn't tease my hair at all which I like
the first time you do this hairstyle I
swear you'll probably be like this is
taking too long
once you get the hang of it moves faster
we're looking good so they're really
tight right now but we will brush them
out in the end now what the fuck with
the front pieces I do the same exact
thing
curling them down away and towards my
face I know I look kind of crazy right
now that's because when your hair is
naturally wild and curly like the curls
don't just part down the center
perfectly everything is wherever it
decides it wants to be so a ball my top
hair also towards the top you want to
keep the pieces a little bit smaller I
used to do this when I went on tropical
trips like let my hair air dry and then
just take a curling iron like this kind
of just fix all my curls that didn't
really quite fully develop we're almost
there
one utility lay down hot right now it's
very difficult for me like what is your
guys's like oh my god you just can't
handle being fill in the blank write in
the comments I can't handle being for me
it's extreme eat if I'm really really
hot like I feel like I can't do anything
like I get easily frustrated I get
really like impatient I just get the
most grumpy when I'm in a lot of heat I
would I'd be so bad if I didn't curl the
back and I was just like okay we're done
you guys can't see the back so life
motto try less it's like I'm just going
to bed after this like are we on that
level where I could do stuff like that
and you guys are okay with that like
you've learned what you needed to learn
nobody needs to see the bag you know
nobody needs to see the back let me know
you know if that's where we're at
because I would just really appreciate
that probably do more hair tooth's
that was the case alright so this is
what your hair is gonna look like after
you've curled it nothing is brushed out
yet so don't freak out that they look
really you know tight I like to spritz
it with a little hairspray this is just
the hairspray that I have at hand
the Loreal it's a classic hairspray here
look they put my name on it with
rhinestones I feel like I would prefer
for this hairstyle a light to medium
hold just because you want to keep the
bounciness so I'm just gonna spray like
a little bit of this oh yes oh do you
even care about me okay so now this is
what you're gonna do you're gonna brush
the curls out with your fingers very
easy we're just gonna start combing
through and breaking up all the curls my
goodness
oh yes see the more that you break apart
the curls the like bigger your hair gets
okay so now we have these big more
realistic looking curls here you can go
back and fix any pieces for me I see
that this chunk is just more of a wave
than a curl so I could go back down here
and fix that with the curler alright
