be doing a requested hair tutorial this
is the hair that I wore to my Meetup
most recently and a lot of you guys
asked for a tutorial now I'm warning you
90% of this hair that is on my head is
not mine right now so I thought to
myself hmmm it is going to be a helpful
tutorial for you guys because it's a
clip-on ponytail but I will show you
ultimately the technique of how we do
everything you could do it on your own
hair or on someone else's hair that you
purchase if you're interested in the
ponytail then keep watching a hairstyle
I like to do when my hair is a little
bit dirty just because it's easy and it
still looks pretty stylish I like to use
a little bit of my Wayne dry foam
shampoo this stuff is really good for
dirty hair or like second day or third
day hair and I just run this through my
roots it's a foam texture but it doesn't
make your hair wet or sticky or anything
like that it just gives your hair a lot
of volume makes it feel a little bit
cleaner and I really massage that into
the scalp yes so that is the first step
now the second step a lot of you may
skip if you already have naturally long
perfect hair which I know a lot of you
do because I've seen a lot of you on my
meetups and I don't know how all of you
guys have such incredible hair but I'm
always looking at your guys in here when
I meet you it's so funny how I always
notice that my hair is short at the
moment and my bangs are also more of
those side swept bangs and I want the
long framing the face hair I'm going to
give myself a center part I can't ever
actually give myself a real Center part
because I have a little palette here
does not allow me to have a real center
part now I want to elongate my bangs
like I said if you guys already have
those long framing sides of the hair you
might not have to do this I have to
install a little a little help these are
too to put West from the hair shop I
will link exactly the color and
everything in the description box I cut
these to make them more of a sidepiece
length because they used to be really
really long since my hair is so short
here I take them pretty close to my
hairline and
go ahead and clip these pretty close to
the front of my head along that part as
you can see my roots are a lot darker
than the base of these extensions what I
like to do is take the color Wow this is
a hair coloring powder can use it for
covering the extension tracks which is
what I do so I just go in with the
powder and a little brush that it comes
with and darken up the base of the track
and this stuff washes out when you wash
your extension super easy to use I love
this stuff and then I bring my part back
over and now I have this long hair
that's framing of the face like I want
to let me do the same thing on the other
side now I have the side pieces in
framing my face going to show you guys
how I curl the pieces along with side of
my face because I feel like that's a
huge question that you guys always have
for me I'm always trying to blend my
bangs into my extensions to make it look
like my hair's naturally that long take
a little piece of the extension with my
hair and I want them to look like one
long bang start right towards the end of
my natural bang give one twist to go
down give one more twist and I just
release it I don't hold it for very long
because I want a very soft Bend and I'm
going to do the same thing to these
pieces back here so I give it like two
curls and then I release back here one
go down to leave the ends out and then
release and we're going to be putting a
lot of this back up but we want the
texture of like the messy ponytails we
want to make sure to curl all the pieces
at the top layer of your hair so that's
pretty easy and quick what I'm going to
do now is create a very loose low
ponytail like this and I'm going to tie
it back with a hair tie
it's supposed to be loose and messy so
don't worry about making it perfect or
too tight you want that easygoing vibe
and we don't want all this hair on the
side of our face we want to kind of just
have a few pieces coming down framing
the face pick and choose what pieces we
want to put back just look in the mirror
and see like what works and then bobby
pin it down like that
we want to do the same thing on the
other side
finem back this is phase 1 of the
hairstyle we just created texture around
the crown and put it up in a loose
ponytail back here now if your ponytail
is long naturally you get to curl your
natural hair I don't so that's where
this comes in this ponytail is from the
hair shop I will also put the color and
description of this in the description
bar this is a lifesaver for me the fact
that I could just clip this in really
quick no fuss is amazing this one is
100% human hair so you can curl it
straighten it you can do everything to
it it's a lot easier for me personally
to curl it first and then clip it on but
if your hair is already naturally long
and you have a ponytail you can just
apply the techniques of how I curl this
to your natural ponytail I'm about to
use a c-stand but usually I just clip
this into one of my bathroom drawers and
I close the drawer and that's how I curl
it and I'm going to use the same curling
iron that I used earlier which is the
hot tools want to curl it pretty much
doing the same technique that I did
around the hairline and it's almost
impossible to really mess up the
ponytail because you want that really
big messy Pony look as you can see right
now I'm curling away from the screen but
then I'm going to pick up another piece
and curl towards the screen you want to
alternate the wand and the way you're
curling because that's going to give you
a more fluffy natural-looking texture
this technique is also very quick
because I'm not folding the curl in like
I would normally I'm just running the
curl through and letting go quick
movement and the loose curl is what's
going to give you that really nice
effortless Bend
I also alternate between little pieces
like this and then I'll take bigger
pieces of hair like this just so that it
all doesn't look really uniform it looks
a little bit more effortless and natural
so I'm already seeing like the build up
of textured here I'll also even grab a
little piece of hair and wrap it around
the barrel that's going to give you a
really natural finish less of a curl
what's nice about a clip-on ponytail is
that once I've style it like this I can
wear it again the next day if I need to
without having to do much styling
because the curl hold real
well and my natural ponytail is very
very short it stops that like right here
but because this is so thick and it
wraps all the way around your natural
ponytail it doesn't show through so you
don't have to worry about your short
hairs showing through really it's it's
really nice you see that it's so pretty
this is one of my favorite ways to curl
hair and now it's time to apply the
ponytail I have these three little hooks
here it's going to hook right above the
hair type and then we have this strap of
hair which is connected to the velcro
and this is going to be the strap that
ties around the ponytail and disguises
the velcro and everything else I'm going
to just put that on wrap the hair around
the ponytail and then we'll start hiding
the velcro with this part of the hair
here is a ponytail installed looking
good looking fluffy and if you want to
make it even a little more fluffy I like
to take the way texturizing spray and
I'll just start kind of putting that
through the hair like to pull some
pieces out from the top here too if you
feel like you want to add a little bit
more curl you could always go back and
obviously and add some Moe curl can you
will do welcome to my room
this is what it looks like after like a
goddess ponytail very very mermaid like
a very natural wave super long I love
this hairstyle and if you guys don't
have a clip in a pony or anything like 5
you could definitely do it with
extensions it's just a little bit more
work to clip and all your extensions and
then put your hair in a ponytail it's
still doable alright so that is it for
this hair tutorial let me know what you
guys thought of it in the comments down
below also like always if you guys do
