video for you guys showing you how I
take my makeup photos for Instagram I
know that it can be such a struggle like
I've been there I took me a long time to
figure out a way that worked for me and
so I just wanted to show you guys all
these tips and tricks so that you don't
have to struggle like I did because when
I first started Instagram I have the
worst pictures I just didn't get it I
didn't know how people were getting such
amazing photos I didn't know how to get
my makeup to show up how it looked in
person and I was so disappointed all the
time because I would spend hours making
my makeup perfect and then I would go to
take a photo and I'm just like what the
hell I've gone through my fair share of
struggles at one time I was trying to
take a selfie and the ring light fell on
my head selfies can be dangerous and I
just want to prevent that for you guys I
want you guys to take safe safe selfies
instead of just telling you guys how I
take the picture and post it on
Instagram I'm going to just show you
guys exactly what I do from beginning to
end
what apps I put them through and then
you know just everything I'm just going
to show you everything so first off I'm
going to tell you guys what camera I use
now as of a month ago I switched from
taking my makeup photos with an iPhone
5s to using a more professional camera
Sony next six this camera is seriously
like my baby I love it it's so nice I
just love it so much the pictures come
out beautiful the flash and most cameras
washes everything out but this camera
flash makes you look tan and like bronzy
you can take a makeup photo anywhere
with this camera you don't have to be in
good lighting what else is good about
this camera is that it bluetooths
all your photos to your phone after I'm
done taking my pictures I Bluetooth them
directly to my phone and bam I can
upload them to Instagram I don't have to
have a computer I don't have to spend
time uploading emailing whatever it just
bluetooths directly to your phone it has
a skin softener built into it so I mean
you don't want to go crazy with skin
softener I'm telling you that's a
big mistake on makeup photos it's when
it's too soft you don't want to soften
your makeup or anything but um it has a
level so you can go from low to extreme
play-doh status I have it on the lowest
setting and it just kind of gives you a
smooth veil so it doesn't mess with your
makeup or anything it just it's almost
like a nicer flash it is pricey you guys
it's around $1,200 and it was a big
investment for me actually I know my
husband's going to watch this and be
like for you okay thank you baby I know
you bought it for me
thank you so much it was the best gift
ever Steven I know he's gonna say
something so yes Steven bought it for me
it was a present and one of the best
presents ever if you have an iPhone then
you can still get a great makeup photo
with this all you have to do is make
sure to use this camera I know it's
tempting to use this camera because
everything looks better in selfie camera
mode for makeup photos if you really
want good quality you definitely want to
use this side of the camera just a
little trick that seems obvious but it
took me a while to actually think oh
this might make things easier for me is
holding a hand mirror you see what
you're doing basically also it's going
to help you make sure you're in focus so
I like to hold the mirror up and I like
to tap on the screen to make sure that
I'm in focus and then I just take the
photo this is the time when I took them
with my iPhone I use the ring light and
the particular ring light that I use I
think runs for about a hundred bucks
it's not super expensive so I'll put a
link to it down below if you guys want
to know exactly what ring light it is so
now I'm going to show you guys what apps
I use and the upload process of my
photos so after I take them and they're
on my phone I go to my apps folder this
is square ready and it's used to resize
photos
this is lens light it's the one that
adds like the sparkles that you guys
like on Instagram
then I have camera plus and facetune so
I'm going to go ahead and pick a photo
that I like and I'm going to upload it
to face tune which is one of my favorite
photo apps so I like face tune because
it gives you the option to pinpoint
parts of your face that you would like
to smooth out so if you have like a
really crazy pimple that day you could
definitely
fix it or you know if you have a scar
like I do above my lip you can smooth it
out a little it also has these filters
that you could use and you can adjust
the filters but I'm not going to use one
today I just wanted to show you guys so
now that I finished up in Phase tune
sometimes I like to go into camera plus
and I like to turn up the vibrancy just
a bit and you can adjust it here as
little or as much as you want now I'm
putting the photo into square ready and
this is just going to adjust the size of
the photo for Instagram so in the case
that you don't want a perfect square
like this you can adjust it there now
all that's left is the uploading process
and I'm sure you guys all are familiar
with this and yeah I just share my
pictures to Twitter and Facebook and
that's pretty much it alright guys so I
hope this video was helpful for you and
that you enjoyed these type of videos I
want to do one on my film set up as well
and that'll be more of a behind the
scenes I think I think that would be
kind of fun to film so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
thumbs up if you found it helpful and
yeah tag me and your amazing pictures on
Instagram I would love to see them I'm
always looking for inspiration so I love
when you guys tag me and I love seeing
your recreations and that just melts my
heart a little bit yeah tag me and
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
my next video bye guys
I'm sweating
sometimes it's just I mean it is what
this baby hair
the piece is a mother run away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
