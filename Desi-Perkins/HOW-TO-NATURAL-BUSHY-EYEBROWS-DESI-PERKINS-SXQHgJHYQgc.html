this welcome to 2017 I wanted to start
my first video with something that you
guys have been requesting and this is a
very casual tutorial I haven't really
gotten ready for the day yet I just
wanted to do my brows on camera for you
guys this is my bushy brow
look that I've been doing unfortunately
I have a lot of sparseness without hair
on this outer part of my brow and I have
started to try this technique where I
want it to look like I have brow hair
growing instead of doing more of a
filled-in boxy brow I hope you guys
enjoy it let's go ahead and get started
first thing you want to use is so
because it gets all the hairs exactly
where you want them to be this is the
one I'm using now I'll put it in the
description box next you want to take a
spoolie I'm just using the end of an
eyebrow brush make sure that the spoolie
is wet I just ran it under some water
and I kind of just get it all up in
there it's interesting but it works just
going to take the spoolie and as you can
see it brushes all the hairs upward and
they stay like that kind of push these
ones this way to make them look even
more bushy so you could see the
difference now look at these brow hairs
or reckless out-of-control these are all
pushed upwards look nice and full bushy
when they're all pushed up it does make
my eyebrows look thicker because the
hairs go all in one direction it makes
them look a little thinner we don't want
that alright so I'm just sweeping this
product through and my brows are kind of
crazy right now because I feel like last
time I threaded them they were too thin
so I'm trying to grow them out right now
looking a little crazy this is
definitely my bad bro over here but
we'll fix it in the fill-in process this
brow is just struggling it's okay though
it's okay alright so as you can see now
that it's all brushed out I have a lot
of sparseness in my brows what I'm going
to do first is focus on the more sparse
areas and create heavy hairline strokes
trucks we use the Benefit Cobra in
number four and this is just kind of
like a brow pull mod and I just use the
brush it comes with it's really cute
because it's kind of hard the lid just
flip it open boom I feel like the way
you dip this into the product is pretty
I find that when I want to make hair
like strokes I really focus on dipping
the tip of the brush in so this part
right here you just really want to make
sure to get a lot of product there
because that's really what I'm using to
do the hair like strokes lay it all flat
on the tip put a lot of product as well
I'm going to start right here laying
down the point of the brush first and
then creating the hair leg stroke this
one went a little far it's okay you
could always wipe it off so I like to
fill in the really sparse areas first
that way I can get a grasp of how much
product I really need in the rest of my
brows sometimes you don't really need
that much product where you have more
hairs but you add it anyways just
because you feel like you need to add it
everywhere but you don't always need to
so it's good to get an idea of what your
shape would be like if the sparse areas
were you know not so sparse it's
important to note that I'm using a
really really light hand when I'm
applying these strokes I'm not adding a
lot of pressure I want to keep them
really light and if you make one that
might be a little too harsh
you could always soften it up later so
don't worry I do it all the time not a
problem
taking my spoolie and just running it
through the brows so now I'm going to
take a clean ish concealer brush and
just clean up the edges of the strokes
that I just made if I have any mistakes
or you know you want to clean up the
brow shape make it smaller so this is
like the base of our our brow hairs we
kind of gave the illusion that we have
some brow hairs there but now we have to
kind of soften it and blend it all out
Kate he's texting me right now this
bitch she just sent me this Exhibit A of
my baby hairs in her video which I feel
is very rude look at that I mean not
much is different right now I still got
those hairs going on strong but my
highlight though poppin you're so rude
to me going back into the pommade I'm
just going to even lighter than the
first time try to blur out any hairs
that maybe look a little too harsh and
start to work on the shape so once you
have the hair
like texture you can kind of shape the
brows a little bit more so I could see
that there's a little discrepancy right
here I'm just going to go in and try to
blur that out and I'm not adding a lot
of product it's a very little product to
get the shape see they're very light
still we're going to darken them up but
I need to get the shape with just a
little bit of product because I don't
want it to look too harsh like I've
drawn on the brows we're going to kind
of go into the front of the brows
because I do have some sparseness here
as you can see there's a little
sparseness in this area so this is even
lighter of a touch because it's the
front of your brows you don't want to
look too crazy so just light strokes
upwards I kind of messed up they're not
going to lie to you guys
things happen okay if you mess up just
wipe it off let's keep it pushing if
strokes were a whisper that's how light
you want to apply it in that section see
we got the bushiness going on on some
hair growth is happening here you can
continue to add more strokes in any of
the sparse areas I haven't put a lot of
product here yet because that's where I
have the most hair so now I'm going to
go in and just add some hair like
strokes in that area so that the color
is all the same across the brow because
this product is a little bit warmer than
my brows I want to make sure it all
blends together
so let's lightly go through and add some
of that product not a lot so now I'm
just going in and rounding out the arch
now that the majority of my brow has
hair like strokes and it all looks a
little bit more like natural hairs I can
use the brush to round out the arch and
it'll still look pretty natural because
it's a very little part of the brow that
I'm just rounding out here
look at that it looks like we have hairs
when we don't look at this brow look at
this bro this brah this bro hot mass I
was trying to think of a word so this is
the finished brow look I went ahead and
did the other side same exact technique
as a side that I just showed you guys
actually pretty easy the trick is to
make sure to get the hair like strokes
in first before you shape the brow up
and that's it it's going to look like
you have growth in places that maybe you
don't have growth because I don't know
you plucked him in eighth grade or you
just don't have natural brow hair it's
like I thought I plucked all my hairs
but looking back at my baby photos I
don't think I ever really had a lot of
hair in this area so this technique
really works for me that's it for this
video send me photos on Twitter of your
bushy ass brows I would love to see them
and I'll see you guys in my next video
