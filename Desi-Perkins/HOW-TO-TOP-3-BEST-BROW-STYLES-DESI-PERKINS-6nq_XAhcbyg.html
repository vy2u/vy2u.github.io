like this I'm gonna take you very
seriously mm-hmm hey guys welcome back
to my channel at today's video is gonna
be a good one you guys know I'm obsessed
with eyebrows and Kat Von D just
released a whole brow collection here
what so we partner together for this
video to bring you my three go to browse
tiles and I wanted to show each one
using all the new products step by step
the three brows I have are quick out the
door brow but you still want to look
good bushy brow which is a little bit
Messier but still tamed and full and
fluffy and then the bold full glam brow
which is roll will ring fake eyelashes
today we're wearing winged liner every
brow is a different mood it's a
different vibe it's a different
technique and you use different products
alright so let's go ahead and get
started
so this first brow style is the brow
style I do when I need to be out the
door this is my quickest brow routine
and for that I'm gonna be using the
signature brow Kat Von D pencil and it
what's really awesome about this brow
pencil is that it has the most fine
point tip it almost gives your brows a
micro bladed effect it never goes dull
because it goes up that skinny it just
gives you those perfect lines so that's
what I love about this what I like to do
first kind of give myself a shape so I
know that this part of my brow needs to
connect to this over here I use the
pencil as if I was micro bleeding so I'm
just giving myself hair like strokes
first in all the sparse areas and
there's a spoolie on the other side so
you can just brush through blend and
make sure that everything looks nice and
neat I always find it the easiest to
fill in the sparse areas first and then
really go in and define because if you
define right away it's almost like you
could overdo it and you don't need to so
you just want upward hair like strokes
what's nice is that this pencil is
buildable sometimes I'll use a pen
so for the more sparse areas because I
need it to be darker to match my brow
hairs then I'll use a lighter one for
the areas that I have brow hair but for
this one it's buildable so you can kind
of just use the same pencil and just
keep going over those areas and it'll
match the rest of the brow and I usually
do this really fast this is like I'm
running errands I have a natural no
makeup makeup look sometimes when I go
to the gym I don't wear makeup to the
gym but I do put on a light brow because
I just need to okay I need to have a row
even at the gym all right so this is it
this is the finished quick out-the-door
brow I only need this one product so
it's really really nice the color goes
really nicely with my hair now you can
totally see the difference and why I
don't go to the gym without brows okay
look at this look at this it's actually
shocking sometimes when I see myself
like this versus this the huge
difference this makes to my face is
insane mm-hmm mm-hmm
this is always gonna be my reference
brow for this video so you will always
see the before and after with each look
and see how much it changes my face next
we have the bushy brow this is one of my
favorite styles however it takes a
little more time to complete because you
have to be a little bit more precise but
I love the overall look of the bushy
brow it's a little more effortless a
little less defined all together while
still filling your brows
the trick to my bushy brows is using a
little bit of soap I wet a spoolie and I
just go into the soap a little bit just
kind of I know it sounds really strange
but something about a bar of soap just
keeps my brow hair is perfectly in place
bushy it almost adds a little bit of
thickness to your brow hairs which is
really really nice and this is just an
old Hollywood trick that they used to do
back in the day so it's been around for
a while as you can see I'm just brushing
the soap lightly through the brows and
giving a
nice bushy effect Bashir the better it's
almost like a controlled messy look this
brow so this really gives us the base of
where you want the hairs to be and where
you need to fill in the hairs for the
bushy brow I'm gonna be using the
24-hour super brow and this is also
long-wear pomade so it's not gonna come
off until you're ready to take it off
okay it's a very very waterproof so you
wanna go swimming you're good and of the
sixteen shades for this one I'm gonna be
using a dark brown because I do want the
hairs to be a little closer to my
natural hair color and to apply it I'm
gonna be using a brush 70 and this is
specifically made of four at the pomade
this product is very pigmented and it's
really creamy it's not dry at all so a
little goes a long way I just take a
tiny bit on my brush and make sure to
tap the excess on the back of my hand
like this just so I'm not getting too
much product at once and then I'll go
and dip back into whatever I put on the
back of my hand if I need more so this
brow has a totally different look than
the last brow it's gonna have a little
bit of more of a wild look it's not
gonna look really clean it's almost like
perfectly imperfect so you almost want
it to look like they're not too wild but
they're wild enough all right so I'm
gonna start with my pinky anchored on my
cheek and we're gonna start making a
hair like strokes in the same direction
that your natural hair grows and I'm
doing this with the lightest hand
possible first fill in all the sparse
areas that's always the best way to
start and then I'm going to dip back
into the back of my hand here and just
lightly feathering it's all about the
feathering this is a starting point it's
nice we have some spots filled in for
the most part you get the idea of the
shape of the brow now we're gonna go in
and really perfect it I'm gonna add a
little bit more product to my brush it's
a tiny bit like you literally need to
just tap the brush into the pomade
really really softly and again we're
gonna start with the hair light
folks going in a little bit darker this
time and if you feel like for some
reason you made a line too dark it's
totally fine just take your spoolie and
just comb through it we're gonna go in
and darken the rest of the brow now so
it's all gonna blend in
I'm really just going in and blending it
so it all looks seamless and like
natural hairs as I start going towards
the arch you can see I go more diagonal
here and just following those hairs
because they're your guides to show you
what's gonna look the most like hair
really now it's just about dispersing
the product and making sure that
everything is even so if I see I have
some dark patches I just want to go in
and really soften those up blend them
out look at that oh and this isn't gonna
go anywhere so once you have this brow
on like boom okay you're done
don't worry about it coming off it's
gonna stay when I did my brows in Dubai
people asked me they were like like when
I took my brows off cuz I took all my
makeup off really weak you don't have
brows and it was like no they're like
but they look so like they look like you
have brows and I'm like I know that's
the point no I look at my brow and I'm
like damn that's a good bushy brow okay
it's not super perfect that's not the
point if I see an area that's a little
darker like right here it'll drive me
nuts so I just go in with a spoolie and
like I said just kind of run through it
until it softens it up a little bit more
you still want to keep little gaps here
and there so it does look a little more
like hair opposed to having like a super
perfect line at the bottom at the top of
the brow that's just what differentiates
this brow from the rest you know there's
not a perfect line at the top there's
not a perfect line at the bottom but it
still ups paulus okay alright so this is
our second brow this is our bushy brow
it's all done I love this brow this is
one of my favorite styles so we have a
nice full bushy brow over here and then
let me show you the before which is just
like a sparse bushy brow maybe lastly is
the full glam brows this is the brow
that I would do when I'm going out and I
have full makeup a really really
substantial I look and I want my brow to
be able to be balanced out with the rest
of my face makeup so this is not a brow
I do with a no makeup makeup look this
is a little more like
we here we're bold so first I'm gonna
start off using the Browse truck
dimension powder there are seven shades
of this powder I use medium brown powder
has like a 3d reflective pigment so it
almost has like a the very very very
slightest shimmer it's meant to give
your brows more dimension so when it
captures the light it doesn't just look
like one color this is the brush we're
gonna be using it's made for the powder
it's brushed 75 it almost looks like a
little foot huh like a little foot but I
want to have that full brow look I work
in layers so the first layer I like to
do is powder I'm just gonna go in and
start filling in the brows and really
making sure to focus not just on the
brow hairs but on the skin because this
is the base and I want my brows to just
be on and pop in all night I don't want
to have any sparse areas they say it's
more of a buildable to medium but I'm
like Nam this is potent
which I like because it's quick you
don't have to keep building it it
already has the bristles so you could
just feather up and it like makes the
brow hair strokes for you sometimes I
like to do the brow strokes on the curve
here but it'll go over the line I want
it to so then I just kind of wipe off
the excess so that way I still have the
lines that I want I love doing a full
bold brow whatever is left over I kind
of do the line I want a line here okay
I'm going bold so now the front is
definitely done I'm going to focus more
on the tail
all right so this is just the base layer
of the powder right so you are going to
be foolproof after this you can just use
powder if you want but like I said this
is kind of like my over the top full
glam brow so so after I do the powder I
go back in with the pencil that we used
for the first row this is where I'm
gonna go in and define add more hair
like strokes on the outer corners and
just really bring it to where I'm trying
to go so with this brow I like more of a
clean straight line on the lower part so
I'm working towards that here and this
is the kind of bra I like to clean up
with concealer so I need those nice
clean lines I still want to keep this
front part fairly natural always never
never too boxy even with the bold brow
always keep the front a little lighter
Kelly Bakker brows adjusted my brows
yesterday and she is seriously changed
my brow shape I love it so much
I've been getting my brows done with her
for a hot minute now if you guys don't
want to reference my first brow tutorial
I had nothing all right see that we're
starting to get cleaned up we're looking
bold we're looking glam so with all the
brow styles that I've just done they all
come out looking different because they
slightly have a different technique but
the one rule that stays the same is I
always want to go in the direction of
the hair so lastly just brush through it
make sure everything's nice and blended
and you can see this brow is a lot more
clean-cut a little more bold the lines
around the bottom are more straight and
the top are more straight so this is the
kind of brow where I always put a little
concealer at the bottom of the brow to
highlight it and make it pop I'm just
gonna take that on a flat concealer
brush this is a Sigma concealer brush
f7d then we're gonna go ahead and clean
up the bottom of that brow and this is
just gonna highlight our brow bone it's
gonna make our eye look more lifted it's
gonna make our brow stand out more it's
gonna make our eye shadow stand out more
it's gonna make everything look more
clean and then you just want to blend it
down into what would be your eyeshadow
base right so I don't have eyes shadow
on my lid right now so I could just kind
of take it down I'm kind of just blend
it all out with your finger
mmm-hmm so this is the full glam bold
brow okay very clean very bold no sparse
areas we got the powder that really gave
us that base that's gonna make sure that
everything just never fades and the
pencil on top of it which gave us those
hair like strokes that just fluffed it
up give it a little more girth and the
concealer which cleaned it up made it
more bold made it stand out even more
and give us that brow lift with the
concealer this is the after brow and
then we got the before brow does it ever
get old
I mean imagine here we have a cut crease
we got a wing mmm you know that's the
vibe of this brow than this one I still
love you okay
still love you but I love you more all
right so that's it I hope you guys
