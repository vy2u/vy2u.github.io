barking hey guys welcome back to my
channel today I really had no idea what
I was gonna film and I definitely didn't
want to use neutral colors because I
know I use a lot of neutrals it's kind
of like that's my comfort zone I think
that I still stayed in the neutral
family kind of without really being
neutral and I used a lot of peachy
shades pink shades and I just kind of I
don't know came up with this look also a
lot of you guys have been asking how I
do this top knot on Instagram and I
almost feel ridiculous doing a whole
video on it because it's so simple maybe
I should just do it alright I grab all
my hair usually expanding flip my head
over and put it up where I want it kind
of get all these baby hairs because
they're out of control and then I just
kind of do one twist and then I wrap it
around without twisting the rest of it
and that's it
then I put it in the hair tie I have
these hairs that will fall out so I
bobby pin them and then I'll just play
with this kind of bobby pin it all these
hairs that come out because I have
layers
I need bobby pins makeup tutorial hair
tutorial in one swing alright guys the
first things first you want to apply a
base to your eyelids all the way up to
the brow bone just to make our eyes
shadows appear more vibrant and this is
Mac soft ochre now I'm going in with
beaches and cream and this is by makeup
geek and I'm going to pack this on to
the lid all the way up to the brow bone
with a sigma shader brush
next I'm going into the Anastasio lavish
palette and I'm going to take orange
soda one of my favorite transition
colors and I'm just going to loosely put
this into the crease just to give us
kind of a roadmap of where we're going
to be applying eyeshadows and it's also
going to help our other eyeshadows blend
really nice and give us a good gradient
next I'm picking up red brick and this
is a shadow by Mac and I'm going to use
the same 217 brush for this I'm going to
apply this directly into the crease and
I'm going to focus most of the color in
the center of the crease because I'm
going to be applying this eyeshadow by
Saucebox
called Lulu it's a really pretty hot
pink shade and I'm use the same brush
for this I'm going to apply it to the
outer corners and the inner corners of
the crease kind of creating a spotlight
for that orange shadow
now take a really loose fluffy brush
this is a Mac two to four and just make
sure that you have all those edges
blended out really nicely now I'm going
to take Peach Smoothie this is another
eyeshadow by makeup geek if you guys
haven't tried their eyeshadows they're
so nice very comparable to Mac shadows
so I love using their products just
because they're more affordable I'm
packing this just onto the lid this is
one of my favorite highlight colors it's
nylon by Mac and I'm just going to apply
this into the tear duct area and then
whatever is leftover on my brush after
I'm done with this step I'm just going
to run that on the high points of my
brow bone and that's just going to catch
the light really nicely right there so
now it's time for the eyeliner I
definitely didn't want to use black so I
thought goals would complement the peach
shade so much nicer this is a NYX
glitter liner in the color crystal gold
and I'm just going to apply this just
like I would a normal liquid liner
before I finish off the lower lash line
I'm going to apply my concealer and this
is NARS creamy concealer in the color
custard and the reason I do this is just
so that I don't make a blunt edge by
applying the concealer after I've
already blended the shadows on the lash
line and this brush I'm using is from
Walmart I'm not sure what it's called
but a lot of you guys ask me this is
cosmopolitan by makeup geek and I'm
going to run this along the lower lash
line then I'm going to blend it out and
a tie in the crease I'm applying more of
that sauce box I shadow just to the
outer part of my lower lash line so now
that we're done with the shadows it's
time to apply false lashes these are my
absolute favorite
they are House of lashes in the style
iconic and just look how fluttery they
look I love them I always get so many
compliments on these lashes I usually
don't like to apply too much mascara to
them but I'm applying a little bit to
the base just to kind of stick my
natural last lashes to my false lashes
so now it's time to finish off the skin
I'm using my Sigma f80 flat top kabuki
brush and I'm buffing in my benefit
hello flawless foundation I love this
foundation because it's really dewy
makes you glow and I'm gonna take bare
minerals concealer and this isn't the
color well-rested I'm going to use this
to actually brighten my under eyes and
you can see the difference right there
and you guys always ask me about this
brush it's from a Walmart it has no name
I'm sorry now
I'm clearly excited about this bronzer I
don't know why I stopped using it or
never started I don't know I've had it
for a while but it's Mac's give me Sun
and I'm applying this with the same
brush i've been using for my bronzer
which is the Sigma f40 brush now to
deepen my contour I'm going into the
contour palette by Anastasia Beverly
Hills and I'm just going to apply that
right there in the hollows of your
cheekbones and this brush is by Bellamy
now I'm taking Mac's whisper of guilt
and I'm putting that on the top of my
cheekbones and also my Cupid's bow and
I'm sorry that this product is limited
edition I have recently been on a
mission to find a new highlighter and I
think maybe I have so I am going to film
a video with it very excited sticking
with the peach theme I'm going to use
Mac peaches blush and apply that right
behind the apples of the cheek
this lipstick is definitely on my top
lipsticks for summer and it's called a
summer I melt cosmetics I'm applying
that directly from the tube and I love
this because it's matte and I'm loving
dewy skin with matte lips the summer so
that completes and I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
