have a guest here today Spenny this is
my husband's fun
nice to meet you guys we've been reading
your comments we have seen that you guys
want to know about our filming set up we
get questions from what lighting do you
use how do you film your videos what do
you use as your backdrops as two people
who learned from trial and error from a
lot of experience first my first video
where I look hella green but Steven
didn't want to admit it I was like why
do I look green and he's like you don't
look green so we've come a long way and
we have picked up a lot of tips and
tricks things that are easy fixes for
anyone at home who already has a
lighting setup that could be an
inexpensive fix to what you already have
to make it look great definitely the
lighting setup we have is something that
we've invested heavily on and gone
through so many different Lighting's
like say this is like a three and a half
year process of all the gear that we've
accumulated oh yeah thing that we bought
along the way has just we've built on it
but yeah when we started filming videos
almost four years ago we were in a tiny
little room we had some lights from
Amazigh hasn't changed we're still an
attorney we just kind of built off of
that yeah and it was fine so don't think
that by watching this that you need some
fancy-ass setup cuz you really don't
welcome to my studio chicken stock Sun
step one about filming videos sweatpants
always from the waist down
chicken socks of course let's go ahead
and go into the studio oh here she is
ladies and gents this is where all the
magic happens so basically we're gonna
walk you guys through all of the things
that we use to film tips tricks cool
things that will make a big difference
you know little things you can pick up
at Home Depot alright so here is the
whole space we work with a small space
this room is fairly small but it were
this is where I love my makeup desk
impressions vanity just in case you guys
are interested and then over here we
have my happy place excuse me Steven
will you move this is where I store
everything there's
so a video link will be down below on
all of this and then over here we have
the closet I guess we'll start off with
backdrops this is the first thing I go
to when I want to set up my my video I
think what color backdrop do I want what
kind of vibe am i trying to give off
what's the makeup look that I'm gonna be
doing do I want something really
glamorous or I want something really
clean backdrops can be very expensive we
had a little trick for those and what we
do is we go to the fabric shop and we go
through all the aisles we look for
anything from Matt stretchy fabrics
silks shimmer glitter textured almost
anything what are your fabrics you know
extra shiny fabric stuff because there's
a lot of things in here so these are all
the backdrops right here and what do I
use for backdrops you ask we go to the
fabric store we buy two yards of fabric
that's the perfect amount that I have
found for a backdrop two yards perfect
you can pick any fabric that you want
and I feel like this is just a cheaper
alternative to buying paper backdrops
not only is it cheaper in my opinion but
it's also a lot easier to store unless
you want to store large rolls of paper
like that which we have they also make
them a little bit smaller but still it's
just like how many of those can you
really fit into a room not ideal for me
and then what we also do is we can store
all of these we get these little pant
hangers there so yeah these are all the
backdrops we just buy a bunch of
different fabrics and different fabrics
will give off different effects so this
one right here used for a bridal video
and it has this texture that's gonna
look really nice as a backdrop I usually
love sparkly backdrops because you can
light those up to look really cool so
lots of different fabric choices you can
go to Joanne's Michaels downtown LA your
local fabric store and then we store
them all here very convenient to have a
nice little closet there for that now
that we picked out our backdrop let's
talk about how we hang the backdrop well
we just stretch the fabric that we get
across some c-stands and I put these
little clamps on here these things are
from Home Depot if it's a stretchy
fabric and there's
in it we can just stretch it a little
bit pull it tight and then clamp it on
there
alright and also when I first started
you guys I used a clothing rack to do
this you worked just fine
really the key thing is these clamps
which you get at Home Depot ok these are
key and you know what makes the backdrop
look clean is really just making sure
that you're pulling the backdrop taut so
that it's really really nice you don't
see any wrinkles it doesn't look like
just a piece of fabric like kind of
draped over something also keys see me
your backdrops very important it makes a
big difference it looks clean it looks
nice have a steamer nearby so you can
just even if you don't have a cloth
backdrop you can set an environmental
backdrop your makeup collection set up a
table and just put like ours doesn't
have to be a backdrop animals if you
want to put candles that's your
prerogative you know you want to have a
camera back there throw candle back
there about the body works make it rain
in there this next thing we're gonna
talk about is gonna be a nice-to-have
not a must-have but something we like to
do you have a light that's setting up
right here it's a spotlight and it's
gonna cast the light onto the backdrops
nice like if you can see it gives us
like a light vignette so it's really
bright around our faces and then towards
the edges it gets a little dark so it
just kind of gives it a little bit more
depth and everything doesn't look just
flat this was our old one right here
this one was okay it did the job but it
is very hot it gave off a lot of heat
whereas this one is LED so it doesn't
give off any heat am i right thank you
why are you proud all right also this is
Stephens little set up his little racks
just has all my lenses my camera's my
extra clips everything's just right here
in the studio so if we need to change
they move the lighting around it's all
here
easily accessible honey you're talking
really well for somebody who just had
their wisdom teeth pulled out thank you
thank you you just had his wisdom teeth
pulled out ladies and gentlemen still
still going strong here so the next
thing we're going to talk about is the
actual lighting what we use to light and
how we get the look that we get now
these were a massive investment for us
when I first started I just used a ring
light and it was great so if you have a
ring light totally do that whatever you
have this is just something that we used
when I worked at the ipsy studio and I
got used to them so I basically spent
all my money on these lights very
painful but when it's an investment you
know you just kind of you do what you
got to do right honey
lighting is probably one of the most
important things when it comes to video
you want your subject very well you know
when you say that it's kind of ironic
because you're standing behind the life
so it's like hella dark on you these are
the the diva light Kino flows they have
two of these stacked up on top of each
other
these are daylight bulbs that we have in
here daylight bulbs guys and then we
have this diffuser sheath and basically
what this is gonna do is it's gonna
soften the light so it's gonna make all
the shadows kind of just blur them away
yes and then what we also have in front
of this is we have this four by four
right here and it's gonna diffuse that
light even more so it makes these two
lights look like one light and all of
the light is just extremely soft even
even so somebody watching if you were to
just have this one sheet would you also
need those two sheets depending on the
softness of the light you want so we
could use just one of them and not both
I just prefer two because I like that
look yeah like I said light source is a
light source we still sometimes film in
front of just natural light it works and
you look bombed so find a good window in
your place set up in front of it now
we're gonna talk to you guys about
bounce boards bounce is really important
you want to be in a cocoon of light no
shadows nothing you just want to look
lit AF lit light me up oh he puts me in
a cocoon guys and this is probably what
the best tip that we are gonna give you
guys at
if you're making YouTube videos and you
need a really really cheap easy way to
make everything look better this is it
right it's just bouncing the light this
is probably my favorite part so we just
use one light source that's directly in
front of desi sometimes people will set
up multiple lights on the sides to fill
in all the shadows what we do is we take
some bounce for it and I thought what is
it really what is it really this is
really foam insulation from Home Depot
foam insulation from Home Depot ladies
and gentlemen going in now Desi's locked
in light the white is gonna bounce the
light off and then fill in everything
else so as you can see I did end up in a
cubicle here somehow with this job
Steven put me in a cubicle these are
gonna be your guys's best friends best
tip that we could give you it's gonna
fill the shadows in on the sides of your
nose basically just give you even light
all around so you're not gonna is gonna
be super lit on one side and not the
other side it's just bounce bounce
bounce pass lighting tip is this again
is another little foam board that we got
from Home Depot it's really inexpensive
and on the other side it has foil so
this sits right on our makeup table
propped up the light from up here is
gonna bounce off of this come up and
fill underneath the chin underneath the
eyes underneath the nose so that way you
don't get those dark overcast shadows
from whatever light is coming from
overhead moving on to our microphone not
much to say about this little guy right
except it's a microphone you could use
your on-camera mic if you're just
starting off we use this because it's
just a cleaner crisper audio that thing
runs down into my little zoom mic
recorder right here and that cable runs
into my camera so that way the clean
audio from the microphone is gonna
record directly on
camera so always make sure it's fully
plugged in right honey
otherwise you will be recording a video
or it will be a voiceover yes it's
happened before and it happens a lot to
a lot of people actually that this
little thing alright let's talk about
our camera the camera we use is the
Canon 5d Mark 4 yeah I know I know
what's up moving onto my camera setup
always have a camera on a tripod or prop
it up on something that way it's secure
yeah prop it on some books or something
my setup right here is a little bit
extra but it's just because we use this
for everything whether it's we're
filming our look books like the
street-style stuff or we're filming in
the studio so I have a little side
monitor right here then I'm able to
watch what's going on this one's a
little bit clearer I can zoom in I can
also check focus a little bit better
than what the onboard camera has really
when it comes to cameras again you can
shoot with anything as long as your
lighting is good you could shoot it with
an iPhone you can shoot it with a Sony
whatever you have that we use is the 70
to 200 millimeter lens it's nice to have
not must have you could totally just use
the lens that comes with the camera the
24 to 105 has the kit lens that comes
with it it's a great lens just with that
one you want to make sure just you're
zoomed in a little bit cuz if you're too
wide everything's gonna get a little
bulbous and it's not good for and we'll
give you guys a tip and say personally I
feel a Canon 70d is probably something
better if you're filming yourself does
have autofocus so you have to worry
about keeping yourself in focus so not
all the canons have auto focus the 5d 4
does and then also the 7d d does which
is also a more affordable camera we
filmed on this a lot this is a good one
and another cool thing about this one is
it's one of the only canons that's an
SLR that has the flip out screen so if
you're filming and you don't want to buy
a big monitor or a TV or something else
to you know view yourself while you're
recording you know always flip the
screen out on the 70d prop it up on some
books and then I'm just filming myself
this is so easy lastly for the setup we
have this screen right here
this screen is really good for anyone
who films themselves especially
if you want to know what's going on make
sure that your lighting is set up right
I like to have this because I like to
see how things look on camera sometimes
when I'm doing my makeup it could look a
lot different on me than it does on
camera it's nice to see what's going on
but worst case scenario you can take any
TV any old TV with an HDMI input if you
have a TV lying around at home just get
the HDMI cord and hook it up to your
camera all right guys so that's it this
is our studio setup let me know what you
guys think of this type of video if you
guys like this kind of stuff I know
Stephen gets a lot of questions all the
time about like editing and how do we
take pictures
Oh series I don't know maybe if you guys
are into that we're willing to spill our
secrets so if you guys are into these
kind of videos give this video a thumbs
up and put any other requests in the
comments down below if you guys have any
other questions that we maybe didn't
answer because you know we just forget
some stuff in the comments everything
that we talked about I'm gonna link down
below and I will also have links to
alternatives we're done thank you so
much for watching see you later bye bye
alright that's a lot of light don't
check yourself out okay I might have to
turn that off where do you look I've
never done this before cuz there's a
monitor here do I look in the limits
right there alright this is the wrong
camera that's the wrong camera are you
trying to go in for a kiss or something
I felt like you were like hello try to
like come at me first like a little are
you gonna stare at yourself so okay like
wiped off half my foundation honestly
