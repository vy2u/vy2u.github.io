today I decided to film this highly
requested half pony hairstyle it's kind
of like a JLo hairstyle she always rocks
this Khloe Kardashian also wears it but
she wears a more sleek version of it and
a lot of you guys have been asking me to
do it for you especially with extensions
because I know it can be a little tricky
so I decided to go ahead and film that
for you today I hope you guys enjoy the
tutorial and let's get started you can
definitely choose to do this style
without extensions but I love me some
her so I'm going to go ahead and clip
some extensions and really quick and the
trick with this hairstyle is that you
really want to focus the clips on the
bottom half of your head because you
don't want them to be showing up here
like it looks not so good and I've been
there I think we all have all this
extension wires where your track is
showing you don't want that so we want
to focus on the bottom half that way we
have more hair at the top to kind of
cover all of those tracks you guys know
I usually use bellamy and I use the
dirty blonde however I cut those and so
they're shorter than I would like and
I'm just going to use these for today
because I want them to be longer so I
don't know if I'd recommend them there
because they're already shedding a lot
so anyways I'm going to show you guys
how to clip them in it's super simple
I'm just going to turn around do
all right I'm going to section off a
piece of hair right above that and I'm
fully aware that these extensions the
top of them don't match my roots that's
alright because they get covered by the
rest of my hair some people like to
tease their hair before clipping and
extensions however depending on how good
your clips are you don't have to do that
you're not going to create a new part
for these little webs here I'm just
going to clip these in right on top of
where I just clipped in that longer weft
all right so I kind of just stack them
all up like that I think I can fit one
more clipped in all the extensions that
I'm going to be using for this look I'm
not going to clip any in the top area
just because like I said you guys don't
want them to be showing and it's just
more comfortable this way and my hair is
kind of a medium length so it's going to
blend just fine before I move on to the
top part of my hair I'm gonna go ahead
and just wave this lower section really
quickly I'm going to take big sections
I'm picking up my Bellamy six in one
curler and I think this is the biggest
barrel I don't know the size but I'll
put it in the description box for you
guys I'm just going to go ahead and wrap
this and leave it for a few seconds and
do that to the whole bottom section
if you guys want tighter curls than this
then I recommend using a smaller barrel
okay so now we're going to let down the
other part of our hair usually when I'm
doing this hairstyle it's because I'm in
a rush on my hair is kind of dirty so I
don't put too much effort into it like I
said I'm just going to kind of run some
waves through the the top half of my
hair so hot under these like oh my god
okay so I just finished quickly curling
my hair and like I said I am a fan of
waves rather than curls so all I do
after I curl it is I take a brush to my
hair and kind of just loosen those waves
up for those curls just so that I can
have just a really simple wave let me
just say one thing about this hairstyle
it is pretty much like a top knot so if
you guys have tried top knots you know
that the more effort you put in the
worse it looks and then when you just do
it really quickly and you put no effort
in it looks perfect and that's just the
way it goes I don't actually slicked
this part back so I'm just going to show
you guys how I do it you're going to
take your hands and kind of first pull
your hair back then as I pull my hair
back I'm going to use my thumbs to part
down the sides so I'm just going to just
like that
I banal okay so after I have done that
I'm just going to get a little bit of
hair spray I have a lot of baby hairs
you're surprised that there we go
I'm not going to spray a lot I'm just
going to spray a little bit and I'm
going to take my fingers and kind of run
it through if you guys want to you can
use a paddle brush and really slick this
part back but I just like it kind of
loose and messy alright so after you've
done that go ahead and grab an elastic
or a hair tie and just tie that back and
then after you've done that go ahead and
just tighten it up
and then I'm just pulling out a little
little sections of this area just so
that it's like nice and full and then I
also like that messy look sure we've
gotten that part up you don't really
want to see a hair tie because it's not
it kind of takes away from the look it
doesn't make it look that chic and I
have this little bold thing that I wrap
around my ponytail usually however the
last time I wore it it totally like
ripped out parts of my hair it got stuck
and it was terrible as a nightmare so
I'm not wearing it anymore but if you
want to know where it's from it was from
H&amp;amp;M so I'm just going to take a tiny
section of this ponytail from the bottom
and I'm going to hairspray it now what
we're going to do is we're going to wrap
this around art ponytail so I'm going to
start by wrapping it around the hair tie
we want to do this nice and tight so
that it doesn't like slide up and then
you're just going to go ahead and grab
some bobby pins and you're going to pin
it back down in the back make sure you
crisscross the bobby pins because if you
don't then there it's not going to stay
after you've done that go ahead and give
it a nice tight scrunch I like a lot of
volume so the very last step to this
look is grabbing a teasing comb or I
have a just a plain comb here and I'm
going to go ahead and tease at the sides
just so that it's nice and fluffy cuz I
like it like I said a million times
messy and big so I'm going to go ahead
and lift some of this hair here and I'm
just going to start teasing it back
combing it basically just pushing the
hair in the opposite direction up
towards the root it's going to give you
volume
oh just a bit - all right so I think
that's enough I'm not trying to get like
too crazy make sure all that brushed out
just gonna give it a good good spray
alright guys so that is it for my high
pony slash Yorkie hairstyle it kind of
looks like a Yorkie hairstyle if you
guys see how people put bows and their
little Ricky's and I like I hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial and that it
was easy to follow um I also wanted to
quickly mention a lot of you guys asked
me where I get my little heart necklace
from and my mom actually got this for me
in Tokyo a long time ago and I pretty
much wear every single day my mom
decided to get some handmade for some of
my followers because she saw that a lot
of guys were asking about it so we took
it to a jeweler and they are getting
handmade and I've already seen them and
they look exactly like this they're so
beautiful so I'm going to keep you guys
posted on Instagram which is at desi
makeup so you guys can check it out when
they are ready to be you know sold so I
hope you guys are excited about that and
then my other necklace that I'm wearing
here is from I Remi collections and I
will link their Instagram down below as
well so that covers everything for today
I hope you guys enjoy the tutorial and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
