today's video is going to be kind of a
haul kind of a chit chat just kind of
hanging out type of video I'm talking
about things I've been loving stuff like
that
not so much favorites just kind of girl
time you guys know how obsessed I am
with a song but I wanted to share with
everyone else just in case I didn't
already annoying all of you guys the
Justin Bieber song with Jackie O is like
everything and you know what's so funny
is that I've played this song like back
to back to back Stephen wants to kill me
I'm pretty sure everyone on Instagram
wants to kill me but it's so good and
like it's so good I was saying on
snapchat that Justin Bieber needs to hit
me up you guys to tweet him and tell him
like you need to send desi Perkins and
edible arrangements okay so another
thing I've been loving this month is
actually a game the game is on Facebook
and it was on my iPad but now it's like
available for mobile phone so now I'm
like playing even more it's called
pearls apparel and it's kind of like a
hidden-object type of game and the
graphics are just super cool and little
storyboards come up so everything has
like a really cool narrative to it what
I like about the app is it's like super
vintage II I'm really like in love with
vintage anything the scenes are super
vintage II you can play with other
people so I've been playing with Katy
and crispy it's totally free so if you
are interested I'll link the app down
below alright so I went shopping and I
bought a lot of things of course I do
all my shopping online through Ebates
cuz you know I love that money back and
I got just a lot of stuff from different
stores like Bloomingdale's Ulta Sephora
and yeah I think that's about it so I'm
gonna start off with a few things that I
bought from Ulta so these are like
drugstore items I've heard everybody
talk about these brushes and these are
the Real Techniques gold metal
collection brushes so the pixie Wu
sisters created these they are actually
YouTube people YouTube ninjas as well
and they created these beautiful brushes
I've seen so many people talk about them
and I've been like dying to try them but
they were sold out forever so finally I
got them
how beautiful the packaging is it's so
well thought out beautiful gold it looks
expensive and rich and I like that they
go for about twenty-five dollars each
which for a drugstore is a little bit
pricey but honestly like they're really
really in high stresses so I'm at at it
the only thing I will say is that when I
opened one brush it was attached to this
insert but they use like a sticky gluey
type of stuff you know that really
annoying sticky stuff and it kind of
just like gets all over the brush and I
feel like that's the only thing that
cheapens the brush a little bit cuz now
my brush is all gross I'm probably gonna
have to take like alcohol to it or
something but it has like all this
sticky sticky stuff on it this is the
300 brush and it is the tapered blush
brush I love this brush I think it's
perfect for like really swiping
translucent powder maybe a little
highlight it's very small it's very
dense I wouldn't use this for blush I
would probably use it more for like I
said highlight under the eyes or even
like a contour of the other cheekbones
alright so the next brush I picked up
was the flat contour brush this is a 301
and this brush is very very dense so a
lot of product will come off on this I
feel like because these brushes are
synthetic this would work really really
well with a cream contour which I'll get
to later so I really like this I think
for powder maybe it's gonna be a little
too dense for me for my contour but for
cream this would probably be beautiful
and in the last brush that I picked up
was the 100 arched powder brush this one
is Gigantor it's a really really big
powder brush I don't know I just thought
it looked so luxurious and fluffy this
brush is super fluffy it's not as dense
as the other ones so it has a lot of
wiggle room I just feel like it's like
the perfect powder brush alright so
another thing I picked up because all of
you guys kept telling me about this
product and this is the Real Techniques
complexion sponge so it's similar to the
Beauty Blender that I love but so many
of you said
this one was better and that you loved
it so I picked it up I hope you guys are
right because I'm excited to use it I
haven't used this yet but I do hear
great things about it it's a little bit
differently shaped then the
Beautyblender it has that flat edge
which might be really really good for
the under eye area I think I would like
that and then it says high-definition
results and that your base will be
flawless and that sounds good to me
so another thing that I grabbed was the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte I just
wanted to get it back up because I lost
my other one so I ordered a couple
online I am in the shade 107 which is
the fresh B shade and I'm telling you
guys this is the best foundation ever
like ever I love it it's amazing I can't
say enough good things about it
Katie actually discovered this I'll give
her that I'll give her that credit I
remember when she bought it from the
drugstore I looked at it and I was like
I wonder why you would pick this because
the packaging is kind of like I wouldn't
gravitate towards this packaging it
doesn't look like something I would want
I don't know but then she bought a color
that was too dark for her and she gave
it to me and it's fabulous I'm wearing
it right now I've basically been wearing
it every single time I do my makeup and
this is a really really matte foundation
if you have oily skin I recommend it
because I'm really oily around my nose
chin and forehead and I swear my face
holds up so much better when I wear this
foundation so if you're oily I recommend
it it says it's 24-hour wear and I
completely agree it's 24 hours any photo
shoots that I've done recently I've worn
this and my skin has literally
photographed so beautifully it has no
flashback so you know sometimes
foundations can make your face look
white when you take a picture this does
not do that at all
it's amazing and I recommend it and I
think it's somewhere between 12 to 14
dollars but it's around that price range
so Loreal Pro matte is the bomb so the
next thing I picked up is the Maybelline
instant age rewind and this is the dark
circle eraser I'm wearing it right now
no other concealer just this and it's
amazing I love it so if you guys are
looking for a good drugstore buys I
definitely recommend this I recommend
using it with a damp Beauty Blender
because it can get a little
it's too light like I feel like the
Beautyblender really blends it in more
makes it look a little bit more natural
so I recommend this if you guys are
looking for a concealer so then I headed
over to Bloomingdale's online and I
picked up the Laura Mercier loose
translucent setting powder my friend
Abra I'm really on Instagram I always
see her baking or cooking and she told
me that it was the best setting powder
for the under eyes and anywhere that you
wanted to really highlight so I'm really
excited to try this and then another
thing that I got from bloomingdales
is the Laura Mercier highlighter I think
this is new this is called indiscretion
and oh my god it's so pretty which you
guys see it oh okay I'm done but but
really look at this highlight just the
way it comes alone made me want to buy
it and then i swatched it and I was like
yes oh my god I freaking love it how
pretty is that I almost don't want to
use it but I'm gonna use it all over all
over my face this is like a really
really beautiful champagne gold
highlight oh so pretty oh yes have you
ever seen a more luminous wrist I think
it works really well with tan
complexions and if you are more
fair-skinned I would use this over the
whole bronzing area like just sweep it
across the cheeks more as like a
bronzing illuminator I don't think you
have to be really tan for this to be a
highlight but as you guys can see it
does have like like a hint of warmth I'm
so excited about it oh so I forgot to
mention that I also picked up this Mario
but disco drying lotion from Ulta as
well so a lot of people ask me what I
use when I get a breakout and it's
definitely this Mario Bo disco on the
spot drying lotion so it says that
you're supposed to use this after you've
already like attacked a pimple but I use
this even before the minute I see the
sign of anything happening I've put this
on there it's basically like this little
pink powder down here and then it has
like a clear liquid I don't even know
what these are
but I know that they're not supposed to
mix together you supposed to let it sit
like this and what you do is you take a
q-tip and you just dip it down the
bottle down to the pink stuff pull it
back up and then you pop it on all of
your blemishes and I swear this stuff
really dries it up and it's like gone
I've used it for years I think two years
now I've been using this stuff and it's
amazing so if you're looking for
something for your little friends that
pop up this is great so the last two
things that I have here one of them I've
been hearing about all over damn place
really like everyone's been talking
about it this is the Luna sleeping night
oil it says next generation retinoid oil
reduces the pore size we like that it
improves appearance of damaged skin we
like that also and it helps fight
wrinkles and I love that part if you
guys check out Claire Marshalls video
she said it's really really changed her
skin and that she had you know a lot of
problems with acne and stuff like that
and it's like helping with the scarring
so I'm really excited a lot of people
are saying that it's a life-changer for
some reason I feel like because I spent
so much money on it I like want to keep
it in the box it's so stupid
did you guys do that so the last thing
that I bought is the cover FX this is
the contour kit in medium deep
it comes with a highlighting shade and
then I'm gonna say that this is like the
transition shade more of like the
warming of the face and then the contour
shade and it also comes with a nice
cream highlight I've been really loving
cream highlights lately you guys know
look at that whoo you guys know that
I've been using that jouer cream
highlight and I love it because it
really just gives your face just a more
luminous more natural texture than
powders can so I just bought it on
texture alone plus Alma recommended it
so I was like alright she always looks
cut and I like it so I'm gonna buy it so
on that note I have another item this is
something that I've never tried before
but oh my god I'm so excited this is
called
bosha it's a BB cream that's supposed to
bronze your skin so this is what it
looks like and then you just blend it
over your skin but look how much tanner
just made my arm it's so pretty though
it looks so luminous and glowy and
just tan and this has SPF 27 and it's
oil-free so I just wanted to let you
guys know that Ebates you know I've
mentioned Ebates before they're an
online website that has a lot of other
stores under their website so like every
store that I shop out basically Sephora
Ulta Bloomingdale's Nasty Gal misguided
like everything you can think of so
every time you buy a bunch of stuff they
actually give you a percentage of your
money back so the only reason I'm
telling you guys this is because Ebates
is having their 16th birthday
celebration and a lot of the stores are
giving 16 percent cash back so 16
percent of your money that of things you
buy you get cash back and all lists like
all the stores that are doing the 16
percent in the description box this is
going on between May 11th and May 18th
so make sure you guys take advantage
it's kind of like you know how everyone
goes crazy over the Sephora vib sale
this is like that 16 percent cashback is
a lot so I just wanted to let you guys
know thank you guys so much for watching
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked it and subscribe if you aren't
subscribed already and I'll see you guys
in my next tutorial
like a damn it
I can open this broke up out I can't
open anything and you guys hey that's so
