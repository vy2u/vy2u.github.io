pays gradual tan just to give me that
luminous sunkissed glow and feeling a
little bit pale so I'm going to be
placing a lot of products on my face
today so I want to make sure to use a
primer from seeing cover effects and as
you can mattifying primer it's going to
make your pores appear smaller I'm going
to use my Tokyo milk lip elixir to cap
my lips because we are going to be using
in matte lipstick and those can be
drying now I'm going to go in with my
Kevyn Aucoin Foundation and I'm taking a
wet Beauty sponge this is my glam
princess beauty sponge and I'm going to
just push the product into the skin and
just so you guys know before I use these
sponges I literally put them under the
water in the sink and just get them
really wet because it helps make the
foundation look a little bit more
natural taking my honest hacia Beverly
Hills concealer in the shade number two
I'm going to place that under the eyes
with the same sponge and then whatever's
leftover on my sponge I like to kind of
put around the nose
I'm going to take this light shade from
the Anasazi a constant matter and use
that to set the concealer a flake of
your eyes now I'm going to go in with a
mixture of all of these shades from the
same palette and I'm going to just start
contouring my cheekbones and then
bronzing up a little bit of my face with
this and Mac magnetic appeal a skin
finish I found that this Mac skin finish
isn't super pigmented so I'm kind of
just putting it on aggressively to get
it to actually really warm up the skin
I'm just going to go back in with the
Anasazi of contour shape and
and now it's time for blush I'm using
this motives blush I believe the color
is peaches that I will pick in the
description bar down below
so this is pretty much my favorite part
any look which is highlighting and I'm
using back whisper guilt I'm just going
to start loading that on to the high
points of my face
and I'm also going to put it on the tip
of my nose and the Cupid's bow this look
is pretty much just about skin and a
really bright lip so we're going to keep
the eyes simple I'm going in with makeup
geeks shadow in the color shimma shimma
and I'm going to place that as my brow
bone highlight now I'm going to use
Mac's saddle and apply that in the
crease and I'm just doing a really light
wash of this
now I'm going to use my Coastal Scents
eyeshadow brush and I'm going to pack on
that same eyeshadow that we have placed
on our brow bone and I'm putting a
saddle on the lower lash line for a
little definition I got these as such a
tease lashes in my Ipsy glam bag so
they're actually perfect for this look
because they're very natural and
lightweight and that's what we want we
don't have any eyeliner to cover the
band's so now let's add a little bit of
color to this look I'm going to just
place a little bit of powder over my
lips and then I'm going to take melt
cosmetics
bang-bang lipstick and I'm going to
start applying that straight from the
tube
so now to clean up the lips I'm going to
use NYX pencil in the color orange this
is one of my favorite lip liners I just
love the color I decided I need a little
bit more highlight so I'm using nylon by
Mac in the inner corners of my eyes to
give my hair a little fullness I'm going
to use my sexy hair root pump just to
kind of you know make my hair feel alive
again because this heat is really just
making it a little bit flat and that
completes the look I hope you guys
