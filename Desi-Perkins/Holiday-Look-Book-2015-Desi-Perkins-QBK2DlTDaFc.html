so with all the events coming up I
decided to put together a little festive
lookbook for you guys all the outfits in
this video are from Lulu's and I will
link each individual item in the
description box down below first up we
have a classic red dress which is so
beautiful this is actually a two-piece
it's a tube top and a long skirt I love
this because it's definitely gonna make
you stand out in a crowd and because the
dress is bright red I toned it down with
some nude strappy heels
I kept the accessories minimal however
they are statement pieces especially
this earring here which I absolutely
love and to really make the red pop I
also wore these three gold cuffs around
my arm which are also a statement piece
next up we have formal glam this one is
Vavoom sexy it is definitely a really
good dress for New Year's it has a
plunging neckline and a Jessica Rabbit
like slit here at the stress with some
strappy silver sandals and I kept the
accessories out because I just felt like
the dress itself was one big accessory
if you love sequins but the last dress
is a little bit too formal for you you
can try this option which I call mini
glam this is just a mini version of the
last dress only it has more of a bronze
rose gold undertone which is going to
work with a lot of different skin tones
I mixed metals with silver strappy shoes
and some silver studded earrings
this next look I'm calling effortless
sheets only because the stress is
extremely comfortable it's a jersey
material that hugs the body really
nicely it is super flattering because it
has this ruching along the stomach area
as you guys can see right here
I love the neutral taupe shade of this
dress it allows me to wear bolder lips i
pair it the same statement earring
because I loved it so much and I thought
it would go really well with this messy
ponytail it just kind of tied the whole
look together and I went ahead and
paired this dress with new to strappy
heels to keep the legs looking long
since the dress does cut us off at the
knee of course you know I had to have a
little black dress option for you guys
and I thought this one will be perfect
it's very sexy sometimes little black
dresses can get boring but definitely
not this one because it has a very very
sexy detail on the back it's very
backless but it has these really nice
straps that keep it really feminine
since I decided to keep the dark lift I
wanted to balance it out and make it a
little edgy with these strappy heels
which are so cute
and for jewelry I just kept it simple
with this gold drop necklace
so our final look of course is all white
and this is a daring look it has a
plunging neckline and it is a mini so
it's a little bit more risque I find
this dress would be super appropriate
for New Year's if you're going into an
extravagant party I paired it with a
gold drop necklace again and some nude
strappy heels and a gold cuff just
around one wrist to keep it simple
so those are all the looks I have for
you guys I really hope you enjoyed this
video let me know in the comments below

I'll see you guys in my next video happy
