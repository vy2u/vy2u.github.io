seen you guys a lot has changed my hair
has changed and of course my
surroundings have changed I am here at
YouTube headquarters in Tokyo Japan so
that's why it's been a while since I've
put a video up I've just been really
busy it's been really hectic definitely
enjoying it though
cannot wait for you guys to watch videos
so you get to see the beautiful
background it's actually nighttime now
so it's a little hard to see but it is
so gorgeous and the city is just
beautiful I'm filming for you guys today
a holiday look now I know a lot of
people are doing golds and neutrals
though I thought I'd do a look that
played more off pink tones yeah I really
like it so if you guys don't really feel
the pink then you can definitely get
your own glitter and place it on the lid
instead without further ado let's get
onto the tutorial we're gonna start this
look off by applying a base to our lids
to keep our eyeshadow from creasing and
this is Mac soft ochre Paint Pot then
I'm gonna take a white shadow from the
lorac Pro palette and apply that as a
brow bone highlight and drag it down to
the crease I'm gonna go ahead and pick
up saddle by Mac and apply that to the
crease as a transition color to make our
darker colors easier to blend
go ahead and pick up a dark brown shade
this is expresso by lorac and I'm gonna
pop that in the outer corners of my
crease and slowly build it up lightly
blending it into the inner corner of my
eye as I'm working with these dark
colors I like to go back in with my two
to four Mac fluffy brush and just keep
blending it out so that it just looks
seamless
now to top the crease off I'm going to
go ahead and pick up the two to four
brush with a little bit of brown script
by Mac and just kind of blend all of
these shades together and also create a
warm glow around my eye now I'm going to
go in with two two and this is a shadow
from a two-faced palette and I'm going
to pack that onto the lid using a flat
brush
now I'm going to take sugar plum which
is that highlighted color there and it's
just a pretty sparkly purple I'm gonna
pop that in the outer corners of my lids
I'm gonna take makeup Forever's glitter
and number 12 and some glitter adhesive
and just use a synthetic flat brush to
Pat that on to the lid now I'm going to
take nylon by Mac and use that as my
inner corner highlight now that we're
done working with all that glitter it's
safe to pop on our concealer and this is
tarts creaseless concealer take a light
shade powder and set your under-eye
concealer I'm taking ICO's liquid metal
liner and I'm gonna go ahead and give
myself a cat eye with this
I found this pen actually works really
well with glitter
now it's time to pop on your lashes and
these are just some that I picked up
here in Tokyo go ahead and line your
waterline with a black liner and smoke
that out with brown script from Mac I'm
taking the max give me Sun bronzer and
applying that to be hollows of my cheeks
and then applying some Rimmel stay matte
powder just to the center of my face I'm
taking lollipop blush by Too Faced and
I'm going to go ahead and pop that on
the apples of my cheeks and blend it up
towards my temple now line my lips with
Mac's boldly bare lip pencil and then
I'm going to apply it miss that lipstick
also by Mac on top once you finished
applying your lipstick your look is
complete I hope you guys have a
wonderful holiday and I will see you in
my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
