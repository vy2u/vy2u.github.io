so today's video is going to be a hair
tutorial on how I style my newly cut
short hair it's so easy to manage and
I'll show you guys how quickly it is to
style your hair like this
easiest hairstyle I've ever done and it
looks shitty deaky you guys are gonna
love it so if you're interested then
keep on watching I'm starting off with
my hair freshly blown out when I
blow-dry my hair I use a round brush
because if I don't my hair is gonna be
like really frizzy and I just can't be
having that so if you have coarse curly
hair and you have a short hair style
make sure to blow-dry it just to smooth
it out I like it to be nice and smooth I
also like to blow dry the ends inwards
opposed to outwards because you don't
want like this flipping situation you
know when this happens when you have fur
hair this mm-hmm
we don't want that for this hair style
this hair style I blow it inward so that
the end I blew it
make sure to blow dry the ends inwards
because it's going to give you a
straighter appearance and if you need to
run a straightener really quickly
through the ends you can I didn't but
sometimes I do if my hair does that that
weird flippy thing I don't want that
we're gonna get started first thing
you're gonna need oh I think I've
burned something a curling iron and I
like to use one with a clamp for this
it's from Hot Tools it's like the extra
long barrel and it's one in a
quarter-inch Hot Tools is alright like
I'm not the biggest fan of that there's
one at Target from Conor that you could
find which is probably way cheaper
I'm a huge fan of Connie err curling
irons this is just one I already had so
I started using it but for some reason I
feel like Hot Tools curling irons play
me they always break this one so far has
done me good but I'm just putting that
out there because I want you guys to
know how I feel about Hot Tools curling
irons
even though I'm using it in this video
thanks so much I'll make sure to have a
hair clip of a comb to do any back
combing teasing fluffing then the last
thing I usually use is either a
texturizing spray or a light hold
hairspray just to give a little of a
boom to the look next thing we're going
to do is just clip half of the hair up
and out of our face
keep the shorter layers like my short
ones back here are pretty short I don't
curl those I leave them straight because
they're just so short that it doesn't
need to be curled gonna do is take a
small section of hair about an inch this
hairstyle is super easy but there are
some mistakes that people can make to
take away from the effortlessness enter
not towards the ends and then I'm going
to wrap it like this a couple times and
let it go that's it you see how fast I
did that like let me do it again so I'm
going to take it wrap it and let it go
put basically no heat at the ends I just
ran it through really quickly so a tip I
can give you guys also is on the bottom
layers of your short hair see how I have
the barrel really close to the root of
the hair I'm doing that only on the
bottom layers because I want the most
volume and by lifting the root at the
bottom the layers that you put on top
are going to sit on top of all the
lifted root and make it look fluffier so
just make sure you're paying attention
to how quickly I'm running the curling
iron through the hair I'm not holding it
for a long time I'm doing it so fast so
you'll see really quick hold it the most
at the base and then just as you curl
release and it gives you this you see it
gives you like just this loose wave and
the good thing about this is that you're
not holding the curl for a long time so
this hairstyle takes no time to do
holding it running it through release
now you guys can see it's starting to
get that bend that we want and be aware
that it will fall throughout the day so
if it looks too curled for the Ben look
just know that it's going to relax
and it's going to be
eat perfect because with short hair we
do tend to fluff it a lot throughout the
day and the more you touch the hair the
more the curl falls out so this is
pretty much what we got going on right
here see I'm holding most of the heat
and then I'm so quickly just pulling it
through the rest of the hair so fast
so as you're curling it you could always
tousle the hair a little bit just to
loosen any waves if they're too much do
you see how we're starting to get this
really nice texture see how much space
I'm keeping between the curls this is
how much space you want in order to
create a wave let me show you what not
to do you don't want to do this like too
close do you see how the hair is too
close now that's going to give you more
of a curl and you don't want that so
make sure you in the barrel you keep the
distance of the hair at least an inch
and a half in between to give you a
loose enough wave so now we're going to
go ahead and do the top half of this
hair the technique is almost exactly the
same the only thing I don't do is hold
the curl at the root because this is the
top so you're going to see everything on
the top so I just run it through once to
smooth it out and then do the same thing
just one curl and release and I don't
only section it out I just kind of go
random pieces really fast release Blinn
quickly and then release before you get
to the end and you guys know I've got
these bangs I'm going to try to curl
them into the hair because I don't want
them to look banky so you're just going
to keep repeating that motion until you
get like the desired texture
so as I'm curling I like to stop look at
the hairstyle fluff it around really
play with it to see how it's all molding
together
I do have more broken hairs on this side
like these aren't layers kids these
aren't layers this is broken hair from
bleach so I try to blend them in because
I don't want it to look like I have
layers I want to kind of just curl them
in so now that piece doesn't look like a
layer it looks like one long piece even
though it's a broken piece of hair so
one of the mistakes I see when someone's
doing this hairstyle is just they hold
the curl here like this and then leave
the end out it'll show you what that's
gonna look like that's gonna look like
this if you do it that way which is not
what you want at all
as I saw my hair my part changes I
decided to put the part this way because
it looked more effortless and I like to
give it a tuck behind the ear there's
really no curl there's just a bend now
what I like to do is take this teasing
comb and give myself a fluff at the root
just kind of backcomb it do you see how
much blooming I just got right now Ballu
me and I'm not neat about this either I
just go in and fluff random areas I
can't even tell you where this comb is
from because Steven where'd you get this
comb hmm last
Stephen stole this from the hotel
fluff it they're good fluff grab your
hairspray I'm going to lay my edges
Shayla where you at girl she always
tells me she's gonna lay my hedges so
that is it that's it for the hair
tutorial it looks super effortless it's
really quick especially if you have
short hair it's already such a
manageable hairstyle once you guys get a
hang of it you're going to be doing your
hair in five minutes
Cinco minutos honestly I'm still not
regretting cutting my hair I haven't
regretted it yet I'll let you guys know
when that time comes because we all know
that time comes when girls regret
cutting their hair but so far no regrets
I'm still loving the hairstyle
I feel so chic EVP chiki chiki if you
guys recreate this hairstyle don't
forget to tweet me I'll see you guys in
the next tutorial bye alright guys so
cannoli Harper our pile right jet but
again when I wake up in the morning you
