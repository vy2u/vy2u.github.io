today's video is going to be a little
bit different this is going to be a
video about what apps I use to edit my
photos and how to take really good
makeup photos and/or selfies or whatever
you're really taking pictures of I know
that what I started doing makeup and
trying to post good photos they were
coming out so bad you spent all this
time doing your makeup and then you're
like why does it look like crap it's
very frustrating I totally understand I
get a lot of questions about what camera
I use what settings I have the camera on
in particular and what apps I use to
edit my photos disclaimer this is not a
video just about editing a selfie it is
to help people in their business that is
anything to do with a bomb-ass photos
you guys are interested in learning some
tips and tricks then let's just go ahead
dive right into the video things first
is camera you do not need a fancy camera
you could definitely use your iPhone
iPhone takes really good photos the sony
a 5100 i have it on this mini tripod
because i use this to log in the camera
there's a built-in skin softener which
is really nice because it makes your
whole face look pretty glowy without
looking like play-doh does have levels
of skin softening so low medium and high
I'll usually have it on low
sometimes medium if I'm feeling extra
rough this one has a flip screen so you
can see everything that you're taking a
photo of settings I have it on our
intelligent Auto which just does the
work for you in intelligent Auto you can
mess with the brightness of the photo
vividness so if you have a really pop in
a shadow and I want it to be a little
bit more vivid and show true to color
without the flash drowning it out you
can mess with those settings the lens
that you see here is the lens that comes
with the camera then of course the
iPhone there's not much I need to say
about this the camera quality is amazing
you guys probably know because a large
percentage of you have iPhones when you
are taking a makeup photo with an iPhone
I recommend using the back camera the
front-facing camera may make you look
better because it's lower quality so you
may be like s girl
yes but this one will take better makeup
photos especially if you're doing this
as a profession and you want to post
something
more professional other than that
there's not much I can say about the
iPhone camera number one most important
thing for taking a photo number one I
promise you this is the most important
thing and it's lighting I find a lot of
people when they want to take a photo
they face away from the light to take it
and I'm like girl what you do and like
you got to face the light the light is
your friend when I started doing makeup
photos I took the worst makeup photos
because I was not understanding the
concept of lighting there's something
called soft light and there's something
called hard light you always want soft
light so an example of this would be
light coming through a window because
the light is bouncing off surfaces and
then diffusing in through the window
making you look fabulous if you do
photos and hard light which would be
like direct sunlight the Sun is just
like beaming on you it's gonna have
harsh shadows it's not gonna look cute
you're gonna see every single like pore
in your face and it's just gonna be
rough it's gonna be a rough life you
want soft light always so next I'm gonna
talk to you guys about composition of a
photo you want to be conscious of like
what's in the background the angles
you're going at how you see the photo
you definitely don't to have like your
vacuum in the background of your makeup
photo also angles my angle is usually
just a little bit higher I don't ever
want to be down here because that's not
cute I'm gonna go ahead and take a few
photos using my sony a 5100 and I will
show you guys how I edit the photo to
make it look the best it can't do a
little little like little like I work a
lot with my hands it just makes the
picture a little bit more appealing
alright guys so I'm quickly going to
show you how I edit my makeup photos
chicken claws in so don't mind the
amount of emails I have to read so my
all-time favorite app hands down is
facetune what you're going to do is
import any photo so the first thing I do
is look at my photo and think alright
what do I want to fix since the a 5100
has a skin smoother built in the skin is
looking pretty smooth but if I want to
smooth anything out there is the tool
called smooth so I'm going to click on
that tool zoom in
this area here we can just go ahead and
you know give it a little judge I don't
like to let go in all hard though like
me you don't want to do that just do
like little taps just little smudges
here and there because you still want to
be able to see your skin you don't want
to look too photoshopped however it
happens to the best of us and sometimes
we go a little crazy sometimes if I
haven't threaded my moustache my
moustache I'll go in there and give a
little smooth you know cuz nobody wants
to see that nobody needs to see that so
that's the smooth tool another good tool
in facetune would be patch which is this
one right over here
patch is key when you have a pimple that
you want to get rid of because you don't
want to just smooth over a blemish let's
just get this dot out of here so just
for the sake of the tutorial I'm zooming
in on this right here this little guy
I'm going to go into patch and just tap
over that this circle is where we are
currently this one is whatever you want
to match it's going to just copy and
paste this piece of skin over this so
that it still looks like real skin you
can't even tell and it's gone and while
you're editing you can keep pushing this
button here and this will show you the
work you've done pimple pimple gon
pimple pimple gone you guys are gonna
look at my pictures a lot differently
now right you're gonna be like oh girl I
know you bees and facetune I'm not
hiding it I'm here sharing all my
secrets with you guys so this is another
helpful trick for a makeup photo the
lash line can be such a pain because you
could have the most amazing makeup photo
and eyelash glue on your lash line or
something weird on your lash line could
ruin it but we could fix it I don't
really have too much of a bad lash line
here but there is some glitter fallout
in this area as you guys can see there's
a feature called tones this button is
picker this means you're gonna pick
whatever color you want to replicate I'm
trying to get rid of these little white
specks on my lashes so I'm gonna click
the color of the lashes
I'm gonna hit tones and just go over
those little dots sometimes you have to
do it more than once but I like to keep
it looking like somewhat natural like so
I'm just going to go over all the little
white dots with that tone and it's just
gonna blend with the lashes a lot better
this is the lash line now this is the
lash line before do you see the
difference yes girl details details
is really nice especially when you have
glitter on the eyes
sometimes your glitter won't show up in
your photos that's an issue for us
because you know glitters a pain in the
ass to put on to begin with and if it's
not showing in the photo it's really
upsetting details will bring out the
glitter I don't like to like rub it like
I said everything in moderation because
you want it to look as real to the photo
as possible I'll just quickly go over it
and like light strokes and it'll bring
out the glitter detail there's also
whiten whiten is amazing if maybe you
want to whiten your smile you could fix
redeye D focus this one is nice I can't
really show you with this particular
photo say you're having OTD and the
background is looking crazy you want to
take it out of focus you can use D focus
and just make the background blurry and
keep yourself in frame so that's pretty
much everything this is what I would do
to a photo just to make it stand out and
make the focal point of the whole photo
the makeup save to camera roll thank you
so much next we're gonna go into the app
called in light which is another amazing
at Oh oooh this is embarrassing
do you guys remember this me my maid
Katie
me it was I was really funny I put it on
Twitter I made it in in light you can
make memes in this app which is great
get out of that okay let's go to this
picture I'll just show you guys some of
my favorite because this app could go
forever and ever and ever there's so
many things you could do on here but
let's just go to adjust your image you
can make your image more vivid obviously
that's too much but Coldplay's Harper
this is an especially good app if you
make thumbnails for YouTube videos or if
you want to put two images together you
can do some cool stuff so let's just go
you image target it shows you how to do
everything - just in case you know you
pick the area that you want to target
say my eye shadow because we're doing a
makeup pick it's gonna pick the whole
eyeshadow area and you can go to tones
so in tones they're saturation contrast
and hue for some reason say you want
your saturation of your picture didn't
turn out that good in your makeup you
don't want your face to be orange but
your eyeshadow didn't come out like it
is in person you could target that area
and manage it through the target up
target is amazing if you want to make
your body look tan hen in pictures let
me show you guys actually an OOTD
picture so here's me back in that thing
up this is what's cool there's something
called image tools mixer this is one of
my favorite things say I have like five
different poses or three that I want to
put together you click mixer and then
you're gonna click the photo you want to
add to the photo so it could have been
my face but let's just do the same one
so here we go we're just gonna make it
big then you go to tools and you go to
erase this is like Photoshop all I'm
gonna do is erase around my body and
it's so smart it actually really reads
the edges of the image really well I
made my street style look book with this
the thumbnail I put a bunch of me
together with different outfits and made
a really cool thumbnail and then you
could like move yourself around you know
like oh I want to be over here no
actually I want to be over here you
could just erase everything else in the
photo so say there's two poses that you
want to put together you could do it
this way
let's go into text tools you can go into
text type something and let's just say
that I was making this into I don't know
a thumbnail for a YouTube video I would
say lookbook done there's a lot of cool
text on here and then maybe change
the color do red so you guys can see it
better and then you can make it bigger
you know what ups this app has really
good filters if you are interested this
app is awesome especially for youtubers
to make thumbnails if you want to do
OOTD pictures this one's great you can
adjust you know basic things like
clarity of your photos you can adjust
hue saturation contrast things like that
alright guys so that's pretty much
everything these are the two apps that I
use all the time to edit my photos in
light and facetune I think they're
really good for landscape photos so
Instagram photos for your professional
makeup photos whatever it is that you're
doing that's none of my business but
these are the best apps ever I hope I
answered all your questions
facetune takes the cake number one
alright guys so that was it for this
video I really hope that you found it
useful especially for those of you who
are makeup enthusiasts and are trying to
get you know just some good content
photos out there I linked the apps and
the camera in the description box if you
guys are interested in those check them
out down there that wraps everything up
so I'll see you guys in my next video
bye honestly I've removed people from
the backgrounds of my photos with patch
I can remove a whole person
I could probably remove a whole building
it's a little scary what I can do with
this app like I would be taking photos
of my chest and not my makeup and we
can't have that
or can we Harper hey so these are the of
course okay a photo yeah
oh my ass is falling asleep
shut up but I Papa Papa Papa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
