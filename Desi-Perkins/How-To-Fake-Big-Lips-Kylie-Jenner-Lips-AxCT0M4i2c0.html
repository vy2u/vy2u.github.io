today because a lot of you requested
that I show you how to over line your
lips now I know this may seem like an
easy task over lining your lips but back
in the day I tried to over line my lips
and I was like oh like it looked
terrible I looked like a duck like my
just was so bad and I was like Oh
overlining lips is not for me it doesn't
suit my face like I'm never doing it
again and I made the mistake which is
not that obvious to over line the
entirety of my lip so I was over lining
like every the whole lip line so I
practiced and I loved the way it looked
and I came to work and crispy was like
wow her lips look good and I was like
thank you so I just wanted to kind of
show you guys how I overlined my lips
I'm sure everybody has different
techniques but hopefully this will work
for you if that's something that you're
looking to do because I mean not
everyone's gonna go out and get lip
injections but a lot of people do want
that like Angelina Jolie I don't know
why I'm doing that
so the first thing you're gonna need to
make yourself look like jay-z or Kylie
Jenner is a lip pencil and this is the
LA color endless semi-permanent lip
pencil these have quickly become my
favorite lip liners I used to use Mac
pretty much just Mac but these are so
much better than Mac and they're only $5
maybe holo the one over lining your lip
here's what you need to know and this is
where I went wrong in the beginning when
I tried to over line my lips in the past
you really want to focus the over lining
in the center of your lip so above the
Cupid's bow and below this part of your
lip here and you always want to meet the
lipliner as you get down to the corners
of your mouth you want to meet the lip
liner to the natural lip line that way
your mouth doesn't look like
and what we're basically gonna do is
create a new bits bow
I'm gonna go slightly above my Cupid's
bow though so I'm following the sheep
but I'm just taking it up higher
okay so here's a rough shape I know it
looks like there's a butt on my upper
lip this is where my natural lip line is
right here and I went pretty far above
it and then I also have this issue where
this side of my mouth actually goes out
rounder and this side goes out a little
bit more straight so if you guys have
this problem with your lips you can
totally use a lip liner to correct that
so as you guys can see I'm still
slightly over lining at this point but
now I'm gonna meet it back to my natural
lip line just like that sometimes I find
it difficult to line my lips cuz I have
this pretty gnarly scar here I don't
know if you guys have ever noticed it
when I was 12 I went ice skating for my
birthday and I had fallen and the person
in front of me kicked their foot up and
I basically in the face with an ice
skate blade it was terrible up okay then
I look back and just make sure
everything is even cuz there's times
where one side will look a little bit
different I'm gonna try to round this
one out a little bit more
the empty space between where I just
drew a new lip and my actual lip I take
my lip liner and I kind of load the lip
liner in that area because I have this
theory where like the more lip liner you
layer on it like raises raises the lip
line so it looks more natural I don't
know if that's if that's legit or not
but I do it anyway
I heard that Marilyn Monroe her makeup
artist used to actually layer several
lipsticks on top of each other and that
she thought it made her lips look bigger
so that's kind of where I got that
concept so now that we have finished the
top we're going to do the bottom so the
same thing applies to the bottom you're
going to want to over line just the
center so just under the lip and you're
gonna meet the lip liner to your natural
lip line in the corners
they're already starting to look pretty
big I like where this is going
so now I'm gonna speak like this sorry I
look you know like I did in like eighth
grade or ninth grade
so I find what works the best when over
lining your lips is using maps so if you
have a matte lipstick or a matte lip
paint like this they work the best for
me because here's my theory if you use
gloss or anything shiny even satin it'll
highlight the ridge of your natural lip
line anything that's forward reflects
light so of course your natural rip your
natural lip line comes forward more than
where you just over lined your lips so
that part is gonna capture light if you
use anything with any type of gloss so
what I overlined my lips I only use
mouth stuff using Joseph's colors berry
me which is my fave you guys know
similar things to this would be the Lime
Crime Velveteen or you can just use a
regular matte lipstick so this there's
no trick to this I literally just put it
on see like even now this isn't dry yet
it'll dry matte but even now that it's
looks kind of shiny you can see what I
mean like this is reflecting light after
I've applied the lip paint let it dry a
little bit I'm going to go back in with
the lip liner one more time and redefine
that shape
I'm taking a small oh there's an eyelash
stuck to this leave it to me to have
eyelashes stuck everywhere I'm gonna
take my favorite concealer brush this is
my makeup geek and I'm just taking a lot
of foundation that's close to my skin
tone I'm gonna put a little bit on the
edge of my brush and just kind of start
lining the outer part of my lip
this helps also make your bold lip look
really sharp sure you blend that out you
don't to have like concealer lines
around your lips okay so that's the last
step and you have a new set of oops
it's the Kylie Jenner pose what does she
do she like alright guys so this is the
finished look I really hope you enjoyed
