hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm gonna do a quick tutorial on
strobing strobing because all of you
guys have been requesting it and also
because yes told me to do it because he
says the new hot thing that all the kids
are doing these days right Jeff hmm
really strobing is just highlighting
intense highlighting it's like
highlighting to like another level it's
layering highlights on top of each other
to give your face a really intense glow
as you guys can see it's pretty crazy I
mean I love it it's just all about light
it's very youthful it's really nice for
the summer so if you guys are interested
in how to do this strobing technique
then keep on watching with strobing you
pretty much just want to layer a crap
ton of highlighters starting off with a
cream because I find that when I apply a
cream highlighter first everything else
sticks to it a lot more and the
highlighter is going to be a little bit
more vibrant just like your eye shadow
if you apply a base a cream base is
going to really hold on any powder so
that's what you want since we're gonna
like intensely highlight right now my
favorite cream highlight is buys you a
this one right here what I like about
this highlighter is it's gonna give us
just a really nice Sheen to the skin so
when you move it just looks really
healthy not super sparkly I'm gonna use
my finger to apply this just because it
is a cream and I feel like cream
highlighters works so much better with
your hands but you want to apply the
highlight anywhere the light hits so as
you guys can see since I have the
filming lights on me you can see that
the light is hitting above my brow bone
on my cheekbones also on the bridge of
my nose any part of your face that you
would like to come forward that's what
you want to accentuate with a highlight
so say you want higher cheekbones you're
going to want to apply a highlight right
here on the tops of your cheekbones you
can feel this bone right here it's
almost like the shape of a C so that's
where you want to apply the highlight in
the shape of a C you can feel it
obviously the bone keeps going but we're
going to stop right here about right
where your pupil starts that's where I
stopped but you don't have to some
people like to keep it going here but I
like to keep it here especially because
a lot of people have pores in this area
and if you put highlight right here it
will accentuate pores
we don't want to do that I'm also going
to apply this above the brow bone right
here where the light is hitting also on
the tip of the nose if you want to give
yourself a more lifted button type of
nose then you want to just put it right
at the tip it's going to lift the nose
up slightly it's going to give you the
illusion of a nose lift I have a bump
right here on my nose so for my profile
you can see a little bump right here so
because I have a bump I do not want to
apply highlight over the bump because if
you apply highlight over a bump on the
nose it's gonna bring the bump forward
even more you don't want to bring the
bump forward I mean unless you do but I
don't so where I don't apply highlight
here I will apply the highlight right
before the bump and this is going to
lift this part of my nose so it'll just
it'll kind of give the illusion that
there is no bump because it'll lift the
part that dips in right before it see
what I'm saying something fun we get in
it so I'm just applying it right here
you also want to apply a little bit of
this on the chin now I've given myself a
base highlight that looks just really
really dewy because it's a cream product
so if I move my face around you can see
I applied you know on the top of my
eyebrows cheekbones nose and chin after
we've laid down our cream highlight
we're going to intensify a little bit
more all over the face using this
natascha to known a glow palette this is
in the shade one light and I'm taking a
Mac 168 with it this is going to
intensify it just a little bit but it's
also going to set that cream for you
guys my face is lit right now the last
step to strobing is just hitting those
areas that you want the most intense
highlight so this we have like an
all-over sheen now we want to hit just
right here at the tops of the cheekbones
on the brow bone inner corner highlight
tip of the nose Cupid's bow
you want those highlights to really
stand out and pop I love doing this part
this is my favorite part of highlighting
always so I'm kind of torn between two
highlighters that are equally as
beautiful and bright this is the Jaclyn
hill collab with becca cosmetics in the
shade champagne pop and this is mary lou
manizer by the balm i don't know which
one to use because i love both of these
highlighters so I'm deciding I'm going
to use champagne pop so the brush I'm
going to be using is the Sigma soft
blend concealer brush this is my
favorite brush to highlight the tops of
the cheekbones it just kind of fits
perfectly in this area I want my
highlight to be the strongest right here
so BAM oh you see that now we just have
some poppin ass cheek bones going on
right here
okay picking a pencil brush for this and
I'm going into the highlighter I'm going
to apply this right here
oh honey also taking that and applying
it to the tip of the nose so I apply it
kind of heavy and then I take my finger
and try to kind of take some of it away
so I don't look like I just have a you
know a spot of highlight on my nose I
kind of want it to melt into the skin
more I'm going to take a little bit of
that and apply it to this area here
that's going to really draw attention to
the eyes looks really nice and pretty
I'm also going to apply a little bit of
the champagne pop with the pencil brush
just above the brow like right here
but then I'm gonna lend it out
the bigger brush see it I'm strobing
strobe and rohban let's see like that
job looks good right and then the last
part I'm going to highlight is my
Cupid's bow and I usually really
exaggerate this part also this is going
to make you have an appearance of a
fuller upper lip you're just going to
kind of bring it forward and make it
look cute I'm going to follow the top of
the lip line and bring it up the little
cupid bow area just lightly it just kind
of gives a little bit more lift to the
upper lip which is nice last step if you
really really want to intensify the
highlight this is the best tip I can
give you guys mac fix+
this stuff is so good for intensifying
highlights because what it's going to do
is make the powders settle into the skin
and make it look more dewy which is what
you want with highlighter because if it
looks powdery then it's not as glowy so
I like to just kind of take this and
spray it just on the areas that I
highlighted this is the cucumber one
it's like a spa it smells so good
this is what it should look like
it's highlight to the extreme that is
all strobing is this is pretty much it
it's just a very intense layering of
highlights right jarvan
