today's video is going to be a quick one
on how to do a faux bob which is what I
have here this is more of a lob it's
like a long bob that's what they call it
a lob I actually have been wondering
like should I cut my hair should I not
because I really like the bob lob style
I feel like it's super chic but my hair
girls really slow so I've been very
scared to actually cut it I was at the
99-cent store recently if you guys
follow me on snapchat you saw that I
found a mechanism for a 99 cents by
Connor that gives you a faux bob I tried
using it it made my head look like a
mushroom head it doesn't look good on
its own and then the wheels started
turning in my head and I thought oh my
god what if I do this then maybe it'll
look more realistic so I figured it out
and I posted it you guys all wanted to
see a tutorial on it it's kind of a lot
of work for fake short hair but if you
don't want to take the plunge to cut
your hair then why not right so I'm
going to walk you through the steps I
will tell you guys right now that this
unfortunately the way that I did it only
will work if you have layers in your
hair so if you have layers like I do
that are the length of the log that I
want it's a lot easier I'm sure that you
could tease your top layers shorter but
it's a lot more work so just putting
that out there
works better if you have layers so if
you're interested in this faux bob then
keep on watching this is from the
99-cent store it's by Conor and it's
just a faux bob contraption so what it
is is basically just in a large elastic
hair tie type thing it is held together
by this little clip and there's a
smaller side in a larger side what you
want to do first is section off this top
layer of my head just around the crown
these baby hairs going all over the
place now that I have the crown of my
hair up I'm going to apply this Eva NYC
dry shampoo to gather any excess oil and
this can also be used for teasing
Dunham's I just want to rub it into your
scalp I take the smaller side and what
we want to do is just put it in a normal
ponytail you want to take the ponytail
and drag the ponytail down to the length
that you want your bob to be so see what
I'm saying like if you want it to be
this short you're going to drag it down
that far then once you have the length
of your bob you're going to take the
bigger hair tie section and you're going
to just put it around your neck like so
you're going to go ahead and tuck in the
back of your pony like all of your long
hair and you're gonna take this after
and just pop it on like a regular
headband like this so you can get an
idea of what this product would look
like if you didn't do my technique
it would look ridiculous you would look
like a mushroom head so this top layer
is now gonna come down oh these are my
top layers that I just dropped over the
mushroom lob the purpose of the thing
actually the like Conair thing actually
really works well to keep the volume
under the lob so or bob so that is what
it's good for
next I'm gonna take some extension these
are old Bellamy extensions that I
actually just cut they were already like
gross you know you can only have
extensions for so long so I ended up
cutting them I didn't cut them a special
way I literally took like wire cutters
and I was just like chop pick up the top
layers
I'm just going to go ahead and clip in
at the extension clipping it in right
under and then you can just flop the
hair back over to cover the extension so
this is going to make it look like you
really cut your hair because of the you
know the chop here do the same thing on
the other side so here's another
extension that I cut I'm just going to
pop it in right over here so I'm just do
the same thing and once again pop that
over so I have one more piece for the
back the concept is the same you just
want to clip this last piece in back
here hah alright I definitely need to
style it
take my Conair infinity Pro curler and
start taking random sections and just
curling them what I do to get that like
effortless wave is I curl the top at the
base but then I leave the ends out and I
don't really put a lot of heat and time
on the ends so I'm just going to curl
really quickly through the hair leave it
in for two seconds if you want like more
of an effortless wave kind of like how
Kim K wears are here all the time it's
not really a curled look it's more of
just like a bend you're just gonna keep
doing this and I like to grab random
sections that way it looks more natural
all right so as you can see I just kind
of put like a bend in the hair doesn't
look like it's super curled if you want
to add more texture you can use
something like a sea salt spray this one
is by a toffee oh and it is the sea salt
spray infused with algae extract I like
my bob to be really messy so if you like
that then I would use a peach spray then
you have your faux bob hair oh that's it
that's how you get a messy style faux
bob I really hope that you enjoyed the
tutorial and that you found it helpful I
know it's definitely a lot of work for
fake Bob but I mean I'm really proud of
myself okay I'm pretty proud that I made
it look like I actually cut my hair you
guys recreate this lob then make sure to
tweet me and show me your beautiful
picture let me know in the comments
below if you guys think that I should
really cut my hair this short because
I'm kind of 5050 right now and I'm not
sure where to go with it so your opinion
really matters to me so let me know in
the comments below
the way I see it is this length is
really not that short and then I could
always put extensions in anyways which
is what I do anyways so I would love to
hear your guys's opinion on what you
think of this length hair see you guys
in my next one
Oh oh my god this looks crazy like whoo
my foreheads burning look it you can see
it you guys are probably look thinking
like pop you're crazy this is a lot of
work for fake hair
Chris Beck I need to curl these like
what's happening my burn is coming
through welted sure you cover all your
tracks want to walk around looking
ratchet you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
