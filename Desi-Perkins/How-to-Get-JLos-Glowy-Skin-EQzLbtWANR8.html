I films the JLo glow inspired makeup I
think it's such a gorgeous look it looks
beautiful on everybody and it's such a
great makeup look coming into winter
because you know in the summer we have
the heat that makes our skin dewy and
the Sun that makes us tan and we just
have such beautiful skin in the summer
and then in the winter we start to get a
little bit into the dry skin and it
starts to get a little bit dull
sometimes and pale so this look just
kind of brings back all of those
attributes to your skin and yeah it just
makes you look fresh and youthful and
just like a disco ball because you're so
sparkly so anyways if you guys like this
look then just keep on watching bye
alright guys so I am just prepping my
skin here by using Mac's strobe cream
and this just gives you that dewy
radiant look some people mix it with
their foundation but I just put it on
the high points of my face
my eyebrows are already done but I have
no makeup on the rest of my face I'm
taking my giorgio armani luminous silk
foundation and a damp Beauty Blender
first I'm going to use my fingers to
apply the foundation straight on to the
skin so that the blender doesn't absorb
all of my product and then I'm going to
take the damp blender and just start
working that all into my skin
by using the Beautyblender that's damp
it actually just really melts the
product into your skin giving you that
flawless finish and it also makes it
look a little bit more like skin now I'm
going to take my Tarte cosmetics
creaseless concealer which you all know
that I love it definitely helps me with
my dark circles and first I applied it
with my finger to warm up the product
and then I'm just going to blend that
all in with the blender once more I'm
going to go in with my Maybelline
instant age rewind dark circle eraser
and I love this product to highlight so
basically I'm using this to highlight
all of the high points of my face this
is my under eyes the bridge of my nose
my forehead and then a little bit on my
Cupid's bow as well as my chin I love
this product because it definitely sets
to a powder finish so it helps with
creasing under the eyes and it prevents
that and of course take your blender and
blend that all in
now I'm gonna go in with my Bobby Brown
Foundation stick in the color almond and
this is what I use to tan up my skin so
you can definitely use it to contour
heavily but I'm going to blend it out
really softly so that it just gives my
face an all-over tan I'm using my Sigma
P 88 brush just to blend the nose out so
it doesn't look so harsh and of course
I'm going to go in with a blender again
and just kind of make it look more
natural I'm going to blend out the rest
of my face using a Mac 130 brush and
this is just a really small stippling
brush so any brush that you guys have
like this will do and really feather out
all of that foundation into your
hairline your jawline and your
cheekbones just to give you that
sunkissed look
now one of my favorite products of the
month is this NYX liquid illuminator and
this is just such a gorgeous product I
am absolutely in love with it you can
definitely mix it with your foundation
however I just like to place it on the
high points of my face because I don't
want my whole face to to be super
shimmery
now that we've done all of our liquid
products I'm just setting my under eye
concealer with my Maryland beauty powder
you guys could use any powder that's a
few shades lighter just to keep all
those areas nice and bright and just use
patting motion so that you don't move
around any products go ahead and take
your favorite matte bronzer I'm using
the one from NYX and I'm using this with
a Mac 109 brush to actually define my
cheekbones whereas with the foundation
we were just giving ourself and all-over
tan take a highlighter of choice I'm
using the one from Mac it's called soft
and gentle I love the way this
highlighter works with the NYX
illuminator it just gives your face the
most beautiful glow
I'm applying Mac's peachy-keen with my
109 brush again to the apples of my
cheeks and blending that up towards the
hairline
now I'm taking vanilla by Mac and just
highlighting my brow bone with this
I'm taking a large fluffy brush and the
color saddled by Mac and I'm going to
just create a really soft blended halo
effect around my eyes through the crease
then I'm taking Swiss chocolate and I'm
going to just define the crease a tad a
bit more but still nothing too dramatic
I'm now going to pack on max wood winked
I shadow all over my lid and this color
is so gorgeous it's definitely one of my
favorites
after I've packed that shadow on I'm
just going to take a fluffy brush and
blend out the edges
now it's time to highlight the inner
corners of our eyes so what I like to do
is take a matte white eyeshadow and this
is from the lorac Pro palette and I like
to create a halo around my inner corner
first then take a damp pencil brush with
nylon from Mac and just place that right
in the inner corners to give your eyes
that extra pop whatever's left over on
my brush I like to use to accentuate my
Cupid's bow going back into saddle and
I'm just going to run that under my lash
line I'm going to now line my waterline
with Tarte cosmetics inner rim
brightener this is a skin tone colored
liner and it's made just for the inner
rim so it stays put and this will
definitely brighten up your eyes I'm
going to go ahead and apply my lashes
and mascara off camera magic
now I'm going to line my lips with this
pink lady lip liner by motives cosmetics
time for lipstick so I'm going to apply
my favorite drugstore lipstick which is
Rimmel nude delight the consistency of
this is so buttery and it makes your
lips feel super hydrated then for the
final touch I'm taking motives lip gloss
in toasty delights and I'm just going to
apply that all over my pout finishing
off the look I hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial I will see you in my next
video
all righty I'm done okay that's a wrap
no you're not off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
