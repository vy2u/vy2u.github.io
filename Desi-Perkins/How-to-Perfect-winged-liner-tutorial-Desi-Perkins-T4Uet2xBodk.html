as you can see by the title I'm finally
doing my how-to winged aligner video you
guys know I like my liner nice and sharp
and pretty dramatic and I get so many
questions on how I get the wing so today
I'm going to show you exactly what I do
to get my eyeliner to look like this
and I also wanted to say that if you are
struggling with winged eyeliner let me
tell you everyone does
I struggle sometimes you don't see it
because I edit it out but I do and there
are times where I swear off in the video
my makeup will be perfect and then when
I get to the eyeliner I'll just mess up
and sometimes I just give up and I'm
like this videos not going to see the
light of day because my whole makeup
just got ruined so if you are struggling
and your eyeliner doesn't come out
perfect
it's fine it happens to everybody I
don't care if you're the best makeup
artist in the world sometimes it's just
very difficult so just keep practicing
and it'll become easier and easier the
more that you practice so if you guys
are interested in how I do winged liner
then keep on watching so there are
definitely different ways to do eyeliner
there's different mediums like gel or
liquid or pencil or even powder and
there's definitely different brushes so
the two brushes I like are either an
angled brush or a liner brush and these
are both from zoeva the angled one is
the 317 and the liner is the 315 so for
my eyeliner today I'm going to use gel
and this one is by Tarte and this is in
the shade black but I'm also going to go
over that with liquid and this is from
NYC the reason I like to use both gel
and liquid is because it gives you a
much darker liner and I also find that
after you put the gel if you put the
liquid over top it just gives you such a
crisp line so what I like to do is take
the brush that I'm going to do my
eyeliner with and I like to hold it from
the edge of my nostril up until the tail
of my brow that is a good trick in order
to figure out your angle so I'm going to
go into my
angled brush and I'm just going to dip
it into the gel liner and you're going
to want to start a line from the lash
line right here just the lower lash line
kind of follow that as your guide and
you're going to pull it up towards the
tail of your brow now imagine that your
lower lash line has a line connecting to
the tail of your brow and they're just
going to meet right over here but we're
not going to take it that far although
sometimes I do when I get crazy with my
liner so first create that line as your
guide so you're going to flip your brush
the other way like this that's why it's
easy because an angled brush already has
that shape so flip your angled brush and
come right back down into the lash line
like a triangle you want to just fill in
all the empty space in that triangle
that we just created and also fill in
any gaps between the lash line and the
liner because you definitely don't want
to open your eyes and see skin showing
through anywhere in this area right here
so next you're going to want to just
take the product and follow the natural
shape of your eye and you can make this
area as thin or as thick as you want
just like any other part of the eyeliner
and I like to make it pretty thick but
thinner towards the inner corner so
definitely keep working on that eyeliner
until it's as straight as you want it or
as you can get it because let's be real
if you have any like bumps in your line
don't worry because that's where the
liquid liner is going to come in so with
the liquid liner it's clear that my
liner is not as sharp as it could be but
with this I'm just going to go right
over the top and it's going to just
smooth everything out make it really
crisp that's why I love this liner so
just go ahead and take that and clean up
any lines that you may have
and whatever's left over on the brush I
like to flick and make my liner taper
just slightly at the ends right here and
that I always do with the liquid because
it just gives me more control and it
just works better so definitely prefer
liquid to clean up detail of the
eyeliner
astly if you guys made any mistakes or
if you just want your wing to look
really sharp like a knife I always like
to I like to take a small concealer
brush and this one is by makeup geek it
is my favorite because it's so dense and
it's just the perfect little shape I
like to take a concealer or if you guys
don't like the highlighting effect you
can definitely use just your foundation
so that way it blends in better and I
like to take that and clean up the edges
of the liner and just really taper out
the tail of the liner with that
concealer as well that way everything
looks clean you don't have any eyeshadow
over here you can just clean everything
up all at once and your liner is gonna
look perfect
alright guys so that is the last step of
this liner tutorial I really hope that
this method helps you guys let me know
in the comments down below if it does
because that would just make me really
happy if it did I know everybody has
different methods my advice is just find
the most comfortable eyeliner method for
you and if that takes a lot of different
trial and error then then it does
because that happened to me I tried
every single eyeliner method and this is
just what works for me but I promise you
guys don't be discouraged once you
figure out your method and you practice
it it'll be so much easier and for the
most part your eyeliner will be blue
launches but sometimes it may not and
that's okay if you guys like this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you aren't already and I'll
see you guys in my next tutorial bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
