today's video is going to be a hair and
makeup tutorial I get so many requests
on this top knot and it's actually so
easy to do but there's like one little
trick that I do that will make it a lot
easier and just give it more shape so
I'm going to show you guys how to do
that on camera and then I'm also going
to do this makeup tutorial for you I
really hope that you guys like it I
tried to use a lot of new products for
you so I really hope that you guys enjoy
that as well and let's get started
alright so the first thing I'm going to
do is show you guys how I do my top knot
I've kind of showed it in another video
before but I'm gonna really show you
guys here because I still get so many
requests on how to do it first thing you
want to do is obviously pull all your
hair back and I have like a lot of baby
hairs so I need a lot of hairspray today
I'm just gonna use this Bumble and
Bumble a hairspray right now and spray
it all up in there especially where the
baby hairs are cool so take like a brush
like this I actually use a paddle brush
sometimes but I couldn't find it so
we're gonna use this one starts licking
everything back why are you laughing at
me Jeff so now I just want to starts
licking it back I like to kind of
slicked down my baby hairs too right
here you know give that little JLo baby
hair effect going on I like do layers of
hairspray cuz I just have a lot of baby
hair especially back here so then I just
kind of lift it up and then start really
coming through that as well
so after I have my hair up in a pony to
make my bun look a little bit bigger I'm
going to use a texture spray this is the
Oscar blondie pronto texture and volume
spray and just gonna kind of put that in
the pony just to give it a little bit
more fluff alright so here's the trick
so I grabbed it and I twist it once like
twisted all the way around once at the
base and then after you twist it once
then you're just going to wrap the hair
around like don't twist the rest of the
hair just take your pony and wrap it
around the twist you feel me so that way
it's like a wrap and it holds on to that
twisted base and then I just use my hair
tie and I am
but that's pretty much how I do it it
takes two seconds and it kind of always
works for me when I'm going to rush so
that's the topknot now let's get on to
the makeup all right so for today's
makeup look we're going to be using a
lot of glow eNOS a lot of bronzer so you
want to make sure that you wash your
face with an exfoliator today I used the
one by knux this one is going to make
sure to leave your face really soft and
like I said just get rid of all that
dead skin so I went ahead and did this
before filming this look is going to be
a lot of glow it's all about skin and so
it's really important to prime your face
I know a lot of people skip this I
always talk about how important primer
is and what primer is going to do is
just fill in any fine lines or pores and
it's going to make your makeup last a
lot longer it's also going to make it
apply a lot easier so in this month FC
glam bag I got the one from Smashbox
which is like amazing because Smashbox
is really known for their primers they
have great primers this is the photo
finish foundation primer and I'm going
to take a little bit of that and just
apply it all over my face
and I like to kind of Pat primers in I
feel like it Pat's them into any fine
lines and pores better than rubbing them
in and since I've been sick my under
eyes have been a bit dry and just
looking really tired so I'm going to
just apply these I'll check iPad's and
these are just really going to help with
tired under eyes these feel really nice
too they feel nice and cooled so if you
get puffy under eyes you could always
use pads like this to kind of brighten
up that area while you do your eyebrows
so as these are sitting I'm going to go
ahead and do my eyebrows the first thing
I'm going to do is apply my Anastacio
Beverly Hills clear brow gel because
it's the bomb and it's the best eyebrow
gel ever the stuff is like hairspray
extra hold for your eyebrows and I find
that by applying the brow gel first the
product clings to each hair making my
brow hairs look thicker ok for my brows
today I'm going to be using this brow
pencil by 8 Cosmetics this one is long
wearing so that's good especially if you
don't want your eyebrow to wipe off and
it's in the shade Universal taupe which
is going to work for a lot of different
eyebrow colors so I'm just going to
lightly start running that through the
brow and I'm going to start doing hair
like strokes so the way your hair grows
in that's the way you want to be drawing
in the eyebrows so here it's going to go
up
then they start to slant a little bit
more as we go towards the tail and then
on the other side there's a spoolie so I
like to kind of go through the brows
just to get rid of any excess product
and then as I get to the ends just
following these hairs and kind of
flicking the pencil outwards so after I
penciled them in I like to take the same
brow gel that I use the first time take
off most of the product and just lightly
apply this to the brows right after I
take off most of the product just
because I don't want it to take off any
pigment and sometimes if you have too
much product on your brow gel it will
mess with the pigment so I like to kind
of run these through the front and just
kind of shape the hairs since I am
growing out my eyebrow hairs I have a
few sparse hairs that are just annoying
so to cover them up I use concealer and
a small little concealer brush and I'm
just going to run that right under the
brow just so they look cleaner I'm just
using my finger just to kind of blend
that out so it's not so harsh of
concealer okay so my face at the moment
is a little bit paler than my neck and
shoulders because I always protect my
face from the Sun and I don't really
like to use self-tanner on my face
because it can make your skin a little
bit dry so in order to get that really
tan glow I'm going to use some of this
it's actually called a selfie tan and go
it's a face bronzer and it's going to
tan up my skin but it just washes off
right after so I'm going to go ahead and
take these off now and just apply some
of this so it's gonna just give like a
really tan glow to my skin you just want
to blend it in make sure it's really
well blended so you guys there's
actually like a situation right now
because I just got really tan and now my
body is really tan so I need a new
foundation because mine is a little bit
too light I'm gonna use it anyway and
just pretend that it's just as tan as my
face and I'm going to use the L'Oreal
infallible this is in 108 I'm just gonna
use this with a Beauty Blender and just
pop it on I recommend using this
foundation with a damp Beauty Blender I
feel like it's a totally different
experience than using it with a brush I
don't really like buffing this
foundation in just because I feel like
it's so matte that it will look crumbly
and dry so if you've tried it and you
didn't like
this foundation try using it with a damp
Beauty Blender I'm going to go ahead and
run the foundation over my lips because
I'm gonna go for a super nude lip today
alright foundation is on I love this
foundation I just love it so much it
makes me look floor list so we're gonna
be doing a super smoky eye today so I do
not want to do my concealer yet just in
case I need to wipe away any excess
foundation I want to look super clean
afterwards so I'm going to do the
concealer loss so the next thing we're
gonna do is just move back on to the
eyes because I really really want to
finish off the eyes before I do the
whole face and I'm gonna apply my usual
eyeshadow base it's the Mac soft ochre
you guys know I love this and it's best
to apply this with a synthetic brush I'm
using the glamour brush this is a flat
top kabuki and I'm just going to evenly
apply this over my lid it's kind of
gonna buff it out for me so after I
apply a cream base you guys know this is
like an every video I love to set it
with a powder use any bone colored
eyeshadow or anything close to your skin
tone I'm going to go ahead and use just
this free spirit color this is from the
Tarte lip palette and I'm going to run
that over the whole lid anywhere you
applied creams so it sets it and it's
nice and velvety alright zoomed you guys
in just a little bit so you guys could
see that eye shadow better this is the
Urban Decay eyeshadow it's called RIF
and it just looks like this it's a
really nice warm brown it has slight
shimmer in it I'm going to first take
this and apply it to my upper crease and
i'm using a sigma blending e25 brush for
this so I'm also taking it like in this
area here I want this to be kind of a
super dramatic smokey eye so this is the
first color we're just going to lay down
just going to kind of feather it out at
the end
okay so absolutely love this color for
the crease Urban Decay drip a rift now
I'm going to go back into my tartlet
palette I haven't used this in a while
and I'm going to go into dreamer and
multitasker they're just dark brown
shades you guys have any dark brown
shades at home feel free to use those
and this is the 231 brush by zoeva so
we're going to start focusing this on
the outer V of our eye
like to use a smaller brush for this
just because it's a smaller area of the
eye and I don't want to get too out of
hand over here you know just going in
with this and lightly building this
outer corner I'm gonna keep my other
blending brush like really close by just
in case I get any crazy i shadow
somewhere I don't want it I want to
blend it out all right so I know I said
I wanted to use a smaller brush but I
feel like this brush is actually a lot
easier to work with
it's the miniature Sigma blending brush
so I'm gonna start going in with that
puppy in the darker color and smoking
out the outer V here so I'm actually
gonna bring some of this dark brown also
into the crease because I'm going to
probably add a lot of black to this look
also so this dark brown is going to
serve as the gradient right in this area
here alright so now that we've smoked
our eyes out with the brown I'm going to
go in with black so any black eyeshadow
that you guys have is just fine I'm just
since I'm using this palette already
gonna use the black eyeshadow in the
palette which is called fashionista and
I'm gonna use a Mac two one three to
apply this I'm just gonna start packing
it on to the outer V as well and into
the crease of the eye
I'm like debating whether I want to add
darkness in the inner corner to you'll
see I like this Mac brush because I feel
like I can pack on color but then it's
fluffy enough to actually like blend the
color out as well so I don't have to
keep going back and forth between
brushes it's a nice brush to have and
then going back into my Sigma brush and
I'm just gonna blend through all of that
so with black eyeshadow it's a little
bit tedious because I want to keep
adding shadow and blending it out but
with black you want to just do a little
bit at a time so that's why I've been
just working on it for a second here and
I'm kind of thinking I want to try to
wing this out just a little bit okay so
I'm taking a little bit more of the
brown from the Tarte palette and I'm
just going to take that a little bit
further into this inner corner just to
deepen it up slightly alright so now we
have this really nice smoky halo around
our eyes I'm going to go ahead and pop a
color onto the lid so for the lid I'm
going to first apply a nice cream
eyeshadow this
is actually a shadow crayon it's from
trust eek and you can use this as just a
shadow by itself or you could even use
this as a base which is what I'm going
to do so I'm going to first take this
and apply it in all of this empty area
we have here sometimes when I use
shimmery colors I like to use a shimmery
base underneath just so it's like more
vibrant I'm also going to kind of put
that on my tear duct area so then after
that I'm going to go in with a beautiful
gold shade in this new cute to base
palette that I just got so I'm gonna
pick up this is actually called
two-faced love palette and I'm just
going to pick up this pretty gold shade
any gold shade that you guys have will
be just fine I'm going to use this
really small detail brush this is by
zoeva and it is the detailed shader
brush and you want to just blend it into
the black I'm gonna do the dark color in
the inner corner as well so I'm just
gonna go back into this brush and apply
some of the dark brown and block into
this inner corner I'm just gonna do it
right here I like to call this like the
sandwich method of eyeshadow when you
like sandwich a pretty color in the
center of two dark colors okay now I'm
just going to go back in and continue to
Pat the gold color onto the lid and if
you would like the gold to be even more
highlighted you can always spray some
fix+ on your brush or even water and Pat
it into the product and then also dab it
with a wet brush that will always make
metallic shadows even more foiled
looking so I'm gonna do my concealer now
before I do anything else this is a new
concealer to me this is by nude sticks
and it's in the shade medium five it has
like a pinky undertone this color so
it's perfect for like my inner corner
I'm going to use it with some morphe
brush to kind of buff it out because
it's a cream and I'm only applying this
color right in this inner part because
it does have like a nice peach undertone
to cancel out the darkness see that I
have here these concealers dry matte so
once they set you're good to go
alright I kind of just blended this to
the outer corner here then to highlight
the outer part of my eyes I'm just going
to use my Maybelline age rewind then I'm
going to use my Real Techniques
sculpting brush
okay and of course you want to set the
under highs so I'm gonna use my Laura
Mercier translucent powder I'm not gonna
bake or cook I'm just gonna dust it over
the under eye area my opinion this is
like the best under eye setting powder
oops you just spilled it and of course
this is my favorite under eye brush it's
the elf blush brush three dollars at
Target holla so once we do the under eye
then we can finish off the eyes so for
the under eyes I'm going to take a black
pencil this is by Too Faced and I'm
going to run this along the lower lash
line and really really smoke out the
lower lash line like really really like
raccoon really so I'm flying this in the
waterline and then also like on the lash
line I'm gonna take a pencil brush and
blend that out before it sets just
really smoke it out don't be afraid to
smoke out the lower lash line especially
when you're doing a smoky eye once you
apply lashes and stuff it doesn't look
as intense and this is just as a wave a
pencil brush okay so now that we have
the black I want to smoke it out even
more using the same color we used in the
crease which is the Rif color from urban
decay same Sigma blending brush I'm
going to run this right under the black
just so it's not just like black and
ashy you know want it to be a little bit
more warm I'm going to use the gold down
in the center as well the same goal will
be used on the lid popping it on a small
little angled brush so I have more
precision now I'm going to highlight the
inner corner of the eyes and I'm using
this nude stick in the shade shimmer I'm
just gonna pop that into the empty space
that we have right here and blend that
out with the other side has a little
sponge now I'm gonna do some mascara and
eyelashes using my roller lash mascara
by benefit for some reason I don't want
big heavy lashes for the look I want to
be able to really see the gold and all
that color so I'm gonna use the demi
wispies by heart Dell these are pretty
natural lashes actually but you guys
thought I was going to use House of
lashes iconic didn't you that you did
after I put these on and let them dry a
little bit I'm going to add a coat of
mascara and then put more mascara on my
lower lashes
alright so of course you guys know I'm
going to bronze up my face using Mac's
give me Sun because it is my holy grail
I'm using
my Mac one six eight brush you also want
to do the jawline - I also want to glow
even more so I'm gonna use my mac
mineralize skinfinish this is in gold
deposit and this is like a super gold
let me open up you guys this is super
gold oh yeah
so I'm just gonna apply some of that
just sweep it across the cheeks and
right on top of the eyebrow not on top
of the eyebrow but above the eyebrow
alright so of course I'm going to go
into my contour this is my own associate
contour kit I'm going into the darkest
shade I believe it's Havanna and I mix
it with this one and then I'm just going
to contour way so we also want to
contour the nose to contour the nose I
like to use my Mac Studio Fix this is a
powder foundation and it's n NC 43 I
just feel like it looks a little bit
softer around the nose area so I use
this to contour my nose and then I just
take the same brush I just kind of dust
it off on my hand and take the banana
powder from the Anastacio contour kit
and I like to add that down at the
bridge of the nose just so it makes it
look a little bit more lifted and
straight so now I'm going to apply a
cream highlight this is by G way and I'm
just going to use my fingers to Pat this
on the high points of my cheekbones and
then over top of that I'm going in with
the new highlighters this one is called
so Hollywood it's by Anastasia Beverly
Hills they will be available in August I
can't wait for you guys to be able to
get these so I'm just going to heavily
apply that right on top under the brow
bone as well and then like even in the
inner corner I'm going to apply to my
nose just the tip and I'm really gonna
go on the Cupid's bow here so now that
my mascara has dried I can actually curl
my lashes just to kind of make them sit
up a little bit more so you could see
them better now we're gonna apply some
blush I'm using peaches by Mac this is
one of my favorites especially when I do
a super bronzy look because I love to
look really peachy so this is the mac
fix+ spray and this isn't like a
long-lasting setting spray it just makes
the makeup just set like the powders so
that it looks more dewy and not as
powdery now it's time for the lips I'm
gonna take first oak lip liner by Mac
and then right over top of that I'm
going to use this new lipstick that I
just got by Mac it's called transformed
I love the way this looks like I really
wanted to go for a super like lips
almost blending into my skin type of
nude but if you guys don't really care
for it to be that nude you could use the
lip gloss on top this is also by nude
Stix and it is in the shade buff I
thought that that was going to add some
more color but I think the nude is just
really really nude alright so I'm gonna
go with anastacio a undressed lip gloss
on top and let's see if that adds a
little bit more pink to this there we go
just add it a little bit more pink so
that's it for the tutorial I really hope
that you guys enjoyed the video and that
you know the little top knot trick works
for you guys let me know if it does
snapchat me you guys don't follow me on
snapchat like are we even friends you
know what I mean follow me on snapchat I
will leave it in my description box it's
just does e Perkins one word and that's
about everything so I'll see you guys in
