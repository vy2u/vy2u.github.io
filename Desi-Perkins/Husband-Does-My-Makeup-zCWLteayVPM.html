through doing your makeup okay can you
not pull down cuz you're gonna give me
wrinkles to pull up oh yeah soon we're
gonna go ahead and apply some eyeshadow
and it looks like she's used this one
quite a bit go ahead and start there I
can feel like you're doing a fabulous
job
I feel like I have a lot of powder on my
face
it's got a set don't worry the fact that
you know they have two sets Gracie
looking at black hole why do you put so
much on it all right

out but it looks good
you've never watched me contour my nose
off no you're going the wrong I can just
feel this is strong they won't give in
how do I make this not as strong but
it's your contour game just too strong
too strong reigneth funny cuz I can
actually see like your face looking at
it like through an artistic point of
view I'm kinda like like you're really
trying to get it together sound looks
guy
Wow I've always talked desi this is one
of my favorite parts of her makeup and
it's the the little highlight highlight
right in the eye
oh god I feel like you're putting it on
my nose but whatever you know that's it
you're just gonna put it on my eyes what
else you put it everywhere when people
say like that highlight game is too
strong where's the highlight it's an
interesting a brush choice but every
artist is different
mm-hmm just put that right on top my
contour Oh
it's just complementing the contour I
always see it make like some really cool
designs up here so I'm just gonna give
you a nice little arrow I usually use
concealer but okay
oh we will just use that just blend all
over but how am I supposed to over line
your lips with this can't you don't have
to over line my lips perfect I didn't
want to anyways wow this is Bink
