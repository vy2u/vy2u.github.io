so today's video is going to be another
Halloween look and I want to do
something pretty and girly and once
again I'm melting again I just had this
idea about melting when I first started
brainstorming makeup tutorials and this
was what I thought of and then I kind of
just incorporated it into the skull
funny thing is that I got my info from
like a horror pic and I'll put a picture
here and I also had an image saved from
another photo shoot that I found online
and I'll also put that here and I kind
of just combined the two ideas together
and that's like where this came from but
I thought I'd make it nice and sparkly
and girly and I've seen other people
create ice cream melting looks like
madeyewlook did one I loved her if you
guys don't know who she is you need to
check her out because her
special-effects makeup and her painting
is just like amazing and Thomas Hulbert
recently did one that was like
phenomenal it was so amazing I couldn't
stop staring at it like perfect
beautiful face you guys need to check
both of them out and honestly truly can
we talk about this wig this wig is
everything I'm probably just going to
start wearing it on a normal everyday
basis I just quickly wanted to say a
huge thank you to Pravana for hooking it
up I sent them a picture of like this
beautiful pink wig that reminded me of
strawberry ice cream and they got the
hair from extensions plus and they
custom colored it for me to get that
perfect strawberry color that I was
looking for and I loved it so much well
I will link all of their stuff down
below and yeah I think that's everything
let's go ahead and start melting all
right so we're going to start off with
our Mac soft ochre Paint Pot per usual
and I'm just going to buff this all over
my lids for a nice opaque base and then
of course the step is a must and every
look for the most part I'm applying
Mac's Blanc type all over the brow bone
lid and crease just to kind of set
everything and that's going to be my
base color now I'm going with this NYX
eye shadow in the shade thang murder and
I'm going to buff that into my crease
and create a really nice high cut crease
type look this look is pretty similar to
the skull look I like to keep the eye
looks classic when I do crazy face
makeup so it doesn't distract too much
so just keep that in mind it's kind of
similar you want to then take your
Inglot gel liner and create a really
fierce a swing yes and I'm using a
Michaels paintbrush that has changed my
life with my eyeliner game it's just so
good I went into the peach palette by
toothpaste and I got this warm brown but
it looked a little too orange
too orange scratch that
rewind so instead I'm going to use this
nice medium matte brown shade from the
lorac palette it's the shade corduroy
you can use pretty much any medium matte
brown shadow that you have in your
makeup collection and you're just going
to connect the end of the wing to about
mid crease and blend it out time for
foundation I'm using my benefit hello
flawless and I'm just going to apply
that with my Beauty Blender so take your
foundation and I mean really you could
take it all the way up but I kind of
just did this halfway thing because I
knew that I was going to face paint the
rest so I did I wanted to add sparkle to
the eyes so I'm taking my Midnight
Cowboy glitter liner from Urban Decay
and I'm applying that right on top of my
gel liner is just like a nice thin line
right above it and I actually Pat it on
some jcat champagne kiss glitter on top
of that to make it a little bit more
pink this way all the pink tones tie
nicely together now I'm going to go
ahead and apply some lashes these are
Koko lashes and the style goddess
they're very similar to a conics I'm
taking my makeup forever flash palette
and I'm mixing the red and white to
create a nice strawberry pink shade I'm
just going to take a paint brush and
start outlining the drips this is also
very similar to the last video you just
want to kind of randomly start outlining
you know drips on your face and I had
that image that I showed you guys in my
intro as my reference you know if you
don't like something erase it move on
just got an email interrupting my video
I decided to add a little bit of water
just to actually get a real drip and
that helped as well so if you're having
trouble creating drips you could just
put extra water on your brush and dab it
on your face and the real drip will
happen
so I'm just going to continue to do that
along the face and I'm buffing it out on
the edges just so that when I decide to
put more face paint at all blends nicely
and there's not like a harsh line
quickly doing the other side I literally
did that slide in one run I think it's
easier if you just go for it really
quickly and it just looks a lot more
organic that way I had no problems with
the other side it was so easy alright
I'm going to take that mixture that I
made and I'm just going to start
applying that all over my face
make sure you apply a little bit only
like the thing with these make up
forever cream colors is that if you
apply too much it gets really greasy and
oily so apply the sheerest layer and
buff it out I I started to buff it out
so that it was just just a very very
very sheer layer and then you could set
it with a translucent powder if you want
to and then use the eyeshadow to add
more dimension so I'm using the same NYX
eyeshadow that I used in my crease and
I'm going to start adding a little
dimension to the drips so that they look
3d instead of just flat on the face and
anywhere you add a shadow we're going to
also go in with white and add a
highlight that way it really looks
three-dimensional while I'm here I
decided to blow out my lower lash line I
don't know why I said blow out smoke out
smoke out my lower lash line with the
NYX eye shadow as well as you guys can
see I'm alternating between two brushes
a smaller brush for details and then
this fluffier one to kind of buff any
harsh edges out and now I'm just going
to go back into the makeup forever flash
palette and you want to take any white
paint that you have or even a white
eyeliner and start adding a highlight on
the opposite side that you added a
shadow or you know you could also add it
just like at the bottom of the drops
that helps as well as you would apply
bronzer apply the pink eyeshadow around
your forehead so this is where
everything really pops taking a dark
matte Brown
I shadow or a medium tone and applying
it on all the curves of the drips so
anywhere there's a curve you should add
a shadow and that's what's going to make
it look like it's popping off your face
mm-hmm I'm also taking that brown
eyeshadow and smoking out the outer part
of my lower lash line and to open up the
eyes take a white liner pencil and line
the inner rim add some bottom mascara
and now it's time for the perfect
highlight this is the Pat McGrath it's
the pink iridescent highlight and this
is perfect for this look I'm applying it
to the tip of the nose and the Cupid's
bow for now taking the tardis lip pencil
in boho I'm going to line my lips with
this I originally was going to use
another color but once I saw how it
looked on the lips I was like this is
the perfect pink for this look so I'm
just using this pencil to line and fill
in the entirety of my names once I
finish the lips I realized I needed more
of that highlighter all over my body so
I put it on my collarbones and my
shoulders I also put it in the inner
corners of my eyes as a inner corner
highlight it was perfect
