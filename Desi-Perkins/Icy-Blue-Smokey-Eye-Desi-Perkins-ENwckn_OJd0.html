today's video I wanted to do something a
little bit more dramatic because I've
been wearing natural makeup like every
single day for the last month this is
more of a very icy type of blue eye
shadow look so I feel like it's a little
bit more wearable I mixed some blues and
some Silver's to kind of tone down like
blue eye shadow so I really hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial and if you're
interested in the look then keep on
watching alright so for this look I want
more of a matte skin complexion it's
good to use a mattifying lotion this one
is by dr. Brandt it's called pores and
no more I like to focus things like this
mostly like in the t-zone where I get 20
I'm going to use this new foundation
it's not new but lustre luxe gave it to
me because it was too tan for her
winnings this is the l'oreal infallible
Pro matte foundation I'm gonna try the
color fresh beige and I'm using a real
techniques sculpting brush for this dang
that actually matches perfectly so now
that we have our foundation done I'm
just gonna go ahead and move on to the
eyes and we'll finish the face after
just in case we need to clean anything
up I'm gonna use this Milani brow
shaping gel for the brows this isn't
clear and I'm just gonna groom eyebrows
upwards cuz that's kind of how I like
them to go mostly upwards in the front
and then I kind of just pull them back
towards this area here see how adding
brow gel like it defines them a little
bit more if you look at this side it's
just kind of messy this eyebrow is my
bad eyebrow that's why I'm always facing
this way
mystery solved I'm going to use the
anastacio brow pencil in soft Brown
today by default because I can't find my
caramel color lately I've been liking to
give myself more of a soft brow a more
fluffy brow alright so I assumed you
guys in just a little bit more so you
could see better
to prime my lids I'm gonna use my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot I'm just taking a
fluffy brush and lightly applying this
all over just so that our eyeshadow is
more vibrant you guys know the drill for
the eyes I'm going to start off with
this new Too Faced palette this is their
natural and matte palette it's a really
nice little palette with are some cool
tones and warm tones in here but I'm
gonna just set my base with this shade
here it's called heaven and I'm gonna
highlight my brow bone with this also
when I go into this really nice cool
toned topi shade here with my morphe I'm
4 for 1 I'm just gonna run that through
the crease and I want this look to be
super smoky so I'm just really kind of
mostly concentrating it into the socket
and then feathering whatever product is
left upwards so it just kind of diffuses
out next I'm going to go into this dark
brown shade here it's called expresso
and I'm just using the same brush and
I'm going to deepen that crease up just
a bit
Oh for the eyes I'm gonna apply a base
just to intensify the color I'm going to
use this one by Mary Kay it's called
tell me more and you can actually build
the intensity up with this color so you
can make it as light or as dark as you
want but I'm going for more of an icy
look so I'm just gonna apply a thin
layer of this I'm also applying it
around the tear duct all right so now
I'm gonna take a concealer brush this
one is by Crown and I'm gonna dip it in
to the color pop shadow in the shade
Liberty because I'm gonna put silver
over this I want it to be kind of icy
it's the perfect color but since we have
the blue underneath it kind of gave just
a nice blue hue to it next I'm gonna go
into this shade here this is from a
morphe palette and I'm gonna use that to
highlight the inner corners of my eyes
so I decided to darken up the look of it
I'm gonna go into my Tarte lip palette
by Tarte and take this black eyeshadow
I'm using the same morphe brush and I'm
just gonna use this in the crease to
deepen it up blending it also in this
outer V area here I think I'm gonna put
it right in this little pocket that we
left free of shadow right here so I'm
focusing most of the color on these
areas but I'm still gonna bring it
through all the way with whatever's left
over just so it connects in this center
area here so before we finish off the
eyes I'm just gonna do my under eye
concealer this is the naked skin
weightless complete coverage concealer
and I've been loving it because it does
not crease when I say it doesn't crease
I mean it doesn't crease that much
because let's face it if you have
under-eye fine lines there's really
nothing that's gonna stop that from
creasing but this one definitely doesn't
look crazy it's really nice so I'm just
gonna pop that under the eyes and then
also around my nose and in these laugh
lines and I'm just gonna use the same
Real Techniques brush that we used for
our foundation
to set the under-eye concealer I'm going
to use my Kat Von D shade light palette
and this is the elf blush brush now for
the waterline I'm going to take this
liner this is by the balm it's called
mr. right now I'm also gonna drag the
Liberty by color pop along the lash line
as well just in the inner part of the
eye as I get to the outer corner I'm
just kind of fading it outward so now
I'm gonna go back into this charcoal
black color here on a flat brush and I'm
just gonna kind of define the outer
parts of our eyes because right now it's
looking a little bit too blue you know
what I mean I decided to take this pixie
mesmerising mineral duo and this is in
the shade apricot glow and I'm gonna
just take this color very very light
amount and buff the edges of the eye
shadow just a bit it's not gonna look
super warm but I just want to kind of
buff it out a little bit and neutralize
this area here this eye shadow is super
easy to apply and blend out so it's
gonna be perfect to blend out your
crease area I'm going in with some
mascara and I'm using the roller lash by
benefit this mascara is the bomb calm so
now I'm gonna apply some false eyelashes
and of course I'm using ikonics by house
of lashes so now that my eyes are
completely done I'm just gonna finish
off the face I'm going to use my
chocolate bronzer this is the dark
chocolate Soleil by Too Faced smells
like chocolate so then it makes my face
smell like chocolate and we like that
I'm gonna use the same elf blush brush
this brush is nifty $3 and it's amazing
alright so for cheeks I want a really
babydoll pink so I'm gonna go into my
Tarte palette here and just pick up this
really really light pink shade it's
actually kind of a hot pink shade same
brush and I'm just gonna pop that onto
the apples of my cheeks right on top of
that I want to add just a tiny bit of
glow nothing too much because I do want
this to look mostly matte I'm gonna use
a face illuminating highlight and this
is by vintage it's this one right here
I'm just taking my Mac Studio Fix in NC
43 this is a powder foundation I'm just
gonna lightly contour my nose because it
makes so lastly is lips and I have this
NYX lip butter and this is in the shade
pops it's kind of a ma B shade and I'm
not using lip liner because I don't want
to draw too much attention to the lips
just ooh that's a little bright actually
alright so I love this color but it kind
of looks a little bit more Barbie like
and I want it to look a little bit more
cool so I'm gonna switch out the color
of the lip actually gonna take this
Milani lipstick in the shade matte
innocence super pale but that is super
nude if you guys aren't into that you do
have the other lip option but I like the
really really pale lips with these with
these I like the really really pale lip
with these eyes just cuz I feel like it
all kind of goes together alright guys
