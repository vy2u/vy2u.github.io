today's video order video make a
tutorial on this look right here which
using the news Jaclyn hill and morphe
palette i just got around to playing
with this the other day and you guys
loved the makeup look and wanted this
tutorial so here we are what this
tutorial
i actually was inspired to use these
tones in particular from the palette
because I watched Jamie meet Jamie hi
guy I love her I'll link her in the
description box she has the most
incredible Scottish accent that just she
could say anything and I'm like yes I
hope you guys like it let's go ahead and
get started first before I start I think
I'm going to conceal my results they're
healing though so that's good they're
just a little bit red still if you guys
haven't checked out my last video make
sure you go check it out because you
guys how to cover it I'm so happy that
they're you know healing they're just
red they're mostly kind of flat so I'm
going to take my Becca concealer and
just put a little bit on to start
blending it in with my morphe brush just
so it doesn't distract me personally so
first I'm taking a base this is the Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and to take the
Sigma precision flat angled brush and I
actually dipped one drop of duraline in
here because it makes it nicer to work
with not as drying if your lizard dryer
I love this eyeshadow base what I'm
doing really intense looks just evened
out all the redness on my eyes but I'm
going to put a very light layer of it
I'm so happy you guys liked my last
video it really meant a lot to me how
supportive you guys all were thank you
very much
so the only thing that the palette
doesn't really have in the matte light
shade to set your base so I'm just
picking up a matte bone color shadow
it's going to make it easier for us to
blend all these colors we're actually
going to take an even lighter color and
just put it on the brow bone up here to
take like a white eyeshadow or something
just to give a little highlight up in
this area we're going to go into the
Jaclyn hill palette boom so I'm taking
it back to 2 4 and I'm going to start
with this orange shade over here like a
very nice tangerine color and I'm going
to start applying this in the upper
crease as
a transition shade dipping back into
that tangerine color I'm just lightly
swishing that into the upper crease of
the eye and then whatever's left over on
the brush I bring it out back here just
so there's a nice fade on the outer part
of the eye next I'm taking a mixture of
this color right here and also this
shade right over here both matte shades
and I'm still using my back two to four
for that and I'm going to place that
right under where I place that tangerine
color same very light motions here you
blend up too far with this color that
we're applying now it's going to cover
everything we did with that tangerine
shade and you're not going to have as
good as a gradient so make sure you try
to stay right underneath it gives you
that sunset look sometimes I will cover
my transition shade on accident because
I blend up too far I just go back in
with a cool brush and the transition
shade again and I'll buff out the edges
just so it peeps through one more time
kind of bringing it into the outer
corner here circular motions so I
stopped using the math teach you for for
a while but the other day I was like oh
man you know I'm going to pick that back
up again because I used to use it all
the time and I forgot how much I loved
this brush it's a little bit larger than
like a Mac 216 or one of my Smith's
brushes but it doesn't help you blend
because it's so soft and fluffy
you just have to make sure that you stay
in the right area but it bust out edges
like really really nicely perfect for
transition colors so if I want to go
back into the transition shade I can and
really blend out those edges too just to
make sure that we don't lose any of the
tangerine color I'm going to take a
smaller brush this is the Smith's 2 3 5
brush this one has a really nice fine
point so it's going to get really into
the crease which is what we want I'm
going to be taking this shade right over
here it's a nice deep maroon shade and
I'm using the Smith 235 for that this
brush has like such a nice fine point it
also has a fluffy outer part of the
point so it's going to get into the
crease and also blend it for you look
down into my mirror so I could really
get into that crease really buffing it
in and I start with a very very small
amount of product because when you work
with darker call
you can mess up a lot easier so if you
start with a little bit of product first
it's going to be better for you if you
do mess up this colors super pigmented
too so I barely put any on it's already
pretty intense that's it that's all I'm
not going to dip back in because we're
going to use one last shade so I have my
Mac's three to four brush always next to
me so that if I need to I can buff out
any edges afterwards it's really good at
diffusing colors so I just use that to
lightly go over all these eyeshadows
that I put down it's going to give it a
nice soft look I know this is a lot of
colors but then I went into this really
really deep expresso
Brown here and this is where we're going
to deepen everything and really just
fine it the lowest part of the crease
and where you want to place this so if
you notice every time I dip into new
eyeshadow product I put it where I want
the product to be most pigmented which
is right into the crease and then
whatever is left over I always lightly
feather it out so that everything starts
to like blend into the rest of the face
if you will going to take a clean
blending brush with no product on it and
smooth out the edges of everything one
last time taking this foiled copper
eyeshadow on a flat concealer brush and
I lightly dampened it with some fix+
doesn't need it but I just feel like it
makes it a little bit sharper so I can
cut the crease a little better I'm just
going to round out the shape here on the
crease I went in with a very light
amount first so I could get a good
guideline but now we've got to build it
up Gary's fiery I love Capri I looks and
I feel like it looks so good on so many
different eye colors if you have hazel
eyes or green eyes or like really even
light brown eyes it just makes them pop
so much it makes your eyes look lighter
oops
I'm going to pick up my smith to 5/6
brush and I'm going to take this shade
right here that we used in the crease so
we're going to take that and place it
right here and feather it so it has a
little bit of depth in that outer corner
also don't worry if you mess up over
here because we can clean it up with see
later I'm going to take the deeper
maroon shade and apply that at the very
very edge of the outer V here we are
making moves
I love these eye shadows oh my god I
just saw JLo on her Instagram life
wearing the Heike phase and I about died
I know she's been I mean all this silver
she's red silver but she was wearing
faith the other day and I about died I
mean she is like iconic okay I love her
she's worn almost all the colors I've
seen her wear gold black and phase and
the silvers let's apply our lashes since
we're here I'm using the voluminous last
paradise waterproof mascara and this is
by L'Oreal this one right here really
good actually
for me I have such little lashes so it's
one of those mascaras that really sticks
to each individual lash but doesn't
clump up like it it adds the thickness
around every lash without making it look
super clumpy my kind of formula also
update I ran out of the piece and I have
yet to go buy another bottle so I
haven't been using it for like the last
three weeks I need to go get more
because my lashes are starting so let's
go back to cool you could apply a black
wing if you want with this look but I
did not but if you guys want to do a
wing then to a winning alright so I'm
going to be using the Meraki lash glue
oh I'm using clean B lashes so what I do
is I put like a thin layer on each lash
I go back to the first lash and put
another thin layer to make it extra
sticky let them sit and dry for a second
alright so I'm going to go ahead and
apply the lashes now coming up from
above
if mm-hmm typically I would then move on
to doing the rest of my face makeup like
my foundation and everything and then
finish the eye but I'm filming by myself
right now so I'm just going to finish
the eyes first and then zoom out and do
the rest of my face so I got to put a
little concealer on so that I could
blend the eyeshadow out on my lower lash
line this is my Becca I just love this
concealer this is literally like my
favorite I've been using all the time
now luminous concealer medium this is
the morphe g37 very similar so the other
one I use I'm just going to blend that
in
really quick so moving on to the lower
lash line I'm going to be using the Marc
Jacobs Koko eyeliner pencil apply that
into the waterline and also on the lower
lash line slightly do it messy because
we're going to blend it out with shadow
for the lower lash line I'm going to
first start out with this shade over
here and apply that with a Smith to 5/3
brush always start at the outer part of
the eye first with the most product and
then work it inwards to the inner corner
and actually I'm going to use a fluffier
clean blending brush to diffuse that can
look crazy really fast I'm gonna keep
using this brush this is the Smith 230
and I'm going to go into the tangerine
shade and also buff that under the eye
mostly on the outer part and connect it
to the top on a pencil brush I'm going
to use that on the very very outer
corner that way everything that's
deepened up on the outer corner here
will also be deepened up on the outer
corner of your under eye if you need to
take your blending brush go back in and
just use it a little bit can do that and
then you can go ahead and apply mascara
to your lower lashes which I'm gonna do
off camera because mine are very
difficult to do and I'll just be
covering it the whole time they're very
tiny so I'll be right back so now I'm
moving on to the face makeup I'm doing a
pretty similar routine as my last video
that I uploaded I'm using my I giorgio
armani luminous silk i'm going to try
the color eight today just to try to
match my my neck a little bit better
taking that on a little dish and I'm
going to mix it with my Mac strobe cream
dilute the foundation make it even more
luminous and just give it that really
healthy look finish oh I think that's
going to be really good for me now take
my piggy blender I'm going to blend all
of that in okay so now we have a nice
sheer layer of foundation I'm going to
take my brush and this is the morphe g40
and I'm going to go lightly over my
problem areas just one more time with
patting motions
pretty good so since my breakouts are in
the healing process and they're a little
bit more flat I'm not going to do the
Studio Fix trick that I showed you guys
in my last video because there's no pump
you can't apply a light layer to just
kind of conceal them a little bit more
though if you want to the
stuff is just heavy-duty it's really
going to conceal further and in the last
video I put a little bit more concealer
over top and I'm just going to leave
them like that I'm gonna fly a little
powder to my oilier areas this is the
charlotte tilbury airbrush flawless
finish powder some asides of my house
and on my forehead in the center and on
the chin I'm taking a fluffier brush and
swirling into that powder and just
patting it over the breakouts - I'm
going to pick up the map 1/16 brush and
going into the studio fix this is NC 43
and I'm going to apply it where I would
apply my contour and just lightly tap
into it to get a little more coverage in
that area and then I'm going to take a
lighter color this is NC 40 for the
center of my forehead here so that it's
a little lighter and it's going to cover
the breakouts there so I did forget to
apply my liquid glow before I put all my
powders on my face but it's ok because I
didn't put too much powder here and I'm
not really that much here either so it's
fine not a big deal but if you're doing
this at home make sure you apply your
liquid first than your powders and I'm
using my mixture here this is the Marc
Jacobs do you drop's with the iconic
London original shade drop by the way
this is just like a candle holder from
Michael's craft store that I picked up
it's just nice to use it to blend
mixtures of foundations I think I'm a
mad scientist sometimes I'm like
blending five different foundations just
to see what happens so here comes the
glow right down the center of the nose
the reason I mixed these two highlights
is because the iconic London one is very
very powerful and sometimes it can be
too powerful for the more of like the
wet look that I'm going for like it
could look dark I need it to be a little
bit lighter and then the Marc Jacobs one
dilutes it a little bit but I still get
the intensity it's just not as crazy and
blend it out someone told me that they
don't like to do the chin highlight
because it looks like chicken grease
after they'd be in KFC and I totally
agree but I still fuss with it look at
that
boom now I'm going to go ahead and do
that to the cheekbones as well I like to
do the highlights first because now
because I did that darker powder
is like kind of going into it sometimes
it can turn ashy or it can like send us
a liquid product it doesn't blend as
seamlessly as it would I was just
blending it on top of a liquid so it's
really important to do all your creams
and liquids first and then your powders
but I got so into it that I forgot also
putting that on the forehead
all right liquid glow done I'm going to
set the glow with some more glue I'm
going to be using the Dior nude air
luminous and oo one with the Sephora fan
brush just has a little bit of like a
rose gold undertone I think it might
look really nice with the this makeup
look and just going to lightly dust that
over all that liquid glow a little too
much I think I think I'm going a little
too much which some would say is
impossible but it's going to go back
over with my foundation brush so
finishing off I'm going to apply a
little bronzer this is the terracotta
shade oh five this is a girl a girl a
girl on one day I'll be able to say it I
always forget and my Mac 147 brush this
brush is so good for applying bronzer
when you have breakouts because it's so
soft it like disperses the product
without like moving anything around too
much under the skin so it's just a very
soft brush and I'm gonna in circular
motions apply it to the hairline first
over here and then bring it down the
hollows also along the perimeter of the
forehead
I don't need to apply too much because
we applied a little bit of a darker
shade of our Mac Studio Fix there's
already a little depth there just kind
of going over it lightly okay so I
decided to go with matte copper tone
blush to stick with the coppery shades
of this whole Olaf so it's all in
synergy and lightly Pat it onto the
cheeks so the blush is done now the
final step is the lipstick combo that I
used the new dose of color lip it up
sticks these are so good the formula is
like really creamy really pigmented
hydrating and I mix two colors yesterday
I use brulee and toast I'm going to go
on with toast
I like the shape of these because it's
easy to put them all inside a lip liner
so toes just pretty just like by itself
it's like a really nice nudey tone but I
want it to make it a little bit more
pink so that's why I slide through lay
over top put the perfect color with this
eye look I'm going to set everything
with a little spray little six o'clock
my mess I'm actually just doing a lot
and that's there this is the finished
makeup look I love this makeup look I
love the tones and if you guys liked it
don't forget to tweet me photos if you
do recreate it and savory ones most on
them bye
hmm I think should I go into that color
oh I hate when I do makeup look when I
forget what I did then wedding why did
the trashman always come at this I swear
doesn't matter when on filming trash
mess here I hope I don't stare too
