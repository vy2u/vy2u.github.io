to my channel so I decided to start
filming monthly favorites for you guys
just because I first of all I love
watching other people's monthly
favorites I am a product hoarder
anytime somebody tells me something's
amazing I'm like okay I'm gonna go try
that product just because I love trying
new things and along the way I
discovered new things myself so I'd love
to share with you guys I tried to
mention things in videos while I'm doing
tutorial but it just gets really long
and so I'm dedicating one video a month
to talking you guys about products that
I discovered and loved that month so
with all of that said let's get started
with the favorites of July so the first
thing I want to talk to you about is my
nail polish I've been getting so many
questions from you guys on my tutorials
what color I'm wearing and I recently
got a manicure a while back and you know
how they try to talk you into getting
gel like they always get you into
getting gel like no matter what I
brought my nail polish and they were
like no honey I get you Jo you know I'm
saying like they want you to get Jo
so I got suckered into it and they
picked me a color that was really
similar to the color it was almost the
same but I don't know it's just
something about it wasn't exact so I
went back today and got my Holy Grail
nude color and this is SCS
spin-the-bottle a lot of you guys have
been asking about it this is my favorite
nude nail polish of all times I feel
like I sound super nasally because I
have the worst allergies or you know it
thank you yes the next product I wanted
to talk to you guys about is a skincare
item and I'm gonna be doing a skincare
routine video soon I know I've been
promising you guys not forever I'm gonna
do it so but anyways this is a new item
to my skincare it's not something that's
been continuous its new and I just
picked it up this July so it is the
Murad skin smoothing polish and this
it deeply exfoliates to leave skin soft
and smooth helps relieve congested pores
and on the back it has micro polishing
beats that deeply exfoliate to help
relieve clogged pores and blackheads
which I have an issue with witch hazel
and cinnamon extract visibly tighten
pores and balance oil production which I
also have a problem with in this area I
get super oily and it has a star flower
extract which leaves the skin soft and
supple so this is something that you do
two to three times a week I've kind of
been doing it a little bit more than
that and now you're not supposed to but
I just love the way it makes my skin
feel and it's just the perfect
consistency it's not super abrasive for
those of you guys have who have maybe
sensitive skin too harsh exfoliant so I
absolutely love this product and I'm
gonna keep you guys posted but so far I
love it the next product I want to talk
to you guys about is a foundation that
I've been wearing basically every single
day for the month of July and I think I
started wearing it even before that it
is the benefit hello flawless foundation
and I cannot say enough good things
about this the consistency is just so
creamy and the finish is flawless and
dewy the coverage is medium to full and
I feel like it covers everything I just
I love this foundation so much it gives
you like just beautiful baby softer
glowy skin I really like it I don't know
if I'd recommend it if you have really
oily skin because it does have a dewy
finish I am in the shade
it says warm me up toasted beige and
before this I was beige but I think I
got a little bit tanner so I moved up a
color but yeah it's oil free and as SPF
25 so it's perfect for everyday wear
basically use two drops and that covers
my entire face like two drops three
drops is too much
so yeah I think this bottle will last a
long time 1.0 fluid ounces so that's
pretty standard for a foundation but
yeah I absolutely love it I recommend it
and this foundation is definitely going
to be repurchased several times by me so
the next product I'm going to talk to
you
is a hair product I've put so much
bleach in my hair that I will use
anything to prevent further damage or
just to make it feel softer or shinier
and healthier and I have to blow-dry my
hair because as you guys know I've said
it in another video I will have the
frizzy of hair if I don't and I do have
a video showing how I blow-dry my hair
I'll link it down below for you guys but
I recently picked up this sexy hair blow
out spray my friend has a similar one by
Kendra and it's so expensive I just
couldn't bring myself to purchase it and
this one is way cheaper and it's
basically a spray that you put in your
hair after you get out of the shower and
it protects it from the heat it says
that let me just read it cuz I can't
speak heat defense blowout spray that
word is way too hard for me to say oh
because it's not English basically it
says you spray it on damp hair blow-dry
with your favorite brush for a smooth
shiny if frizz free hair and this says
that it actually speeds up your blow-dry
process so that it takes less time which
is amazing because I was spending way
too much time round brush blow drying my
hair and now I can blow-dry my hair in
like 10 to 15 minutes which for me is
really short amount of time because
before it was like 30 to 40 minutes but
anyways yeah I love this it smells like
vacation it smells like a pina colada
and I honestly it's not exactly like the
Kendra spray so I'm kind of suspicious
like I feel like it's the same thing
only the Kendra one is way more
expensive I love this I recommend it for
anyone who blow-dries their hair
especially with the round brush and it's
also just good to protect your hair from
heat so this is definitely a keeper for
more than just this month next we have
some brushes that were sent to me by a
company that I wasn't really aware of
but I kind of saw these brushes floating
around YouTube and just recently though
I didn't really ever know about these
brushes before and I'm so happy that I
got to try them out because they
are amazing and they are these zoeva
brushes I probably could have cleaned
them for you guys but as you can see
they're very well loved and they're very
dirty I'm sorry I ease these every day
and oh they're so good I love them so
much I can't say enough about them I
haven't had any shedding the application
is so beautiful the eyeliner brush
genius like this wing today like I'm
just gonna say it it's pretty good
because of this brush I love it and just
oh this brush - it's the is it the luxe
it's a smoky shader brush the 2 3 4
smoky shader brush and it's so perfect
for the under eye smoking out the under
eye and I love doing that pretty much do
it every day so this brush it's amazing
I also kind of use this to date define
the crease a little bit this one is
amazing for highlighter it's just the
perfect size to pop on any highlight and
it's the highlight brush the 105
highlight I'm pretty sure they sent me
more than these but these are the ones
that I had on hand right now so I'm just
kind of showing you them really quickly
this one is the face definer 101 brush
love this for an all-over warm
application to the face just to give you
that sunkissed look this one is a really
nice blending brush it's the 2 to 7 and
then this brush which is also amazing is
the two three one and if you guys are
looking into these brushes for any
reason if you want to check them out the
ones that I have I would definitely
recommend for sure the highlight brush
this 231 petit crease brush and the 315
eyeliner brush basically all the brushes
but the two three four like these are
the ones that I'm just obsessed with
this one is nice too but these are like
oh I love them so if you guys are
interested I'll put all the links for
everything down below but anyways I just
love them beautiful you guys should try
them the price point I believe
is a little bit it's less than Mack but
a little bit more than Sigma so if you
guys are interested check out the link
down below so the next product I'm going
to talk to you guys about are Crest
Whitestrips and recently I found out
that they made some for people who have
sensitive teeth and a lot of whitening
products say that they're for sensitive
teeth but I kind of find that they're
not and your teeth actually end up
hurting anyways and every time I've
tried anything I swear my gums have
gotten all gross or my teeth have just
been so sensitive that I couldn't even
drink cold or hot liquids after but I
decided to give these a try just because
I saw a photo and I was like no girl
those teeth are not okay and if your
teeth are gonna hurt then fine just put
up with it because of notine i've been
using them for about two weeks now and
my teeth are so much whiter it makes me
so happy to see pictures and see that my
teeth look so white and it just makes me
happy so i thought i would show it to
you guys especially for those of you who
do have sensitive teeth and you have the
same situation as me these are really
good and they do not hurt your teeth so
I definitely recommend them next is this
gleam by Melanie Mills and it's a body
radiance I don't know if it's like a
body radiance makeup it kind of gives
you the most beautiful tan and it
actually has shimmer to it so you look
like JLo in a music video
when she's just like glowing and
shimmering and she kind of looks dewy
all over I don't even know how to
explain it but this stuff is amazing and
it's a makeup as well so it kind of
blurs out any imperfections if you have
scars on your body yeah it just makes
you look like you're glowing from the
inside out and I absolutely love it the
only thing I would say is that I wish
the bottle was bigger like an actual
lotion size this is more of a face sized
bottle however you can use this on your
face
I just wish it was bigger because this
is gonna last me maybe like I don't know
a few weeks if I really Dallas my whole
body in it so yeah I really love it and
if you guys are going to make Haitian
and you just want to look super tan and
golden like a goddess I would highly
recommend this this okay so I'm just
going to talk to you guys about the
lipstick that is one of my favorite
nudes and I've also been wearing it
almost every day this month and I feel
bad because I hate posting pictures
where my makeup looks the same but when
you just love something you love it and
you want to wear it all the time and
that's how I feel about this lipstick
and I wouldn't even say it's a monthly
favorite although I'm putting it in this
video because I've worn it a lot this
month but I have been obsessed this
lipstick forever and the best part about
it is is that it's a drugstore lipstick
this is the Rimmel nude delight in the
number six for two and I'm going to show
you guys it's well loved there's barely
any left I absolutely love this I love
the consistency it's super creamy if you
get chapped lips really easily and maybe
a nude lipstick looks crusty because
let's face it when you try to put a new
matte lipstick on your lips if they're
crusty it's just in so this one is
hydrating it's shiny and almost looks
glossy at times but it's very opaque so
it's not transparent it's super rich I
don't know what else to say about it
besides it's amazing it's a nude
lipstick with peachy undertones and it
just complements any skin tones my
favorite nude lipstick it's my favorite
the last thing I want to talk to you
guys about is the Anastasia contour kit
and I know this has been out for a long
time and I've loved it for a long time
but recently she just launched a whole
new range of contour shades and
highlight shades and basically let me
show you guys this book that kind of
shows them boobs this bit hmm
anyways this is the book that she sent
out to all of the bloggers just to make
kind of share with you guys what's going
on and these are all of the new this is
difficult these are all the new contour
shades and these are all the new
highlighting sheets for a large range of
skin tones so what you do is you can go
to the store and you can pick any six
shades that you would like and you
customize your own palette and once you
pick the shades the palette comes for
free and so this is a new palette that
I've customized for myself and I've
absolutely been loving it I just I love
it and I kind of feel like the
consistency is even better this time
around
I'm not sure if it's different or if
it's just a mental thing but I kind of
feel like it's softer creamier it just
blends so beautifully and I love these
contour powders and highlight powders so
this is a definite recommendation I love
everything she does it's always
high-quality and yeah so I want to share
with you guys this cool new concept all
right guys so that was it for my July
favorites I hope you guys enjoyed this
video give it a thumbs up if you did and
if you didn't enjoy it just give it a
thumbs up anyways and let me know in the
comments below what products you've been
loving this month I would love to know
