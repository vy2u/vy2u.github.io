today's video is going to be my June
favorites so these are all the products
that I've been loving in this month and
maybe even before this month these are
all products that you guys have been
asking me tons of questions about
including skincare haircare travel
essentials and some other things that I
decided to throw into this video as well
you guys need to know where to find them
I link everything in the descriptor box
down there also I know that this is a
really simple makeup look it's really
easy to do it's nothing like new
spectacular or like innovative but let
me know if you guys want a tutorial on
it because I really really like how easy
and fast and neutral it is let me know
if you guys think I've recently been
struggling with my videos because I know
that I want to give you guys different
types of videos but then it's like half
of you are like give me color and half
of you are like do bronzed golden
neutral makeup so I'm over here like in
the middle trying to like please
everybody and make sure that I'm doing
enough of both so let me know if you
guys want a tutorial on this so if I get
yelled out later for doing this makeup
tutorial I can be like a Jenny Q 69 said
that she wanted me to do this video so I
believe it on you guys not me thank you
so much let me know alright so the first
product we're gonna talk about is by
coup de lis coup de lis coup de lei
Stephens got a google it so I don't say
it wrong coup de lis
coup Delhi that's how the computer told
us to say it cool Delhi this is the
beauty elixir and this has replaced my
mac fix+
I just think this gives your skin the
most beautiful glow and the glow stays
whereas with the mac fix+ it does make
your makeup stay and it does make your
highlight pop but it doesn't do anything
past that for me this one actually gives
my skin a really healthy glowy look I
use this for multiple reasons I before I
go to the gym I like to make sure my
skin is just like hydrated so I spritz
it with this my skin looks healthy with
no makeup on while I'm working out like
this just makes it glow which is nice
because you don't want to feel like a
total potato at the gym you want to feel
like fresh-faced this stuff is really
really good
I love it so much I also use this after
I apply my makeup to set everything it
has a scent to it that is fabuloso
sometimes I feel like I hear spa music
applying this every time I spray a
Stevens like what is that
it's like therapeutic it smells so good
it says it gives you a soothing glowing
complexion and that it definitely does
the stuff is amazing so the next product
is something that is also a non makeup
but makes you look really really fresh
and you see I've been getting a lot of
comments asking what I'm wearing on
snapchat in the mornings and throughout
the day on my lips to make them look
nice and juicy and glossy
it's the Murad soothing skin lip and
cuticle care this stuff is everything
this is not the bottle it actually comes
in it comes in more of like a chapstick
tube type container the only reason I
have this is because I got a facial by
dr. Murad himself which was amazing and
this was a while back and this is what
the estheticians have for their personal
use and he was like oh here take this
big bottle so this is not the container
it comes in but the product is exactly
the same it's just in a different
container if you guys go out and try to
purchase this they actually put this on
my under eyes and my lips when they gave
me my facial because my under eyes at
the time we're so dry I don't really use
this anywhere else besides my lips now
because my skin is kind of back to
normal this makes it look like you're
wearing the juiciest lip gloss I put
this on my lips before I go to the gym
so when I'm snapping in the morning this
is always what's on my lips it does come
in a smaller lip container it's almost
just like a regular squeezy tube
chapstick type container but this stuff
is amazing it has vitamin E conditions
helps relieved chapped cracked skin it
protects from the drying effects of the
wind or cold weather and it gently
exfoliates has BH A's
I don't know what ba J's are but it has
be a chaise to gently exfoliate to
smooth and revitalize it's amazing
definitely worth it and you look like
you're wearing lip gloss but it's really
treating your lips I have another
skincare product but I'm gonna bounce
around cuz I don't want to bore you guys
with skincare stuff so let's move on
next we're gonna go into a lip product
that I've been loving like wearing all
the time most of the time when you see
me
or this like cinnamony nudie lip it has
been the NYX soft matte lip cream in
abu-dhabi
this is like my favorite go-to color I'm
pretty sure I'm almost out because it's
starting to be a little bit difficult to
get product out of this I've been
wearing it on the go every single day
where I just want to have a nude lip
real quick it's easy to apply I don't
know if you guys have ever tried the NYX
lip creams they're just like frothy and
lightweight let me show you so this is
the color it actually would look really
nice with the makeup I have on now
but I chose not to wear it I've been
wearing it so much so I was like let me
give it a break real quick how pretty is
that color it complements everything
it's just the perfect warm cinnamony I
don't want to use the word ma because I
don't feel like it's that mom but like
it's like a cinnamon nude pink it's a
little ma B it's a little Mabi I
absolutely love this color and it's NYX
so it's really inexpensive every time I
wear this you guys ask me what's on my
lips it's always this color so the next
product is another makeup item and this
is something that if you follow me on
snapchat you saw me discover for the
very first time not too long ago this
brand actually sent me these palette I
have never used them before but I'm so
happy they did because I'm really
impressed with them it's a Sula beauty I
got these two palettes this is created
by a makeup artist a professional makeup
artist who actually felt the need for
these types of eyeshadows in the
industry and she created her own
eyeshadows the first palette looks like
this these are the shimmer shadows from
the line OOP these are just like all
individual eyeshadows and then you can
put them in palettes I use this in my
last tutorial and every single one of
these eyeshadows is like ridiculously
pigmented look at that color
don't mean to flip you guys off but look
at that color then we have this like
turquoise color bomb the purple color
amazing and then we have the gold color
which I used two tutorials ago I think
but these colors are so pigmented
they're like extra foil II just amazing
I didn't even need an eyeshadow base
boom this palette is all mattes and it's
the neutral necessity palette I'm
wearing this all on my eyes today it
looks like this I'm wearing this all
over my lid in crease and then this on
the outer
of the lid increase on top and bottom of
my lower lashline
these colors are so beautiful I love
that it's like neutral but then there's
these peachy plum bright colors as well
you have a white eyeshadow which is nice
for highlighting the brow bone a black
to deepen up any of these shades there's
this nice little nude tone and this is a
dusty pink color which is really really
pretty
these eye shadows just are really really
smooth I know everyone says the word
buttery and creamy and we need another
word for buttery and creamy they are
very smooth they are easy to blend and
they're pigmented a/s Suva Beauty check
them out we're going back into skincare
now this is the skin pseudo cools
advanced pigment corrector this is great
for anybody who is struggling with
pigmentation in their skin somebody who
has breakouts and the breakouts tend to
like leave marks I am latina so anytime
I get a breakout I swear the the mark of
the breakout lingers forever like it
just stays there and my skin is just
super susceptible to hyperpigmentation
when I was really breaking out in this
contour area here I just noticed I had
all these little spots and they wouldn't
go away so when I saw this product I was
like let me just give it a shot I've
been using it for about a month now and
it has really really helped reduce the
pigmentation on those spots I've been
really carefully watching them because
obviously I've been testing this product
and wanting it to work so badly it has
worked for me I didn't want to like
really show you guys this until I knew
that okay it was doing something because
it is pricey I think the price Ranger on
this is it's $90 it's expensive I really
really like it so I recommend this if
you really are struggling with
hyperpigmentation the next products we
have I have two haircare products here
the first one is the desange
replenishing oil this is going to be
really good for anyone who has over
processed hair aka lots of bleach lots
of breakage lots of damage it's okay
when my hair is a little bit damp I take
a few drops of it and I really focus it
on the ends you know those fried little
ends that you get I really focus it all
over and it's just going to help
revitalize your hair it's going to help
bring it back to like a shiny
version of your hair with all the you
know over-processed
mess that we do to it especially me I
went dark I came back to the light side
so fast I tried to like slide by without
saying anything about it like remember
when I went dark I made a whole video
and as I was going light like I just
kind of slipped it in there didn't even
say anything about it like let me just
get back to light hair I just feel more
comfortable this way I just had to say
it yes my hair is light again these are
extensions though my hair's not this
light anyways off topic this stuff is
really good for over-processed hair like
I said it's just gonna make your hair
feel really soft I tend to blow dry my
hair with a round brush so I love to
apply product to the ends or just like a
serum to the hair before doing that to
give it like a silky smooth finish you
guys ever see my hair an air dried
without any product in it it looks like
Top Ramen like really frizzy Top Ramen
so I always have to use something to
like kind of manage that this brings me
to the next haircare product this is the
Pravana the perfect blonde purple toning
shampoo I don't know why I grabbed it
like this but listen to me Latinas out
there
I only relate to having latina hair
because it's so hard to get blonde hair
without it turning orange it always
wants to turn orange I know this happens
with Asian hair as well you pull more
orange tones in your hair this stuff
will keep the brassiness at bay it
really really works I've tried a shimmer
light switch which I used to love a lot
then I switched to this one and I'm not
kidding you it changed my hair color
overnight right before I went to go get
my individual extensions I remember
talking to um Priscilla who did my
extensions about it and I was like yeah
my hair is really warm right now but I
don't want it to be that warm with the
extensions and the night before I went
to go see her I toned my hair with this
purple shampoo that's the first time I
ever used it the next morning I noticed
my hair looked completely different it
almost made it look blonde again instead
of warm it looked so nice and ashy and
when she did my extension she was like I
thought you told me her hair was really
warm and I was like hey it was until I
use this stuff so so far from all the
purple shampoos this has worked the
absolute best if you're looking for a
toning purple shampoo this one is great
the next item we have are the ooh the
urban decay
heavy metal liquid glitter liners these
life-changing
I honestly knew once I tried one of them
that I needed every single color just
for any makeup tutorial that may pop up
these are everything so they're just
glitter liners but they're super opaque
super sparkly every single time I use
these people ask what's on my eyes it's
this stuff it's really easy to use the
brush is so nice to create like a
glitter liner just easy and it's quick I
like to place the glitter on the inner
corner here or even like on top of my
winged liner or you could put it on the
outer part of the liner sometimes I dab
this in the center of like a halo smokey
eye just to add you know that pop of
glitter in the center so if you were to
only pick one the one that I use the
most is probably Midnight Cowboy which
is more of a gold liner that you could
use more often if you're looking to
purchase this but I also have amp
distortion spandex and this one is ac/dc
which I used in my last video personally
I haven't really used these colors yet
the blue and this white iridescent
glitter I have used these two they're
all amazing i've swatched them all you
are looking to try them for the first
time I definitely recommend Midnight
Cowboy this is just like a go-to and
it'll match any eye look bomb perfection
perfection and a glitter liner can get
these at Sephora
or Urban Decay's website don't play
yourself you need that the next item is
by benefit and it's give me brow going
back to how was talk to you guys about
things I do before the gym I don't
necessarily feel like I need to wear
makeup to the gym but I like to groom so
I don't look like a hot-ass mess and
give me brow is really nice because to
me technically it's not really makeup
it's just a tinted brow gel that you can
run through your brows and it actually
clings to the natural hairs I don't
think it says it it does that but I have
really little brow hair and it's
starting to grow more and more every
year which is very exciting for me still
like really sparse in this outer area I
used to be super self-conscious without
eyebrows I wouldn't go anywhere without
like a brow product now I'm a little bit
more secure and this stuff is so great
for
when I'm going to the gym because it's
just a tinted brow gel it has this tiny
little wand which is perfect to get into
all the hairs the tint is really nice
because it clings onto my existing hair
that I have and it makes them look
fuller
bushier and it keeps them in place so my
brows aren't like falling down you know
when they fall in this area here this
stuff is like hairspray it's super nice
strong holds and it just makes it look
like you have a brow without having to
apply a brow pencil it's quick if you
already have pretty good brows instead
of using a brow pencil even you could
just use this and be done with your
brows it just makes them look clean
groomed amazing there are two more
things left to talk about one being
something that I've mentioned so many
times but I'm going to put it in a
youtube video so that it exists on a
platform where you guys could find it so
this is the Monica dar travel mirror I'm
going to put it down now because I don't
want you guys to see like my mess in the
reflection really quickly I'll show you
that when you push this button it lights
up so it's really really good for travel
it's plastic and it's lightweight this
part comes off and then you could just
pack it away in your bag I'm obsessed
with this mirror because let me tell you
why when you go to a hotel and there's
terrible lighting there's really nothing
you can do about it when you have to get
ready it's like the worst feeling to
have to get ready in terrible lighting I
remember one time krispies and I stayed
at a hotel room and we literally had to
lay on the bed and look up into the like
ceiling lights just to do our eyeshadow
like it was the funniest thing I've ever
seen but that's the only good light we
had so that's what we did once I got
this mirror I made sure to travel with
it every single place I go to because it
is a lifesaver it just gives you good
lighting and it's easy to pack and you
never have to like rely on whether your
hotel room is going to have good
lighting now you guys know Monica Dora
that's the brand their makeup brand they
have like really good face powders that
I like that is clutch and then the last
thing I wanted to share with you guys as
my favorite is a TV show I thought that
I would throw in like a random favorite
whether it's like a food which is like
always going to be tacos pretty sure
it's never going to be food a song or a
TV show or something that I've just been
loving if you guys liked Desperate
Housewives
you're gonna love devious maids I just
started watching it on Hulu randomly
started watching it and I'm obsessed
with the show now I've like addicted to
it I've watched
every single season I hate being caught
up because now I have to wait like a
week for every episode to come out it's
like like I said it's like Desperate
Housewives so if you love that you're
gonna love this it's it's just with
maids instead of Desperate Housewives
The Maids just kind of you know go
around and they gossip about like what
goes on in their like homes if they work
in it's so juicy it's so good do you
guys watch that show I don't know if you
guys watch that show let me know in the
comments down below if you do so we can
just like you know talk about all the
crazy stuff that happens on that show
no spoilers though just in case anyone
else hasn't seen it I know it's on Hulu
not sure if it's on Netflix just thought
I'd throw it out there
don't blame me when you become addicted
to the show or blame me it's fine so
that is it for my June favorites those
are all the things that I've been loving
let me know what you guys have been
loving in the comments down below if
there's any new products things that I
should be trying or things that are
working for you guys I always like to
know sometimes it's like overwhelming to
try all these new products but if you
guys tell me like this specific product
is amazing I'm more inclined to try it
as well so yeah let me know in the
comments down below I hope you guys all
have or had depending on when this video
goes up a great 4th of July and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye
everything's falling blowing it oh it's
pretty bad why do I have to burp so much
we've I forgot how hot waves can be this
top is from misguided by the way you
guys are wondering this guy dated it's
actually a bikini coverup but it looked
good on film so breaking all the rules
Oh intro did you intro Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
