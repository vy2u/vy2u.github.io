today's video was highly requested by
you guys actually did this look the
other day and I posted it on Instagram
and you guys really liked it I know I've
done a crapload of bronzy makeup looks
to be honest they're my favorite makeup
looks and I feel like the most
flattering on everybody so that's why I
like to do a lot of them this one in
particular was not going to film but you
guys really really requested it it's
always like alright give the people what
they want
film the bronzy make look call it bronzy
makeup look vol 12 alright so let's go
ahead and get started with the tutorial
so the first thing I'm going to do for
this look is prime my skin I'm going to
use an illuminating primer this one is
by clever effects next I'm going to go
in with foundation this is a new one
that I'm trying out it's the fit me by
Maybelline it's the matte poreless one
yeah by the way this is in the shade 228
which matches perfectly to my neck I
wore this foundation all day yes
all day yesterday and it was pretty good
it lasted all day I didn't get really
oily or greasy the coverage is about
medium coverage I've already applied a
layer of the anasazi of Beverly Hills
clear brow gel over the brows next I'm
taking my Marc Jacobs eyebrow pencil in
the shade ashy Brown so I first like to
just go into the more sparse areas and
really fill those in I kind of want a
stronger brow today and then I put the
least amount of product in the front
like with a very light hand you just
kind of flick upwards here to clean up
the brow and highlight the brow bone I'm
using a little bit of concealer this is
my motives cosmetics and it's in the
shade amber with my makeup geek
concealer brush it's going to highlight
and if you have any stray hairs it's
going to cover them up I'd like to take
my finger and kind of blend it downwards
for the eyes I'm gonna lightly apply a
layer of Mac soft ochre Paint Pot with
my a zoeva 142 concealer brush so I just
kind of want to put a base on this area
of my eye just because I have so much
redness I feel like I've done so many
bronzy makeup looks because I have
they're my favorite makeup looks to do
but you guys really requested this
makeup look that I posted on my
Instagram so that's why I'm doing it for
you guys before anyone's liking all is
Dale bronze and I got this is my
favorite oh you see all the eyeshadow
come out oh ok this is my favorite
eyeshadow at the moment it's the Giorgio
Armani eyes to kill number 5 I know this
is pricey similar for something like
this would be any of the bronzed
eyeshadows from colour-pop kind of have
the same texture and really really
amazing pigmentation if you don't want
to spend I think this is like 30 bucks
or so at something ridiculous I took a
little bit of fix+ and damp oh I
got it on my mango it's fine dampen the
brush a little bit I'm just going to dip
it into the pot and I like to first get
all the excess like dust off on the back
of my hand so Oprah a so the reason I
like to apply it on the back of my hand
first because with eyeshadows like this
if you put a huge glob of it sometimes
the glob sticks there and then you can't
really move it around it like doesn't
look as even it's okay if you get a
little bit of it in the crease because
we're going to buff that out this is a
really good eyeshadow to use if you want
to look really nice but you don't want
to do a lot of work because really you
could just pop this on and then take a
blending brush let me get one take a
blending brush and just
to buff out the edges which is
originally what I thought I was going to
do when I was doing this makeup look
because I was about to go to a barbecue
with my husband's family my family my
in-laws and I was like oh we'll just do
this quick makeup look with this eye
shadow and then somehow I ended up going
like full edit oriole I don't know what
happened like I just kept going I was
feeling inspired this is all I was going
to do but as you guys can see when you
buff out the crease it almost looks like
you put a crease color into it it just
kind of buffs away the glitter and
leaves the pigmentation so it's really
really nice and if you wanted to just
leave it like that put a lot of mascara
on you'd be good to go I go into
corduroy which is the darker matte brown
color right here picking that up on a
Mac 217 I'm going to start really
pinpointing this in the inner part of
the eye and the outer part of the eye
layer brush right into the crease of
your eyeball right here and just give it
a little wiggle
if you like having dark in this inner
corner is really what makes it a
tutorial I don't know why just kind of
gives you like a really strong like a
dolce gabbana vibe I kind of flick
whatever is left over upwards towards
the brow for the outer corner I'm taking
this makeup geek defined crease brush
perfect for this area and we're going to
create the outer V portion so uh the
only thing I want to say about this
lorac matte palette is that I feel like
there's a lot of fallout sometimes
alright so flick upwards in the outer
corner and then bring it in take the
other blending brush and diffuse it out
I like to have my eye open for this look
kind of look straight ahead because then
you can see how the shape looks with the
eye open I'm going to keep building the
intensity on this outer V area with the
dark brown shadow but if you guys can
see this red that we blended up here or
whatever the eye shadow we blended here
it's really bothering me I don't know
there's just like a cloud of red here
that's not like connecting so what I
like to do when that happens is take a
bone colored eye shadow I'll just pick
this one up here maybe mix it with a
little bit of the white just a light
eyeshadow and I like to clean it up like
this
see like it starts to clean up those
mistakes you can kind of just buff them
away define your your shape a little bit
more and then after I can take a
blending brush and just kind of buff out
the edges so it doesn't look like a
white line going across
I'm going to do my under eye concealer
first and then finish off the eyes
I've been trying out this it cosmetics
bye bye under-eye this is in the shade
tan right in the hollows here and then
to set that I'm gonna use a super light
layer of the Laura Mercier translucent
powder most of it off on the back of my
hand and then after you do that gets the
excess off
just going to lightly run it over the
under eyes go back into the eye shadow
that we used and I'm gonna run that on
my lower lash line
so now I'm going back into the dark
brown eyeshadows that we used in the
crease on a small detail shader brush by
zoeva and I'm going to deepen up the
outer corner for an inner corner
highlight I'll be using the mary lou
manizer by the balm cosmetics in the
photo I posted I just curled my lashes
and added mascara that's kind of the
look I was going for if you look at the
photo it pretty much looks like I don't
even have eyelashes I will be using the
NARS audacious mascara
all right so my eyelashes uh did not
come through for me right now so I'm
gonna apply falsies you could leave it
like this with just mascara but I think
I'm going to step it up a notch and add
these socialized lashes in these style
minks so now the eyes are completely
done let's finish off the face the face
was a lot of bronzer I'm not gonna lie
to you guys I applied Mac's give me Sun
for a good five seven minutes
I just kept applying more bronzer and
this is like my favorite brush at the
moment to apply it it's the Mac one
three five just because it's so large
and in charge
start applying it in the hollows of my
cheek bones and then I sweep it upwards
but when I did this makeup look I was
sitting in my living room on the floor
per usual and I think I was having a
conversation with Steven and I was just
like this yeah anyways like forever I
got just applying more and more and more
bronzer I'm gonna use another Mac
mineralize skinfinish this one is in
gold deposit I've actually had this for
so long for all I know
could be expired I don't know it gives
off really fine gold flecks with a
little bit of a bronzey tint I'm kind of
just going to go over right where we
added the give me Sun so you guys can
see it just gives like a little light
I'm quickly going to contour my nose
using my Mac Studio Fix and NC 43 this
is just a powder foundation so I like to
use this because it gives a more natural
contour to the nose and of course I'm
using a dirty-ass Mac 217 but we're just
going with it
with this look I actually would like to
take it up into the inner part of the
nose bridge now it's time to finish
highlighting the skin I'm using mary lou
manizer by the balm because to me this
is like the most intense highlight that
I have and we want that intense
highlight oh
here OSHA's and then of course the
Cupid's bow for blush I'm using this one
by hot makeup just because I still want
it to look more bronzy not so much of
like a blush so I made quite the little
mixture of lip products when I did this
I first used yash lipstick by Mac took
the laura geller highlighter and gilded
honey just this one right here and I'm
just going to start applying that all
over my lips pretty much the top of the
lip here and I kept it in the center
then I put a little bit of gloss this
one is by Makeup Forever it's the artist
Plexiglas in 100p just this really nice
nudey gloss so I'm going to apply this
right over it
and go ahead and set everything with my
mac fix+
this is going to make all the powders on
our face like melt and look more like
skin less like powder that's it we're
done
so really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial like I mentioned you guys can
totally alter this look to whatever
suits you or what you like less bronze
or more bronzer or more highlight or
less highlighter yeah let me know what
