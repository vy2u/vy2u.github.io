we're going to show them in the video so
I'm gonna be doing Kim's makeup today
and she's also going to be showing me
her contour techniques with the powder
contour kit should we just get right
into a video let's go sure thing I can't
see you pushing there she actually got
her iPad
oh she's swiping hey Farrah are you
watching mama he's actually going to
produce this whole thing directed what I
know what we're doing
yes tell us if we're doing anything
wrong north okay thumbs up subscribe
go ahead shrine Isis if you first we're
going to start off by moisturizing your
skin so that it's all nice and glowy
even though your skin is kind of already
glowing this is like my cool throwback I
love this have you tried the new one
it's like the whole of light so it has
more of like a Goldy reflect whereas the
other one had a little bit more like a
pinky undertone but yeah this one is
everything it's so nice wow I have any
second so I love it so much every time I
do a tutorial I just go home and go
makeup shopping I feel like I haven't
updated my products in a while it's like
- the illini are like I know you kind of
just stick to it and I do that'll do and
it's funny because even if I've tried
something and it didn't really work for
me if I see somebody use it on YouTube
I'm like mm-hmm I want to use that too
you know I remember a long time ago it
was the Midori of it you are the green
dress but
like photographs everywhere I met you
there that was the first time I ever met
you I was that in Miami it was Emma and
I like green goo cheese oh that was such
a beautiful dress I still haven't do you
keep all the dresses mm-hmm you do hold
you where do you keep them
does she have storage from whatever
generation facility that I keep
I have even like some of my old Arab a
linear dresses when I was so throwbacks
yeah everybody was obsessed
I always keep things that like give me
good great memories you know like
clothing pieces you just can't get rid
of them you're just like no I want to
keep that memory even though Stephen
always told me I need to clean out the
closet I was like it's sentimental I
can't clean it out you know I know you
just have to have like a different
closet for it well I think he's upset
because it's in his closet and then I
don't be a product yeah who has who has
a bigger closet you were funny you know
what I bet his archive is bigger because
he keeps everything then keeps it
separate like totally outside of the
house since we're doing more of a smoky
look I think I'm going to do the eyes
first I'm so excited to use a new
eyeshadow oh it's crazy that the first
person I'm ever putting the eyeshadows
on other than you know the immediate
team is Kim let's I'm so excited me t
North do you want to do my makeup next
yeah what if she does a better job than
me speaking of the North what age do you
think that you'll start letting her wear
makeup probably twelve that's I think
when I started wearing makeup twelve
yeah that's when I started to get into
it and then when I was like 14 my dad
got me makeup lessons and they
videotaped it and showed us how to on
liner and lashes they're really just
into actually contour and concealer
mm-hmm I was like ah like on a nude
monochromatic
we shouldn't I know appropriate now yeah
it's like so my vibe and probably why I
like the kind of makeup that I like I
have a lot of regrets like the bright
turquoise eyeshadow I saw Tyler right
turquoise now and match it with like
bright turquoise close eye I will top
you one and I actually meshed it with
turquoise context no it was so bad and I
matched it with turquoise like hair
clips that were these flowers and so I
think it was like in though you know
what
we were cool back then so mm just
cleaning up a little bit under the brows
we're going to do a base
I am debating dyeing my hair blonde and
everyone's like you should do your hair
like Jesse's cover oh really funny that
we always want to just change up our
hair so often you know I know and it's
so hard I tried going dark and I don't
know I just didn't feel myself that I
love dark hair so much that I wanted it
to work it really really works on you
and it's like hard to get the perfect
color yeah it is
and it's like all about matching to your
skin tone because somebody wants to owe
me that anybody can be blond but it has
to be the right undertone but not a lot
of people get right I look back at some
of my blondes and it was super orange
yeah and it just I looked all one color
I did this one and it was really orange
II it's just such high maintenance
hmm I want to do it like more like going
whitish platinum II oh yeah I love when
you were behind them too
how hard was that so hard do you think
I'm going to do it though what did you
enjoy the most out of creating makeup
products for me I wanted to start with
probably the hardest product I just got
into cream contour like two years ago
just from me wanting a lighter look and
I know people probably associate contour
with having to be really heavy and I see
a lot of like makeup it's funny because
I see the consumer saying oh my gosh
this is so easy this is great and then I
see like the makeup gurus want more
humor and I'm like it's not like
pigmented enough I really wanted it for
the consumer to be really user friendly
yeah to show people like okay contour is
not that scary you don't have to go that
heavy and if you want to go heavier put
powder on top and layer it but like
let's go really just enhancing the
features well exactly and so I think
just my most like proud moment was just
seeing so many people that typically
wouldn't use contour get into it and
really love it and fall in love with the
process and just when you work so hard
on like creating a formula and you
change it so many times and yet it to be
a certain way when you finally get a
sample back and it's the right formula
you're just you're so hot I did and a
lot a lot from like talking to people
and I love getting people to be about
positive or even negative
and love the like seeing people open the
product for the first time and using it
and seeing it I get so into it I can't
wait for that for like the outing of
that yeah like when you saw people out
there wearing your shadow it'll be like
the best feeling all right I'm going in
with the Mario palette here taking a
nice neutral shade for a transition
color so pretty do you edit your videos
yourself I used to always edit all my
videos and now Steven helps me edit them
when I first started YouTube and I watch
people make youtube videos I thought it
was like oh how nice it must be just to
just film a makeup look and I didn't
think it was that hard I was like wow
that must be is so nice and easy
but there's so much more that goes into
it behind the scenes Mar just like even
getting the right lighting when I first
started I had like The Incredible Hulk
lighting and I looked so green I look
back at the videos I mean I would tell
Steven like I don't know what it is but
I think I'm green and he's like no I
promise you you're not years later he
goes back to my video and he's like yeah
you were really greener and yeah sorry
about that but it's nice having I hope
you know that's so cool my brother helps
me take pictures now too so it's like
we're just like a little family unit
we're going to do bronze but then we
changed it up last minute I want to do
something a little bit more smokey
I'm just swirling like a deep dark brown
shade on the outer V of the eye just
circular motions have you ever gotten
your makeup done a time at counter yeah
I know all the time I lived right behind
a MAC store on Robertson so I walk over
there and get my makeup done I used to
always go to the Mac color to go and
make a bed it was the best yeah I got my
pro makeup done there I did - you did
yeah what kind of look did you do I did
kind of like this purpley spotted I know
remote was a thing though that was my
boyfriend's prom and then so then my
actual prom I did a burgundy look good
old days my I remember my dad was like
you mean you look very pretty but you
just don't look like yourself looks like
yeah my dad used to freak out
that's why he got the makeup lesson he's
like you girls are gonna have to learn
to do this right that's nice let your
dad's that my dad still till the states
like when I could show up with no makeup
he's like oh this is exactly how I like
you know makeup
sweet what's your favorite type of
makeup cuz I could wear one look for the
rest of my life it would definitely be
really sleek straight hair with like a
really matte like chiseled probably but
I could cut crease but on nude tone I
love that too people always told me that
I just always do bronzy looks but that's
just what everybody actually really
loves to wear that I know I remember
when I did the collab with Kylie for the
lips they're like for nudes why are you
doing for nudes I'm like that's all I
wear and there's lots of shades of nude
there is and people don't realize that
it's like every skin tone really needs a
different type of nude I mean there's a
lot that are universal but for my
skintone I have a lot of olive so it's
hard for me to find a nude that just
like always works every day and that's
not too light or too dark having a be
too light is really frustrating because
it just will completely ruin the look
what new do you well I just created nude
lipsticks as well like regular Linux so
I've been using those but before that I
think I always mixed peach stock with
like something darker just whatever I
could find I never really had to go to
before yours what was your go-to
actually this Revlon or something really
cheap but I love Charlotte Tilbury these
nudes oh yeah she had a lot of job with
her nude formulas nice too how is it now
different having a boy than a girl I
hear boys are easier but are they not
now now thanks I'll because they always
want to run around it's like totally
different energy North can like lay in
bed with me and maybe it's like the age
too but she'll watch cute shows like the
shows that he wants to watch her there's
completely different and he just wants
to run around 24/7 I like grew up with
all brothers that's all I know like boys
so I'm always I when I picture myself
having kids I picture boys my advice on
that is every time you want something
you go yeah at the opposite so just go
with an open mind
yeah well if I got a girl you know I'd
still be happy - one thing is I wish I
could do my makeup better can you do a
winged liner only if I had to what is it
like if it's an emergency or the last
person
yes yes I'm not at all really geeky you
can give yourself a wing you're okay
because that's really hard to do when I
was younger my mom would do her eyeliner
winged liner liquid in two seconds and
it would be the most perfect wing I
would look at her and I was like mom how
do you how do you do that and she's like
don't worry sweetie one day you'll be
able to do it too and every day I would
just try it over and over and over again
and eventually I got good and that's all
I did was winged liner I didn't wear any
other makeup like no brows no mascara
nothing this is just a wing so you
Joseph's colors yes yeah I love them too
so these are the shadows oh they're so
good I love them so much I'm really
happy with how they look you know okay
look how this is a gray and brown this
is one we're going to use today it's
like a really deep brown with bluey
purple reflex all over it so it looks
really sparkly round yeah it looks like
brown that's what ray started with
bronzy but with glitter at the same time
I want to be using turbo song by the way
we named all the eyeshadows after our
dogs because that's what we do before
you got here we were talking about how I
put in only in school because it's a
school for puppies no way and it's just
the cutest thing ever they even have
like graduations but she's gotten so
much better since we started taking her
there wow it looks so pretty I'm like so
happy seeing it like how much it
sparkles under these lights - I just
thought this little call youtuber she
was doing like her faces Arial and
obviously her mom was coaching her
through but she looked like she was like
five or six years old and was doing like
full like beauty blender like everything
full cut crease like not in creator i
doing her brows like it was so crazy so
advanced at such a young age yeah the
fact that you notice I'm like six years
old is wild
I can it be my daughter she's gonna be
baking we should probably bake you don't
even know she's really like baking
tweeze like what an influence our moms
are just when it comes to like makeup
and stuff I'm sure that probably why she
likes it so much I think that's who we
always see at first you know or mom
I stole a Christian Dior lipstick once
for my mom in a little I wouldn't say I
stole like she's my mom but I definitely
took it for my makeup bag and never gave
it back to her
that's what I would say I was exactly
but um I actually stolen let's take one
from writing oh I think I think we've
all been there I think it was like a
thing I think I stole lip gloss from
Bath and Body Works once and I'll never
forget it
yeah we didn't get in trouble we didn't
get caught it was from Rite Aid in
Malibu I'll never forget it it was me
and Nicole Richie I'm 11 years old
we were like could not believe we still
you know came home and you like looked
at you're losing your life yeah lining
your lashline with a little black pool
liner this one is Maybelline do you ever
have like just an embarrassing makeup
moment and it was like photographed or
something I'm I mean I look back at how
white I used to do my undereyes I think
everybody loved that though I know what
it's like was so white so crazy so like
that's funny
you were so experimental with all your
makeup that Lea just like the
makeup world I feel like you and Mario
and whoever all we gotta like start just
wearing lots of color when he does do
different ratio looks it's just like the
pictures was viral and every single
person's always like can you do this Kim
Prudential makeup look can you recreate
this a humorous your makeup look what
would you be doing if you weren't doing
what you're doing now my friends and I
took all the time that I would
definitely be a good publicist but I
think I would be like a forensic
investigator forensic investigator
really was I don't know it's just like
what I feel like I could do really well
and I am really fascinated just
differently trials and huh it's like all
the kind of shows i watch I'm gonna be
going home now and watching Dateline
you'll get like sucked in like sucked in
what kind of lashes do usually where
individuals I like I can barely put
lashes on harder if this drug is like
really thin hmm yeah that's tricky don't
need a lot you could put like maybe if
you tried the outer corner once mm-hmm
those are a little bit easier had asked
them to I like those three you know
those like individual human three little
clusters yeah yeah those are like a girl
would be into that here mm-hmm
- you're like best skincare tip I'd love
to try so many different products and it
is about trying so many different things
I think always having my skin
moisturized this is like my favorite
powder I know Charlotte Tilbury so nice
going back into the Mario palette and
taking a nice warm toned brown shade I
love a smokey under-eye I always put
some kind of shadow on my under eye even
if it's just bronzer like makes your
eyes pop a lot ml time just like holding
her hair I was like like a curtain I
just realized I was holding it for no
reason and say you know that it's not
mine I guess I thought it's yours if you
bought it yeah anybody have real anymore
I used to have really good long hair
like I'll look back at pictures might be
like those are the days when I like
didn't even know what hair extensions
are ashes were and it looks good Lerner
is pretty good though I just cut it
really blunt and that was really hard
how do you blend it so well isn't it
harder I have a blunt haircut do i braid
it under oh that's spilling there's the
blunt cut it which is the front secrets
revealed
yeah this is like my number one because
I know your hair shorter and I've always
liked my she hide her short hands - bye
honey where he says I glue in my like up
to here and so anyone's Elaine IVRS yeah
yeah but I'm going to get this little
piece right here oh yeah I haven't it
out and it's like right here my little
friend that's actually just my short
hair because you can't really braid the
front part so you really have to like
blend them up pieces really well that's
go honestly like I'm so happy that he
like discussed that because I've always
wanted to know my hair's really what I
got like a pretty bad haircut I'm always
trying to find ways to blend it like
I've been eyeing up my short hair at the
bottom and it really helps if you like
braid him under before straight nurse
were popular did you do this like I
would earn my hair off unlike an ironing
board and now like back in the day I
knew nothing about hair I still don't
know anything about hair
like how to do my own hair one time we
put frizzies in my hair before doing it
and it sizzled my hair all the way up
like some whale yeah my hair like
sizzled and it was the front pieces
mm-hmm those are like some of my biggest
mistakes I think one time Courtney told
me to use Jolene
it's like bleach like for your arm hair
like some other like body hair yeah way
too percent of my hair hit that and it
like me my hair orange she really did
always want to go to touch me we should
stop a touch her and tell her you're
going to do her makeup really good and I
don't like do it really bad
yeah give her a legging girl give her
like a skull maybe we don't get at
Halloween makeup that's my favorite I
mean that's when I got started that's
when I loved looking at on like
Instagram I did this like melting skull
last year and I loved it so much I love
uses like some of my favorite because
they're celebrating kind of spiky either
like the iconic lights alright we have
something new this is my contour and
highlight palette this is the medium so
there's three different kinds of this
there's a lighter one we kind of more
like gray undertones for really good for
later skin and then the highlighters
this one's a more Goldy tone and then I
have a more pink undertone they have two
highlights two powders and is that what
you intend to this for more of a overall
and of like longings how Yan is a little
bit warmer and one is a little bit more
for sculpting and just to add a little
bit more depth yeah I think about our
contour is really self-explanatory I
think it's not intimidating maybe less
than somebody yeah so weird like
everyone's intimidated by cream contour
and I really wanted to break that mold
and show people that it doesn't have to
be that Gary and with the powder
I think everyone's going to love it so
easy to use and it was just highlighting
sleek and chic it's like a soft touch
right yeah Matt soft touch mhm
it's really simple I'm a good big mirror
beauty of these brushes whether it is
the one with the cream contour you can
twist the brush off or on the other one
it's a brush and a sponge so you can
really use them however you want if you
want to add it to this one oh you can
take the same size brush you can use
them interchangeable this one the more
angled one I use
kind of just sculpt and even like
lightly sculpt my nose a little bit and
then I use this one that kind of looks
like a bigger paintbrush like a blush
brush but I use it really just to like
add the highlight and then you know just
down the nose or where I wave it alright
you want me to give it a go yeah I think
we're going to warm up the face first
with the warmer shade nice bronzy glow
oh yeah this is really nice and like
sunny I love one of the colors in the
light that I could use for me too in the
cream contour kits I use the medium for
daily and then I like use the dark some
of the shades just to warm me up even
darker when I'm really tan I'm
definitely just medium palette but there
is one of the colors in the light that I
feel like is a really good matte bronzer
that's just a really good shade it's so
nice to have different shades like light
medium and dark because it's hard for
especially fair-skinned to find a good
bronzer or contour even dark to on the
darker spectrum I don't want to use yeah
other sites like I when I do it I just
kind of like I've always gone like this
and overdo it and just like really kind
of I'm aggressive with it I'm such a
soft like keep taking them like with
powder you can just be a little bit more
yeah and I think always do the middle
sometimes degree don't want a lot of
blush like I do go higher yeah and I
obviously put more here yeah or I'll go
like the darker color if you use my
hands a lot she's going in and he's like
she's going and I guess you could be
like rougher on yourself yeah that's I
think what it is when you do someone
else's makeup you're like trying to be a
little bit more delicate but when you do
it to yourself you're just I didn't go
on tour today so I could use this oh
this should actually really ties in my
crease you know what I do is this is
probably like the total wrong thing to
do but if I put on a little too much
sometimes I'll take this brush part and
I'll put a little bit of foundation on
it oh and oh oh it weren't just like and
then I'll take this lighter side I'm all
like kind of into the pinky tone oh
great I like to put a lot of bronzer on
my forehead too I feel like it like yeah
look shorter I think that's my thing I'd
love a short for him too do you like how
that's a bit oily
Mario like loves that he like adds
highly roar I do that too I like that is
like just lightly there and lightly
right on my chin like right where you
think people would not it yeah I like
that as well and I always put on a lot
of it then I go over it with like
whatever I used to think what you said
and then it kind of like I mention it
yeah into the skin now your golden
goddess these are the collection with
Kylie's yeah they're all your liquid
lipsticks and they're all news which I
love thank you so much for all the news
