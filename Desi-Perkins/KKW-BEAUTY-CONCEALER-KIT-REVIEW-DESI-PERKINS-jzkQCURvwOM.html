as you can see I have no foundation no
concealer and that's because I'm gonna
be testing out the new k'kaw concealer
kits today so this is my first time even
opening this PR package I haven't really
seen the concealers yet I've seen things
on Twitter I've seen pictures on
Instagram but I haven't really played
with them or seen them in person myself
but with every PR kit we kind of get a
information sheet so I'm gonna be
looking at this to see what it claims
what it says it's supposed to do so
initially I will say that when I open
this PR box I see that there's light
light medium medium to dark and then
maybe dark however on the sheet it says
that it's supposed to be light medium
dark and deep dark I definitely don't
think that the dark is is dark because I
feel like I would pull from the dark
section and my skin complexion isn't
that dark I'm not sure if this shade
range already off the bat is true to
what it's saying here I do feel that at
this point everybody should just be
expanding their shades you know like
what's why not I think there should be
just one more section of for after the
deep dark because it looks like just
dark to me so that's just my initial
first impression when I opened the PR
box the second thing I will say is that
when I think of Kim Kardashian I
definitely think of the under eye
brightening technique that her and Mario
have been doing for so many years so it
gets me excited another thing I see in
the PR kit is this and this is exciting
to me because if you guys don't follow
Ponyboy on Instagram he is an incredible
artist and I've been following him
forever he does fashion sketches he does
all types of drawings and looks like Kim
K asked him to do this little mock-up
all right so now let's go over some of
the details of each product says these
products are supposed to have anti-aging
ingredients fruit extract formulas to
help reduce fine lines and wrinkles
improve hydration improve skin
smoothness and make skin appear firmer
and more elastic over time how much time
I would like to know like like today
tomorrow I just want to know because I
would like all of those things to be
happening for me three-step process is
what Mario and I have perfected after
working together all of these years let
me tell you I've seen Kim Kardashian in
person okay I've done her makeup and her
skin is like perfection perfection but
says that the concealers are full
coverage liquid concealer with an ultra
creamy hydrating formula perfect for
correcting and highlighting and perfect
for everyday used alone or in
conjunction with the baking and
brightening powders what it says about
the baking powder is that it's a
lightweight non-drying velvety powder
formula it creates a soft diffuse finish
these Universal translucent powders come
in shades suitable for every skin tone
perfect for baking and setting the under
eye and then the last product which is
kind of the product I'm most excited
about and that's the brightening powder
just because I do think of Kim K when I
think of under-eye brightening this is a
silky pressed powder infused with fine
brightening pearls which add radiance
under the eyes and help to create a
fresh and awakened look there are also
two brushes this one we are all familiar
with I don't know if this is like
exciting to anybody this brush this one
on the other hand is new to me this is a
dual sided brush one has a flat
concealer side and the other is more of
a fluffy brush for me I don't really use
the flat side so much for under-eye but
everybody uses different tools right and
then the blending one I would use this
more for crease and like nose contour
it's an interesting choice for a
concealer brush but like I said everyone
does everything different I am so used
to beauty blenders there's one more
thing she is selling these products in
bundles or you can buy the products
individually bundles are $80 and that
includes the concealer the baking powder
the brightening powder and the brushes
and then if you buy everything
individually everything is $18 each so
something to take into consideration
now we're past all the boring
first things first since I'm reviewing
something I want to make sure to use a
foundation that I'm familiar with that I
know I like so I'm gonna quickly go
ahead and apply a little foundation all
over my skin to get our base going and
I'm just gonna do this really fast cuz
it's not about the foundation it's about
the concealer so I will be right back
okay so we have a nice light layer of
foundation on our face don't mind my
neck I didn't take it down there because
it's not about the neck okay right away
I gravitate towards the little section
that's supposed to be deep I'm not sure
let's see
color-wise you know what helps when you
are shopping for concealers are trying
to find your color I always take my
current concealer and I swatch it on my
hand so that I could make sure I find a
match closest to that looking at the
concealer packaging the first thing I
notice is the size it is very mini which
also then makes me think of the amount
of product that is in here 0.162 fluid
ounces which isn't that much product I
wish there was oh I'm gonna go ahead and
try shape number eight I'm like trying
to look like her drawing you know I'm
gonna do one eye at a time cuz I'm not
sure how this product dries down some
concealers dry quicker than others
alright so I'm gonna go ahead and blend
that in I already know that I'm not a
fan of the sponge tip on this brush I'm
not gonna use that it's not a new
product see yeah it does dry down fast
right here I can see a line like it
dried down I didn't blend it in time
which is not bad just make sure you do
what one eye at a time I've got to get
up into my red under-eye here so eight
is little light for me and this is the
last shade in the medium cluster of
concealers and it still looks a little
light so now I'm going into the deep
section and I'm just gonna apply it on
top and hopefully it'll kind of balance
it out but do you see how the shade it's
a little off to me in like the sections
the the color titles it got like really
light over here I'm just gonna go ahead
and use this
on the other side just cuz so we could
see what it looks like so this is just
nine I do like that this one has a
peachy undertone I feel like it'd be
really good for darkness oh that's so
much better
Wow so number nine is definitely my
shade way nicer than eight yeah it was
just a little too bright wow what a
difference that makes okay see now when
I look at this under I'm like that looks
really good
this one a little ashy you know cuz I
used a color that was a little too late
now I'm getting a better impression of
the product over here on this side okay
I feel really good about this side I
feel like the coverage looks nice
you're like my under eye looks like like
a smooth transition no like deep hollows
whereas like this one I feel like
there's a little I think it was just too
light and so instead of helping me it's
like hurting me I'm gonna go ahead and
redo this side this is the part where
now I get concerned so if my concealer
shade is from like the dark section now
I'm like do I use the dark powder so
we're gonna go ahead and go into number
three and I think that was gonna work
it's very yellow very banana right off
the bat this is a really finely milled
powder like super thin not like Laura
Mercier where it's like a little denser
this is really really light I'm just
gonna bake like that for a minute
and then a tip also anytime you're doing
your concealer make sure you blend it
out with your Beauty Blender before you
bake like don't even blink just blend it
out and put the powder on before you
make any crazy facial movements you know
the true test is if this gives flashback
since I'm here baking I might as well
just contour my nose with the concealer
as well see how that goes I'm gonna use
the color that was too light for my
under eye which is eight so what I do
like about concealer is that dried down
quickly is doing the line down the nose
with them because I feel like it dries
down just enough to leave that straight
line shape but you can blend it up hit
it a little hard on the Cupid's bow here
I'm gonna blend out this nose highlight
I'm feeling pretty good about it right
now
optimistic about what's happening here
on my face you know what let me bake
down the bridge of my nose too because
why not
and then let me use the little brush to
put some of that on the forehead I'm
gonna go ahead and dust off all the
baking needs this little brush for the
nose now that I dusted off the powder
I wish the powder gave me a little bit
more blur here but I do like the overall
brightness it left and then also I feel
like the sides of my nose feel pinched
in so I like the brightness it put there
on the on the side and I also feel like
the lined oh my no stayed pretty bright
I like that so this is the brightening
powder I'm just gonna use number three
keep it going with a section three here
said to use this side for a light
dusting so let's go over this like
hollow area here and see what happens
this is number three and I'm feeling
like I'm a little too bright so here's
my problem I think these are too light
and then if I go up a color it goes
straight to this color so it would go
from three to number four which is very
orange the brightening powder oh man I
loved everything up until that I thought
I was gonna really like it okay okay
let's try the brightening powder on the
side of the nose and see how that works
because I love this area to be brighter
so let me just keep working with it
oh I'm so sad let me just reset that
because I didn't I didn't love the
brightening powder I'm trying to make it
work because I was really excited about
it but it's too bright for me I need a
color in between three and four Kim
please what I mean I feel like the
setting powder brightened me like enough
after that I think it's a little too
much for me but I'm gonna try using this
to brighten the bridge of my nose and
other little area
like that and see what happens okay okay
wait does this have a sheen I feel like
it's like highlight II like I like a
sheen do you see this this is the
brightening powder on my skin do you see
that like on my skintone that color for
me it just doesn't work it's almost a
little too shiny or something so I'm
gonna go ahead and finish my makeup I'll
be right back oh I just added a little
gloss a little blush I guess now it's
time for final thoughts right now let's
just go over the pros and the cons that
I found when trying this product let's
start with the cons I'm gonna say that
the color range could be extended in all
three categories of the products there's
some gaps there's some gaps I wish the
brightening powder didn't have so much
of a sheen for me I feel like the
brightening powder is gonna be great for
the bridge highlight that's what I would
use it for just like highlighting the
bridge of my nose so I don't know if
I'll use the brightening powder again I
think I need another color
maybe it's the color maybe if the color
matches your skin tone it might work
great for you but other con would be if
you bought the bundle this brush comes
with it and I kind of feel like I don't
really I don't need this brush I feel
like I already have my Beauty Blender
and I'm comfortable with that I don't
know if I should put this in a calm
because I think this is a nice brush I
actually love the dual ended concealer
and then fluffy brush but I probably
wouldn't use this brush for these
particular products except flat brush
would be nice to use the brightening
powder down the bridge of the nose but
other than that I personally wouldn't
use it for anything else now I'm gonna
talk about the pros of this product the
pros are I love the concept I think that
having a concealer kit is so perfect
especially for Kim Kardashian because
like I said when we think of her I swear
I think of like concealer I think of
under eye brightening the concept is
kind of genius for her like actually I
think she should have come out the gate
with this I feel like people would have
been like oh yes that's Kim Kardashian
and I think it's awesome that she did it
another Pro I love the concealer I'm
actually pleasantly surprised I'm very
picky with concealers especially really
close to my under eye but I feel like it
looked really really good and shade 9
really really worked out for me I like
that a lot
the tones have that really peachy
undertone to really cancel out dark
circles but I also like the powder I
will say this is very different from
what I'm used to and what I love the
most actually about the powder is that
it really brightened up the sides of my
nose and kind of like pinched it in I
thought that was really nice it doesn't
have any coverage it's not gonna like
smooth out your pores this powder where
I feel like if you're comparing it to
Laura Mercier you can pack it into your
pores on your cheeks which I do and it
kind of smoothes it out I really like
this from the sides of my nose I think
it's really nice now having used the
product I'm really excited to see what
other people's reviews are all about and
what they think about the product
because everyone's so different everyone
likes different things and I also want
to know what you guys think like you saw
me apply the concealer on camera what
did you think
I love those two two out of three not
too bad oh wait you know what I did want
to see I wanted to do a flash
photography chest because as you guys
know baking can sometimes cause
flashback if the powder is not right so
I'm gonna go ahead and insert a flash
photography picture right here so that
you guys can see whether I have flash
back or not all right that is it thank
you guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this review let me know what you
guys thought give this video a thumbs up
if you liked it and I'll see you guys in
my next video bye what's that mom did
you see here I mom did that see get the
items from Kim Kardashian yes mom I'm
here filming a review yes what is the
odds of her calling and saying that oh
she literally called us to say did you
get that things from Kim Kardashian I'm
sure I'll do a little yeah this is
really heavy
are you kidding me no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
