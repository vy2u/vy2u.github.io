so this video is going to be on Kylie
Jenner's makeup at the Golden Globes
afterparty whether you're a fan of the
Kardashians and the Jenners or not
because a lot of people comment about
you know doing more Kylie looks or this
and that and why is everyone doing their
makeup looks and at the end of the day
it's about the artists and I feel like
sometimes people forget that the artists
makeup by arielle did this makeup look
on her and it was absolutely stunning I
will link his Instagram right over here
so you guys can check him out and this
is the reference picture right here of
Kylie at the after party Golden Globes
events she looked stunning it's amazing
how the makeup look just really brought
her whole outfit together I think if it
was any other makeup it wouldn't have
been as eye catching and I think that's
what makes a great artist so you guys
should definitely check him out he does
a lot of great makeup so if you guys are
interested in this makeup look then keep
on watching for this tutorial I'm going
to be using items from the Ipsy glam bag
this month to hydrate my under eyes
while I do the eyeshadow I'm going to be
using the hada labo Tokyo Xpress renewal
eye mask and this is just going to firm
and smooth the under eye we're going to
start with skin prep I'll be using the
pur Lisse Blue Lotus 4 and 1 I adore a
serum this cream says it fights wrinkles
which is totally what I need next I'm
going to use a little bit of lip balm
this is actually a board-and-batten it's
like an overnight nourishing balm but
I'm going to use it right now because my
lips are really dry for primer I'm going
to be using the makeup forever
step 1 skin equalizer and this is the
smoothing primer it's going to fill in
any larger pores and fine lines for
eyeshadow primer i'll be using the
smashbox 24-hour photo finish shadow
primer so now i'm going to set my
eyeshadow base with a little bit of
translucent powder just the laura
mercier next picking up the city color
cosmetics eyeshadow trio i'm going to be
picking up this shade here just a matte
burnt orange shade and i'm going to pop
that into the outer V so good way is to
like figure out how to wing out your
eyeshadow is kind of imagine a line from
your lower lash
going just straight out to the tail of
your brow that gives you a really good
guideline and make sure that both sides
are going to be straight so I'm going to
be going into the lorac Pro palette I'm
going to use the color taupe just a
really light neutral brown and that's
just going to act as a really light
guide for us so that we could go in with
darker colors and emphasize the shape
picking up taupe on a flat brush and I'm
going to pack that on the outer V I'm
just roughly creating the shape that we
need for this eye look - doesn't have to
be perfect because then we're going to
blend it all out so once I kind of have
that shape I'm just going to take a
blending brush Mac 217 and kind of go
for those edges next we want to kind of
emphasize that outer V a little bit more
so I'll be taking sable and a tiny bit
of expresso together just to get color
just kind of in-between those two going
to be using a shader brush put it in the
lower lashline so I have a guide and
then take it up to the outer V we have
an applied concealer and foundation
which will really try the look in
together later on this outer part
tapping it in first then whatever's left
over I just kind of flick outwards with
the lightest hand
then go back in with a blending brush
and blend out those edges again so we
want to keep this look really soft
overall her eyes looked like a cloud of
smoke so I want to keep them really soft
but just adding a little bit more depth
as we go once you blend it out it
softens it all up again for Kylie's look
the makeup artist makeup by Arielle
actually used a hello flawless by
benefit so I'm going to use that too
because I have it and this is in the
shade of beige I can't finish off the
eyes without doing my foundation and
concealer I just feel weird so I'm
skipping around a bit the makeup artist
also use the NARS creamy concealer this
is in the shade ginger
using this Sigma tapered kabuki brush we
got to go under the eye here so I can
lightly blend it around the shadow and
not get it in the shadow see how much
concealer just cleans up the eyeshadow
look now you can kind of see the shape a
little bit better - all right so I'm
going to set my under eyes with Laura
Mercier translucent powder so next I'm
going to go into the waterline with the
balm cosmetics mr. right now
bronze pencil I like pencils like this
because you don't have to sharpen them
they just roll up and then next I'm
taking the Hikari cosmetics Korean
metallic pigment shadow in minks brown
shade and this is a long-lasting pigment
I'm just going to take an angled brush
and apply this on the outer lower lash
line going back into sable which is this
color here from the lorac Pro palette
I'm going to mix that with expresso and
deep and out yet lower lash line looking
back at Kylie's pictures I noticed that
her lid was a little bit peachy not
super peachy but just slightly I'm gonna
be going into this color here this is
from the Kat Von D shade and light
palette it's a matte shade and I'm just
going to pack that on to the lid after I
pack that on I'm just going to take my
blending brush and fuse all the colors
together next I'm going to be using the
salon perfect brow pomade it's just
going to define and sculpt the brows
give me a stronger brow and this is in
dark brown Kylie had super strong brows
so I'm going to try to build my brow up
really strong - just to darken it up a
little bit more I'm going to be using
the brow definer by honest Aussie
Beverly Hills and the shade evany this
is a little bit darker than the pomade
we laid down so it's going to just
deepen up the brows go to difference
like having brows on makes this eye and
this bold a sigh over here total like
fierceness on this side and like just
not on the others just to highlight the
inner corner of my eye I'll be using the
Mars mineral eye shadow and your toast
and to apply that I'll be using the
Bokashi smudge brush this is a really
good blending brush
next I'm going to apply my mascara this
is the Tarte lights camera flashes
doesn't look like Kylie's wearing false
lashes and her photos but if I don't
wear false lashes it just looks like I
have no lashes at all so I'm going to be
putting on some eyelashes for lashes I'm
going to go with some that are kind of
natural looking so that it doesn't ruin
the softness of the look these are red
cherry number forty-three lashes and
they look like this
and I pretty much cut them in half to
kind of just put them on the outer
corner so now that we have those lashes
on to make them blend with my natural
lashes I'm going to apply a light coat
of mascara so I have a nail appointment
right now I thought it was gonna be done
filming before my nail appointment which
is at 12:00 and it is currently what
time Stephen 1150 so I am going to
finish the rest of this makeup tutorial
so if you notice my nails being
different that is why these are my nails
currently this one's looking a little
sad so these are my nails now now my
nails are new so I just got back from
the nail salon two seconds ago for you
guys but a while ago for me I went to
get my nails done then I want to eat
some tacos so now I feel good in the
photo of Kylie that I saw she had a
super bronzed face to go with her bronzy
smoked eyes so today I'll be using the
makeup forever pro a fusion and I'm
going to start on my forehead seeing a
the shade and light brush from Kat Von D
to apply this I'm just pushing it into
the skin into the hairline the mobility
of my arms with this dress is literally
up there you go I can't move my arm
there's no stretch it's it's just so
tight on me so this bronzer is a little
bit more subtle so what I'm doing with
this is first kind of warming up the
whole face tanning up the complexion and
then I'm going to go in with a darker
bronzer to pinpoint a little bit more
so now I'm taking my Too Faced chocolate
bronzer in deep tan and I'm applying
that in the hollows of my face for blush
it doesn't seem like she has too much of
a bright blush it seems more bronzy so
I'm gonna go in light with the L'Orange
honest Aussie Beverly Hills illuminator
it's just a matte orange and I'm using a
Mac 137 so that I get a really light
application I forgot to contour my nose
I'm just going to use a Mac 217 and my
Studio Fix Mac in NC 45 and just
contouring the tip to refine it a little
bit nothing too crazy for the lips I
don't have the colors make up by arielle
used but I'm going to improvise so I'm
going to line them first with boldly
bare by Mac and then I'm going to fill
them in with naturally transformed
lipstick also by Mac and just because
this is a little bit more matte and the
lipstick that he used I think had a
little bit more of a sheen to it I'm
just going to lightly apply the a BH lip
gloss and this is in the shade gilded
which is really really gold in the
packaging but on the lips it looks
really really nice for a highlight Kylie
didn't seem to have too much of like a
highlight at least not what I saw I said
I'm just going to lightly dust mary-lou
manizer by the balm all over the face
with the same Mac 137 just to give a
little bronzy glow and I saw like a
little bit of a sheen on her forehead
here the high points of the eyebrows and
along the cheekbones then of course I'm
just going to give my face a spritz to
set all the powders and this is the mac
fix+
before I do my slim Oh sexy headshots
and wipe off my head like I'd be buggin
with this using these skinned Iceland
face wipes to clean this all up it's
nice because you don't need water just
removes everything I'm just going to
moisturize my hands this is also a
product that I got in my Ipsy bag it's
the Peter Louis spa sensual intensive
repair hand comb it smells like hand
remove so that's it for this tutorial I
really hope that you guys enjoyed the
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up if you liked it and I'll see you guys
in my next tutorial okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
