for today's video I'm actually gonna be
doing a makeup look that is inspired by
Kim Kardashian I have absolutely no Kim
Kardashian makeup looks on my channel
which i think is kind of weird cuz
everybody does I mean her makeup is
always really really beautiful I love
her makeup I saw this look on makeup by
Mario's Page he's one of her makeup
artists so the inspo pick for this is
right over here she just has a really
really a sultry look I love it on her so
if you guys want to learn how to get
this makeup look then keep on watching
alright guys so for today's tutorial I'm
starting off with my face first just
because I don't know I felt like it I
was feeling a little pale I guess I'm
using my Mac Studio Fix fluid and NC 40
stippling that all over my face with a
zoeva powder brush and then I'm gonna
apply my NARS creamy concealer under the
eyes in somewhat of a triangle shape I
don't really know what I was going for
there it's half way triangle I guess and
then I'm gonna highlight the rest of my
face using my Mac mineralized concealer
I'm gonna go ahead and spray my Urban
Decay all nighter spray onto my brush
just because I feel like this method
helps blend it in nice nice layer nicer
and it also really helps set my under
eye concealer so that it isn't crease
want to make sure to stop that concealer
right away so doesn't get all Creasy and
I'm using my Tarte loose powder for this
and of course Kim Kardashian is always
known to have a really nice bronzy look
and a pretty fierce contour so I'm gonna
first warm up the skin per usual with my
Mac give me Sun and I'm just gonna apply
that along the perimeter of my face and
along my jawline and cheekbones so go
into a deeper contour next and this is
from a Monica dark palette and I'm just
gonna really deepen up those cheekbones
Kim Kardashian has naturally amazing
cheekbones but we could always fake it a
little bit more with some contour powder
and of course she always has her nose
contoured so we're gonna go ahead and do
that also I'm using a thin contour
powder and I'm just using my Mac 2
and keen brush for this now picking up
this really light colored powder if the
amount of Kedar powder in situ and I'm
just gonna highlight the bridge of my
nose and my brow bone with this powder
as well so we're gonna go ahead and prep
our eyes for the eyeshadow I'm using my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot as usual
because you guys know this is my
favorite eyeshadow base and I'm buffing
that in with as the wave a concealer
brush next I'm going into the tartlet
palette just to pick up this nice warm
caramel e Brown this is just gonna be
our transition shade you guys can use
any light brown eyeshadow that you have
handy just so that all the colors blend
really nicely all together and I'm
buffing that in with my zoeva for m-44
one brush next I'm going into the
Anasazi a Beverly Hills shadow and this
is the color red earth
I noticed that Kim Kardashian had a
really warm reddish brown tone on the
outer corner of the eye so we're just
gonna concentrate this just on the outer
portion again I'm using the same morphe
brush
Kim K had a beautiful gold shade on her
lid so I thought this one would be
perfect it's for makeup geek it's their
new foiled eyeshadow in the shade magic
act and I'm just gonna pack that all
over the lid with a flat shader brush
pretty standard so to really bring the
drama to this look I'm gonna mix a dark
brown shadow and a black eyeshadow from
the tartlet palette and I'm just gonna
really define the outer V of the eye
Kim's look had a lot of drama on that
outer portion of the eye so I'm just
gonna continue to pack these colors on
until it's as deep as I want it to be
and feel free to use any black or dark
brown eyeshadows that you guys have this
is just what I had on hand but I will
definitely list every eye shadow color
that I used in the description box down
below so now you just want to pick up a
black gel liner this one is from Tarte
and I'm using a zoeva liner brush to
line my waterline and after that I'm
gonna take a small shader brush with
some black eyeshadow and just smoke out
that lower lash line you guys can get a
smoky as you want
Kym's was very smoky and I'm just
blending it out so it's not so harsh
with a clean blending brush
well semi clean it has a little bit of
eyeshadow on it and I just decided to
pack on a little bit more black on the
outer beep because once I did the lower
lash line I realized that the outer V
needs to be just a little bit darker I'm
going to take a little bit of gel liner
and just lightly line my eyes she
doesn't have a parent like a strong wing
or anything so I'm just gonna lightly
elongate my eyes with a skinny wing you
guys know that's difficult for me I'm
always used to doing really thick wings
but just a little flick little kitten
flick and of course you want to curl
your lashes Kim Kardashian it's all
about the lashes apply a little bit of
mascara this is just from Tarte it's the
lights camera lashes and I'm going to
use these ardell lashes right here and
pop them on Kim always has really
fluttery lashes that look kind of
natural but not really so these ones are
perfect and to give my eyes a more lashy
look I'm applying a few individuals
the bottom lashes here and these are by
red cherry now time to highlight I'm
using my favorite highlighter at the
moment which is my mary-lou manizer by
the balm on the bridge of my nose my
Cupid's bow and of course on the high
points of my cheekbones here to really
highlight those areas and give us a
sharper bone structure and I'm also
going to top a little bit of that on the
inner corners of my eyes and also take a
little bit of that onto the brow bone
and for blush I'm taking a nice peachy
pink shade and applying that to the
apples of my cheeks for the lips Kim's
were super effortless and they just had
a nice gloss so I'm going to use this
one by Velvet 59 and this is the Velvet
Rose lip gloss in noisette and it just
smells like roses it's amazing so the
lips are very simple and you just want
to apply a ton of that lip gloss and
this is the finished makeup look thank

hope you enjoyed this tutorial

suggestions as always I tell you guys

will see you guys in my next tutorial
