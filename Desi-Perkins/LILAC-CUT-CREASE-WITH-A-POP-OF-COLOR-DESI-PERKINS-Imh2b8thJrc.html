today's video is going to be a makeup
tutorial on this Bobby
lilac II makeup look is what I think I'm
going to call it I want to do something
totally different but I don't know what
happened honestly thing just this is
what came out sometimes you sit down you
have this inspiration in mind and then
somewhere along the way plans change and
I love how it came out I love all the
tones tied together this list really
ties everything together it's my first
time wearing this color in particular
and it's poorly out of my comfort zone I
love the gray mauve undertone that it
has so if you guys are interested on how
to get soso makeup look then keep on
watching the first thing I'm going to do
is go into the violet Voss Pro matte
about youth palette and I think I'm
going to take the shade smitten a little
bit you know I'm going to go into that
shade first with my Smith to 3/5 brush
and I've already applied a base and set
the base on my lid I'm just tilting my
head back and we're going to go in and
create the shape first just lightly
mapping out the shape the round of hot
over here and this is going to be our
transition shade and we'll bring it in
all the way over here and I'm just also
applying this to the outer V area over
here too next I'm going to go in with
the shade darling which is this dark
brown y'all I mean the same brush
because I'm gonna finish of course I'm
starting the product on the outer corner
first and I'm just going to bring it in
I'm taking it into the inner corner here
so I'm just going to keep deepening that
grease up until I'm happy with the
darkness of it taking a little bit of
Smin on a clean brush and I'm just going
to run over those edges to see once you
run smitten over everything again the
transition shade it just makes
everything look nice and smooth and
blended we just want this really nice
soft crease pretty simple standard soft
crease going on here
next I'm picking up Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot here taking that on a little flat
concealer brush or I do with this is
carve out the
did so that we have a nice sharp crease
just took a little bit of that just
apply not all over the lid kind of just
blend out these edges here alright so
now that way you have a nice clean lip
space I'm going to take Matt love which
is this shader out of a heel on a flat
brush and I'm going to apply this on the
outer V of the eye stick that right over
here I'm going to go Eva luxe smokey
shader brush just cannot apply that to
the outer V let me too much into the
dose of colors pencil brush here just I
could really smoke along those edges so
you want to pass it on on the outer
corner once you get to the center here
we're just going to lightly blend it so
just kind of dust it in this way I'm
actually going to take just a bone color
from the palette and pack it over here
as well pretty much the same tone as
eyeshadow base there still wanted to be
all creamy over here taking a little bit
of dose of colors pigment is a new shell
and I'm going to press that into the
center of the lid it could be a mistake
but we're going to go for it anyways I'm
going to give a nice little glossy Sheen
of course you want to blend out those
edges too so once you pack it all on and
everything is pretty much off of the
brush and onto your lineage just kind of
wiggle around the edges so that it
blends into the inner corner and the
outer shell segment is popping all right
so now I'm picking up my favorite
eyeliner this is the Bobbi Brown golden
bronze sparkle we're just going to wing
it out with this I love this liquid
liner because so easy to use now I'm
going to be picking up color pops liner
and this is in my baby or I put that in
the waterline and I'm going to put a
little concealer on I haven't done my
foundation yet but simpler zoomed in
already I'm just going to put a little
bit of concealer on so I could smoke out
the lower lash line real quick so I just
used a little bit of Maya Becca luminous
concealer in medium just to lay down a
base next I'm picking up from Miss cuit
and this is from the melt cosmetics
stack tool of 6 X and I'm going to run
that all on the lower lash line and I'm
using the dose of colors pencil brush
where I keep building up this color and
number
lash line I'm going to pick up the
mary-lou manizer by the balm cosmetics
it's the highlight but I like to use
this as the inner corner highlight on my
eyes
alright so to finish off the look I'm
going to use a little mascara this is
the Maybelline one it's a colossal Big
Shot mascara I'm going to apply that to
top and bottom and then it all needs a
pretty crusty but still wearable Queen B
lashes on the outer corners of the eyes
so we'll go ahead and do that and be
right back we're foundation I'm going to
be using the Urban Decay Naked skin and
this is in the shade medium I'm just
applying that all over with my Beauty
Blender her usual what a difference
putting on foundation makes if you like
I don't know I just like it just brings
everything together like foundation and
concealer brightens up your face makes
everything look clean and if you ever
have it when you're applying your
foundation and you just feel like the
tiniest piece of lint somewhere on your
face but you can't see it and you're
trying to get it off and you think you
get it and it's just like this constant
tickle I hate when that happens it's
happening to me right now and I feel it
around my nose but I don't see it
I figure with lip color I should do with
this look right now it's obviously out
of gravitate towards nude wondering
there would be something that was a cool
that's not nude I know you guys would
expect me to do nude and that's what I
would expect to do but I'm trying to
change it up and do something else
we'll see I'm going to pick up my RCM a
powder and set the under eyes since we
haven't done my I'm using my morphe e27
brush to lightly sweep that under the
eyes and then I break down the sides of
the nose and onto the apples of the
cheeks here so a lot more power than I
intended there we go mm-hmm we search
along those areas of my face I feel like
I need to add a little bit more of that
inner corner highlight of my eyes like
it kind of disappeared a little I'm just
going to shave a little bit of more of
that mary-lou manizer and top it back
into the inner corners while I'm
deciding the lip color I guess I'll just
start highlighting the rest of my face
so I'm also going to put a little bit of
that mary-lou manizer down the bridge of
my nose here come on the trip
keep it so my dog got me right now you
got it has me I'm just like trying to
like be you know myself and on camera
but sometimes the dog gets you gets the
best of you and you just feel so
sluggish and sleepy I've been like out
of it all day actually today I was on
the phone with Katie and it was so funny
because for a while she was sending me a
lot of voice messages and so I was
listening to the voice messages back to
back to back and then she was like
actually you know what there's too many
voice messages let me just call you so
then she called me and I'm on the phone
with her and she's telling me this long
story and then all of a sudden she
finishes telling me the story and I just
stay quiet like I say nothing I'm just
sitting here like staring listening but
not saying anything and it got really
silent and she was like hello I forgot
that I was on the phone with her like I
thought I was listening to her voice
messages and she was like are you even
there I'm just like no wrong staring at
the wall right now like I don't know
what's happening to me I'm so tired it
was funny because it was a story where
it like demanded a reaction and I just
didn't say anything because I was so out
of it that's for sure let's go ahead and
highlight the cheekbone I used to use
this highlighter every day all day so
mary loumanizer excused to be my jam
crystal loved it so much
classic highlight I'm going to save a
little bit of Kat Von D under-eye
brightening powder this is in golden and
I'm going to take the tiniest amount of
it is put on the under eyes to brighten
it up just a little bit more on the
cheeks so anyways just to catch up with
you guys
we're meeting Katie and John in New York
where we are going to be presenting for
the Shorty Awards Katie and I are
presenting an award and we're also
nominated
I think we're basically nominated for
best couple is what I think so
so then we'll be there for the Shorty
Awards I'm so excited for that too
because I don't know Katie nice first
time presenting anything it's just going
to be fun it's going to be a lot of fun
it's going to be crazy we're going to
jump into hula because I've been really
really with a heavy these days I
stopped using that give me son I don't
know if you guys have noticed I was
breaking out a lot right here on the
phone
my cheeks and my ass addition was like
it must be whatever you're putting on
that area and I was like no no no Matt
give me some would never do that to me
you know I mean like we've been together
for so long I was like well maybe my
particular bronzer was like too old so I
was like let me buy a new one so I could
just maybe it's like contaminated or I
don't know let's just start fresh right
it's a new market me son I was like my
go to plan nope I still started breaking
out they're all or I put my bronzer and
so I was like alright I'm just going to
stop using give me some for a while see
what happened and lo and behold I'm not
getting those like little bumps I mean I
still break out from regular breakouts
but these were like bumps like all along
this area a lots and lots of bumps so I
don't know why that would be happening I
don't know if the formula changed which
I don't think it did because the one
that I was even using was pretty old and
then I bought a new one it was still
happening so I don't really know what
happened that's where right I'm still
not 100% sure I don't want to believe it
as of right now I haven't been using it
and I haven't been getting those bump
what is erisa expert opinions on this
matter
tragic matter Katie's never been to
Coachella Katie and I are just going
solo dolo sometimes you just kind of
need a girls trip
we are going to go and be strong
independent women and I'm sure 5 minutes
in we're going to be like oh shoot we
have to save our own tips we have no one
to hang out with except ourselves we're
going to be missing the boys if I'm
going to try moon this has like more of
those Mavi undertones like cool slightly
purple and then I'm also going to use
the lip liner with that it seems like
kind of cheating because it's like nude
but it's not really it's more bobby
light purple and then I'm going to try
the liquid lipstick I've actually never
worn this shade this is the color I
think it looks really good with the
colors on the eyes
alright so this is it this is the
finished makeup look it's very mommy
lilac II I ended up really loving this
lip I'm happy that I tried something
different I would never have picked up a
shade like this but now when it's dry I
actually really love the way it looks so
pleasantly surprised for that new fine
for me you know usually I would go with
like
normal nude but I tried something
different today for you guys so I hope
