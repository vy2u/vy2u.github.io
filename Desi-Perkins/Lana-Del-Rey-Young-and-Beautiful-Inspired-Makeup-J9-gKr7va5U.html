weather and hot cocoa Lana Del Rey's
young and beautiful video displayed the
perfect easy fall look that any girl can
achieve and where here is my rendition
of it and if you like what you see just
keep on watching start off by priming
your face with a face primer just to get
that perfect finish that Lana always has
go in with your favorite foundation or
one that has really nice coverage I'm
using Mac studio fluid because it just
covers everything and Mona always has
that full coverage look
I'm using a Tarte cosmetics dual face
brush for this just above everything in
then I'm taking a cream shadow in the
color brown sugar and I'm just applying
that to the outer portion of my lids now
of course Lana has really round eyes and
the shape that she rocks in this look is
round but my eyes are very almond so I'm
going to try to get them as round as
possible
after you apply that cream base just
take a blending brush and blend out
those edges
now I'm going in with Mac's cream shadow
in the color shell this is going to give
us that wet appearance that Lana has in
the video but of course for an everyday
girl gloss is just not a good look if it
creases so this is the alternative I'm
going to go in with makeup geeks
afterglow loose pigment and this is just
going on the center of the lid so that
it gives us a little bit more shimmer
when the light hits take a fluffy brush
and of course blend out those edges as
well
you
I'm taking this deep wine color from the
anastacio palette and I'm going to pop
that on the outer portions of my lid and
then just blend it in to the crease this
is always easier if you start with a
little bit of product and then slowly
build your way up
now pick up a frosty champagne color and
take that with a pencil brush and just
highlight the inner tear ducts of your
eyes to just give your eyes a more open
appearance this is Mac Blanc type it's
just a matte balm color and I'm taking
that and just highlighting my brow bone
now Lana has brown liner which is a
really nice alternative if you want a
softer look which is what we're going
for here so I'm using Mac dip down into
the liner brush and I'm just doing a
very simple line across the lid and no
wing for this look we're keeping it
really simple and easy
go ahead and give your lashes a really
good curl
add your favorite mascara now I actually
got two pairs of lashes stuck them
together and cut them to make them outer
corner lashes but if you already have
outer corner lashes just go ahead and
use those I'm taking the same wine color
and running that under my lash line and
then just blending it out with a fluffy
brush take a white liner and line your
waterline to give your eyes in even more
open appearance kind of gives you that
doe-eyed all up now take your concealer
and conceal those under eyes I'm taking
Bobbi Brown's foundation stick in the
color almond to carve out my cheekbones
like Lana has in the video and to really
warm up my face she's not wearing any
blush in the video that I can tell so
the contour is to stand out in this look
you
now I'm using Illamasqua gleam in the
color Aurora to really highlight the
cheekbones you want to give yourself
that healthy dewy skin look especially
in the fall when our skin tends to be a
little bit more dry
now pick up a powder that's a few shades
lighter than your skin tone and set your
under-eye and the center of your face
tick mode its liner in the color
raspberry and just map out the shape of
your lip you really want to do this when
going for a bold lip just so you get
that perfect finish now I'm taking two
lipsticks moded snotty and this is wet
and wild
smoking hot pink to get that perfect
lana color that she has in the video
make sure you blot your lipstick because
that helps it stay on a lot longer
now your look is complete I hope you
