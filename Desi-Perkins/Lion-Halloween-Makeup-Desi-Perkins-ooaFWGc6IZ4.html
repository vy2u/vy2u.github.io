today's tutorial is going to be on this
sexy lion I wore this last year to a
Halloween party and you guys all wanted
a tutorial on it
if the Halloween party was like the day
before Halloween so I never got around
to filming it last year so since it was
so highly requested I'm filming it this
year and hopefully you guys recreate it
and love the video so if you're
interested in getting this lion look
then keep on watching prior to filming I
use this hey honey
come clean facial scrub this is good
because it's going to eliminate any pore
clogging we're going to be putting a lot
of makeup on so it's good to prep your
skin beforehand first I'm going to
hydrate my skin using the nourish
organic argan face serum I'm just going
to take a few drops of this and add it
all over next I'm going to go in and
prime my face this is the makeup forever
smoothing primer next I'm going to go in
with my foundation I'm going to be
mixing my Make Up For Ever HD foundation
with my L'Oreal infallible foundation I
just want to mix them because I want the
fullest coverage possible
and while that settles I'm going to be
doing my eyebrows first I'm going to go
in with the Anasazi at Beverly Hills
clear brow gel to tame my brow hairs
they are looking hairy
so for brows I'm going to go in with the
touch and soul brow pencil this is in
the shade mink wink and it's the super
proof brow gel I'm going to go ahead and
highlight my brow bone and clean up the
brow area using a concealer this is
motives cosmetics and amber I'm going to
prime my eyelids for my eye shadow and
I'm going to be using the smashbox
24-hour photo finish shadow primer to
apply this i'm going to be using a
synthetic brush and this is medium eyes
shader by royal and langnickel i'm going
to go into a bone colored eyeshadow this
one is called long bio Nastasia beverly
hills and I'm just going to use the same
brush and pack that on the brow bone
into the crease this is going to set the
primer and help us blend all the powders
on top of it I want a really nice opaque
brow bone highlight to
so now I'm going to start by cutting my
crease and the color I'm going to be
using before that is Sienna you want to
pick up a little bit of Sienna on your
brush just gonna give myself the initial
shape curve the brush as if you're
following the shape of an eyeliner and
up pick up a little bit of orange soda
from Anasazi Beverly Hills and use that
to blend the edges once we have the
shape that we're going for we're going
to go in with a small detail brush this
one's by zueva and I'm going to pick up
this deep brown color and I'm going to
cut the crease even more take an angled
brush dip it in the same Brown I'll just
outline the shape can you go back in
with the detail brush and blend it out a
little bit okay so I know my crease is
pretty cut at this point but I'm going
to take a little bit of black and just
at the bottom of the brown deepen it up
especially on the outer part of the eye
okay so now I'm going to just clean up
the edges with this concealer this is
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer this
is in the shade tan golden I'm taking
that on a flat synthetic brush and I'm
just going to go right below the wing
feather it out
so I'm not really too sure what lid
color I used last year but you could use
any gold eyeshadow I feel like gold is a
good way to go this is the Armani eyes
to kill and number five
so I'm lightly you're going to apply
that over my lid and then I'm going to
take a little bit of the mica beauty
cream eyeshadow in the shade bronze and
use that in the inner corner here and
this is a long wear eyeshadow so you
could even use this as a base for the
lid as well I'm gonna go over my lip
color a little bit with that gold I
showed you guys earlier which is this
one right here cuz I want it to be
slightly lighter especially in the
center next we're gonna do the liner and
I'm gonna be using NYX gel liner and the
same angled brush I was using for the
crease which is the zoeva winged liner
brush with this wing I'm gonna be
starting it on the outer part so that I
could follow this line that I made here
put on some false lashes these are
starlet by house of lashes I'm going to
go ahead and apply my concealer now I'm
using the Naked concealer by Urban Decay
but you kind of want like really high
looking cheekbones so I'm just going
kind of crazy with the concealer also
going to highlight here and the chin now
of course take your V blender and you
just want to blend all that concealer
out you want really extreme highlight
and contours with this look to mimic the
shape of a lion
when I turn the sponge around and blend
out the line here
I look like a lion already blend it out
not all the way because you still want
to keep the outline
I'm taking my laura mercier setting
powder and applying that right over the
concealer on the upper lip I'm also
gonna set the under eyes with this
tweeze the Beautyblender pretty tight so
I can get like a nice line and also set
the concealer on my nose taking my Mac
Studio Fix powder foundation this isn't
seasick first I apply it on the contours
of my face and then I do a light sweep
of it over my entire face alright so
after the powder we're going to contour
it's very important to contour I'm going
in with the UH Nastasia contour kit
taking these two deeper colors okay so
this is a really strong contour that's
okay
what I like about Halloween costumes
like being a lion is that you can have
so much contour and it's fine because
you're a lion you can do whatever you
want going back in with my Beauty
Blender I'm just gonna kind of go over
that with whatever foundation is left
over to blend it in next I'm going to
take my Mac gold deposit just going to
go ahead and sweep this all over
next I'm going to go in with the
highlighter this is Laura Geller gilded
honey
and you could also go crazy with your
highlighter alright so now I'm going to
go into my blush this is Mac peachy-keen
and apply that and make this face so
what we're going to do is line the inner
waterline and a little bit of the lower
lash line with an white eyeliner and
then when you get to the inner corner
just kind of angle the brush down and do
a little point now that we've added the
white we're going to pick up a black
eyeshadow with an angled brush and line
right under the white that we put down
you want to make sure to set the white
with white eyeshadow as well so that it
stays I picked up Sienna again and
blended it out and then I'm also going
to take on my small detailed brush the
Sienna color and shade under the white
in the inner corner now to set and
brighten up the inner corner highlight
of my eye I'm going to be using the
lightest gold in the measurable
difference palette so you want to make
sure to tight line your upper lash line
so that it's as dark as possible I'm
using the Coastal Scents Express line
this is good for the inner waterline
areas because it glides on pretty smooth
so I'm going to go into the makeup
forever flash palette you guys could use
a eyeliner gel liner pencil liner to do
this I'm just going to get the black go
around the nostrils then dip down at the
tip of the nose
connect the end of the bottom of your
nose down to your lid and then for the
lip so you could either use a black
liquid lipstick but right now all I have
is my gel liner so I'm going to use that
I'm going to take my NYC liquid liner
and just draw a few little dots as
whiskers
okay and then for the bottom lip you
want to use something really nude so I'm
going to be using the naturally
transformed lipstick by Mac I'm gonna
use the liquid lipstick this is meet
Matt Hughes and it's from the balm
cosmetics I'm gonna take a little bit of
this and just apply it on the outer
parts of my lip so for my hair I'm just
going to go ahead and spritz in some
hair care this is the 12 and 1 leave-in
treatment just cause heat protection too
so if you're planning on putting more
curls in your hair alright guys so that
is it for the tutorial thank you guys so
