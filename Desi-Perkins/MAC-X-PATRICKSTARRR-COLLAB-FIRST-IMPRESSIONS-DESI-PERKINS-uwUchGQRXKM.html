today's video I thought that I would
share with you guys the Patrick Starr
and Matt Cosmetics collaboration set
that I got over here I feel like this is
so exciting to see Mac do a
collaboration with somebody this is
their first influencer collaboration and
I feel like Patrick was perfect for it
so from what I see he's rolling out with
multiple like launches with Mac and this
is the first here this is like the
little guide that Mac sends over with PR
packages very Patrick Starr very sparkly
look at this boom and then here we have
all the information on all the products
that I will be sharing with you guys and
I'll also be trying the products on for
you and swatching and like that so
let's go ahead and get started and show
you guys the PR box because I think it's
so pretty oh this is the pr box very
sparkly I wouldn't expect anything less
than sparkly okay so we have two
eyeshadow quads three lip glosses three
lipsticks setting powder that I'm really
excited about and three lip liners down
there at the bottom show you guys first
off the two eyeshadow quads you guys did
not know about this collection with
Patrick Starr it has its own cute
packaging that is unique to Patrick
Starr however the eyeshadows inside our
existing Mac shadows and I believe these
are some of his favorites that he put
together in two little palettes here
except there is one in this palette
called oh my god that is new I'm gonna
go ahead and start off with goal getter
this is the goal getter quad we have
four eyeshadows here the first one being
soft brown really nice transition shade
we have amber lights used to be one of
my favorite eyeshadows it's
beautiful gold you can really just put
this all over your lid buff it out and
it looks really pretty
Swiss chocolate and that's this one
right over here and then this burgundy
shade which is called
I'm into it these are the four swatches
for the goal gutter quad soft brown
amber lights Swiss chocolate and I'm
into it now we're gonna move on to the
glam AF squad first we have a brulee
which is this color right here this is a
really good brow bone highlight inner
corner highlight really liked that one
this one is oh my god and then we have
saddle saddle used to be my jam and
embark I mean if there's somebody out
there who loves mac cosmetics who didn't
use embark with every look when
Instagram started like show me because
embark was like the most popular shade
along with like brown script those two
were just everything to me personally
alright so here we have the swatches for
the glam AF palette rouler oh my god
saddle and embark i swatched these a
little better than the last one
I tried really hard on these so I'm
gonna go ahead and apply amber lights
just like on my lid to show you guys
amber lights is from the goal gutter
quad and it's this gold one that I was
talking to you guys about I feel like I
haven't filmed a makeup tutorial and so
long because I've been gone for like a
month
what's another Mac favorite for sure
embark and brown script there was like
was it Tanya birdies to use it all was a
wood winked oh I love wood winked yeah
that's the color a spiked brow pencil
was my um studio fluid foundation
fix plus has always been in my life we
have a lasting love story any time I
want to do my makeup just really fast
what I like to do is put the eyeshadow
all over the lid and then take a clean
blending brush and just kind of blend
the edges so I'm gonna be filming a
tutorial for this hair right now it's
looking a little end of the day didn't
look as magical as it did yesterday but
I'm doing a tutorial for that
that so look out for that let's go into
saddle from the glam AF just kind of run
that through the crease just to define
it like a little bit more do you guys
have any holiday plans going on any
parties any themed parties any fun
makeup look so you guys want me to do I
don't even know what to film anymore
these days I want to keep doing a lot of
tutorials but I just need like look
ideas all the time you know go for the
brow bone I'm gonna use brulee only put
the brow bone highlight right in the
highest point of your brow bone ought to
like take it all the way around because
then it'll drag your eye down if you put
it anywhere else let's go ahead and do a
little concealer under the eye so I can
show you guys the setting powder because
the setting powder to me is like the
most exciting product it was the one
thing that the moment I saw the pictures
of what he was coming out with I was
like give me that powder I mean he's
just my Becca concealer and then maybe
like mix it with a little shape tape I
got so sick the other day I haven't
really gotten that sick in a while now
you know like right when you're sick
your face just feels and looks tired and
you feel like dry and just shriveled
that's kind of how I'm feeling I'm
shriveled murky I'm shriveling my lips
are peeling like you would not believe
honestly my face is repelling makeup I'm
just being honest with you guys I looked
like etu when he was like all right I'm
gonna go ahead and blend that out this
is a elsie cosmetic sponge at first I
was like oh this is like too big for me
but now I'm like I like it I think I'm
gonna use tan sand so I have like a
darkness here so I like to put a little
bit of a warmer concealer there what
else is new okay well of my aunt media
yet the NA on Instagram okay
she has entered the social-media world
if you guys don't know her guys don't
watch my snaps she is just the lid of my
life
she was my great-aunt and she is so
hilarious I just don't know where she
gets it the other day she asked this
woman oh you have two boys and like she
has two kids and she's like yeah one is
like sixteen and ones like 27 and she
goes the 27 year old could be for me and
I was like no filter no chill think Hyo
Lee glows actually gonna come give her a
facial I'm like oh it's like that no
okay
here she is this is the set powder the
one product that I myself feel the most
excited for I've actually already tried
it I'm gonna try to get on camera for
you guys colorless ultrafine with a
matte finish and goes for $34 it comes
with a sifter but I take the sifters out
of my translucent powders with my
tweezers because I like to dip beauty
blenders in there it says colorless but
you know how like a Laura Mercier
translucent powder is a little bit more
like yellow this goes a little bit more
towards the light pink as much as I pack
this on it doesn't feel heavy or like
I'm packing on a lot of product it's
unlike any other translucent powder that
I have personally used I did notice this
will give you a really really bright
under-eye like really bright so just be
mindful of that I tried it two ways I
did this and I packed it on really heavy
and today I actually just dusted it on
with a brush and I felt like I liked
that method better for me it's set and
looked really good under my eyes the
whole day this has a really natural
finish as far as like the texture goes
just melt into your skin I'm gonna go
ahead and dust this off let me just
condense my thoughts what I love about
this powder is that it looks like skin
it has a really nice finished so finely
milled I honestly have not tried a
translucent powder that
this fine and I liked that for a no
makeup look I feel like I could use this
under my eyes like dust it and it's
still untraceable so that's the powder
I'm just gonna go back in with saddle on
my lower lash line so I don't look
greicy I'm gonna use my little dose of
colors pencil brush a light little
dusting here I wonder how hard it was to
do a setting powder I imagine it's
really difficult to do any type of
setting powders foundations concealers
wait this is oh my god right here I
think I'm just gonna pop this in the
inner corner for the updates I just lit
that every time I apply this part
of my makeup I just think of Steven cuz
his favorite thing about my makeup is
the inner corner highlight he says it
does something for him let me put on a
little mascara and then we'll be back
next in the collection we have three lip
liners here we have mahogany we have
brick and we have edge to edge so edge
to edge is like a Mavi tone brick is a
really nice wine tone and then mahogany
is you know that's just mahogany : I'm
just gonna swatch them for you this is
brick alright there is mahogany and this
is an intense reddish brown and lastly
you have edge to edge and this is like a
mid-tone dirty blue pink then we have
these three lipsticks the really pretty
Patrick Starr limited edition packaging
here this color is mama Starr I think
that's so sweet he named it after his
mama I love that she's really cute did I
get it on myself oh my god do I still
have cheeto fingers I think I do I'm so
nasty I cannot get it off I'm gonna
apply this mama Starr color for you guys
no lip liner
it's actually nice not applying a liquid
lip right now because my lips could not
handle it so this is a mama star pigment
incredible Max lipsticks are really nice
and creamy have that really good smell
to
like cookies or something and it's a
satin finish lipstick I really like it
the next color we have is she better
work girl
so this is one of their matte finishes
here this is gonna look really really
good with my sweater right now I know
how long have I worn has it been since
I've used to wear pink lipsticks all the
time I like this I had to work at one
time for you Patrick lastly for the
lipsticks we have Patrick woo
how crazy is it to have a Wu lipstick
for yourself Patrick you know RiRi woo
Rihanna had really Ruth so this is a
pretty iconic lipstick Ruby woo line
with Mac this is also a matte finish
lipstick Ruby moves also one of my
favorite red lipsticks when I think back
to like my Mac favorites I love how
these apply so nice once I get my lip
lines straight then I feel like I could
fill it in I love this red and I feel
like it's just one of my faves this is
definitely like on my list of things
that I would pick up from this
collection yeah let's do a little okay
and there is also three matching lip
glosses which you could wear on top of
lipsticks or you could wear them by
themselves this one look how pigmented
you see this is like a gloss that you
could just wear by itself without the
lipstick since we have Patrick Wu on
right now let's try this right on top oh
this is sexual holy moly
this is so pretty I love it
I love it hello yeah I love it mm-hmm
describes this one which is Patrick Wu
as an intense bluish red blueish Reds is
what makes your teeth extra white I love
blueish Reds and then we have she better
work
this is a light warm pink and then we
have mama star which is a pink cinnamon
color all right I'm gonna try the other
lip glosses on by themselves for you
we're gonna swatch mama star
look how pigmented that ish is I fear
that I'm gonna get these swatches on me
somehow oh yes oh yes
you know this year is the year of
glosses I'm telling you the gloss is
back there just like youthful also my
lips can't handle matte lipstick right
now cuz they're about to fall off this
is a really pretty color like almost
like your lip color but better if I do
my mom's watching like why don't you
name something after me from your
collection so that's mama star really
pigmented really pretty I like this is
like an everyday everyday lip gloss when
you're trying on a bunch of lipsticks
this is where having no foundation like
comes into play lastly you better work
here we go one swipe all very true to
color this is like a little too blue
tone for me it scares me a little bit
but I think it would look better for me
this lip gloss on top of the lipstick
that goes with it or with a lip liner
kind of makes me look like I'm cold like
my lips are slightly blue cuz I'm cold
alright guys so that is the whole of
first release from mac cosmetics and
