filming room slash makeup storage area
and I know what you guys are thinking
this is like ridiculous how much makeup
is here and I'm aware I was organizing
my makeup the other day and I noticed
these palettes one NARS palette and then
there's an anglo palette that I have
such big memories with I saved up all my
money and I went to Sephora and I knew I
shouldn't have bought it but after I
felt so great like I just was so excited
to have this NARS blush palette in
particular and when I was organizing my
makeup I found the palette and I looked
up and I saw this like ridiculous makeup
setup I just thought to myself like how
happy and grateful I am of that moment
then and like where I've come now and in
how fortunate I am to have this job with
that being said I thought about that
feeling I had when I have thought this
makeup and I wanted to do a giveaway of
makeup for you guys I just want to make
it easy and fun I'm gonna put a link to
a Google document in the description box
of this video and all you have to do is
fill that out I'm just gonna pick ten
winners and send out some makeup to you
guys so here is an overview of my makeup
storage this whole portion of the
storage system is from Ikea
it's actually an entertainment center so
you know you put a TV in the middle I
remember being at IKEA and thinking like
I don't want those little drawers I need
more space for bigger items hair
products and things like that and I
thought this would be perfect I didn't
really know how I was gonna make it work
because you know there's a huge gap in
the center but I was like I will figure
it out initially I wanted to put like a
shelf here and then put a vanity here
with lights that kind of set up but I
realized I don't really use a vanity
mirror and I needed more storage than
anything so this is what I came up with
these are from the Container Store
they're meant to be men's shoe holders
and t-shirt holders I saw them and
thought they'd be perfect for makeup I
like this system because I feel like it
can grow as you grow if you get more
makeup or you need more they're
stackable
you can also buy dividers that go into
the drawers and it sections off your
makeup really nicely if you're at home
and you want a nice looking way of
seeing all your makeup I think this is a
really nice alternative these run
depending on the size I will put the
prices of these and also these which are
a little bit larger now I'm just gonna
kind of go into detail on everything
starting from Mejia and then working my
way first we have this side and I really
liked these clear cabinets you can also
choose to not have them clear if you
don't want that but I thought it was
kind of sheshe here's where I store all
of my makeup brushes for example I have
blending brushes in here flat concealer
brushes and I just used a label maker to
put these labels on so that I know where
everything is
I did have clear labels before but if
you use clear labels with these clear
containers you can't see what the label
says I had to like get up really close
like what the hell does that say so in
the first drawer we have some backup
moody blenders just semi clean or no
this one was a little sauce looks very
clean but then we have highlight brushes
you know just for the highlight or the
glue I have some detail brushes in here
just liner brushes basically any brush
that's tiny it's easier to have them all
together we have some spare booty
blenders I kind of keep these spare ones
here because my friends and family come
over and they always want you know
beauty blenders so I have those they're
unopened for them then we have the
blending brushes this is actually in one
of my favorite drawers because blending
brushes make me very happy
and we have some flat concealer brushes
these are like shader brushes concealer
brushes moving on to this one we have
body brushes I'll use these for like
body bronzers because they're too big
for my face this would just be like my
whole face here then I have large face
brushes in here hello
there we go and then in this last drawer
we have the small face brushes so little
blush brushes under eye brushes any tiny
face brushes in there and that pretty
much completes this section I have
nothing up here on this shelf except a
white fig candle that I never light
because you can't light a candle in a
dresser so it's really there just for I
don't know you just gotta have more
bullshit and you make up room I guess
alright so now moving on in here is
where I keep all my face masks I have
one of these containers a lot of people
put lip liners in here but I decided to
put just masks in the top some tatcha
one part ones and then next two we just
have a bunch of sheet masks sk2
charlotte tilbury mask i couldn't use
this one because you guys know I had
that cotton phobia but I do have it here
for when I have my friends over moving
on to the next section here we have body
lotions and shower gels kind of like a
miscellaneous drawer this one smells so
good this is the orb a1 oh it smells
really really nice so Melanie Mills like
body shimmers and this is new bronze
goddess from Estee Lauder which I really
want to try I haven't tried yet starting
off with this side of the pier drawers
these are the larger containers I
believe these are called the t-shirt
containers
I will definitely list everything in the
description box for you guys so you can
find exactly what they are this is just
hot new shit Thank You Katie for that
one I put things that I know I want to
try out or I have ideas for looks with
these items they're new I don't want to
mix them in yet so I keep them all in
there then we have bronzers I love this
drawer and here we just have some NARS
bronzers I love NARS packaging so I
always try to kind of keep it together
do you think it's really pretty
some Becca bronzers hourglass there's
some two-faced back there kela mary lou
manizer I think in here I put all my
shimmery bronzer so anything that's
gonna give you a glow and then we have
more bronzers over here some settling
mats I don't really use that one because
Nicole girls behave as she said you
don't really use Salinas
which is true you want to keep it
pristine and then I have some hoola
bronzer and Charlotte Tilbury bronzer
back there and then this is a large Marc
Jacobs bronzer in the back with two Too
Faced Park shade bronzers below that I
have a foundation recently got rid of a
ton of foundations cuz I realized how
long I've owned them and a lot of them
probably went really bad these are kind
of like the foundations that I've tried
and I've liked and I want to go back to
in the front we have the Mac next to
nothing I have two shades because I'm
kind of in between and then we have just
standard Mac Studio fluid we all know
and remember this foundation kind of a
ride-or-die foundation for me we have
the Milani conceal on perfect I like
that one and lemare also very nice Make
Up For Ever is a standard foundation I
feel like this is really good for almost
every skin type and I also have the NARS
sheer glow very pretty for a more glowy
look at this Becca one I haven't tried
it yet but I would like to so it's there
and here I have all my stick foundations
still haven't tried the new Tarte ones
they're not in here yet it's still in
shipping and receiving this is the
hourglass foundation stick which I love
HD foundation stick which I like
wouldn't say I love but I wouldn't get
rid of it either so I must have some
feelings towards it Bobby Brown this is
foundation stick that I use to contour
I've been using it since I first started
on Instagram and I still love it so much
I use the shade almond for that and then
in here these are my drugstore ones
which are surprisingly some of my
favorite aside from the luminous silk
I just love drugstore foundations so the
infallible by L'Oreal under they have
the pro glow which I wouldn't say this
one works for me as well as it works for
Katie I haven't really found my color I
think I just need something that's not
so orange it's a little orange for me I
think then I have the fit me by
Maybelline this is probably one of my
favorite foundations I would say this
one and the matte and poreless from
drugstore are my favorite
I'm the shade 228 so I have them they're
back here we have some naked skin Urban
Decay foundations the one and done and
the more full coverage one and then I
also have powder foundations by Mac back
there if I'm breaking out on my
cheekbones
I'd contour with that because it gives
more coverage in those air
I like it then we have the primers
drawer and in here we have the Mac
strobe creams I haven't tried these
colors yet but I really love the gold
light that's my absolute favorite I
pretty much wear it every single day on
the skin I wouldn't say it's so much a
primer it actually just makes your skin
glow but I keep it in framers because I
kind of use it like one so I have the
Marc Jacobs primer which I really love
hydrating the two face primer is pretty
hydrating the new LC primer then we have
the tarte primer this is one of my
favorite primers for large pores I feel
like it just covers really well I also
put a small amount of this on my under
eyes if I'm feeling like they're gonna
crease because it prevents that too I
don't know if we're supposed to put this
on your under eyes it might be a little
heavy but I just put the tiniest amount
always goes for me that's like one of my
favorite back here we have some more
primers hourglass NARS primers the Too
Faced hangover we have makeup rubber
primers these are some of the best
primers I think they have one for every
skin type so if you're looking for a
good primer and you have a specific skin
type you could always just kind of check
their line I think they're amazing
they're hydrating one's really good and
then in here I have some oils some face
oils this probably shouldn't be in here
but it is you know how that goes this is
the Becca shimmering skin Perfector
should actually be in another door but
we're gonna let it live there this lorac
three in one light source primer is so
nice if you want that glowy face look
and then the back here we just have some
milk primers hope you guys try these I
haven't really tried it like giving it a
fair chance it's one of those things
where I'm like does it work a scene on
YouTube type of thing this is kind of
like my want to try out moving on to
highlighters this is one of my favorite
drawers so these are like my main bitch
highlighters I have another highlight
drawer over here which is kind of like
sidechick highlighters and here I have
Mac this one is really good it's the oh
darling this is the Dior highlight that
I really really
our new dare oh oh three and then and
here we have the new melt cosmetics
highlights and the new dose of colors
highlights along with some Oprah
highlight and then of course
shout out to Mac Daddy have all of his
artist Couture highlights these are
really really blingy like boom you want
to highlight this is where you go over
here we have Laura Geller because she is
my girl on liquid and stick highlights
the benefits of tart I haven't tried
those those are semi new or some
Maybelline and L'Oreal Charlotte Tilbury
I really like these iconic drops they're
pretty intense but they look phenomenal
if you just put like a tiny David mary
loumanizer
this is something I've been using for a
really long time so we just finished
this highlight drawer and then next to
it we actually have another highlighter
drawer
this one has some backups of like some
of my favorite things and the next
drawer we have some blush palettes these
are kind of just like cute little
palettes that I like to keep in here
they're actually being held up by these
letter holders or yeah I guess they're
what letter holders these are all
soaking the container store I just keep
cute little blush palette in here that I
love the packaging of the benefit ones
this is the Urban Decay Gwen Stefani
kabob one I met Gwen Stefani when I
bought this so it's very special to me
and then this last drawer we have good
old Costco makeup wipes Kirkland brand
freaking love them so as you can see I
make sure I stay stopped moving on to
the next section we have MAC lipsticks
certain brands I like to keep all the
items together because I feel like when
I think of a lipstick I need I'll think
oh Mack peach stock I'll always think of
Mack first before the color that makes
any sense so I have all my MAC lipsticks
in here and these little lipstick
containers and these are also from the
Container Store below that we have
concealers these are all my favorite
concealers or concealers that I'm trying
at the moment of course we have shape
tape in here love shape tape Becca aqua
luminous concealer this is like a
concealer I use every single day now I
don't want to say I trumped my NARS that
I feel like it kind of did cuz my no
makeup looks this is like the perfect
concealer if you want that no makeup
look or if you don't wear foundation and
you just want to wear a little bit of
something
that one looks really nice it keeps your
under-eyes hydrated it's beautiful this
NARS one I would say is like an
in-between like this one is super sheer
and this one is super heavy in this back
drawer here I have under-eye correctors
so if you have like dark circles or you
have some redness these are all the Make
Up For Ever HD concealers and some
bye-bye under-eye which is really good I
basically put all my tubed concealers in
here like the tarte maracuja that's like
an oldie for me I used to use that all
the time I have like my backup
concealers that are not yet opened the
blush drawer and here I have all blushes
that are more so my go choose like my
Mac one all the NARS blushes together
these little dividers here are also from
the Container Store and they go with the
drawers so you could buy the dividers

some over blushes I love apricot raisin

some Milani one similar to face and then
these blush duos
and then I also have all my cream
blushes that here the peach palette and
a little NARS palette back there oh my
gosh so this is the NARS palette I was
talking about this is one of the items
that like I'll never let go because
spent a lot of money on it when I
shouldn't have
and I cherished it so much and I was
like so excited when I bought this
because it had a bunch of blushes in it
and I was so obsessed with NARS and
their packaging and I still am I would
use this for jobs in my kit when I was
freelancing and I just felt so official
and very good memories I hold on to it
because they're just very special to me
then I have cream - liquid and blows

them around and then over here I keep my
Mac limited-edition lipsticks I like to
keep them all together
I typically don't use a lot of the
limited edition stuff more like
nostalgic more collectors type of thing
for me so they are all in hue and you
know I keep Selina upfront for these I
didn't label them because to be honest
I'm like what do I call this section
it's like Mavi but also brown but also
orange so I just didn't label them yet
but these are my Kat Von D liquid lip
dose of colors liquid that all these
colors together look so pretty I wish I
wore more of them and then we have Oprah

really really good hydrating I love
those moving on too dark liquid lips

Maybelline Milani tart
damn this is a miscellaneous drawer it
has a bunch of new items that I haven't
gone through it's a kind of a collection
that I just stuck in there this is red
lipsticks and then we have red liquid
lipsticks these are more like red /
orange so I have all the oranges here
then like the Reds that are a little bit
orange E and they get darker red as they
go to the back I love orange Reds it's
like one of my favorite pops of color
lip here we have some shadow quad I just
have a bunch of miscellaneous little
mostly Mac
collection pallets there's actually not
a lot back there here I have some more
individual eyeshadows but this is also
from The Container Store this video is
not sponsored by The Container Store by
the way I just I love going there to get
stuff they have like a lot of beauty
things there I don't like to keep a lot
of single eyeshadows I like to put them
in palettes because it's just more
convenient space wise but these are all
ones that are just like you're stuck in
there you know unless I melt them off
you nobody had time to be honest my
eyeshadows aren't really that organized
they're not like there's purple ones
back there bronzy ones here they're not
really by colors so I didn't label them
yet I'm not ready for the commitment
same thing with this drawer we have some
more single eyeshadows the Mac shadows
NYX shadows hot makeup Urban Decay I
love Urban Decay eyeshadows cuz they're
so pretty and I really like the
packaging too
that's pretty much it then I have my
NARS single shadows and double shadows I
love this packaging this is one of the
collections NARS recently did and the
packaging is like incredible probably
have my favorite packaging of all time
so she little NARS eyeshadows there's so
few so we have single NARS eyeshadows
there this is another eyeshadow drawer
very miscellaneous this is my lipgloss
drawer I don't wear lip glosses very
often I keep the nudes in front because
when I do wear gloss that's pretty much
all I wear everything else in here
lipgloss wise that isn't nude I pretty
much just keep around for tutorials or
special effects looks or anything like
that in here my why I sell stuff that I
have been opened honestly like it's so
nostalgic to me remembering the days
where like I really wanted to buy why I
sell stuff but couldn't and so I keep it
all in here I have an open date so
moving on to eyebrows I have my more
go-to eyebrows stuff in here this is
like brow backups pretty much the stores
where I put new brow items that I
haven't tried or backups of things that
I may already have open here's like a
bunch of some of my favorite brow
backups which is the benefit stuff my
favorite brow pencils gels and then I
also have soap I use for my brows if you
haven't seen my soap brow tutorial I
used a different one in that one which
was also good but this one is slightly
better Kati discovered this at a hotel
once and it was incredible in this store
we have my main bitch lashes so iconic
iconic lights queen bees
are like all the lashes I wear on the
regular iconic lights have become my
favorites I think I still love ikonics
for more dramatic looks but iconic
lights just look so nice and natural and
fluttery and then the queen bees
honestly they give me trouble applying
them it's like they only look really
bomb when Katie helps me so I have a lot
more of those because I don't get to
wear them very often and then we have
side-chick lashes either like you know I
like them I'll wear them but are they my
number one not really but I still like
them I have some other styles in here
that I'm meaning to wear mas lashes
right here these are all fairly new
these are the new Meraki lashes I've
showed you guys the packaging is so
pretty these are also popping these are
the salon perfect they remind me of the
Mac lashes you know the Mac 35 flutter
lashes in there as Lela lashes these are
the bottom lashes I like to wear
precious I also like flutter next you
have glitter liners I also put some
cream eyeshadow bases in here so it's
not just glitter liners at color tattoos
Stila ones anything that's really
sparkly in cream base or liquid based is
pretty much in there in the store we
have eyeshadow base is pretty
self-explanatory not that exciting of a
drawer I have gel liners in here also
with the dividers like everything else
just all laid out by color and then we
have pigments I try to separate them by
color just kind of separated by color
have our glitter drawer here same
concept they're kind of separated by
colors let me have the liquid liners
greens blues miscellaneous colors so
then these last two drawers down here
are mascaras these are all mascaras that
come and like little packages they don't
have boxes but I do put them in here
look at this one how to be on it for
desi that was really cute I really like
that here I have mascara villain boxes
this is also another drawer that I keep
for my friends and family to come over
and take mascaras because you know my
little lash haven't asked doesn't have
enough lashes that was a lot those
floating shelves up there container
store and I kind of just put cute things
up there that I do have a place for but
I didn't want to get rid of the
packaging this is like the Maybelline
lipsticks and the Charlotte Tilbury
and these are those NARS lip crayons and
then this is like something why I sell
scent that has mascaras in it with my
initials so now moving on to this
cabinet over here on this side this is
where I keep all my pencils and these
are like the best pencil holders because
they have six compartments and they're
from Cosmo cube I have them over here
too so I keep just all my red lip liners
together and then I have like my nude
lipstick liners pink and they're all
broken up by colors in here I know
there's a ridiculous amount of nude
liners I know you guys are judging me
here we have the same type of drawer
system but these are smaller than these
these are like the tiniest ones which
are perfect for things like this setting
sprays in here more setting sprays and
more stink breeze and then we have lip
treatments and scrubs lip balms brush
cleaners small tools all my tweezers in
here scissors sharpener lash curlers and
this one is all of my makeup removers
and then I have my Kylie liquid
lipsticks I keep them in the packaging I
do have some open that I that I use more
often which I don't keep them in the
boxes but you know I love the packaging
so that's it for that side and this
cabinet we have all of the skincare and
I broke it up by brand because I like
the way it looks overall I feel like
it's kind of like a store vibe and I
also like to have it like this because a
lot of my friends and family come over
again and take skincare and stuff and I
feel like they really shot by brand so I
like it kind of looking like that it
makes me really happy when I open this I
have my S key to my tatcha stuff lemare
Juice Beauty back there I love Juice
Beauty Dior
I haven't actually tried these things
are kind of new Charlotte Tilbury and
tart I love my h2o

cute little pallets if that's a category
just you know my style by her Rouge
palette my Tarte palettes and I love
this is what the Gwen Stefani palette

have the makeup geek mani MUA and then
the bomb palettes back here which i like

so much I was like I need to get another
one I have all of the Too Faced
chocolate palettes back here as well as
the Urban Decay Naked series palettes
those bring back memories as well that's
like the first palette I begged Steven
