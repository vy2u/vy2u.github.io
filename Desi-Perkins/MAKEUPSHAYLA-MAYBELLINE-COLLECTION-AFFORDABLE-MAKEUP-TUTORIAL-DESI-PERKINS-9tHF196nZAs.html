today I'm really excited to film this
video because it'll be using my girl
shameless collection with Maybelline
that is a huge accomplishment I'm so
proud of you Shayla she came out with
the city mini palette this has a lot of
goods like on-the-go colors where you
could just take this palette and create
a bunch of different looks and then she
also has these three mascaras that is
black pop and purple and boom and blue I
believe yes mm-hm
boom in in blue those names are very
hurt and then look at the back there's
Shayla baby Shayla that's so cool I've
seen pictures on Twitter people seeing
this in stores and I'm really proud of
you Shayla and I'm really excited to do
this makeup look using this collection I
wanted to do a very sultry sexy matte
look these are the colors I use this one
this one this one in this one so here's
some swatches for you guys you can see
all the shades in the palette swatch
they are really really beautiful we're
going to go ahead and swatch this nice
purple shade here it's super pretty I
love it then let's go into this which is
more of the matte burgundy Browns of
black shade which is pretty dark really
pigmented here now we're going to go
into warm gold shades then there's this
really nice light gold shade and lastly
we have a nice matte bone color to set
your eyeshadow base and or highlight the
brow bone so those are the swatches all
beautiful love the colors and with all
that said let's go ahead and get started
with the tutorial hmm starting off with
makeup shaylen palette I'm so happy that
there is a brow bone highlight shade I
kind of already primed my eyes and put
this down here but I'm going to do it
again next I'm going to take this matte
shade right here on a blending brush
we're going to put this into our crease
I'm going to lift up my lid here so that
I could get the perfect shape of maja I
just kind of wanted this to be like a
get ready with me
chitchat type video I'm so excited for
Shayla and for basically everybody that
is living their dreams coming out with
these incredible collaborations
never get tired of seeing collaborations
with brands because it's people living
their dreams and succeeding at it and
I'm just like all for that you know it's
just such a incredible feeling
now that we've launched with DOS and you
guys showed so much support also
everyone on YouTube I was watching
everyone's videos that is doing watching
reviews and whether the reviews are good
bad or indifferent whatever it is it's
just like it's crazy to search the
collection and see all those videos pop
up it's really just like every time I
see it I'm like down we did that and I
know Shayla Katy and I we have this
group chat we kind of always are talking
about living our dreams and this is so
incredible and we definitely think about
it every day it makes me really happy
picking up the same exact shade but with
a more dense brush this is a Mac 217
which I haven't used in forever I'm
gonna hit this outer corner real quick
I'm also going to go into the inner
corner whatever's left over I'm just
going to take it in the center as well
oh I'm already loving this every time I
go to do like a soft eye my ass is over
here was like a crazy smoky eye by the
end of the video I'm actually going to
mix this shade that I put into the
crease with the lighter shade I'm going
to pack that onto my lid because I want
it to be slightly lighter than the
crease but still on the same family of
tones and I'm just gonna lightly pack
that all over the lid also going to make
sure to pack it on the outer part of the
eye here the outer V next we're going to
go in with what is my favorite liquid
liner the NYC liquid liner affordable I
used to find at Target I'm going to be
doing a wing wish me luck you guys I did
one the other day but it took a lot of
concentration and lack of breathing so
we're going to do first is create a line
connecting the lower lash line to the
tail of the brow so sometimes I want to
do the line first on both sides because
it makes it easier for me to see like
the actual direction of the wing and now
we're going to bring it back now I'm
just going to go in and perfect it clean
it up next I'm going to mix to
foundation this is the infallible Pro
matte which has like a really nice matte
full coverage
and then this one is super dewy but this
one is really really warm and tan for me
just mix them both on this little candle
holder
after highlight and contour and
everything everything will work out you
just hope I think it will take my Beauty
Blender and blending it all in I
realized like I haven't done an
affordable makeup look video and so long
I'm so sorry I know I get stuck in my
ways of like the things that I always
use but it's funny because I really do
love drugstore products especially
foundations some of my favorite
foundations are drugstore at one point I
was using the Maybelline master list and
the Loreal Pro matte so much but I was
like oh going to switch it up and try
using other products so now I'm back
boom boom boom and hey sigh while I have
a nail appointment I'm and then we're
probably going to have dinner together
getting a little bit more my Beauty
Blender and going over these areas where
I need a little more coverage if I go
into my nail appointment with this full
face I bet you linen van or who do my
nails they probably gonna be like who
are you
I always go in there look at all kinds
of crazy baby hairs just free-flowing no
makeup no brows done nothing and then
when I try to tell them like I do makeup
they're just like yeah okay so I show
them a picture yeah look see if you make
up their like whose name is that you I
was like thanks I don't blame them but
you know now it's time for concealer I
may use the color pop concealer to me
this is like a really affordable I think
it's six dollars which is even less than
the drugstore I have noticed two things
from this concealer one initially I put
it on loved it I felt like it had really
good coverage it has a really beautiful
finish but I did notice that it did
slightly oxidize under my eyes so when I
said it it did get out like a little
darker I still think it has like a
really nice finish I like the coverage
so I'm going to use it then I just
wanted to take a deeper shade and mix it
with a lighter shade I feel like it has
balanced it out but we'll see what it
looks like on camera first I take
channel 3 which is super super super
dark putting this color because it is
very peachy just right here in the
darker parts of my under eyes take my
Beauty Blender and blend that out
I'm gonna go in with medium tan which is
a lot lighter boom-boom-boom-boom
one side to the nose around the smile
line tip that one time puts on the
center of my forehead to highlight that
see this is a little pink an undertow
which you know I don't really get down
with but I'm hoping with like the dark
undertone it neutralizes or it will get
very ashy one of the two
going on with a Maybelline master chrome
highlight in molten gold this has just
been going around the internet like
crazy because it is in fact the best
drugstore highlight I've ever used in my
life they did it right and I love it so
much what I like to do is apply it and
the high point and then I like to like
blend out the edges I'm also going to
hit the tip of my nose at this found the
brand you keep it well watching
attention I like to kind of go over it
too sometimes my Beauty Blender to melt
it into the skin and I'm going to take
the Maybelline fit me loose powder this
isn't a shade 20 light medium I'm going
to dust that under my eyes and set the
center of my face press it right there
between the brawls center of the
forehead along the sides of my nose I
just take the setting powder and really
just like dab it over my cheeks like it
gets into those pores and clogs them
right up for me so that you can't see
them I'm going to take a nice fluffy
blending brush like the Smith 235 here
I'm going to go back into the shade
we've been using in the crease and I'm
going to start smoking out that lower
lashline outer corner first and I'm
bringing it in I like to take a blending
brush first to get a nice diffused look
and then I deepen it with a smaller
brush after I don't always do that but
that's what I'm doing today I'm going to
take my dose of colors purple rice and
I'm really define that lower lash line I
always like dip into the palette and
then tap my brush onto my compact
assures that all the loose particles
that are on the bristles dust off so
they don't fall on your face when you go
to pack it on to your eye makeup taking
my la girl pencil these are also really
really affordable I always use this
black shade here and I'm going to first
put it in the up here area very
technical I'm going to put it on the
waterline I got to get in close sorry
that you can't see you go extra heavy on
the outer corner because I want that to
kind of give a more holdback appearance
a little thinner in the inner corner
it'll give you that cat eye effect a
little better taking my pencil brush
that I used for the shadow I'm going to
smoke the
Javad out so it's going to give it a
nice gradient instead of looking super
abrupt black liner I love when I hear
the wind howling outside like this moon
it makes me think of Halloween I am cold
I'm so stoked I don't really have like
solid ideas yet I wouldn't say but I
have artwork that I've saved that has
inspired me now I'm going to take the
bright gold in this palette which is
right over here I'm going to pick that
up on a pencil brush and you got as my
inner corner highlight look at that
inner corner highlight Shayla also
launched mascaras with Maybelline's this
is a big shot mascara formula but the
black one in her line is more black than
the original it's the blackest black is
what she say it's going to make your
lashes really dark I'm just going to
apply a quick coat of mascaras we're
gonna apply falsies for lashes I'll be
applying the our gel faux mink lashes
it's actually my first time trying this
style 811 I didn't apply these I got so
much glue on my eyeliner but that's okay
because it'll dry clear I actually go
back into this palette and take a little
bit of the black just add it to the
outer corner of my lower lash line back
here see how it kind of blurs and smokes
it out even more sultry yes COCs yes
we're going to go into the NYX
highlighting contour palette because I
need to snatch this nose one time for
the one time I'm going to take this
shade right here and a contour is a very
tip of the nose here gives you like a
little pinched tip nose effect and then
I blend it upwards but mostly focusing
it on the very point of the nose we're
going to also contour be fake this is a
Maybelline New York powder brush has a
nice little angle we're going to hit
that contour one time sup in the tubes
and just kind of sit it into the hollow
I'll be taking a Maybelline fit me blush
and this is in the shade rose by the way
this video is not sponsored by
Maybelline I just had a lot of products
that I wanted to try from them just in
case anyone's alright make this face
like this I'm just going to use this
blush to marry the bronzer and the
highlight together change of plans
the color may be a little too light for
me both please one moment the wine
burgundy we're going to go in with this
one oh boy I went from too light to
really pigmented pulling back pulling
back and we shake your Beauty Blender
and just blend those edges out I'm
actually going to put some over my nose
kind of want to look flushed all over
for the lip I'm gonna be using the
Maybelline vivid hot lip liqueur and 62
you feel like super pigmented lip
glosses they're like liquid lipsticks
but glossy cuz they're that pigmented
you know you like look at that
absolutely pretty so this is the
finished makeup look hmm hmm so that's
it for this video thank you guys so much
