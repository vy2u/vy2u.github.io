today's video is going to be a
foundation review I received so many new
foundations and this one caught my eye
this is the new Marc Jacobs youthful
look 24 hour foundation youthful is the
word that got me there are certain words
that get me on packaging it's like glowy
radiant youthful empty food dewy
long-lasting full coverage all keywords
that like draw me towards the product so
what I'm gonna be doing in this video is
talking about the foundation testing it
out and I'm also going to be wearing it
throughout the day and checking in with
you guys so you can see and I can see
how it wears throughout the day we're
gonna go ahead and dive in going into
the details of this foundation it says
that it has an invisible SPF which means
if you were to take flash photography
with this foundation on you would not
have flash back that really intrigued me
we'll be doing a flashback test just to
make sure it says it's self setting it's
a medium buildable foundation it has a
blue Daisy extract which helps alleviate
the dulling effects pollution has on our
skin it says it uses snow mushroom
nature's answer to hyaluronic acid
meaning it provides insane hydration
there's 29 different shades there are
yellow beige golden caramel pink and red
undertones I wish there was the word all
up in there this the only word that's
missing for me alright we're gonna go
ahead and swatch all the colors so
that's for the lights this is a row of
some of the medium shades I can see all
the different undertones the yellow the
gold and the pink here okay so here's
the next set of swatch colors re and
then we have deep and those are all of
these swatches so that's kind of a
rundown on all the details of this
foundation this bottle contains one
point through eight fluid ounces I
really love the packaging I think it's
so cute sleek and chic I like them it's
not super bulky and I feel like if
you're somebody who just carries one
makeup bag that's not me but if you're
that person this is just so nice and
literally just so alongside the
foundation there is a brush here which
came in the pr package that is for this
foundation application and it is the
seamless brush for me this is going to
be
really different to apply a foundation
with because I don't usually use like a
flat paddle brush ever to apply
foundation so what I think I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna use this on one half of my
face to see how it applies the
foundation and on the other half I'll
use my normal foundation tool that I
would normally use just so I can get a
feel of the difference between using the
brush that they suggest at whatever I
would use at home once watching the
foundation I found that I was between
two shades I can go either way I feel
like I could wear 370 and it's a little
bit more true to color or I could do 390
and give myself a little bit more of a
tan I think I'm gonna go with 370
because I did wear this the other day
and it was fine but if I get a little
tanner
I think 390 will be a good color for me
as well we're gonna go with 370 so on
this side of the face I'm gonna go ahead
and use the seamless brush I'm just
gonna take a dollop I don't even know
how to use a brush like this anymore it
doesn't really have it too much of a
scent like there's something there but
not anything floral or anything like
that so far my first impression just
applying it is that I feel like it gave
a really nice natural finish it's even
but it's not super cakey or even really
looks like I have a lot of foundation on
so this is one layer with the foundation
using the brush this is no foundation
yet so like I said just kind of evens
everything out over here
I think I'll use a Beauty Blender on the
other side just because I feel like
that's what I normally use I'm gonna
just put the foundation on with this
brush and then blend it in with the
Beauty Blender just so I can disperse
product without the sponge absorbing at
all it's really hard to tell which one I
like more
alright so according to my brother who's
sitting in here he says that this one
looks beside what the brush looks a
little more natural finish and this side
with the Beauty Blender looks a little
bit more full coverage now that I've had
time to really look at both sides deep
into my skin I wouldn't say that this is
super necessary I feel like you could
just use the Beauty Blender cuz I think
both sides look really nice I think when
I apply this again I'll probably just
stick to my Beauty Blender cuz that's
what I know it's just like one tool that
I use for my concealer and my foundation
and it
it's nicely and I just really like how
my skin looks with this foundation I
feel like it's so natural it's not as
mad as I thought it was gonna look but
it's like healthy it does give a
youthful glow youthful that's the word
all right let's hit a deep zoom on this
are you in there all right I like it
feel like it looks really good now I'm
gonna go ahead and do the rest of my
face makeup that way
I can really see how it looks throughout
the day I'm just gonna go ahead and
apply my normal concealer highlight so
that I could really see what's going on
I'm gonna be using my Maybelline age
rewind I just use this all the time so
I'm just going in with a little
concealer since it says it's self
setting I'm not gonna set it so that you
guys can see how it wears if you don't
set it this is probably my favorite
drugstore concealer so now I'm gonna go
in with a little highlight I'm gonna be
using our dose of colors does the X Katy
Fuego highlights give the skin a little
glow here let's go ahead and hit it with
a little bronzer using my just my
benefit hoola bronzer that little
forehead I'm gonna put a little bronzer
through my crease that doesn't have
anything to do with reviewing the
foundation but I'm gonna do it anyway I
woke up the other morning if you guys
didn't see my insta story and my eye
looked like Will Smith and hitch after
he had an allergy literally just like
closed over here in this inner corner
and you know how you have a dip right
here between the nose and your inner
corner I didn't it was like fat all the
way across today's the first day it's
better I'm still not wearing eye makeup
so I thought I would film a foundation
review I looked crazy but apparently you
know I don't we don't know what it was
because nothing was wrong with like my
actual eyeball I don't know guys at
first I thought Stephen straight up gave
me pinkeye like I said this mother I
don't know what he does to get back at
me
this is married life you understand all
right so this is it so now I'm gonna go
ahead and do the flash photography test
to make sure that it has no flash back
as it claims so let's go ahead and do
that and put it right over here
all right it's been about two hours
since I applied the foundation it's not
gathering in any areas it looks pretty
much the same two hours in so still
pretty early but looking good I'm not
getting oily here everything is still
looking good really what I look for is
if it gathers in my fine lines and if I
get really shiny around my nose I'm not
getting shiny at all anywhere and
remember I didn't set this with powders
and we're back so this is my last and
final check-in for the day I decided to
bring it back into the studio because
it's dark and I have no good lighting
anywhere else it is now 9 o'clock at
night
and honestly I haven't touched up
powdered in my face all day and I feel
like it held up really well
I see like some oils peeking through but
not oily it's almost just like a sheen
but I don't feel like my nose is
slippery
you know after you have a warrant
foundational day and you feel like
around your nose area like your
foundation could just slide right off if
you even touched it I feel like it still
looks pretty set especially for not
touching it up I usually touch up my
nose throughout the day that's the only
part that looks a little shiny
everything else still looks really good
faded like a little bit around my nose
because I've been rubbing my nose a
little bit not too much to where it's
super noticeable when I'm looking really
closely I do see a little breakup of the
foundation around my nose but it's
nothing where it's like oh my god girl
like you need to go redo your foundation
it's just normal so this is my final
thoughts on the foundation the pros I
love the packaging I love the color
selection I feel like it has really good
range of undertones especially I love
the finish I like how it wears
throughout the day
there's no flashback so that was great
that it past the flashback test I would
honestly say for cons there's only one
con and that's it I feel like I had to
squeeze a lot of product out in order to
get like my whole face really fully
evenly covered with other foundations
it's like three pumps and you're like
okay that works for my whole face I did
feel like it was like a little more than
usual but I don't really have any other
negatives about it it's very rare that I
can find an undertone that matches
perfectly to my skin which I feel like
this does so let me know in the comments
down below if you guys have tried it do
you like it do you not like it and if
you have tried it don't forget to leave
your skin type so that people can relate
or maybe if you have an oilier skin type
or drier skin type I feel like that
really helps people in the comments
below
so yeah thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye
is there a trash talk about something
like i'm famiiy i see Shumacher</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
