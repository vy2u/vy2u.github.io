today's video is going to be a tutorial
on this eye makeup look it's gonna be
eyes cheeks and lips I skip over my
foundation just because I do my
foundation pretty much the same in every
videos I wore this eye makeup two videos
ago and the products I've been loving
and you guys really loved it so I
thought I would film it for you guys
this look is very rich very red burgundy
maroon really really sultry sexy makeup
look so let's go ahead and get started
with the tutorial so first I'm going to
go ahead and just pry my lids this one
is by Mac and it's the prepping prom 24
hour extend eye base I'm taking this
dose of colors blending brush and I'm
just going to go ahead and focus most of
it on the lid so that most of the
product starts there and then slowly
disperse it up into the crease all the
way across every surface of your lid
because if se you get eyeshadow base
here but then you miss a spot over here
once you put your eyeshadow in that area
it's going to stick to the eyeshadow
base in certain areas and then it's
going to look different in the spot
where you didn't have the eyeshadow base
so it's really important to use a soft
brush to kind of get it all over the eye
so next I'm going to go ahead and set
the lid with a shadow I like to use this
lighter color because it highlights the
brow bone as you can see here I shadow
I'll be using to do that is Mac's Blanc
type and I'll be using the dose of
colors shader brush I like this one
because it's a large fluffy shader it's
really nice to get all the way across
the lid quickly I concentrate most of it
right under the brow bone because that's
where we want the most highlight but I
do more of a packing motion here in the
highest point and then whatever's left
over I lightly dust across the other
parts of the eye so next I'm going to
pick up this warm toned Brown and this
is from the melt cosmetics stack called
dark matter I'm going to use that with
the Sigma tapered blending brush so with
the transition shade I really like to
lightly map out the shape of our I show
and it's totally fine if you cover the
lid as well because we're gonna be
covering a whole leg with the maroon
shade if you try to go in with a dark
color only it's gonna look really harsh
not as blended and it's gonna be harder
for you to blend as well so you really
want to make sure to go in with a
lighter shade and build from lightest to
darkest I like to keep my eye kind of
open and just lightly get the shape
going here and also whatever's left over
on the brush after you've really blended
into the crease then you want to really
swoosh it out kind of like a swoosh it's
gonna lightly winged out the eyeshadow
without being too harsh if you try to
wing out the eyeshadow with a lot of
product it's gonna look kind of crazy
next going from the same eyeshadow stack
we're going to take this shade enigma
I'm gonna be taking that with a sigma
small tapered blending brush like I said
I usually have my eye open to get the
shape of what the eye shadow is gonna
look like with my eyes open just lightly
map it out real quick
somebody just snapped me and told me
that they thought they could never have
a cut crease and then they watched the
video that I just did that how to fake
having a defined crease type of thing
and that they were really happy that
they were able to achieve it and it made
me super happy really love getting
messages like that because I know it
won't work for everybody because
everyone's lives are different but it
was really nice to see that it worked
for somebody I so as you can see I'm not
really winging this maroon eyeshadow out
quite yet I'm starting very modest just
getting the shape and then we get to the
winging part even though I'm really
applying the eyeshadow with my eye open
to see what's gonna look like I also
have to look up and fill in the gaps
because if I just do this and sometimes
it won't get into the creases of the
eyes keep your blending brush really
close by because you want to blend out
those edges and the milk cosmetic stock
actually has an eyeshadow called blur
this eyeshadow in particular was
specifically made to fix mistakes or
blur out edges well I like to take a
little bit of that on the blending brush
so it's a really light color and as I'm
going I will
just buff out those edges just enough
pigment to really move the product
around smooth it out super light color I
really like it though let's pick up the
good old Mac 217 taking the tiniest
amount of eyeshadow on this and now
we're gonna wing it out imagine a line
coming from your lower lash line up into
this wing and connecting sometimes I
like to just fake swoosh here and then
so that it all connects once we're done
so when I did this I I took a little bit
of dramatical by Saucebox
I like to use it to kind of smoke this
out just a little bit so I'm taking that
on a Smith 230 brush and with this color
you really just want to take a small
amount I'm just I'm just adding it to
the edges I feel like I can't say dress
without saying shoes for this Center
highlight I almost just wanted to look
like a little beam of light is hitting
the center of your lid first you want to
use a cream base just so that it really
pops in the center this is the sticks
and stones dose of color eye duo and I'm
actually only using this top part taking
that on a zoeva small detailed shader
brush it's almost like I'm just
highlighting my eye in a way over top of
that I applied this eye shadow let me
tell you it's a struggle eye shadow now
don't
we got a son we had an accident so the
eye shadow is now down I'm just gonna
put that right over the eye shadow base
that we applied this is a BH henna you
want to use a patting motion right in
the center so you just want to pack that
onto the center first this is a very red
eyeshadow look more so than cranberry
it's more of a maroon red after we
packed it onto the center you're just
gonna take your brush lightly feather
the edges see when you open your eye
there's a really pretty effect in that
area now next I'm applying a little bit
of my la girl Pro concealer under the
eye I won't be doing the face makeup in
this tutorial guys know I usually like
to do my concealer after my foundation
but since we're just doing the eyes in
this video I need to apply the concealer
now and then I'll be using the morphe
t27 brush to blend it out so next what
you want to do is go back into Saucebox
eyeshadow dramatical and I'm gonna use
that as my starting color to blend my
lower lash line it's really just gonna
be kind of a base for the darker shade
and we're gonna smoke it out so it just
halos around the darker shade I'm taking
a bigger blending brush now and really
diffusing that out connecting it also to
the top part of the eyeshadow going back
into our dark matter stack the enigma
shade I'm just going to pack that on the
lower lash line so to really tie in the
shimmer on the lid we're going to be
using this pencil liner by colour-pop
it's in the shade get paid it's a really
pretty liner for the waterline I will
say I feel like the twist on this could
be better the twist sometimes it falls
on me so for the lashes I'm going to be
using the Maybelline and false e push-up
drama mascara and you just want to apply
a light coat to top and bottom just to
prep it for the false lashes for lashes
i'll be using Koko lashes in the style
Queen B
so I went ahead and applied my
foundation I just used my Mac Studio Fix
fluid I also applied my bronzer and
highlighter same techniques that I've
been doing in the last few videos so I
just decided to skip through it today
for the blush I will be using over a
apricot blush to apply that I'll be
using the dose of colors tapered blush
brush so this blush is just going to
give a very light hint of color to the
cheeks I don't want anything too
overpowering I also use the NYX
highlighting contour palette as well to
contour my face all right so the last
thing for the look is gonna be the lips
when I originally did this makeup look
in my last video I used the LA girl
natural lip liner I think an only stole
it I don't know how she gets these
things but I can't find it anywhere so
I'm gonna switch the lip liner and I
will be using the OCC trick lip liner
you don't really need a lip liner per se
but you know I'm gonna use one anyway
and then for lipstick I'm going to be
using the Ophir liquid lipstick in the
shade Ahri's and this is in collab with
many MUA
it's like a very pinky peach color I
really love Oprah's liquid lipsticks I
think they're really really good alright
