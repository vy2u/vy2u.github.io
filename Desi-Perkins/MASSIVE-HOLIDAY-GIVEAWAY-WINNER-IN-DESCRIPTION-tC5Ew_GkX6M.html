that said let's get on with the giveaway
I'm really excited to show you guys all
these things i snapchatted the other day
shopping online everything you see here
is from Macy's they had 12 percent cash
back on Ebates you know I had to go
shopping with that 12 percent if you
guys haven't heard of eBay it's
basically a website where you go and
under that website it's pretty much
every store that I would ever shop at
Sephora Ulta may cease Nordstrom Nasty
Gal like everything but you go under the
Ebates website and then go to those
stores and every store at different
times have different percentages of cash
back Ebates hazy to go shopping there
are no strings attached let's just say I
walked into Macy's I decided to buy this
fix+ by Mac all I would get is this
fixed plus fee like here have a good day
thank you so much for shopping but if
you shop online with eBay and you go to
Macy's website through Ebates I got 12
percent cashback when I did all this

love it I'm telling you right now you
will thank me thank you so much let's
move on to all of these products as I'm
sure you guys are excited and I'm really
excited to show you guys so so the very
first brush that I'm going to be giving
away is the mac 135 brush this brush was
made famous in the video where I applied
a bronzer helmet to my face and the no
mirror makeup challenge
it's the perfect bronzer brush in my
opinion because it's so big it just
perfectly distributes the bronzer all
over your face I like to use it around
my forehead cheekbones jawline just
everything it's amazing just in case
people are wondering sanitary purposes
you're not getting this one this is mine
because I have a whole other set for you
guys so the next brush is this one by
Mac it's the 168 brush this is my
favorite contour brush I use this for
everything perfectly fits into the
hollows of the face its taper it's
beautiful then we have the Mac 137 this
brush looks very interesting and at
first you're kind of like what do I do
with this it's so light it's not super
dense the way the bristles are it's
gonna apply a little amount of product
this brush is ideal for highlighter what
I'll do is I'll dip this into my betty
loumanizer and I lightly dust that over
the face to give a very light subtle
glow and of course the staple brush
everybody should have the best blending
brush the Mac 217 I love it so much this
was the first brush that I bought I
remember just being like whoa these
brushes are expensive but you know what
I'll be giving away today so the next
brush honest hacia a 23 brush I use this
every single day to highlight the
cheekbone I always dampen the brush and
it distributes the highlighter so
beautifully I mean look Meeta lastly for
the brushes I have Tarte swirl powder
it's so different and unique I just
thought I would throw it in there I
really really like it for bronzer as
well the next item I'm giving away is
the original Beauty Blender if you've
tried any other Beauty blenders in the
past and they weren't the actual Beauty
Blender brand you don't know what you're
missing out on I swear I've tried so
many and this one is by far the best the
next thing I'll be giving away is this
Mac palette here when I saw it on the
website online it looked a lot bigger so
now that I received it I'm like whoa
that's a lot smaller than I thought it
was gonna be it's so tiny
it's the burgundy times nine eyes shadow
palette I wanted to try it so I got one
for me and one for the giveaways so
you'll also be getting this you guys
know it wouldn't be a giveaway from me
if I didn't include Mac's give me Sun
bronzer this is by far everything to me
I have a really deep connection with it
huh so pretty I just love the formula of
this bronzer I love the color this just
does everything for me i shadow base
this is the Mac soft ochre and something
that I feel like everyone should have
let me open it
so cold I can barely even Jeff yeah Jeff
can't open it either
dang nothing was like really tight I've
got it open guys whoo whoo this will
cover everything and give you a nice
even base to work off of
in my opinion my eye shadow never crease
this when I wear this the last Mac item
that I have is of course mac fix+
this is a must-have as well it doesn't
set your makeup to be long lasting
however it does set your makeup fix+
actually makes all the powders dissolve
and look more skin like you just spritz
a little fix+ on it you become one with
the powder looks beautiful it also makes
your highlight pop just spritz a little
on the highlight from a distance oh so
good this is a staple also in my makeup
kit this is the Laura Mercier
translucent powder everybody uses this
to bake their under eyes and bake their
whole face you can even use it just to
lightly set your under-eye concealer set
your makeup set whatever you want really
set new goals I don't know but it's the
best I love this stuff next we have the
benefit what's up cream highlighter that
I apply with my finger on my cheekbones
before I apply the powder highlight it
makes your highlight pop so this stuff
is amazing this will also be in the
giveaway I have some Inglot products we
have Inglot gel liner in black which is
number 77 everyone's got to have a good
gel liner this one is the best I also
picked out this Inglot pigment this is
in the shade 22 it just spoke to me it
said you need to put me in the giveaway
Inglot makes some of the most beautiful
pigment so I'm really excited for you
guys to win this another thing that I
wanted to throw in there was something
that was just cute on Macy's website
this Tarte
eyelash curler gift set and I thought it
was so beautiful
it's studded with diamonds comes with
the Tarte lights camera flashes mascara
comes inside of here now we're gonna get
to the big stuff the big guns ready for
pallets contour kit by Anasazi of
Beverly Hills
this is the medium contour kit comes
with a Berkeley highlighter contour
powder some under-eye powders everything
cross my fingers I hope this works for
whoever wins the giveaway the next
palette is also from Anasazi of Beverly
Hills
self-made palate I love this palette
because it seems to have a lot of
different shades pops of color shimmery
tone matte colors good variety palette I
had to throw this in there because I
just feel like you guys love the Naked
palette I just feel like I can be a rock
star when I wear this it does still have
light colors which is nice because not
everybody is gonna be like rocking a
really intense smokey eyes but I figured
what a good mixture so the last thing in
the giveaway is gonna be the Urban Decay
Gwen Stefani palette from a distance and
maybe on camera it looks like a Kinect
for you you know what I mean like just
kind of remind you connect for but in
person I swear it's so beautiful like I
actually have it on display in my makeup
room at my display shelf because I think
it's so pretty
also because I got to meet when
Stephanie when I got this palette and I
feel like I have a connection with her
now even though she probably doesn't
even remember me like I don't know but I
just feel that way like we're friends
now alright guys so that's everything in
this massive Google one I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video and I'm
