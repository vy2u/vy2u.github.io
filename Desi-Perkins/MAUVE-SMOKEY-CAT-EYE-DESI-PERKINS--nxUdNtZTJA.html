today's video is gonna be a makeup
tutorial on this look I actually love
this makeup look I don't do mom's very
often these Mavi pink shades but I love
how this makeup look turned out at the
zoom honey can I get a zoom can I get a
little zoom zoomy zoom no no don't get
pull back fall back
oh right okay this is the makeup look
we're doing today guys I'm also going to
teach you the technique of elongated the
eyes and making them way more cat eye
like you guys ready for it just do the
first we're going to dip into some
eyeshadow base this is Mac soft ochre
and I'm just using a what is this a
sigma baek precision brush just grab any
buffing brush so that you can get a nice
even layer real quick I did my brows
off-camera but if you want a tutorial on
these brows it's the last video uploaded
I'll link it in the description box so
next I'm just going to pick up a bone
color - eye shadow and setting that you
guys could use translucent powder as
well just want to make sure we set the
base I do this step every single time as
we miss you guys in so you can see
better I'm using tan lines now this is
by makeup geek cosmetics on a smith - 4
7 we're going to go ahead and apply this
on the outer corner here and sweep it
into the crease and then up towards the
upper crease I'm also going to place
that in the inner corner just kind of
look straight and just dig the brush
into this inner corner area and start
wiggling right in here not the tear duct
okay just a little bit above that and
start blending this eyeshadow in there
the look I was going for was a crease
that was really dark on the inner part
of the eye and the outer part
putting the tip of the brush with the
most product into the crease and then
lightly blending it outwards towards
this brow bone and whatever's left over
just slightly sweep it through the rest
of the crease so that we have a
connection here but it's not going to be
a super defined connection just a nice
little shadow there I'm going into the
shade called blur by melt cosmetics and
this is intended to blur out the edges
of your eyeshadow so that's what I'm
going to do I take that and just lightly
sweep it with a clean brush along the
edges of that shadow that we just placed
in our crease and upper crease this is
kind of the effect we want it's really
really soft and as you can see it's like
darker on the inner and outer parts of
the eyes both sides and we're gonna
we're gonna bump that up even more gonna
see again hold please okay back so we're
going to take raat I love this is like
one of my favorite dark eyeshadows
because it's not really warm it's not
really cool it's kind of just like a
good in-between this is by melt
cosmetics this is what's gonna pump this
look up even more taking that on the
same brush this is a really good brush
for blending like precision blending the
Smith brush this is the 247 I mentioned
earlier but this eyeshadow is super
pigmented be careful
I always start right here on this outer
corner tilt your head back so you could
see right where your crease is kind of
just start blending that out and I made
sure to put it right in the crease so I
haven't dipped back into the eyeshadow
since the initial amount that I got just
want to make sure with these dark shades
that you're really blending them out
before you add more product to get the
idea of the shape I'm going to go into
the inner corner same spot we put the
first eyeshadow
we're just deepening it up now and
focusing it more on to the crease okay
bliss now we're going to use soft brown
by Mac this to me has a little bit of a
Mavi undertone so I'm just going to pack
this all of
the lid and I'm using a brush that has
no name on it so so weird I love this
brush but I never have seen a name on it
don't know where it came from just like
a flat fluffy blending brush it's good
for packing on eyeshadow but it also is
like a little bit more fluffy than a
standard flat brush so it's nice to
blend after I apply that lid color I go
back into the Smith brush that I was
using to apply the raht shade and I'm
just gonna blend in those edges one more
time just to kind of mix the Mavi tone
on the lid with the crease color all
right let's do the wing shall we I need
to find the winged liner is the
situation that I have right now I hate
those moments where you put something
down like you just sat had it now it's
gone that happens to me all over here
does I found me I've been using this
Bobbi Brown liquid liner I really like
it has a little bit of a sparkle to it
like a gold Sparkle I also really loved
one by Kat Von D that I used to have but
it also grew legs and walked away never
came back this is the one that I'm using
now it's called golden brahms
sparkle and we're gonna do a serious
wing when we lift my robe sleeves up do
a little stretch all right here we go
tilt your head back and take it to the
brow and bring it back now I'll just go
ahead and fill it in hey you gotta just
take it make it a dramatic wing oh so
I've been able on getting my eyes by
adding a more defined point here in the
inner corner but we'll do that with eye
shadow after the liner and after the
concealer so now I'm taking my
foundation we're going to move on to the
face before finish the eyes this is the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk number 7.5
just put it onto this little it's like a
candleholder dish you get them at
Michael's we're going into tan at my
face I had a facial the other day and I
got extractions so I have one like here
healing you know these ones I feel like
I'm starting all over again with like
new skin now I'm going to do my
concealer I'm mixing two of the Becca
aqua luminous perfecting concealers I'm
mixing warm honey and medium for honey's
really dark for me actually but I feel
like it kind of cancels out it's a kind
of skin tone so I put a little bit of
those first and then medium is super
light I don't think there's actually a
color that's like perfect for me
medium is also like a little bit a sheer
for my skin tone so the warm honey mix
what this really helps putting that on
the sides of my nose as well I actually
really love this concealer for like that
no makeup look it's actually the only
concealer I've ever ever used that looks
like no makeup when it's on your skin it
doesn't have full coverage though I will
tell you that much I don't think it's
meant to have full coverage it's more of
a light coverage concealer but it's so
pretty
and if you want a more full coverage
concealer the torch shade tape is good
I'm just gonna add a I don't feel like I
really need to but just like a little
right here this is the tan sand I don't
put this too close to my eyes though cuz
I feel like it's a little too dry for my
under eyes I need more hydration so I
keep it more in the hollows of my eyes
instead and it works really good and
we're going to go ahead and set the
concealer Laura Mercier translucent
powder this on the side of my nose to
make it look a little bit more narrow
I'm going to set my foundation with this
Charlotte Tilbury powder I don't know if
you guys have noticed but I've never
really stuck to one face powder I feel
like I always switch around because I've
never found a powder that I'm like this
is amazing but this is actually amazing
this is the shade to medium and it's
such a finely milled powder that it
doesn't look crazy on your face you know
what I mean and I have a problem with
blotting my nose like my nose gets
really really shiny throughout my day
with my makeup but with this stuff it's
like you put it right over your shine
and it just like melts into the skin it
looks mad I'm going to finish off the
eyes really quick I'm going into tan
lines this is the makeup geek eyeshadow
that we used in the crease the first
color we use and I'm going to run that
on my lower lash line focus most of the
powder on the outer corner of the eye
and then slowly drag it in
it's I really like this eyeshadow just
like a really good Mavi mid-tone brown
I'm gonna take a flat brush this is the
Charlotte Tilbury lip brush the lip
brush by Musa from s and then in this
inner corner I'm going to follow my tear
duct and kind of just elongate it this
way so you want to bring that shadow to
a point and blend it out I don't want to
be too much though because that's not
the point that we're going to make we're
going to make a continuation of the
liquid liner but with brown eye shadow
in a bit now I'm going back into rot and
I'm going to put that on the outer part
of the eye and I'm kind of connecting
this to the brown liner at the top
slowly have it go thinner as you go in
to the inner part of the eye just very
lightly grays like right underneath the
waterline you can see the waterline is
clean right now you want to keep most of
the focus on the outer part to keep with
that cat eye kind of look I'm just kind
of buff it out a little bit so it's not
too harsh we're going to go in with the
Mac 266 and I'm putting the rock eyes
shadow on the very tip of where the
brush becomes a point what you want to
do is go where your eyeliner would keep
going see the tear duct part of your eye
at the point I just put this into the
point very very slowly make a little
point at the tip of the waterline and
this actually makes your eye look more
cat eye light just adding that little
detail because see how this one's like
more round this one's going to now be
more pointy elongated it's going to give
you a sultry look do you see that how
pointy now my inner corner is it looks
way more feline like alright so now I'm
just going to go ahead and dust all this
excess powder off under the eyes I like
to do a little bit of this patting
motion so you don't disturb the
concealer too much I'm going to quickly
apply some mascara to my top lashes this
is the Tarte lights camera flashes
Scarah I'm just applying a quick base
because we're going to apply falsies I'm
going to apply my house of lashes like
conics we're gonna go land them straight
down lower lashes these are flutter
lashes petite I got to get real close
for this so
all right eye makeup done now it's the
fun part highlighting my favorite part
of doing my makeup is doing my eyebrows
and doing my highlight so I'm using the
Charlotte Tilbury film-star bronze &amp;amp;
Glow face sculpt and highlight this is
fair to medium I'm gonna use the
highlight part one time what I like
about this powder I used it the other
day it's not like a full glitter
highlight like oh my god let me blind
you this is more of like let me hit you
with that natural Sheen type of look
sometimes when I blend my highlight up
my Beauty Blender it looks more natural
when I take this and actually put it
down the bridge of my nose Cupid's bow
so I'm using that for my nose and the
Cupid's bow but I'm going to use a
different highlight for my cheekbones I
wanna use the over a blissful highlight
this one is like pretty intense put that
just on the high points right away Hall
all right it's time to go into our
bronzer I bought a brand new give me Sun
bronzer I noticed that I was breaking
out here alot and I was kind of going
through a phase where I wasn't washing
my brushes as often as I need to my
institution told me that face brushes
you have to clean every single day
especially because foundation brushes
powder brushes they get a lot of
bacteria and them and I think my other
give me Sun was just contaminated gross
and I know I could have disinfected it
but it was already on its last life so
I'm gonna go ahead and bronze the skin
I'm using a mac 135 brush to just kind
of give an overall bronzed look
hmmm bring that down your neck your
chest is another area that stays really
light for some weird reason I think I'm
good and bronzed now all right for blush
I'm using Sigma core DeRosa it's been
through some I'm gonna apply this
with this Sephora featherweight blending
because this blush is super pigmented
just to flush to the cheeks before I
apply my lip I'm just going to kind of
give myself a spritz I've got a brand
new mac fix+
 really shot out at me right now
like a shower I'm so used to my other
one that spits at me like a camel so for
my lips I'm gonna line them first with
the pick-up liner from the balm
cosmetics and this is in the shade a
cute one alright so I'm gonna be using
the faux fur liquid lipstick and this is
in Bellaire it's more so like a pinky
Mavi shade very pink actually alright so
that's it this is the finished makeup
look very sultry smoky Kat ie
very mommy super matte I really really
like how this makeup look turned out I
also really love this like elongated eye
technique if you guys try it out let me
know if it works for you I know it works
especially well for people with round
your eyes just keep the liner thicker on
the outer part then thinner on the
rounder part of your eye and then do
this little trick it's gonna give you
that Angelina Jolie eye
that's everything I hope you guys
enjoyed it and I'll see you my next
video bye
honestly like I can't move forward this
edge is not blended it really pisses me
off
hello mmm I just want to be too much you
know sure yeah
yes he doesn't want to be extra just
kidding haha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
