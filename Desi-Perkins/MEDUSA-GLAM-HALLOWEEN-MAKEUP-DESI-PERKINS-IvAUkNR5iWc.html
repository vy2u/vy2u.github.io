today's video is gonna be Halloween
tutorial on my take of Medusa those a
lot different stories about Medusa she's
a monster yeah but she's also this like
beautiful creature that lures you in and
then if you look at her in the eye she's
gonna turn you to stone I wanted to do
something Medusa chic and I took
inspiration from a few different things
I saw a runway show 2016 a Valentino
spring collection he had the models
walked down the runway with two gold
snakes that are coming out of the
foreheads and it was Sochi and then I
also found this incredible photography
makeup work I will link whatever I can
find from this image in the description
box down below if those two inspirations
had a baby with Lady Gaga from American
Horror Story the countess that is what
transpired here so if you guys want to
know how to go to this look then keep on
watching today I may be trying something
different
I bought these instant facelift I wanted
to give a very pulled back
look I watched many drag tutorials last
night but you know I can't do it as good
as them but I'm gonna try I am going to
take some rubbing alcohol and clean off
the area where I'm gonna be applying the
tape I saw a tutorial on YouTube of
somebody using a band-aid and string
also to do this at home if you don't
have it these already come with a sticky
side hopefully they're sticky enough if
you have other tape you could always use
pros-aide to stick it on this is really
good I hear it is the best for that hear
hear okay there's a good spot right
there so I'm just gonna stick that there
and then once we applied the bald cap
for the wig later we will snatch I found
that in most videos it goes on like
right where your hairline dips in to go
down you totally don't have to do this
part
you guys could skip it but
I just you know I think it's gonna add a
little drama to our hi I'm boss who
looked like a little webby though I was
gonna do lip cap last because I don't
want to look like a egghead the whole
time but we're about to just commit to
this look my ears are gonna hella pop
out you like the makeup application will
be better if I'm already buckled in here
this is what comes with the little lift
tapes that I got basically you just want
to put these through the hole and then
we're gonna snatch it back Cindy is
gonna come in and help snatch me back
because I cannot see what's happening
really yeah hit me
instant eye lift ladies and gentlemen
I feel epinoia Swanson just so I get an
idea of where everything's gonna go the
gold leaf I'm taking my Kelly Baker brow
highlight pencil I'm gonna feel my bones
out here I know that we want the shadow
to go this way and then have a swoop and
we want to take it back to further lift
the eye here so really follow the
anatomy of your eye and then we're
really gonna bring the black shadow here
wherever your eye bone curves the gold
leaf is gonna go there all the way
around and up next I'm just picking up
my Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil
and this is just a black color guys
could use anything and I'm gonna really
hit the base of my lashes with this
what's great about this eye look you're
blending doesn't have to be perfect
because we're gonna cover the crease
part with the gold leaves so it's a
super easy black smokey eye I just want
to have a little bit of a base down so
that the the eye is gonna be extra dark
here the lid and then as I apply that
I'm gonna take a synthetic brush this
one is by a city color and I'm just
gonna blend that out to evenly get it
across the whole lid and we're gonna
bring it into this inner corner just
messy I'm kind of just mapping out
things for myself and then I want it to
swoop upwards here I'm just taking a
makeup wipe to really
make sure I get that shape going maybe
even it to sharpen it next I'm picking
up a black shadow this one is from melt
cosmetics dark matter I just love how
dark this one is and I'm just gonna
apply that with a flat shader brush and
I'm gonna pack that over the liner base
that we laid down see how dark that is
whoa we want to give the illusion of a
deep set eyes so I'm taking it also
really far in I always have a blending
brush nearby this one is just a city
color very affordable blending brush
it's a nice and setec I'm just gonna as
I go blend it little by little that way
I know what's happening before I get too
crazy with the black eye shadow also
make sure we take that black shadow hug
the brow bone area so you see my brow
bones right there swooping around that
going straight to my temple this is also
one of those steps where you can put
tape here if it's easier for you and
then the tape will keep it really
straight or like I'm doing you could not
use tape but then get a makeup away and
do it like that going back into the dose
of colors brush I want to look forward
look straight look fierce look alive
pulling this towards your nose we're
gonna add black here along the area that
you would put an inner corner highlight
slightly blend it downwards
yes just taking a clean brush and kind
of buffing it downwards this way next
I'm gonna be taking uninterrupted by Mac
you could use any medium shade brown eye
shadow and I'm taking that on a blending
brush and I'm just gonna kind of swish
that right above the block here in this
inner corner it's not that it's gonna
show so much up there but it'll connect
to the nose area once we do our
foundation and everything moving on to
foundation I'm just gonna use my normal
shade foundation this is our money 7.5
you could always go lighter or you could
incorporate a little bit of green if you
want to to your look there goes run low
here I'm also gonna work the foundation
into my forehead and over this tape as
well next I'm applying some concealer on
the under eye I'm gonna be using my
Becca beige concealer blending that out
with a Beauty Blender and now I'm gonna
go ahead and set the under eyes I'm
gonna use a little bit of C 5 Mac Studio
Fix really lightly to tap on the under
eye taking an angled brush and the black
shadow I'm gonna run this on the outer
part of the lower lash line connecting
it to the wing at the top and then as I
get closer to the inner part of the eye
I'm gonna taper it so that it stays a
little less heavy towards the inner part
and I'm gonna take my black liner again
and just tight line the outside of the
waterline and fade it in just like we
did this shadow just taking the blending
brush and fading out the edges so it
isn't just like abruptly stop now it's
time for the gold leaf I picked this up
at the craft store Michaels to be exact
you have to make sure that you use some
sort of tweezers to pick the gold leaf
because it sticks to everything what I
did last night was I'm taking the duo
lash glue I'm gonna take some of this on
the back of my hand and I'm just gonna
lightly coat this on to the brow bone
first now with the tweezers I'm going to
go into the gold leaf piece by piece and
stick it on so I'm using the tweezers to
pick it up place it and then the spoolie
to kind of press it down and this is
probably the hardest part which isn't
super hard it's just more time-consuming
so first we're going to cover the brow
bone and then we'll move up from there
I forgot to mention it but the reason I
love the idea of these gold flakes is
because the snakes are gold and it kind
of looks like the snake is shedding its
skin on to Medusa so this will resemble
snake skin so now you see why the black
eyeshadow didn't need to blend all that
well because here we are covering
everything and then afterwards just
press it all in so that it flattens it
all out and then we're going to go ahead
and do the same exact thing to at the
other side I'm gonna be picking up the
Stila Magnificent medal and I'm gonna
apply that in the inner corner and I'm
also gonna run that on this part of the
eye kind of putting it on in chunks
because I want it to also look like
little chunks of gold leaf now we're
going to move into on touring of the
first we're gonna contour referring back
to Lady Gaga American Horror Story
because who doesn't want to be her in
American Horror Story I freakin love her
and that so I'm just gonna take a
synthetic brush this one is iconic
London and my hoola bronzer and I'm
gonna start to define the tip of the
nose here and then also the bottom kind
of like really square off the tip of the
nose there taking a clean brush I'm just
gonna feather out those edges I'm also
going to take that bronzing powder and
really define the Cupid's bow I'm
actually gonna use a little smaller
brush for that little Real Techniques
brush and really define this part of the
lip also taking that under the lips here
to create a shadow and make our lips
look fuller and then I'm also gonna do
the cheekbones taking this japonesque
brush you want to follow the line that
you made with the liner or the shadow so
for this look we're gonna slightly bring
the contour down because she's really
sucked in now we want to bring out some
highlights and over exaggerate the
highlights and the cheekbones and on the
forehead and nose I'm gonna be using the
Monica dark powder this is just a
regular face powder and c3 so it's
pretty light like Chris B uses this
all the time and I'm abusing an iconic
London flat-ish brush kind of placing
that on the tops of the cheekbones
really making those cheekbones pop I'm
also going to take that right here just
in the center of the forehead and down
the bridge of the nose I'm just gonna
put it actually up top right here and
then at the very tip too
I'm gonna go in with artist couture and
this is or FFA's collaboration with them
highlight called slay Lonnie and it has
more of a yellow undertone so I feel
it's gonna be perfect for this just
spritz my brush with a little six-plus
and just put that on the high parts of
the cheekbone so I skip the white powder
on this area if you're gonna apply a
highlight highlight I'm just gonna take
a little bit of the lash glue and add
tiny bit more gold Lea if I want to put
some on my Cupid's bow and then just
kind of trickling down my nose here that
is a lot harder than it looked
alright what are we doing for the lip I
want to keep the lips pretty muted
because I want everything to be like
gold bronzy monochromatic so I'm gonna
be using Mac a girl's got needs this
lipstick is nice because it really like
blanks out the lips mm-hmm maybe we
could get a little slay Lonnie up in
there just a dust of it in the center
mm-hmm that's we're here
I'm also forgot that we need to put a
little gold leaf aka snakeskin coming
down the sides of our neck for that I
just put some pieces and then rub it all
on because it actually stays pretty well
if you just spritz a little fix+ and
then add it on here I didn't want to
take that chance on the eyebrows because
you do want to that part to last all
night but it's like a few flake off here
it's not a serious you know if at the
end of this tutorial you don't hate gold
leaf then you're doing something wrong
and then I'm gonna hit the collar bones
of course and the shoulders with a
little sleigh Lani as well if there's
any time you can go crazy why not no
oh yes oh yes
honestly these artists Couture
highlights are like so bangin for the
body especially because you could just
look at that I just want you to know my
my filming area is a nightmare with like
gold leaf and highlight everywhere I
feel like now that I added all that
highlight I could just like add a little
more here to like tie it all in just a
little want to go crazy I mean I already
went crazy it's too late huh
I feel like this all would look so much
better if I didn't have a wig cap on
right now but we're about to snatch so
I'm not gonna put false lashes okay
because I feel like this is very strong
this way without the lashes and I don't
want the lashes to go up into the gold
leaf I just want to be lash this but if
you feel like you want to then do it
girl
oh boy I'm also gonna apply fangs
scarecrow custom things I'm gonna apply
the fangs off camera there's no the
follow directions and hope for the best
be back all right you two hangers are
gonna be a little harder to talk with I
blamed myself so now what we're gonna do
is we're gonna apply the wig okay
just note it if you have these fangs
just what you're gonna sound like often
at night okay so apparently these are a
mold and I can put them on later so
we'll do that we'll reconvene so I don't
sound like that for the rest of the time
this way was custom colored by Pravana
to get me that Lady Gaga American Horror
Story look okay I'm obsessed with how
she looked so we're gonna pop this on
alright so now we have our wig hon now
we're gonna apply snakes so I painted
this snake with my mehron face paint
I glued clips to the bottom with felt
that matches the wig and I bought these
snakes at Target I mean uh Michaels so I
want the snake to come down right there
where the gold leaf is so I'm just gonna
put the clip in I've added the snake so
you can add as many snakes or as little
snakes as you want I just wanted to keep
it minimalistic but still give the vibe
that like Hello Medusa now what I'm
gonna do is apply my little
handpiece but before I do that I want to
kind of give my hand a cool effect by
applying black shadow to the fingertips
take a little flat blending brush go
into the beds of my nails and just kind
of fade it down it doesn't have to be
perfect I think it'll give it a cool
effect it's so fun taking all this off
afterwards people are asking me what I'm
gonna be for Halloween and I'm like you
know by the time I'm done filming
Halloween videos I'm kind of like what
then we're gonna go ahead and put these
on these definitely add the countess
vibe I love these little hand pieces who
the claws these are from Etsy I'll link
them down below look at this are you
scared venca so that's it right I'm
gonna put the fangs on but I cannot do
the fangs before I do my intro outro so
I'm gonna do it for the end shots if you
see pictures on the gram and I'm wearing
this wig it's because I decided to
change it last minute I think I like
this one a little bit better this is
just another rubber snake from the toy
store wrapped it around my neck painted
it gold I think it adds a lot maybe you
could wear one of those like gold bando
tops make it very sheshe chic and like
something high-waisted I don't know
oughta boost the like a cat yeah this is
the alternate wig thought I'd share it
with you guys let me know what you think
should I do a little slow Mona so you
can see really really be able to feel it
out I think we should let's do it ready

will turn you to stone okay thank you
