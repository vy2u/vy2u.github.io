a happy Halloween
October's here super excited about it I
decided to do this skull face thingy I
want it to be melting skin duck feet
coming off and I wanted to incorporate a
skull because skulls are super original
just kidding
you got your skin melting you got your
skull glamorous side you got your your
edges not late at all but you know what
it's fine let's go ahead and get started
all right so we're going to start off
with the glam side of the face I'm just
going to fill in my brows and I want
everything to look really sharp and
clean so I'm making my brows look that
way as well and then of course you want
to put down an eyeshadow base I'm using
Mac soft ochre and I'm going to apply
that under the brow to sharpen it and
then also all over the lid and crease
and just blend that out next you want to
make sure to set your base so I'm using
Mac's Blanc type all over the lid crease
and brow bone because this is also going
to be our lid color as well next you
want to apply your transition shade so
any warm brown color this is burnt
orange by anastacio Beverly Hills and
I'm just going to take that into my
upper crease on the outer part of the
eye and also take it all the way to the
inner corner to darken that I'm going to
be using carroty shadow in the shade
safeword and this is just going to make
it pop a little bit more
now I'm going to move on to the wing
before I deepen the crease even more
just to give me a better guide and I'm
using my Inglot gel liner to create a
very sharp dramatic wing gotta work it
out work it out see I start thin and
then slowly you just kind of build it up
there we go
I'm going to take a pencil brush with
some black eyeshadow now and connect the
outer part of the wing to the outer
crease area and then take a blending
brush after you do the harsh line just
to kind of smoke it out a little bit
make sure it's nice and blended put on
some lashes these are a knockout by
house of lashes and then picking up a
white eyeliner pencil I'm kind of
bouncing around here I decided to just
give myself the outline that I want of
the drips and also just where the skin
turns into the skull and I use a white
pencil because it's easy if you mess up
boom wipe it off boom
wipe it off change your mind at any time
and it's not a big deal which I did a
few times I'm going to go ahead after
that and apply foundation to my more
glam side you can do this part before
the white pencil too might be a little
bit easier but you know I was on the fly
with this video so I'm just going with
whatever my mind tells me at the time
and then I'm just going to apply some
concealer this is the NARS creamy
concealer and ginger and then setting it
with the Laura Mercier translucent
powder going back into the burnt orange
shadow I'm going to apply that on the
lower lash line and then taking some
white eyeliner I'm going to open up the
eyes with this and continue to smoke out
that lower lash line with some black eye
shadow as well so in a second here I'm
about to have a change of heart
I really thought I wanted that like more
doll look with the white but then I
decided I wanted a more smoky look so I
took the white liner off and switched it
out for a black kohl liner just to make
it look a little bit more smoky so that
it would match up with the skull side
better once I was finished taking the
same lashes that I use on the top lashes
I'm flipping them upside down I cut them
up and I stuck them on the lower lash
line I've been into my mehron face paint
palette which I'll link down below I'm
going to pick up some paint I you know
started with gray but I think starting
with
black is just as good you can put the
darkest color in any curves like you see
here I decided to go in the black and
then I use my finger to smudge it out
just makes it easy to blend for me this
way so that it looks like I have depth
and all those curves you always want to
put the darkest shade in the curves of
your drips and then lightly gradiate it
out so the center looks more Hollow you
just have more depth and it actually
looks like those drips are coming off of
your face alright and I actually decided
to keep this part in because I didn't
really like the way the drips were
looking I decided I wanted to make them
a little bit thinner so I went in and
outlined them with a small detail brush
and made them just a little bit thinner
the second time around I kept that part
in because it's real life and sometimes
you don't like what you create
especially we need to practice the video
before you film it this is just me on
the go so I'm now making them a little
bit thinner keeping a makeup wipe next
to me just in case there's something
that I don't like easy to wipe away and
then do it again and then fill them in
just like I showed you the first time I
just didn't want to do that step again
taking that little detail brush I'm
going to fill in the nostrils of the
skull and kind of put little dots around
your drips so that it looks like your
skin is slowly deteriorating so you have
like little holes of skin missing
missing flesh taking a black kohl liner
and I'm going to start working on the
skull side of the eye filling in the
waterline and making sure that no lash
line peeks through once I apply this you
can cover your brow if you want I did
with some concealer because my brows are
really light or you could just paint
black right over your brows if you have
thicker brows and you don't feel like
covering them we're just going to fill
in the whole eye with black face paint
and set it with black eyeshadow and you
can see there that I left a little bit
of flesh peeking through because I'm
going to use white to highlight that
later for more depth on the eye socket
now I'm taking my white face paint and
basically filling in the whole skull
side I like to really start with my
cheekbones and
giving myself that skeletal shape and
that way I have a better idea without
using black where the skeleton part of
the face will be and then anywhere that
there's hollows like my cheekbones where
I usually contour I know that that's
going to be black so as you guys can see
I'm not filling that in with the white
while I'm here I'm just going to go
ahead and add a little white highlight
to the center of these hollows overheal
now I'm taking a detail brush and
further sketching out my skeletal shape
I just find it's easier to do this with
white than with black that way like I
said earlier if you mess up you can just
wipe it away and you're good to go so
once you know that you have your
skeletal shape going on you just want to
take the white face paint and kind of
make sure everything is super white and
fill everything in nice and neat and now
that I did that I can safely go in with
the black knowing that I have my shape
down already so I'm just going to kind
of fill in all that negative space so
you know you want to fill in Dee temple
and then also the mouth area here I'm
just filling it all in with black and
this part you just want to make dark and
then fade it towards the teeth you know
it's easy to use your finger for that
just kind of take your finger and fade
the black into this teeth area here and
now for the teeth I'm just following the
shape of my own teeth with a fine detail
brush and black face paint I watched a
crispies video because she makes teeth
looks so easy if you want a better teeth
description go to her video I still
can't get it right but I tried my best
so definitely check hers out she's like
queen of skulls and with very little
face paint on my brush I decided to give
myself more of a tooth like shape so in
my mind I was thinking her she kiss her
she kiss her she kiss
trying to draw that out as my tooth
shape and then filling in the gaps
between the teeth with some black eye
shadow to give it more depth now that
you have the base of the skull it really
comes to life with shadowing so look at
a picture of a skull and kind of try to
mimic vegetables shadows with any matte
brown eyeshadow that you have I took a
pencil brush first and then really went
in with a blending brush to gradiate all
those edges make the eye socket look
like it's pop
make the jawline look like it's popping
out just always have a picture of
reference nearby and it makes it so much
easier because right now our skull is
really flat and it doesn't look that
exciting but once you start shadowing it
with an eye shadow it really brings it
to life and that's what makes us all
look really cool so just look at a
picture and try to follow as best as you
can and also make sure you shadow
anywhere where the skin meets the skull
because you want depth there as well and
then lastly I'm going back into the
hollow that I left over here in the eye
and hitting it with some white facepaint
same thing with the nose area now it's
time for the fun part this is the mehron
3d flesh gel you're going to want to
heat this up make sure you read the
directions all you're going to do is
pour the gel along all the drips that
you've made yourself so where you see
the skin looks like it's dripping that's
where I concentrated the majority of the
gel and then also put it randomly in
certain areas once I was done it's
really all like what you see and what
you like and how the drips are falling
but it's so easy honestly this side of
the face that makes it look really cool
is probably the easiest part the skull
to me was the hardest part but this side
is really actually pretty fun and easy
and you don't have to worry about the
gel because it dries and once it dries
you can talk you can you know do
whatever you want and it's just gonna
stay there so it's comfortable is what
I'm saying and just a warning you might
want to have a towel on your lap when
you're doing this because it pretty much
just got everywhere everywhere and
that's it guys that's pretty much it you
just have to wait for it to dry alright
guys so that is it for this tutorial I
really hope you enjoyed the video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you did
and all
you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
