for today's video I thought we would do
something fun I saw on Instagram a face
chart by milk 14:22 and I thought it was
so stunning beautiful it has like this
winter wonderland like fantasy feel I
think this would be really cute for
maybe in New Year's kind of like a take
on a masquerade mask this is a really
talented artist and all their face
charts are like incredible you guys
should check that account out I will put
it right over here I want to do
something fun and different and shake
things up a little so this is my
recreation of that face chart and if you
guys are interested then keep on
watching let's see here I'm gonna start
off by going into the it's my it's my
ray-ray and BH Cosmetics palette I'm
gonna be taking mousse which is this
shade right here I've already applied a
shape tape as my eyeshadow base and then
I set it with a light powder now we're
just gonna go into that sunset shade and
I'm taking my Mac 2 to 4 this girl has a
lot more lid space and upper brow bone
space so I'm like hoping the rhinestones
fit here we're just gonna go ahead and
hit this into the crease get our shape
going and this was gonna be our
transition shade alright so we applied
that color first love that shade mousse
really really like the way it blended
out that was a good color now we're
gonna go into a more deep shade of brown
this is oak from the matte and metals
palette Kat Von D really like this Brown
just Pat doesn't have like a super warm
or a super cool undertone it's just kind
of like neutral we're gonna go ahead and
use a Smith to 3/5 brush we apply the
other shade into the crease and upper
crease and now we're gonna get it one
time in the crease really deepen it up I
love how simple this makeup look is
looking at the chart but it just looks
so stunning there's really not a lot to
the eye look just the crystals that make
it look so good I'm gonna keep applying
that until it's as rich as you want it
so now that we deepen up the crease I'm
going
take a little bit of tart shape tape and
medium right he'll on a flat concealer
brush I'm gonna just carve out the lip
space and this is gonna clean up the
crease and sharpen it up and also clean
up the lid from any eye shadow that may
have fallen boom
usually I take it only halfway but I'm
gonna take it all the way no I'm gonna
take the suede color right here from the
matte metal pellet and I'm gonna put
that on the lid from the middle to the
inside I'm trying to make my lid space
look bigger and then we're gonna go back
with our Mac 217 actually gonna take
this color which is uninterrupted by mac
cosmetics swirl that on the outer V here
I'm actually switched to a just a flat
brush to pack it on once I have that
faded into the lid color I'm going to
apply the dark color that we applied in
the crease which was oak on the outer
outer part of the beef blend it into the
uninterrupted color by Mac really just
accentuate the eye and with this I just
like to do patting motions and Pat the
colors into each other so that they're
like nice and blended it also cheek
blending brush and feather out these
edges too I'm going back into
uninterrupted you could actually even
just use the color you first used in the
crease the one that I use from it's my
rayray Paulo I could use that to just
make it look nice and smoky I'm gonna
take a little bit of bone I'm not gonna
lie I kind of already did it off camera
side forgot I wasn't rolling but put it
on the brow bone to like really make it
highlight and pop and then I'm also
gonna take a little bit of that and
place it in the center of my head like
right where your pupil is just follow
that alright now it's time for the fun
stuff we're gonna go in with some
crystals now these I have right here
which I feel are perfect for
the like snowflake vibe that we got
going on these were actually sent to me
by MAC Cosmetics they're just like
little stickers and I also have these
crystals from Michael's their little
sparse key crystals that you can get
from craft section so either one works
to place the crystals I'm gonna use lash
glue just using House of lash glue duo
glue is really good for this as well
it's not as sticky as house of lashes
glue but I'm going in all the way now
I'm not gonna lie to you guys applying
wear in stones is like not that easy
alright so I'm just gonna put a little
bit of glue on the back of one of the
crystals so look straight place it right
above the crease okay that's good enough
we're gonna go with that no I'm going to
the other one prepping it as well just
glue these crystals are bigger and the
drawing has a lot more space above the
crease then I do so obviously it's gonna
look a little different
stead of putting another crystal above
it I'm just gonna do little dots with
the white from the makeup forever flash
palette we have a new brush here from
Elsie cosmetics this has little stars on
the sides that's getting extra advanced
here I'm gonna need a really fine brush
this gives me like when Stefania vibes
so I'm starting with just an X then I'm
gonna add the one line through the X to
make a star I'm using a paint brush from
Michael's I'm gonna do my other star
little X
and then there's two dots on the sides
of the eye so I'm just going to use the
white with a little bit of the silver
which is in the make up forever flash
palette I'm gonna dot it a little
daughter so festive okay I'm gonna go
ahead and do the other eye whoo we're
gonna go ahead and apply some iconic
lights by house of lashes I'm just gonna
trim these a little bit cuz my eye is a
little bit smaller than this slash now
we're gonna move on to foundation before
we finish everything else I feel like
every foundation I have has gotten too
dark for me because I lost any tan that
I had had usually foundations a lit but
this one's so dark now we're gonna be
wearing the Armani luminous silk and 7.5
so we're gonna go for no I'm gonna apply
that with my LC cosmetics beauty sponge
if you ever feel like the Beauty Blender
takes up a lot of your product just
apply it with a brush first is the fenty
brush evenly apply it all over with that
and then blend it out with the sponge
I'm so mad that the days end so soon
because I love to get makeup pictures in
natural daylight I just feel like the
studio light doesn't show the glitter or
like any type of sparkle and I'm already
running out of time it's like 3
oh my god it's 4 o'clock I'm already
doomed struggle so now we're gonna apply
some concealer I'm using my Becca
luminous silk concealers then I'll grab
a little bit of shape shape tan sand and
I apply that right here blend it out
another thing I want to say about this
blender is that I know this sharp edge
looks like oh I'm scared I'm gonna poke
myself in the eye but it is so flimsy
and soft it's like the perfect pressure
to where you could get the side of the
nose but it would not even if I just jam
this in my eyes still wouldn't hurt it's
like really really soft even though it
looks so pointy
all right I'm gonna go ahead and set my
under eye with some Laura Mercier
translucent sugar down here also just
down the bridge of the nose then I'm
gonna take just a regular powder brush
I'm actually gonna take the LCF ten
brush I'm just gonna Pat that into the
forehead a little bit translucent powder
they're just kind of a light dusting I'm
gonna dust this off under the eyes all
right so now we can finish the under
eyes I'm gonna be taking my mr. right by
the balm cosmetics look how much powder
I have on my arm and I'm gonna be taking
this and applying it on the outer part
of the eye so lashline and waterline I'm
gonna take a pencil brush before we go
any further and buff that out and then
applying a little bit more you play like
liners or anything the color black
honestly you just want to go in steps
because it's easier to just like build
up then go ham and then it looks crazy
I'm so upset right now that I have no do
you light anymore like I can't even tell
you I'm gonna have to speak to the sun's
manager let them know that this whole
like Sun going down early thing is just
not really working out for me now we're
gonna finish off the eyes and the inner
corner has a highlight so I'm going back
into the makeup forever white and I'm
gonna do like a hat like a little sea
let me grab a little pencil brush and
blend that out a little bit I'm just
taking a dose of colors one we're gonna
take this and do a little star
now we're gonna move on to the little
snowflake that's in the center here and
I'm just gonna use I wish this snowflake
that I already had was smaller but its
massive so many is one of little
snowflake petals this would be really
pretty for New Year's actually oh okay
so we've got that on we're just gonna
pretend that's a snowflake and then I'm
gonna go back into one of the little
sake crystals here I remember when I was
saying this was supposed to be so easy
but actually gluing these crystals is a
pain in the ass so I'm going to do one
more dot up top a little X's here okay
and then I'm gonna do another star right
under this snowflake we have more
rhinestones under the eyes just doing
two dots on the side and one below whoo
the hard part is done I'm gonna go into
the BH Cosmetics and it's my ray-ray
palette and take the highlight here
which is called moonlight we're gonna
use that to highlight the nose right
here for the lips I feel like the
perfect gloss is gonna be the fenty
gloss it just like looks like the exact
same color before we do the lips I'm
gonna highlight the Cupid's bow with the
makeup forever flash palette in the
white color that we've been using for
all the stars I'm drawing a line and
then blending it out and I'm actually
also going to take some hoola bronzer
and I'm gonna deepen the Cupid's bow dip
with this so that it looks like my
Cupid's bow projects more see that I
just made it look like a deep swimming
pool you go swimming in there looks like
you could get cereal out of there I'm
also gonna use that since we're here
with the bronzer I haven't bronzed yet
there's a heavy contour going on with
this drawing so I'm taking this Mac 140s
brush a little bit on the forehead I
don't know what I'm gonna tell my dad
when he comes picks me up for dinner I'm
like hey time for the lips
Fenty gloss over top of that I'm gonna
hit it with some over-the-top dose of
colors does the xkt gloss then we're
gonna do the same thing
the white makeup forever paint and we're
just gonna give it a little highlight
see how it looks like what now
my brother said I should highlight my
cheekbones so are you satisfied yes okay
so how'd I do that's it we're done I
