today's video is going to be a mini haul
chitchat just one on one really get to
hang out and talk I'm really hyper today
just warning you guys I think I'm kind
of on a high from like my last video you
guys are amazing oh yeah by the way I
almost forgot to tell you guys there's
also gonna be a giveaway attached to
this video at the end means you have to
just stay here and watch me until the
end you could skip but that would be
shade but you could but I wouldn't want
to I did a little online shopping at
Sephora recently and I thought I would
share with you guys I also got something
for my pops for Father's Day so maybe
it'll give you guys an idea for
something for your dad the reason I have
shopped online at Sephora is because I
went through Ebates and I've talked to
you guys about you babes before in
previous videos it's amazing if you
don't already have it you need it what
you Bates is it's one of the largest
cashback websites super legit when you
go shopping they actually give you money
back whereas if you go shopping in a
let's just use Sephora as an example if
I go into Sephora and I buy all these
things I don't get anything back I just
get my stuff and my received and that's
it if you shop Sephora through Ebates
then you get a certain percentage of
money back right now they're having a
promotion for eight percent cashback
every store has a different percent at
different times but right now it's like
eight percent which is really good and I
got money back for everything that I
purchased which is awesome so stores
like Sephora Macy's Nordstrom Nasty Gal
they all are on Ebates and out misguided
anytime you're a new member and you sign
up for Ebates you get a ten dollar bonus
and then anytime you refer people to
sign up you also get money back as well
as getting money back or all your
purchases that you make on all the
websites the giveaway that I have at the
end of this video is also hosted by
Ebates they gave me I'm telling you
right now because I couldn't wait
anyways they gave you five $100 gift
cards to give away to you guys I know I
told you I was gonna have to make you
wait till the end but just in case some
of you skipped you missed it do you see
what I did there so all the giveaway
details will be in the description box
down below so right now from the 7th to
20th you can get a lot of cash back from
a lot of stores because it is Father's
Day coming up and that's also as long as
the giveaway entries will be taken so
that's how long June 7th to 20th be on
the lookout if you are looking
or something for your dad or you know
what if you're just wanting to talk for
yourself lots of cash back right now so
with that said let's go ahead and go
into what I got so starting off with
this first item it's a perfume I have
been hunting for perfumes like crazy
recently because just decided I want to
wear perfume and I would like to have a
scent that people like No ooh that's her
I haven't found my scent yet but I'm
trying really hard right now really
inspired to smell good because her oh Sh
smells fabulous like I'll never smell
like her because I think it's just her
skin this is one of the perfumes I
picked up I don't want to butcher the
name at Telia Cologne actually tested
this out in store this is a very
specific scent like I have a really
weird fragrance taste I guess because
I'm sensitive to strong smells I can't
do anything super potent floral I get a
headache I'm really really sensitive
which sucks but this is like a really
light grapefruit scent I know that's
weird
but it smells so citrusy and fresh and I
love the weight grapefruit smells like
anytime there's a grapefruit lotion I
get it so that's what this smells like
I wish perfumes weren't always like so
hard to read different languages this is
Cologne absolu pomelo parodies I will
put it in text right here because I
don't know what it is it smells like
grapefruit so if you're a citrusy type
of person and you like those kinds of
smells it's so fresh you know that smell
when you cut into an orange and you get
the citrus that's pretty much what this
smells like but just the grapefruit
scent it's not super overpowering it's
just light and nice I also got another
perfume because like I said I'm trying
to find my scent
I'm buying a lot of perfumes right now
hold please moving on to the next
perfume that I purchased this is called
commodity gold this one smells like
vanilla like just so delicious this is
the bottle I'm not like a huge brand
person like I don't know either of these
brands I just get what I like by scent
so I'm not sure if you guys have heard
of this but it smells delicious it's
like a true vanilla scent I'm actually
thinking that I'm gonna mix the two
scents because I feel like citrus and
vanilla is gonna be so good
I plan that's why I got both of them oh
this smells so good if you like sweet
smells if you want to smell like a
bakery which I do all times
this is amazing I wish you guys could
smell it through the camera it's not a
super sugary vanilla scent it's a really
warm I'm gonna say round I don't know
what that means but it sounds correct
next I picked up some face masks face
masks are one of my favorite things the
ones that are like the sheet masks you
guys always see me wearing them on
snapchat this one is the sake
brightening hydrogel mask I get anything
brightening because I do tend to get
spots every time I get a breakout like
the spot will linger on my face forever
I also get darkness around the mouth so
anything that has brightening properties
I'm a huge fan of but it says it
brightens firms firms and hydrate so
this is a great mask for anybody who has
drier skin who tends to get pigmentation
tightening is good for everybody I mean
I don't know who wouldn't want to be
like snatched I like to use these more
towards the end of the rough week when
I've just been through a lot and I'm
just tired my skin looks haggard and
then the next one that I got is also a
hydrating mask when it comes to these
masks I really like hydrating because I
tend to use other masks like the glam
glow and those are a little bit more
drying they get everything dried up like
all your breakouts and stuff so they are
drying that's why when it comes to sheet
masks I personally like to pick
hydrating ones sometimes I'll even do a
drying a more drying mask and then
immediately after do the hydrating one
because I feel like it's just locking
the moisture back into my skin
this one is dr. jart I've actually never
tried this brand of hydrating mask
pretty much the same thing it helps with
redness and dryness so if you have
redness in your skin this will be a good
mask for you oh and all of these only
have one mask unfortunately alright so
the next item is the Becca shimmering
skin Perfector I could be totally wrong
but I'm pretty sure I was watching Karen
oh snapchat and she was saying that Jay
kis had told her that this was amazing
to wear on the skin when you're not
wearing foundation could be totally
wrong could maybe not even have been
this product but I decided to get
anyways because that's what I remembered
you guys don't follow J kisses she has
like phenomenal skin she doesn't wear
foundation she does tutorials without
foundation and her skin looks like
phenomenal she has no discoloration like
nothing it's beautiful so I decided to
give it a try what this is is just a
shimmering it says it's a shimmering
skin perfecter and I guess that's
exactly what it is so here's a little
bit this is the more bronze II shade
because I'm a little bit more tan I
didn't want to get one that was too
light because it might make me look ashy
this shade is topaz as you guys can see
on my hand it's just giving it a really
nice glow a really nice sheen it's not
glittery at all it's just really dewy
and glowy blowing can you see how good
my hand looks healthy dewy this one
looks lackluster so I'm gonna give it a
try see how it goes
hopefully it doesn't highlight
imperfections that's something I don't
want like highlight pores so I will keep
you guys posted on this product through
my snapchat where I'm always talking
about things like a little bit more real
time so if you guys don't follow me
there did I have to say okay so next up
we have the Guerlain terracotta bronzer
hopefully I pronounced that right
because I always pronounce it wrong this
terracotta bronzer is very very well
talked about Shayla uses this she swears
by it
I've actually purchased one before but I
think it was too dark for me it's the
darkest shade I got the darkest one
thinking like yeah that's perfect I want
to be like super bronzed and I think it
was just like bronzer helmet for me so I
decided to give it another go and try
shade oh hell no the mirror just fell
out Guerlain I try to give you a chance
right now and you're playing me so hard
right now so hard I'm gonna keep this in
the video because you guys need to know
what's going on with me that's not cool
but okay okay okay
well the bronze are still intact still
gonna give it a shot because I mean I
don't really need the mirror but I'm
just like
Katy's here Katy is here but anyways
this is shade oh five and I feel like
it's gonna work a lot better on my
skintone yeah that's really pretty
okay it's really pretty still even
though the mirror played me perfect
shade you imagine that I tried wearing a
darker one than this it just didn't work
out for my skintone at all the only
thing I'm already not liking is it has a
strong Laurel scent almost like
lipsticks used to have back in the day
when you used to borrow them from your
mom that's the kind of scent this has
the next thing I got was from pat Bundy
I have a few of their liquid lipsticks
definitely did not have this shade and I
was like I need it this is the shade a
go-go Kat Von D has like amazing
products and everything I've tried from
them has been really good this is a
bright bright orange liquid lipstick BAM
it's just right bright orange and when
summer comes along bright orange is one
of my favorite colors to wear like any
Reds that have oranges in them I'm
excited to try it you guys are looking
for liquid lipsticks this formula is
great I love it so we'll see how that a
go goes oh my god this is so weird Kat
Von D just liked my photo as I was
talking about Kat Von D liquid lipstick
it's fate
the next thing I have is from buxom and
it's a cinnamon matte sinful cinnamon
lipstick it's almost similar to the
color I'm wearing right now actually I'm
kind of into these like brownie
cinnamony nudes right now let's see my
swatch game is not as strong as Katie's
is get a little bitch I'm talking shit
about you over you actually I'm giving
you compliments color it looks very
similar to the color that I'm wearing
right now which is very strange but
amazing because I mixed colors to get
this color see how it smells mmm smells
like cake oh and the packaging it's
magnetic I love magnetic packaging I
will let you guys know how this goes but
it looks amazing I really love the color
I'm so happy that so many brands are
coming out with matte lipsticks because
I'm such a fan of matte lipstick lastly
I have my Father's Day gift
I can't open it it's the only problem
about showing you guys but I decided to
get my dad a cologne he's also not a big
like proof cologne perfume where just
like I'm not so I felt
we both should start smelling good this
is the Dior salvo so I know nothing
about men's cologne Stephan still wears
like aqua di o because that's the scent
that I remember from like high school
and I love that scent so that's the only
scent that I'm like really aware of as
far as men's fragrances I decided to
take a chance on this one I did smell it
in store and it smelled really just like
manly my dad's like a man's man he's
very like I got him a manly scent
hopefully he likes it the only thing
about getting perfume for people is you
just never know but at least he'll
pretend to like it in front of me and
that's all that counts
all right guys so that's everything
