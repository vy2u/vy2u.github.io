E and colour-pop Abdullah lipgloss yes
alright guys let's go ahead and get
started I wanted to do a favorites video
because I've had a lot of favorites
accumulating over here and things that I
like have to share with you guys it's
very importante we are just gonna go
ahead and get right into it the very
first thing I'm gonna talk about
probably my most favorite item in this
whole collection of things because let
me tell you it is a life-changing
product for me and it is the Olay
Henriksen balancing force oil control
toner first of all I don't ever use
toner it's one of those things that I'm
kind of singing
I don't want toner story behind this
toner is we were traveling in Australia
and Steven and John both were gonna run
out so Katie and I were like oh my god
can you please stop at Sephora we both
need something I needed something for my
breakouts cuz my skin was acting crazy
and I had red bumps everywhere for a
while my skin has been on and off just
like breaking out really crazy and then
it'll clear up and then break out really
crazy I even saw a dermatologist I feel
like the medication he gave me was like
way too strong and it just kind of like
messed up my skin actually so I stopped
using that Steven came home with this
from Sephora and he's like I don't know
I just I think it would work and has
salicylic acid I thought it would work
for my breakouts and stuff so when he
first showed it to me I was like a
little hesitant and then I used it and I
loved the way it smelled it felt like a
spa has like a cooling sensation to it
and I was like wow this feels really
nice so then I just started using it
because it felt good like it just felt
so calming and soothing and I noticed
all the irritation on my skin started to
go away my skin has gone from day to
night since using this it went from a
new breakout every single day to nothing
and everything is cleared up and my
pores look smaller and everything just
looks incredible and I'm just like so
thankful for this toner it says it's a
green fusion complex neem seed oil
salicylic acid and AJ's something I
can't pronounce something else I can't
pronounce that's pretty much it that's
all another thing I want to say about
toner is that since I've been using this
I realized how much makeup I left on my
skin I would wash my face really really
well use a makeup wipe everything and I
thought my face was clean when I went to
bed because I've just went through so
much to take all my makeup off but when
I take
this and I clean my skin off with it I
see so much left over makeup dirt oil
that I just never knew was sitting on my
skin at night and now I realized it has
been so this has just been amazing and
to complement this I have another
favorite that I have discovered and it
is don't-don't-don't large silk wipes
this is like my substitute for cotton
pads
I hate cotton I've told you guys this
before I have a phobia of cotton it
freaks me out like not shirt cotton but
like cotton balls cotton swabs cotton
pads I will never touch them I cannot
handle touching them I will not and I
just recently found out that Ellen has
the same phobia so I feel totally okay
about it because Ellen is my she's my
woman okay and she doesn't like hot
neither so it's not that weird we
ordered these on Amazon and these have
just been so incredible for taking off
my eye makeup and they're massive I like
cut them so that they're just like
little squares and then I also use it to
tone my skin my neck my chest I get
everything off and when I look at it
afterwards I see so much leftover stuff
and it's so satisfiying and also makes
me feel so much cleaner at night so I'm
telling you guys these two things I
don't know maybe if you guys are having
similar situations where you're just
having like a lot of breakouts pop up it
might work for you and if anything
doesn't work for your breakouts it's
definitely gonna keep your skin a lot
cleaner than you might think it is if
you don't already use toner I'm telling
you that was probably the most important
thing I couldn't share with you guys
next we're gonna move on to two lip
colors that I have been loving this
month these two lip colors are both red
and I couldn't decide which one I liked
better so they're Thai for me they're
kind of just in two different price
ranges so I thought I'd share both of
them this is the color pop I love set ie
ultra matte lip in Arriba and this is
the Fenty Beauty stunnin lip shade so
both of them are so nice honestly when I
tried Arriba I just felt like wow this
is the perfect red it has a really nice
application the formulation is great
it's not too drying it's that red color
that makes your teeth really really
white which everybody loves that there's
nothing that I would change about this
it's
fect that the other lip color which is a
Rihanna's Fenty lipstick in the shade
Stunna this color is also just like that
classic beautiful red it's a little bit
brighter here is everybo and then
honestly I'm like damn there's pretty
freakin similar Arriba has a little bit
more of like that blue undertone that's
gonna make your teeth super super white
Donna still has that blue undertone but
it's just like a little less blue but
they're very very similar I also really
love the applicator on the Fenty one
it's like easy to apply it without a lip
liner I haven't really worn a lip liner
with it I just kind of go in which I
usually don't do I will say the only
thing about the fenty one is that it
does when you take it out of the bottle
the the wand has like a lot a lot of
product on it so you kind of have to
scrape it off before you go in because
it's very very thin the formula this one
doesn't dry down all the way whereas
like the everybo lip color dries down
like all the way so you can touch your
mouth and nothing's gonna be on your
hand this one it's not super like messy
or anything like that but if you do hit
your finger to your mouth it's gonna be
like a little bit on your finger I've
had a lot of favorite palettes this
month palettes that I'm like really
impressed by and I feel like sometimes
it's kind of hard to be impressed by
palettes because there's so many that
come out which I'm not complaining I'm
saying you know I have quite a few that
I've really been loving first I'm gonna
start with the kat von d palette and
this is the metal matte palette I swatch
this and I was so blown away I will put
a little video clip of the swatches here
just was like wow these colors look
incredible the formulas so nice I love
everything about them and I love that
it's like shimmer and a matte shimmer
and a matte shimmer in a matte and
they're kind of corresponding shades
this is such a great brow bone highlight
I've been using this in every look
basically since I got it
this thunderstruck I shot it was such a
beautiful inner corner highlight that
I've been loving as far as the mattes
oak bone velvet and this this color here
and this color are just been like go
twos for me recently so love love this
palette great formula another palette
that I'm impressed by is this Bobby
Brown caviar and Ruby's eyeshadow
palette this palette has the most
beautiful package a special edition
package
I feel like it's very royal very luxe
chic rich expensive and then when you
open it it's just ah it's so pretty I
mean these are just colors that are very
different for me like usually I go for a
very warm tone palette and this is the
most beautiful neutral tone palette ever
like not only that but the formulation
of the eyeshadows are so pigmented and
beautiful and easy to blend I just love
it this is like the most amazing dark
brown that doesn't have any red
undertone when I put it in my crease
whereas for me my eyelids tend to pull a
lot of reds because I have really red
eyelids
naturally so even when I put a Brown
that's not a warm tone somehow it still
looks warm but this Brown is not like
that at all it's so so pretty I warrant
for Christmas Eve and I loved it
this shade in the center here is I would
say more of like a glitter topper it's
not like when I rub it you can see it
kind of looks like broken up or
something like it's it's more just loose
glitter but packed into a shadow at
first swatch you don't really vibe with
it I guess you would say but if you use
it in a different way which I did I
actually dipped my pencil brush with
some little fix+
and I put it in my inner corner on top
of the inner corner highlight and it
looked so good and I did that on
Christmas Eve and I also placed that on
top of a shimmer shadow just to add the
specks of glitter and it looks so good
at first when i swatched I was like this
is weird but then when I used it a
different way as like pops of glitter
everywhere it just looks stunning so
good but yeah pretty much this whole row
I've been using constantly since I got
it this one this one this one I haven't
really used these shades yet haven't got
around to them but overall the aesthetic
of this palette is very pleasing it's
not super warm tone if you're looking
for something that's not a warm tone
palette and is like a little bit more
topi and neutral this is just so good
and I feel like it's a perfect travel
size because you can do a bunch of
different looks with it next palette is
the kathleenlights dream Street shadow
palette this is in collab the collab
collaboration with color pop god damn
this palette is so pretty like I just
I'm so blown away by this palette it's
what
I have on my eyes 100% this is the
palette on my eyes right now I'm
impressed with the glitter flecks the
the finishes the pigmentation just
everything about it I've torn into this
color right here like hard cuz it's my
favorite color in the palette what's on
my lids right now I just think this
whole palette overall is really
aesthetically pleasing too
I feel like if you like warm tones
you're gonna love this palette this
color is like a must-have for me when I
do a lot of different looks and I'm
happy it's in the palette I don't care
how many times somebody puts that type
of color and a palette I don't care I
think it's really really good to have in
a palette no matter how many times you
own say for example like Peach Smoothie
or orange soda or anything like that
like I still think having that in every
palette with warm tones is just so
helpful because when I apply color like
this in my crease before I use like a
warm tone shade it just makes everything
look that much more ingredient I love
everything about this palette good job
Kathleen I'm gonna eat another one of
these though for real
lastly for the palette we have the
Charlotte Tilbury instant eye palette
first of all this packaging I mean
Charlotte this package is so over the
top beautiful I love love love love this
you're looking for like a gift for
anybody or something that you feel
someone will get a lot of use out of
this palette is so nice it's like the
most travel friendly user-friendly
palette that you could get somebody
especially if they're intimidated by
makeup or something because first of all
it has little sections of three so you
can pair these three colors these three
colors these three colors so it really
does like color combinations for you and
the first one says day eye
this one says desk eyes so like you know
if you want to look saucy at the office
you know Sam
this one says date eye and then this one
says disco eye it's just so easy to
follow the palette I've been using desk
eye a lot along with day eye for my more
everyday makeup looks that I've been
doing recently this is so good to travel
with because it's like you have your
blacks your Browns your transitions
shades your brow bone highlights it's
just anything you would need in one
palette super easy to use really good
for me
it's amazing incredible alright now
we're gonna move on to some lashes that
I've been loving I'm actually wearing
them right now
these Lily lashes in collaboration with
makeup by Samuel he is a talented ass
makeup artist who does such great work
he does a lot of celebrities he just
killed it with this lash let me show you
guys do you guys see how beautiful this
lashes it's so fluttery I love that it's
short in the inner corner and then
flares out it is a little thicker and
longer in the outer corner cuz that's
what's gonna give you that cat eye look
it's gonna give your eye that lifted
look I feel like when I wear these
eyelashes it just looks so pretty
fluttery and they're bandless lashes so
that means they don't have a thick thick
band which is great for more natural
makeup looks they aren't too heavy I
feel like he created these for that
celebrity makeup type of look where it's
like it's still really glamorous for the
red carpet but it's not like oh my god
you're wearing like super fake eyelash I
mean I feel like that's the vibe and I
love them I think they're perfect
eyelashes alright this is a brow product
that I've been obsessed with for quite
some time now I know they actually gave
this to me a while back when I went to
go visit them before it was even out yet
this is the foolproof brow powder by
Benefit Cosmetics and I use the shade
number three because I don't like it to
be extra dark and I feel like three is
the perfect color because it has that
nice ashy and kind of a warm tone it's
like a dual and I like to apply this
with my benefit little angled brush the
theory behind this is that it's already
laid out to where the front of your brow
you want to look lighter so here's the
lighter shade and then the outside of
the brow where we need a little bit more
touch-up and filling in is darker so you
have that nice gradient look and that's
I feel like that's a really smart
concept I use this along with the
precisely my brow pencil so what I like
to do is first like outline the shape
with the pencil and like lightly fill it
in but then I go in with this brow
powder and this angled brush and I like
to like feather through hair like
strokes with the powder and I
do it just like it says I'll use the
lighter shade in the front and then this
darker shade on the outer part and I
feel like it overall makes my brows look
more voluminous it doesn't leave it
doesn't leave space for any patchiness
or like sometimes what I just use the
pencil it looks great but then
throughout the day like part of it will
I don't know look a little less dark
than another part but I feel like
setting everything and really defining
it on top with powder especially this
one makes everything just look fuller
fluffier and a little bit softer even
though it defines it more it doesn't
look like waxy sometimes the pencil can
look waxy or shiny and flash photography
but the powder really like just
mattifies it all makes it look perfect
soft like I have it in my brows right
now and I just really like it it looks
clone hmm oh my God we're making moves
here is that it so the very last thing I
have for wear my favorites is a clothing
hey why can't I say ah whatever I'm just
gonna show you guys what I have okay I
have been loving teddy bear jackets
everything about teddy bear jackets
since it's been cold I've been wearing
these teddy bear jackets from I am Gia
which by the way I love that brand they
just have so many unique cool different
quirky pieces I love these jackets it
feels like I'm just wearing a comforter
out in public and I love that it's so
cozy they're so warm I wore these in
Texas when it was freezing and it kept
me super warm they just look so chic I
have it in this color I also have it in
black as well because black is a staple
you know you gotta have black see so it
looks like oversized but it's not super
like a long coat you know you're just
very chic you're like oh yes put some
like sunglasses on you look like you got
money you know and then lastly I have
this one which is a little bit different
let me see the sizing on these the black
one is extra small and then the brown
one is small I don't know why I have
them in so many different sizes and then
this jacket is actually a medium
a medium and it's a pullover like same
concept teddy bear jacket it's also from
IMG let me put it on for you guys no
there is this one it has little pockets
per seat in there I love that it has a
hood and then I love the black detailing
this is so cute really cozy if you guys
are looking for a good jack I would
definitely get one of these
cuz it's awesome and they have a lot of
cute stuff on their website I'm telling
you the owner of the brand just had a
dream to have this clothing line and
like she did it and that blew up really
quick like she's very successful I mean
I see this brand on so many celebrities
and it's not super black sound like
super high-end or anything it's like a
nice good price range for what it is all
the quality is so good so yeah you guys
definitely check out those coats I get a
lot of questions on it so I thought I
would put it in my favorites because I'd
be wearing those like every day alright
