for today's video we are going to be
talking about my go-to must-haves
absolutely cannot live without brushes
this includes face brushes I brushes
basically if I'm traveling and I need to
take all my brushes these are my go-to
so I'm going to go through each one and
tell you why I love them you guys are
interested let's get started starting
off with the face the B blender this you
gotta have it I've tried other dupes for
the Beauty Blender sponge all the other
ones just don't feel as fluffy and as
soft as the Beauty Blender one does this
one is my absolute favorite I love the
nude one and the black one not so much
the pink for some reason the pink one
when I wash it pink dye comes out I
don't know I don't really like that
personally I find that this one and the
black one are super soft super fluffy
and I just absolutely love them it gives
you such a flawless finish it doesn't
leave any streaks on your face certain
foundation I find you need a Beauty
Blender to apply them and when you try
to apply them with a buffer brush they
don't look as good so this one always
comes through for me for every
foundation so Beauty Blender must have
can't live with next we have the morphe
g36 brush I just like that it's a nice
size it covers really quickly when
you're in a rush I also love to use this
to buff foundation down the nest because
it is so soft I always use this with my
cream foundations I find that cream
foundations blend in a lot nicer with a
buffing brush that's just my opinion
I've noticed especially with the
hourglass foundation that I didn't
really particularly like this one with
the Beauty Blender but when I used a
buffing brush it was magic g36 is really
good for larger areas and for smaller
areas I love the morphe g40 this one is
same qualities as the other brush only
it's teeny weeny it gives you a nice
full coverage when you're buffing in
thursday's where I don't want my
foundation and I just want a spot
conceal so I will buff in with this
brush it looks really really nice it
gives you a beautiful finish and of
course like I said it is morphe so it is
pretty affordable love this brush so the
next brush is the morphe e 27 this is a
really really nice concealer brush I
love to apply concealer with Beauty
blenders but when I don't it's
definitely this one I find that this
gives a really nice natural finish under
the
it really blends out the product nicely
it doesn't leave too much excess
concealer in the fine lines increases it
kind of just nicely buffs them all out
so that I increased less throughout the
day and it works really well with
thicker concealers as well like for
example the Tarte creaseless concealer
or the bye-bye under-eye concealer it
just busted out perfectly this is where
this japonesque this is a japanesse
coumadin powder brush there was a huge
mystery as to whether it was definite or
nards because they do make similar style
brushes but this is Jeff and s this
burst is great for bronzing because it
is a larger brush it's really soft it
does come to a slight taper at the tip
so you could definitely use it to
lightly contour I wouldn't like heavily
contour with this but I use this with my
bronzer every day and it prevents
bronzer helmet because it is so large
it's so fluffy but still with the point
gets perfectly into the cheekbone covers
everything it's just so nice a quality
of these brushes is incredible
absolutely don't leave me ever
don't just continue me so next we have
these two brushes and I brought both of
them out because I really wanted to show
you the difference between this one
which is NARS and this one which is
japanesse you can see the handles are a
little bit thinner on the NARS ones and
this one is a little bit more of a taper
and this one is a little bit fluffier
like I said if you're on a budget you
want something very similar
honestly the jaw I can't even tell the
difference other than really the shapes
they are both incredible I love them so
much so I want to give you guys kind of
like two different options and these are
just like the smaller versions of the
large brush I showed you so typically I
use the NARS one in this case because
this is what I use to do a more sharp
contours I want you to see my cheekbones
this is the one that I use for that for
precision contouring it just has a
really perfect taper at the tip here
perfect size for that area it's just
beautiful fluffy comfortable and heat
rich lenses I'm really bad at describing
things so sorry
apologies we just move on to a blush
brush and this is a Mac 129 what'd I say
I cannot live without this blush brush
no I could definitely use another blush
brush this is just an example of a good
one that I like because it is not too
small not too dense it's not
and saw sometimes if you use a brush
that's too small for blush which i find
a lot of companies market blush brushes
as tiny brushes which I don't really
understand because I want something
that's a little bit larger that's going
to fit on the cheekbone and then blend
perfectly into my bronzer this one is a
great size it's not too small it's
really soft it doesn't give me a harsh
blush mark so I really really like it
you can definitely get a brush like this
in other brands not like oh my god you
have to go out and buy this one but this
is a good example of what a good blush
brush looks like for me this is what I
look for in that type of brush Mac one
Queen at 129 alright so next we have the
math 137 brush and this one has a really
specific use for me this is the brush
that I use when I want that all-over
shimmery bronze look when I want to use
the balm cosmetics mary lou manizer I
don't use it to contour anything I kind
of just like to lightly sweep it over
everywhere I put my bronzer on summer
days or when I want to look extra glowy
but you don't want too much of that
shimmer all over your face because it
can be a little bit overwhelming this
brush is perfect to disperse that
product evenly softly not too crazy
you're not going to have like a streak
of shimmer bronzer it's really really
soft and since the bristles are so long
it doesn't just like pack on product
it's going to give you a really light
color payoff very specific use for this
brush but I absolutely love it and if
you're into that all over like shimmery
bronze look for summer or spring then
this is a really nice person next we
have our highlighting brushes and fan
brushes are kind of where it's at for me
right now only because it makes it so
easy to just make a little line of
highlight it keeps it all linear makes
your cheekbones look really sharp it's
just a perfect brush to apply highlight
if I don't use fan brushes I'll use like
larger blending brushes like this if you
don't have fan brushes at home this is
something I learned from Patrick Todd
he's a celebrity makeup artist and he
uses smaller brushes like this because
he feels like he has more control I like
to use fan brushes and I'll switch it up
between that I wanted to give you
examples of two fan brushes that I reach
for all the time this one is by morphe
and it's the m3 10 and it's only $5 it
does look like it's been through some
sugar
okay I'm not gonna lie once there's some
bristles you know but five dollars is a
really good deal super affordable and
then there's japanesse which is
phenomenal amazing I love it and the
bristles are all you know somewhat
intact this one is twenty dollars you
can see the price difference there's
definitely a difference in the way they
look the morphe one has just kind of
been through something you know looks a
little like it didn't get a fresh blow
out type of vibe and this one it's still
pretty compact and linear I like them
both so whichever one I'm giving you two
options okay alright so next we have
this little baby japonesque brush 915 to
be exact I've had it for so many years
it's been with me for a very long time
it's still here I'm still holding onto
it as one of my favorite brushes what I
like about this one is compact size
which is nice because it's a great brush
to put in your purse and I'll tell you
why I use this brush to bust out my
under eyes or apply a little bit of
powder to my under eyes and what's great
is it just just perfectly in that socket
and it's soft enough to buff out
increasing throughout the night I don't
always apply more product I'll just kind
of like turn into the corner of the
party and like dip into my bag and just
just real quick blend out and increasing
that's happening and and that's it put
it back in my bags this is the perfect
brush for that because it's soft it
buffs those creases out and it's compact
you can fit it in any of your bags show
you can fit this in your wallet so small
but like keep it covered you know all
right so even were all the face brushes
moving on next we have the zoeva 142
this is a concealer buffer brush however
I don't use it for buffing concealer I
use this for eyeshadow base I'll tell
you why because this buffs out like
especially Mac soft ochre Paint Pots or
any of the Paint Pots it buffs out the
most thin beautiful even layer of
eyeshadow base over your eye space
sometimes if I use any other brushes or
if I use my fingers I feel like I could
leave like some patchiness here and
there but this will just buff everything
away and if you have patchiness on your
eyeshadow base that's where you're going
to run your eyeshadow over that it's
going to look patchy and it's just gonna
be a mess you're not people blend it out
I have found that these types of brushes
buff out the best on the eyeshadow
different brands carry this type of
brush this is just a style of it so you
know if you're into it you can kind of
pick one up from any brand
there's they're perfect for eyeshadow
base must-haves next I'm going to talk
about the Sigma concealer f70 brush I
also don't need super concealer I use
this for carving out my brows or
applying for example color pop
eyeshadows anything that's a cream base
that I want to apply to the lid I use
this brush I find that flat concealer
brushes just work really well to get
shimmering eyeshadows on the lid for any
like detail concealing as in like
sometimes I'll put concealer under my
wing to like clean it up sharpen it up
so this is kind of the brush that I use
for that just a tip if you have tried
color pop shimmery eyeshadows and they
don't go on as well either use your
finger or use a flat concealer brush
because these are synthetic hairs and it
just picks up the product a lot better
alright as we have a flat shader brush
this is one of my favorite brushes and I
feel like I would be lying if I didn't
put it in my video however the downside
is is that it has no name on it I've had
it for so long don't know where it came
from like super spin and it's just super
soft
it's the perfect brush to apply
eyeshadow on my lid on my brow bone if
anybody knows where this is from let me
know since I don't have a name I will
give you an alternative this one is from
zoeva and it's the 2 3 4 flat shader
brush this one also is a little bit
thicker so if I turn them on their size
you can see that the way the one has a
little bit more bristles more dense
suela is a little bit hard for you to
get Mac 239 also makes a really nice
flat shader brush I would use all three
of these this one just happens to be my
favorite I think it's just it's worn in
it's just my brush it's me I love it not
much more to say about a flat shader
brush they work great with powders this
is more for matte eyeshadows on the brow
bone or even satin eyeshadows alright
now we're gonna talk about the fun
brushes I love blending brushes for the
eyes they're probably my favorite
brushes to collect and even when I first
started doing makeup any time I bought a
blending brush it was so beautiful to me
I love the way they look I used to love
the mac 217 buying a new one of those
for me was magical
also I just felt some type of way when I
bought one I just thought it was like so
nice so expensive and they hold a
special place in my heart I even prefer
to clean blending brushes like out of
all the brushes I love to clean them I
think it's because I love them
let's be more specific like Smith's
Cosmetics blending brushes are the
absolute hands-down best I've ever tried
in my life like I could literally just
only use their blending brushes for the
rest of my life and be happy I used to
think nothing could replace a Mac 217
that's just kind of like the standard
blending brush which is also incredible
I love it but I'm just I love the Smith
brushes so much more now and these are
just staples for me favorite blending
brushes from them are the two three five
which is this one right here also has a
lot of control it has a really nice
taper to a fine tip I like to use this
for my transition colors any larger
areas in the crease this will work
perfectly this is the 230 which is a lot
smaller than the 235 it's more of the
long fluffy pencil brush my best way of
describing it is one of my favorites for
just smaller blending areas I guess and
then lastly we have the 2 for 7 and this
one is very similar comparable to I
would say the Mac 217 but it's like a
universal crease brush used for anything
because it doesn't have like that really
fine point taper when it has a taper
like these like for example the 2 3 5
has a nice fine point it's going to give
you like a targeted area to cover so
like if I want to do a cut crease this
is so good for that just because it is
smaller compact I just love it
especially if you have like smaller
creases or eyelids they just have a
blending brush for every eye shape I
feel hopefully I explained that ok I
hope and then lastly for the blending
brushes I have the 2 to 8 crease brush
by zoeva this one is not absolutely
necessary but it's nice to have it's one
of the nice to have brushes for me
because it works really well to blend
out the edges of your eyeshadow I don't
necessarily use this for cut crease to
define the crease if you have a larger
list base in a larger crease space and
this would probably work really well for
you as a transition shade brush it's a
really nice good quality brush that I
keep but yeah that's what I use it for
all right we're almost finished here
just have a few more next we have the
Smith 2 5 7 brush this brush has a very
interesting shape by this I don't think
seeing another brand have a brush like
this it's almost like a flat brush but
then it comes to a point it's very very
different I like to use this brush to
buff out the under-eye because it does
have that fine point so this point will
really target the product right under
the lash line and then the soft
fluffiness of the base will blend it out
as you're applying the product and I
just really love this brush for that I
also love this for I know this is weird
too a lot of people but contouring the
Cupid's bow we were saying but if you
want your Cupid's bow to look deeper and
more defined you can take a really light
amount of contour powder and just put it
right here and it's like something about
it fits perfectly in that little area
and it doesn't put the product on too
aggressively so that's really what I use
it for but also the under eyes really
nice brush for that they also make a
tinier version of that I just kind of
wanted to show you the difference
between the two this one is also really
good for the under-eye
I like the larger one better but I
wanted to show you the two different
sizes just here on camera because I do
have them both in my light go to
barcia's but I know I don't use this one
as much as I use the larger one then
next I have two brushes that I
absolutely love these are my go-to
brushes when I smoke out my lower
lashline must have can't live without
absolutely positively need these brushes
in my life this one is the one by dose
of colors it's their pencil brush and
this is the morphe e36 very similar
brushes i would say on the dose of
colors one is a little bit more narrow
gives you a little bit more of a
controlled application and the morphe
one is a little bit fluffier so it's
going to give you a more diffused
application it's nice to have both of
them in my go-to brushes because
depending on which one I pick up for my
under eye I use the other one for like
an inner corner highlight so it has more
shimmer on it the next one how about
liner brushes liner brushes are very
important to me they cannot be replaced
they have to be these brushes as of now
in the future who knows maybe I'll find
something else but this one is from the
craft store this is from Michaels I
picked it up in October when I was
buying brushes for makeup tutorials and
one day I just decided to use it for
eyeliner and it was magical like we
became one okay this brush is everything
to me it's just a really small little
thin brush this is said it's number two
level two I'll put it in the description
box for you guys but
it makes the perfect little slick it's
narrow enough to get that really thin
part of the wing it's easy to apply
liner with this I do always use gel
liner so credible incredible incredible
incredible will please credible amazing
show-stopping spectacular never the same
totally unique completely not ever been
done before unafraid to reference core
not reference put it in a blender
on it vomit on it eat it give birth to
it okay I said I myself Katie sent me
that video it just works perfectly for
this moment so there you go another
liner oh my god Honda's kept going so
this is another layer brush and it's
very new to me Katie also brought me
onto this brush this is the Sonia Kashuk
number 27 brush this is a really really
really really good eyeliner brush some
people do liner better with this and
some people work better with angled
brushes angled brushes I would say are a
lot easier for beginners or anyone who
is new to a wing because the hardest
part is kind of getting a straight line
an angled brushes re give you that
guideline if you struggle with eyeliner
I would say that this one would be
better this one is really good for like
detail you're comfortable doing one
liner but this one you're going to get
an awesome wing every time and it's
super stiff I hate angled brushes that
are too flimsy there the bristles kind
of like layer out too much then your
eyeliner is messy but this one is sturdy
and it gives the perfect wing the very
last two brushes I have to talk about
our angled brushes the Mac 266 this is a
really great universal angled brush it's
synthetic hairs which I like for angled
brushes like I said natural hairs on
angled brushes they get too messy for me
and synthetic ones stays really nice and
together compact they don't spring out
on you as much so I like the 266 there's
also a 263 that looks exactly like this
but it's natural here this one just
works great with eyeliner or browse for
detail work under the lash line it's
kind of just a universal angled brush
works for everything love it and then
lastly we have the 7b a BH brush this is
a really really good eyebrow brush for
the same reason
synthetic hairs it's stiff sturdy gives
you really nice control over making
those hair like strokes you don't want
to use a natural haired angled brush to
your eyebrows I feel like it doesn't
give you that sharp crisp line that you
need to make those hair like strokes
this one is really good it's nice
because it has a spoolie on the other
end so you know you could just brush
through it you don't need to have
multiple brushes in your hand and that's
if you're using like powder or pomade
this is really really nice all right
guys it's Alisa that's everything those
are all my brushes that I live I hope
you guys enjoyed this video found it
