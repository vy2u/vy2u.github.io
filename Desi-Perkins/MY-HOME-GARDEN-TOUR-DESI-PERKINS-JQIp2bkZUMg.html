today's video is gonna be a tour of my
garden disclaimer I know nothing about
gardening every step of the way I'm
learning when things die I'm like oh
wait I did that wrong ever since I was
little oh my god what is that the
squirrel oh I'm under attack here in the
backyard by the way just in case you
guys haven't been watching my Hydra
stories ever since I was little I
remember we moved into this home and it
didn't have like the biggest backyard it
just had a little bit of grass and I was
in second grade and I decided I wanted
to plant seeds and start a little garden
so I planted all these strawberries and
all this stuff and the minute it started
showing like some growth my mom told me
we had to move and it was the saddest
day of my life and ever since then I
wanted to have a garden my mom has known
this everyone has known this I've always
wanted to have a garden now that we have
our very own a home which I'm so excited
and grateful for I have a garden and
it's honestly like the thing that makes
me so happy in this world just seeing
all the growth makes me so excited and I
show you guys daily updates on IG
stories and on snapchat and you guys
really like it and you asked me to do a
garden tour today that's what I'm gonna
be doing I know you guys want a house
tour as well I know I promise you I will
have a house tour soon this is like a
baby segment leading into that we are
gonna go ahead and check out the garden
I'm gonna show you everything the reason
I decided to film this today is because
I actually bought some cilantro and I'm
gonna film us putting it in today we
also bought new flowers the other day
which I'm excited about so I'm just
gonna go ahead and show you guys what I
got going on okay follow me the path of
success I feel like DJ Khaled with all
these garden posts when we first moved
into this home I envisioned something
magical happening on this and I've
always wanted the climber plants that
wrap around the whole structure and then
once we do that I want to put like
twinkling lights here so that at night
if we have dinner out here it's going to
be magical it's like everything I ever
wanted
there comes Steven
oh yeah there comes Steven with all the
stuff yeah sure did look I just got
these like two days ago they're already
dying I think they need water and it's
like a lot of Sun on them right now but
mostly I think we need to water them and
a lot of you guys asked me about this
table set this is actually from Costco I
love this table I feel like it's so
pretty I hate the chairs but I got chair
coverings for some of them just to see
what it looked like and I think it looks
a lot nicer and brighter all right so
let's start the tour first thing we have
here is a lime tree now the fruit trees
that are in our yard we're here when we
bought the house I'm really happy about
that in this neighborhood there is a lot
of fruit trees my neighbors have lemon
trees orange trees I'm so happy that
they picked limes
because being Mexican like I'll take
limes over lemons any day I feel like I
just use limes for everything look this
is pretty big when I first started
showing you guys on Instagram these were
so tiny and now they're starting to
actually turn into lime so every day
when you garden is exciting because
overnight something can just blossom and
it's so amazing I look forward every day
to coming outside and seeing how big
things are getting how things are
growing the next tree we have here at
this is a peach tree and if you guys
follow me on Instagram and you will know
that I had maybe about five peaches that
were like this big on this tree but they
were stolen in the night okay either it
was a squirrel or a bird I don't know
what stole my peaches but it's really
sad because I was so excited watching
them grow and they're not gonna blossom
again until next year so that's it for
my peach tree it's just gonna be here
for the time being so right here we have
our apple tree this is probably the most
fruitful of all of our trees it has so
many apples all over everywhere I look
on every branch there's a bunch of
apples and it just makes me so happy to
see all of the fruit doing so well on
this tree look at those little apples
coming in right there look every branch
you look on there is more apples love
this tree it's so pretty
this has been so therapeutic for me you
know if you don't have a backyard if you
have like a balcony
and it gets good son you could just put
like a little thing for herbs out there
and just watching things grow and every
day checking up on it just like has
changed my like it relaxes me I feel
less stressed I feel so happy every day
watching all of this growth so I'm so
happy to be sharing it with you guys so
they told us this was the peach tree and
so I'm not sure if it's a different type
of peach or what what is it
does it look like nothing I don't know
it's a furry nub if anybody knows put it
in the comments down below okay cuz I'm
trying to figure out all right so
everything in here we planted moving in
when we first moved in they had like
wild tomato it was like a mess so we
took everything out Stevens mom she
loves to garden so she's been helping me
garden and she helped me plant all of
these things because obviously I don't
know what I'm doing this is my first
time so these two came with the house
they were already built here they have a
built-in sprinkler system so it releases
water all the way down into the bottom
of the soil which is nice let me give
you a tour we have some radishes oh my
god look it's a baby radish so tiny like
you can really see them here and they
come in different shapes sizes like
they're so good we've already had a few
so we have those along the sides of the
box this one looks like it's getting
pretty massive so I feel like this one's
kind of done so we could try to pull
this one out well they're kind of hard
to get out to they're rooted in there
boom look at that beautiful radish we
use these for avocado toast so then
right here we have our jalapeno plant my
pride and joy Steven loves the jalapeno
plant he's so excited I mean they're
looking really really good right now
look at that stephen and i YouTubed
how to prune your plan because we had no
idea and our stuff was looking extra
bushy so pruning is basically when you
trim the arm they like they call them
the armpits of the vines and the stems
so that it's not stealing nutrients from
the main stems and correct me if I'm
wrong
I'm not an expert this is like I just
learned this so they don't take
nutrients from the stems that are
actually bearing the most fruit because
if you let it grow wild then the whole
plant is pushing nutrients through the
other stems that aren't really going to
bear that much fruit or vegetable I hope
I explained that correctly we also put
in these sticks everyone was telling us
on instagram to put in these sticks even
also YouTubed tomato vines like to climb
up this is like a jute twine and he tied
the vines up very very loosely they can
still grow through but they grow upwards
these are our cherry tomatoes I love
cherry tomatoes I eat them like crazy
over here we have a stevia plant so
stevia is like a sugar it's a natural
sugar
it's nice when you're in the garden to
just pull it off and then eat it
that's it taste sweet it's crazy it
tastes like sugar tastes like sugar I
think it's being invaded by bugs right
now we haven't used pesticides or
anything in our garden because I wanted
to avoid it and just see what happens
but I think this one is needs a little
bit of help over here we have some time
this is actually already here so we kind
of just left it here it back but I use
this like every night when we cook steak
yeah Stephen uses it when it cooks with
steak smells the main thing smell it
smells good here we have onions we
actually just cut these back because
they grew out a little bit too far more
radishes along this area we're about to
plant some cilantro I think we're into
it right over here here's our tomato
plant so these are just normal sized
Tomatoes and this one is doing really
really well it actually had some type of
fungus for a minute there at home yeah
because it was all laying on the ground
so we've got over watered and then the
water
drying up so it did the fungus but now
once we hung it up and then we trimmed
it back now it has a little bit more
airflow it had little black dots all
over the leaves so the tomatoes were
fine but the leaves looked crazy and now
they're all healthy again for the most
part so we have nursed it back to health
it's doing pretty good so over here this
is our cucumber I recently just picked a
lot of the cucumbers because I felt like
they were ready I had the most massive
cucumber and it tasted incredible
there's one there's a little baby here's
the tag for the cucumbers oh that one
was looking pretty good so many
cucumbers already and this is crazy
because when we left out of town there
was nothing and then we came back we had
the most massive cucumber she find
another one oh wow we're probably gonna
vine this up as well yeah tomatoes just
so that we have a little bit more room
in this box this is our bell pepper
plant and look at this bell pepper it's
getting bigger and bigger every day
there's only two but and we have
zucchini squash but nothing's nothing's
really happening over here in our
zucchini squash this this side is a
little bit more of the struggle side
because they're supposed to be radishes
here too but nothing has really grown I
mean I see something coming up right
here but it this this side is so in the
Sun that I think it's just too much Sun
I know people have tents that they put
over it so they don't get as much Sun
this one being a little bit more in the
shade it thrives and it gets sun only a
certain part of the day which is nice
but this one is constant Sun down here
we have little sugar peas how cute are
they look at them these also need to be
vind I'm just waiting for the bunnies to
find them they'll probably eat them all
once they figure out they're here you
guys we've been invaded by bunnies okay
they are everywhere bunnies lizards oh
look at this cucumber it's hanging off
over here
they're so prickly I never realized how
spiky they are this is the soil we will
be using for our gardening today coming
in hot so what did you pick here honey
we have lime cilantro those we want to I
want to be able to make salsa we need it
for our everything we need it for
everything
Oh salsa cook it's a must and then I
found this
it's an oregano but it's spicy and it's
super spicy like I had one bite of it
and it was alive my pasta sauce maybe I
have the garden soil this is what we're
gonna use in the box that we're gonna
mix into the topsoil for the cilantro
and the oregano and I have this potting
mix and that's gonna use for the flowers
that desi just showed you when we pop
those plants looks so much nicer
we're probably is showing people how not
to cart now not to garden this is our
first garden guys so this is not a
how-to this is just what we're doing
okay just to make that very clear
disclaimer
the pups
they're so cute I've never actually
depotted one of these before
so you don't know what we're doing
basically no idea how to do keep that
because you're gonna put it out there so
I watched on YouTube supposed to break
it up a little bit to release the root
system okay and you put it in there mmm
that's the lunchroom looks weak looks
weak in there and we're gonna go right
next to this other one meanwhile stake
your claim does packing it in so it
stays up cool
cilantro it down no matter where do we
put the oregano
get you growing a little herb garden
did that is that it planted everything
we had to plan for today alright so that
is it I hope you guys enjoyed this
