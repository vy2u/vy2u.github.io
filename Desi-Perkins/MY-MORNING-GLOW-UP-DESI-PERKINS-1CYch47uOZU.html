you didn't drink the last coffee did you
No
for sure
okay
hear me black mirror Instagram I'm going
right now please
all right almost up here a little bit
Oh
I hope you guys enjoyed my little
glow-up skit I want to say a huge thank
you to Olay for partnering with me to
create this video I love doing skits
like this you always have to remember
that it's not all about makeup it's also
really important to take care of your
skin this is your body your face the
inside out that's what this whole skit
was really about just making sure you
stay on your fitness you didn't write I
just quickly wanted to chat about the
Olay products using this video this is
the cleansing infusion hydro globe body
wash my favorite scent of the two scents
is deep seek help smells so good it's
like that fresh sea scent but like clean
it smells like you're just hugging a
sexy man
and I also used the OL a cleansing
infusion hydra glow a facial cleanser in
the video this is specifically targeted
to give you a glow it helps improve your
skin's radiance therefore making it look
more naturally glowy there's a matching
body wash for your face wash and there's
two scents I shared with you my favorite
scent the other scent is crushed ginger
and citrus extract also comes with the
face wash and body wash there's been
times where like I make sure I'm all
glowy and then you know the rest of my
body looks all ashy and we don't want
that make sure you stay hydrated all
these products are available at
Walgreens if you guys are interested in
picking them up and trying them out
alright I gotta put some makeup on just
using a little foundation here you know
those mornings you just wake up and
you're like whoa that's me today I slept
with my hair wet I might give you myself
a tan right now did I get more pale
overnight is that what's happening here
something's happening
I think that's what's happening so I'm
just using a little Giorgio Armani
foundation 7.5 Wow and these winter
months we just lose our tan mmm
we're gonna get the skin right it's all
about skin do you guys ever look back at
pictures from high school and you just
see yourself in that awkward phase where
you're like what was I thinking and you
look at pictures of yourself now on
you're like dang you know I really had a
glow up I do all the time and then I
wonder to myself will I be looking back
at pictures of myself now in the future
and saying like what was I thinking
mother you never know I used to do all
of my makeup like a totally crazy smoky
eye and then I wouldn't add brows my
brows would just look like this with a
smoky eye okay somebody hand her a brow
pencil I think the one thing that I'm
happy that I did was take care of my
skin now I used so many facial products
so many moisturizers eye creams
everything you have to you have to a
little concealer if you look tired
concealer always fixes that at least
most of the time little brow just like
all these little sparse areas I like
teased a just a pencil and I want to do
something quick out the door I'm never
really out the door though it's like my
face comes to life with brows you just
need them they're very important I feel
like skin is just so important skin care
staying hydrated because that's what's
gonna keep your skin looking young plump
I used to also when I got out of the
shower I'll never forget I just take my
towel and I'd rub it on my eyes till I'm
dry my face and my mom saw me one day
and she's like don't do that you're
gonna get older faster I'm starting to
see the signs of not listening to her
next highlight Wego we're gonna add it
everywhere to the nose
do you guys have any glow up stories
things that you look back on and you
were like wow you know I do this so much
better now I feel like kids nowadays
don't even have awkward phases 16 year
olds be out here looking better than a
lot of people like they're down with the
trends they don't look 16 they like
totally get to skip that awkward phase
then of course inner corner highlight
that's gonna brighten up the eyes if
you're looking a little tired bronzer
and blush and we're pretty much done
with the face makeup right under the
highlight give yourself a contrast blush
is always good to make your skin look
alive fresh I'm using peaches here like
to put a little across the nose too I
also like to take a little blush
sometimes and just just put it through
the crease a little bit I always find
that lashes really pull the whole look
together when you want to give yourself
a little pick-me-up especially when your
eyes are tired because I feel like it
just open
them uh well flash is also low-key make
you feel like you put in a lot more
effort into your eye makeup even if you
didn't really wear eyeshadow see that
lift now I'd like to go for more of a
natural lip color and this is NYX London
this is pretty close to my natural lip
shade whoo that's it for the glow up
glam really quick really easy big
difference from when I first started out
this morning again thank you all a and
thank you guys so much for watching and
supporting this video see you guys in
the next video but chocolate scare take
to the fear of the chancla tip 3 take 4
figure of the chocolate take 1 5 5 5
okay you married to this what's on this
switch like I'm like a little baby oh I
used to know I used it already she's
using it she faked use it to show
