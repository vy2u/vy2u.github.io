today's video is going to be all about
foundation when I was thinking about
getting ready the other day a light bulb
went off in my head and I was like that
would be a cool video if I just talked
about not only my favorite foundations
but why I would wear this foundation do
I want to look natural don't look face
tune don't want to look full-coverage am
I going to be in the heat am I gonna be
eating tacos all of these things I take
into consideration when choosing a
foundation for that day so we're gonna
go into it I'm gonna start with the
lowest coverage to the fullest coverage
and just like work my way down before I
talk about the foundations I just wanted
to tell you guys my skin type I know a
lot of people judge foundations based on
their skin type what works for me may
not work for you accepted at excetera
so my skin type is combination I'm
pretty normal around this area and then
oily here I get very shiny in this area
here so the first thing is the CC cream
this for sure is that real quick let me
look like I'm naturally slang I've got
errands to do I got somewhere to be five
minutes but I still want to look
snatched and I may be in the Sun this is
the it cosmetics CC your skin but better
full coverage color correcting
anti-aging hydrating serum that is a
long long name and it has SPF 50 it's
amazing I will be the first person to
tell you that I'm not a fan of CC creams
baby cream baby CC creams dd creams I'm
pretty sure I saw on FF cream they're
evolving and I still just don't know
what the letters stand for I think CC
color correcting that makes sense I know
they've never worked for me but this one
this one has worked for me it's really
full coverage it covers all of my
breakouts but it still looks like skin
which is weird it just looks like you
applied a really hydrating moisturizer
that covers everything I use my hands to
apply it so it's really fast throw it on
real quick and you look naturally
beautiful that's what this is and I'm in
the shade tan the only thing I will say
about this is that I know a lot of CC
creams not just it cosmetics but like a
lot of companies who put out CC and BB
and you know whatever Chino that out
BB Creams they do not really cater to
medium to deep skin tones it's like
everything is really light and then it's
a little bit ashy that's the only
downside to CC creams and BB creams in
general as far as the finish of CC
creams and BB creams they're meant to
make you look like natural and have a
really nice glow to the skin so they're
not going to be matte this is definitely
more of a dewy finish I would say in
particular this one isn't the most dewy
which is nice because you don't want to
look greasy this one has a good
consistency just fresh fresh it's not
too oily not too greasy
all right nobody does we have the Urban
Decay Naked skin one in done foundation
this one also has an SPF it is SPF 20
this one I would put in the family of
like a great daytime foundation I
absolutely love this I think it's such a
good foundation for any skin type I've
seen so many people rave about it and
when I first tried it I also really
really loved it
this has like a satiny skin like finish
it's very light but it covers it's just
like the most beautiful lightweight
foundation I know Vegas neighs is it I
actually watched her snapshots and she
talked about how she loved this and she
lives in Vegas and it's really really
hot there so for a foundation to hold up
and that kind of heat is great I'm in
the shade medium dark and I would say
this one is a little bit more full
coverage than the it cosmetics CC cream
obviously this one's more of a
foundation if I'm going to like brunch
or whatever I'm going to be on the Sun I
love to use something like this when I
want my skin to look a little bit more
perfect so this is like the next level
first the CC cream was like a little bit
more of like Oh running errands I
wouldn't do a full glam with the CC
cream but then this one this one is
great not only for running errands
because it's gonna last you all day but
it's also good for a full blam because
it does give you a really nice finish so
the next two foundations I'm going to
put in the category of like my universal
foundations and I think we all have that
foundation that we could go to a sure
thing you know that it's going to work
for any occasion and I have two one is
like a high end and one is a drugstore
and I love them both equal so the high
end foundation is the
benefit hello flawless this one also has
an SPF of 20 which is nice
usually I wouldn't recommend an SPF for
nighttime use when you're gonna be
taking flash photography because if you
guys don't know SPF does give you
flashback flashback is when you wear SPF
and you take photos with flash
photography at night and you look at the
photo and you're like whoa why is my
face so white when you know that's not
what you look like it's because the SPF
and your foundation or your moisturizer
is actually flashing back at the camera
but for some reason I've never had a
problem with this one and then my
drugstore version of this go-to
foundation is the Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless I love these two
foundations these are my safe bet always
gonna work for me they're just gonna
come through for me they're gonna give
me the right amount of coverage they're
gonna make me look healthy healthy is a
word I like to use when I'm describing
the skin to look glowy and not super
matte when I say healthy I mean like
more of a satin / dewy even though this
is the Maybelline matte and poreless
it's not like super super matte it looks
really really nice and it does give you
kind of a matte finish but I wouldn't
say it's like you know the Loreal Pro
matte which is like really really mad
the colors I have for these foundations
the benefit hello flawless I'm in the
shade beige and the matte and poreless
by Maybelline I'm in the shade 222 these
two definitely have a very healthy glow
finish
they're not super matte they're not
super dewy they kind of live in the
middle so this would be great for all
skin types in my opinion then the hello
flawless this one I would say wears a
little bit more dewy throughout the day
so it's great satin finish when you
first apply it it stays really well but
I know that it does get a little bit
more I like to say dewy but I would say
it does get a little bit doing so I'm
not sure how great this would work on
oily skin let me know if you guys have
tried it and you have oily skin but I
definitely think it's gonna be great
for dry combination and normal
skin types a shell if I talk about any
of these foundations and you guys have a
certain skin type and maybe one did work
for you one didn't work for you I would
love you guys to leave those in the
comments I just want to say that real
quick so that you guys can all help each
other because clearly I only have the
skin type I have so I just have to go by
what I see and what I hear people say
and how it wears on me to kind of think
about how would wear on other skin types
so let's all help each other out in this
community a god all my foundations are
so dirty my mom literally gets mad at me
when she sees my videos and she's like
why don't you wipe off your compacts why
don't you wipe off your makeup why does
it look so dirty I'm like so like I
think about her yelling at me in Spanish
when she's really mad so I got to just
make sure to give it a good wipe in then
we have the NARS all day luminous
weightless foundation I'm in the shade
Syracuse which is medium dark one this
is another foundation that you can wear
it during the day or you could wear it
to events who wear it Joey
tacos I wouldn't really wear it to the
beach I wouldn't really wear it to like
the gym but I would wear it on other
daytime events nighttime events so if I
think to myself hmmm I want to look
healthy and luminous hmmm this one this
foundation got so many mixed reviews
when it first came out it got bad
reviews and it got good reviews I never
really was interested in trying it
because I did see such bad reviews and I
was like I'm not going to buy that when
I was at the Sephora in France I wanted
to buy the sheer globe by NARS the girl
helping me accidentally gave me this one
and I didn't realize until I got back to
my hotel and I was like oh well I'm just
gonna use it anyway so I've tried it out
and I I didn't really feel like a strong
connection to it I used it with my
Beauty Blender I thought whatever about
it I wasn't like oh my god I kind of put
it down for a while I've been mixing
this with other foundations I like to
mix foundations all the time but I've
never like gone back to using it on its
own until for some reason I started I
applied this one day with my hands and I
was like first of all why would I apply
foundation with my hands cuz I never do
that but I did and it was a totally
different experience I used it all over
my face that I noticed as I was blending
it in I was like wow this looks amazing
like it's giving me that wow factor that
it didn't give me when I applied it with
the Beauty Blender afterwards
just made sure that there was no streaks
by going over it with my beauty blender
but the initial application was with my
hands and it looked amazing it's
supposed to give you that nice
luminosity I'm actually wearing the
foundation right now this is the current
foundation that I have on if I were to
compare this to the NARS sheer glow that
is a lot more slippery its luminous but
it moves around a little bit more
whereas this one it sets and it still
gives you a healthy look I put this
foundation to the test recently when I
went to Vegas I wore this foundation and
it was everything and what's weird is
that usually actually every single time
I wear foundation my nose gets oily
right here every single time it just
gets shiny I always have to powder it I
look in the mirror and I'm like whoa I
have to dab it I looked in the mirror
after a long day and my nose was not
shiny and that's never happened I'm
usually always shiny there and I
literally had to look again and think
what's happening like we're in Vegas
it's hot how is my nose not shiny it was
because I was wearing this foundation if
you have it and you didn't like it
try it again let me know what you think
after you try it like this let me know
alright I'm going to show you guys a
curveball the next thing I'm going to be
talking about is a powder foundation
I've always used powder foundations but
I don't use them traditionally I like to
use them with regular foundations I have
been loving the bare minerals Barre pro
foundation this is what I use when not
only am i breaking out and I want to
look like I'm not breaking out but I'll
also use it to bronze my skin contour my
nose and just give me that face tuned
flawless finish
so whatever foundation I'm wearing
underneath I will depending on what my
skin looks like I will set it with the
powder foundation like a light dust and
it's going to give you a little bit more
coverage and say for example you're
breaking out in this area here and you
want more coverage but you want a bronze
and you don't want to just keep adding
adding adding more makeup I will just a
powder foundation to bronze the
perimeter of my face and that's going to
give you double the coverage and it's
just going to look amazing the shade
that I'm in is camel this is my all-over
skin tone shade I do have a darker one
that I like to use to contour and bronze
my skin and also to contour my nose if
you like to wear powder foundation on
its own it's going to be great if you
put on top a foundation you're just
going to look like a doll you're going
to look perfect so that is why I like
the powder foundation
so my last category is my full coverage
must-haves I have four here for full
coverage foundations two of them are
drugstore and two of them are high-end
these are the ones I wear when I don't
want any sweat I don't want any oil I
don't want any shine I want my skin to
look perfect all night I got places to
be for a long period of time so don't
play me foundations
two of them are drugstore and two of
them are high-end so I'm just gonna go
in with my drugstore first because I
know you guys like them drugstore
foundations as do i l'oreal infallible
Pro matte first of all this one before I
go into the next one this one's number
one this is the best drugstore not full
coverage foundation out there I'm in the
shade 107 fresh beige this is heavy duty
full coverage very very matte I'm not
sure how people with dry skin will feel
about this foundation but I know normal
combination and oily skin I've seen all
three of those skin types wear this
foundation and app and and love it you
do have dry skin and you've tried it let
me know what you think in the comments
down below if you're going for a
luminous look this is probably not the
foundation for you however what I like
to do and this is a trick I like to
apply my luminous foundation all over
whatever that foundation is and then
when I know that I'm gonna get oil on my
nose I apply this on the nose area on
the t-zone and it just like barricades
all the oils in it doesn't allow them to
come out but then the rest of my skin
still looks luminous so that's a trick
that I've been doing it just works it's
great so this to me is like a must-have
the next full coverage drugstore
foundation is the Milani concealing
perfects the two and one foundation and
concealer I'm in the shade medium beige
and usually when it's like a foundation
concealer two and one I'm like now but
this one actually covers the under eye
areas if you have any issues however I
still use a concealer with it because I
like that extra brightening this
foundation is great it is full coverage
it literally covers everything it
doesn't have a super matte finish this
one has more of a satin finish
it's an oil-free formula long wearing it
is lightweight and it's water resistant
and sweat proof and I think it's going
to be good for any skin type because it
doesn't fall too far on either so
to the spectrum it's just right in the
middle has a great coverage and I like
to apply this with a beauty blender so
my last two foundations are high-end
full coverage foundations and they have
been a part of my collection for a very
long time they're kind of like staples
for me and I'll show you guys what they
are
the first one is Mac Studio fluid I'm in
the shade NC 40 been with me for so long
it's probably the first high-end
foundation I've ever bought and this is
like what everybody and their moms used
to use back in the day and I still stand
by it and say that like I really really
love this foundation this isn't a
foundation that I would wear every day I
used to when I was younger but I'm
pretty sure I shouldn't have done that
because it is super super full coverage
it's not a light weight like you
definitely feel like I got makeup on
type of thing but if you really just
want to look great and you have a
special event this is always a go-to for
me it's just not too matte it's not too
dewy it's kind of in the middle it has
full coverage the only thing is that
Mac's foundations to me have like kind
of a funky smell I don't know what it is
about them but it goes away you just
smell it initially for me and then it
goes away you can apply this with a
kabuki brush or a Beauty Blender it
works well with any like form of
application to me this is great for
brides it just gives you that full
coverage pretty sure I wore Mac Studio
fluid on my wedding day as well and it
held up really really great there's not
much I can say about it it's a staple
for me full coverage great great and
then lastly we have the Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation I have a
love-hate relationship with this
foundation this foundation I promise you
looks spectacular like on your face it's
going to cover everything
you're going to look super matte super
perfect there's not going to be any oil
sliding through this foundation at least
for me when I wear it that's how I feel
however there's one huge downside to
this foundation this foundation gives
you the worst flashback it'll make your
whole face look white you cannot do
flash photography with this foundation
ever iPhone flash forget about it like
you will look like a ghost that is the
downfall of this if that was taken out
of the equation for this foundation it
would honestly be the great
foundation because if you want full
coverage this is it if you want your
face to look like a perfect perfect
porcelain doll this is it
it's just so good but the flash
photography kills it I still have it in
my favorites because it is a great
foundation if you're going to be working
all day long hours and you want your
face and your makeup to like hold up
this is the one you want to use and I
just think this foundation works great
with every skin type it's just like a
barrier of amazingness on your face
estee lauder whatever it is in this
foundation that gives you flashback you
guys change it I will literally just
because it will be the best foundation
it's just so good for that matte doll
like finish so those are my top favorite
foundations I hope you guys enjoyed this
