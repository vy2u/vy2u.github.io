beauties it's time for this Maryland
transformation to begin we're gonna
start off by applying a base to our lids
to prevent our eyeshadow from creasing
this is also gonna allow our shadows to
appear more vibrant take a white shadow
and apply this to the high points of
your brow this is going to lift the brow
bone we're also gonna place this on our
lid taking Mac's soft Brown and a fluffy
brush I'm gonna apply this to the crease
as my transition shade adding a
transition color first will allow you to
blend a darker color more seamlessly
Marilyn always had a very defined crease
so take a darker shadow and apply this
to the deepest part of your socket line
continue to blend this shade until it
has a smooth transition into the lighter
brown that we had placed down before
Marilyn always seemed to have a shimmer
on her brow bone so I'm taking nylon by
Mac and just popping that right under
the brow although Marilyn always opted
for Brown to line her eyes we're gonna
use a black gel liner roughly draw out
the shape that you would like and then
fill in the gaps I'm also going to
elongate the wing just a bit
now it's time to apply some false lashes
I took a pair of flutter lashes and cut
them in half so that I could apply them
just to the outer portions of my eye
this is going to elongate the eye as
well as get that sleepy effect that
Marilyn always went for use the dark
brown shade to create the illusion of a
heavy shadow under your lash pick up
your favorite mascara and apply this to
your falsies as well as to your natural
lashes to make them blend together more
seamlessly now mixing these two contour
colors I'm gonna apply these to the
cheekbones and to the nose to create a
subtle contour picking up Mac Melba
blush I'm gonna apply this to the apples
of my cheeks dragging it upwards I'm
taking Mac lip pencil and cherry and
lining my lips with this follow that up
with your favorite red lipstick I'm
using Mac's movie woo and applying that
to the lips last but not least add the
finishing touch which is Marilyn
Monroe's famous mole I hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
