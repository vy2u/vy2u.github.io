so today's video is gonna be on this
makeup look right here I know I looked a
little bit different today and that's
because I'm wearing a wig I decided to
change it up a little bit I was at home
playing with makeup yesterday and I just
decided to wear this wig for pictures
and you guys all really liked it so you
requested that I film a tutorial with
the wig so that's what I'm doing for you
guys today the makeup look is really
really nice I love this makeup look so
much like I just I did a rose gold to
yellow gold hombre liner with a black
winged liner and then just a matte brown
smokey eye with this like chocolatey
Brown lip so I really hope that you guys
enjoy this tutorial let's go ahead and
get started first thing I'm going to be
doing is priming my skin always prime my
skin except that one time that I forgot
this is the honest beauty everything
primer so I'm going to start off with
this luminous base cuz I want to be
human is so next I'm gonna go in with my
foundation this is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation stick I'm using the
shade 153 I also have the shade 127 to
highlight so I've used these a couple of
times so far I've really liked the
consistency it's super creamy pretty
full coverage so I'm just gonna go in
this wig is really just getting in my
way it's like what I have a stick I
don't know where to put the foundation I
look I don't even know if I have like
rhyme or reason to where I'm putting it
I take the 1:27 color which is a little
bit lighter and just apply this like
where you would normally highlight
sorry interesting the way I chose to
apply going on with my beauty blunder we
had a little technical difficulties with
the lighting so I had to readjust but
while I was gone I just put the benefit
high brow under my eyebrow next I'm
going in with of course Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot you guys can you do this
pretty much in every video the reason I
like this is because it cancels out all
this redness that I have on my lids so I
just apply it and I'm using a sigma
precision round pd-2 brush so I'm just
going to apply a nice amount to my lid
buff it up to the brow bone and it kind
of blends in nicely with that brow bone
highlight I've really been loving that
benefit high brow lately every time I
use a cream eyeshadow base I like to set
it with a powder you guys can use a
translucent powder I'll be using the Mac
Blanc type because I like to use this as
a brow bone highlight it's probably my
favorite eyeshadow for this so what I
like to do is pack it on to the highest
point of the eyebrow to where I focus
most of the product and then I start
dragging it down into the crease just
setting the cream the ones I go in with
the transition color afterwards it's not
going to drag like my eyeshadow won't
drag on the cream it's just gonna glide
smoothly that's what we want
I'm so excited to be filming from home
right now because it is like 8:37 at
night and I'm more creative at night I
don't know about you guys but night is
when I like all my ideas happen I feel
the most relaxed I feel the most
creative so I love filming late night
the next thing I'm going to do is go in
with Auto Stassi of Beverly Hills a fawn
eyeshadow this is a really nice
transition color I'm going to apply this
with a Mac two to four brush which I
love so I like to tilt my head back a
little bit so I could see my eyeball
socket and
then just run that in the crease what I
like about this eye look is that you
don't have to worry too much about the
lid space because we will be applying a
shadow all over it so if you get a
shadow into that area it's totally fine
so what I like to do is apply the
lightest amount first and just kind of
sweep it to get the shape going you know
I have like a little bit of a shape so I
feel a little bit more ballsy to go in
with more product and I'm just gonna
keep building it I created this eye
makeup look the other night just for fun
sometimes it's nice to do makeup looks
without the camera in front of you when
I'm doing my makeup in front of the
camera it's a totally different
experience it's not like I'm still
thinking a lot about making sure you
guys can see like if I'm holding the
mirror in for them I'm just thinking and
there's times where I just want to do my
makeup and just feel like 100 percent
carefree and hold the mirror just like
this and you know so I like to
experiment sometimes off camera just for
myself and that's why I didn't have this
look filmed but you guys liked it so
much so I'm here filming it I really
liked it too I thought it was really fun
different when I first started um
working a tipsy and I first started like
filming with crispy I remember I saw her
doing the video and she was just doing
her all her makeup in a hand mirror like
this and I thought to myself there's no
way you do your home all your makeup in
that little mirror and she was like yeah
that's how I do it all the time and I
just thought it was so amazing because I
I'm basically inside a large mirror when
I do my makeup well when I used to but
somewhere along the way I started using
her technique and now I can never do my
makeup in any like large mirror I'm
always using this little hand mirror all
the time alright so next I'm going to
pick up a little bit of honest this is
on a saucy Beverly Hills it's actually
an illuminator I think it's for like I'm
not really sure it's orange this is
the color L'Orange would have take just
the tiniest amount of this eyeshadow or
whatever this is highlight and I'm going
to just buff out that crease with it so
lightly I'm barely applying any pressure
so I'm going to go ahead and pick up a
Mac 217 brush and the eyeshadow fudge is
also by Anastasia Beverly Hills I'm
pretty sure all the eyeshadows are from
honest Aussie Beverly Hills today one
tip for smokey eyes where you completely
black out the lid or you know in this
case Brown out the lid what I like to do
first is apply this color into the deep
socket of the crease and blend it first
into the other shadows that we applied
that way when I pack it on to the lid I
don't have to blend afterwards and then
just remove product from the lid with
the blending brush so I like to do that
first it just makes the whole look a lot
neater less fall out so I'm taking it on
a Mac 217 and just putting it into the
crease first and blending it into the
other shades that we laid down kind of
go into a V over here
I'm using the Mac two-to-one brush it's
just a very light fluffy brush and then
buffing out the edges with this this is
a really nice brush to blend edges
because it's so fluffy it's really soft
and not that dense so it gives really
light feathery strokes picking up a
little bit of Morocco by Anasazi of
Beverly Hills very similar to Sienna but
it's just a little bit deeper and I'm
also going to run that along the edges
to warm up the look see how it just kind
of blends out edges so well I just
lightly with the same two-to-one brush
so after you've done that you want to
completely pack on fudge onto the lid so
just get a flat brush and start packing
it on all over the lid say okay boys try
this bye-bye under-eye concealer I'm
pretty sure this isn't my color this is
in the shade tan
it's very brightening nice so if I
didn't mention already I'm using the it
cosmetics bye bye under Ike the
brightness on this under-eye compared to
this one is like whoa so after I've
blended the bye-bye under-eye on I'm
gonna go in with the Maybelline age
rewind this is in the shade neutralizer
this is good for highlighting the face
so I'm just gonna go ahead and put that
on the high points of my cheekbone
because this is a more glamorous look
I'm going full-on anywhere you get
shadows so like around the nose going to
apply it on my forehead here I'm down
the nose I think I just made my nose
look crooked yeah I did that's alright
I'll just uh you can totally skip this
step if it's just like too crazy for you
you're not into it you don't need to go
crazy highlighting I just want to I
don't know what I did before Beauty
blenders like I feel like I can't do my
makeup without a Beauty Blender anymore
then I'm going to go ahead and set
everything using the Laura Mercier
translucent powder so I like to put most
of the powder here in this inner part
first and then blend it into the under
eyes so it's not so much powder under my
eyes because they will get pretty cakey
so before I go back to the eyes I am
going to use a cream to contour my face
I used to use this when I first started
my channel I love this it's the Bobbi
Brown foundation stick in the shade
almond looks like this this color looks
like this I used to use this all the
time to contour back when cream I mean I
guess cream contour is still like a big
thing I don't really do it anymore but I
picked this up the other day just
because I'm like I still have so much
left I want to kind of use it up so I
started using it I really liked how it
looked so I'm just going to do it today
let's look for the cheekbones and then
I'm taking my Beauty Blender of course
blending it upwards so you just want to
kind of push into the skin and upwards
so that you don't just have a line it
starts to like radiate this gives like a
really nice warmth to the skin and up
here just do some designs you know so
now I'm just going to go ahead and of
course Beauty Blender blend it all out
before I finish off the face I'm just
going to go ahead and finish the eye
makeup I'm going back in to Morocco
which is that warm shade that we used in
the crease and I'm going to run this
heavily on the lower lash line I'm using
a slightly fluffier version of a pencil
brush to be honest I don't even know
where this brush is from pencil brush
will do or like just a really small soft
brush next I'm going in with a color pop
liner this is in the shade overboard and
I'm going to run that in the waterline
and I'm also going to heavily run that
on the lower lash line connecting to
this top corner here take it down all
the way down
that's what you want to do is just
define the lower lashline a little bit
more up on the outer part of the eyes so
I'm going in with deep plum by anastacio
Beverly Hills and I'm just taking a
small angled brush this one is Sigma's
small small angled brush I'm going to
connect the top part of the smoky eye in
the lower lash line here I'm taking
Blanc type again this is the color we
used on our brow bone and the same
pencil brush I cleaned it off a little
bit slightly and applying it on the
inner corners of the eye because since
there is so much smokiness going on I do
want to open up the eyes but I don't
want to add shimmer in this area because
I don't want it to take away from the
glitter liner and everything else we
have going on so a matte highlight in
the inner corner works just even loves
this he said that's his favorite part of
my makeup
he loves the inner corner highlight you
get paid-- gel liner by colour-pop just
going to start from the inner corner and
drag it out I'm lightly sketching the
liner first because obviously I'm not
sure if it's gonna all go well for me
right now I don't want to go close to
the lash line because that's where the
black liner is gonna go mapping it out
slightly above where I think my liner is
going to be oh and I'm using a 3:17 Zoe
of a winged liner brush now that we have
the gold liner I'm going to use the
Inglot 77 gel liner this is just black
liner okay I'm just gonna follow this
guideline and just go right underneath
the rose gold liner here now I'm just
going in for the wing this is my
favorite eyeliner brush by the way
so next I kind of just want to define
the outer part of the wing with the gold
and then have it fade into the rose gold
so I'll be using the Jordana cat
eyeliner this is in the shade future
yes girl whoo I'm pretty sure I didn't
breathe that whole time I'm gonna do my
mascara this is the tarte mascara
lights camera flashes like any time my
friends come over and they want like I
let them take a lot of my makeup I'll
let them take whatever mascara but I'm
like you just can't have this one you
already know house of lashes ikonics
okay so you just want to pinch the
lashes together with your natural lashes
but very carefully and then I like to
prop these up a little bit oh okay or
don't the eyes let's go ahead and finish
off the face so I'm going in with Mac
give me Sun and a Mac 168 and I already
laid down the warmth with the Bobbi
Brown I'm just kind of setting it with
this so that just not super creamy on my
jaw line I mean on my contours for a
highlighter today I'll be using the
Becca champagne pop this is Jaclyn Hills
highlighter I can't open it and I'm
really scared to open it cuz I cracked
it shattered it I know I can fix it with
alcohol but like I never get around to
doing it alright so I'm just going to go
ahead into my Tarte blush palette and
I'm going to take this color here I
don't know the color names I'll leave
them in the description box this color
and this color mixed together
last step is going to be the lips and
for that I just used the la girl endless
lip pencil these are one of my favorite
lip pencils especially for over lining
the lips if that's something that you're
into because for some reason these are a
little bit harder and so you can build
them up around the lip line and kind of
just blend them in more with your
natural lip line so I pretty much over
drew my lips that's when I looked so
huge huge this is in the shade a true
Brown
so what you can do with the lip to also
make it appear larger is just kind of do
one of these and then here and I'm just
going to go ahead and fill in the entire
lip with this pencil well she just wants
to be here with me
okay so I'll finish it off with her in
my lap so this is the lip pencil done
this is like bringing your child to work
