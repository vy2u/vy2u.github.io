and I'm super excited because I just got
the anasazi of Beverly Hills
Miah Miah palette and I was so excited
to do a tutorial for you guys I didn't
get around to doing a crazy palette
tutorial but I did use it in a ton of my
tutorials so I thought I'd dedicate a
whole video just using this one palette
a lot of the colors are similar to the
Omri z palette or are 1 2 3 4 5 6 new
shades and this palette has this
beautiful aqua shade that i was really
excited to do and I just pictured this
amazing smokey eye with a really nice
pop of color and so this is what I came
up with I hope you guys enjoy watching
this tutorial and yeah if you guys have
any other requests for videos dedicated
to a certain palette let me know because
I actually had a lot of fun only using
this one so with all of that said let's
get started
alright so the first thing we want to do
is apply a base to our lid this way our
eye shadow appears more vibrant and it
doesn't crease up on us and I'm also
gonna concentrate that in the inner
corner for that pop of aqua just to make
sure it really sticks next I'm going to
apply the vanilla shade from the Miami
appellate onto my brow bone as a
highlight and I'm just gonna blend that
downwards for our transition shade I'm
going to use caramel and I'm gonna pick
that up on a Mac 2 to 4 and any time
you're laying down a transition shade
you want to place that right above the
crease and really really take your time
and diffusing those edges out
on a Mac 217 I'm gonna pick up Siena and
this is the color that I'm really gonna
build up directly into the crease and
since we have that caramel right above
it it's gonna give us a really nice
gradient so I continually pick up more
product and I'm just gonna keep running
that right into my crease giving a round
shape to the eye and then just taking a
two to four and kind of blending out
those edges so for the lid I'm gonna
start packing on deep brown and this is
a really cool toned Brown in the palette
it's almost like a greyish Brown I
really really like it because it
complements the warm tones in the crease
so I'm just packing that on and then
blending out the edges just so it's not
harsh to add a little definition to the
eyes I'm going to use the honest dots to
get Beverly Hills liner in jet and I'm
just gonna apply that to the lash line
and tight line my eye with that as well
and just to make sure that that aqua
really sticks I'm using Sigma's white
liner from the new Glo collection in the
inner corner and then blending it out
just so the Aqua has a nice white base
to really hold on to so I've already
done my foundation in bronzer and to
serve as my concealer I'm using the
Monica dark powder in v2 and I'm just
gonna buff that on my under-eye before I
finish off the eye makeup now it's
finally time for the exciting eye shadow
that I've been dying to try which is the
aqua shade and I'm picking that up on
the brush that comes with the palette
and I'm first lightly blending a small
amount of that around the inner corner
and then I'm just gonna go to town and
start packing that color on until it's
as bright as I want it to be after I'm
all done with that I'm gonna take the
same liner and apply that to the lower
lash line and I'm really gonna drag it
down because I want this looks super
sultry and smoky and I'm going to use a
sigma short shader brush to really just
blend all of that liner out
and then of course we don't want to
leave just a harsh line of liners so I'm
taking a bit of Siena on at 2:17 and
really smoking out that black just a bit
so now it's time for lashes and of
course I'm using my iconic House of
lashes and then I'm gonna apply a little
bit of ICO black magic mascara on top
and on bottom and then I'm gonna also
apply House of lashes precious lashes on
the bottom but I'm gonna do that
off-camera boom there they are time for
my favorite part which is highlighting
I'm using the mary lou manizer by the
balm and i'm applying that with a zoeva
highlighter brush to my cheekbones and
i'm also gonna take my finger and apply
that to the tip of my nose and my
Cupid's bow now I'm going to take this
blush by Illamasqua called lover and I'm
just gonna pop that on to my cheeks for
a nice neutral peachy glow so I first
decided to apply matte close contact but
it was a little bit too nude and so I
use Gerard cosmetics lipstick in the
color nude which is a little bit more
pinky nude and just to add a little bit
more glamour I'm gonna apply this makeup
forever lip gloss it has a little bit of
sparkle in it but it's mostly just very
glossy and clear and for the very last
step of this look I'm taking my mac fix+
and I'm just gonna really basically
bathe in it because it's gonna make your
skin look really nice dewy and flawless
and that is the finished look I hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial
