better than mine sorry hey guys welcome
to my channel so today's video is my
husband to talk so dramatic
basically you guys all wanted me to do a
video where my husband does my makeup
and I want to do it cuz I think it'd be
really funny but I thought to myself
that I've never actually introduced
Steven to you guys on YouTube so we
decided that we take a few of your
questions kind of introduce myself to
you guys and then next week we'll film
the husband does my makeup oh yeah
legitimately scared to do you should be
because you better have my eyebrows
right I don't think I can here I can't
either anyway so basically we asked you
guys on YouTube and Instagram any
questions that you guys had for a Stefan
or myself or our relationship in general
and we're just gonna go ahead and go
through them and answer as many as we
can
I'm a little bit nervous this is my
first time a lot about her this side of
the camera so bear with me and hopefully
we get through all these okay I'll talk
the first question is how did you guys
meet
the way we met is actually a funny story
because let me try to make it a short
version senior year my mom decided that
she wanted to just baby me all of a
sudden and make me lunches every day
with lots of good snacks met this girl
her name was Tina Tina Perkins does she
suck yeah she sat next to me and she
wanted some of my snacks
they were good snacks I made her deal
because I'm street smart like that and I
was like well how about I give you all
my snacks and you let me copy your
homework
aka also let me copy everything else for
the rest of the year one day I told her
how I worked at Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch and
she was like oh my god my brother works
there also when I was like really fun
day I heard someone say Perkins I I had
a girlfriend she had a boyfriend
I wasn't even like into him because he
was just like walking like he was God's
gift and I was like oh he was wearing a
t-shirt that said
I hate my girlfriend okay this is a
funny story then his girlfriend comes
into the store to have lunch with him he
introduces me to his girlfriend and all
of a sudden his shirt said I love my
girlfriend and I was like am i tripping
out like little did I know that he had a
reversible shirt his girlfriend thought
he was like wearing a shirt all day that
said I love my girlfriend that's the
type of guy he was
okay I'm antic hey that was not romantic
anyways I still have that shirt by the
way I kept it that's something that what
made him fall in love with you and you
in love with him well let's start by
saying this was a long time ago you
don't remember but really what attracted
me to desi was her confidence her drive
and her beauty that really led me to
fall in love with her her passion for
everything that she does what's so sweet
and what made you fall for him I don't
know what it was about him specifically
I can't really say we had this type of
bond that I couldn't like step away from
so I think that's what made me fall in
love with him was just like this family
feeling that I had with him from the
very beginning what was your first
impression of each other so I'm gonna go
first
he was so cocky and I mean you were
wearing a shirt that said I hate my
girlfriend yeah no you were absolutely
beautiful how long have you guys been
with each other we have been together
for nine years how long did you guys
date before getting married and did you
ever have any breaks
so we dated for five years before we got
engaged so six years before we got
married a little bit too long if you ask
me but he took forever to ask me you
have a ring
yeah I do now okay I think we had like
one break for six months one like real
break how did you know that you wanted
to marry each other basically for me the
strongest bond is like family and so
once I felt that with him I knew that I
want to marry him you know we became our
own family and that's when you really
know yeah what's your favorite part of
the wedding and I would have to say that
it was definitely the first time I saw
desi walking down the aisle if any of
you have seen the actual wedding video I
think I haven't
mom tube will link it below I mean I was
in tears when I first saw her and it was
one of the best things that I've ever
seen and a moment that I will never
forget so thanks so sweet I'm getting
all the motion I had two best parts
obviously seeing Stephen the very
special moment that I shared with my dad
walking down the aisle and the moment
right before like it was just a really
nice moment to have with him my dad and
Stephen the two important men in my life
plus my three brothers that I love so
much don't forget them where did you
guys go on your honeymoon ah PG PG what
is something that surprised you after
marriage something you weren't expecting
or something you do not know about
marriage so we lived together for at
least five we are good five years going
into marriage so we had lived together
so I knew everything all right no
surprises no surprises everything hidden
any tips for newlyweds tips for
newlyweds I mean really the only tips
that we have for newlyweds is yeah I
think that you need to have your own
hobbies your own life and also have a
life with your spouse because spending
too much time together I mean you're
living with this person for the rest of
your life so make sure that you have
something of your own that you can spend
time doing during our marriage what had
to be the hardest moment for both of you
and how did you guys get past it the
hardest moment in our marriage would
have to be when desi and I were about to
have a baby and we had told all of our
friends our family everyone knew and
then we had the miscarriage that was
definitely the hardest it was the
hardest part I mean it's still very
tough and you can't words can't explain
how you feel when you go through
something like that I mean as a husband
it's it's very hard to relate to the
wife because you don't know what's going
on you're you're not the one that was
holding a baby in your body I think it
was just like the worst thing that ever
happened in my life
in general and I think like what Steven
said as a woman you feel like your
husband or whoever you're supposed to
have that child with it they don't
really understand the feelings I felt
alone I felt like by myself even though
I wasn't clearly I had him but we fought
a lot because I just felt like he didn't
get it and it was just happening to me
and it wasn't happening to him even
though it definitely was and it caused
like a lot of tension between us but we
got past it and I think now it made us a
lot stronger that's for sure we just
kind of grew from it we both just became
even more like a sister to the
challenges that you go through as a
couple that really once you pull through
them that bring you closer together can
we get some light and airy questions in
here shits your most embarrassing moment
in front of each other we we let it all
out there and there's nothing like okay
there's nothing behind we don't get
embarrassed I mean I don't really get
that embarrassed and I think first of
all he doesn't get embarrassed for
anything and then me I grew up with all
brothers so I have no boundaries like oh
well who wears the pants in the
relationship so I would say that this
strong Latina woman that I married she's
very bossy who said I love you first um
I said I love you first because I loved
I was never gonna say I love you first
all something that much I'm stubborn
what is your get over an argument
solution what is your favorite date
slash place to go together the movies
the movies has Stephen always supported
your dream of being a beauty guru yeah
he supports everything I do he takes my
ootds
he he's really cute like he tracks my
statistics he reads my comments he he's
just really good about it
one word that describes one another
fierce oh I like that word um caring
what are three things that you have in
common with your husband we are like
polar opposites you guys no joke we are
the definition of opposites attract
like he listens to like closing time and
I listen to like dirty hip that is uh
what is yours and Stevens best memory
together uh I would have to say our
wedding yeah I am down hey can you do
impressions of each other like you
nagging at him and vice versa I can do
you real quick okay even are you even
listening to me
I just posted on Instagram have you even
liked it yet even why are there so many
piles all over the house and what's for
dinner I'd say that's pretty accurate
he does not nag ever so do you both
speak fluent Spanish me español es muy
mal yo comprendo espanol pero me
hablando si yo si puedo hablar español
muy bien pero hay mal vida como habla
espanol what are some things that you do
to each other that annoys each other
takes a lot to annoy me
as you can see via snapchat and I put up
every yeah everyone thinks that I annoy
him a lot on snapchat like how could I
don't doesn't get annoying but he just
doesn't really doesn't he'll have a
piece of trash he'll pick up that piece
of trash and he'll put that piece of
trash on the counter or in the sink even
though the trashcan is right there how
comfortable are you around him with no
makeup you it's very comfortable
do you prefer her with or without makeup
I think she's beautiful both ways I mean
I've seen her without makeup and with
makeup and she's how long did you go
without showing him what you looked like
without makeup I mean I don't think you
had much makeup on when I met you no
makeup ever an issue hair extensions on
the other hand it was just see I didn't
I didn't know what hair extensions were
I'm sorry sentience
are so lonely he didn't know what hit
him
because let me tell you guys have funny
stories I remember one day he decided to
like come over when I was in the shower
hair was wet and I was like oh my god my
extensions aren't in so I went like
above and beyond and I clipped in my
extensions and wet them so that it
looked like it was my hair I didn't know
this until right now you didn't know
that oh my god yeah I did that once what
do I do for a living

me she doesn't I will snatch her hair
back so quick just with this motion they
call me the snatcher
oh is it awkward for you that does he is
exposed to the public no it's not look
well yes it's not awkward at all what's
the craziest and most daring thing that
you guys have done together so lame that
like this sneaking into the movies is
like the only thing I know so I so our
first date uh I took desi to Islands
cheapo I mean we were young this is like
we fresh out of high school recently
hammers knock into a movie and we snuck
and do a movie Cars super daring how

think Steven just knows how to take
pictures to where I look many tall and
all or kylie huh let a questions
question who would you go for Kendall he
doesn't even know I don't even know he
doesn't even know who Kendall or Kylie
are do I have any brothers and sisters
yes I have one brother and one sister my
sister's younger and my brother's older
what do you love most about him he is
super caring he just does all those
things that a gentleman should do and
I'm really big on that because my dad is
from Texas and he is very much so a
gentleman so I really have high
standards for guys to also be like that
did you wait to have sex until after the
wedding Jesus says I know has Stephen
always been into Latina women or just
you know I can't answer for myself won't
let me okay hey okay Rose before me
there was a white girl do you know each
other's favorite drink order

front of him were you shy at first yeah
I think at first when I started making
videos I was like can you turn around it
was a it was a process I was like are
you looking at me don't look at me I did
not feel comfortable and not that I
don't feel comfortable around how I feel
right now yeah it's my first video he's
really uncomfortable when you guys like
you have no idea
mm-hmm how many times have you thrown
your extensions at him lately it's
becoming a more reoccurring theme go
with it would you say your husband is
your number one Supporter yes 100% how
many children do you plan on having I'd
say two or three is a good number ones
just not enough force to many to minimum
and maximum both make a stunning couple
but what are your favorite features of
each other say my favorite features of
desi are her her eyes
and her eyelashes and lips my eyelashes
do I love her eyelash just a little
that's what I love I love him I love his
hair I actually love his lips too I
always was like attracted to his lips
do you guys fart in front of each other
how do I deal with desease makeup
addiction we have a spare bedroom and it
kind of just all goes and that that's
not to say that I don't bring my makeup
downstairs in the living room and get
ready next to him while he's watching TV
because I like to be around people so I
kind of just have things everywhere do
we fight oh sorry but when I edit this
it's gonna be the log you didn't finish
reading the question really stop it no
no so no don't even do that ever again
everybody fights you guys like everyone
for no matter how perfect a couple looks
everybody fights I don't you know how to
cook and you ever plan on learning so
people now think I don't know how to
cook because of a snapchat that I put up
desi cooks for me we cook each other
dinner we take turns she's actually a
very good cook it took her a while at
first but uh look a couple birdie rigs
let's be real hearing I do know how to
cook do I love to cook no he loves to
cook so I mean who kisses ask first
whenever you get into an argument um
this guy I'm stubborn and I will ride it
out until as long as possible what is
the one thing he knows that pushes your
buttons not listening is a big one oh
yeah
what's his shoe size 12 yes we all know
what you're asking one bad habit that
you have that your husband wishes he
could change and vice versa I wish she'd
stop sticking her damn eyelashes all
over the place I don't really think
that's the big of a deal
one thing I would wish about you bad
habit piles
I don't know if piles upset you're
making me sound like a hoarder you are a
low-key hoarder I'll have like a stack
of stuff there then in the corner of the
kitchen he'll put like a stack of stuff
there it tell us something that would
surprise us about desi desi is a tomboy
at heart and I think that might be very
surprising to some of you guys is now
you're like this beauty guru do you guys
fart in front of each other if your
answer is no we don't think about this
what if you're farting when you're
sleeping you don't even know about it
well our answer is definitely not know
so it's very natural just go with it you
know what was the first song at our
wedding I feel so close to you right now

booty out of the tooth he has the better
booty it describe each other with five
words ready go fun artistic fierce
