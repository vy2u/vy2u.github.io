for today's tutorial I'm going to be
doing this look right here it is kind of
like a mermaid tail slash fish I quickly
wanted to mention that Urban Decay
actually sent me these at new eyeshadows
and letting you guys know they did send
them to me but I asked them if I could
have some of the products used in this
video to do a giveaway for you guys I
mentioned before that I would love to do
a giveaway that was international so
this giveaway will be open
internationally I hope you guys enjoy
this tutorial and if you're interested
in this mermaid ish then keep on
watching I'm gonna start the look off by
priming my lids and I'm gonna use the
Urban Decay primer potion tis in the
shade Eden which is a little bit lighter
it's gonna cancel out all these red
tones in my eyes take the shade foxy and
this is from the Urban Decay Naked 2
palette that I have here it's just this
really nice bone color but this bone
color shade and you guys know I like to
set my face with this just so that it's
easier to blend and we're gonna be using
a lot of bright and dark colors today so
you want to make sure that you have all
the help you can get as far as being
easy to blend so I'm going in to the
Urban Decay vice 2 palette and I'm going
to take this shade right here it's
called rewind and this is gonna serve as
our transition shade in the crease
so now I'm going to go ahead and take a
black eyeshadow this one is black out
and I'm gonna direct this right into the
crease like right where your socket line
is try to keep it contained and not
bringing up the block too high because
that's when you look like a panda
so I'm trying my hardest to keep the
block nice and contained in the crease
after I'm done building up the black in
the crease I'm going to apply a black
base to my lid you guys can use a creamy
eyeliner or whatever you have and I'm
just gonna focus this mostly in the
center of the eye sometimes when you use
a black face underneath release sparkly
eyeshadows it makes them pop even more
which kind of seems crazy but it does
maybe that's not the best product okay
so that eyeliner wasn't really doing
what I wanted it to do so I'm gonna use
this black gel liner and I'm focusing
this on the center because the center is
where I'm gonna put a really nice
translucent shade so I wanted to pop a
little bit more I'm gonna mix the shade
damaged right here which is this really
pretty emerald green color and prank and
prank is like a blue but it has a specks
of green glitter in it so I'm gonna mix
those two together so I dampen my brush
I mix those two colors and I'm gonna
apply it on the outer portion and the
inner portion of my eye so don't worry
too much about blending it yet just kind
of pack that color on so it's nice and
opaque I know you guys are seeing a lot
of like Valentine's Day looks and Here I
am with this like really intense mermaid
tail smokey eye it's okay if you have
some fallout I haven't applied concealer
yet so it's all good we're gonna apply
this new eyeshadow by Urban Decay it's
called solstice this color is so pretty
because it looks purple at first but
then it reflects green so again I took
my damp brush and I'm just gonna pop it
into that and we're gonna pop this in
the center of the eye
and if you guys can see it has like just
the most like little microbe litter it's
like super refined and it just looks wet
almost so I'm gonna go back into praying
after my lid and put a little bit of
that into the crease just to tie the
blues together so it's not just black
I'm just gonna lightly buff that in to
the crease see so now it looks a little
bit more blue kind of ties in a little
bit better so I'm gonna go back into
that dark blue shade on a smaller brush
and just give myself just a little bit
more depth on the outer corners just a
little bit on right here
I have a lot of fallout under my eyes
I'm just gonna take a little make-up
wipe a little like there's different
sizes just a makeup wipe and I'm gonna
clean up that area before I finish off
the eyes I'm gonna do my concealer and
I'm going to use this new one from Urban
Decay this one is called naked skin
weightless complete coverage concealer
so this concealer has a demi matte
finish and it's not supposed to settle
into your fine lines so I'm using the
shade medium light and I'm just gonna
pop that on then I'm just gonna take a
brush and lightly blend that out
set the under eyes I'm gonna use the
Naked Skin Ultra Definition powder
foundation by urban decay this is also
new the packaging is really really
pretty so I'm just gonna take a little
bit of that and kind of set the
under-eye area this is actually a
foundation so you can set your whole
face with this or just use this as your
foundation without liquid to finish off
the eyes we're gonna start working on
the lower lash line I'm gonna go ahead
and line my eyes with this liner pencil
it's in the shade deep end can you guys
imagine if I named this Valentine's Day
date night makeup this is the kind of
makeup that you wear up to the club
alright so that's pretty bold
now I'm gonna blend that out you guys
can blend it out with a pencil brush
prank shade this one right here I'm
gonna pop that on to the outer corners
as well the lower lash line
give us some depth so I'm just lightly
blending that into the lower lash line
fading it into the inner corner next I'm
going to use the shade cosmic this is
another one of the new eyeshadow color
I'm just gonna pop this one on to the
inner corners of my eyes because I
shadows are interesting they feel like a
cream but they go on like a powder so
we're about to highlight this area
pretty pretty bright
and now it's time for some mascara and I
pretty much just wear mascara to prep my
lashes for falsies it's really gonna
ground this look since we have a lot of
blue is the lashes so I'm just gonna go
ahead and pop on false lashes false
lashes on the top and bottom of my eyes
and then for the lips pick a nude
lipstick or a pinky nude anything that
you guys have because like I said the
eyes are the star and that is the final
looks alright guys so that is the end of
this tutorial and this is the finished
makeup look I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this tutorial I actually love
the way this looks and I say actually
only because you guys know him like a
neutrals baby and I love neutrals all
day every day
this is stepping outside of my comfort
zone but I love the way it looks it's
just so fun and bright I think that's
about everything if you guys like this
