so today I decided to decided where that
axe ain't home for all I was starting to
do a metallic smokey eye I wanted to use
a lot of pigments and then all of a
sudden like this green liner popped up
out of nowhere
and I really like how it looks I think
it's really different and fun I dig it
so I hope you guys enjoy this tutorial
let's get started so I'm gonna start by
putting my hair up and out of my face I
apologize that my hair is wet in this
video
I've actually been trying not to heat
dial it because I've been using this
Brio Gio and don't despair repair hair
mask to replenish and just make my hair
a little bit healthier from the bleach
and then of course before I touch my
face with my hands I'm gonna go ahead
and wash them and then I'm gonna apply
this Mitchell and peach hand lotion just
to soften my hands before applying my
makeup moving on to the eyes I'm just
applying a bone colored shadow to my
brow bone as my highlight and this is
max Balaam type and I've already prepped
my lids with Mac soft ochre prior to
filming I got this NYX eye shadow in the
shade and Velvet in my glam bag this
month and this is gonna be the perfect
transition shade for our smokey eye
because it's easy to build color upon
this and its really nicely pigmented so
I'm just gonna put that in my crease
with a Mac two to four I want a really
dark base for this look so I'm using NYX
gel liner and I'm just gonna apply that
to my lid with a makeup geek concealer
brush and after I've done that I'm
taking a black eye shadow this is
blackout by urban decay and I'm gonna
pack it on to the lids now taking a Mac
217 I'm gonna use the color Sienna from
Anastasia Beverly Hills it's a very warm
brown and I'm just gonna run that
through the crease and then I'm going to
take a map 2 to 4 and blend out those
edges and continue those steps until
it's nicely blended next you want to
take a black eyeliner I'm using this one
by Lord and berry and I'm gonna apply
that to my waterline and drag it down a
fairly low I kind of feel like it's safe
to apply my concealer now since I've
used all the black eye shadows for the
most part
so I'm just gonna apply my NARS creamy
concealer in the color custard and after
that I'm going to blend out that black
liner with a little bit more sienna and
a Mac 217 I'm gonna take this pigment by
Mac it's called old gold and I love it
it's kind of an antiquey color I'm gonna
apply that to my tear duct and since I
have a block underneath it it's gonna
make it pop a lot more next I'm taking
Mac copper sparkle and I'm gonna apply
that with a sigma shader brush to the
center of the lid and I damp into the
brush just a bit to give it a little bit
more intensity and I want to focus most
of the intensity in the center and then
blend those outer edges out so that the
color is like I said mostly in the
center of your lid and I'm just blending
out the edges of that copper Sparkle
into the black so it's not so harsh to
highlight my lower lash line i'm also
gonna apply the copper sparkle right in
the center and just to make everything
pop i'm gonna apply a little bit more
black eyeshadow to the lower lash line
and the outer V of my eye so you can
definitely stop this look here and just
apply lashes but I'm gonna go in with
this Lime Crime liner in the color
chartreuse it was seriously calling my
name I was so excited to use it because
I just got it and I love how it looks I
found that I had to put two layers on
because I had so much pigment and black
eye shadow but once I did that it looked
really really nice and it just made
everything pop and to finish off the
eyes i'm applying my house of lashes in
the style iconic and i'm just gonna add
a little bit of mascara to them and the
eyes are done moving on to the face i've
already applied my foundation it's the
Mac Studio Fix powder and NC 35 and I
mixed a little bit of NC 45 as well or
NW 45 as well and I'm just kind of
putting a little bit more over the spots
that I got a little shiny under these
hot lights now I'm gonna set my
concealer with honest hacia Beverly
Hills banana powder under the eyes and I
used a zoeva highlighter brush for this
to warm up the skin I'm using Mac's give
me Sun and this is my favorite I guess
you would call it a transition shade for
your contour exactly what we do with the
eye shadow you want to do that with the
face too so that you don't just have one
dark harsh line you want it to gradually
fade so this is first gonna give me an
all-over base tan and then you can go in
with a darker contour shade and apply
that just to the outer portions of your
cheekbones and it's really just gonna
make our contour overall blend a lot
nicer and I know this is a lot of steps
but now I'm taking my betty lou manizer
by the balm and i'm gonna apply that to
the places where I put my contour this
is just a bronzy highlighter sheet and
it's just gonna give you a really nice
tan and glow alright so now it's time to
highlight and this is my first time
using the Becca opal highlighter and as
you can see I maybe maybe just added a
little too much highlighter to my face
but it's okay lesson to learn next time
I'll go a little lighter on that
highlight but I absolutely love this
highlighter actually Jaclyn hill made me
buy it with her favorites video girls
got me going all over Sephora buying
stuff but anyways now moving on to the
blush I'm using the balm blush and this
is called Swiss dot and this is very
pigmented it's a very peachy coral shade
so I'm just gonna apply a tad bit of
that and blend it out so it's not too
bright and out of control like my
highlighter lastly we're gonna finish
off the look with the lips I'm gonna
line my lips with this lip liner from
Make Up For Ever in the color 3 C it's
very close to my natural lip shade and
then I'm taking lime crimes lipstick in
the colour Coquette which is such a
beautiful peachy nude but it may have
looked a little bit too light for my
skin tone at the moment because I'm a
little bit tan but nonetheless I still
would have chosen nude lipstick for this
I look
so that is it for this makeup tutorial I
hope you guys enjoyed this video give it
a thumbs up if you did and I'll see you
guys in my next tutorial welcome to my
channel
