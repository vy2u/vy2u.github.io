back skin is so dry I need coffee
luckily we can fix this so let's get
started I'm going to start by applying
warm water to my face to open the pores
then take your favorite face wash and
apply it to your face in circular
motions to reveal radiant skin and get
the blood flowing I'm going to now
exfoliate my skin in order to lock in
moisture and keep my skin nice and
hydrated
now it's time to get rid of those dark
circles and puffy eyes by applying a
moisturizing eye cream I'm going to
apply a skin serum to ensure bright even
skin tone and I'm just patting this into
the skin now to finish off the skin
apply a moisturizing day cream that has
SPF
now I know some of us may be dehydrated
due to weakened activities so make sure
you apply a lip balm that hydrates your
lips to get started with the skin we are
going to use benefits Porefessional to
ensure our makeup stays on all day
I'm going to go in with my tart tinted
moisturizer and apply that to make these
just using my fingers I feel this
product works best this way it just
warms into the skin and leads the
beautiful skin leg texture now in order
to cover any spots or pimp as you may
have I'm using my dermablend concealer
and just patting that on those areas
I'm using my Kevin a Kwan skin enhancer
under the eyes to get rid of any dark
circles that I still have leftover from
the weekend I'm going to Pat that on
first with a brush and then use my
fingers to make it blend better
now it's time for our brows so I'm going
to use a wax to get all the hairs in
place and then I'm going to go in with
my Too Faced bulletproof brows and a
matte 263 brush and start feathering in
the product very lightly making sure to
only go in the direction of hair growth
that way the brows look as natural as
possible and I'm going to keep building
until I get the brow that I would like
and I'm concentrating most of the
product on the outer end of my brows
because I have very little to no growth
in that area
and that is the brow so whatever is left
over I'm going to just feather upwards
in the beginning of the brows you don't
want to keep this area too harsh or
box-like to finish the brows off I'm
going to take my Aiko brow gel and just
run that through my brows using as
little product as possible to keep them
looking nice and natural
and those are the brow is done it's time
to lift the brows to make us look more a
week so I'm going to use my two-faced
brow lift pen and I'm just going to
apply that to the brow bone and blend it
down with my finger now I'm taking
Maybelline Color tattoo in bold goals
and I'm applying this just with my
finger as a base I'm going to take this
copper and gold eyeshadow from Inglot
and I'm going to mix them together and
just create a wash of the color over my
lid nothing too fancy because it is a
Monday and most of us are in a rush so
we're going to keep this look fairly
simple
make sure you curl your lashes because
this will also make you look more awake
and bright-eyed apply your favorite
mascara and just build it up as much as
you want I have very small lashes so I'm
going to go ahead and pop on some
falsies you can totally skip the step if
you have full lashes but I love drama
and I always love to wear lashes take a
translucent powder I'm using Makeup
Forever HD and apply that everywhere you
applied concealer just to make sure it
stays all day now I'm going to take
Mac's mineralize skinfinish in gold
deposit and I'm going to buff that
around my face not contouring or
anything just kind of giving me a warm
glow apply a pink blush to the apples of
your cheek I'm using stay pretty by Mac
and this is just going to bring a life
to your face
now use a highlighter I'm using whisper
of guilt and apply it to the high points
of your face so the tops of your cheeks
and maybe down the bridge of your nose
and on your Cupid's bow this will give
us the appearance of a radiant and dewy
skin
choose a color that you want to make
your face pop so I'm lining my lips with
Mac ablaze lip pencil and then I'm going
to go in with Too Faced lipstick in the
color bonbon and apply that to the lips
now I love this lipstick because it's
super hydrating and it gives you a nice
glossy finish I decided to add a little
definition under my eye by using Mac
Brown script last minute now to set
everything we're going to apply Mac
Studio Fix just give our skin a nice
spray for more hydration
