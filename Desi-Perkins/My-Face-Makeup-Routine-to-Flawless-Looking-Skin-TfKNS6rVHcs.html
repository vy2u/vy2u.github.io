favorite foundation I'm using Makeup
Forever HD in the shade 123 just place
that over your skin with your fingers
now I'm dampening a glamor princess
beauty sponge and pushing the product
into my skin you really want to work the
product in with a dabbing motion because
you get the most coverage this way and
it just really melts into the skin
giving you an airbrushed finish
just in my forehead and since that area
is a little bit smaller I like to use a
small stippling brush for this I just
have more control this way and I can
really push the product into my hairline
whatever product is left over on the
brush I'm just gonna go ahead and sweep
over any areas just to blend further all
about blending you guys will see that in
this video I just blend blend blend I'm
using my makeup addiction brush to blend
out my Tarte creaseless concealer this
is one of my favorite concealers I
absolutely love it I'd say I use it the
most but if you guys want an alternative
I also love Mac Pro Longwear concealer I
think that's also just an amazing
concealer make sure you blend it into
your foundation and just use the dabbing
motion and this helps that your
concealer and everything doesn't crease
whatever is leftover on my brush now I'm
just gonna use to brighten the forehead
and the bridge of my nose now I'm using
Mac prep and prime pen in bright
forecast and I'm just further
highlighting under the eye also down the
bridge of my nose and this will give my
nose a slimmer more refined effect
and of course lend it out blend blend
blend I like to use these dabbing
motions where I want to concentrate the
product to the most and then I like to
use feathering motions to just blend
that product out in the rest of my skin
go ahead and take a foundation that's
just a few shades darker than your skin
tone I'm using a Bobbi Brown in the
color almond and you guys can use any
foundation you'd like I just love this
one because it gives obviously not a
natural but more of a soft contour which
is what I'm going for
I'm using a 130 stippling brush from Mac
and I'm just blending that product
upwards make sure that you don't blend
down because you really want to keep the
sharp the sharp line to give you that
really chiseled appearance on your
cheekbones I'm actually dabbing the
excess product on the back of my hand so
that I don't have any extra product
blend that into the hairline and the
temples as well I love this shade
because it gives more of a soft warm
sunny glow and of course if you want
more of a contour you can use a darker
shade one that's not so warm it's all
about finding the right shade for you it
really doesn't matter what foundation
you're using I'm just picking up my
concealer brush and whatever's left over
on it and just sharpening the one
under that contour take a fluffy
blending brush and blend out that
foundation on your nose this really
helps with people who have maybe a
little bit of a slight bump or a crooked
nose or if your nose is a little bit
wider than you'd like you can really
contour it and shape it out I'm using
Maryland's baby powder to just set my
concealer and brighten under the eye I
love brightening am all about
brightening you guys haven't noticed now
I know that this beauty powder is
limited edition and I'm gonna be really
sad when it runs out but also make up
for ever HD really works well they have
the nice translucent powder that you
guys could use or any translucent powder
actually is good for this I've also used
a lighter powder to do this like just by
a powder that's a few shades lighter
than your skin tone that also really
works set anywhere you put concealer
it's very important I'm taking NYX matte
bronzer to set everywhere I did that
contour with a darker foundation and
this doesn't only help set but it also
deepens your contour and really helps
with blending as well
I'm concentrating most if the bronzer in
the hollows of my cheeks but see how I'm
going up into more of a triangle shape
right there because that makes it look a
little bit more natural and really helps
blend out that contour you also really
want to put it on your temples and make
sure you sweep it into the hairline go
ahead and take your favorite powder I'm
using rimmel's sandstorm to set
everything that you've done I love this
powder because it's not super heavy
coverage it's just a really light veil
and it looks really natural which I like
I'm going in with motives blush in the
color Empress and I'm using the same
brush that I used for my bronzer and I'm
placing it on the apples of my cheeks
and working it up towards my temple and
really blending it into the bronzer
I feel like you don't want to see the
difference between the blush and the
bronzer too much it should blend
seamlessly just like eyeshadows in your
crease would use your favorite
highlighter I'm using Mac's soft and
gentle and a stippling brush and place
it on the higher portions of your
cheekbones
now take a smaller blending brush and
use that same highlighter down the
bridge of your nose and on your Cupid's
bow set with a setting spray i'm using
mac's fix+ and you're done I hope you
