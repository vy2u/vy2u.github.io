my date night out so if you like what
you see then keep on watching I'm going
to start by applying max long type all
over the brow bone and pulling it down
towards the crease and this is going to
be our highlight color now I'm going to
pick up makeup geeks Coco bear and I'm
going to add this as my transition shade
into the crease and this is just going
to allow for all our other shadows to
blend seamlessly into the brow bone
picking up this beautiful pink shade
from the Jessie's girl tickled pink
palette that I got in my Ipsy glam bag
I'm gonna go ahead and pack that onto
the lid until it's super opaque picking
up this burgundy shade I am going to
concentrate this to the outer portion of
my eye and sort of blend it upwards now
for this look I want a really sultry
effect so I'm gonna pick up my black
L'Oreal liner and I'm gonna start
roughly drawing out my cat eye and don't
worry about it being super perfect
because we're just gonna smudge this out
I'm just applying a bit of that burgundy
shade on the top here just to smoke it
out further now picking up my Inglot gel
liner I'm going to use this to define
the eyes and we want to put this as
close to the lash line as possible
however we want to keep the very top of
it smoked out to give us that sultry
effect I'm gonna go back in with my
pencil liner and just define my
waterline to give my eyes a bronzed
effect I'm going to apply this tinny
Beauty cream shadow in the color spiced
rum to my lower lash line going back
into my Jessie's Girl palette I'm gonna
pick up this really pretty highlight
color and apply it to the inner corners
of my eyes I want to give my eyes I
really flirty feel tonight so I'm going
to go ahead and pop on these Jane Kat
lashes now that we're done with the eyes
it's time to move on to our face I've
already applied foundation so what I'm
doing now is applying my Mac prep and
bright in bright forecast
and I'm just going to apply it under the
eyes and down the bridge of my nose to
brighten these areas up picking up my
city color be matte blush I'm going to
apply that to the cheeks giving me that
perfectly matte finish take your
favorite highlighter and apply that to
the very top of your cheekbones now I'm
going to take my Too Faced lipstick in
the color taffy and apply that to the
lips to finish the look off I'm going to
take my pop Beauty lip gloss and peony
petal and this is a plumping lip gloss
so it's gonna make our lips look nice
and pissah Bowl whoops almost forgot
mascara the one I'm using here is by
Elizabeth Mott and this one really
separates and thickens your lashes it's
my favorite now of course we all want a
smell good so I'm gonna apply my
Pacifica guava body butter to add that
finishing touch and now you're ready to
go on your date or Haven girls night
whatever you're doing I hope you guys
are having a good Valentine's Day love
you and I'll see you in my next video
