and this has to be one of my most
requested suggestions down in the
comments and also on my Instagram so a
lot of you guys wanted to know what my
skincare routine was so I'm going to go
ahead and do a quick video on what I use
and a little bit of history on my skin
so if you guys are interested keep on
watching so my skin just so you guys
know hasn't always been clear I actually
used to struggle with it a lot and I
never really necessarily had acne
although in my mind I thought I did
because I would get at least seven
pimples on my face at once and it was
really weighing down on me so finally my
husband got me a facial and I decided to
get the microdermabrasion now if you
guys aren't familiar with what that is I
will definitely put a link down below
but basically it helps smooth your face
out fine lines wrinkles acne scars
pimples it helps with everything it just
removes all the dead skin and basically
it'll give you a fresh start um so I
went ahead and did that and I sat down
with the facialist to talk to her about
what I could do to improve my skin and
she basically told me that the face wash
I was using at the time which was
Clearasil was too strong for my face and
it was actually making matters worse so
she told me to get something more gentle
and she said Cetaphil was amazing so I
went to Target right away and I picked
up a few things from Cetaphil so I'm
going to go ahead and show you what I
use now okay
alright so first when I went okay
alright so first off I went to Target
and I picked up set of Phil's
daily facial cleanser and this is for
normal to oily skin which is perfect for
me because I pretty much have normal
skin all over except the t-zone does get
a little bit oily for me through
a day so I picked up this face wash it
says that it removes surface oils dirt
and makeup without leaving skin tight or
overly dry which is really a big thing
for me because the other face washes I
was using was leaving my skin really dry
it rinses clean without leaving any port
plugging residue and it's gentle enough
for everyday use so I've been using this
for months and months now I've
repurchased it a lot of times and I'm
obsessed with this face wash it just I
mean I don't even know how to explain it
but my skin has completely transformed
100% so I love this second thing I
picked up from target was the Cetaphil
daily facial moisturizer now this has
SPF 15 and it's for all skin types it
smoothes hydrates and protects and it's
lightweight non-greasy fragrance free
UVA UVB protection so basically after I
wash my face I apply this to my face
won't still damp that's what she the
dermatologists suggest that I do so I've
been doing that and both of these items
together have basically transformed my
skin and I'm sure that the facial had
something to do with it because it gave
me a fresh canvas to start with but for
the most part since my skin was bad
these are the only two things I've been
using and they have literally changed my
life I haven't really had any major
breakouts since and maybe when it's that
time of the month I'll get like one tiny
pimple but before I would just break out
everywhere so I would really say that I
owe my skin to the facial and these two
products so I realized that these two
products alone were really good to get
my skin back to what I wanted it to be
however at my age I needed a
night cream that was good for anti-aging
and you know what you want to start
using those things when you're around 22
so now I picked up this lumi a it is the
intense rejuvenation cream and it's
really thick and it has a really nice
consistency it has amazing scent it kind
of makes you feel like you're having a
spa treatment or something and um I
absolutely love this I've been using it
for a couple months now and I haven't
noticed any breakouts or anything else
my skin has stayed the same except when
I wake up in the morning I feel like my
skin's really plump and I love that so I
definitely love this night cream and I
only use this at night it's actually for
daytime or nighttime but I feel like
when you're sleeping that's when your
skin absorbs the most product so that's
when I really wear my good product so I
love this okay now I wasn't using an eye
cream for the longest time a lot of you
guys asked me what I cream I use and
honestly I was using one from Sephora
and I found it was way too heavy for my
under eye area it was actually making me
have like little white head breakouts I
guess um it was just too heavy because
your skin is so delicate under the eye
so I just recently started using this I
can't give you guys a 100% review on
this because I just started using it but
um so far so good I really like it and
it's the tarte cosmetics sea brightener
eye treatment it has a really good
consistency it's not too thick and
doesn't really have much of a scent this
is specifically to brighten the
under-eye so if you have dark circles
and you want to kind of brighten that
area and you guys know me I'm all about
brightening the under-eye
so I love this and I'm hoping with time
that it will still continue to be good
to me and I'll let you guys know maybe
on Instagram how I'm feeling about this
now at least once a week you guys should
be exfoliating your skin because you
tend to build up dry skin dead skin and
you really want to get rid of all of
that once a week at least and I just
started this as well I started using
neat art double detox Amazonian clay
face mask and this is an exfoliating
face mask and basically you just take a
dime size a dime sized amount of this
and it has little beads and you just
circular motions rub it around your face
and then you leave it until it dries or
I leave it for about 15 minutes and then
I just rinse it off with for mode I
really feel like I need a mouse because
even though my skin has cleared up I
still struggle with clogged pores around
the nose area and so I feel like a mask
really helps get that out
so this I didn't make my skin feel dry
tight or like some masks make you feel
like it strips all of the oils from your
face and I don't really like that
because your skin needs those oils to
stay hydrated and some oil is good for
you I really really like this now last
but not least my holy grail on the spa
pimple treatment this is the Mario go
disco drying lotion
now everything from Mario buhdeuce goes
line if I'm even saying that right I'm
not sure but um everything that he makes
is amazing I mean I haven't tried
anything that I don't necessarily not
like but for sure as far as skincare
this is my most used product and I can't
live without this if you guys ever get
just that horrible pimple right before
an event this works miracles on it it
will literally reduce it so much
overnight and what you do is you take a
q-tip and you dip it all the way down
into this pink powder here and you pull
it right back up and you just dab it on
the areas that you
a breakout you go to sleep and when you
wake up in the morning you just wash
your face as normal they will be
significantly reduced I love this and I
was so happy to say I haven't needed it
in a while but when I do I always make
sure to have this handy you guys need to
pick this up Harper if you want to be in
my video all right guys I hope you
enjoyed this video I really really do
hope that some of these techniques or
products work for you guys I know
everyone has different skin so it might
not work for some people but I just want
this to at least give you hope that if
you do have bad skin it can get better
and thank you so much for your beautiful
comments about my skin it means the
world to me because I did struggle with
it so much I really hope these things
help you guys of course any questions

personal questions feel free to comment
