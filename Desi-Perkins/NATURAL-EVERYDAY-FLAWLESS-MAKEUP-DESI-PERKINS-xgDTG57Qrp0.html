to create a look that was a soft more so
everyday glam everybody has a different
representation of what everyday glam is
but for me it's usually a natural finish
radiant skin look very fresh and I want
to say a huge thank you to nurse for
partnering with me in this video to
share with you guys everything you need
to know about the new foundation which
is also my current favorite foundation
and aside from it being a video partner
with them this 100% genuinely has been
my favorite foundation so far in a very
very long time and I've been wearing it
non-stop you guys have seen it my few
recent videos and on my Instagram pics
Linares natural radiant long wear
foundation and as you guys can see here
this was the little PR package they sent
it was so exciting to see such an
inclusive shade range which is
incredible and I'm gonna swatch some of
the shades for you guys in the video as
well we're just gonna go ahead and hop
into the tutorial first things first
we're starting off with my current
favorite foundation of the new NARS
natural radiant long wear foundation it
definitely has all those things like I
said I've been wearing this for I I
think going by my Instagram pictures
like the last two months so when they
reached out to me to work with me and
partnered with me on this video I said
yeah yeah I said yes since there is such
a large shade range I'm gonna go ahead
and swatch the darkest shade the
lightest shade and then my shade which I
would say is a medium shade so this is
Molly let's do the medium shade right
next to that which I use Barcelona and
then we're gonna swatch Oslo which is a
fair shade their deepest medium shade
which is my shade and their fair shade
just so you guys get a visual there it's
33 shade ranges that is what I'm talking
about I feel like it's amazing that they
have this whole row for fair skin medium
tone skin and deep skin all different
undertones in here and it's just
incredible to look at all of this how do
you get rid of these cute bottles
they're so cute so it has 16 hour fade
resisting wear which is definitely
proven true through my experience
feel like every time I've worn it it has
Austin all day I've been wearing it for
any photoshoots I've had long days just
everything I love this and it has a
really really great coverage while still
having like a natural finish you know
what I mean another thing it has which I
didn't know and it says here it says it
has a skin optimizing complex which
improves your skin hour-by-hour and it
has a natural blend of raspberry apple
and watermelon extracts to smooth and
improve skin texture for optimal
radiance okay depending on how much Sun
I've gotten I usually go in between
Barcelona and Syracuse I've been mixing
both of them but I think right now I've
lost any tan that I've had so I'm gonna
go with Barcelona today I'm go ahead and
shake this up officially I use about two
pumps of this to cover my entire face
and then I use a third pump to do my
neck because my neck stays very light
typically when I apply foundation I've
been using a Beauty Blender but I really
like the way this looks with just a
buffing brush this is a Charlotte
Tilbury a Hollywood complexion brush let
me show you guys I have some little
marks that just kind of don't want to go
away right now and I just start here and
start buffing everything in so the way I
like to apply the foundation is I like
to buff a thin layer all around just to
get the even complexion look at that all
of those little marks are gone this is
kind of crazy but like with 100% honesty
it's you guys first of all I never do
sponsored videos if I don't feel good
about them and I don't work with
companies if I don't like the product I
mean obviously there's products from
every company that like you like some
you don't like some but this was
something I not rly began loving even
before they reached out to me and I've
been wearing it just made me really
happy that I'm like I already only love
this product but I always want to be
truthful and honest so when I say that
what I'm about to say know that i 100%
mean it but this is literally like
probably my favorite foundation I've
ever tried ever to do my neck I use more
of a stippling brush and I just kind of
lightly graze it over I'm not gonna go
all the way down because I don't want to
get around my shirt you know I'm just
gonna couldn't give it a little so I
want to do
zoom into the skin what it looks like a
natural skin texture doesn't look too
cakey there you go all up in it all Unni
now we're gonna move on to the eyes and
then I will finish the face after I know
you guys have been asking for a more
natural look I'm gonna do that photo you
guys I think I'm gonna go into this new
color pop palette because this is
something I just got I want to use it
it's a give it to me straight
boom this has a lot of good everyday
colors I'm gonna use this shade which is
called matter of fact just a nice little
matte shade and I'm gonna apply that on
the brow bone I'm just kind of set the
lid space a little bit here I just got
my brows done today by Kelly Baker brow
and I'm just so happy because every time
she does my brows I love filling them in
right after cuz they look so much nicer
and clean so how was your guys's your
been going so far
I feel like January was just like whoa
for me I've been go-go-go
and I have something really exciting
tomorrow which you guys will already
know about by the time you watch this
video so you will know that I did my
photo shoot with key it's crazy how long
things take to do you know and I've been
holding on to these Sony's for a hot
minute Stephen and I just went to Paris
which was so fun vlog coming soon on
that too if it was so beautiful and I
will say you know I did meet one of you
guys on the plane and we had a flight
together and I asked her how she liked
Paris and she said that she liked it but
like you know a little like discouraged
and the first time I went to Paris I
think I felt the same way but then we
went back and I was like oh my god this
is a totally different experience I'm in
love with it you know how people say
it's magical I like didn't see that the
first time and it's totally like your
experiences have so much to do with that
but then I fell in love with it and the
last few times we've gone I'm like this
place is incredible the architecture
just like everything about it so nice
I'm gonna go into down right which is
this shade
right here let's say this is like a ma B
tone I'm gonna take a blending brush and
go into that what I like to do is tilt
my head back I can see the socket of my
eye a lot better and just follow those
contours of the eye
I think today I'm going for a very
pretty look something that's really easy
not a lot of steps not a lot of eye
shadow colors I like this color already
because it does have that dusty pink
Mavi undertone which just looks really
fresh
January's kind of been exciting crazy
just all good things I'm really really
motivated and driven I just feel like so
many exciting things are gonna happen
you have to think that you have to think
that and put it out there and then it
put it out to the universe that good
things are gonna happen and I've been
inspired to just like I just want to do
so many cool videos and I love filming
somebody actually asked me the other day
they said if like this would all go away
say like YouTube went away everything
went away what would you do I said I
would want to start a production company
where I help brands or other people make
like really sick videos with my family
with Steven with my brother and Cindy I
love creating concept for videos I'm so
happy you guys liked my last video it's
so much fun for me like the ideas of
editing and like you know I work with
Steven Steven edits a lot to my brother
edits likes to edit too and just like
kind of all working together to come up
with sick ideas for brands that's what I
would do I've been blending for like a
hot minute I'm just gonna go ahead and
deepen that just a pinch I'm gonna use
BS which is right here I don't think I'm
gonna do a lot of that I just want the
slightest hint kind of just on this
outer part to pop a little over there
and you could totally skip this step you
don't have to add this it's gonna look
pretty without it just depends on how
much you want to add so this is really
pretty really soft now what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take a concealer brush this
is dose of colors concealer brush
and just dip into any concealer this is
what really brings the whole look
together and I kind of know I do this in
every video but it just makes it look so
polished cleaning up the lid space with
the concealer no matter how little of
eyeshadow you put on cleaning it up like
this is gonna make such an impact on
your eye makeup look I like to take a
blending brush buff those edges out
after sure it's nice and clean alright
it's always a decision whether I should
do a mat or a shimmer first I'm gonna
take a blending brush with that BS color
that we used and I'm just gonna lightly
buff out the edge where the concealer
meets and this is super easy you just
wiggle it around not too much product so
that it has a nice little gradient and
it's not super harsh there I like to
almost apply the outer like where you
would apply a wing right so heavier out
here and then taper it onto the lash
line and this is even a little bit much
for an everyday look but it's kind of
like what I do you know like when I wear
makeup on Instagram and on snap and you
guys want this like everyday look so
they said a little much but I know you
guys like a little much as you guys can
see this looks really soft really pretty
I love the way this looks now my
decision is always like do I do a
shimmer or do I do a matte I feel like
for me a matte is a little less showy
but then there's also this color oh you
know what I kind of did a co-operate
look so I'm not gonna use that color
this is my thought process how it goes
down I think we have to do a matte shade
because I feel like that's a little bit
more everyday for me this is a good
palette I've been using this a lot love
it this is the BH Studio Pro palette
ultimate neutrals love it really
affordable I'm gonna go ahead and use
this shade right here this color right
here is such a pretty matte everyday lid
shade they don't have names but it's the
second one from the top gonna go ahead
and pack that on all over the lid and
this is also a Mavi tone that might be a
little bit too close to the crease color
so I'm switching that direction I'm
actually gonna go into this shade right
here here we go I am just really loving
this BH Cosmetics palette then you just
take that all
the lid where you applied the concealer
and again taking my blending brush and
just going along those edges so that
everything stays looking really soft we
don't want like a super super cut crease
look this is pretty much my technique
for my everyday eyeshadow looks and I
just switch off the colors to like
Browns or mobs or peaches so there you
go that is the eyeshadow it looks very
pretty overly feminine I'm gonna go
ahead and use my favorite lashes at the
moment these are these are the makeup by
Samuel lashes they are just my favorites
lately I've been wearing them so much I
have to kind of pick the glue off of
them first I'm just gonna apply a little
bit of mascara I'm using the Maybelline
and Shayla mascara and baddest black
also what you want to do when you are
applying lashes with no liner very
important you need to tight line your
upper waterline so right up in there you
got to put a little black liner that way
you don't have any gaps lately I don't
know what it is but I'm gonna tell you
guys this I have been struggling to put
on my lashes I don't know why it's been
a struggle for me and I'm just letting
you guys know that if it happens to you
it's it happens it's normal all right
here goes guys oh I forgot to tightline
my lash line I gave you guys the whole
speech about tight lining and then I I
forgot to do so alright guys I did it
before I do the lower lash line I'm
gonna finish off the face makeup and I'm
gonna pair the foundation with the
natural radiant creamy concealer by NARS
as well this is in the shade ginger
which is what I like I find it
neutralizes darkness this is gonna be
perfect match with the foundation I'm
also gonna take that into this little
smile line here slim it out in this area
taking my Beauty Blender and I'm just
gonna go ahead and blend that all out
you can also use this time to clean up
the outer corner of the shadow I think I
did a little too much there so I'm just
gonna take a blending brush and lightly
diffuse that cuz I don't want it to be
like a straight line just want to be
soft next we're gonna go ahead and set
the under-eye I'm gonna use the
Maybelline fit me and light/medium today
I'm taking a little bit of that on this
elsi brush and I'm gonna apply it on the
cheeks on the sides
and dust it on the under a also I'm
gonna use a little bit of that on the
forehead right here I will put like
whatever's left over just where I'm
gonna apply the bronzer here but not a
lot so now that the under-eye is set we
can go ahead and finish that eye makeup
and this is super easy I keep it simple
I'm just gonna take that really pretty
color that we used in the crease the
very first color which was down right
and I'm gonna take that on my lc4 brush
I'm gonna graze that connecting the
outer corner and just bringing it in I
feel weird having like a bare lower
lashline I usually never do a bare lower
lashline unless I'm not wearing makeup
like eyeshadow at all I just feel like I
like to make my eyes look a little bit
bigger and so I like to apply that
shadow right there I'm not gonna do
darker colors at the bottom because I
still want it to look very like light
and airy and fresh I don't want it to
look heavy at all so we're just using
that same one color to open up the eyes
even more I like to use a lighter pencil
in the waterline this is actually a brow
highlight by Kelly breaker brow which I
always use in my waterline after I apply
this I go back into the brush that I
used for the lower lash line and I just
make sure that there's no liner on my
lashes or like in the shadow area so see
how that opened up my eyes and made them
look a little bigger as well and then
we're just gonna apply it mascara on the
lower lashes I'm doing that off-camera
because I need to like look really
really closely into the camera so I'll
be right back next I'm gonna do the
highlight I'm gonna be using the
Maybelline master chrome highlight today
this is one of my favorite drugstore
highlights I like to tilt my hood and
look to see where the light hits right
here mmm and this is like an everyday
look so I like to keep the highlight
just right here just where the Sun would
naturally hit them bring it up make sure
you blend it really well into the skin
like the edges after you apply most of
the product just kind of feather out
those edges then just a little right up
here of course I love to put highlight
right here just at the very top of the
nose and then I use my finger to apply
it here I know I went a little ham on
the
last video chin highlight so I'll go a
little less okay whatever is leftover on
my brush so not fully like I just ate
KFC but you know what's there actually
I'm gonna go ahead and also use the same
highlight and apply that to the inner
corners this is an LC brush an LC e5
Stevens favorite part of my makeup look
go on with some bronzer I'm gonna use
the Guerlain bronzer in terracotta
alright and I don't want too much
bronzer just a light amount so I'm gonna
dip my brush in and then this is the LCF
10 and then I'm going to dust it on the
back of my hand and just hug the
highlight here kind of helps to put the
highlight on first so that you know that
your highlight and bronzer are meeting
times I'll do like when I'm doing makeup
quick I'll do my bronzer and then I'll
put my highlight on and my highlights
going on this direction my bronzers
going in this direction so there's like
this section here that the two don't
meet when I do the highlight first it
like really ensures that those two are a
couple I'm gonna take a little bit of
that bronzer on a blending brush and
just use it on the very tip of the nose
I usually don't do like a full nose
contour I just do that part so I know I
say everyday makeup when I'm doing this
but I know this can be a lot for some
people so if this is a lot for you
everyday which it is a lot but when I
say everyday I mean everyday when I'm
like I want to be glam today we're gonna
go in with the blush now I love love
this and I've said it before in another
video Becca and Chrissy Teigan little
palette I just love this shade right
here it's so pretty as a blush or a
blush topper and I'm just gonna take a
little bit of the blush and a little bit
of this highlighting blush because it's
very very rosy so I take those two mix
them together I like to put them on the
apples of my cheeks I know not a lot of
people like that some people like to put
it more back here which you could also
do but I feel like this gives you like a
really fresh look and you got to do this
face you have to you have to for the
lips I'm going to use the Charlotte
Tilbury
Penelope pink color this is a really
good everyday lipstick alright this is
the finished makeup look it's really
soft it's perfect for everyday if you
are a makeup wearer like me even if you
decide that this eye look is a little
bit too much for you I feel like this
skin look is
Oh perfect for everyday for anybody just
because it's natural finish it doesn't
look cakey so nice light bronzer melts
perfectly into the highlight just
keeping it mostly to this area right
here it just looks so soft the technique
I did with the blush using an
illuminating blush mixed with a little
bit of a matte blush together on the
apples of the cheeks gives you a really
youthful fresh look and then this lip
pairs perfectly with everything it's
understated and it's hydrating and it's
not gonna like be uncomfortable all day
so I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
let me know what you thought about it in
the comments down below also I'm curious
to know how many of you on a everyday
and when I say everything I mean like on
the days where you decide like I'm gonna
wear makeup how many of you guys wear
lashes like a strip lash I'm very
curious to know leave it down in the
comments below thank you guys so much
