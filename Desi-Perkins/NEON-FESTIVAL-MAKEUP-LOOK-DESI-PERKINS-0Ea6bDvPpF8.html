been a hot minute since I've done a
makeup tutorial I promised myself that I
would use more color this year this is
my first colorful look of 2016 very
proud of myself this I makeup look was
actually inspired by an artist on
Instagram that I found Alyssa Marie
artistry so I saw this look and I was
like des so different than anything I
would do I will link her Instagram down
below in the description box if you guys
want to go check her out I'm also going
to include items that I got in my Ipsy
glam bag this one
also used the new Amman EMU a makeup
geek collaboration palette with this
look you guys are interested in this
makeup look people watch it alright
first we got to prep the skin so I'm
going to use this lightweight hydrating
cream this is by Sarafine botanicals and
it's the Karen rose hydrating cream next
I'm going to prime my skin using the
Smashbox photo finish primer oil and
this is the first oil primer that I have
ever tried and I think it's the first of
its kind moving on a foundation I'll be
using the Make Up For Ever HD stick and
I'm only going to apply this on the
cheekbone and under-eye area as a
highlight this is a lighter shade than
my skin tone it's 127 I've been using
this in that area because it makes it
look more hydrated but if I use it all
over my face I just look kind of oily so
I just use it there that's been working
really well for me alright next I'm
going to go in with my foundation I've
kind of been mixing foundations lately
so today I'm going to be mixing the new
Tarte rainforest of the sea foundation
and the Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless foundation this is a super tan
shade and because my face is pale I just
mix a couple of drops of this to make
this match my skin tone better you guys
can just use whatever you have you don't
have to be like crazy mixing 20
foundations like I am with my Beauty
Blender hello my gosh modern SOS what's
happening with my video in your love it
is so I mix those two foundations
together and just apply it earlier
so it looks super tan at first but
that's just because my face is so pale
but once I blended and it matches the
rest of my body I'm going to be going in
with the bye-bye under-eye this is one
of my favorite concealers to kind of
conceal any basically anything this
concealer is amazing it's by it
cosmetics and I'm using the shape tan
where you have more of a hollow I feel
like this really does a good job at
concealing that I'm going to be using
the lux e 182 brush and this is one of
the brushes from the JD lady 180
collection I've been loving this to
apply it this concealer is pretty thick
so I just take like the lightest amount
and apply it kind of like that in the
hollow areas and then I blend it blend
it away I'm not going to apply any
eyeshadow base today just because really
it because I can't find it at the moment
that's like no big deal but if you're
wearing this for a long night you should
definitely apply one I'm going to go
into this new beautiful palette this is
the mani mu a collaboration with makeup
geek palette and I'm going to be taking
the shade which is Sora Shawna and I'm
using the luxe e23 one small tapered
blending brush and this is going to just
help me blend this color into the upper
crease area this makeup look is going to
be super EXTREME today guys it's not
going to be everyone's cup of tea but I
want to just try to do something outside
of my comfort zone because you know I
tend to stay in the neutrals and I just
want to make sure that I'm catering to
all my color lovers out there this is a
really nice transition shade so I'm kind
of taking it pretty high up just because
we're going to be diffusing eyeshadows
all over the place
should have highlighted the brow bone
before I put that color down but I
forgot so I'm just going to go into this
bone color this is from the two-faced
peanut butter palette super cute this is
the PB&amp;amp;J color but any like bone light
colored eyeshadow will work I'm just
going to highlight with that I like the
brow bone it just overall makes the
eyeshadow look a lot cleaner next I'm
going to pick up these two shades and
just mix them together goes my phone and
apply them in the outer crease just to
deepen it up I know it looks like every
other makeup tutorial right now but it's
going to take a turn in a second you'll
see I mean I already saw in the intro so
you already know I'm using a Smith 230
brush this is one of my favorite
blending brushes but apply most of the
product on the outer corner and then
whatever is left over just kind of a
blend it into the inner corner I'm going
to go back with the Luxy brush and blend
out those edges blend yo edges
okay boys next we're going to take the
colour-pop gel liner this is in the
shade
maybe it's green right here I'm going to
use this as a light base because we're
about to put neon green on our lids oh
man I'm getting crazy today guys like
who is this person using this colored
eyeshadow new year new so next I'm going
to be using the radioactive stack by
milk cosmetics
it doesn't scream desi I got it I got to
do new things I got to make moves I'm
going to be using this green color oh
 this is called or no zine on the
screen pack this on carefully
so next time pick it up nyan from the
milk cosmetic stock and I'm going to
pack that in the inner corner of my eye
as a highlight using the 237 detailed
shader brush by zueva
concentrating most of it on the inner
corner and then blending it up into the
green and then the edges around the tear
duct thing with neon colors is they do
have some fallout next I'm going to be
picking up radioactive which is this
neon pink shade with a Zhu Ava two to
four brush start building this lower
lash line up out in this outer corner
area I like to use this brush because
it's super soft and gentle for the under
eye it doesn't distribute like a
crapload of products so it's good to
build like a smoky effect around the eye
and I'm just going to connect this to
the outer corner over here before I
continue the under eye area I forgot to
apply more concealer just because I had
so much fallout so I'm just going to
carefully go in and apply my NARS creamy
concealer and ginger I'm just going to
kind of put it right here in this
triangle area once again it's like the
search for the Beauty Blender where does
this Beauty Blender keep going it's
literally just wants to ruin my life
this beautiful blend that all in being
really careful not to mess up what we
did on the lower lash line here set that
all with the Laura Mercier translucent
powder and just lightly dip my Beauty
Blender inside of this I like to take
most of the powder and apply it here
first and then work my way up that way
once I get to the under-eye area I'm not
applying too much powder and it doesn't
look too cakey go into the orange this
color right here
so I'm going to pack the orange color a
little bit more in this inner part of my
eye
going into the yellow cream color by
Anasazi Beverly Hills
who's going to apply that to the
waterline apply mascara this is the
hardest tarte mascara it's their new one
the packaging is everything then I'm
going to apply look at my hand right now
this is crazy
you're gonna makeup remover away I mean
it is what it is Steven I don't know
okay so I'm going to apply the Queen B
lashes by Koko lashes and I'll be right
back
this is the eye look complete we're just
going to go ahead and finish off the
rest of the face I'm using Mac give me
Sun of course and my mac 135 brush
everyone always asks me one three five
one three five it's my favorite to
bronze the whole face is just perfect
it's super fluffy it gives you like a
nice all over bronze instead of just
like a denser brush would give you more
like a pinpoint bronze like to apply
that on the hollows of the face and the
perimeter of the hairline whatever is
left over on the brush after you've
applied I just kind of lightly go over
the rest of the face and blend it all
together
all right now it's time for the
highlighter it's my favorite part
of course I'll be using the new Tarte
highlighter this is the skin twinkle
trio this one is by far my favorite
which is the far left in the palette but
I do like to mix these two don't really
care for the center color I just like
the outside colors give it to me put
some of that on the tip of my nose all
right now it's time for blush I'll be
using the bellapierre cosmetics mineral
blush this is in the shade desert rose
just a really pigmented it rosy blush I
like to give a little smile pop it on
the cheeks alright so for my lip liner I
will be using the TARDIS lip liner in
the shade totes
look how crooked my cute Cupid bows are
whoa so for the lip color I'll be using
a dose of colors liquid lipstick and
pinky promise
now color in this video is SE hubby for
dessert and over top of that I have the
perfect formula pink gel topcoat and
this is just going to protect your
polish to make sure it lasts a little
bit longer alright guys so that is it
