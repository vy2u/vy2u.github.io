let's go ahead and get started then
never have I ever gotten into a
fistfight details you want details that
wasn't a part of it yeah there could be
some details you know I was a savage
since second grade okay I lost that
fight I got in like a fist fight with my
best friend at the time and then she
pushed me down the monkey bars I ended
up getting stitches in my head so you
know second oh great I don't II hold I
am wait you you have never got a
fistfight no I'm a good girl good girl
never have I ever taste dated dog food
no never have I ever drunk dialed an ex
for sure who hasn't mm-hmm looks like an
automatic guess yeah never have I ever
picked my nose and wipe my booger on
someone I'm pretty sure I have done that
it's probably cuz you know I've done it
before I'm not ashamed oh never have I
ever made eye contact with someone
through the crack of a bathroom stall
it's really okay I think I have with
Katie before actually I'm gonna send
bring to that one
she pervs on me sometimes she'll be like
never have I ever tried to go to the
bathroom and didn't make it on time
I would lie but my money's here and I
think the truth so I feel never have I
ever shoplifted oh come on
I'm so sorry bath and Bodyworks out as
well and I didn't know better okay I
really wanted like a lip gloss and I
stole it from Bath and Body Works you've
never shopped lifted anything nothing
no not even gum at the grocery store no
I feel like you can put me more to say
it was funny because she's like an angel
and she's making me look bad
no this one time I was gonna take a pin
off of a jacket when I was with my
sister we weren't shopping and she saw
me is she like slapped my hand she was
like don't you do that but mom's
gonna burn your hands I was like okay no
okay never have I ever
clogged a public toilet and walked away
honestly I just feel like these
questions were said I'm gonna make that
to make me look bad
what are you supposed to do is stay
there and float up or something
like what would you do call the plumber
like see this bathroom at the restaurant
one time I clogged the toilet it was
like one of my friend's house when I was
like how do I get the plunger and like I
had to tell her that things were going
south for me if we were doing this with
vodka
I'd be so lit right now it was why not
this is why we're doing it with hot
chocolate never have I ever woken up
angry at someone for something they did
in my dream all the time marki altar I
woke up and literally punched someone
what Stephen once because I was so mad
cause he cheated I mean I dream stir and
I was like never have I ever been thrown
up on who did that who wrote that one is
that you you guys I didn't tell you
about this but Stephen s on this last
birthday on the way home in the new BIR
threw up all over me it was traumatizing
okay he's the worst at throwing up he
doesn't know the rules he doesn't know
how to
it's terrible he'll do it like in the
worst possible way we're driving home in
the uber I could see it in his eyes and
I was like excuse me sir can you please
pull over P please pull over and
Stephens like no I'm fine I'm not gonna
throw up but I knew better and the guys
like taking his time pulling over
because Stephens saying he doesn't
throw up and I'm like pull over now he's
gonna throw up next thing you know
Stephen looks at me and like he can't
even stick his head out the window or
like not towards me it's almost like you
just like that so everywhere
it was all over my chunk glass like
everything and and then I opened the
door and I got out of the car and
Stephen just like fell out face-first
the uber driver was so nice to me I
thought he was gonna be so upset cuz
like I felt so bad that there was
throw-up in his car terrible and he let
me sit up front with him even though was
covered in throw up cuz he didn't want
me to sit next to Stephen with all the
throw-up in the backseat let's just say
that that was the one time I ordered the
uber on my account probably took my
rating down and I had a pretty hefty
fine after that
so thanks Stephen never have I ever
passed out silent fart and it came out
loud and said nope like in public or
like in private

got to let you know but I'll do it in a
nice way like oh you know I have this
really cute hop that would look so good

most judgmental so this could be worse

embarrassing stories Marilla when
Stephen and I first moved into our
little place like own place together we
called it the web etho cuz it was just
so tiny and it was like basically a
garage there was a roach problem like a
massive roach problem when we first
moved in I I remember like getting up in
the middle of the night and turning the
lights on and the floor was like moving
there was that many cockroaches
everywhere on the floor I was like
that's it I can't stay here I remember
that night we ended up sleeping at
Stephens mom oh no that night I didn't
sleep at Stephens mom's house we just
like stayed there and because it was
confined to like the kitchen I thought
so I thought then like the next night I
woke up and there was a roach crawling
on me you guys it's crawling on me and
the minute I saw that it was in my bed I
was like that's it I can't I can't stay
here I can't live here we have to go we
we like sprayed the yard we sprayed the
house but because my neighbors were so
nasty the roaches kept coming back like
they wouldn't stop even though we
sprayed our house it was like the
surrounding houses had problem this is
where it gets embarrassing like I feel
really guilty I feel really bad about
this
you know the roaches they like to crawl
into your and like hide so I get to
this class it was like my anatomy class
and my teacher was really really strict
and like we had a test that morning so I
opened my binder and boom there's a fat
ass Roach sitting on my binder and I my
reaction was like to instantly like food
believe it cuz I freaked out like I just
got so scared flung into the hoodie of
the girl in front of me and mm-hmm this
is where like I sinned cuz I should have
said like oh my god but I couldn't
because I was so embarrassed I was
berest have roaches to begin with and so
the whole test I couldn't focus because
I kept thinking oh my god any minute now
this girl is gonna start screaming it's
gonna be like a roach crawling into her
or something
nothing happened so I was like okay
maybe maybe didn't fly like in her
hoodie maybe it's fine
and then I like three like a row over
this girl starts screaming cuz the roach
made its way to her and it was like
crawling around and she started
screaming in the classroom and freaking
out and she was like oh my god I hope I
don't have roaches at home oh my god and
