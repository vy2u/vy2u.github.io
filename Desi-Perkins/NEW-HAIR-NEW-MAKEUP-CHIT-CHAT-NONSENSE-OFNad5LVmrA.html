uh yeah you don't follow me on snapchat
or Instagram I'm a brunette no we'll get
into that in the video basically what
this video is going to be about is just
random things products that I've
received that I've been testing out
there's a lot of new foundations and I
figured oh my god I'm trying all these
new foundations which is rare for me I
usually stay in my comfort zone but I've
been trying a lot of new products lately
and I thought I would give you guys my
honest opinion on everything that I've
been trying just in case it's something
you've been interested in I'm also just
going to be chit-chatting about life and
all the stuff going on because I don't
feel like I get to talk to you guys
enough here on my youtube channel I talk
to you guys all the time on snapchat and
if you're interested you can definitely
follow me there but here on YouTube I
also don't want to neglect my YouTube
subscribers who don't have snapchat so
this video is just gonna be like chit
chat II just hanging out you're
interested in this type of video then
there's so many hand motions going on
right now keep watching first off I'm
gonna talk to you guys about me Kibeho
so uh I've been blonde for a long time
and growing up I've always dyed my hair
from blonde to dark blonde to dark
blonde to dark probably not gonna have
any hair in my future I was never scared
to diet very adventurous I've been red
have been brown I've been black I've
been blonde I've been too blonde for my
own good and too orange for my own good
I've really done a lot with my hair I've
never been scared to experiment but for
some reason when I went to go dye my
hair this time around I was so nervous
and I have no honestly I was like why am
I so nervous
it's it's nothing it's just hair it
literally just happened within the week
so one week I was like should I just dye
my hair dark initially I was gonna cut
my hair short and then I realized like
my hair is too flat for that like I just
can't have short hair it will be like it
won't be voluminous Bob it'll be like
unless I tease the crap out of everyday
I went to bo he almost had a heart
attack beause my hairdresser he
literally gasped because I always joked
with him like you're gonna dye my hair
dark and he's always taking it very
seriously
it's been a mission to get to the blonde
that I was at and he was really proud of
it as was I I mean I've just been loving
the blonde with as he was about to put
the dye in my hair he's like you can
still turn back he started at a level
six and then my hair was so blonde
underneath the blonde was still showing
I wanted it just a little bit deeper
because once you've been blown for so
long and you rinse your hair out it just
gets like blonde again like it's really
light so we went to a level five if you
guys are interested in the hair color I
don't know anything else past that we
started out of six we went to a five
fives a little bit darker than a six
that's pretty much all I know so that's
the story about my hair this is really
close to my natural hair color and I'm
really happy to be back to a more
natural look for me even though I love
the blonde - I can't even tell you what
I like better I don't need you to tell
me what you like better either
especially if it's blonde I still just
feel not myself I think it's gonna take
me like a week to start feeling like
this is okay this is the normal I've
been struggling with my eyebrows a
little bit because you know they have to
be a lot darker now before they were
light now I have to make them darker oh
and I also got new extensions these are
the Bellamy dark brown which happened to
match perfect I didn't even go into
Bellamy like I just ordered them and
figured they're going to match and they
match perfectly so dark brown now let's
move on to other things other than hair
a lot of people are saying I look more
Asian Oh which I always thought I looked
Asian but now you said that this is how
I met you with this dark hair you were
always into Asians did you think I was
Asian
you did huh I could pass I think Steven
that's what happened there he didn't
know he was getting involved with a
Latina all right so what are we going to
talk about next I have in my drawer here
just items that I've been using
regularly and trying out so that I could
give you guys like kind of a review the
first product I have is the honest
Beauty magic bomb
um if you guys don't know about the
honest brand Jessica Alba runs it she is
so beautiful and sweet and just gives
off the best energy I got to meet her I
almost died
I was shaking so there was that but
anyways I got the beauty balm and this
really stuck out to me because she said
that it helps with creasing under the
eyes after you apply concealer listen
I'm going to be honest with you guys and
tell you that lately I've been creasing
a lot more than I used to crease when
you start seeing things in your body and
stuff change and like your under eyes
you start to get really concerned but so
that's why I was really drawn to this
product
I saw her do a video on it basically
what you do is you apply your concealer
and then in the fine lines you dab some
of this balm in those areas where your
concealer naturally creases and instead
of it getting all dry and Creasy this is
supposed to make it have just a really
nice smooth look not so gathered in
those fine lines I've been using this
and it actually does really help with
the look of the dry under eye you only
apply a very small amount you could also
use this for other things like lip balm
and stuff but I keep it just for my eyes
because you know I don't like to put it
on my lips on my eyes and all that stuff
so I just use it for the under eye area
this is really good for natural makeup
days when I'm out running errands and I
don't even set my concealer I just like
pop on a little bit of it real quick put
this in the fine lines and I feel like
it makes my concealer to look fresher
for longer yes girl
with all right so here we're going to
talk about next
we got the NARS Velvet Matte skin tints
hold please I have a paper here that
says when they come out these were sent
to me FYI
and also fYI even if somebody sends me
something I'm going to tell you guys the
honest truth I hope that that's obvious
um but if I like rave about something
and I don't believe in it like I would
never do that so I'm trying to find this
paper right now it's in my desk
somewhere hello
it stuck in the crevice right here here
we go I ripped it so um I'll just tell
you what this uh info sheet says about
the NARS foundation holy
let me get my life together okay so this
is a Velvet Matte skin tint with SPF 30
it says that it delivers a soft matte
perfection and protection um as a
natural looking finish shine control so
that's good if your oily shine control
let's see what else
supposed to give you like a soft focus
effect maybe like a blurring effect has
vitamins it's supposed to be comfortable
lots of shades yadda yadda yadda okay so
let me give you guys my first
impressions and I know some of you guys
may already know this because you follow
me on snapchat but when I wore this i
legit thought it was a full on
foundation but when it says skin tint to
me that means something more more light
usually skin tints or BB creams and
tinted moisturizers don't really have
enough coverage for my preference unless
I'm on vacation
on the beach you know like but I don't
really gravitate towards that and I
probably would have looked at this and
been like oh man skin tint I don't
really want that but let me tell you
this has really really great coverage I
wore it all day and I didn't even notice
it wasn't a foundation until the next
day when I when I really read this
packaging these foundations are skin
tints as they call them have very full
coverage medium to full I don't want to
say that it's buildable that's the only
thing I will say so I applied this and I
applied it with a Beauty Blender
and I think I tried to build it a little
bit in certain areas and I did find that
because it's so Matt and I built it like
too much it did kind of get like those
lines kind of accentuated around the
mouth area obviously what I applied it I
thought it was a foundation so I went in
like girl like crazy so then I wore it
again and I did a light layer and it
looked really really nice even Katy was
telling me like your skin just looks so
good and I said girls
nars I'm curious to know how would work
on dry skin I wish I could tell you guys
whether I recommend it for dry skin or
not I don't know I feel like I don't
recommend Matt for anybody with dry skin
that's just how I my mentality of
products so I think if you have really
oily areas on your face this is going to
be really nice because it does control
the oil
I get really oily around the nose area
no brows just shiny ass nose by the end
of the day I'm not going to say this
completely blocked it out but it
definitely helped I'm in the shade
medium one I also have medium to here
which is a little bit too dark for me
the next product I have here is the
Becca aqua luminous perfecting
foundation and this is completely
opposite of the NARS one that we just
talked about I have the shaped tan here
but I'm going to say the Shaytan is too
dark for me so I'm going to go the shade
lighter than tan whatever shade that is
that's where I need to be I've been
using tan low and really tanning up my
skin and my face I feel like I can make
myself more tan now especially with the
dark hair let me tell you guys a little
bit about this when I first tested this
on my hand I honestly didn't really like
it I thought oh this is kind of like Mac
face and body and if you like Mac face
and body then you'll love this but it's
because it's like better than that I
tried it on my hand wasn't a fan but
just so you guys know when you test when
you swatch a foundation on your hand it
has a totally different effect on your
hand than it does on your face so I
decided to give it a try on my skin and
I'm just going to let you guys know
right now that if the next vacation I go
on this is going to be my go-to
foundation because it's so pretty and
lightweight and glowy and dewy and I
mean I didn't get super greasy I did
look really really dewy and I just had
to powder my nose with this foundation
but like my skin looked radiant with
this it's so pretty it's nothing it's
it's like if you love Mac face and body
this is that a million times better in
my opinion it has a little bit more
coverage I know you can build Mac face
and body but this one just has the right
coverage right away and i've also been
mixing this in other foundations because
it has like a drop
right so I've been dropping it into
other foundations if I want just to add
a little bit more a luminous effect to
maybe a normal foundation this gives a
really luminous glow so I've been adding
a few drops of it here and there you
don't really need a lot this is a good
foundation for me just when I want to
look more natural everyday type of look
that's how I feel about it so I really
really like this foundation a lot so the
next thing we have he'll is another
thing that I'm pretty sure
nikkietutorials is making everybody buy
at this moment in time she makes this
look so good if you guys don't subscribe
to nikkietutorials you need to because
she is amazing and I feel like
everyone's really talking about her
right now because she's just killing it
killing it Nikki you're killing it so
proud of her anyways these are the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation stocks
so I got two colors
mainly because nikkietutorials uses two
colors and I want to do exactly what she
did because she made it look right so I
got one to highlight the high points of
my face which is 125 and then I have I
mean 127 sorry and then I have 153 which
is more close to my natural skin tone
and I use this on the contour areas of
my face so I feel about these oh I'm not
sure I don't think they're bad yet I'm
trying to figure out if they work for my
particular skin type I don't know it's
so weird I've never felt so stumped I
guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm
neither here nor there I've been using
this foundation um picking it up and
trying it because I want to really get a
feel for it but I would say that if
maybe these like disappeared I wouldn't
be like oh no I don't have my makeup
forever HD foundation sticks what am I
going to do I'm perplexed I've never
felt so like just I don't know what to
tell you guys hello so these foundation
sticks if you apply them straight to the
face give you a more full coverage
foundation like they'll cover everything
that's that's a fact
they are really really nice full
coverage foundations or
if you use this like with a light hand
or with a stippling brush and just
stipple it on it gives you a more
natural foundation so I think all in all
what my opinion is on these foundations
is that I really like it lightweight but
if I apply too much I get too oily and I
feel like it starts to move around a
little bit on me like in these areas
like slippery you know a little slippery
so it is a cream so creams do tend to do
that I'm just curious to know how they
work on other skin types so if you guys
have tried this and you have another
skin type other than combination I would
really like to know your opinions on it
so yeah bottom line if I apply this very
lightly I really like the natural no
makeup look but even coverage that it
gives me if I apply it too heavy it's a
little too slippery for me at the end of
the day so next shoe next we have the
Make Up For Ever HD invisible cover
concealer I have mixed emotions on this
but I really really love it
so let me explain what I mean I use this
on my under eyes and it didn't really
work for me in that area and I'm not
sure if it's because my personal issue
with my under eyes at this moment in
time if the weather so dry that my eyes
are just looking like really Creasy but
it just it really creased on my under
eyes so I didn't really care for it on
my under eyes but I used it on my
blemishes and discoloration and let me
tell you guys this is such a good
concealer to conceal anything on your
face the formula is so beautiful it like
blends into the skin it's almost like
you can just quickly just dab it on any
areas that you need coverage and it
covers really well and then it just
melts into the rest of your face I love
wearing no makeup and then just covering
things here and there with this and it
looks so natural you can't even tell
that I'm wearing anything but it's just
perfect it looks so good I love the
formula I want to hope that later it'll
look better on my under eyes but right
now because they're so dry it just
didn't really work for me so
kind of a it's kind of a weird opinion
I'm curious to see what anyone else
thinks of this on the under eyes if
you've tried it I would love if you guys
let me know in the comments below
because maybe it's just me at this time
but I will say that for covering
anything else on your skin so good if I
go to the gym sometimes maybe I just
want to dab a little concealer here and
there perfect I'm in the shade y41 next
thing we're going to talk about are the
anasazi Beverly Hill brow definers these
are the new eyebrow pencils that they
just recently came out with they have a
tip that creates several different
textures and lines thin lines thick
lines you know different shapes and I'm
in the shade this is like new for me
because you know my hair is dark I'm I'm
going with ebony right now which is
pretty it's like a pretty dark color
obviously you can see it better on my
actual brows but it's pretty dark I will
say that when I first used this pencil I
absolutely loved it and I still really
liked it it's not that I don't like it
but as you use it obviously the shape
changes the shape that's supposed to
give you all these different lines like
the sharpness of it when I first got it
it was really sharp so I could create
perfect hair like strokes but then it
like dulled down and now I can't get
those hair like strokes as much because
it's it's a little bit more round and
not an angular anymore it's just like a
lipstick the more you wear it and the
way where it changes the shape of it so
I wish there was a way to like bring it
back to its former state because in that
state it's so amazing like I could
literally make it look like I have
full-on brow hairs with this but you
know I still really like the product I
really think the pencil looks nice I've
still been using it so all in all I
really like yeah the next thing we have
here should is the matte lipsticks so
these are the new liquid lipsticks that
Mac has come out with I feel like they
came out with these a little
you late because now everybody has
liquid lipsticks and there are a lot
more brands out there that a lot more
affordable that's just my opinion I
decided to buy these because obviously I
had to first of all I got three Reds
different shades of red more of like an
orange red a true red I don't even know
why I got this other red there's just so
many Reds that's more of like a spicy
red I'm just dropping everything um so I
got the color feels so grand and feel so
grand is like a true red like a Marilyn
Monroe just red and then I got fashioned
legacy which to me is lighter than the
feel so ground red it's a little bit
less deep and then I have quiet the
stand out which is I think one of my
favorites because it's like an orange II
fiery red and I love the more orange red
tones and then I got this dark color
because I had to get the stark color and
this is the high drama I got to nudes
this one is more of an ma vie nude and
this is back in vogue back in a vogue a
little more ma vie and this one is
Mademoiselle it's like a peachy peachy
nude like to be honest with you I'm like
super underwhelmed with these lipsticks
I wore one one of the red ones and I
felt sticky all day like it never really
fully set like almost if I touched it I
didn't feel like the normal liquid
lipstick where I just feel like I could
basically do anything and it wouldn't
end up on my chin
these ended up on my chin like the
bottom lip lipstick ended up on my chin
it's just a little bit more creamy than
I would like I could feel the liquid
lipstick on my lips which I don't like
and I know that's hard to come by ones
that don't make you feel like you're
wearing it but it was just it wasn't
even like a tight dry feeling it was
like a crumbly creamy feeling that makes
any sense like I just I wasn't really
that much of a fan I much prefer the
next liquid lipstick that I'm going to
talk to you guys about which is a lot
more for some reason I'm not sure where
I placed all the other
ones that I have of these but these are
the violent Voss liquid lipsticks violet
Voss is a company who started off making
glitters for the eyes and then they made
eyelashes and now they're making these
liquid lipsticks if you guys watched
Katie and I did a collab on her channel
where we talked about these I had no
idea what they were like because I
didn't actually try them yet she had
more of a feel Harper about your AAS
over here Harper I absolutely love love
these liquid lipsticks especially the
color excessive which for some reason I
think it's in my purse somewhere I don't
know where it is but I will put a photo
of me wearing it here it's just the
richest most beautiful dark chocolatey
oh it's so nice it looks so good
the finish is amazing the wearability is
so nice it feels super light it's very
comfortable they also have really cool
shade it's like this is a color flirt
which is super cool it's like a Mavi
grey it's just a really unique color
that I have not seen and then I have
this one which is less is more light
Mavi but it has a gray undertone so I
really like the collections that they
have come out with the colors are so
pretty and the price point on these are
$12 there are 12 dollars each so another
thing another random thing I just wanna
talk to you guys about let me know in
the comments below if you're interested
in this eye makeup look it's pretty much
just a winged liner and it has no actual
liner I just use eye shadows and it's
super quick super quick technique also
makes your eyes have a more almond E
shape and it's so fast maybe I could do
Steven was just saying I should do like
a challenge do a cat eye in a certain
amount of time so maybe that would be a
good idea that's not including the
eyelashes okay like that's another beast
let me know if you're interested and if
you're not then just be like no bitch we
don't want to see that I will be doing I
will be doing a how I organize my makeup
video cuz I know you guys have all been
asking I'm still not done organizing I
know
feels like I've been organizing for ever
and that's because I have like to be
honest
Katie's more moved into her place than I
am and she just moved in two days ago
which is like super sad but she's just
like super organized and I am NOT I am a
messy unorganized person so I've been
really working on it and trying to
figure out the best way to store
everything so I'll definitely be doing a
video for you guys just in case you were
wondering I will do a video and I will
try to do it soon all right so I think
it's everything I think I caught you
guys up on my life and products that
I've been trying out stuff like that I
really hope that you guys enjoy this
type of video I just really wanted to
just sit and talk to you guys for a
little bit so give it a thumbs up if you
did like it and I'll see you guys in my
next tutorial bye oh I'm not wearing a
bra do you think anyone would notice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
