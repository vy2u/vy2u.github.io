today's tutorial is going to be on this
New Year's Eve inspired makeup look I
wanted to do something non-traditional
which to me means like older silver
that's typically what I would go for for
New Year's Eve so I decided to go for
paint that's definitely not what I would
usually go for and I loved the way it
turned out it's kind of like a coppery
pink mixture I really hope that you guys
enjoy it and if you're interested and
keep on watching the first thing we're
gonna do is prime our lids I don't have
my nails on right now I took them all
off on the flight back from Utah I saw
an opportunity to lift one of the
corners and once one nail went off they
all just went so I'm using Mac soft
ochre I don't know if I said that yet
next I'm going to take Mac's Blanc type
it's just a bone colored eye shadow what
I'm going to do with this is highlight
the brow bone I'm concentrating most of
the product and doing packing motions
onto the brow bone and then once we pack
as much as we want just on the high part
here
I'm going to drag the rest of it down
onto the crease we're going to do our
foundation last today my nose is really
stuffy it gets so much stuff here like
as the night as it gets later in the
night I think it's like my allergies or
something I'm not too sure next thing
we're going to do is take Peach Smoothie
this is by makeup geek on a 2 to 4 brush
by Mac cosmetics and I'm going to apply
this color in the upper crease area I
stopped using the Mac two-to-four for a
little bit don't even know why I would
ever do such a thing because now that
I'm using it again I'm like why did I
ever stop this brush is just so good for
transition shades in the crease it does
all the work for you it just gives the
perfect seamless blend my lips whoo girl
they're so chapped so next I'm going to
go in with the Melrose shadow by color
pop and a sigma e25 brush I love this
blending brush once I get the shape
lightly mapped out and I'm going to
start building on that color so next I'm
going into the tartlet palette and I'll
be taking activists here it's just a
really deep rich dark brown this is a
Smith 302 brush outline my crease here
just want to do something pretty sharp
I'm just using that brush and really
creating a cut crease with this in
recent times my eyelid shape has really
changed just comes with the territory of
getting older I guess I've noticed that
my crease used to go straight across
like how you see the cut crease here but
now it's almost like it goes up more
here and down more here I'm creating the
illusion of a straight across cut crease
even though that's not really the shape
of my crease when my eye is open it
looks like a perfectly straight cut
crease if I go like this it looks a
little funny but if you don't have a
perfect crease and you want to create a
crease you have to just have your eye
open and see what it looks like and then
I'll go back into the Sigma blending
brush and smooth out those edges and I'm
just kind of winging out the edge there
with whatever product is left over after
we've gone into the crease with the
lightest hand extend that out and taper
it just a small point next I'm going to
pick up on a Stassi Beverly Hills shadow
in henna this is a really nice foiled
eyeshadow that comes off super red I'm
going to go ahead and pack this all over
the lid try using my fingers cool yes
sorry if you have I shadow fall out
because we haven't put on our foundation
anytime you're working with glitters or
loose pigments I usually like to do my
foundation and my concealer last because
fallout can get crazy now I'm going to
be applying some of the litter I'll be
using a little bit of the violet Voss
glitter glue this is the glitter
adhesive and it's clear so it's nice
lightly dab this over the lid I'll be
taking the motives cosmetics glitter
this is in the shade jewel pink and just
going to use my finger since I have that
option these days and I'm going to be
pressing it on top of the eyeshadow
something about the pink over this like
reddish copper color I really like the
combination about taking a makeup
remover wipe I'm just gonna get rid of
all that glitter that fell everywhere
just going to go ahead and start my
foundation this is the hello flawless by
Benefit Cosmetics love this foundation I
used to use it all the time I'm just
going to use a Beauty Blender to start
stippling back on probably going over
some glitter particles on my face but
it's fine I did prime my face using the
Nivea the one the nikkietutorials uses
it's like I'll link it down below it's
actually like a men's aftershave but she
says works great as a primer I bought it
and I've been using it lately and I
absolutely love it so that's what I used
on my face so I'm just gonna keep
stippling this foundation on until I
have an even finish a finish this video
needs a thumbs up just because Stephen
is up behind the camera right now
filming and it is which I'm setting the
standard time is 336 336 it is almost 4
a.m. in the morning
and we're filming a New Year's tutorial
right now I so going in with my
concealer this is the NARS creamy
concealer in ginger and then just blend
it all in
next I'm going to set the concealer
using the Laura Mercier translucent
powder
now to set my face set my face to set my
makeup I'm going to be using the Mac
Studio Fix and NC 40 I'm using Mac give
me son
I've been so caught up in going back
into the colour-pop shadow I'm going to
run that on my lower lashline basically
repeat the steps we did in the crease
on the lower lash line so now I'm just
darkening up the lower lash line with a
dark brown focusing this mostly on the
outer edge of the eye and for an inner
corner highlight on the eye I'm going to
be using cheeky this is by color pub so
I'm really building this color pop
shadow on the inner corner because I
want it to be as opaque as possible but
to finish off the eyes I will just be
applying my Tarte cosmetics lights
camera flashes mascara and the Koko
lashes in goddess which are a dupe for
the House of lashes ikonics they're
similar in style so I'm just going to go
ahead and do that real quick and I'll be
right back so now that we have our
lashes on I'm highlighting using the
Laura Geller gilded honey this is my
favorite highlighter just gonna be
applying that on the tops of the
cheekbones on the Cupid's bow to put the
nose bridge of the nose so I'm going to
go into this Tarte blush here
unfortunately there's no name on the
back of it i depotted these from like a
palette I'll try to figure out which one
it is but it's just a coral shade
for my lip color I'll be using the lip
land shade and Reesie this is Amara's or
aam Rosie's liquid lipstick that she did
in collaboration with lip land this is
the perfect lip color for this eye look
the last thing you want to do is of
course set all the powders on your face
so I'll be using mac fix+
