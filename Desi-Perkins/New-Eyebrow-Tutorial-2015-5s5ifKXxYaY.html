today's video is going to be an updated
brow at Oriel you guys have been
requesting it like crazy it's been about
a year since my last brow tutorial that
i uploaded on my channel i fully stand
by that brow tutorial I think it's still
a really good technique I think it's
actually even better for people who have
sparse areas but have thicker brow hairs
in general so if you're interested in
that I will link it down below this
tutorial is a lot more simplified it's a
lot easier less products and it's a
little bit softer so if you guys wanted
to get a more softer brow then this
video is going to be good for you guys I
will give you guys tips on how to keep
everything fleek ish so if you're
interested in this brow technique then
go ahead and keep on watching so a tip
that I want to mention is that I always
do my eyebrows before my foundation
today I'm actually doing it after
because I'm filming this video for you
guys but I did clean off the eyebrow
area to make sure there was no leftover
foundation Foundation tends to move
around a lot as you sweat as the oils in
your skin start to like develop
throughout the day so it'll actually
make all the products also do those
things and you don't want half of your
eyebrow missing at the end of the day so
do your eyebrows before your foundation
so the first thing I do when grooming my
brows is I take a clear brow gel
this one is Anastacio Beverly Hills and
some people do this after they're done
but I first like to brush the brows in
place with a clear brow gel because I
feel like that's when you can really
hold the brow hairs down without
removing any product if I do this too
roughly after I do the penciling in I
feel like it takes away some of the
product and then I have all these like
patchy areas so I like to do it first it
also really holds down the hairs and it
gives me a cleaner eyebrow shape and I
like to brush these hairs up in this
front area and then I'll kind of smooth
these back like so I'm just going to let
that dry for a second and then I'm going
to show you guys how to pencil them in
so once that eyebrow gel is dry I'm
going to take my honest hace of Beverly
Hills brow ways and soft Brown and I'm
going to first start in this area of the
brow and lightly map out the shape that
I want to create on the lower part of
the brow I like to make it a little bit
thicker here my eyebrows a little bit
too thin
so I'm just gonna run it along the lower
part of the brow and create the initial
shape that we want and like a rule of
thumb when you're doing your brows if
you take your brow pencil and you hold
it next to your nostril it'll tell you
where your eyebrow supposed to start
just vertically like this and then your
art should be right here
and then if you go like this your end of
your brow should be here so that's kind
of what we have going on here so I'm
just going to continue to line the lower
part of my brow and as you guys can see
I'm lightly feathering the product
through the brow I'm not pushing it in
really hard because I do want it to look
like natural hairs I don't want it to
look too blocky and if you guys notice I
didn't just do a line like I kind of
feathered the line out but it gave us a
nice guide of how we want our eyebrow to
turn out then I'm going to go to the
more sparse areas here along the top
very very lightly and thicken up the
brow and create more volume in this area
because I don't have a lot of hair here
same concept just really light strokes
where you don't have any hair like if
you don't have hair like me in this area
I start to put a little bit more
pressure I'm going to continuously go
over just this area with the product so
that the darkness of this area kind of
equals out to the darkness of this area
if you put the same amount of product
throughout your whole brow what's going
to happen is it's going to look lighter
here still because this part will get
darker the more product you place it's
all about product distribution really
and the spoolie on the other hand is
really really handy because if product
starts to build up too much I just kind
of brush through the brows to soften it
up so as you guys can see you know
you're starting to see that this is
looking more like there's actual here
here and it's matching the darkness of
this area where I actually have hairs
all right so after we have filled in the
entire eyebrow I like to go back in with
the eyebrow gel I actually wipe off a
lot of the product because you don't
want too much of it to ruin your artwork
but I like to take this after and run it
up the front of my brows and just
lightly set everything one last time so
the last thing I like to do is take a
tiny bit of concealer onto a small
concealer brush and I like to just run
it under the brow very very lightly this
is a good trick if you want to cover any
hairs that might be coming in between
eyebrow visits helps it look like your
browser still pretty fresh also
highlights the brow bone a little bit
and I kind of keep this mainly only in
this area I'm not going to bring it into
the inner part of the brow because I
want to keep it looking more soft so I'm
just going to lightly feather that down
this is what my brow looks like now that
I've penciled it in and just a reminder
this is what it looked like before so
alright guys so that is it for this
