today's video is pretty exciting because
it is a collaboration video with
kathleenlights here on YouTube if you
guys aren't subscribed to her I will
link her channel down below and
definitely check her out because she's
really funny
she's super cute and her makeups amazing
you guys will love her trust me she's
amazing our video idea was to just play
off of spring right now and we decided
to do a daytime spring look and a
nighttime spring look this is my
nighttime spring look I still wanted to
keep it fresh just like kind of the
daytime look but a little bit smokier
and a little bit more with bronzer and
contour and stuff like that and a bright
lip because dang everyone wants a bright
lip and spring too so I really hope that
you guys enjoy this tutorial and with
all that said let's get started the
first thing you want to do for a spring
nighttime look is of course prime your
face I'm using the makeup forever
step 1 radiant primer because you want
to be radiant I'm just gonna apply this
all over my skin next I'm gonna go in
with a foundation this one is the ex1
foundation it's the invisible iqua
Dacian in the shade f 300 I'm just gonna
buff that into the skin using my zoeva
102 slick finish buffing brush and this
foundation is also pretty lightweight so
you can apply a light layer or you can
really build it up to a more full
coverage if that's what you want is that
hair dye on my sideburn
alright so as our foundation kind of
gets some time to set into the skin I'm
gonna work on my eyes I'm using Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot as my eyeshadow base and
just gonna apply that all over the lid
also if you have any redness and your on
your eyelids this is really gonna cancel
it out too next I'm going to go in with
honest Asti Beverly Hills caramel
eyeshadow and a morphe m4 4-1 brush this
is gonna be our transition shade for the
crease this just gonna warm up the look
and it's gonna make all of our high
shadows a lot easier to blend
this blending brush does all the work
for you
I feel like I just did that crease in
like two seconds a really really great
brush and more a few brushes are super
inexpensive if you guys are looking for
a good blending brush I recommend this
one after we've added that transition
shade I'm gonna go in with anastacio
Beverly Hills red earth this is just
like a really nice warm chocolatey brown
color and I'm gonna use my two three one
Zoe the brush so I'm just gonna pop that
in an outer V shape
and then whatever is left over on the
brush I'm just gonna kind of run that
through the crease okay so now it's time
for the lid color and what I'm going to
do is I'm gonna take the color pop
eyeshadow called kathleenlights and also
a little bit of blaze which is the
bronze shade I'm gonna kind of make a
mixture of these two and apply them to
the lid and you just want to feather it
into the V you made on the outer corner
of your eye - I'm going to use hot
chocolate this is a by Anasazi Beverly
Hills and I'm gonna use this to deepen
out the outer corner and I'm gonna try
to slightly wing it out just a bit I'm
using a Mac 217 brush for this just
slightly wing it upwards to lift the eye
I don't know what I don't know one just
came from him oh good thing I didn't do
my concealer yet so a way to do this is
this like really stick the tip of the
brush into the crease and then see how
I'm kind of pushing it flat and then I
pull up that way most of the product is
being focused here but then the bristles
are kind of blending it outwards so now
you guys can see this eye looks a little
bit more lifted where this I just kind
of goes down and round so you just want
to get that nice like how do I shave
without doing a wing so now that we did
the eye shadow we can really clean up
and do our under eye concealer I'm using
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer in
medium light and it's gonna pop back in
this inner corner here and what I like
to do is take my concealer and kind of
just create even a nicer sharp line on
this outer corner here clean up any
eyeshadow that you know drifted blend
all of that beep oh and to blend all of
that out I'm using a real techniques
sculpting brush and I'm just gonna Pat
that in the concealer does really clean
it up but you don't want it to be this
like sharp line so unless you're doing a
winged liner then you could leave it but
I like to just take a clean blending
brush and just lightly diffuse that
sharp line so it's not like super super
harsh as you still want this to be nice
and smoky soft you want to set that
under-eye concealer so ooh
so I'm using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit and I'm using the shade of
banana which is right over here and I'm
using that on an elf blush brush which I
love for the under eye I'm just gonna
pop that on I'm gonna go ahead and take
the caramel shade that we used in the
crease and a flat shader brush and just
run that on the lower lash line I'm
gonna take hot chocolate again which is
the dark brown we used on the outer
corner and a little angled brush or a
small brush any brush you guys have
that's tiny
I'm gonna define just the outer portion
of the eye again just to kind of draw
attention to the elongated I look so
lastly for the eyeshadow I'm just gonna
apply an inner corner highlight using my
mary-lou manizer highlighter by the balm
and I'm just gonna pop this into the
inner corners it's pretty much my
favorite highlighter in general but I
love putting it here because it's nice
and bright I'm just gonna pop that in
that area and I'm also gonna take a
little bit of that under the brow bone
but not a lot just to kind of dust off
whatever's left over so now it's time to
just add a little bit of mascara and
curl your eyelashes I'm gonna go ahead
and do that real quick I'm applying my
roller lash mascara by benefit which I
absolutely love the eyelash trees I'm
gonna be using are these right here
these are the siren by house of lashes
they're really nice and PC and kind of
light
next I'm going to go ahead and powder my
face because we did apply the foundation
but we never powdered it I want to keep
my face overall really luminous but I'm
gonna just powder the center of the skin
because I do tend to get oily around
this area my forehead and my chin this
is the benefit hello flawless to warm up
the skin I'm using my Mac's give me Sun
bronzer it's a nice warm bronzer just to
give us like that really nice tan look
and to apply that I'm using my Mac 160
brush and then I'm gonna lightly contour
with the Anastasio contour kit and just
gonna take a few of these shades I tend
to mix them together but whatever
contour color works for you is fine I
don't want to do too crazy of a contour
just slightly I always say that and then
I'm like chiseled I'm gonna keep the
contour just on the outer parts of the
cheekbones
and for blush I want to keep it a little
bit rosy since we're gonna do a bold lip
this is pinch-me by Mac I'm just gonna
bring a nice fresh flush of color to
your face
yeah highlight my cheekbones I'm using
mary lou manizer by the balm and a Mac
two to four brush and I'm just gonna
lightly blend that along the cheekbones
next I'm gonna use a little bit of that
just on the very tip of my nose just to
give us the glow all over the face not
just on the cheekbones and then also on
my Cupid's bow lastly it's the lips and
I think for a spring look bright lips
are always a big hit a lot of corals
oranges but I think I'm gonna go for a
really classic red lip I'm gonna line
them first with Mac's cherry lip liner
this is one of my favorite red lip
liners alright so lastly I know I look
funny like this lastly we're gonna apply
lip color this has been my favorite read
lately it's the honest Aussie Beverly
Hills liquid lipstick in bloodline I
love these lipsticks because you could
wear a bright lip without having to
worry about it I know that when I used
to wear bright lips before it was just
the most annoying thing when you ate
you'd always end up with like lipstick
right here these dry completely matte
and they stay put all day so it's really
nice
and this is like a blue base red so it
really makes your teeth look white oh my
teeth look now tell me I don't look like
but look even more dewy for a final
touch I like to spray fix+ just I feel
like when you spray fix+
over your highlight and I've said it
before but it really makes your
highlight stand out more so and that is
the last step of the makeup look alright
