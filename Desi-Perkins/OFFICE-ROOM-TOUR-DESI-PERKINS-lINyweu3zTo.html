know I've been working with a design
company called Laurel and Wolfe to
design an office space
I've had this empty space on this side
of my house for quite some time I think
it's meant to be a formal living and
dining space but we all know I don't do
anything formally so it was empty
well I teamed up with Laurel and Wolfe
it's really cool they do everything
online
you give them your ideas your style
inspiration photo and then from there we
went on and we just kind of fine-tuned
everything work together created the
space which is awesome because I would
have never been able to do this by
myself
this room is pretty long and it has a
nice flow I decided to split the room
into a more formal office space and then
I wanted the other side of the room to
be more of a lounge because I tend to
lay on a couch when I edit I'm always in
sweatpants I like to be really
comfortable and so the lounge is really
nice just to get some movement going and
just so I feel like I'm not suffocated
in just an office I can move around I'm
mobile in this space if I want to sit
here I can sit here if I want to sit on
the couch I can sit on the couch there's
a lot of seating space around there just
saying I can sit so many places and I
don't feel confined and trapped in a
little office space so we're going to go
ahead and start the tour on the more
formal side which is the side with the
desk the desk is one of my favorite
pieces because it is so chic chic EDG
and the glass top just keeps everything
really open and airy in a smaller space
but it still gives you a large surface
area to work on which I love I wanted to
keep it airy with minimal decorations on
the tabletop so I just used a picture
frame as a personal touch some greenery
and of course to really tie in the color
throughout the room a pop of color with
the base
to warm up and in space it's really nice
to have a rug and we chose this one I
think this rug is so beautiful because
it does have the gold reflex which
really pulled together all the accents
in the room including the chandelier
which I am just dying for I knew that I
wanted this chandelier because it's a
statement piece and I knew it was going
to bring the whole room together and
give it a wow factor especially against
a matte black statement wall which I
also knew that I wanted I love black and
gold and whites mixed together so we
really incorporated a lot of that color
scheme throughout the room but we also
added some pops of color with picture
frames and decorations to tie into the
painting that is on the wall and of
course you guys already know I had to
have a safe spot for my eyelashes
because that is key that's key
so moving on to the other side of the
room this is the more lounging side of
the office space and I'm so excited to
have a space like this because there is
so much seating and it's a really great
place to have friends over content
creators over discuss video ideas get
creative and also maybe have a glass of
wine it's just a really social space
that inspires a lot of conversations
which I really really love this room
doesn't carry a lot of lights so I
wanted to keep all the pieces light and
airy with the exception of the coffee
table that is a stronger heavier piece
but it was nice to have all this extra
seating without taking up a lot of room
with the small puffs
those are great I really like those and
to also open up the room we have a large
Leiner mirror which is beautiful because
it just opens the space and makes it
look even bigger then lastly we have
this reading nook area by the fireplace
which I love because this chair is just
so glamorous yet comfortable it's such a
statement piece it ties really well with
the rest of the room with the gold and
of course above the fireplace such a big
proud award from YouTube from you guys
for 1 million subscribers which I
cherish and I love that it's finally
hung up or I can see it it just makes me
smile every single time I walk into this
room it's probably the most valuable
thing to me in this entire space it's
just everything to me so I also have my
100,000 subscriber plaque from both my
YouTube channels my blog channel and my
BD channel and I just love this corner
because of those plaques so that's it
for the office tour I really hope that
you guys enjoyed this video give it a
thumbs up if you did
