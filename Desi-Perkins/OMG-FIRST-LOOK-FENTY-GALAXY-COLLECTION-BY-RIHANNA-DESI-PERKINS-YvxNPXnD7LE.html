today's video is a pretty exciting one
because today I get to show you the
entire Fanta beauty by Rihanna Holiday
Collection boom look at this packaging
it's incredible I'm so excited
fenty reached out and they sent me the
entire collection to show it to you guys
however it is not sponsored but they did
send me the product so I will be showing
you guys swatches of the product just in
case you guys want to check it out
before maybe ordering it online or
anything like that so this is the
packaging and I love it there's a ton of
other products that we're gonna go
through this is just the palette the
galaxy palette which I mean hello
me Tommy so house and I'm pretty honored
and excited that fenty reached out to me
to show you guys first I think that's
super cool and thank you guys so much
for that so with all of that said let's
go ahead and get started with the
tutorial the first thing we're gonna do
is apply some foundation I'm gonna try a
new shade of foundation from the fenty
line since I got a lot lighter my tan
kind of went away so I think we're gonna
try Pro filter foundation in 3:20 today
I already primed my face and my lids so
I'm just gonna put a few pumps on the
back of this little dish it's actually a
candle holder from Michaels but it's
like perfect for foundation first I'm
going to use a brush to put it on the
skin so the beauty blender doesn't soak
it up usually I would do foundation last
especially because this look is gonna be
a little bit more on the smoky side
however the way I'm going to be blending
out my shadows more of a fanned out look
I have to have my foundation on first
and my concealers hopefully it works out
now I gotta just make sure it all blends
down to this area so I'm gonna take that
down my neck as well and I'm using a
Smashbox stippling the foundation brush
now that we did the foundation I'm gonna
go ahead and move on to the eye look I'm
gonna pick up the zoeva
mat spectrum palette and use this shade
right here and this one just kind of
want like a nice light orange shade to
start us off and I'm using a Smith to a
3-2 brush I'm gonna start on the outer V
of the eye and the
start sweeping this in the upper crease
just circular motions here and then
start sweeping it I'm taking this all
the way in to the inner corner here and
I want this super blown out and diffuse
to I'm gonna be taking a little bit of
my Charlotte Tilbury powder and just
setting it right over here because I'm
gonna be taking the eyeshadows out in
this area and I don't want it to skip
over the foundation whatever's left over
on the brush just start to lightly push
it out towards the temple next I'm
picking up a Smith 230 and we're gonna
dip into matte cranberry shade and then
this is like a really really terrified
of orange I'm gonna press this into the
outer V of my eye then we're about to go
into trusty old Sienna the difference
between these two is Sienna has a little
bit more of a brown which is what I need
to deepen the crease section here so I'm
starting on the outer V and then I'm
going to blend it in words here kind of
marry all those shadows together I get
excited for Halloween every year
Halloween is literally my favorite time
of year I mean I like Christmas too it's
like warm and cozy but I just I love
Halloween
I feel like it's the one time of the
year where I really get to just go crazy
with makeup and I know I could do it all
year round but I feel like people don't
ever really want to see it all year
round for me nobody's looking for how to
be like a werewolf in like summer now
I'm gonna go into this forest green
shade right over here and we're gonna
deepen the crease with that so I'm using
a two four seven and I'm starting on the
outer part of the socket crease and I'm
gonna pull that in and I'm holding my
brush downwards opposed to up because I
don't want to blend this color up I just
want to pinpoint it right into the
crease once we get to this outer corner
you lightly feather it whatever is left
on the brush drag it out straight what
are you guys thinking you're gonna dress
up as for Halloween that may sway my
decision of exactly what looks I'm going
be doing I mean I already have an idea
but I'm open to more ideas you guys have
something in mind that you want to be
for Halloween let me know holler at me I
say it's baby and I love hocus-pocus I
swear October first actually before it
even hit October I was watching Hocus
focus one of my faves for sure I'm just
going in with the brush that I used the
orange and red colors and just kind of
diffusing that green I don't know how I
feel about the remake only because it's
so perfect the way it is it's like a
tradition it's a classic and I know
classics have been redone all the time
it's almost like saying like we're gonna
remake clueless mmm I don't think so now
we're going into the dog Donal dawn this
is the new galaxy pilot that Rihanna
came out with with fenty Beauty it's
perfect for holiday because it's super
sparkly I've already dipped into it as
you can see it's been loved already so
I'm gonna tell you guys exactly what you
need to know about this palette in my
sheet here that I have and it says here
that it is a limited edition galaxy
eyeshadow palette with hyper reflective
Sparkle meets a rainbow of 14 celestial
inspired colors that range from sheer
glittering top coats to a smoky shimmer
drenched hues like jewelry for your eyes
that sounds very nice
these glimmering eyeshadows and top
coats are the ultimate accessory for
every look we're gonna try to use a few
different colors and because with things
that have a lot of reflect or glitter
either you like to use my finger to
apply them or I like to use a flat
concealer brush because I feel like that
packs everything on really nicely before
we dip into the eyeshadow palette I'm
going to clean up my lid space so that
it has a nice blank canvas you guys can
see the colors nice and true so I'm
taking some Mac Paint Pot and this is in
soft ochre on a flat concealer brush and
I'm gonna cut the crease a little bit
just clean all this eyeshadow up that we
have here I really do love this
technique just makes everything so much
easier to clean up and like make your
crease look really sharp and then you
want to fade the shadow base into that
eye shadows that we have and the outer
part of the eye so now that we have the
lid all cleaned up nice and ready to go
I'm going to use
violent boss a glitter adhesive reason
I'm using this is because I don't want
to have a lot of fallout and there is a
lot of glitter in the palette I would
recommend doing your foundation last if
you're working with any glitters at any
time but Here I am over here doing my
foundation first
so dab this on all over the eyeshadow
base that we just laid down and don't
like open your eyes fully when you have
this on you don't want it up in your
crease alright I'm just letting it sit
letting it get slightly tacky I'm gonna
take a flat concealer brush slightly
cleaned off and we're gonna pick up this
color right here which is super pretty
and pigmented this one is more of that
like rich reflex so look you can see
this one has a very strong base color
and it's pretty glittery go ahead and
take that on the lid and I'm gonna pack
it on with my finger first and then what
I need to get close to the crease I will
use the concealer brush I'm actually
mixing these two now this one and this
green shade right over here boom boom oh
yes I'm actually gonna take this all the
way out over here just cuz I felt like
the reddish color was a little too light
for the lid color so with chopping
motions I'm just patting it in and kind
of great eating this out so now I'm
gonna have to do a little bit of cleanup
work here I'm gonna take a makeup wipe
and it's okay I'm gonna just kind of
redo this area of my face right here
hopefully it's not too bad so I'm gonna
fix it first I'm gonna take my Beauty
Blender which has no product on it I'm
gonna pounce over the area that I just
cleaned up with the makeup boy this is
what I like to call patchwork this is a
cool new product from the line as well
this is called Eclipse chew on one
glitter release eyeliner so this is like
a nice cool toned Mavi shade and it
looks pretty mad I mean like a satin
finish but there's definitely no glitter
but the cool thing about this eyeliner
is that after this eyeliner dries if you
rub it it's supposed to all of a sudden
give you a glitter finish so you could
either use your finger or a brush is
what it says just glitter a blade up on
AIM since we're here I'll show you the
other shades too so that was Lake that's
crater which is this one and then we
have Neptune this one so for this
eyeliner I would say it has more of like
a
undertone but then there is reflux of
like a bluish or green color to that as
well could see a little bit more of a
green reflect there and then the last
liner we have here is called alien bay
see I can definitely see that this one
here has more of a green tone and then
this one is more of the blue tone I'm
gonna use this liner in the crease and
then I'm gonna actually pack some more
eyeshadow on top to give like this cool
effect where it breaks up the cut crease
in the center so that's what we about to
do I'm kind of nervous right now because
you know I feel like I can't breathe
whoo this step is not absolutely
necessary but once I put that I shadow
over it it's gonna look good you don't
have to do this stuff but I did it the
other day and I thought it looked really
cool but let's go back to these liners
now that I think they're dry kind of
already rubbed this one on accident but
let's take a brush and test so if you
want to rub over the liner which I
smudged oh look see it does start to
turn into glitter what that one has a
really cool finish I think this one's my
favorite just cuz it's the actually the
blue one comes in close second but I
think this one's so unique I really like
how one of this stuff is just like
different different types of products
that you know we don't really see
everyday you know I was gonna go over
the white line with the shadow but I
kind of feel like it does give it more
of like a galaxy look like um I don't
know like there's a shooting star
through my crease so I'm gonna keep it
because I think it looks cool taking my
Becca beige concealer and I'm gonna
apply that on the under eyes y'all and
then I also just for like a tiny bit
more coverage I'm gonna take the tart
shape tape in San and just put that I
just like to put like a line here and a
line here I don't like to use a lot cuz
I like more of a hydrated
my under I love love love this green
like if I show up to Christmas with you
izombie poppin you know but you guys
know I'll be like with my no makeup
makeup look stuffing my face
I believe I'm already thinking about
Christmas mmm
concealer makes such a difference now
I'm gonna take medium buy tart tart
medium tart shape tape and I'm gonna do
like a little down the nose cuz you just
can't have right under eyes and nothing
else you know if you just put bright
under your eyes and nowhere else on your
face you're gonna look flat blend it out
with the beauty blender you really want
to diffuse these little this little tree
you made on your forehead you don't want
any harsh lines so you don't want it to
set and dry like that and with the nose
I almost do want it to set and dry like
this harsh line cuz I want that straight
line down the nose so I'm gonna blend
that at last here's one of the Holiday
Collection fenty beauty brushes it's
dual ended so there is a fluffier flat
side on this side and then there's more
of like a I would say lower lash line
area detail brush on this side I'm gonna
take the Mac Studio Fix powder and this
isn't a shade close to my skin tone and
I'm gonna lightly lightly just Pat that
over my under eyes not a lot because
this is a very heavy product but just a
little and what this does is it gives
the translucent powder that you're gonna
set with something to really glide over
opposed to like crease up in those edges
and I swear I like tend to crease less
when I do this but you just can't
overwhelm the under eye with a lot of
products so just kind of hit it it's
like a light hand and then I'm gonna go
ahead and put my Laura Mercier right on
top of that I'm gonna let that chill for
a second and we're gonna go ahead and
hit the inner corner with another
eyeshadow from the
fenty palette I want to try to use as
many colors as I can but I also don't
want to look like I got into my mom's
makeup as a child because I may look
like that but it's okay we're gonna go
into this color right over here which is
so pretty
god I wish my lights showed these
shadows better but this color right here
is so beautiful like aquamarine dreams
mermaid dreams so I'm gonna just tap
into that this is a tiny little detailed
shadow brush from zoeva 237 and I want a
concentrated amount
this in the inner corner so I'm going to
spritz my brush one more time and I'm
gonna play it right here in this gap
that we have oh so pretty I'm just
lightly gonna tap around the edges to
kind of diffuse it out a little bit but
I don't want to talk too hard because I
don't want to get it everywhere so
that's the inner corner highlight done
now let's go ahead and smoke out the
lower lash line so we can balance the
eye because right now I'm looking real
top-heavy I'm gonna go back into this
pallet and kind of mimic what I did with
the crease so I'm actually gonna pick
this color up in this bright orange
together and start on this outer part of
the V and connect it to what we have
here so starting from the outer part and
I'm using a I forgot to say I'm using a
Smith 235 and now going back into this
greenish shade that we used up top I'm
gonna go ahead and smoke that on the
outer part of the eye lower lashline for
that I'm using my favorite brush
Joseph's colors pencil brush and we're
gonna connect the outer V at the top
with lower lash line
my mom's visiting me tomorrow I mean no
not tomorrow Friday so yeah my mom is
here now if you guys are watching this
and I am probably on the couch at this
moment being fed cotton asada and being
spoiled by her which is my favorite time
I give like one little coffee and she's
like oh me how are you sick like let me
put Vicks VapoRub all over you and I'm
like yes
take care of me so next I'm gonna take
this Victoria Beckham liner this is balm
this is the Estee Lauder Victoria
Beckham liner and it has like a block
and a nude color this is like the best
black liner ever it's does not move it's
super black it stays in your waterline
I'm like obsessed with it so I don't
want to close my eyes off too much
because the look is already so glittery
and everything so I'm gonna open them up
with the nude color and make your eyes
look a little more a week alive next I'm
going in with the Shayla X Maybelline
the colossal Big Shot baddest black
mascara and I'm gonna put
my lashes just to coat them for the
falsies for lashes I'm gonna go in with
the Lily lashes and these are in the
style makeup by Samuel they taper so
they're like shorter in the in the
inside and then longer on the outside
which is going with the shape that we're
going for here propping them up once I
got them on taking Mac extended play
mascara and I'm gonna graze my lower
lashes look how much better the glitter
actually looks when you're in normal
lights but my studio lights make it look
not as glittery a look at that oh now
we're gonna do a little bit of bronzer
this is a shade oh five by Guerlain mom
your Nonnie kind of high up actually
pushing that into the hairline and this
is a Smashbox brush then take it all the
way around the hairline here now that
we've done that we're gonna contour the
nose a little bit and for that I'm going
to be using the hoola bronzer by benefit
and then also like connecting the brow
bone right up here now I'm going to use
the Fenty highlight and I'm gonna be
using this shade right here which is a
hustla baby right here I'm also gonna
take that at the tip of the nose right
here Cupid's bow all the usual places
alright so for the final touches I'm
gonna go into the lips but there are
some different items here for lips in
the new collection let's just go over
these first we have the cosmic glosses
which are these right here this one is
called space suit so let's just give a
little swatch so these are like super
metallic there's lots of reflex in here
then we have Astro naughty which is this
deeper shade right here
I like this color a lot actually
this one is platonic relationship we're
gonna hit this one
right here that one's also really
pigmented it's like a Barbie gloss
lastly we have this shade right here
which is called gal on the moon
next in the collection there's four star
light hyper glit hyper glitz lipsticks
it's kind of hard to say packaging it
looks just like the palette it has a
little fun T beauty stamp on the top of
the lipstick which i think is nice nice
little detail and this one is the shade
supernova next we have super moon it's a
pretty coral shade next we have a side
fly I should win an award for world's
worst swatch Katie would not be proud
right now and then lastly we have
gravity gravity is such a barbie shade
and it actually looks really really
pigmented and pink on the lips the best
swatches award award for best launches
goes to me thank you so much okay so I'm
gonna finish this look off with the lips
the eyes are pretty sparkly and I want
them to stay that the star of the show
so I'm gonna be using first as a base a
pretty nude lipstick this is Mac a
girl's got needs I'm just kind of using
this color as a nice evening out base so
over top of that I'm going to be using
supermom from the collection I fear that
if I hit it with gloss it's gonna like
throw off the eyes because the eyes are
super green but I'm gonna do it anyway
cuz I bet in my line I'm gonna do it
anyway cuz I want to I'm gonna just in
the center use a spacesuit gloss is
making a huge comeback right now gotta
mark my word alright guys that's it oh
this is the finished makeup look
intergalactic intergalactic enjoy go
nocturnal terrible actor I love the

with just stand out i shadow z-- this is
very glittery okay do you see this money

is a unique palette I love all the
glitter all the reflex holiday dreams I
also really loved this liner later

combo of lip of course I'm gonna pick
the new do you guys know I'm just like
