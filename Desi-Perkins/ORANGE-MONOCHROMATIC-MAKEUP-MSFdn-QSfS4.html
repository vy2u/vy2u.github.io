today's video is gonna be on this makeup
look I wanted to do a monochromatic
makeup look that just said spring and
oranges I was really wanting to play it
with just orange tones all over so the
eyeshadow the lips just like the blush
area and just keep it all very orange so
that's what I did today I think it's
really good for spring I think it's
really fun bright colors I also used a
lot of new products that I've never used
before but that I've been hearing a lot
about through social media like people
raving about new highlighters and new
foundation so I'm using those for the
first time in this tutorial as well so
if you're interested then keep watching
I'm going to apply a primer and I've
been using the Smashbox photo finish
primer water you know it's one of those
things where you can't really realize
too much if it's working yet but my
makeup has been staying on I've also
been wearing a lot of makeup so I don't
know man
I'll try to keep you guys posted but I
love how it feels so I wear it yes so
continuing with the skin prep I'm going
to apply a plumping balm and it's by
Pete it's one of those bombs that is
supposed to plump your lips let me know
if you see them getting bigger all right
so I'm trying out a new foundation this
is the Clinique beyond perfecting I just
picked this up at Sephora yesterday a
lot of people have been talking about
this it's really full coverage it's
supposed to be a foundation plus
concealer in one so that means it's
really heavy coverage I had a hard time
picking out my foundation shade it was
either too dark or too pink or too light
this is the best option we'll see how it
looks on camera
it's the shade number 8 golden neutral
has a little doe foot applicator alright
so I'm just gonna use the applicator I
think this is like for convenience
however I'm not really a fan of it
because I feel like once you touch your
face it like is gonna spread bacteria
back into the bottle when you dip it
back in I'm really hoping this looks
good because there's no turning back
after I apply it I'm going to take my
Beauty Blender start working into the
skin
yeah that's definitely very full
coverage I wish it was like a pinch
darker but it's not terrible once I had
bronzer and stuff it was weird because
the color selection for this foundation
it's like they have a lot of colors but
I needed something slightly darker
everything the step above darker was
really really pink and then the step
above that was like super super dark
felt like this was the only shade that
matched the undertone of my skin they do
have like a lot of colors though the
foundation looks really good on camera
what is the finish on this foundation
does it say it's for dry combination -
combination oily mix that's every skin
type let's just say it's matte satin and
dewy because cover all the bases all
right gotta do a ginger concealer so I
was running out so I'm gonna go ahead
and apply my go to a fresh tube so
beautiful
Steven says that I apply a lot of
concealer that's why I run out so much
how dare you he doesn't understand that
I'm highlighting you know what I mean
I'm gonna go ahead and blend that out
with my Beauty Blender so excited I'm
getting my extensions put in to see how
short it looks right now it looked like
longer because I had little individual
extensions right here because this part
of my hair with like a lot of people's
hair isn't that thick or full on the
sides still going to be sure it's just
gonna look a lot more fluffy like a lot
of celebrities who have short hair have
extensions in you just don't know
because they're sure but it just adds so
much body and I'm excited because
Priscilla is doing my extensions and she
is like a huge celebrity hairstylist who
does everyone's extensions pretty much
alright so next we're just going to go
ahead and set the concealer right away
so I don't crease too much using the
same thing I always use my Laura Mercier
setting powder with my dose of colors
setting powder brush I'm just lightly
setting them I don't want to look too
cakey or matte I want to
fresh next I'm going to be blowing up my
skin using the Bobbi Brown foundation
stick this is in the shade almond so I'm
going to use this as my contour and I'm
just going to go ahead and blend that
out with my Marc Jacobs the shape brush
and I'm keeping this focused on this
outer part of the cheekbone I like using
this as a contour cream when I want a
more sunkissed look because it's a
little bit warm but it also blends
really nicely I've been using this since
I first started doing makeup really or I
remember I use this a lot when I first
started my Instagram account see it just
looks really nice pretty fresh it's not
too crazy it's not too much I'm also
going to do that same thing on the
perimeter of my hairline this is just
going to balance out the sunkissed look
really push it into the hairline as well
whatever is left over on my brush I'm
just going to Pat on the jawline so this
is like nice and bronzed now not bronzed
so I'm just going to lightly lightly set
the cream bronzer with a little bit of
these colors from the ELF bronzer
palette just a very light application
just like enough to set the powder but
not make it super matte or powdery for
blush when using becca cosmetics and
this is the luminous blush in Tigerlily
next I'm going to apply a liquid
illuminator this is the sephora of
radiant luminizing drops in morning
light it's gonna take a little bit on
the back of my hand just so I don't grab
too much then I'm just gonna apply ooh
see that was a little much it's okay we
can blend it lightly Pat that in the C
formation here I almost forgot to
contour my nose so I'm slightly
contouring it using my Mac Studio Fix
powder and NC 45 and I'm going to be
using the SL miss glam contour brush I'm
just lightly applying this along at the
side of my nose
before I apply my powder highlight I'm
going to first set my face with the mac
fix+
that's now currently spitting on me like
a camel I'm just going to use the Urban
Decay setting spray because I'm almost
out and right before the setting spray
set I'm going to apply the highlight
just going to give it a more intense
luminous highlight it's the first time
I'll be using the Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighting powder which I've also been
seeing everywhere this is the shade
precious petals applying that using my
Laura Mercier highlighting brush oh
that's really pretty
yes what in wild just going to go in
that same C formation here okay I'm also
going to be applying that the tip of the
nose and the Cupid's bow so next I'm
just going to move on to the eyes I'm
going to be priming them first using my
Mac prep and prime and this is the 24
hour extend eye base and I'm just using
my finger to distribute the product all
over the lid and the crease next we're
going to go into the shadow I'm going to
be picking up hair docks from the Alice
Through the Looking Glass by Urban Decay
and this color is just like a fresh
peach shade and I'll be applying that
using my inspire to a to a fluff brush
is really good for the outer corners I'm
picking this up and I'm going to pack
the product on the outside of the eye
and I'm going to take a blending brush
and soften the edges and blend it out a
little bit that peach shade wasn't
showing up as intense as I wanted it to
so I'm going to pick up this NYX palette
instead the ultimate shadow palette in
brights and I'm going to go ahead and
pick up these two shades right here and
start applying those to the outer parts
of my crease yes this is a little bit
more what I was going for just going to
pick it up with a fluffier brush
now I'm going to go ahead and just take
this orange color right here and apply
that on the lower lash line I think I'm
just going to apply it on the outer part
we'll see how I feel about it this is
the dose of colors flat definer brush
it's good to pack I shadow is like this
on these bright colors with a denser
brush and then blend it out afterwards
as I go closer to the inner part of the
eye I'm just slightly using less
pressure less product and making it a
little thinner then you could just use a
blending brush and soften that up a bit
for the lid I'm just going to apply
satin by a BH so I'm just taking that
satin color and lightly applying it to
the lid and buffing it out if you have
your blending brush that you used for
the outer corners just take that and
softly buff those edges together to
highlight the inner corners of my eyes
I'm going to be using this Pacifica trio
this shade right here which is called a
skinny dip I like Pacifica because it's
a all natural brand this inner corner
highlight really glows now we're going
to go ahead and curl our lashes I just
got this new lash curler honestly I
don't know how to say the brand sue
can't really see what it says Zuma zuma
sue Matt it's really hard to read they
recommend it to me at Sephora and it's
honestly the best lash curler I've ever
used ever and you know I don't have the
most long lashes so I can only imagine
what this does for somebody who has
really long eyelashes because it gets
them to sit up really well I decided to
do a winged real quick I'm gonna mix
these two liners these are both by color
pop this one is bright orange it's
called puffy and this one is called
sweet tooth it's a little bit more
bronze II I don't want it to be too
bronze or too orange so I'm just gonna
mix the two of them together just see
what happens so I'm just keeping it
really close to the lower lash line and
I don't actually think I'm gonna wing it
out I think I'm just gonna leave it like
that that way to add some some
definition to the lash line I think if I
wing it out it's going to just blend
into the shadow so now I'm going to
apply some mascara this is the Smashbox
x-rated mascara and this is supposed to
be a flake proof smudge proof mascara
so now I'm going to go ahead and apply
some false lashes these are the queen
bee Koko lashes now we're gonna move on
to lips I'm gonna do a really bright
orange e red lip I'm just gonna line it
with this color it's a Mac Ruby woo it's
not super orange E but I'm gonna cover
it anyways so it's more of just to give
me a guide for lipstick i'll be using
electro and this is by mellow beauty
just a matte bright bright orange e red
actually got this lip color in my Ipsy
glam bag this month and I was excited to
try it because I saw Shannon so post a
picture of these lipsticks so that's it
we're done with the makeup tutorial I
think it came out really fresh really
springy all that good stuff all in the
same color family let me know what you
