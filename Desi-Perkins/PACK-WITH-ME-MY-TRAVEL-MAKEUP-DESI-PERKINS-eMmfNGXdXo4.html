thought I would film a video showing you
guys how I pack my makeup for travel I
get so many questions what I use what I
bring how I pack it do I carry it on do
I check my makeup I'll give you the
answer right now I do not check my
makeup there's been a few times where I
have checked it but for the most part I
always carry my makeup on because I just
can't risk it you know it's like there
are certain things that I just need TAV
and I know I can't get especially if I'm
in other parts of the world so I always
put my makeup in my carry-on it just so
happens that I'm going on a trip in a
couple of days and I'm so so excited I'm
going to EB is it EB you guys know what
I'm talking about I'm gonna be packing
all of my more tropical makeup things
that I like to wear when I'm you know
doing beachy things let's go ahead and
get right into my makeup bag boom this
is the makeup bag that I travel with it
is my absolute favorite I've been using
it over and over and over again and it
just has the best compartments and I
will link everything down below if you
don't bring that much makeup there's
another makeup bag that I have that I'll
travel with and let me show you guys
that one excuse me this is another
makeup bag option which I really really
like and this is in collaboration with
its Judy's time and it's sold at
Walgreens it's really really nice
because it has little compartments so
you can put all of your tools or your
palettes I like that it has little
holders here I usually carry all my
liners and stuff like that and then
there's an empty pouch here which I'll
put my pallets this bag is tiny but
mighty okay you open the zipper and you
have this really really deep container
where you can just have all your
floating things which I really like
everything fits in it and you can really
shove all the stuff in there and jam
pack it if you need to but it also like
just looks really small
going back to this makeup bag this is
definitely my main bag what I like about
this especially with traveling if you
are checking your makeup this is a lot
more firm so if people throw it around
which I know it happens I am always like
really nervous about that but if that
happens it's very much protected okay
and when you open it up it is
compartmentalized it comes with little
dividers you can customize all of your
sizing and again I like that this is a
little more stiff because it'll protect
my makeup better I also love that in the
flap here there is an area for all of
your brushes or you can put all of your
liners mascaras things that are shaped
like that and then there's also a zipper
here which fits like like a whole arm is
in here mmm
hello Dona I've showed you guys the
goods let's start filling it up with
everything that I pack and how I pack it
okay when traveling it's always good to
pack pallets and the reason I love
pallets is because you can really narrow
down everything we all know I love my
neutrals and bronze shades so I'll
typically take one pallet either
something like this that has all of
those tones or my custom palette that
has all of my deep potted eyeshadows
this is kind of the one I've been using
for neutral tones lately I'll bring
another palette that has some brights
let's be real okay I am wearing no
brights on my vacay it's just not my
vibe this is a morphe blush palette that
I've been using it's the 8w and like I
said it has a lot of different tones
depending on how you're feeling it's all
in this one palette instead of bringing
a bunch of different compacts and of
course this is something I travel with
literally everywhere I go it is my
favorite cheek topper this color right
here I love this so much for vacations
this is just so beautiful it gives you
the nice flushed glowy cheek look
another palette I've been using which
I'm going to be packing with me is
another morphe palette this is
the 8h this has so many different color
bronzers contour powder and four
different colored highlights I know that
right here I have pretty much everything
I need for the face what we're gonna do
with those I just like to start taking
them and sliding them in here and you
could fit so many pallets in here it's
insane like they just keep keep going
and then I just kind of zip that up so
now let's get into the meat and potatoes
I always pack my makeup according to how
I apply it that way
I don't forget anything so I'll start
with the first thing I use my Mac strobe
cream goes with me everywhere I love
this it just gives your skin a really
nice glowy look boom we're gonna put it
there and then we have mac fix+ we're
gonna put that in there now we're gonna
go into foundation I'll be using Lancome
and NARS and I know a lot of people are
worried about carrying on fluids as long
as the ounces are under three fluid
ounces it's totally fine to carry it on
if you want to put them in ziplock bags
to be a plus student then do so I
definitely never do and I don't get
caught up but that's what they would
like you to do so you know do what you
will
next I'll pack some of my glow products
this is just one I've been loving it's
the Bobbi Brown all-over glow let's put
that in there
the Charlotte Tilbury flawless filter
amazing under foundation kind of like a
primer contour stick this is also from
Lancome it's actually foundation but I'm
gonna bring that there because you never
know how tan you're gonna get on your
vacation and if you have something
that's slightly darker than your skin
tone not only can you use it to bronze
but you could also use it to mix into
your other foundations and you know
match your newly tanned body to your
face concealers these are the concealers
I've been using right now oh my god
surprise surprised I've changed it up on
you my
nars concealer which I haven't used in
so long and I've actually been using it
and my new dior concealer that I've been
loving so we're just gonna put those in
there I like to keep all the face
liquids in one area so next we're moving
into powders this is the translucent
powder I'm going to be bringing it's the
peach perfect to face powder so I just
kind of put that there
this is a makeup forever banana powder
it's just nice and brightening I'm gonna
put that right there as well and then of
course you know you can't leave the
house without your boy go and me demand
by dose of colors so I'm packing
Meeta mate with me on the trip boom
okay right there wait there's Fuego okay
I'm not leaving without so I go at all
and what's nice is that usually if I
don't have palettes you can fill all of
this with blushers whatever you want but
since I have all the palettes look at
all the space I got this is something I
pack with me it's actually a candle
holder I got it at Michael's craft store
and I use this as a mixing plate for my
foundation so if I want to do a pump of
glow pump a foundation I don't have to
use the back of my hand I could just put
it on this when I travel and it just
works for me so I'll always find a place
for that just or you just you know I
don't know boom lashes you always want
to make sure to bring lashes I'm gonna
be getting lash extensions so I'm not
gonna bring a lot but on the nights that
I want to feel extra frisky okay and get
buck wild I might eat an extra lash so
I'm gonna go ahead and pack those we can
customize this however so let's just
make up space for lashes right here
because we gotta like that now I like to
have all my brow stuff brows are very
very important
this is actually my soap that I use
because you know I like to do soap brows
if you haven't seen my soap brow YouTube
tutorial I will link it down below but
soap is the best thing to tame brows and
I just put it in this way Mint folder so
that it's like not all over the place
then of course I'm gonna go ahead and
pack my brow products these are my
benefit foolproof and mica brow I like
to bring this on make
especially because if I'm gonna be in
the water I need my brow to also stay in
the water with me and on my face in
general so this is a pretty waterproof
and then I'll set it with the powder and
it's just like you are locked down okay
of course I always have to bring a brow
pencil because sometimes brow pencils
are just the way to go there fasts are
easy you can do quick touch-ups throw it
in your bag this is my Kat Von D brow
pencil I love this pencils so much boom
since I have so much space in the brow
section I'll usually pack my tools with
my brow stuff for example my scissors
you need scissors I always have those in
there and I've never had problems
carrying that on my chapstick this is my
Bobbi Brown chopstick because you know
you gotta hydrate those lips tweezers
don't forget tweezers they're very
important for tweezing things and also
applying my lashes eyelash curler a must
for me especially on tropical trips
because when I don't want to wear makeup
I just kind of curl my lashes and it
makes a huge difference this is
something else I bring with me in my
makeup bag it's my color wow if you guys
have sparse hair line or you just want
to wear your hair up in a tight slicked
back look you know how sometimes there's
like you can see your scalp through it
in certain areas when you slick it back
really tight this is just a powder that
fills all that in so that it looks super
full and nice another glow product that
I forgot to add in my face products my
iconic London original glow I will put
that right there almost forgot I also
keep my mascara in the brow section and
my gel liner this is my tea glop gel
liner now I want to pack my beauty
blenders I always bring a regular sized
Beauty Blender and then my mini and this
is for like detail work put them in a
ziplock bag like this it's good to carry
a Beauty Blender cleaner with you as
well so that you can clean your whoyou
blender after every use
and then I just pop it anywhere oh my
goodness I almost forgot my lash glue
that also goes in the tools and now it's
time for lips I will put all my favorite
lipsticks in just the section right here
this is my dose of colors does the X
Katy over-the-top gloss favorite and it
just goes over everything and I'll just
take a nude lipstick or like three four
five nude lipsticks we have more creamer
please and then I have both of shayla's
lipsticks from her collab with
colour-pop which I love I have ooh
for a more tropical corley lip and then
quickie for you know another nude
because I have to have multiple nude
options and then I like to bring one
bright or a couple brights but usually I
typically go for red so I always bring a
red lipstick just in case and since I'm
packing for a tropical trip I'm not
gonna bring too many individual shadows
but if I was going on a more grand base
trip where I wanted to really like show
out with my makeup I would also then
pack in here Urban Decay Midnight Cowboy
glitter liner because you can kind of
jazz up a look with that it's always
good to bring one product that can jazz
up your whole look really easily and it
can kind of work with any colors now for
all of our pencils these are lip liners
eyeliners that liquid liners things that
are in pencil form this kind of work I
put all of these pencils and I make sure
to have them facing up so that I can see
what everything is I'll keep all my lip
liners together and then all my
eyeliners together you can put your
brushes in here if you want
I usually don't I just put all my liners
you could also put glitter liners in
here shadow sticks whatever tickles your
fancy if there's a flap over it so that
it covers your brushes if you're doing
that then we just close it up and we are
all intact everything is nice and
organized in here what's really nice
about the system is I'm never rummaging
through my things when I get to my
destination it's all compartmentalized
so it stays that way when I'm doing my
makeup sometimes okay because I'm pretty
messy let me just show you what else
excuse me then I will pack all my
brushes in a brush container and just
like this this is makeup forever there's
a lot of companies that
make them it's just really nice because
close it up they stay nice and clean and
then when you get to your destination
you just open it up and you can separate
your brushes between face brushes and
eye brushes and they stay standing up so
it's just really easy to you know what I
mean
lastly if you are a makeup lover and you
do full glam on your vacations it's
always nice to have something with a
light because when you get to the hotel
you're about to see my camera okay
that's inception this is a mirror I just
started using I got it from glam core
it's so awesome because it turns on and
the light gets like really really really
bright extremely bright way more bright
than the last light I was using it
wasn't as powerful perfect for makeup
what's great as it comes with a little
stand and the stand is adjustable as it
comes in its own little pouch too you
just fold it all up it's not bulky at
all it's battery-operated and you have
your light just in case hotels can be
dark and they can play you you don't
want to take those chances
pack it up also put it away in your
carry-on and that is it you guys that is
how I pack my makeup when I travel I
hope this video was helpful I know
there's a lot of questions as to like
what you can bring on the flight what
you can't bring this is just how I do it
and I've never had any problem but I've
never had an issue packing my makeup so
I hope you guys enjoyed this catch Aleta
somebody gets Stephen off the set he's
acting crazy okay oh we have a caller on
line one whoa that is a very hello you
know I can only do so much okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
