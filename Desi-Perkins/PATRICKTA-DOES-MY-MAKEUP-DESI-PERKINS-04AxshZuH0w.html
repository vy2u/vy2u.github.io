have a special guest today
Patrick ha he is a amazing celebrity
makeup artist I actually did a video
inspired by you recently chickens I love
all your look I honestly scream whenever
I watch your videos all the time I
screamed when I when I heard a my name
yeah so we have been filming all day
together we did a video for kids app so
if it's available by the time this comes
up I will let you guys know about it in
the description box we filmed a video
for him and we he was pulling up a film
video on my channel as well and I'm so
excited because I feel like there's so
many tips that has that if it's an honor
that you would like to share them with
people because you know not all people
share their tips like that so it's
really cool that he's here to you know
do this makeup look look is glowy skin
an easy shimmery eye and a bold resident
so when you pick on together what do you
say this thing more like gonna feel a
little bit I was using super fresh
yeah let's note that refreshing youthful
bright glowing sexy rich sleep money
baby
of course that's the kind of look it is
it is that would be the side although
let's go ahead and get started it I'm
gonna start off by moisturizing your
face with a little bit of lemare
moisturizer I'm using the moisturizing
gel I like this one because it's not as
thick like as the cream I'm going to
moisturize the lips with a little bit of
lip balm this is our second video we
just felt a chance I see it's my third
video and how much makeup have you done
today like four I did GG this morning I
did today I did a video with you and
it's our second Friday I don't know how
you're doing it truly freely so let's
start off by priming tool is I'm using
Tom Ford I primer duo
this is my favorite primer at the moment
I like it because it's not as like dick
I guess as the other ones I've been
using I used to use Mac soft ochre I
still love it I still love it I love it
I love it I don't want it to look like
there's too much going on on the I like
thick layers of products I mix saying
lemare foundation and tan forty-two are
my design of it in number seven and
Kevin akwonton Dacian and medium zero f7
I like to mix mix female and like
cocktail of foundations because because
I feel like the payoff is better maybe
just I'm using three amazing brands
Ohashi is what it is the reason why I'm
applying foundation on the eyelid I'm
doing the eyes first and I really want
the eye shadow to blend in with the root
with the rest of the foundation so I'm
going to put this on both eyes I'm gonna
put on a little bit of powder just to
set the foundation on the eyelid it
makes it easier for eyeshadow
application with my morphe palette I'm
using this color as my transition color
I think this is my favorite one heat you
can obviou so it's the only one that is
basically on this time I'm using a NARS
dome-shaped and then Beckham desi dome
shaped brush I don't know that's the
real name but that's what we're calling
it today and we're going to put this
right into the crease to create the
shape of dime I noticed a huge
difference between the way you shake
mine the way I shaved my eye I'm going
to have to like really inspect this
video so I could see you exactly what
you did I'm going to take the product
onto this go to colours brush and I'm
going to push the push the brush right
into the crease and then we're going to
blend up into the brow and once I feel
that most of the product is off the
brush and I can blend freely so the next
product that we use is this eyeshadow
shade it has a little bit of like a
pearly pink golden undertone I'm going
to say all the colors and I'm going to
spritz it with a little bit of success
so that it really just sticks on to her
eyelids really good I love applying 6+2
shimmer shadows makes that color
like so much more intense what would you
say your favorite eyeshadow cut Israel I
really like the Giorgio Armani eyes to
kill like a little pot in its bronze I
think it's like number five wrong coming
next shade I may be using is called
Allison this is from the by that boss
Terrell palette and I'm just going to
take it actually with my blending brush
that I've been using for the crease
color and this sort of like lightly dust
this right over to like kind of
intensify the pink that's already
happening right now thank you very much
did nothing nothing
I'm still going to put on the other side
just because in case it did the
slightest touch I'm going to put this
color right into the crease further
define the crease shape I'm going to
blend it out with the blending brush so
I'm going to go ahead and take this wipe
and just clean up underneath the eyes
and I'm going to kind of clean up the
mess time in fallout the fallout and
ever I wipe away like oh my god okay so
what is your kit for glowing skin I
always notice in all your photos all the
celebrities I mean they obviously have
good skin but you always make them glow
a lot I love mixing a bunch of hot
highlighters together cream highlighters
under under powder because I feel like
it just like makes the makeup like stand
out that much more I'm going to take a
like a little clean blending brush I'm
just going to blend I shadow that we
just did just cuz I don't want any harsh
lines I want to make sure that's that
her under eyes are super moisturize
because I remember in the last makeup to
your on your eyes were a little bit dry
and that concealer made a crease a
little bit I can't put the shirt the
short I always call it that heart-shaped
cave I can't put it like too close to my
under eye because it's just like it's a
little drying for me but I love it like
under here you know on the hollow so I'm
going to go ahead and finish the rest of
the face a pump of skin illumination by
Kevin a Quan a pump of the Numair soft
the soft blue foundation a lot of
going under a lot of time a lot of time
but it's all words there sometimes like
I want my foundation to be do if I want
to last long so I like my cue tarnation
but then I'll put in like my mat
foundation on top of it so it just it
just works today I'm going for a more
like glamorous look but when you're
doing think about home or long times I
don't like to wear as much as makeup I
spin out my foundations with oils and
then I also put it on with with a brush
first and spread it out like when I got
the foundation right into the Beauty
Blender and then put it onto the skin
I'm putting so much foundation on if
you're breaking out don't like get a
heavier foundation just just spot treat
it with concealers so then the rest of
your face can still look like somewhat
fresh and not go and doing it and then
you can just do extra coverage on your
breakout that's a good tip you know any
time I'm breaking out I do like I can't
control myself I just start to like put
so much foundation on and by the time
I'm done I'm like why did I do this to
myself I'll tell the story on my channel
because you guys don't know but I met
Patrick like three years ago sweetest
person in the world oh I'm sorry I like
saw photo of his work on Instagram and
it was like the most beautiful make a
because it looked flawless but the
person didn't look overdone they looked
so pretty and just like the best version
of himself I always can tell when it's
Patrick's work on a celebrity like
before I even know that he didn't their
makeup it's like a certain style this
was before he was doing a lot of like
celebrity makeup and I just knew it I
was like Patrick's gonna be such a big
thing like I know he's going to be doing
everyone's makeup and now he's doing
everyone's we go oh good thanks I
honestly like I've been dying through
the Omega for so long I was I was maybe
going to get a chance to do it when for
I think it was a SAG Award oh yeah she
called me last minute I did cuz you know
I was just like are you fish I mean I
knew you were going to be busy but I
thought I would throw throw it out there
I was too big of a party I might shoot
like have my first time dreaming up
sadly because what if you hated it doing
another person who like is a makeup
connoisseur who just loves makeup and
is good at it you're I mean you're so
amazing so it's like so nerve-wracking
I'm confident in your abilities I've
been the case what do you think of that
first look I really liked it I told you
like I love the way the eye shadow would
you even say if you did every day like
it well I told you the only thing that I
didn't like was the under eye but that's
like the concealer I just can't I can't
put it there I'm going with him soon I'm
using the NARS sauce not complete I
really like it for highlighting widow's
damage straight for the under eyes I'm
going to use NARS creamy concealer in
ginger I learned in our last video that
custard is just way too light I like to
use a little brush to blend out the
edges before I blend out with my Beauty
Blender just because I just like it to
look as just to use as possible then
we're going to push the product in with
the pointy side of the Beauty Blender
would you say that the Beauty Blender is
your favorite like face tool for
foundation we're sure until I get to fix
everything like for seamless and if you
put too much makeup on then you can make
kind of like wipe it off do you have
like a makeup horror story when I when I
used to work at Mac I would have all
these like girls coming to prom and
there's this one girl she came in with
her mom and she showed me like a picture
of this look I thought I could do it and
they honestly thought that she looked
great and she's like I hate it and I
like pride myself and like always trying
to make my client happy and I could not
make her happy I didn't know what to do
so now I can go myself
so did you go in the back anchor I like
one of my first times in LA I did her
makeup I'm not gonna say - I left I
crying I thought like oh my god I was so
excited to be in today like I want to
kill it here I want to like make
something of myself and my first
impression was her and I thought that oh
my god I'm not going to make it here now
that I look back I'm like oh my god why
did I even cry you weren't ready yeah I
wasn't I would definitely was not ready
for LA a tip for aspiring makeup artists
when I first came here I was like I want
to do pieces well I want to do these
people think everything happens in
and you should never rush anything you
have one chance excel at all these
places because if I do your makeup and
you don't like it you cannot going to
call me again so put the under eye I'm
going to apply Laura Mercier powder this
is the universal translucent I want to
make sure the under eye is super nice
and pressed in so there's no creasing
gonna do like a light bake baby they may
be baked
so the next part I'm going to use I'm
going to contour the face with Too Faced
milk chocolate and light/medium and it's
going to go into the perimeter of the
face down the hollows of the cheek bone
I like to do like pressing motions
because I feel like if I swipe then my
like foundation will move I'm trying to
venture out in my bronzer like you like
give me sad I just need to stop using
give me some just so I can explore
what's out there you know what's on the
what's on the market I feel like I don't
give anyone else a chance you're that
kid in here he right here so let's be
here later we both thought the same
thing you better act right
you stood other things so I'm going to
apply a blusher I'm giving I'm doing
warm saw by MAC Cosmetics when I pick up
my blush I like to use blush colors that
are in the same like family to like
color tone since I'm doing like a
beautiful bold red lip I want to have a
little bit of aegyo red undertone in the
blush color I like the way you do makeup
because you can't really see where one
part of the makeup starts and the other
ends for example you know your blush
goes perfectly into the bronzer the
highlight and everything just kind of
like goes into one well thank you I'm a
little bit of this blush color just
right into the crease too because I
always like to put my blush color into
the crease or highlighters Linux to
today I'm a blender both by Laura Geller
I'm going to use gilded honey but also
I'm going to use peach glow because we
are in that like pinky family right now
so I can I can blend the two things
together
I'm going to kind of go in a u-shape and
put it right up on the high points of
the cheekbones that I'm using a Sadie
brush I like to
is like if you I shadow brushes to apply
what is it very cool it's say me say me
say me and I'd like to use eyeshadow
brushes to apply highlighters just
because I feel like the application is a
lot more precise and we're going right
above the eye pie about what it's right
down the bridge of the nose and both the
Cupid's bow take peach glow and we're
going to top that katie loves this one
she was using it for a hot minute we're
going to put that right onto the high
point one of these like that I love the
forehead more of a golden this is going
to be more of that peachy look I'm gonna
go ahead and go in what's that same
blush brush and just merge the two
powders together
I had does he do her eyebrows before
they're slowly disappearing my mother
literally is like I've had them on for a
lot of hours and through the look
they're not leaving there anymore so
before I finish eyes because her because
I think her face is a little bit powdery
so I'm I want to just miss the eyes I'm
gonna miss the rest of the face with
success just so it gives you a chance to
know notes notes into her skin got my
eyebrows are no you're showing me like
looking cold message I you know I'll get
out that just like touch me up you do oh
my god it's so interesting to know so
I'm going to go in with chocolate brown
for underneath the eyes so I'm flying
this right underneath the eyes and I'm
using that NARS brush I use this brush
for everything just to like blend out on
this eyes I'm going to connect the two
towards the end I'm going to go in with
a Nastasia soft brown I'm just going to
fix the brows with it because they've
been through a rough day slowly
disappearing and you are like the queen
of brows I am NOT I have to like perfect
brows so I don't have the brow hair so I
have to like actually create a head of
nothing we expected I thought to Zuri oh
this looks so pretty all right I'm gonna
go ahead go ahead with the l'oreal bloom
is carbon black this is my favorite
mascara even gives people a after day
you want to Torian no never you such a
thing okay you know I can take it
so I'm gonna line the lips while we wait
for the glue to dry the Glenn Cocco
lingo you did my hair snatch him I'm
using cherry lip liner by Mac and I'm
not going to do eyes as bright up a red
on the lips and they're more of a
orangie red I think this was good with
great cherry is pretty universal
any word oh my god wait I was having
some you were there seminar oh yeah
funny
and I was lining the lips and someone
from like Instagram stories live they
come is there a reason why you don't
you're not making a clean line that I
say I'm trying girl I'm so funny I'm the
first to admit and I had to like fix fix
my lip liner it's hard to do it on
anybody like to make up for Finland I'm
using the liquid lipstick in the colour
400 this is doesn't magnet by Armani ooh
I like that that's a rich yeah look
expensive
she looks rich elite I love how you get
glue that switch okay I'm going to fix
the lips after this I'm going to pop on
these lashes before they dry so we're
recycling kiss lashes and I don't know
what what kiss lashes and I don't know
what you can find hot Walgreen yeah you
know the Walgreens they I think it's
called little black dress and they're
