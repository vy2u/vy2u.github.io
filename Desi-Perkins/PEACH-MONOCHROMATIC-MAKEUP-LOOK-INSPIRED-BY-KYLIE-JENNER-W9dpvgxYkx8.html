today's video is going to be a makeup
tutorial on this peachy makeup look this
is actually a look inspired by makeup by
Arielle on Instagram he's an amazing
makeup artist his makeup looks are so
simple and striking at the same time I
don't know how to explain it but all his
looks are so beautiful I just love
looking at his makeup looks he actually
did this peachy monochromatic makeup
look on Kylie Jenner and when I saw the
photo on his page I was like I wanted to
have that makeup look on my face so I
thought I recreate it for you guys it's
super simple he doesn't use a lot of
product I didn't use exactly what he
used I just used what I had mixed some
stuff together and got this makeup look
so if you guys are interested then keep
on watching first I'm going to print my
skin I'm using the Epis 8 international
restorative toner it's gonna reduce
inflammation refresh and hydrate your
skin and toner always really helps if
you have any blemishes as well next I'm
just going to moisturize by using the
Naked cosmetics advanced aloe cream this
is a good non greasy anti-aging lotion
don't forget my neck since we're doing a
Kylie look I'm going to go ahead and try
this Too Faced lip injection extreme
clear gloss that is supposed to have
like lip plumping technology and I'm
just gonna put this on while I'm doing
my makeup just to get the plumping going
so by the time I'm ready to apply my lip
color hopefully they just magically look
like you know
moving on to eyes let's go in with the
benefit air patrol as our eyeshadow base
we're just taking that on a concealer
brush pack that all over the lid and
then blend it up towards the brow bone I
like to tap with my finger afterwards
just to make sure it's all nice and
smooth go ahead and set that like usual
with Blanc bio Nastasia Beverly Hills
first I like to put all the product on
the brow bone because that's where you
want the most highlight I sound like a
broken record sometimes but I feel like
I need to give you guys this tip in
every video just necessary though that
lip injection thing is definitely doing
something don't worry too much about
putting this on the lid just mostly on
the crease and the brow bone boom
this color basically blends into the
backdrop it's makeup geek Peach Smoothie
and this is going to be our transition
shade so I'm taking that on a Smith to
3/5 brush just putting that into the
crease and a little bit above the crease
so the transition color just kind of
gets the ball rolling around here just
helps you map out your shape you get all
your mistakes out of the way with the
lightest shade that way when you go with
the darker ones you're like okay I got
this for Kylie's makeup she used Citroen
from her eyeshadow palette supposedly
that's all that's on her eyes but I'm
gonna go ahead and use L'Orange
highlighter and this is by Anastacio
beverly hills and with a smith 2:47
brush this is kind of gonna be sort of
like a wash of color so I'm focusing it
mostly onto the crease but then kind of
bringing it down to the lid as well what
I like about Arielle's makeup looks is
that they're so subtle but so slight
stunning it's crazy like I don't know
how he does it every time every
makes everyone look so good with such
simple makeup looks to define the lash
line I'm going to smoke it out just a
little bit with this dark chocolate
brown this is fudge by Anasazi of
Beverly Hills picking that up on a Sigma
flat definer e15 brush basically just
want to tap that or press it into the
lash line just to add a little
definition to those eyelashes it also
helps give your eye a little more
definition as I'm out here I keep the
shadow kind of thick and then taper it
thinner and thinner as I get into the
inner corner to kind of give us that
like if you do it this thick all the way
around it'll give your eye a more round
appearance then after you tap it in just
kind of blend the edges into the peach
color so it softens it up even more so
once we apply our lashes over this it
won't even really show that much just
kind of define and hide the lash band a
little bit and then I'm taking the brush
that I use with the peach and kind of
just going right over it to soften it
and blend it all out so don't want it to
be anything too harsh moving on to the
face I'm using the Estee Lauder Double
Wear light Foundation and this is in the
shade 3.5
I give myself a nice little tan my face
is pale and I will go hard no I go home
for my concealer I'll be using the NARS
creamy concealer and ginger I'm just
going to apply a little bit of concealer
actually I'm just going to blend this
out before I go on to the other side
can I just pop that around the cheekbone
make that cheekbone pop a little bit
cover the shadows on the side of the
nose with the concealer as well to slim
it out I don't really want this to be
super sharp so I'm going back over it
with a blending brush and just kind of
smoking this out
no product on the brush just making sure
it's not like a sharp line somebody is
the laura mercier translucent powder to
set my under eyes and this is the Sigma
tapered highlight brush I'm a little
weary to put a lot of powder because of
the allergic reaction that I got going
on this week the under eyes look scary
I'm gonna bake the nose contour if you
will tape of that one time while
that's baking let's go ahead and contour
the nose
shall we so I'm going to take this
contour kit by hd-ready and it is in
collaboration with makeup by Yvonne and
I'm going to take this cool toned color
here and I'm going to try to contour my
nose and I say try because I'm trying to
use I love said II's methods right now
she just started a YouTube channel you
guys should go check her out she's one
of my friends you don't know she is you
should check out her Instagram she did a
nose contour video the other day and I
was like paying very close attention I'm
not doing exactly what she did but I'm
trying this is a really good nose
contour color actually it's my first
time trying it
you want to make sure to use grayish
tones not great but not warm tone to
contour the nose this is actually the
perfect color from what I see now
haven't really photographed with it
hopefully it looks good an outdoor
lighting that's the true test I'm going
to go ahead and dust this powder off now
I'm going to take my bare minerals Fair
Pro powder foundation and this is in the
shade camel toe
just kidding huh I'm so dumb and my
morphe e3 brush and I'm just going to
kind of press that into the face get
that full coverage look and I'm also
going to kind of Pat it over my nose so
that it blends my nose contour with my
face alright time for some Mac give me
Sun I'm gonna be using my Mac 135 to
apply that you want to get that nice
sunny glow that warm tone glow that's
why I like this give me Sun for this
ruining all my baby hair Sledge that I
had going on I try to lay my edges like
Shayla taught me so the reason I like to
use this big fluffy brush because it
just evenly gives your face and all over
sunny look and that's what we longed
nothing too precise her whole look is
very soft so that's the glow I'm looking
for to give my face a natural glow I'm
going to use the bellapierre cosmetics
mineral blush and this is an autumn glue
I'm using a Mac 137 this is a nice light
fluffy brush so that it doesn't apply
too much product kind of putting it over
the nose too to add the glow that peach
eNOS like right around here and the
actual blush she used for the look was
peachy keen by mac cosmetics if you guys
can't tell this is one of my favorite
blushes and I want to continue with this
brush just because I don't want to go
too crazy with the blush application for
my highlight I'll be using the champagne
pop shade with Jaclyn hill and Becca
cosmetics put that right there
I'm also going to put the highlight on
the tip of my nose Cupid's bow going
back into the l'orange color with my
favorite under-eye brush this is bee
Joseph colors pencil brush and we're
just gonna smoke it out right underneath
I'm actually going to mix that to tone
it down a little bit with Peach Smoothie
yeah it's perfect tones it down just a
little bit and then you want to just
connect the top with the bottom in the
ipsy glambag this month I actually got
super hero it cosmetics mascara supposed
to be a super black formula so I'm going
to use this to coat my lashes before
applying my falsies all right and then
for lashes I'm going to be using the
demi wispies and these are ones that I
customized with individual lashes if you
guys want to see a video on that I will
link it in the description box thank you
so much now I'm going to go ahead and
apply these make sure you come up from
above we want them to like really be
perky I know that in this photo she had
like individual lashes or lash
extensions I believe so customizing with
individuals will give you that effect
although hers were like a little bit
more PC these are actually from Mac a
lot of brands make them but they're
especially for eyelashes so you can
apply them and then you press them down
with your natural lashes so that they
look more natural so now that we have
our lashes on I'm going to do bottom
lashes if you have naturally long
eyelashes then go for that mascara I
don't so I really still want to have
that lashy look but I'm going to be
using house of lashes precious lashes
they are a strip lash but what I've been
doing recently and I find it's easier
for me to apply is actually cutting each
little section individually so then it
looks like this just a bunch of little
lashes and I apply them separately I
just have more control of the lash that
way it's just easier for me and I like
to be able to kind of change the way
they look I just put a little bit of
glue gonna put it in the inner corner
just a lot easier to do it this way for
some reason for me at least it feels
more comfortable there's not like a
little lash strip at the bottom of my
eye which sometimes bothers me so it's
nice you just kind of put them wherever
you want you have more control and more
say-so on what you want to do what else
I like about this technique is that when
you wear lower lashes sometimes I find
mine like pops off no matter how much
glue I put on when you do it like this
if one pops off is fine because the rest
of them are still going to be there
whereas when there are strict it's like
once it pops off you're just looking
crazy there now you have some lower
lashes and then once these dry you can
go back in with mascara and try to build
up your lashes in those little gaps or
you could leave it like this I kind of
like that PC look whatever floats your
boat I decided that I wanted to smoke
out the lower lash line just a little
bit just blend out the edges so I'll be
using a dirty little secret cosmetics
single eyeshadow in teaser just a nice
pigmented creamy shadow so I'm just
putting it like right below where we
have the peachy shade so it's a little
bit softer yes you need to check to see
if she had an inner corner highlight I'm
not sure you just I need to check these
check the receipts real quick pull
please it looks like she has a inner
corner highlight but it doesn't look
like it's sparkly so I'm just going to
use a Blanc type again just kind of put
that in the inner corners brighten it up
there all right so for the lips I
already kind of tested a little patch
but I'm mixing London by NYX and Oprah's
Rio to get that like dirty peachy color
cuz I don't have that color right now so
I just mixed it on the back of my my his
and right here
I mean it's not going to be exact but
try your best to mix whatever you have
at home to get the color all right so
this is the lip mix with those two
shades it's not exactly like dirty peach
but you know overall what you're trying
to get to is like a monochromatic peachy
look so anything you have at home that
you can make work make it work and it's
good you're golden
peach and peachy peachy keen alright
guys so that's it for this tutorial I
really hope that you guys enjoyed the
