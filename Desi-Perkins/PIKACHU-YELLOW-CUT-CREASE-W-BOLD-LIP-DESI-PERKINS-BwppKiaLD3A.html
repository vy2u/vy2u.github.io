hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today's video is gonna be a makeup
tutorial on this look right here I was
so excited to play with color and I was
really inspired by a photo that Alyssa
Marie artistry on Instagram put on her
page I will link her down below but she
did this really like smoky yellow look
it just inspired me to use that color
and I loved it it was beautiful
I wanted to pair that look with a bold
lip somehow even though this look is a
little over the top because it's a cut
crease and it's yellow and then there's
a bright lip but somehow everything
combined looks really fresh to me and
still very wearable I love how it turned
out it's actually one of my favorite
makeup looks that I've done so I really
hope that you guys enjoy it
let's go ahead and get started so I'm
gonna start by applying an under-eye
cream to my eyes that way while I do the
rest of my makeup it just kind of soaks
in and refreshes the under-eye area this
is the organic Serge daily care reviving
eye gel I'm going to pry my skin using
the Embera nice m3 embryo lease I'm
gonna use the embryo lease this is the
cream concentrate this is super popular
in the makeup artist community oh God a
lot of people use this I don't think
I've ever actually used this this is my
first time it came in the Ipsy glam bag
this month but I know in the the
professional makeup artist world this is
like the number one skin primer this is
a moisturizer and it Prime's your face
for makeup as well so today I filled in
my brows using the Benefit kübra and
this is just a 24 hour waterproof it's
like a gel brow cream to prime my lids
I'll be using Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
still till this day my favorite eye
primer and this is the luxe e18 - brush
this is in collaboration with JD 180 so
you just want to put a light layer of
this all over the lid up to the brow
bone next I'm just going to take the
Laura Mercier translucent powder this is
just the pressed powder on a Sedona lace
EB 13 brush and I'm going to set the
eyeshadow base with this I usually use
Mac Blanc type but you guys all know
what happened to that and I just said it
all the way down to my crease next I'm
highlighting my brow bone and this is
the shade classic it's from the restack
from milk cosmetics
these little stacks are so cool
mine's all dirty cuz I've been using it
a lot all the eyeshadows are like oh my
god it's so dirty oh my god I don't know
how that happened I never know how this
happens just gonna take that and pack it
on to the brow bone it's just gonna lift
our brow bone and give everything a nice
cleaner crisp feel I'm pretty much using
all of the eyeshadows from the rust
stack except for the lid color so the
next one we're gonna use is antique
eyeshadow I'm going to use a luxe e23
one brush which is this really nice
small blending brush so I'm gonna try to
get the shape that I'm going for
I'm just gonna kind of do a straight
line across I like these peachy orange
colors as a first shade to lay down to
really map out everything and then just
be the lightest shade that connects to
the brow bone highlight before I go in
with anything super dark it's very
forgiving and you can get a feel of
where the rest of your eyeshadow is
gonna get placed I'm just gonna do that
for now and if we need to use that color
later to blend it out we will next I'm
going to use this shade which is rubbish
I love this shade it's really really
nice it's like a mustardy Brown it's
like yellow undertones I'm going to be
using the pencil brush by dose of
colored I'm going to try to really map
out the shape now this is such a nice
brush one of my favorites so I'm
starting with this hollow of my eye
first and then I'm going to bring it out
and elongate the crease towards this
outer corner these colors are still
fairly light so like I said very
forgiving and I have the Luxy blending
brush close by with the first shade we
use just to blend it out and keep it
soft for now you're just going to want
to take that rubbish color and continue
to build on your shape this is still not
the darkest color we're going to use in
the crease so feel free to bring it up a
little higher than the line you just
made as your crease shape so if I made
the crease shape here feel free to kind
of blend it upwards just a little bit
more because ideally what you want is
the first color you put on to peak out
first then this rubbish shade and then
the darkest shade will be just in the
crease so that you have a nice gradient
okay so next we're going to use rust and
this color is one of my favorites called
everything I'm going to take that with a
- 15 small angled brush to get me a nice
precise line because we're going to
start to really define this crease make
it all booj okay well I'm going to start
with this outer corner and define the
very lowest part of the crease it's fine
if you mess up because we're going to
put a whole base on the lid and you can
just cut the crease even more so I'm
making kind of a harsh line and then I'm
taking my dose of colors pencil brush
and then blending the edges of that out
so then once you build up this shadow
whatever's left over on the brush curve
and flick upwards and you're going to
get that kind of winged effect I always
go back in afterwards just to smooth out
those edges you got to smooth out those
edges now it's time for the lid color
I'm using the waterproof cream color by
Anastasia Beverly Hills in the shade
yellow I'm just gonna apply that with a
sigma ooh cream color brush how fitting
because this is called cream color cream
color brush this parts gonna be a little
tricky I'm kind of nervous to use this
product I feel it can get really crazy
real quick so go in with caution
I'm just going to start on this outer
corner here and apply a light layer
really close to my mirror right now
because I'm trying to make sure not to
mess up my crease I'm applying a light
layer and then take the brush as if
you're applying a winged liner and flick
it up to meet the tail of the shadow
here actually think I'm going to need a
smaller angled brush real quick I'm not
trying to get caught up let's see this
one
I'm going to take the Dell iam tool
seven three six brush because it's a
little bit more dense so it's going to
give a nice hard line and I'm just going
to hug the bottom of the crease and
flick outwards
I'm actually a dipping some inglot
duraline into the pot of yellow liner
because I find that this cream color is
a little bit drying so in order to kind
of make it more fluid I use the dura
line by Inglot you guys haven't tried
that for any of your gel liners it's
amazing ooh that wings so sharp it's so
job
to set that cream color I'm going into
the radioactive melt stock this one is
the one with all the bright colors and
I'm going to take neon which is this
bright yellow and I'm going to pack that
on to the lid right over the yellow face
this reminds me of BL say should I name
this tutorial lemonade
name one other there is a little bit of
fallout
so with these shadows but I did save my
face makeup for last because I know that
when you do a more dramatic look with
brighter colors it's just safe my face
makeup last so I'm taking an angled
brush now to set the wing as well that
way we have a more precise application
with the shadow normally I would do a
winged liner with this type of eye look
but I want the focus just to be on the
yellow so I'm just gonna go straight
into mascara this is the NARS audacious
mascara just give my little baby lashes
a nice coat I forgot to tell you guys
about this eyelash curler I forgot to
put it in my favorites video and I was
so mad because I was like I know I was
missing something this eyelash curler is
the best eyelash curler ever coming from
somebody with no eyelashes like baby
lashes this actually makes it look like
I have some lashes when I wear mascara
how did he save it surat Seurat set up
set up I got it at Sephora the girl was
really nice at Sephora she told me like
you have to get this eyelash curler it's
the best I was gonna get another one but
that blew every eyelash curler that I've
ever used out of the water literally
life-changing just taking a nice light
coat of mascara on my lashes because I
have all that yellow eyeshadow fallout
on them too because we're not using a
winged liner I want to use a dramatic
lash I'm going to use House of lashes
ikonics
and try to get as close to the lash line
as possible of course if you have
trouble hiding your lash band you could
apply a thin layer of black liner just
to the lash line if you want alright so
moving on to the face and then I'll
finish off the eyes I'm using the Urban
Decay all nighter this is the waterproof
long-wear liquid foundation so I'm gonna
try this I know it does oxidize when you
apply it to the skin
so it looks a little bit light at first
but it might work for me it might not so
we'll see this is a new foundation it
looks so light compared to my skin on my
hand let's just give it a go see what
happens so this is a new foundation by
Urban Decay and it is extra matte full
coverage I don't know if it's going to
work for my color what the formula seems
really nice I'm just gonna hope that it
it oxidizes to my skintone and if not
I'll warm it up with some bronzer this
is shade o 7 so I think I might need
depending on how much it changes right
now like one or two shades darker dang I
barely used any and I feel like it's
already covered so much of my face this
is an extra matte foundation god that
was a tiny little pump and that pretty
much covered my whole face except my
forehead so I'm just going to get one
more pump out of here put this packaging
Schwing
this foundation is like crazy it
literally covers every imperfection I'm
gonna go to the mall after this looking
snatched a F I saw 10 uses as concealer
actually and it like covered so well as
concealer I bet you if I kept one of
those lighter ones it would work bomb as
a concealer you know I imagine to anyone
out there who has freckles I get that I
don't have freckles so I don't know what
it's like you know I know it's different
when you have something that other
people want but you don't necessarily
like it I love how freckles look on
people I think they're so beautiful but
you know what I've heard people say like
that they're not in love with their
freckles and if you're looking for a
foundation that would cover that or any
like discoloration even if it's not
freckles maybe if you have like acne
scars honestly this this is like
probably the most full coverage
foundation I've ever tried in my life
even more so than Estee Lauder Double
Wear which covers everything and it's
like super matte for concealer I'm going
to use the amazing cosmetics amazing
concealer and this is in the shade
medium golden I'm going to take this
concealer and just apply it to the
hollows of my eyes right here and I'm
using a morphe 27 brush for this dude
this foundation is like I can't stop
staring at it and I'm taking the Tarte
shape tape this is the new concealer
this is actually my first time trying it
I haven't yet tried it so I'm just gonna
dab that on to kind of highlight I've
heard so many good things about this
concealer somewhat tested today Katie
said she said she liked it more than the
NARS I was like I need to try that to
see if that's the same situation for me
but I don't know you guys know I love my
NARS too so I'm just going to put a
little bit on the outer edge here too to
sharpen up this wing and clean up just
in case there's any like you know
eyeshadow tends to build up over here
from the blending
I don't know if I mentioned I use the
shape tape in the shade medium now I'm
going to set my concealer using the
Laura Mercier translucent powder i just
did my Beauty Blender straight into the
powder and then apply it to the under
eyes and then down the center of the
nose alright so just let it sit for a
second and then dust it away I'm
definitely not studying the rest of my
face with this foundation because it's
so mad it literally doesn't need to be
set I'm about to go to that victorious
if your panty sales snatch basically be
done up I'm probably going to be in
sweatpants
going into this bronzer this is the s
day edit the barest bronzer with a sigma
large angled contour brush plus to the
cheekbone this bronzer is like a little
bit more warm toned it's a little bit
peachy I think I would say has a little
bit of a red undertone opposed to like
more orange undertone alright and then
for blush I'm going to be using the new
air blush this is the pink and kisses
shade by Marc Jacobs looks like this
apply it right about here and blend it
into that bronzer want to give like a
nice fresh look with this blush I
wouldn't recommend baking with this
foundation actually because it is just
so mat if you bake it like kind of sucks
you in like sucks you in dries up like
tightens the skin tightens there you go
I don't even think you need concealer
with this foundation to be honest so my
highlight I'm going to be going into the
Jacqueline Hill Becca highlighting
palette because I want to keep with the
fresh look I am going to use champagne
pop to keep with that nice like girly
blush that we applied yes girl
it's mama loves it a little bit on the
nose
I'm going to use this Fiona styles
medium dark sculpting palette I like the
colors in here because they're really
ashy they're not super warm so I like to
use these to contour my nose so I'm just
taking a little bit of that I'm just
going up sides down here and then right
here finishing off the eyes going back
into the shade rubbish this is just the
lightest Brown and I'm gonna lightly
shadow my lower lash line but not too
much because I kind of like the look of
it looking softer and a little bit more
bare originally I was gonna really smoke
out the lower lash line and make it all
crazy but I think it looks fresh without
anything too much down here so it's
gonna be a nice little shadow yeah I
like that
for the waterline I'm going to use the
color pop cream color liner and this is
in the shade punch make the sexy
waterline face and then apply some lower
lash mascara load up on the lower lash
mascara so we're done with the eye
makeup for the lips you could either go
nude which is the safe choice which you
know I really wanted to go nude but I'm
not gonna go I really wanted to go nude
that sounds bad I wanted to do nude lips
but I'm not going to I'm gonna brighten
the look up even more with like a you
know get involved I'm gonna use the LA
girl endless lip liner in the shade pink
parfait so now they're lined I'm going
to use the amore matte liquid lipstick
by Milani this is like a interesting
color it's a cross between like a pink
and a red and it's just beautiful oh
that lip color though Oh give it to me
I'm so happy I didn't go with nude I
just quickly wanted to accentuate the
yellow liner in the waterline just a
little bit so I'm going to use this neat
matrimony this is in the shade matte
Kumar place that right on the outer
corner right below the yellow now I'm
going to use my Urban Decay setting
spray wasn't that glamorous this time
around and then to really slick my baby
hairs down I'm gonna use this Eva NYC
get glossed hair serum it's going to
help with like frizzy pieces it's good
to put a lot of this serum
you want that slick back here see now
we're looking slick ooh that made my
hair look really nice okay one last
thing I want to do I'm gonna get a
little extra for my end shots I'm going
to use this a perfect liquid gold
illuminating Perfector and I take a
little bit of that everyone always says
my shoulders highlight I always use like
highlighting lotions so when I do my end
shots BAM you gotta get that glow going
