today's video is going to be a favorites
slash products I've been loving video
you guys have been asking like her what
happened to her favorites videos and I
was like I don't know yeah you guys have
been asking where my favorites video is
wet and I just kind of I don't know I
don't know what you'll say so I'm
bringing them back what are you doing
hey hey take a look look
who's that is that your little belly
dragger little bad egg oh you're cute oh
okay would you go sometimes I don't have
favorites and I don't want to just throw
out like a monthly favorite for some
reason I wasn't like absolutely loving
you have to have this product you know
some months are a little bit lighter
than others so first we're gonna talk
about the LC foundation this is created
by a makeup artist known as makeup
eyelet on instagram she is a wonderful
wonderful do I say the word wonderful
good great amazing phenomenal splendid
bomb-ass makeup artist you guys don't
follow her on instagram you should
because she does like really good makeup
she also has like really cool courses on
makeup she came out with a foundation
line I think I tried this foundation a
while back when it first came out and I
was like him whatever didn't really like
seem as full coverage to me like I
wanted it to so it looked really pretty
when it was light coverage right but I
was like I want something a little bit
more medium to full coverage and I think
that's why I didn't like pick it up on
the regular and then I talked to Kristen
Dominique here on YouTube and she said
no I ran into Lily she told me how to
apply it so you want to apply this with
a Beauty Blender I think that is how she
would like you to apply it that's how
I'm telling you to apply it it's the
best way you want to put it on with a
Beauty Blender and then if you light
light coverage boom you're done one
layer good to go but if you want that
extra um let the foundation dry apply
another layer it looks amazing you would
think that it would look cakey but this
foundation has like a totally different
texture when it dries I can't explain
what it is it has like this smooth satin
finish it's become my favorite
foundation at the moment I've been
wearing it every single day and I really
really really like this foundation just
looks so perfect I'm in the shade
natural love this foundation definitely
recommend it
next we're going to talk about the LA
girl Pro concealer I am super late to
this party I am very well aware of that
I know a lot of people use this
concealer and have been using it on
Instagram videos like contour videos
I know address your face uses these I
know makeup Shayla uses these so I'm not
going to lie I haven't been using these
for very long I just started using them
it's not like the whole month I've been
using this concealer no no no no I just
started using this and I'm so impressed
I wanted to put it in this video just
because this concealer is super
inexpensive I will put the price right
here and I feel like anything that's
amazing quality inexpensive you just
have to let somebody know this is really
good so I'm still really really getting
to know this concealer but I'm so blown
away but my first impression of it that
I'm just like I wanted to put it in this
video just so you guys know if you're
looking for a good concealer this one's
great I have the color creamy beige I
feel like I could still get a better
color I'm not really sure but I think it
looks good I'm wearing it today it says
it's a HD high definition concealer this
color has a lot of pinky undertones in
it also a corrector as well if you do
happen to have darker circles or
pigmentation under your eyes they have a
lot of different colors for every single
type of discoloration issue issue so it
has this little brush applicator you
just kind of squeeze the tube product
comes out and you know you can just
swish it on super easy to use I blend it
out with a Beauty Blender it just looks
beautiful I have this darker color -
this one is in toast I find that this is
a nice contour color I did go a little
heavy on the nose contour today possibly
a little too heavy I just I put too much
but it looks good if you put a light
amount and you want something to contour
with this would look really good on the
cheekbones as well I don't really cream
contour very often with like liquids or
anything like that but if you want to go
for more of a dewy sunny look then you
know you could just throw it on blend it
out and call it a day let's talk about
another contour slash bronzer thing that
I've been loving this is a new lorac
take me to 10 Tango is that how I say it
Tan Tango lorac take me to tant a go
it's super cute and it has four bronzers
shades in it the top two are matte and
the bottom two are slightly shimmery the
names are really cute
San Antonio San Diego Cabo San Lucas and
Santa Cruz I love the whole concept the
palette is really nice because it has
four different shades two different
finishes just in case you know you're
feeling matte one day one day you want
to be super glowy you know maybe you
want both it's all there
I personally love tan tan Diego that's
the color I'm wearing right now I also
love tan Antonio and I don't know how I
feel about ten to cruise it looks a
little ashy to me and Cabo San Lucas is
really pretty just for an overall this
is a must-have in my opinion I'm
obsessed with it I actually haven't even
really been using matte give me Sun so
I've been using this if you guys could
even believe when I tell you that that
says a lot I love this palette so next
we have the Sonia Kashuk highlighting
stick and this is in the shade sparkling
sands I would say about two months ago
Katie and I went to Target we both
picked this up I've been absolutely
loving it it's just a really beautiful
cream highlight and I personally love to
apply a cream highlighter with my finger
to the tops of the cheekbones before I
apply a powder highlighter it just it
just makes your highlighter pop a lot
more and then if you want to go on a
vacation and you want to do a little
less you can just use the highlighter
stick by itself and it keeps with that
really soft non powdery look on your
face you just have a glow really pretty
Sheen it's not super sparkly it's more
of just like a really beautiful sheen
it's like a light champagne color it's
sheer enough for darker skin tones
because it's not going to look super
opaque and like a white line you just
dab it on it's just going to give you
that nice glisten so I think it's going
to work well with a lot of different
skin tones it is very comparable to the
benefit Watts up and any other cream
highlighter I still feel like it's right
up there if not even more so than
high-end cream highlighters I feel like
this is a really really great product so
the next item is the Bobbi Brown bronze
glow highlighter this product is
absolutely stunning stunning stunning I
would recommend this product for anyone
who has a deeper skin tone I mean I'm
wearing it right now
as you guys can see for this to be like
a homerun for me I would have liked it
to be a little bit lighter does give off
like a bronzy halo in a way but if you
have a deeper skin tone like everything
about this highlighter is absolutely
like amazing the finish the sheen the
glow the sparkle is so beautiful that
you do have a deeper skin tone you're
going to want to pick this up I promise
you will not be disappointed it's
everything so this product is the inglot
duraline I've been using this for a long
time now however I don't think I've ever
actually like talked to you guys about
duraline because it just seems like such
a boring product to talk about and it
just slipped my mind
but this is such a life saver for you if
you like gel liner products gel liner
tends to be a little bit tricky to work
with for some people and it can also dry
out it cannot be as like easy to glide
across the lid depending on your lid
texture sometimes it can tug on your lid
this is going to save you you'll never
want to do a winged eyeliner with a gel
product without this ever again and all
you do is put one drop into say your
Inglot gel liner you can use it for
other gel liners as well dip your brush
into the area that's saturated with the
drop and I promise you your winged
eyeliner is just gonna like it's gonna
glide you gotta get it and the next
product was recommended to me by Shayla
makeup Shayla and it's this Nivea
enriched body lotion this seems like
such a weird thing to talk about but
honestly this Nivea lotion is is
everything it's it's like anything you
would want in a lotion I mean if
anything it could smell a little bit
better to me but it has no scent it's
just like a no scent ocean and let me
tell you the story about this body
lotion I was hanging out with Shayla and
she was glowing like really really
glowing and I thought she had some type
of body shimmer on her her her bosoms
her bosoms were like shimmering like
almost blinding me and I was like what
body shimmer is that and she goes what
are you talking about
sniffy yet and I was like this is lying
to me right now she was like no I swear
to god she started laughing she's like
it's the Nivea lotion you have to get it
and I saw her mention it on her snapchat
once but I just thought like oh whatever
it's just some boring ass lotion let me
see if it really does all of that to my
boobs like I don't know if I was
expecting it to give me like big
breasts or anything but like I wanted to
see a little sparkle it's it is it is
that amazing like it looks great your
skin just looks so shiny it just makes
such a difference in my photos in the
way my skin looks the way my skin feels
if I'm not wearing it I just feel like
lackluster I just love the way it looks
I would say it's a really really thick
lotion if you're not really into that
then you may not like it however it does
it does settle in though after a few
minutes like at first it's really really
rich but then after a few minutes it
sinks into your skin and you just look
really nice and glowy
Nivea essentially enriched body lotion
for dry to very dry skin so next thing
I'm going to talk about is the color pop
liners I think these run for like 5
bucks I'm not sure I'll put the price
right here these are absolutely the best
eyeliners I have tried for the waterline
in particular and you know it's tricky
to find a really good eyeliner that's
going to work in your waterline and not
just disappear
these have been phenomenal and I've used
all of these colors that's why I have
them here on my desk this one I'm
wearing today which is rose gold if you
can see it this one is my favorite right
now it is in the shade get paid it's
such a beautiful rose gold liner and
it's super metallic it stays in the
waterline it glides on super easily I'm
telling you this eyeliner is amazing
I also really liked Zulu this one is so
pretty for spring I've been thinking to
myself that really pops of liner are
going to be like huge this spring that's
just like what I feel inside my gut I
think this is a really nice one to pick
up they're super affordable you can wear
this with just mascara if you're having
like a more natural day if you're having
a bronzy or day like I have a really
crazy smoky eye right now and I'm
wearing it and it looks so pretty
just like when you look into someone's
eyes and you see rose gold I mean what
more could you want this is a beautiful
eye liner it stays all day super
inexpensive I love I love it I love it
all right so the next thing I have is
this nano silver ceramic tools con air
strainer so I've know I've mentioned
before in another video how much I love
cone air products and it's only because
one they're super affordable and two
they last forever and actually three
they were the best in my opinion
had a lot of strainers that cost like
$200 at friend's house cuz you know I
didn't ever buy a 200 ollar straightener
the only reason I even tried the
straightener is because Connor sent it
to me they did not pay me to say
anything about it literally was just a
gift so I decided to test it off the
other night on my hair and holy cow
this straightener is the best
straightener I have ever used in my life
so not only does this straightener heat
up super quickly when it straightens
your hair it gives it the most beautiful
like shine almost looks glossy
afterwards my hair was looking so crazy
because I slept with it wet without
brushing it my head looked like hot
ramen really is broken crazy that's the
only reason why I decided to test it to
see if it could manage my hair without
making it look dead this made it look
super smooth it straightened my hair
super quickly it's pretty it's white it
works amazing so the last product that I
want to talk to you guys about is the
dose of colors rose gold and white
brushes these brushes are so beautiful
there's a whole set of them they're
everywhere and needing to be washed and
I have two favorites that I really
really like this one is the setting
powder brush and then we have the
tapered blush brush the setting powder
brush is so nice because it's the
perfect size for this under eye pockit
if you want to throw this in your purse
you know buff out any creasing
throughout the day just really quickly
like one of these then this brush is the
tapered blush brush which I love to use
for the contour for bronzer you still
could use it for blush here too it's
actually really nice because gives you
the perfect point to wear like this will
hit just the top of the Apple and then
you could just but I use it for contour
bronzer they're just really beautiful
well-made brushes I haven't had any
problems with shedding even with the
first use sometimes you do get a little
bit of shedding and that's normal but I
haven't really had any shedding with
these at all they're really soft
synthetic so they're vegan friendly and
they're just really pretty to look at
and have on your vanity because they're
white and rose gold and who doesn't like
white and rose gold alright so that is
everything those are all the products
