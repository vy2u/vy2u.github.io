today's video is gonna be a makeup
tutorial on this bold smoky grape like
really winged out dramatic smoky eye and
I actually got inspired by a photo that
I saw on Instagram this is a makeup look
done by Abigail makeup and it's so
pretty
hers is a lot better than mine Abigail
makeup check her out on Instagram this
look hot fire and today I'm also
partnering with bare minerals to show
you guys their new bare Pro Foundation
it's like a medium to full coverage
foundation so if any of you have been
interested on how to apply powder
foundation or like the steps because I
know like concealer and powder and all
that can get kind of tricky so I will
show you guys how to do that in this
video as well so let's go ahead and get
started
so I'm going to be doing the makeup
application a little bit different today
because we are using powder foundation
I'm going to use my concealer first and
spot conceal and conceal under my eyes I
got a little bit tan over the weekend so
I think I might use this yeah I'm gonna
use bisque it's a little bit darker just
gonna put this under the eyes one time
basic has a really nice warm undertone
took a salmon color so it cancels any
darkness let me get that pimple run time
real quick to a sucker and here to stay
so blend it out I'm actually just going
to be using my Sigma 3d kabuki brush I'm
just going to Pat that in whatever is
left over my brush I'm just gonna go
over any blemishes I have over here next
I'm going to take a little bit of
translucent powder and just set the
under eyes next we're going to do our
foundation this is a new foundation by
bare minerals it's the bare Pro I would
say it like a medium to full coverage
foundation you can build it up as much
as you want and it's powder just going
to use it with the core coverage brush
this is a brush that's specially made
for this foundation I'm using the shade
camel I've used this shade before but I
may have gotten tanner recently so
hopefully this works out well that's
good it's good color still actually I
think it might be a little light I'm
going to mix it with sandalwood see what
Santa woods all about sometime
when I go to events and I want like
super full coverage I'll wear a
foundation and then I'll pack this
powder foundation on top I feel like it
would seem crazy but it's really not it
looks flawless when I first tried this
it's very comparable to the Mac Studio
Fix powder but this one feels a little
bit lighter it doesn't feel as like
heavy it feels more light and airy if
you will I'm just going to take a darker
shade of the foundation this is hazelnut
and a Smith 112 and I'm going to start
to warm up my face with it I recommend
this method of bronzing especially if
you want to cover a lot of breakouts in
these areas which I don't know why but I
tend to break out if I use bronzer it's
nice but it doesn't give me full
coverage and if I use a powder
foundation it really just covers
everything so I'm just going to do
swirling motions to get a nice soft tan
look I'm also going to take this up into
the hairline this looks so good I love
love using powder foundation to just
warm up the face just be looking face
tuned
look how tan and bronzed I look on this
side and then like flat M and then I'm
also going to use that to contour the
sides of my nose as well I just like to
take the foundation and kind of round
out the edge of the nose like that
that's where I concentrate most of the
product whatever is left over on the
brush I like to take it up the sides
that way it's like less product going up
the edge it's not as like harsh of a
line but I like I kind of like more of a
harsh little edge here next I'm going
into the Jaclyn hill palette and I'm
taking Prosecco pop by Becca cosmetics
on a sigma high cheekbone highlighter
brush I'm just going to apply that on
the tops of the cheekbones girl
so I'm just going to apply this
highlight and then a trick is even if
you have like a super matte finish on a
foundation you could keep it matte or
you could really just make it look nice
and dewy by only placing highlight in
certain areas so you still have like a
healthy glow but you're not looking you
know oily just everywhere really pack
the powder
datian around the spots where you get
oily and then you know just highlight
where you want to look dewy yeah right
poof I'm just going to go into that like
see shape there I'm also going to take
that on the Cupid's bow it's gonna look
like you have a highlight mustache for a
second but it'll blend out once we're
all done tip of the nose down the bridge
slightly so much life I'm just gonna
like lightly dab some of my chin you
know just to give me a dewy look next
we're gonna do a little blush this is
Sigma's gold little sac Coeur de Rosa
called Rosa Cordell Rosa I'm just gonna
put it in the description box because
you guys know so we're gonna place this
just like that like hug your cheek bone
or like a little hug I know it looks
crazy right now but we'll blend it out
don't worry and if you ever feel like
you may have applied too much blush not
saying that I feel that way right now
but if you do you just take your
foundation brush or your concealer brush
that you used and just go right over it
you know tell it to calm down a little
bit there we go
that's better mm-hmm I didn't realize
how potent that blush was you know I
wasn't ready I wasn't ready so you just
kind of want to blend that into the
bronzer softly into the highlight as
well just you know give it a few swirls
so that it all kind of meets together so
now that our complexion is nice and
flawless we're going to move on to the
eyes I'm gonna prime it my lids first
first and foremost this is the benefit
Air Patrol primer just going to apply a
thin layer all over the lids up to the
brow bone I'm gonna be dipping into the
nikkietutorials collaboration with Too
Faced palette and this is the power of
moogle yes and I'm going into ivy Ivy is
named after her puppy who's so freaking
cute
such a soft spot for pups this is the
wrong brush for this this step I don't
know why I try to play myself like that
take more of a fluffy flat brush I'm
going to set my brow bone it's gonna
give you a nice little highlight here
if you try to skip setting the brow bone
like sometimes I'll do that it makes
such a difference in how clean your
eyeshadow looks and how sharp everything
looks it just makes the biggest
difference don't play yourself it's
crazy because like I love doing makeup
and I love the artistry of it but as the
years go on I swear I feel so much
better with less and less makeup on I
just love to do like the least I don't
know man why does that happen so I'm
only going to take this down to the
crease I'm not going to put it on the
lid next I'm going to go into wham bam
it's this beautiful purple shade we're
going to do this a little differently
I'm gonna take this on my lower lash
line I'm just gonna build this purple
shade upwards it's kind of gonna be like
lower smoked out lashline then you want
to take an angled brush just cuz I find
an angled brush is a little bit easier
to work with and take the eyeshadow I'm
going to kind of wing it outwards like
they it and then I'm going to go into
the promiscuous shade by melt cosmetics
this is a purple shade as well but it's
like a little bit more iridescent so I'm
going to try to blend the edges with
this and see what it looks like I'm
actually switching to a blending brush
now to kind of ground that purple wing
at the bottom I'm taking wanted which is
just a black eyeshadow from the palette
and I'm taking that on the same angled
brush and we're just going to place that
on the outer half of the eye
think I'm just going to go into makeup
and chill which is this color from the
palette just a nice chocolatey Brown and
I'm going to create a little shadow
connecting a purple line into this
crease this Brown is actually really
nice because it looks like warm tone in
the pan but it's it's more cool toned
than a lot of Browns a lot of times when
I try to use a more cool toned
chocolatey Brown it comes out so red on
me but this is actually pulling more
ashy tones which I like right next we're
taking lovesick and this is also by melt
cosmetics Summa data and apply it to the
crease kind of right below where we
applied that brown shade you know just
right in here and bring it in a little
bit it's a little bit more red than
anticipated oh this is a little color I
was trying to use alright scratch that I
meant to use enigma but I just picked up
love sticks Oh enigma is a little bit
deeper
control-alt-delete that and just pack
this color on right on top place that
all over the lid as well but I like to
make sure the crease blend is good
before I get it into the lid so after
I've smoked that out with the enigma I'm
just going to pick up the same shadow
enigma and take it on a flat brush now
and just pack it on to the rest of the
lid now I'm taking my in black gel liner
and we're going to wing it out wing this
baby I'm using a shoot up zoeva winged
liner brush so you don't want to cover
this purple okay you want to just follow
the purple but not cover it
you need to code next I'm applying Lily
lashes in the shade in the shade in the
style Miami try new lashes hopefully I
don't get played all right so that's the
eyes done now let's do the final step
we're going to do the lips
this is icon and this is bareMinerals
matte lipstick it has like a cool purple
undertone this is the finished makeup
