for today's a makeup look I'll be
showing you how to get this over here I
tweeted on Twitter and I asked you guys
what you wanted to see a lot of you guys
had fall makeup looks
someone said Chawla makeup look holla
holla I think I kind of combined a few
of those looks actually because the wing
is literally at my eyebrow today I
decided ultimately to do a fall makeup
look somehow along the way it turned
into this look which isn't super fall
but it's okay I do show you how to wear
it with a dark lip but ultimately I
think this lip looks better with the
look so if you guys like what you see
then keep on watching so first I'm gonna
prep my skin and since it's been pretty
cold for California which is not really
that cold my skin's been getting super
dry so I'm gonna start by using the
Tarte pure maracuja oil and this is just
gonna moisturize my skin so for my lips
which they looked terrible I'm gonna
apply this Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream
skin protectant and I heard a lot about
this from Lisa Eldridge if you guys are
subscribed to her on YouTube she's like
a huge makeup celebrity makeup artist
and it's multi-purpose you can use this
on your lips
your face your cuticles so now it's time
for foundation and I'm gonna be using
the Mac Studio Fix fluid and NC 35 I've
been using a lot lately because it just
makes your skin look perfect like a
dwarf and I have also been loving the
zoeva 102 silk finish buffing brush
it's quickly become my new favorite
foundation brush it works well with
powder foundation and with liquid
foundation mm-hm and obviously I already
did my eyebrows off camera because they
were looking so ferocious and they're
not even they're not even distant
cousins they're like twice separated
sister-in-law of the brothers cousin
they don't look the same at all today
I'm getting I'm done tomorrow I'm gonna
use my mac mineralize skinfinish and
give me Sun as I've said a million times
this is my favorite bronzer to warm up
the skin because it's matte it gives you
that nice sunkissed glow
and I'm not contouring with this as much
as I'm just using it as a transition
shade for my contour I'm applying this
with a Tarte brush this is one of the
brushes that came with a holiday set I
think last year we want to push the
bronzer into your hairline as well so
you don't have like a line of lighter
skin and then bronzer and then lighter
skin so I just kind of push it up into
the hairline I'm gonna contour my face
and I'm gonna use the Anastacio contour
kit a good alternative to this would be
the city color contour kit which I also
really really like and I'm gonna use
this with my favorite contour brush
which is the morphe Envy 30 I was gonna
do my concealer later but I guess I'm
just gonna do it now changed my mind so
I'm gonna use the radiant creamy
concealer by NARS I'm actually in the
market for a new concealer this one's
nice but oh no I'm kind of over it I
want something better I want something
that's light coverage that doesn't
crease set my under eyes I'm going to
use this Laura Laura is it Laura Mercier
or look Laura Laura Laura Mercier Laura
Mercier crispy now what I am near to the
a Laura Mercier invisible loose setting
powder this pot are supposed to blur how
fine lines
but it does that for me I'm just using a
laura mercier little fan brush and for
my highlighter I'm really excited I'm
going to use this for the first time
it's the dose of colors baked
highlighter in peach glow I'm gonna use
that tart brush that I've been using
just that's so pretty so for the eyes
I'm gonna prime them with my Mac soft
ochre paint pop so I'm gonna I'm gonna
apply a bone eyes shadow color this is
called Blanc by Anastacio Beverly Hills
oh I'm gonna be using and I just decided
this it cosmetics naturally pretty
palette and there's a really pretty
color in here it's this sunset shade I
think I'm gonna put it on the outer V of
my eye
so I'm concentrating most of the
eyeshadow along where I would put a
winged liner now that I have the shape
that I want I'm gonna take this
eyeshadow called deep plum by Anastacio
Beverly Hills then I run it along this
lower area and wing it out as if it was
my wings liner now it's time for the
winged liner and the tricky part for me
is keeping the wing
thin along the eye I always end up
making it thicker so hopefully it turns
out that way but if it doesn't then it
doesn't so I'm gonna start off with the
outer portion over here first and I'm
just outlining the shadow that we put
down as a guide and then what I like to
do is just kind of go along the lash
line here so there's no gaps in between
our liner and are laid slowly working
that into the inner part of my eye it's
getting thicker already always do that
what else I'm gonna fix that right now
I'm just gonna use my NYC liquid liner
and go over it just a little bit easier
see I went a little too thick I pretty
much covered all the brown that I've put
down so I went thicker like I knew I
would but that's okay you guys can have
the power in you to keep it thin and
keep it thin if not then you know you
end up like this which is fine as you
guys can see I just brought the liner
all the way down into the inner corner
and made a little point here and that's
gonna give you that cat-like shape I
made the eyeliner gods be with me on the
second eye so now I'm gonna take a
little bit of that gel liner and I'm
gonna also run it on my waterline I'm
just connecting the wing from the top to
the bottom
back into that sunset shade right here
and smoke out that line okay now we're
going to put on a little bit of mascara
and I'm using my I go black magic
mascara I mean it's not making them
longer cuz I don't have long eyelashes
but I like the formula of it back to the
original my iconic this is my last pair
I was being really stingy just trying to
use another pair so I wouldn't use these
but it's fine
house of lashes don't fail me now okay
I'm gonna take my NYC liquid liner and
just cover the eyelash band
oh let's see what we're gonna do now I
was gonna apply bottom eyelashes but I'm
second-guessing myself now cuz I did so
poorly on the top eyelashes today I
don't even know what these are but they
are
let's lash out there called ruin you
want to pop them under the lashes okay
okay so I'm gonna start off by lining my
lips with the LA girl long-lasting
all-day wear lip liner semi-permanent
autocorrect ernie's this lipstick it's
by gallon II and it's called it's in the
shade deep three
so now that we've applied that lipstick
I'm gonna go ahead and put over top of
that this jcat wonder lip paint this is
a super pigmented lip
Oh oh wait I forgot my blush actually so
I'm gonna go ahead and apply some not so
for blush I've been using my current
favorite is the Illamasqua excite and
this is has like a really orange
undertone but it kind of just gives you
like a warm feel to your face it's like
an extension of bronzer but it's a
little bit more peachy okay so this is
the look with a dark lip now I'm gonna
give you guys an alternative lip color
because I kind of feel like with the
peachy tones I want to also give like a
really nice Orange II peachy lip tone so
I'll show you guys what that looks like
right now okay so for an alternative lip
I'm gonna just go ahead and apply this
lime crime lipstick in Cosmo pump it
reminds me of like creamsicles
right like a creamsicle popsicle thing
all right so now we have this really
pretty like creamsicle orange color and
I think it kind of goes better with
these like warm peachy tones so the last
step in the look is make it bless it yep
the last step of the makeup look is
setting your makeup oh I actually got
this makeup setting spray from my Lamba
rogue
underground makeup sealant before it
melts away spray so we'll see how this
works but it's supposed to steal your
makeup in place
oh those aggressive okay
mm it's a little so now that we set our
makeup that was last step and our look
is complete this is what turned out it
was going towards fall but then you know
I was fighting it so then I changed it
with this lip and it kind of made it
more I don't know I'm just not as
fallish but it's okay
not us fall anymore but I still think
it's really appropriate for even
Thanksgiving coming up I don't know it's
kind of like orange II like Turkey's I
don't know if turkeys are orange I hope
you guys like the makeup look and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye
look you can't even see these
well I did go heavy on my bronzer I got
a missed call from you yeah don't think
okay no picture please no future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
