for today's video we're going to do this
look here it's super easy effortless
look but still bold with the lip I'll
also show you a few other lip options
throughout the video
I'm not wearing false eyelashes today so
that's a big deal for me I've actually
never done a tutorial where I do wear
false eyelashes fact anyways if you guys
are interested in this look then go
ahead and keep on watching so to start
this look off we're going to use a
primer of course that way our makeup
lasts all night this one is by makeup
forever
I love these new primers they came out
with next I'm going to use my Anastasia
brow gel and this is just a clear brow
gel it's going to keep all your hairs
down in place so you don't have any
crazy brow hairs going all over the
place and I'm also going to use her brow
Wiz in the shade caramel to lightly fill
them in brows look in fleek ish then I'm
going to go into my luminous silk
foundation by Giorgio Armani this has
been my favorite foundation lately
because it's so luminous obviously
that's what it's called and I'm buffing
that in with a buffer brush
I actually prefer using it with a Beauty
Blender now I think it gives you a more
natural finish and I'm going into my
studio fix concealer by Mac and I'm
going to apply this under the eyes just
to hide any dark circles to set my under
eyes I'm not going to use a really
bright powder because I want it to look
more natural so I'm using this setting
powder by Mac it's in the shade peach so
it's going to cancel out any dark
circles that you may have and then to
warm up my face surprise-surprise I'm
using Mac give me Sun I just love this
bronzer I think it'll forever be my
favorite just so warm and beautiful and
it looks like Sun so I love it and then
I'm gonna contour with my contour kit
I'm going to lightly contour I'm not
going to go too crazy but just chisel
out the cheekbones just slightly this is
a zoeva brush here it's a highlight
zoeva brush
going into my mineralized skinfinish by
Mac I'm going to apply that to give a
nice glow right over top and then I'm
going into my pro sculpting duo by
Makeup Forever and this is the one
actually this is number two pro
sculpting duo and I'm going to apply
that as my highlight then to give a nice
glow to our cheeks I'm going to use this
Pandora's makeup box blush and this is
in the shade pink carnation just going
to make us look nice and alive and then
to really make our face glow I'm going
to go ahead and spray a little fix+ by
Mac basically I just bathe in theirs
shower myself in it like my husband
likes to take a bath basically you want
to use a waterproof eye base so that
your eyeshadow stays this one is by mica
beauty and it's a really good eye primer
especially if you out by the pool I'm
just going to buff a light layer of that
all over the lids and then I'm going
into my the balm new dude eyes shadow
this is in the shade fit and I'm just
going to lightly dust that over the
entire lid with a loose fluffy brush
first just to give a nice wash and you
can actually use these eyeshadows wet or
dry so I'm spraying a little fix+ and
just highlighting the center of my lid
it's going to be a little bit more oily
looking in that area now now take a non
clumping mascara this one is my essence
and it's called last lash princess
Volume Mascara I'm just going to apply a
light coat of this to my lashes so I
wanted to show you guys three different
lip colors with this the first one is
NYX soft matte lip cream in Buenos Ida's
this is a really long-lasting formula
and it just gives you a nice subtle
peachy look the next one is from gallon
II and this is in the shade petal and
this one's really nice because it's
super hydrating and the last option is a
liquid lipstick which is nice because if
you want the appearance of a bold lip
but you don't want to worry about
smudging it this is a good option
because it does not smudge this one is
by anastacio Beverly Hills and the lip
liner is Mac Ruby woo so I'm just going
to line my lips first with that and then
apply the liquid lipstick
and then to add volume to your hair just
to get like that really nice messy look
I'm going to apply some dry shampoo this
one is like chlorine you just want to
rub that in your roots
I mean spray it in your roots and then
rub it around so it absorbs any oil you
have and then to add even more fullness
I'm using this Redken windblown dry
finishing spray and you're done alright
guys so that is it for this tutorial
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you loved it do not worry the winged
liner will be back soon I promise you
guys I'm just really enjoying these
effortless glowy look slightly with the
heat going on in Southern California so
I really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video and I'll see you guys next time
