for today's makeup look I'm going to be
doing this really beautiful purple
spotlight smokey eye and I'm really
excited because I used all affordable
eyeshadows which I know you guys have
been asking for this is the city color
color basics palette now let's go ahead
and get started I'm going to go in to
this peachy shade and apply it into the
crease with a blending brush you guys
know I love to apply a transition shade
first then I'm taking this really
beautiful cranberry shade and I'm going
to apply this to the outer portion of my
eye run it through the crease and then
also apply it to the inner portion of my
eye creating what I like to call a
sandwich effect keeping the center clear
of shadow now I'm going into this deep
matte purple shade this palette does
have mattes and shimmers so I'm going to
take the matte color and apply that to
the crease and I'm keeping the eye shape
really round with this color and as you
guys can see I'm taking it all the way
to the inner corner of my eye as well
and then in between each step I like to
take a clean blending brush and really
diffuse the edges with no product on it
just so everything looks nice and
blended and then if you want to go in
with more product after you definitely
can like I'm doing here I realized I
wanted to deepen up the eye a little bit
more with that purple now to really
intensify I'm going in with this matte
black shadow and just applying it really
where we put the purple shade as well
and I'm also going to take this matte
black and apply it to the outer portion
of my eye
and inner corner of my eye like I did in
the beginning just to really deepen up
and intensify the look I really like
these eyeshadows because they were super
easy to blend
so I actually mixed some of the black
eyeshadow with that matte purple as well
just to keep the look mostly purple I
don't want the crease to look black I
want it to look really dark purple so I
mix those two together and now I'm going
to go into this really beautiful shade
it's a very very nice shimmer it almost
looks silver but I think it's mostly
white and I dampened my brush first
before I dipped it into the shadow to
really make the eyeshadow look metallic
and it's going to make it pop so I'm
concentrating most of the eyeshadow in
the center of the eye and then diffusing
what's left over into the dark colors
that we put down just to make sure that
the edges where the white meets the dark
colors that we put down weren't so harsh
I grabbed a little bit of that cranberry
shade that we used earlier and lightly
diffused out those edges just a bit so
now go ahead and take a black liner and
just line your waterline and you're also
going to take this right under your lash
line and then I like to set it with a
black eye shadow just to make sure that
it doesn't budge and to really smoke out
that block make it a little bit softer
and more sultry I'm using that cranberry
shade one more time and just running it
under the eyes so I know this is hard to
believe but I'm totally skipping the
wind liner today and I'm going to go
straight in with mascara in my favorite
eye lashes just because I want to keep
the look a little bit softer
eyelashes on biome so now I'm going to
go towards this peachy blush because I
gravitate towards everything peachy you
guys know this I'm just going to apply
it to the apples of my cheeks and do a
little dance to some rap songs
apparently I want to keep the eyes the
focus of this look so I'm just going to
apply a nude lip with this you guys to
choose a bolder lip if you'd like but I
wanted to keep it a little bit softer
and that's the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video give it
a thumbs up if you did if you're
interested in the palette check the

I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
