today's video is going to be on this
pinky purple smokey eye so I thought it
would be fitting for prom or if you're
not anywhere in the realm of high school
like me you could wear this to any other
event the reason I chose to do this look
is because I myself for prom wore a pink
and purple smokey eye I remember going
to Mac my dad took me to match again my
makeup done looking back I'm not sure if
it was great but like at the time I was
like bitch I'm slaying this makeup look
he looked at me after and was just like
my dad loves me looking natural with
like no makeup knowing how he is I could
tell he was like that's a lot of makeup
but I loved it the spirit of that I
thought I would do a purple and pink
smokey eye for you guys so if you're
interested in this makeup look keep on
watching so the night before prom it's
always good to do a nice face mask this
one is by jerel Parker and it's the
fango face mask this one's going to be
good for moisturizing and leaving your
skin looking nice and rejuvenated and
it's just a mud therapy mask gonna be
nice to give yourself like a little
at-home spa the night before you can
also use an overnight hair treatment
that's going to repair your damaged hair
this one is by Brio Gio and it's the
don't despair repair gel - oil
it smells really good the first thing
I'm going to do is apply my eyeshadow
base this one is by benefit and it's the
air patrol eyes shadow base just buff
this all over the lid next I'm going to
go ahead and highlight my brow bone and
also take that down into the crease area
of the eye that way it makes it easier
for us to blend all the eyeshadows that
we put on top of the crease so next
going into this purple shadow this is by
ardency in and it's in the shade royal
I'm going to go ahead and put this on
the inner corner and the outer corner of
the eye and you want to really create a
sandwich effect with this eye shadow is
what I like to call it using a sigma
firm shader a 57 brush for this
so the next thing you want to do is just
take a blending brush and buff out those
edges and start to really soften
everything and create the shape on the
outer V i'm using a sigma small tapered
blending brush
so you just want to keep packing on
color after you blend because you do
blend away some of the intensity pack it
all next you want to blend out the
crease and I'm going to use this hot
pink shade this is from the two-faced
bonbon palette and it's called totally
fetch you're just going to sweep that
along the crease right above where we
placed that purple now I'm going to take
this lab just blending in brush this is
called the lab squared and this is going
to give us a really nice blend so I'm
just going to really just blend all of
these colors together so I kind of did
this eye a little bit different but I
didn't really like how it turned it out
this glittery part so I'm going to try
something different on this eye and then
if I like it better I'll just fix this
one I'm going to use the color pops
super shock shadow and this is in the
color dare put that in the center of the
deed why isn't this eye shadow like
cooperating with me or no it's like not
coming off did I do something to
passagio to upset it next I'm going to
pick up this purple liner this is one of
the new liners for makeup forever it's
the aqua XL eyepencil and this is in the
 you know makeup forever in their
names always play in me man
always like a bunch of numbers a number
one - 90 so purple liner we're just
going to go ahead and apply that usually
I like to do my lash line after my
concealer but because we're going to
apply glitter I'm just going to go in
cuz the glitter will fall over my all
over my face I'm going to take this in
the outer also in the waterline and in
the inner part as well and then right in
the center I'm just going to take this
lighter shade for makeup forever and
this one is shade M - 90 - and I'm going
to place this in the center of the
waterline and also the lash line can we
take a pencil brush and just try to buff
those edges out a little bit
all right so next I want to pick up a
little bit of a glitter this is from NYX
and it's in the shade violet and I'm
just using a little bit of glitter glue
with this I'm just going to Pat that
onto the lid in the center you want to
like kind of tap it because it's going
to make it stickier I started adding
some NYX liquid glitter and this is
crystal pink kind of already added it so
I'm just adding it just to the bottom
here I'm also going to take a little bit
of that where we put the pastel so now
I'm going to pick up this shadow by Mac
this is beautiful iris this used to be
one of my favorite colors so I'm just
going to go ahead and pop some of this
in the inner corner of my eyes the next
you want to take a pigmented long-wear
liner for the inner upper rim waterline
so that you could tight line sometimes I
have a brain fart so you want to tight
line the inside of your eye with a
really nice long wearing black liner
just to make sure you get all the empty
spaces between the lashes this one is my
star looks and it's their luxe long wear
eye pencil in the color jet next I'm
going to go ahead and pry my lashes and
I'm going to be trying out the they're
real tinted primer from benefit and this
came in my Ipsy glam bag this month so
let's give it a shot says it is
water-resistant it Prime's the lashes so
that you have a nice feathery look to
the lashes I already primed my face
using the NYX pore filler I actually
really really love the primer going to
go ahead and apply my foundation this
one is by l-c it's in the shade natural
she also came out with the LC glow
enhancer a dry face oil this is really
good for anyone who has extra dry skin
or if you want like a dewy glow see I
don't have extra skin but I tried this
the other day and my face looked very
tell me Steven what did it look like JLo
glow be careful though because you don't
want to use too many pumps I made that
mistake the first time I think like one
or two is good especially if you don't
have dry skin
just going to take a few pumps of this
and you can apply this oil to your face
before our foundation or you could just
go ahead and mix it in I'm just going to
mix in like one and a tiny drop mix it
all together just going to go ahead tan
up my face a little bit this is a pretty
good match to my neck I'm going to be
using the NARS concealer in the shade
ginger this one is a little bit closer
to my skin tone so I'm going to go ahead
and apply it first just go ahead and
blend that out with my Beauty Blender so
this is why we got to do the eye shadow
after the concealer then it starts to
get in the way over here next I'm going
to take my Laura Mercier setting powder
this is my favorite setting powder I'm
just going to use that to set the
concealer on my under eyes I also like
to put it along the sides of my nose
where I place the concealer so I'm gonna
go ahead and finish the eyes off and I'm
just going to take the same hot pink
color that we use to blend out the
crease and I'm going to use that to
blend out my lower lash line I'm just
taking that on a small pencil brush and
I'm just going to buff out the purple
edges and make it a little bit more
smoky as you guys know when I have like
a more dramatic look or more natural
look or any look I loved ikonics by
house of lashes and I'm going to keep
them closer to the outer part of my eye
Oh too far scale it back so I apply
these coming from the top so that they
stick up more so that they're a little
bit more letteri
since I'm kind of breaking out in this
area right over here I'm going to use my
Mac Studio Fix powder this is an NC 45
darker than my skin tone and it's like
full coverage so sometimes I like to use
this powder to contour and it also gives
good coverage so that's a tip if you
have breakouts in this area or even if
you just want more coverage could use a
studio fix as a bronzer oh and I'm using
one of the new DOS brushes this is the
angled contour brush to contour a little
bit more I'm going to be using this
lorac take me to tengo tengo tentei go
and to go take me to tan to go and I'm
going to be using
tan antonio and tan diego it's cute i'm
just going to put this on the outer
parts of the jawline i mean i already
really contoured with that mac powder
but you know just go in the extra mile
to highlight i'm going to be using this
city color highlight trio little palette
has a three pretty pigmented
highlighters to apply that one to be
using this crown a stippling brush this
is good for foundation and cream
products as well but i also like because
it does have these little duo fiber tips
you can apply just a little amount of
product
it's like dusts it very lightly i'm just
gonna apply that to the tops of the
cheekbones I've always really loved the
city color trios i used to use it all
the time i feel like it's a really good
affordable highlighter it's not like
super glittery it's just so glowy do you
see that season john face i'm also going
to apply that to the Cupid's bow i feel
like i do this in every video tip in the
nose same different day those
little intense know i have a highlight
mustache you can go from like Cupid's
bow highlight to highlight mustache
really quickly i do it all the time i
think it's still there but you know what
then i'm gonna go ahead and apply some
blush this one is by mac and it's in the
shade Melba when you use the same NARS
brush that I used earlier this is a
really subtle blush it's just nice when
you want just a little flush of color
but nothing too overpowering I love this
blush I feel like it goes good with any
makeup look somehow it just does
for the lips I wanted to use a color
that was not nude something that had
some purple undertones but also not too
loud so I thought this color would be
nice we'll see how it goes this is in
the shade dopey and it's the colour-pop
ultra satin so it's not super matte I've
actually never tried these is my first
time trying it so just gonna apply it
straight from the tube and I'm not gonna
use a lip liner I like this color
because it has a lilac undertone so I
feel like it's going to go really good
with the look I really like this formula
it's very soft I haven't worn these
throughout the day yet but the the paper
did say that they're not like the super
matte liquid lipsticks that don't
transfer they do have some transfer but
they're supposed to be long wearing

tutorial I really hope that you enjoy
