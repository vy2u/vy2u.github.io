today we're going to do a purple smoky
eye which my channel is definitely
lacking we're going to start off by
applying Urban Decay's a primer potion
in the shade Eden and I really like this
shade in particular because it's really
light so it's going to make all of the
vibrant colors pop then I'm going to go
in with this color which is called
Woodstock and I'm just taking a large
fluffy brush and running that through
the crease giving my eye a really nice
purple haze now I'm picking up this
shade in the color free-love and I'm
going to pack that on to the lid with a
flat shader brush I'm going to take this
beautiful iridescent purple shade and
I'm going to apply that to the outer
corners and I'm just going to give it a
nice little round shape with a fluffy
brush now I'm going to go ahead and pick
up busted and this is from The Naked 2
palette and I'm gonna just target this
right in the socket of the eye just to
give the look a little bit more depth
because right now it's just a light
purple haze and I want to kind of ground
the look a little bit and since we're
blending so many colors together I
always like to take a clean fluffy brush
and just kind of blend out any edges
just so it stays really soft
after blending I felt like I lost a
little bit of the intensity so I'm just
adding a little bit more of the darker
shade to the outer seed now I'm going to
take this liner in the color Ranson and
I think this color may be discontinued
but asphyxia or psychedelic sister are
very close I took that liner pretty far
down because I want to create a really
smoky under-eye so I'm just going to go
in with that light purple that we used
earlier and smoke that liner out to tie
in the crease a little bit I went back
into the color Woodstock and I'm going
to apply that just to the outer lower
lash line and I feel like it gave a
really pretty watercolor effect to the
shadows I really like it now I'm taking
booty-call from the Naked 2 palette and
applying that in the tear duct as a
highlight before I apply mascara I'm
going to go ahead and prime my lashes
using subversion time for mascara this
is Urban Decay's new mascara called
perversion and this mascara is intensely
black and it does not smudge especially
for those of you who apply a lot of
mascara to your lower lashes to add a
little bit more drama to the look I'm
applying these false lashes and the
style bait and then just to make sure
that they are well blended with my
natural lashes I take one last coat of
mascara just to kind of stick those two
things together so now that the eyes are
done apply a peachy blush to your cheeks
and then I'm taking this highlighter
here and applying it to the tops of my
cheekbones
since the eyes are the standout of this
look I'm just going to take a nude lip
pencil and this is in the color naked
and I'm going to apply that to the lips
just kind of as a lipstick because I
want it to be super subtle and super
matte and that completes the look I hope
