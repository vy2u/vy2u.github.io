ki-sun glass and she could take you
stop
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today's video is so exciting for me
because I will finally be getting to
show you my sunnies in collaboration
with key Australia a while back I did a
video doing my sunglass collection and I
used a lot of key Australia Sony's I'm a
huge fan I've been a fan since I laid
eyes on a pair of key sunglasses and
looking back at that video and seeing
now that I have my own sunglasses in
collaboration with them to show you guys
is really really exciting for me and huh
so excited to finally be able to show
you guys all the sunglasses because I
was only allowed to tease one pair I
can't wait to show you guys the hot fire
that I got right and I also wanted to
thank you guys so much for all the
support I've been getting on this
sunglass collaboration this is the first
time I'm putting something with my name
on it and I'm really nervous and excited
not nervous in a bad way just nervous
and like a kind of just butterflies type
of way because I've been working on
these sunglasses and I'm just it's
always so exciting and nerve-wracking to
show something that you're so excited
and passionate about to other people so
I can't wait to show you guys sunglasses
so let's just go ahead and look at them
because I'm just talking too much
because I'm really excited first of all
this is the pouch I want it to be simple
sleek black pouch and gold lettering
down here that says key and desi Perkins
super cute super chic cheeky beating all
the sunglasses come with this case
alright I'm like which one should I show
first I'm gonna start off with what
you've already seen because you know
gotta put those in there you guys are
very familiar already with high p high
key is a oversized aviator with a flat
lens this is high key in gold I would
say it's little rose gold with a gold
trim this is all gold and then the lens
is like a somewhat rose gold color ooh
these are oversized so I knew that I had
to have an aviator give it to me
give it to me if I had to choose a pair
of sunglasses to wear for the rest of my
life they would be aviators I always am
drawn to them every new pair that comes
out
I always need I'm like obsessed with
them and then I also added this little
detail these little triangle
they're like little gold triangle prongs
that come on the side of the lens and
then also on the bottom just to add a
little detail I love this pair I feel
like they're going to be so good for
summer especially when you have that JLo
glow going just like a lot of
highlighter nude glossy lips these are
going to be hot fire size wise these are
oversized aviators they are a fairly
large if you have the Vivien's or you
have seen the Vivien's bikie they are
similar in size to that so that gives
you like a reference point as to how big
these aviators are I'm personally a fan
of oversized sunglasses because I think
it's like really chic I say chic a lot
but you know the first thing that comes
to my mind is mary-kate and Ashley Olsen
because I love even though they have
smaller faces like they always rocked
oversized sunglasses and I really like
that look these are a little bit more
showstopper when I've worn these I've
got people asking me like what
sunglasses they are it's kind of a cool
feeling for people to ask that and be
like oh well actually next we have high
key in black and this is really like my
go-to everyday type of sunglass I just
feel like it matches every single outfit
I could wear literally like just black
workout clothes and when I put these on
I feel instantly a little bit more
fashionable and presentable and it's
just an accessory that is going to make
you look effortlessly cool I love that
the lens is reflective but it's not
super loud it's a little bit more toned
down pending on where you're looking
they will be a little bit more
reflective so they can be really
reflective or sometimes they can look a
little bit more toned down that's really
what I like about these Stephen actually
loves this pair they look really really
good on him honey oh never mind when
he's busy he looks really good in these
sunglasses as well he actually loves
them these also have the same detail as
the gold
are the exact same but the prongs are
black just like the arms of the
sunglasses and there's really not much
to say besides these are hot fire these
are have our thank you so much
so now we're going to move on to the
pair number two this pair I'm really
excited to show you guys because you
guys really helped me name this pair of
sunglasses I named them tym thank you so
much I always say that and I took a
Twitter poll and literally all of you
guys or saying to you is M T WA s M so
this pair is only close to me because
it's kind of like symbolizes the
relationship that I've had with
everybody on snapchat and Twitter and
everyone who supports me who knows that
I say thank you so much all the time and
okay I'm just going to show it to you
guys these are T y sm e KO dusim so
these are t ys m they are matte black
they have a more fun edgy like cool girl
type of vibe I kind of wanted to create
a sunglass for every girl so the aviator
the more funky pair like this is a
little bit more retro and then I'll show
you the other pairs too but this pair
was highly inspired by the Vesper
because honestly it's just like it was
one of my favorite pairs and I wanted
something that had just like a really
crazy retro vibe and I just hope that
you guys love it because I love this so
much I love the mint lens it does have a
mint lens these aren't flat lens they
are regular and then this is matte black
and it's super sharp and super pointy
and it's just so much fun I absolutely
love this pair of sunglasses I love the
idea of making the sunglasses frameless
halfway through just to make it a little
bit more fun pairs really close to me
because it has a lot to do with my
connection with you guys so it's why I'm
even more excited to show you and why I
didn't want to sneak preview these
because I wanted to talk to you guys
about them more in like a personal level
I gave them a mint lens because mint is
such a beautiful color and I absolutely
fell in love with some of the mint
lenses that key has I knew that I wanted
that beautiful color this is so fun for
summer I imagine these sunglasses on
I've always imagined them on crispy I
cause I just love when she has those red
vibes you guys know when she does her
old Hollywood hair and she just has the
most amazing lips and when she has them
red Oh like I die for some reason these
when I pictured all my sunglasses on my
friends I pictured these on her and I
think they're just going to be such a
fun pair for summer Oh like imagine
these with a bold bright lip everything
everything yeah these are tym these are
a huge tribute to you guys and really me
saying thank you so much to you guys I'm
getting a little emotional here who knew
sunglasses would make you feel so some
type of way so for the last frame I
really wanted to do something that
wasn't a reflective lens because I know
not everyone loves reflective lenses and
I didn't want to you know exclude
anybody I wanted to make sure that I got
something for as many people was like
good with three pairs so this is on the
low yes girl oh these are on the lows I
love how like simple boxy and chic these
look I say chic with every pair like I
really wanted all of them to be chic
released so they're all chic they're
just different styles literally across
the board totally different love the
straight across and I want it to be a
mixture of feminine but also hard so
this whole shape is so like boxy the
finish of the matte frame then the
really really dark dark lens which I
love because you can't see if you're
wearing makeup or not that in mixture
with the gold feminine arm of the
sunglasses I feel like I just love
mixing really girly and really tomboyish
in one I just feel like it makes a
unique mixture I just picture myself
wearing these on the way to the airport
you know what I mean just like Oh
getting my ID oh here you go
oh my ticket I pictured these on Katie
all the time because I love the way they
look the gold in the black with her
platinum hair I feel like she really
rocks the boxy
shape of sunglasses I love all of them I
don't know which one's my favorite pair
because I designed these for every
single different mood I have you know
what I'm saying those were all the
sunglasses I'm so happy and excited to
be able to share them with you finally
