today's video is gonna be a makeup
tutorial on this look I wore this in my
last favorites video and you guys all
really wanted to see a tutorial I really
love this makeup look because it's so
easy it's a good look for beginners it
doesn't require a lot of products and
what I love about the eye look is that
you can interchange the lips to really
any lip color if you want to do
something a little bit more evening you
could do a bold lip a red lip a vampy
lip the world is your oyster so if you
guys are interested in this makeup look
then keep on watching
alright so the first thing I'm doing is
priming my lids and I'm using this Mac
prep and prime then we take a blending
brush and make sure it gets all over the
lid and the crease evenly because if you
don't even it out your eyeshadow is
gonna look patchy nobody likes that this
look is super easy and then we're gonna
quickly set the base with a bone colored
shadow or you can use translucent powder
this is Blanc type by Mac which I heard
they're discontinuing I don't know why
this is one of my favorite eyeshadow
okay discontinued favorite eyeshadow oh
my god it just fell and broke everywhere
well there's that no worries not like
it's a never coming back into my life
again I'm using the shards of shadow
that have crashed all over my heart now
I'm just gonna be mourning the eyeshadow
this whole time so I'm going to use that
to set the brow bone and the crease but
leave the lid free of any shadow because
the look is all matte I don't want to
set the lid since I'll be using a matte
color just might look a little funky for
this look we're going to be using the
Suva Beauty palette and this is the
neutral necessity palette so we're going
to be using basically just these two
colors this color here which is
night market and this one which is
hookah so just those to call our super
easy look so I'm going to be applying
the first shade with the Smith two for
seven the Smith blending brushes are
absolutely everything in life
you guys haven't tried them they're
great I'm going to be picking up the
lighter brown of the shades we're just
going to start placing that into the
crease I like to start off with a little
eye shadow of course and build it up
this look is super easy I know a lot of
the tutorials I do can be a little bit
like complicated with like glitter liner
and stuff like that so this is a really
easy makeup look good for beginners so
you just want to apply a light wash of
this color into the crease and almost
blend it like so it fades into nothing
up here and bring it out it's okay if
you get it onto your lid because we're
going to actually pack the whole lid
with this light brown color as well this
is honestly the best makeup look if
you're in a rush and you just want to
like look like you're on and poppin
without putting a lot of effort or using
a lot of eyeshadows for my brows today
I've been using the it cosmetics
universal taupe brow pencil and I've
really been liking it it's actually been
my most picked up brow product lately so
see how I'm blending this this crease
just so softly so that it kind of just
slowly fades into the blog type I shadow
that we place there it's no harsh lines
just almost like a smoke around the eyes
that's what you want and whatever's left
over it that's when you take it towards
the outer part of the eye here you never
want to come in strong with a lot of eye
shadow and blend this way just like you
want to take the least amount of product
and blend up here you also want to do
that on this outer corner so it just
slowly Grady eights out into like a thin
smoke of shadow now I'm going to take a
flat brush this one has no name on it so
I don't know where it's from and pick up
the same Brown that we used in the
crease and we're going to pack that on
all over the lid this is such a pretty
Brown it's like my new favorite brown
eyeshadow this eyeshadow will probably
look so good on any eye shade but
especially green
because it is warm and it'll make green
eyes pop when using matte eyeshadows I
really like to pack on one layer and
then go in and pack on another layer
because unlike foiled eyeshadows matte
ones sometimes I get a little patchy
this one didn't but I also use this
method of just making sure to pack on a
lot of product so next we're going to
take the darker brown shadow in the
palette and I'm picking this up using
Adele iam tools 7 7 2 brush we're just
going to pack it on onto the outer V
right now I'm going to take a clean ish
blending brush now that we have the
color placed I'm going to blend out the
edges you always want to do the heavy
blending of the edges with a clean
blending brush that's key always key so
that your eyeshadow doesn't look super
crazy before finishing off the eye
makeup which is the lower lashline and
lashes I like to do my face makeup that
way when I do my under eye concealer it
doesn't interfere with the lower lash
line blending I'm going to be using the
adultery in Gabbana this is the perfect
matte liquid foundation in the shade
bronze 1/4 for this foundation says it's
matte however I don't think it is that
matte to be honest with you it has more
of a satin finish for me can see my face
is really pale but my neck is a little
bit more tan so I'm going to try to
match it to my neck which is perfect I
know when I first used this foundation
it had a really really like dewy finish
for me I felt like so I have to set it
with powder I wouldn't say it's matte in
my opinion but I like this foundation
because I feel like it's like a
lightweight so a tip when you're
applying your foundation if you tend to
get a lot of build-up around your
nostrils of foundation throughout the
day or like your laugh lines it's good
to start applying your foundation on the
outer perimeters of your face and then
slowly working the product towards the
center that way you focus less of the
product in the center and it still
covers it's just you don't put the
majority of the product there I would
typically bring this like all the way
down my neck
but you know I ain't going anywhere
after this video I'm going to sleep so
I'm not trying to wake my Dolce and
Gabanna alright so for my concealer I'm
just gonna apply ginger by NARS this is
the creamy concealer right here in the
hollows of the eyes because it has a
little bit more warmth to it so cancels
out those hollow shadows for the rest of
the concealer I'm going to be using the
Urban Decay Naked skin this is the shade
medium nutrient just make my nose look
slimmer by putting the concealer there
let's just put this concealer everywhere
really sharpen up these edges here blend
it using the Beauty Blender
so you don't have to worry too much
about the edges of your shadow because
then you could just cut it with the
concealer make it look extra Chad once
you like cut the concealer here you turn
the beauty blender around to the
foundation side and you want to blend
out this line here so you don't have
like a sharp concealer line there and I
also like to blend the edges of the
concealer with the foundation side as
well now it looks nice and clean
alright I'm also going to take that
urban decay concealer and highlight the
nose to make it look slimmer and
straighter I always try to make a
straight line down by nose and I can
only hope for the best cuz it goes left
sometimes take it up to the forehead and
then the Cupid's bow and a little bit on
the chin in the blend it out alright
we're looking good we're looking fresh
before I go in and set that concealer
I'm going to contour my nose out a
little bit with this la girl Pro
concealer in the shade toast I'm like
not that good at contouring my nose I
feel like I love Sarah he is like
amazing at contouring her nose I love
how her nose contour looks I need her to
hook me up one day just a light contour
and just the tip you sick individuals in
this room right now especially you do
need going to go ahead and set my under
eyes with my Laura Mercier translucent
powder I'm gonna bake it if you tend to
get really oily on the sides of your
nose I do I like to definitely put the
powder there and bake it it just gets
less oily sometimes I'm not able to bake
under my eyes my under eyes are really
dry baking looks terrible on me but
right now it's been going OK for me so
and put some here and also just down the
nose wait a couple minutes and then go
ahead and take a nice fluffy brush one
that's not too dense you want it to be
extra soft just wipe that away this one
is the Sigma tapered highlight brush
it's really nice for this I baked to the
side of my nose I baked the center of my
nose so it leaves a
nice highlighted look make sure you
really blend it away but then it kind of
contours the nose for you even more just
want to make sure you really blend away
that translucent powder because you
could look crazy if you leave like a
white cast which sometimes happens to
the best of us so next I'm going to go
ahead and go into my bronzer and I'm
using a new bronzer today this one is by
Marc Jacobs and it's in the shade
tantric this big bronzer palette and I'm
going to use the Mac 137 brush I've been
using this lately to bronze up my skin
because it's really really fluffy it's
not super dense basically it's going to
give you not so much a defined contour
look but more of like an overall bronze
because it's so light and fluffy and
you're going to avoid harsh edges with
this so I kind of like to use this when
I tan up my whole face I've been using
this slightly and this bronzer is really
nice watch out Matt give me some really
get into that hairline those sideburns
down the jawline sometimes I'll even
like kind of give a few swipes through
the neck and then I've if you want to
look really bronzed like naturally the
Sun bronze do you sometimes I even give
a little swipe of bronzer across the
nose so it looks like the Sun has been
tanning my face all day next to add an
all-over bronzy glow I'm going to be
using the mineralized skinfinish by Mac
and this isn't gold deposit and I'm
going to continue using this brush
because like I said it distributes
product lightly this has more of a Goldy
undertone it's not so much like a
highlight for me but it does give a
bronze glow it's really pretty
I even put some on my chin just cuz it's
very light all right then we're gonna
move straight into blush I'm going to
use one of the new makeup geek blushes
and this is in the shade and fashion
apply that I'll be using the blush brush
by Marc Jacobs you really want to work
the blush into the bronzer this blush is
such a pretty color it's not too pink
it's not too peach it just kind of gives
like a nice warm look to the skin
buuut above these colors together is
like my dream we're gonna move straight
in to highlight I'm using a new
highlight today I'm trying this out for
the first time it's the violet Voss Pro
highlight powders they look like this i
swatched a few of them already as you
can see my fingerprint in there but I
have not used them on my face so I think
what I'm going to do is I'm going to mix
star glow which is a little bit of a
peachy shade and moon gleam which is a
more white based highlight just to kind
of get an in-between color I'm just
going to apply that with a fan brush and
I give like a nice C shape sometimes
I'll go back into the Mac 137 to blend
the highlight out just a little bit if I
get a little carried away which is
always alright so we finished the face
makeup super easy I also put the
highlight down my nose here now we're
just going to finish the eye makeup so
I'm going back into the light brown
color from the sugah Beauty eyeshadow
palette and I'm going to use the dose of
colors pencil brush this is my favorite
pencil brush for the lower lash line
because unlike a lot of pencil brushes I
own which are really stiff this one is a
little bit more soft so it blends the
eyeshadow out really well it's almost
like a very small miniature blending
brush I'm gonna smoke the lower lash
line out with this color surprise
surprise
me smoking out my lower lash lines
unheard of I feel like the reason I
always smoke my lower lash line out is
because I don't have a lot of lashes so
to add drama on the lower lash line
that's like my version of it that's what
I do and then you just want to connect
this eye shadow to the outer corner of
the wing we made out here so now to
really get under the waterline with a
dark shadow I'm using Cypress umber and
this is from
Abah Modern Renaissance palette this
probably kind of has like a lot of
fallout when you dip your brush into it
so be careful but I'm taking that dark
brown and I'm just going to press it
right under the waterline and make sure
you use pressing motion so that the
eyeshadow doesn't fall onto your
concealer that you just work so hard to
apply in the waterline I actually like
to use the benefit high brow this is
really like bright it's not super white
it has like a pinky undertone and it
stays in the waterline really well this
is actually a under brow highlighting
product but it works so well on the
waterline for me do you see how like
crazy that oops
by placing that light color in the
waterline it just kind of makes your
eyes pop just gives you a really cute
little doll eye effect which I love all
right so where the drama is gonna come
into this eyeshadow look is really with
lashes I use the Koko lashes in Queen B
on the top and then these bottom lashes
which are my favorite bottom lashes to
apply they're from house of lashes and
they are in the style precious these are
actually pretty easy to apply I just
take them with tweezers and then you
look down put them underneath your
natural lashes connect the outer corner
and then go into the inner corner for
the lips I'm gonna be using the bare
minerals is one of their new nude
lipsticks it's a liquid lipstick and
it's in the shade home of course it's
nude these smell like chocolate milk
just smells so good I try to put my
finger on like what the smell was and I
just realized it's chocolate milk
