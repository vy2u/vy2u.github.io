the today's video is going to be a
favorites video which I haven't done in
forever I don't usually do that monthly
because I don't have favorites monthly I
kind of just wait until I have things
that I'm really excited to talk to you
guys about and then I make the video and
I have products that I'm excited to
share with you guys so let's go ahead
and get right into it so the first thing
I'm going to talk about is actually my
lip color right now because I love this
lip color and it's an affordable
drugstore mass lip cream and this is the
craze by Milani it's their amore matte
lip cream and I'm just excited because
it is an affordable brand and it does
look really really beautiful it's so
vibrant it's not patchy whatsoever it's
like a beautiful vibrant neon coral
shade and I just feel like if you're
looking for a good formula in the
drugstore Milani has a really good one
I'm wearing it now so you could see how
vibrant and not patchy it looks I
applied one light layer first and then I
went over it one more time with a more
generous layer I like to do that just so
it kind of stays longer that's how I
apply all my liquid lipsticks it looks
so good super even doesn't feel chunky
doesn't feel cakey it doesn't feel like
I have anything on my lips and it
doesn't feel drying either and it
doesn't transfer I've been using this
palette recently this is the new brow
spectrum palette by zueva looks like
this if you're really into brow powders
I feel like this is such a nice palette
because it has so many different colors
the reason I like it is because it also
has to shimmer shades for brow bone
highlight in our corner highlights and
it has one matte shade well I like to
set my eye all over with a more bone
colors shade and it has that perfect
color in the palette as is this color in
the center is a little bit warmer and
works really well as a transition shade
in the crease this is the one that I use
on my brows which is BR o6o very
technical I use this shade sometimes a
little bit of this darker brown shade as
well on the tail of my brow where it's a
little bit sparse then we have two
really really cool tone colors if you
have a more ashy or cool tone hair color
or brow color what I like about this
palette is it's just so universal even
though it's a brow palette it has so
many things that you could use on
like I said the shimmer colors I use
this inner corner or brow bone highlight
this one to set I love to use this one
as well you could use it in the crease I
use this dark brown shade if I have like
a club for a breakout you know you guys
know I like to turn them into beauty
marks like I have here there's one over
here as well I like to do that that's
just something I like to do and this is
the Perkins Brown because it is cool
tones dark brown we besides this color
which is a little bit too wet for me I
use every single color in this palette
for something so it just has a lot of
different uses I feel like this is such
a great Universal palette and it's good
for a professional makeup artist who
need a lot of different colors and it's
also good for just one person who don't
need a lot of colors it's great I love
it so next we have this Oprah blush
palette it's this nice huge professional
palette this is something I also like
because like I said it has everything
you would need in one palette I actually
like things like this lately because
with traveling I don't like to take a
lot of loose things I like to come have
as many things condensed and in one
place as possible so if this is good for
traveling because you never know what
makeup look you're doing and so you
never know what color blush you may need
but you could just take this one palette
and have all these different blushes and
I especially love this color right here
because it's a super bronzy warm tone
which I like obviously and now I'm into
the bronze I also love this one there's
some lighter shades for lighter skin
tones and of course there's darker
shades for darker skin tones so there's
kind of a lot of things going on it's
probably the only one I don't really use
actually these two I don't really use
this one's a little too light for me
this one's you know a little too bright
for me this is a really good on-the-go
palette I've been using all the blushes
from here basically every day oh no I
left my translucent powder slightly open
apparently and it just spilled all so
the next item we're going to talk about
is the Kat Von D lock-it brightening
powder this is different than her
translucent powder two came out with
this one and I believe there's three
shades petal peach and then this one is
golden so this is what it looks like
this color golden kind of reminds me of
like a banana
powder so I tried peach and it was a
little bit too dark when I was doing my
makeup on snapchat I felt like it looks
really good but then when I did it more
in daylight it was a little bit dark but
it did cancel out any as darkness so I
feel like for deeper skin tones or if
you have a lot of darkness under the
eyes it would cover really really well
petal is a little too light for me and
so I tried bolding which is a little bit
more of a yellow undertone I kind of
have like pros and cons about this
powder I've really really been liking it
as far as the way it fits under my eyes
the brightening it does is like on
another level the only thing I've
noticed if you like to bake this is
probably not my favorite for baking
because it does give you kind of a
flashback if you put too much it can
kind of look crazy I I do that to myself
and took some photos and I was like what
what I do now is just powders I actually
mix a little bit of this with my Laura
Mercier translucent or if you don't want
to do all of that this is better as like
a light dusting under the eyes opposed
to like packing it on underneath it does
sit really well in the fine lines and it
looks really really pretty at night it
does what it says it does brighten but
don't use too much because it'll
brighten just too much that's my two
cents on this powder
I still have been using it and I really
like how it looks but you just have to
be careful we're going to move on to
concealers and I've been using these and
kind of talking about one of these a lot
this is the Becca luminous perfecting
concealer I always want to say luminous
silks I'm used to saying that for my
founding I've been using the shade
medium and I love this concealer so much
because it's so natural I could
literally put this over my breakout my
under eyes and have no other makeup and
it looks like I'm wearing nothing it
kind of looks like you have perfect skin
I wouldn't use this if you want like a
super full coverage look but if you are
fully who likes to wear a little
concealer to the gym or you just want to
have those quick no makeup days I like
to blend this in with my finger so it's
also really fast you don't need to blend
it in with a brush I know some
concealers work better with a Beauty
Blender things like that but this one
just looks so pretty and I almost didn't
give this concealer a chance thankfully
I decided to give it a shot because I
love it so so much it's one of my
favorite easy to wear concealers so
beautiful I'm just like I've never seen
a formula like it I really really love
it and this is on the other spectrum of
the concealer family and I'm sure a lot
of people have heard of this because you
guys have all been hearing about it
because it's that good it really is that
good first I wasn't a fan of them
because for me it was a little too
drying in the direct under eye area for
me but if you have hollows in your eyes
or something that you really want to
cover this is just so amazing so what I
do is I put a little bit of this
concealer like in the close under eye
area and this one I kind of place it
like right here bring it down
the sides of the nose to slim it out
it's so nice it's so full coverage it's
just like makes everything look seamless
like no hollows no anything and this is
a trick I learned from Patrick Todd his
makeup class so when you do the line of
concealer down the bridge of your nose
you let it dry lit a little bit more
than you would normally and then you
blend it out and it almost leaves a more
defined perfect line down your nose so
it stays this is something I wouldn't
wear with like a no makeup day though
this is very full coverage so that's
where this one comes in so they're kind
of just opposite whatever you're looking
for these are the best next we have the
Bobbi Brown golden bronze sparkle liquid
liner I really also like the Kat Von D
bronze eyeliner the ones with the
sparkles in it
but this one is by far the easiest
liquid liner applicator to use what I
really really like about this liner is
it has these fine gold reflex in it any
time I'm at an event and I'm under
basically any life its sparkles so so
much and I get a lot of compliments I
definitely want to check out the black
one of this you guys have tried it let
me know because I want to try that one
as well if you see it just has a really
nice fine point the brush itself isn't
really stiff sometimes they're a little
bit too stiff so it makes it harder to
give that little flick that I just did
on accident so Anne this looks so good
and the wings always come out sharp so
next we have and I have to read the back
because it's such a long name it's the
airbrush flawless finish skin perfecting
micro powder and this is in the shade to
medium
recently Katie and I went to have dinner
with Charlotte Tilbury it was incredible
because she's an amazing artist and I've
always loved watching her YouTube videos
her voice is just so soothing you could
literally listen to her speak forever
and I've always just kind of heard such
great things about her product so when
we got to go meet with her and she gave
us these things I was so excited and
this powder has by far come through for
me like so much I've never really had a
good setting powder I've always used
powder foundation which I love powder
foundations because they give you a full
coverage finish but they're not
necessarily good for blotting throughout
the night when you get oily you keep
adding coverage it starts to cake and it
starts to look kind of you know kind of
suss this powder is really nice because
it's so finely milled but it never takes
up and it sounds so crazy to say that
but for example for me I want to apply
this on the sides of my nose all the
time because the sides of my nose get
really oily and I could do not it never
gets cakey it never looks heavy it just
looks so smooth and actually blurs out
like any imperfections if you get oily
you need to blot throughout the night
this is perfect to have in your purse I
have all good things to say about this
amazing powder for this next item I
thought I was throwing in but I know I
talked about it so much I've done brow
tutorial with it I did a campaign with
benefits so obviously like I'm a huge
fan the benefit to brow is another
amazing brow product I thought like
nothing could be the abh brow stuff
until I tried this and it's been amazing
and I love it so so much especially if
you have a lot of sparse areas in your
brows this is a really really good brow
pomade and I love it
the cute little container just has boom
it has like the brush built-in you know
most of the time when things come with
built-in brushes or brushes and the
palettes like their shapes may stuff
that's just the truth a lot of things
that come with things are not good but
this is actually good I actually used
this for my brows almost every single
day this stuff is just amazing if you
haven't tried it I advise you guys to
try it because it's really really good
and I'll also link my brow video in the
description box you can kind of see it
in action I use the color number 4
this is a really nice medium to dark
brown and it has more of an ashy
undertone it's not as warm so if that's
something you're looking for this is a
perfect color for you this item I'm a
little bit late to the game because I
feel like so many people always talked
about this item and I've just started
using it the tatcha luminous dewy skin
mist
I've seen a lot of people rave about it
I've actually gotten to have a good
relationship with ChaCha and I've
learned a lot about this mist because I
know some people have tried it and not
liked it and they kind of told me why it
is a dewy skin mist if you put too much
it has like some of type of oils in it
it could just look too oily they
literally said one spray on one side of
your face one spray on the other side of
your face and that is what's going to
look good for you I like to kind of just
block off my highlight and spray over
that because it sets the highlight in to
your skin and makes it look so much more
glowy I don't want the rest of my face
to be that glowy so I kind of just and
it looks so beautiful but I don't only
use this when I wear makeup I love to
put this on my skin when it's more of
like a bare skin look I'll just put a
little concealer under my eyes and on
blemishes and then just kind of like
give myself a few mists to this and
you're just going to look glowing I
wouldn't really recommend it if you have
super oily skin because it is a little
bit more I don't want to use the word
oily because I feel like that's so
negative but it's more it's like
definitely very dewy you have dry skin
oh my god it's going to be phenomenal
this stuff is really really nice you
know be a little modest with it I guess
because it can look a little too much
all I'm saying all right so this next
product has kind of been like an
absolute lifesaver for me and kind of
just baffles my mind how I've gone my
whole life without trying this because
this is an easy remedy for breakouts and
it's actually pretty affordable compared
to like you know spending a lot of money
on just different types of breaking out
medications and things like that this is
just the one I have it's the desert
essence tea tree oil I recently started
using this when I was getting a facial
with really glow I love her after she
kind of extracted my situations she
would put a little bit of tea tree oil
on top of them and I asked her about it
and she was like yeah that's really good
for breakout it's not going to dry out
your skin too much so I decided to give
it a shot you do have to dilute tea tree
oil because it
is really really strong and if you use
it just like straight up it can I want
they burn your face because it's like
scary to Sam it is a potent thing and
you have to dilute it with water so if
you do decide to try tea tree oil
please read reviews on it first and how
it's helped other people because you
know there's reviews on both ends for my
skin type it definitely helped me and
every single time I have a breakout I
dilute it with water and I put a q-tip
and I dip it in put it on my breakouts
and I swear the next day they've gone
down drastically like 80 percent boom
it's like down since using it and kind
of changing my skincare that has gotten
a lot better if you guys are interested
in my skincare I also did a video
recently and I'll link it as well in the
description box read reviews don't
always just like listen to what people
are telling me but if I'm telling you
something because your skin is
definitely something that you want to
take care of and you want to make sure
you don't have allergies so maybe even
doing like a little spot test or
something but just know that no matter
what I tell you guys it's always get
your research on your own and just you
know see what's going on with different
products and things like that for me
personally it has just changed my life
and last forever I've been using this
for a hot minute and it looks like I
just bought so next up we have a
haircare product and this is the way dry
shampoo foam when I first got this I was
a little bit skeptical because I
actually have to blow-dry my hair with a
round brush because I have frizzy like
curly hair I don't like to put any wet
products in it because then I'm afraid
my roots are going to get kinky again
when you apply a small amount make sure
that you keep rubbing it in until it's
like completely dry once you really
really blend it in it doesn't stay like
that sticky mousse-like texture it just
gets really nice and powdery and if
anything this gives my hair volume more
than anything I put it in my hair and
literally after my hair was out to here
who is just so voluminous and I have
really flat hair at the top here so
anything I could use without having to
tease it I feel like it's so exciting
for me so this product has just been
amazing I know it's coming out soon I've
been trying it and I love it and I just
wanted to tell you guys what I thought
in my reservations because I know that
makes that might be reservations for
some of you guys because missus this is
kind of just like a weird thing to me
should I give you a little
see what it looks like just just on my
tweezers all right this is a body care
item and it's from Kota Lee it's the
vine body butter oh I could smell this
all day I love anything grapefruit
scented and it doesn't advertise a
grapefruit scent but that's what I smell
and my friend smelled it too and she
also thought it was grapefruit so oh my
god like it's so clean and fresh and
like just the right amount of fruity
without being too overpowering this is
something I like to put on before bed I
still love the Nivea lotion for daytime
or like event because it makes you look
really really like a greased turkey but
this one isn't like as greasy it's more
just like a really nice rich cream and
it's good before bed because it's just
thick right it's going to like seep into
your or my alligator skin because my
legs can get really dry sometimes it's a
just rich and grape and shea butters
it's smooth lightly fragranced texture
instantly soothes dry tight feeling skin
deeply nourishes the skin is supple and
comfortable ideal as an after Sun
product so yeah it kind of does give you
that like really nice relaxing like
feeling I just love body butters so this
one for a nighttime use for me is just
everything I'm not gonna lie to you guys
I honestly just feel like there's
nothing about this other than like it
just feels luxurious and the smell just
makes me so happy and that's why I love
it and I've been using it so much and it
just it so the last thing I have in my
favorites this month is be a supermodel
body and this is by Charlotte Tilbury as
well this is also a new product that
I've been using and you guys kind of
already know the journal with me like
anything that makes you glow and look so
youthful and highlighted and that's what
this does for the body let's see how it
looks on camera it kind of gives you
like that nice highlight down the leg
which makes your leg look slimmer it
just picks up the light really well so
it does have shimmer and what's nice
about this if you have a special event
is it doesn't transfer to your clothing
all right so this is what it looks like
and then you rub it into
and as you can see it gives you like
that highlight all the way down even
though you're putting it all the way
around that's the part that the light is
going to catch so it makes your legs
look slimmer and more fit if you see
that no glow glow no glow glow so like I
said it does give you that swimmer
appearance it actually says slimmer
shimmer on the bottle itself and it's
supposed to shape hydrating glow and I
really feel like it does do die if you
have any muscles like you know I know
about fake muscles here you want to put
some on the muscles like it's going to
just pop all those things that come
forward a little bit more so very very
nice really highly recommend this if
you're getting married wedding day
saying this is beautiful it's kind of
like a timeless gloss I was wrong about
my eyelashes I only have one pair so it
was like really hard to talk about them
because like I can't show them to you
other than just on my eyeballs right now
but these are the new iconic lights and
you guys know that I basically wear
Iconix in all my videos and I know a lot
of you couldn't wear ikonics because
they're making too heavy the band is too
thick I've heard a lot of people say
they don't work for them for those
reasons
so what House of lashes did is they
created a lash just like the iconic but
they made them lighter so less hairs so
they're not as dense and the band is a
lot thinner probably half the size I
just love these eyelashes I feel like
with no makeup look or a more natural
flutter these are just everything I
still love the ikonics but I'm kind of
like torn between which one I love worn
out because these ones are so pretty if
you guys have tried at the iconic lashes
and maybe they didn't like work for you
I highly highly advise you to try the
iconic light I just started wearing them
like three days ago but I thought I
throw it in because by the time I make
my next favorite video which you know
who knows when that'll be so I want to
share them with you guys alright so
that's it for my favorites I really hope
that you guys enjoy them if you've tried
any of these products they worked for
you if they didn't let you know let
people know in the comments down below I
know a lot of you guys did this in one
of my other videos and it really made me
happy to kind of see everybody talking
about products and their expiry
because you know I'm just one person I
have not the same skin type as everybody
that's watching and so when you guys
kind of chime in and talk about how
products worked for you in the comments
like I feel like it really helps other
people watching and it just makes it
kind of more of like a fun conversation
community type of thing in the comments
but everything really hope you guys
enjoyed the video and I'll see you later
but oh hello you do you need me right
now so you're saying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
