today is actually another requested
video right here this is the makeup look
it's a really nice sultry smoky eye I'll
put the Twitter name right here on the
screen so thank you for that request
alright so let's get started
I already primed my face using the Too
Faced hangover primer it's super
hydrating is going to give you a nice
dewy finish and I got this in my Ipsy
glam bag this month next I'm going to go
in with my Maybelline superstay better
skin foundation I picked this up at the
drugstore just to test out and I've been
loving it has a similar texture to make
up forever HD and I'm just going to
stipple that on with my Beauty Blender
since we want our eyeshadow to last a
long time I'm going to use this Jessie
girls eye shadow primer before applying
my eye shadow base this is just going to
make sure everything lasts really long
especially since we're doing a super
smoky eye today and then to really even
out the skin tone on my lids I'm going
to use the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and
I'm just going to apply that using a
synthetic buffer brush go ahead and set
that with either a cream colored
eyeshadow or a translucent powder which
is what I'm doing here I'm going into
the melt cosmetics eyeshadow stacks and
I'm picking up the shade unseen which is
a really nice warm light brown and I'm
going to run that through the crease and
I'm going to make sure to bring it into
the inner corner all the way to the
outer corner of the crease just create a
really round shape with this next I'm
taking enigma and this is a super deep
burgundy reddish beautiful color I'm
taking this on a really really fluffy
blending brush and I actually felt that
the brush was a little too big so I went
back to my Mac 217 and started to focus
that mostly into the crease you want to
really pinpoint this because if you have
too much red you look kind of crazy I'm
going to pick fixate it up which is a
nice blue color
and I'm going to pretty much be
repeating these steps over and over
again slightly bringing the color down
closer and closer to my lid so I'm just
going to get the blue and do the same
exact thing with the Mac 217 just kind
of get that round shape going and this
is the color we're going to be placing
on our lid so you whatever color you
place on your lid if it's a black smokey
eye a blue whatever it is you want to
first blend that color into the crease
because it's just going to make for an
easier transition so what I decided to
do is mix black and blue and Pat that on
to the lid because I wanted it to be I
don't know really smoky with a blue
undertone but very dark dark blue so I'm
mixing those two colors together and
just packing them onto the lid and you
see since we blended the blue in the
crease it's such a nice transition I'm
not going to have to blend out anything
from the lid to the crease now it's time
for concealer you know I've been mixing
your star concealer with the maybelline
instant age rewind because the Dior
concealer which is the one I'm placing
first cancels out any dark undertones in
my skin and it's not super highlighting
it just really makes sure to correct
anything and then the maybelline one is
super light so I use that more as a
highlight and I kind of just pop them on
top of each other and then I'm going to
blend them out with the Maybelline I'm
also going to use that as a highlighter
for any high points on my face so the
nose the chin the forehead and then pick
up your blue really a booty blender pick
up your Beauty Blender and go ahead and
blend that out you can also take the
time now to clean up the edges of the
eyeshadow if you need to I'm gonna start
calling it a booty blender booty blue
after you have blended out all your
concealer you always want to set it with
a powder I'm using my Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder this is my
favorite powder to set the under-eye
because it's such a lightweight powder
and it doesn't get all Creasy and cakey
it's just really nice and light next you
want to take a creamy eyeliner pencil
this one is by du say it's the ultra
precision eyeliner so I'm going to take
this eyeliner pencil and pop it in the
waterline and I'm also going to
tightline my eyes with this and take it
pretty far down the lash line because I
want a really smoky look to smoke that
liner out I'm going to pick up this
maersk brush this is the pro line
eyeshadow brush and this one's really
soft so it's not going to tug on the
lower eye skin which is very very
delicate so I'm just lightly blending
out that black eye liner and really
making sure to smoke it out then going
back into the enigma eyeshadow the red
one that we put in the crease I'm going
to take a makeup geek blending brush and
I'm just going to start really really
diffusing that block under the eyes and
tying in the red in the crease to the
lower lash line you want to apply some
mascara
this one is by Tarte it's the light
camera lashes and you just want to give
yourself a few coats of this top and
bottom
For Lashes I'm going to be using the
House of lashes siren today not iconic
not iconic siren I'm going to pop those
on with some tweezers just because I
find it's a lot easier for me to apply
lashes with tweezers especially since I
have these claws and for bronzer I'm
using Mac's give me son I'm gonna apply
this to the hollows of my cheek bones
the forehead the hairline pretty much
all over believe it or not I want this
look to be completely matte so no
highlighter today I just want lots of
bronzer I wanted to keep the focus on
the eyes with the smokiness and just
because they are so mad I wanted to keep
the whole face completely matte let's
try something different today
for the lip color I'm going to be using
this new color by color pop it's called
beeper and I'm going to apply that
directly on to the lips with no lip
liner I find that these don't really
need lip liner you can just pop it on
and it looks really really nice and
that's the last step to the makeup look
so I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
don't forget to tweet me any other looks
that you would like to see and I'll
catch you guys in my next video bye also

bloopers love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
