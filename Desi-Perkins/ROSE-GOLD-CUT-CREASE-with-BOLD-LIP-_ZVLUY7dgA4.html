today's videos gonna be on this makeup
look I decided to bring the wing back
cuz it's been a hot minute since I have
done a winged liner and you guys really
loved how the winged liner look in my 20
random facts video so I was like oh you
guys are thirsty for that wing so I
decided to do a nice winged glitter just
everything I pulled all the stops in
this video and I use new products some
of the new Kylie products some new Kat
Von D products so let's go ahead and get
started
I wanna show this is Sally's box secret
garden' ampule mask says that it has 10
natural extracts to intensify the sense
of moisture okay let's do this next I'm
just going to moisturize my skin using a
nice brightening moisturizer this one is
by simpang Beauty it's one mooster cream
and just really work it into the skin
here it'll be nice moisturize alright so
moving on to brows I haven't done my
brows on camera in like a hot minute so
I'm going to do them today this is the
benefit gimme brow shade 3 this one's
like the light/medium color I like to
put brow gel in my brows first this one
has little tiny microfibers now you can
see that this brow looks so much fuller
already so gives me a nice little base
dude my brow hairs on the ends are
looking really far I think I may have
accidentally tweeze them it's very
disappointing next I'm going to use the
goof proof brow pencil which I've been
loving and this isn't the shade number
for joining down here and then we're
just gonna start lightly building the
brow hairs let's fill these bald areas
over here so I can feel like I have my
life together if you guys can see I'm
doing like these like little short
strokes very light handed that's what's
gonna make it look more like brow hair
instead of like a block and as you're
doing it you always want to go through
with this fully make sure you're running
the spoolie through your brows because
that's gonna make it blend it's gonna
soften it
all right looking pretty good let's move
on we're gonna be using the skin blowing
bomb this is by the este edit I haven't
tried this but I want to so I'm gonna
try for the first time on camera we'll
see how it goes I know it's I think it's
more of like a sheer all-over kind of
coverage or try it out we're just gonna
go have some little breakouts here so
we'll see how sheer it is no not that I
don't like it but it's very sheer it's
like a no makeup makeup look and that's
what I'm going for right now so I'm just
gonna go ahead and switch directions
here hold please
I'm going in with my hello flawless look
how much I have left I have backups
though this is more my speed right here
see that boom gone but I'm actually
gonna take this with me on my little
mini girls weekend's right now that I'm
going to after this with Katie because I
want to have that like no makeup makeup
look the whole time I'm not trying to
slay I want to look natural
naturally unnatural you know I'm in the
shade beige I have my Murad stuff all
over my lips that's what it looks so
glossy soothing skin lip and cuticle
care stuff is the best I'm gonna let the
foundation chill for a little bit and
move on to the eyes so I'm going into my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot with my dose of
colors shader brush and I'm going to
prime my lids with this I'm going to
start at the lid and then lightly blend
it all the way up to the brow bone all
the way underneath the brow next I'm
using the wing key looks this is a
diamond powder in the shade light this
is a setting powder that's supposed to
diffuse your imperfections be nice and
lightweight I'm going to actually use
this to set my cream base and I'm just
putting this on the crease up to the
brow bone it's going to look really
white now but once we have all the
eyeshadows blend it in the crease it's
gonna look really good next we're going
to go into the crease color I'm going to
be using these these I'm going to be
using this honest Beauty trio this is
the truly effortless soft stand it just
has some nice neutrals I'm going to take
this color for
first it's nice light brown using the
pencil brush from dose of colors I'm
going to start it off here we're just
taking a little bit of that soft Brown
lightly and creating my shape on this
outer corner here then I'm going to pick
up this Vasanti contour eyeshadow brush
perfect to blend out small areas so I'm
going to use this and blend out that
line we did and diffuse it outwards a
laydown color with this brush because it
gives me a precise application but then
to diffuse the edges I pick up this
brush next I'm picking up the rose gold
Kylie
cream shadow this is from the birthday
Collection I'm going to pick that up on
a Lexie five to eight concealer brush
and I'm going to start applying that all
over the lid taking that all the way
into the inner corner and then I'm also
going to take it right under where you
did that crease and kind of cut the
crease with this as well clean it up you
need a smaller concealer brush for this
I'm just taking that out all the way
following right underneath the crease
shadow that we laid down next I'm
picking up this deeper shade and I'm
going to intensify the crease on the
outer part of the eye just a little bit
now taking my zoeva 317 brush and my
Inglot gel liner I'm going to attempt to
create a sharp wing first I'm going to
start at this outer part of my eye
you guys notice my brush ya can only eat
that somebody put my brushes on the
floor not naming any names so we're
going to take the liner and kind of
create a little point in this inner
corner of the eye real quick and I'm
just going to go ahead and clean all of
that up next I'm going to use the it
cosmetics no tug waterproof liner you
want to use a waterproof liner in this
area that way it doesn't run on your
lower lash line and we're doing this so
that when we apply our eye lashes you
don't see skin between your liner and
the lashes I'm just going to play a
quick layer of mascara this is the lash
domination by bare minerals and then I'm
gonna is my house of lashes Iconix I was
just telling Steven I'm like I really
need to start using different lashes I
mean not in life just maybe in videos
because these are my favorite and I tend
to use them alocs I feel like they just
go with every look but if you guys have
any lash recommendations other than
Ardell because I know you know I've used
those as well like I already know about
those so if you guys have any other
recommendations let me know in the
comments below I always want to try the
like the lower lashes but they're always
so uncomfortable for me so I don't know
if you guys have tried ones that are
comfortable let me know pop these on now
I'm going to go ahead and apply my
concealer so that I could finish my
lower lash line this is the NARS creamy
concealer they just came out with six
new shades and my new favorite shade is
macadamia it's like a mixture of ginger
and custard so it does have the peachy
undertones that corrects the under-eye
but it also is a little bit lighter than
ginger so it's like custard which
highlights more for me for my skin tone
so I've really been liking this color
even though the name threw shade at me
if you follow me on snap it out I always
like to run the concealer under my wing
because that's what makes it really
sharp before I put concealer on the
other eye I'm going to blend this out so
it isn't set you just want to blend this
line out all the way up to the hairline
like like so we're not going to leave
that line though you have to turn your
Beautyblender over and blend that out so
that there's no just like concealer line
going across your temple see how clean
the wing looks now with the concealer it
just makes such a difference it's crazy
putting the concealer also down the
bridge of my nose and keep it slow boom
blending that out just at the under eyes
I'm gonna use the new Kat Von D
translucent powder so I use this the
other day and I felt like it held up the
only thing that's different is that it
kind of has like a satiny finish then
I'm just gonna lightly just the setting
powder off I'll let you guys know how I
feel about those translucent powders so
far I don't know but I will let you guys
know if I ever forget to let you guys
know remind me thank you so much
sometimes I forget I'm gonna go into
this visi art palette and take this deep
brown and some of this brown it has like
a if a matte color could have a rose
gold undertone I mix those two together
and run it on my lower lash line only on
the outer corner and then blending it
towards the inner corner but not taking
it all the way round that out on the
outer corner I'm applying my 8 cosmetics
tightline mascara to my lower lashes I'm
gonna put like some glitter up in here
because why not let's take this look all
the way I'm going to use this jcat
glitter rock in the night
sparkling powder Rose Goldy light and
I'll be using the lit clearly liquid
glitter base to just apply that I'm just
going to put that like right around here
get my brush into the glitter and see
what happens hopefully I don't mess up
as I get like over here I'm it's getting
like more sparse so I'm just lightly
dabbing it there so that it kind of
greedy eights out for the face I'm using
Mac's give me Sun it's been a while
since I've used this and I'm using a
real techniques blush brush I'm kind of
more so using this warm at my face not
so much contour but just kind of run it
all over the high points of my skin when
I'm breaking out on my contour area I'll
take Mac Studio Fix powder this is like
a powder foundation it's a really dark
color and I'll go over it with that as
well because it has more coverage so
that it covers up those breakouts a
little bit better and I mix it with give
me Sun - brings life to my face I was
feeling so blah football throwing you're
just like next I'm going to go in with
my japonesque blush and this is the
Velvet Touch blush and shade oh -
blending it into the bronzer you can
layer this blush and you could just keep
laying it for more intensity or you
could just do a light wash of it blends
really nicely into the bronzer for the
highlight I wanted to do something in
that rose gold color family so I'll be
using champagne pop just because it has
that really pretty thick rose gold
foiled look I'm going to use that as my
highlight today when I find my
highlighting brush which is down here
I'll be right there
this is the Laura Mercier highlighting
brush it's actually called the fan
powder brush
oh yes give it to me in my Ipsy glam bag
I got this lip color and this is the
Lord and berry maxi matte lip cran
this is a nice comfortable matte formula
in the shade is dark rose
so you could either go for this more
rosy tone to kind of go with all the
rose colors or a nude color I know I've
been doing a lot of nudes so I want to
kind of switch it up and try something
bolder so I'm going to give you another
lip option as well any time you switch
lip colors it's nice to like just put
the Beauty Blender over it gets the
foundation back on a lot of you guys
wanted to see the new Kylie liquid
lipstick in the shade leo so I'm just
going to go ahead and use that and it
comes with the lip liner the matching
lip liner as well
you
I like the Kiley liquid lipsticks but
this color for some reason feels like a
little patchy some places it's dark and
then in some it's a little bit lighter
so be aware this color in particular
sometimes different color formulas like
tend to be patchy ER than others that
one's just like a little little uneven
like I wish I could just get it even but
I've layered it and it didn't really
come through for me so I'm gonna go
ahead and set my makeup now using the
Urban Decay all nighter fix my her I'm
gonna go ahead and spray some marula
daily moisture mist this is just like a
leave-in conditioner or a heat
protectant all right so this is the
finished look super glam glitter cut
crease liner old lip I did it all I am
headed out to my girls trip I may need
to take this off the glam going to the
beach but I hope you guys enjoyed the
tutorial thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video
