today's video we're gonna be doing a
makeup tutorial on this look right here
this was voted by you guys to do and
also request it in the never have I ever
video I'm doing the whole eye look using
the new kathleenlights colourpop palette
and this is so good I love this
palette it's gonna go in my favorites
for this month for sure with all of that
say let's go ahead and get into the
tutorial I wanna take the heart shape
tape and medium medium I'm gonna go
ahead and use that as my eyeshadow base
I'm just taking my dose of colors flat
concealer brush and I like to run that
right under the brow
I always do this when I want like a
super sharp clean look which is kind of
what we're going for in today's look so
I took a poll on IG stories and I asked
you guys what makeup look you guys
wanted me to film today and I was pretty
surprised because the two options were
this look and the sparkly green look I
thought you know for sure that sparkly
green look because you know I'm always
doing like warm tone looks and they
always want something different but you
guys don't actually want something
everyone do you want those warm tones
sparkly rose gold looks still lie so now
I'm just taking a little bit of my Laura
Mercier translucent powder I'm gonna set
the concealer so that it's not all
sticky and it dries nice and matte and
powdery that's gonna make everything
easier to blend I usually skip this part
but I thought I'd add it because it's
always the same here sometimes I'll use
like a bone colored eyeshadow which I
like to use for the brow bone highlight
still might do that after this is just
to get everything modified here this
whole eyes shadow look I did using for
the most part the kathleenlights
colourpop dream street palette really
pretty the tones in here I really like
the blues the warm tones the matte
colors like I said I'm gonna use a bone
colored eyeshadow to highlight the brow
bone and there's not really one in here
so I'm gonna use Mac Brule on the brow
bone here Mac Brule is gonna make me
change my mind real quick it's not
really showing up as much as I need it
to you know what does give it to me as a
brow bone highlight Kat Von D matte
metals palette I love bone so I'm gonna
use own Oh putting it on the high points
and then I'm gonna blend it out feather
it out on the edges
now that we've highlighted the brow bone
I'm just kind of dragging it downwards
blends nice so now I'm gonna go into the
dream Street palette and the first color
I'm gonna be taking is darkness from the
palette it's this light orange shade and
I'm using my Mac 286 brush I've really
been liking this brush and we're gonna
apply that in the upper crease I'm
taking it all the way down to downtown
and we're really just gonna keep
building this color until we have a nice
gradient into that
a bone highlight yes I've loved this mac
brush it's um
I don't know what it is about it but it
just blends everything so nice and easy
alright next we're taking this shade
right over here using the same brush I'm
gonna apply that into the crease and I
like to tilt my head and look down into
a mirror so that I could really see my
eye socket shape and follow that this
technique helps especially if you have a
hard time finding your crease I'm also
gonna let that go on to the outer v 2 as
well this color definitely picks up more
like rosy pinky than it looks in the pan
and the pan it looks more of like kind
of like a Sienna type color but then
once you apply it it definitely is a
little bit more on the pinky side which
I like we're gonna take a clean brush
and blend out those edges so now that
we're all smoked oh we're gonna go into
the deep shade mooney first we're gonna
pack it on to the outer corner of the
eye give a little depth over here in
this area I'm just packing it on with a
pencil brush first and then I'll use a
blending brush to blend it out I'm also
gonna run that on the upper lash line
just across the lid a little bit into
the lashes they're kind of hitting it at
a diagonal gonna give you that sultry
Nick so how was your Christmas or how
are your holidays I am officially done
eating bad food alright I always say
that I ate so much that this morning I
woke up and my stomach was like hard as
a rock bloated like pretty bad it caught
up to me just thought I'd share that
with you guys it's pretty bad over here
on my end as far as the bloat you know
you just can't feel bad you just the
holidays you should just enjoy and eat
and spend time with your family have a
good time you know we had a really good
Christmas I spent time with my dad went
to Katie's house also spent time with
Stevens family Steven and I baked pies
for the first time ever from scratch
okay
I'm very proud I'm gonna say it five
hundred thousand times because making
the dough for that pie was not easy you
think it'd be like just follow the
directions and you're good but no it's a
feeling you have to feel the dough be
one with the dough or else your crosses
in to come out like
and it took us a few times to get it
right but then when we did we were like
yes okay we're getting smoky over here
so basically I'm just building it up and
then as I build it as I build it I'm
taking it into the inner corner as well
just deepening up the socket right into
the crease with whatever's left over on
the brush but you want the majority of
the depth to be on the outer taking it
downtown over here too and then when
there's nothing really left
I'll feather out the edges here now
we've done all the blending and all that
stuff we're gonna go ahead and move on
to the lid and I'm gonna carve the lid
out cuz it's okay if you make it messy
when you're blending it as long as you
keep most of it in the crease cuz then
we're gonna take concealer and just
clean it up taking medium again on the
same little concealer brush that we were
using earlier look down really get a
feel of where your creases and then just
clean up the lid and I start like low so
I don't mess up and then I'll make my
way to the crease little by little I
find that like holding the brush and
then dragging down helps me get a better
line I don't know what that does to my
actual eyelid space it probably makes it
wrinkly a faster but you know here we
are like everything they tell you in
skincare is don't tug on your skin look
at this eyelid you see makes it look
clean so now I'm just taking a paper
towel and cleaning off that concealer
brush that we just used and I'm gonna
use the same brush for the lid color and
that lip color is gonna be this one
right here it's so pretty
shooting star boom looks so like wet
shimmery metallic and I believe I did
actually spray my brush with a little
bit of fix+
to just pump it up even more I like to
do that when I want it to be even more
like a mixed wet metal
I love this color it also helps to wet
your brush when you get to like the
crease right here because it gives you a
really nice precise application of the
eyeshadow opposed to it being like all
powdery it kind of makes it more of like
it just glides on and you want a precise
line up there so wet the brush and then
really get up here into this crease I
love it oh this is also the look that I
was wearing in the never have I ever
video you guys all requested in the
comments that I do this look I love
these tones oh that lid color Kathleen
even Harper's digging it now once you
get to this area you hit it with more of
like a pack you know because you don't
want a harsh line you want to hit it
with a gradient so you just Pat it into
the matte colors on the outer corners
and you could also go back into that
more mmm warm tone shade one that we
used in the crease that like ready shade
and you could even Pat it along the edge
as well just to have a nice gradient
from the dark brown to the more ready
color to the rose gold color you can hit
that on the lower lash line here just
look a little honestly truly
kathleenlights that lid shadow I know I
said it already of a sheep killed it
okay murdered it murdered alright so
before I finish the eyes I'm gonna move
on to my foundation because do my lower
lashline don't wanna you know the drill
so I'm gonna be using the new NARS
foundation this is my new favorite
foundation right now I'm mixing Syracuse
and Barcelona
somebody told me there's a shade in
between but these work so good mixed
together for me so I'm just doing that
this is the new natural radiant long
wear foundation I have been wearing this
in all my makeup photos lately and it
just like flawless it has lasted all day
and it's just like covers everything so
nice and I've been applying it with this
Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood complexion
brush so I just have it on my little did
my mixture here I used a brush recently
cuz I was like I'm trying to hurry up my
makeup sometimes we spend a lot of time
pouncing with our Beauty Blender we
don't have a lot of time to pounce
certain days so I was like let me just
try this brush and I ended up really
loving it it just buffs everything in so
nice and quickly so I do like a nice
thin layer really get it into the skin
and then I'll go back in and really just
like press the foundation into the skin
where I want more coverage always have
to make sure to take this color down my
neck because my shoulders are dark but
my face and neck are like really light
so I've got to really match it now I'm
moving on a concealer I love to always
mix these two this is the Becca luminous
and beige always apply that one first
this one I like to apply closer to the
lash line because I feel like it's more
hydrating so it doesn't settle into my
fine lines as much as the I was gonna
call it the shark so hard for me to say
heart-shaped tape
I love the Tarte shaped tape for like
any hollowness it's like the best but
it's a little dry for like right under
my eyes so what I do is I apply this
first closer in those areas and then I
like to use tan sand because it has a
little bit more of a warmer undertone
and it cancels out any like hollow area
so I just pull up a little bit of that
right there and it's also a good
transition shade from my concealer to my
foundation okay I'm gonna take a beauty
sponge and this is LC cosmetics I love a
little point cuz it gets right up into
the tear duct there and then the point
also helps like the edge of your shadow
here then I'll just take my foundation
brush with whatever's left over and
stipple the edges to make sure it's like
seamless I take a little bit of the
medium shape tape and I'm gonna apply
that down the bridge of the nose bring
the highlights back in the face boom and
then the forehead and then of course
like right here I have a little shadow
so I'm gonna hit that one time the chin
the Kubitz Ville living that full
coverage life today I'm gonna blend the
bridge of the nose last
squish this little guy the reason I do
the bridge of the nose last is because I
want to keep the shape straight and if I
let it set just a second longer than the
rest it'll keep the straight shape
instead of blending out all over the
place you don't want to let it sit there
for too long but just it's the last
thing I blend out time to set the under
eyes what I like to do first and this is
something glam texts even taught me is
take a little bit of c-5 Studio Fix make
sure you blend all the creases out
before you put any powder and then I'm
gonna show it like this like a crazy
person I'm gonna take a little bit of
that c-5 powder just a tiny bit and
place it right under the eye first
before I apply any um translucent powder
I just go with it cuz he told me and
then I'm gonna take my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and apply that on the
under eyes no just whatever is left over
I get it on the apples of the cheeks and
then just take a small powder brush and
we're just gonna hit the center of the
face with a translucent powder as well
just so it mattifies I'm just right here
alright so now for my highlight I'm
about to use meet Emma this has a little
bit more of a rosy gold undertone so I'm
gonna use our desi Katy meet I'm a
highlight I'm gonna start with the
bridge of my nose keep with the tones oh
I'm so like in love with our highlights
I love them so much it just gives you
such a glow from within then I'm gonna
put that on the bridge of the nose to
keep its bow and then switching brushes
we're gonna take the highlighting brush
turn your teeth to the side to really
see what's going on here I'm gonna be
using the Victoria Beckham bronzer and
Java Sun this is with Estee Lauder I'm
gonna use this Smith 133 brush
for blush I'm gonna be using this Bobby
Brown
slopes slush just gonna take a Mac 116
and apply that this is a nice like rosy
color okay place so we're done with the
face now let's go ahead and finish the
lower lash line let me dust off a little
this powder I'm gonna do you know the
lower lash line the same as we always do
just mimicking the crease I'm gonna use
this color first fly that all over this
really warm tone color and I'm gonna let
it like really be heavy out here and
then take it up to the the winged out
shadow take a blending brush and smoke
it out and then you're just gonna take
the blending brush and smoke No
so now we've really smoked out that
lower lash line now I'm gonna take the
dark brown shade here and we're gonna
just put that on the outer part of the
lower lash line and define it I love
this makeup look you guys I love it I
love that it's just this palette
this dark brown does have like a little
fallout I will say so just like make
sure to tap and I'm just using a angled
brush from Target this is a badda-bing
badda-boom Sonia Kashuk I believe yep
we're gonna take a pencil brush and then
I'm gonna go into this shade right over
here called spark and this is going to
be my inner corner highlight oh boy so
I'm just gonna apply a little coat of
mascara this is my MAC mascara this is
the extended play this eyeliner is
really good I've been using the mister
right by the balm cosmetics black liner
I'm gonna put that in my waterline and
then also make sure you put it on the
upper waterline there's like nothing
worse than getting a liner on your
contact which I just did I'm taking
these Lillie lashes these are some of my
favorite lashes recently I've been
wearing them a lot these are the makeup
by samuel collab with Lily lashes
they're just like the perfect fluttery
wispy lash and then they flare out the
outer corner so it gives you that nice
winged look what I'd like to do what
applying lashes is I need to look down
into a mirror and I try to just get the
lash right on my lash line alright and
the last step of this look is the lips
i'm gonna be using nyx abu-dhabi and i
didn't really use a lip liner i kind of
just put it on really quick and that is
it that's the finished makeup look guys
we're all done well I really hope you
guys enjoyed the video I'll probably
still end up filming that green sparkly
look because I loved it any requests you
guys have leave them in the comments
