today's video is gonna be a tutorial on
this makeup look I wanted to do
something with lilac like for some
reason this this light purple color was
really inspiring me right here so
between this lilac eyeshadow and this
backdrop I was inspired to play around
with lilacs and pinks and glitter I
really hope you guys enjoy this tutorial
and if you want to learn how to get this
makeup look keep on watching
going into the modern renaissance
palette by Anastasia Beverly Hills I'll
be picking up a really gotta really get
real girl realgar picking that up on a
smith 230 brush I'm gonna tilt my head
back a little bit and put this in my
upper crease and I'm using a really
light hand for this cuz I don't want it
to come off crazy at first slightly
applying this eye shadow pop that into
the crease key questions me all the time
as to why I like to say pop pop it into
the crease pop on my lashes I feel like
she should just let me live rights then
you should need to let me live man you
know actually I know where I got it when
I first started watching YouTube videos
the first youtuber I started watching
was Tanya burr and I believe she says
pulp it on you know she has that accent
that I love to listen to I'm pretty sure
she uses that word and that's why I say
it I'm also going to take that shadow
and just bring it down Hyup just create
a V on the outer part of the eye next
I'm going to pick a B Smith 2:47 which
is a smaller blending brush and I'm
going to go into red ochre and we're
going to deepen up that crease you guys
know I love these red tones picking up
the brush that I used the first
eyeshadow use that brush just to diffuse
the outer corners I'm going to be mixing
Venetian red with red ochre and put them
into the crease and right below the
crease I haven't done my foundation or
concealer yet so it's okay if you get
eye shadow like over here we clean it up
later next we're going in with a gel
liner this is by color pop it's in the
shade crybaby it's Lila
color and I'm using a sigma concealer
brush I use this as a base for the lid
take that into the inner tear-duct kind
of carve out the crease a little bit
this eyelid is always super jacked it's
more folded in than this side so that's
why I always turn this like this is like
my better crease of the two so I like to
always show you guys what it looks like
on this crease cuz this one's just a
struggle crease
I always got that heavy tilt in pictures
like then once you get to the outer edge
blend it out a little bit let's goes
back with your blending brush and blend
it out next we're gonna go into this eye
shadow by makeup geek
it's called hopscotch I'm taking the
same brush I cleaned it off
professionally on the back of my hand
obviously pack the eyeshadow on over the
eyeliner that we just placed now I'm
going to go with the Venetian red lend
it into the lilac on the outer corner so
it has like a nice gradient here now
we're going to do the glitter liner this
is the Urban Decay heavy metal in ACDC
these liners are literally everything I
had to get them in every color because
they are amazing I'm gonna take this and
do the first half of the wing I like to
really look up to see how my eye folds
so that I get it perfect as I'm looking
straight I like to make the shape you
kind of have to build on this like I
built on it a lot make it this opaque
over here so I'm doing it with my eye
open first and then as I get the shape
I'll go look down and fill in the little
cracks that we got going on now that
we've built up that glitter wing I want
the outer half of the wing to be sharp
I'm going to pick up the trooper liner
and build up the outer part of the wing
here I like to use the trooper liner to
outline the wing then to fill it in I
like to use the NYC liquid liner just
because it's easier I think it's a
little bit less shiny so now I'm gonna
go ahead and apply mascara now that we
have the wing blend it out this is the
Too Faced better than sex mascara the
waterproof one it's amazing I didn't
properly curl my lashes but that's
because we're going to apply falsies
house of lashes iconic so a lot of
people tell me that they have a hard
time applying needs that they look too
big or crazy when I take this out of the
packaging it's wide for my eye
if you put something that's too wide and
closes off the eye and this part of the
eye it's going to make your eyes look
like heavy so what I like to do is
measure your eye and you just want to
cut some of the end off I like to cut
the longer side the part that goes on
the outside of the eye because the inner
part is perfectly tapered already we
don't want to mess with that so now I'm
going to go ahead and pop those on so
before I finish off the rest of the eyes
I'm going to go in with my face makeup
this is the elsi foundation in the shade
natural I'm just going in with my Beauty
Blender and applying that all over my
face
after foundation we're going to go in
with our concealer this is the NARS I
use this on every video because it's my
favorite radiant creamy concealer in
ginger when I apply concealer I always
like to apply most of the product right
below the hollows of the eyes and on the
hollows obviously to highlight I do a
little triangle here but I don't glob it
right under my eye because I like to
keep as little product there as possible
so I like to blend this up into the
under eye that way there's like less
creasing so you don't have a bunch of
product built up underneath your eye
where you have you know tend to wrinkle
more can't be having that the only place
I apply concealer close to my eye is
over here and that's to sharpen the wing
so after we've blended out the concealer
you want to set it I'm using the laura
mercier translucent powder I'm just
dipping the Beautyblender in there
and I also apply this the least amount
away from my under eyes and then I
lightly make my way over I'm doing the
baking technique because I want like a
full glam here so I'm going in and you
put this on the side of your nose
because you want to make it if you want
to make something have less shadows and
appear more narrow you can highlight
them to get rid of them over here out of
course so let it sit for like I don't
know I let it sit for like 30 seconds
because I'm impatient and then I'm going
to use my dose of color setting brush to
wipe all the excess powder away I don't
recommend this if you have dry skin or
dry under eyes I can tell when I have
drier eyes when I don't drink enough
water it really affects my creasing gets
worse and I don't do this technique
because it'll just make me look like a
mummy next I'm going to take my Mac
Studio Fix powder and NC 43 and a Mac
217 and I'm going to slightly contour my
nose with this this is a powder
foundation it's just a little bit Tanner
than my skin not really that much Tanner
so I don't want to look too overly
contoured then I'm going to bronze up my
skin using the NARS Laguna bronzer I'm
gonna mix Laguna casino because I'm
feeling rebellious on a Sigma contour
brush and after the contour we're going
to use the Jaclyn hill and Becca palette
I'm going to be taking Prosecco pop this
color here and highlighting with that
I'm going to do that C type motion over
heel I'm also going to use that
highlight on the Cupid's bow and the tip
of the nose I'm also going to pick up
the blush in the palette this pink one
right over here the same brush I used to
contour and just apply that on the
apples of the cheeks
now we're going to finish off the rest
of the eyes going back into the
Renaissance palette I think I'm just
going to take love letter which is this
color right here run that on the lower
lash line and I'm going to take this
luck see two three one brush that I used
earlier I'm just going to use that to
blend it out so that we have a nice
diffused look pick up a little bit of
wheel cur which is this like orange e
shade and I'm going to also add that and
just blend it out softly I'm gonna
ground this so we don't look sickly in a
second but I'm going to highlight my
inner corners first using the Zodiac
makeup geek sparkler sparkly to ground
the lower lash line so you don't look
like you're sick or dying you know with
the red eye shadow we're gonna take Tabu
and this is by makeup geek let's see
what we can do and it's myth 205 angled
brush which cannoli decided to chew all
my brushes are chewed cuz can only likes
to play with my makeup she somehow gets
these things I don't know how she's so
little
I'm just gonna start deepening up the
outer corner of the lower lash line with
this by adding a darker color when you
do a really blown out sort of red smokey
eye it just grounds the look so that you
don't look like you're sick gives you a
little bit more depth I'm also going to
apply a liner in the waterline so by
adding this darker color right below the
waterline it's gonna make that pop once
we add it for the waterline I'm going
back into crybaby by color pop what we
use just base I'm taking a dose of
colors liner brush and I'm just going to
line the waterline make the sexiest face
ever when you do this too I know I have
a lot of highlighter on already but I
decided to use the Pat McGrath
iridescent pink highlight just because
it's gonna go with this makeup and
there's not a lot of chances I get to
wear this so I'm just going to apply it
on the high points here just to bring
out the purples and the pinks and then
I'm going to apply some mascara to my
lower lashes using the it cosmetics
line full lash effect if I had long ass
lower lashes do you know how much more
my eyes will just be popping right now
they'd be like popping right now they're
just like for the lips I'm going to use
creme brulee and this is by joey
