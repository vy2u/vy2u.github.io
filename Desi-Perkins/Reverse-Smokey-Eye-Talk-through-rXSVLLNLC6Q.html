tutorial today I wanted to film
something different and artsy fartsy and
not really like an everyday look just
for fun I feel like it's important for
your creative brain to just do things
out of the ordinary and out of the box
and I also wanted an excuse to wear
these bunny errands because they're so
cool
I came up with this look let me take
these off so you guys can see I hope you
guys enjoy this video and let's go ahead
and get started right about now I feel
like I'm looking a hot mess I'm gonna
use this glam glow which I hear a lot of
good things about just a face mask
that's gonna leave my skin smooth and
bright and hopefully take away this like
little pimple that I have going on here
mmm smells good has little exfoliating
beads in it actually a lot of people
talked about it at beautycon it's
interesting alright so now that I've
rinsed that off I'm just gonna apply I
don't know what I'm gonna apply I'm
gonna use this you're the bomb in the
flavor grape so that my lips are nice
and soft and smooth for my lipstick
application the next thing I'm gonna do
is apply some primer when you use pixies
of flawless beauty primer this is one of
my favorite it just kind of gives you a
really like a youthful appearance next
to conceal my under eye dark circles
that I have this motives foundation
color perfecting quad and it's in the
color medium and I'm just gonna go ahead
and pick up the there's like a salmon
ish color that's gonna cancel out any
purple tones so I'm just gonna apply
that under my eyes really quick
and I'm using a zoeva concealer buffer
which is really nice so for this makeup
look I want a really matte full-coverage
finish so I'm gonna go ahead and use a
powder foundation this is Mac Studio Fix
and I'm using the color NC 35 and I'm
gonna buff that in with a zoeva 102 silk
finish brush okay so now that I'm done
with my powder foundation I'm got to
kind of skip around a little bit and
move on to my eyebrows because I don't
want to film half this video with half
of my eyebrows nobody wants to see that
I'm gonna take a little bit of soft
ochre by Mac and blend that onto my lid
just to even out the pigmentation that I
have I'm going to just do a light wash
of color over my lid just so we have
something there and it's not completely
naked and it's also gonna set that base
that we just laid down I'm gonna use
this Jay cat eye shadow and it's in the
color naked and you can wear this eye
shadow wet or dry but I'm gonna do it
dry because I don't want it to be too
intense or pigmented as it can be if you
do it wet and I'm taking this on a Mac 2
to 4 and just lightly fluffing that
color all over my lid sorry if you guys
can hear there's all the background
noise going on out there
I'm gonna put the lightest Brown in my
crease I'm just going to use caramel
from the Omni Z palette I'm just gonna
take a tap of that and apply that to my
crease just slightly
I'm actually using Krispies Monica dar
powder and c2 because she makes it look
so damn beautiful and bright and I just
feel like I need some of that in my life
today
so I'm gonna take that and just run it
under my eyes to brighten up that area
that's a lot I'm gonna go over did it
okay
just blend it out I'm gonna be putting a
lot of shadow on the under eyes so the
lightness of this is really gonna make
those colors stand out even more after
I've laid that down we're gonna warm up
the face so I like to use Mac's give me
son first
all over and that kind of gives me like
a really nice T on and I'm gonna use a
Mac 168 brush to apply that so this
isn't too specific it's just kind of
where the Sun would naturally hit you
and then kind of just blend it out a
little little pale today usually when I
contour I wouldn't take it all the way
down here but since this is just to make
it look sunkissed I'm taking it all the
way across now I'm gonna actually
contour my face it's gonna be a little
bit more precise and I'm gonna use my
contour kit for this but can you see it
can you even see I'm gonna mix these
three shades right here and I'm just
adding this right at the outer portions
of my cheekbones I'm also gonna contour
my nose a little bit well I'm just gonna
use a Mac 217 brush and I'm gonna mix
some of those Browns in the contour kit
again just lightly applying that to my
nose want to really defined nose for the
lower lash line I'm first gonna apply
this black liner it's from Lord and
berry and I'm gonna apply this just so
that the first color we place on top
shows that more intense and this is a
really smudge able liner so I'm just
gonna first apply this as a base
then I'm also gonna take this and run it
vodka inside of my top lash line we want
to go ahead and smoke out that block and
I'm using a sigma short shader brush for
this I'm gonna be using the electric
palette by urban decay and I'm first
gonna pick up this blue shade here and
it's called chaos and I'm gonna pack
that on top of the black liner that we
just put down I'm using the same brush
for this I decided to mix a little bit
of gonzo cuz Gonzo's brighter this color
here with the Kaos shade
oh I really like gonzo who actually used
this color before but I've never used it
over black so it looks a lot nicer
I feel like this makeup is really gonna
make brown eyes stand out a lot blues
and purples always make brown eyes stand
out really nicely
not that this is like a very wearable
like back to school makeup or anything
but you know if you're ever feeling
frisky this is a good look I'm gonna go
ahead and pick up the color jilted from
this palette and I'm gonna use that to
blend it out don't be afraid to go heavy
with these colors cuz we're gonna take
it low how low does she go it's gonna
kind of lick that out also I'm gonna
take a clean fluffy brush and just kind
of soften those edges out a bit I'm
gonna pick up the color savage on this
zoeva soft crease brush and I'm gonna
smoke it out under all the other colors
that we just placed down below it's
gonna be the lowest color that we have
here I feel like I lost a little bit of
intensity with the purple shade so I'm
gonna go back in and add a little bit
more purple underneath that blue that we
have laid down there I think I'm happy
with the way it looks so I'm going to
now put on a little bit of mascara and
this is just the ico black magic mascara
just gonna pop on the house of lashes
iconic eyelashes you want to try to get
them as close to the lash line as
possible since we have no liner to hide
the band her all right that was actually
fairly easy putting those on so that is
the eyes done now while my I'm gonna say
while my lips dry while my eyes dry I'm
gonna do my lips and I actually don't
have a black lipstick with me right now
so I'm gonna use that eyeliner the Lord
and berry eyeliner to fill in the
entirety of my lip so let's see how this
goes yeah
here we go clearly I'm excited for
Halloween because you guys have any
suggestions for Halloween videos I'm
gonna start really thinking about it and
filming so that I can get them out in
time so if you guys have any ideas for
me put them in the comments below I'm
gonna use this really dark gloss by
Gerard cosmetics
it's called seduction oh yes I like it
I'm filming with natural daylight so
it's like a race against time before the
Sun goes down to finish this video whew
I decided I don't want any blush but I'm
gonna put more bronzer on grab all the
dark shades with this is zoeva highlight
brush and just kind of pack it on a
little bit race against time something's
going down aggressive
okay so that is the makeup done I want
to give myself like a messy hair texture
which is good because I haven't done my
hair today so that's easy but my hair is
a little bit dirty and a trick for that
is to use dry shampoo and by doing this
it's gonna really lift the roots klore
on dry shampoo here oh girl don't worry
the white fades away once you start
teasing this will all look better once
my accessories in that I'm going to show
you guys I'm just gonna take my fingers
put it back and just kind of wrap it in
a really messy type of bun okay so now
that I finished that off its the most
exciting part which are these thank you
oh my god and that's fast with you there
so cheer and sexy at the same time
because they're like lacy and then they
have this veil and these are from snob
candy boutique I will link it down below
but oh my god I wish I could wear them
like to the grocery store I mean I can
that's it that's the completed look I
hope you guys enjoy this video and these

focus anymore but so Kay like this video
