happy December this is gonna be my
official first video for the holiday
makeup looks I wanted to do something
rose gold with a really pretty hombre
gold eyeliner I use these new color pop
liners that came out which I really
liked I also wanted to use a red lip but
I ended up using the new Kylie Jenner
lip kit color and true Brown Kay I
really wanted to show you guys what it
looks like on camera I also share with
you guys a dupe before this color just
in case you missed it or you know you
don't want to spend that much money and
you want to get something a little bit
more affordable so if you're interested
in this makeup look then keep on
watching the first thing I'm gonna do is
prime my skin I'm using the Marc Jacobs
invisible undercover primer this one I
would suggest if you want to hydrate
your skin so if you have really dry skin
it doesn't necessarily fill in your
pores though so if you're somebody with
large pores and you need that I would
get something a little thicker this one
is very thin for a foundation I will be
using this one by honest Beauty a cream
foundation which I'm not necessarily a
fan of cream foundations I've never
really liked them on myself so skeptical
with this one but I tried it the other
day and I actually really really liked
it so I'm gonna go ahead and show you
guys this is in the shade almond
slightly tanner than my face
let's see kind of match with my neck
though but it's definitely tanner than
my face that's okay I'm just gonna give
myself a tan with this the coverage of
this foundation is definitely medium to
full the finish it's not super glossy or
oily its matte it's not that matte where
it's like super dry I wouldn't say it's
as matte as the L'Oreal infallible but
you definitely don't get oily with it
and I'm just applying this with a Nick
cosmetics complexion perfection brush
which I found works really nicely with
this foundation next I'm going to go
ahead and just move on to the eyes and
I'll finish the concealer after that way
if there's any fallout we can just clean
it up I'm gonna use the Mac prep and
prime 24 hour extend eye base I'm gonna
buff that all over my lid using a zoeva
concealer buffer brush this is my
favorite brush for pretty much buffing
any eye base on because it gives you a
smooth
the application definitely don't want
anything to be patchy when you're
applying your eyeshadow base because
then your eyeshadow will also be patchy
for the brow bone highlight I'm picking
up Blanc type I believe this is mac
cosmetics on my brow bone applying a
highlight in the brow bone just makes
everything look a lot cleaner and it's
gonna make our crease colors pop more
this pimple is really bothering me it's
gonna turn it into a mole right oh my
god I have such a cute beauty we're
telling you it's the best trick in the
book my brow bone is looking pretty
white at the moment but once I put all
the eyeshadows on it's gonna tone it
down next I'm picking up frappe by
makeup geek cuz MIDI and I'm gonna run
that in the crease using a sigma Saul
tapered blending brush so within recent
months I've noticed that my eyelid shape
has changed I think it means that my
eyelid is sagging a little more than it
used to so I'm finding it harder for me
to do a cut crease so there's that I
just thought I'd fill you guys in my
life struggles and as I get to this
outer part taper it out I'm gonna bring
this into the inner part of my eye all
the way over here I'm just gonna keep
building that color up and winging it
out moles looking good next I'm gonna
take mocha which is also by makeup geek
and an angled brush I'm gonna cut that
crease take the eye shadow onto the
brush then I'm gonna dust most of the
product off on the back of my hand you
don't want to go in too crazy with dark
eyeshadow I just kind of want to get the
outline first gradually build it's
always better to start soft and then
intensify the colors as you build
because if you go in too hard there's no
turning back and then at the end I'm
also going to kind of target oh earth's
definitely don't want to keep a harsh
line like this so I'm going back into
the frappe color mixed with that
mocha or the frappe and then I'm just
gonna buff this out a little using a
softer brush this is a Mac 213
I'm just taking a sigma blending brush
and just smoothing that all out together
I'm just gonna go very lightly over
everything just to give it a nice
seamless blend I'm gonna pick up the Too
Faced natural matte palette honey butter
which is the shade here I'm going to for
more of rose gold tones and this is a
matte peachy ish rosy color perfect for
the lid and I'm packing that on also
using this to clean up that cut crease
I'm gonna take this dull iam tools
5:42 brush now pack the honey butter
color on and I'm really gonna use this
to sharpen up that cut crease right in
here I was a like a synthetic brush
butter because it gives me a more
precise application for this kind of
stuff
after I'm taking a little bit of the
frappe color into the crease to kind of
blend the lid color and the crease color
together soften up that line I do want a
sharp cut crease and I also want it to
blend really nicely next I'm gonna pick
up color pops gel liner this is in the
shade get paid it's a really pretty rose
gold I'm using a Smith cosmetics 202
liner brush here we go I'm just gonna
apply a cat eye on the outer part of the
eye here so I want the rose gold to peak
through when I put the black liner on
I'm gonna leave it like that cuz then
I'm gonna go in with black afterwards I
was originally thinking of doing black I
think I'm gonna keep it nice and soft on
the wing I'm gonna go in with over board
this is also a color pop gel liner more
bronze more Brown they'll fade into the
rose gold I really really like this
Smith liner brush so it's nice to do a
precise super sharp wing telling you
guys doing my wing on this is always
super easy and then this eye completely
different shape completely different lid
space I'm telling you it's probably why
I'm always filming like this way this
eye has more
fold and like it gives me a smaller lid
space if that makes sense
so now you have this nice like okay wing
next I'm going into this amazing
concealer it's in the shade tan golden
first gonna use this just a very light
amount cuz this concealer is super thick
placing that not directly under the eye
but just around this area here that's a
little bit darker just gonna blend this
in with the Beauty Blender so I like
this concealer just a light layer first
cuz it really covers any tiredness next
I'm going in with I'm gonna load up on
the concealer today just letting you
know I'm using NARS ginger this color is
perfect for my under eyes as you can see
I'm not applying it directly all the way
up to my lashline the more product you
apply in your lash line your lower lash
line the more creasing you're gonna have
so I recommend applying concealer in
this area and then when you take your
Beauty Blender you blend it upwards
whatever's leftover into that area that
way you have the least amount of product
in your fine lines I know this seems
like a lot of concealer it's a lot of
concealer I'm gonna blend this out
before I go into the rest of my
highlighting after buffing out the
concealer cuz I want to set them using
my Laura Mercier translucent powder I'm
gonna use an elf blush brush for this
and I'm just gonna apply the lightest
amount so when your skin is dry I have
found that baking is like your worst
nightmare so you don't want to put too
much powder if your skin is dry because
I felt like your skin contracts and
tightens with the powder and that's the
worst thing when you have dry skin it's
just gonna tighten it even more so
currently I am NOT faking my under eyes
I'm just doing the lightest amount of
powder just to set them and I'm gonna
finish up highlighting the rest of my
face I'm gonna just run this along my
nose this is the custard this is good
for highlighting for me also between the
brows and just up in this area the chin
and the Cupid's bow blend that out with
my Beauty Blender and the reason you
want to highlight the rest of your face
is because if you only highlight your
under eyes it doesn't balance out your
face right if you just have bright under
eyes on the rest of your face
is tan going back into frappe and a
pencil brush I am going to run that on
my under eyes I'm gonna go back into the
get paid gel liner by color pop creates
wing in the inner corner of my eye on
the lower lash line going back into
makeup geeks mocha and the angled brush
I'm gonna pick some of that eye shadow
up and hug the the gold wing if that
makes sense just outline the outer part
of it just like so and this is gonna
make it pop more and then I'm just gonna
follow the lower lash line all the way
to the outer edge of course you don't
want to get this in the waterline we're
gonna put a nude pencil in the waterline
next you want to open up the eyes so I'm
going to use high brow by benefit this
is actually for under the eyebrow
highlight but I used it the other day
and since it has more of a pink
undertone I feel like it'll complement
the rose gold colors so I'm just gonna
put that in my waterline it actually
works for really good in the waterline
look how bright it is I usually use NARS
Rio bonaparte for this but I lost it the
other day and so I was like oh I'll just
use this and I ended up loving how it
looked if you're looking for a pencil to
put in the waterline that's really light
this actually works better than a lot of
the pencils that I've used the NARS
one's really good too but it's also
pretty pricey we're almost done I'm
gonna go ahead and put on my mascara
this is the Tarte lights camera flashes
mascara pretty much my favorite mascara
I'm just gonna lightly coat the top
lashes because we're printing on falsies
and I'm gonna build the bottom lashes
for lashes I'll be using the Coco lashes
in Queen B
I've already out worn these they're
probably too crusty to even wear one
more time but I'm gonna do it because
it's the only pair that I have I'm gonna
go ahead and put these on I focused them
mostly on the outer corner these are
nice because they're pretty long and
full but they're still fluttery enough
to where you can see the liner
underneath and the liner is the star of
the show so you don't want to cover it
up just pushing these are the eyes done
now I'm gonna move on to just finishing
up the face
to start with the highlighter this is
the Anasazi Beverly Hills a 23 brush
dampening this brush honest hydrating
mist then place my brush in the Laura
Geller gilded honey highlight and by
wetting the brush first it just makes
the highlight pop that much more this is
a holiday makeup look so you want to be
highlighted bullying in yes and by
wetting the highlighter it makes it look
less powdery on the skin more of a sheen
I'm just gonna go ahead and highlight my
nose Cupid's bow next I'm taking etosha
to Nona contour sculpting powder in Oh
to medium with a Mac 160 brush just go
ahead and use this to contour I'm not
using give me Sun today I'm trying to
use new products for you guys feeling
really weird about it I'm branching out
I'm just contouring my face with this so
originally when I started this tutorial
was gonna do a red lip but now holding
up these two colors I feel like this
would just tie in all the colors so much
nicer than red so the red one will have
to wait for the next video plus I wanted
to show you guys the new highly matte
liquid lipstick true brown okay and the
lip liner I did do a snapchat on
comparing both Limbo from colour-pop and
the kylie one and I will say the colors
are so similar the Kylie has just a
slightly more brown undertone and the
colour-pop one has more of a red
undertone it's very very slight if you
didn't get to get this color or it was
too expensive this is a really good dupe
for it I'm gonna go in with the Kylie
lip pencil first and just line my lips
at this
and it's super opaque like you really
only need one layer of it going back in
with the liner I'm just gonna clean it
up
I really feel like these lips compliment
these eyes a lot for blush I want to
still keep it really bronzy and brown so
I'm gonna mix this orange color from the
anasazi of contour kit touch of that but
mostly the orange color apply that to my
cheeks I know my last tutorial was also
a dark lip you guys could totally switch
this out to like a nude or a red I just
felt like this looked really good plus I
wanted to show you guys the how it looks
I really wanted to show you guys the
lipstick just gonna give my face spritz
with the same mist I used earlier the
honest Beauty one this is the finished
makeup look alright guys so that is it
for this video I really hope that you
enjoyed the tutorial please tweet me any
inspiration photos that you guys may
want to see for the holidays I would
love to see your guys's requests because
