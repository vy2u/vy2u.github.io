video is going to be a full glam makeup
tutorial so start to finish
we're in do this ila with this seafoam
green color for some reason haven't ever
used it but I love looking at it it's so
unique and beautiful and I've also
teamed up with clinic for this video to
do this full-coverage flawless face glam
here I'll be using the fee on perfecting
foundation and concealer if you guys
haven't tried this it is a full coverage
natural matte finish foundation I've
used it before in my videos the
concealer and foundation one so you can
kind of just like one and done use it
and if you're interested in trying it
you guys can go to any clinic counter
and they will give you a shade match and
they'll give you like a 10 day sample so
that way you can kind of figure out with
the Aleksey foundation or for you etc
etc so let's go ahead and get started
I've already applied and eyeshadow base
and prepped my lids
the first thing I'm going to do is step
into this NARS loaded palette and I'm
going to go straight into this shade
right here surprise surprise you know I
love these tones I'm using a Smith to
3/5 brush and we're going to simply
start applying this into our crease kind
of more so in the upper crease just
giving ourselves a nice little shape
make sure I get that nice and diffused
and I'm bringing it right down into this
outer V part of the eye as well now once
we have that laid down I'm just going to
diffuse the edges and make sure that the
outer corner this is also connecting so
just this little outer V part diffuse it
out then I'm going to take a Smith 230
brush nice clean one and buff out those
edges and if you need to use a lighter
shade to sort of bless your edges out
you could always take blur from melts or
this peachy air shade this light peach
shade you can put some of that on the
brush and just lightly graze over those
edges soften them up a bit just want it
to be nice soft and diffused it's really
simple I'm gonna go ahead and do that
for you right all right going into this
dark brown from the palette and my Smith
230 brush and I'm going to run that in
my crease and I'm also going to pick up
a flat brush like this this is the Smith
253
zip into that dark brown and just place
it right here on the outer V of the eye
and kind of just tack it down first
lightly tap it inwards and I'm tapping
it because when you put dark matte
shades like pack them onto the lid to
get a lot of intensity it's better if
you do little packing motions and then
slightly pack over into the center of
the lid it doesn't give you any like
splotchy patches you know matte shades
are a little bit harder to get nice and
touch free when you blend them like that
and you want them to be super dark I
love this brush for this because it has
a little fine point to kind of like
flick out the wing and then it has a
flat part to just really pack on shadow
my lips I think are two seconds away
from bleeding there so Drive oh I saw
some more all right so that's looking
pretty good
next I'm taking my Mac soft soft my
impact soft ochre Paint Pot on a flat
concealer brush and I'm just going to
coat that on both sides and we're going
to clean up the list-based a little bit
so that when we put on our eye shadow
for the lid it's going to look a lot
more vibrant and clean you see how that
makes the crease sharper kind of gives
like a little bit of a cut crease look
I'm really been liking this technique
because you don't have to be as precise
when you're doing the crease you could
kind of just go back in and like make it
fake the cut crease if you will I also
want to point out that if you find your
soft ochre Paint Pot or like your
painterly or whatever eyeshadow base you
use if it's a cream I'll use some derp
line drops by Inglot and I dip them in
there
so that it makes it nice and smooth
again and not as dry I also use that in
my gel liner such a great product so
don't worry too much about this blend
right here we'll fix that in a second
just make sure that you have a nice
clean line in the crease area I think I
may use this color because I've been
dying to use it so why not use it now
this is my buxom and it's called room
service so I'm just going to take that
on the same brush we were using I'm
going to start with this kind of all
the center just to see what's up you
know I don't know if I want to put it on
the whole lid yet if I just wanted to
shine in the center because it's such a
pretty like pop of color but I don't
know if I want it all over we'll see
this is so pretty
I got to meet Chris Aldridge you guys
don't know who she is she is a
phenomenal human is what she is she's a
celebrity makeup artist but she also
does YouTube videos and she was so sweet
to me oh it's just always so nice to
meet people that you really admire and
they're just amazing people I just
really loved watching her videos she is
just one of the best makeup artists she
makes everyone look beautiful her skin
and everything like she looked gorgeous
I loved her makeup she was just
everything right now I'm kind of doing
laying down the color and the next I'm
going to take this little flat brush
with the lighter eyeshadow that we first
put in the crease which is this one and
I'm going to use that to diffuse the
edges of those two colors here between
this dark brown and this nice seafoam
color we're just going to wiggle it in
between and then you can always go back
and forth until you feel like the edges
are kind of meshed together so now I'm
lightly going over and just grazing the
edges here with the seafoam shade oh man
the color I love using a flat concealer
brush to apply eyeshadow on the lid too
because you can really cut the crease
even more and it gives you like a
precise line up here the bristles aren't
as fluffy so it's just a nice crisp line
at the top give it to her man so if
anyone's going to prom this could also
be like a really pretty prom look I had
like the most basic prom dress I think I
got it at Bibi black dress that had it
was tight and had all these like pieces
of fabric draping down and I got my
makeup done at Mac for prom looking back
now I'm like whoa my makeup was actually
done really well but it was just like it
just didn't look like me I guess at the
end but the makeup was good so now I'm
gonna go into this white frosty shade
here from the palette same flat brush I
kind of cleaned it off a little bit
we're going to take some of that and I'm
going to apply it just at this inner
corner of the eye here to blend it into
the seafoam color we'll touch that up a
little bit more after we've done our
foundation and stuff next we're going to
put a little bit of mascara on the top
lashes this is a new mascara this is
lancome's once--you'll big it's too big
so I'm just going to coat my lashes with
this so that I could apply falsies for
my falsies I have these pretty dramatic
lashes think they're for lower lashes
the companies I don't know what the
style is because they are old and I have
done one them a few terms let me go
ahead and apply these there we go our
lashes are on they're going to look
pretty dramatic right now but then once
we finish the lower lash line and once
we finish the lower lash line it will be
good now I'm just going to go into my
foundation I'm going to use the clinic
beyond perfecting foundation and
concealers is like a foundation
concealer in one so it has a really full
coverage I'm in the shade golden neutral
has a little doe foot applicator so
we're just going to start applying this
all over boom-boom
I have some extractions you know they're
healing we're just cover those up clean
up any excess shadow that may have just
gone a little overboard over here now
I'm gonna take my Beauty Blender and
just blend all of that out you don't
even need or if you can see the redness
under my eyes it definitely
covers all of that up here I put most of
the product on my face and then brought
it up into my under eyes because I don't
want to I don't like to have a lot of
product on my under eye or you know
cause creasing we shall go ahead and
blend all that in so this foundation has
a natural matte finish full coverage
natural matte season see for the most
part I mean my scabs are pretty dark
from the extractions it covered you can
only just barely see them and also for
the under eyes it covered all my redness
as well and this foundation retails for
about $28 now I'm going to lightly set
the under eyes with some more Mercier
translucent powder and I'm just gonna
use my PD blender for this I don't want
to use too much here just a little bit
on the sides of my nose
and under the eye and I'm using my damp
Beauty Blender for this I want to keep
that nice moisture in there this is the
first time I've used this highlight so
this is the stargazer shade if I didn't
already say that and I'm using its the
fora fan brush you can turn your face
and see where that light naturally hit
and I'm just going to create an icy
shape so here and then take it up like a
sea boom I'm also going to take that
highlight on a pencil brush and really
just apply it as an inner corner
highlight here their eyes to make it
glow over here push up in the nose down
the bridge to make it look straight and
then on my Cupid's bow as well for my
bronzer i'll be using benefits hoola
bronzer this is just been my go-to
lately I love it I love it so much I'm
going to use just brush my japonesque
right we're just gonna pour that and
kind of hug the highway with this and
that's going to make your cheekbones pop
even more and it's also going to just
blend a lot nicer with the bronzer over
the highlight opposed to the highlight
over the bronzer because that can make
your skin look a little ashy
take this up on the forehead just
lightly like a light dust across the
forehead the reason I like hoola bronzer
is because not only is it like a nice
color for bronzer but it's also good for
contouring the nose which sometimes some
bronzers can be a little bit too warm
for an out contouring but this one I
feel like is pretty good so I'm just
going to contour like just the tip of
the nose just to kind of slim out your
parents here I'm going to take this all
the way up though for blush I'm taking
max Melba blush take that on a Mac 116
just apply it kind of on the apples this
kind of gives it a springy look with
this seafoam green and this blush so now
we can finish off the rest of our makeup
which is pretty simple we're almost just
going to mimic what we did in the crease
on the lower lash line starting off with
the transition shade that we used from
the north' palette we're just going to
go ahead and place that on the lower
lash line I'm using a dose of colors
pencil brush I like to lay down the
color first and then take a fluffier
blending brush and soften it up so
that's the first shade down now we're
going to deepen it up we're just gonna
take that darker Brown from the palette
on the outer portion of the eye like
we did at the top and blend it all out I
was thinking about taking a little bit
of this glitter this is the glam rock
glitter and just putting it a little bit
in the inner corner here of our eyes
just lightly dotting it right here into
the where you would put your inner
corner highlight just right on top there
gives it a little jazz it's going to
look really nice when the light hits
before the lower waterline I'm taking
this Vil wave a waterproof liner and
this is in glance a bronzy brown shade
and put it alone trim that along the
lower lash line so lastly I'm applying
this lip color by Too Faced this is the
melted chocolate liquefied lipstick
smells really good to the shade
chocolate honey so I feel like a nice
brown color would look really good with
this alright and that is it for this
makeup look we are done we're done we
did it yay thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next video bye soldiers women - blue -
oh just thing worse than messing up and
hitting glitter all over your face
very idea probably think it's different
