just arrived it's pretty late I'm pretty
jet-lagged from Japan but I'm very
excited and what I love most about Texas
is just the people they're so sweet so
nice a bunch of you guys came to the
airport to say hi to us and the nicest
sweetest most polite people ever I just
love everything about Texas I'm about to
go to sleep and I'm very nervous right
now because tomorrow
Stephen keeps telling me I'm gonna do
great but I'm just very nervous to do a
live transformation into Selena in a
place full of Selena fans it is a little
nerve-wracking for me but I'm so excited
and I'll never forget the day that I got
the call from Suzette Selena's sister I
died a little inside she told me that
her dad is actually the one who came
across my video and that he showed the
whole family and just thinking about
that made me it like so emotional she
said that you know you and Selena have
the same smile it was obviously Sally
knows somebody that I've looked up to
since I was four years old it's just
somebody who made me proud to be latina
and it's been a year since I've
transformed into Selena and may I just
add that the transformation was an
accident I wasn't trying to transform it
to her I just like decided like oh let
me just contour here and there and then
all of a sudden I was like wait whoa I
think it's gonna be great everybody here
here's so sweet I can't imagine anything
even if I sucked I feel like people
would still be so nice so and I can't
wait to meet all of you guys I'm gonna
go to bed I'll see you tomorrow

worst case scenario when I'm filming a
video if I mess up I'm like oh crap I
messed up let me just do that again

over but if I'm doing this live and I
messed up like what do I do you keep
going and you play with it and you be
your funny self and you say what do I
need you not funny really really I feel
like I have to channel my inner
confidence in the movie Selina when she
has to go out into the interview and
Spanish and they're like they're gonna
eat her alive it's just like I got this
that's gonna be that that scene but what
did she do she held there she crushed it

intimate and the most important to me we

thank you we'll see you soon oh my my
whole family is here
I'm Susie nice to meet you my little bit
this is April April my little chicken
yep metal chicken this is my new
accessory the big chicken would not like
Selena was like leave her room and she
freak says you know what put it up on
the towel rack in the restroom but you
took a shower
I want to get a chicken yeah I think you
share hard to clean up after how they
are they yeah very ready actually so
excited how you kill it yeah
and then we're gonna be her backup
dancers
she never seen nothing like that hot
fresh news
first of all I'm really excited about
sitting down with these beautiful Latina
ladies because I have followed your your
stories and you know where what who has
inspired you in and and I know that
you've spoken of Selena and I guess
that's really why I'm here I kind of
wanted to get a better understanding of
like how old were you when you first
discovered Selena
my first impression my first memory I
mean it was basically since I could walk
and talk you know I was born 97 I don't
mean to make anybody in here feel old my
mom was always always saying Selena oh
wait I was just so captivated by how
genuine she was like I felt like I knew
her already
you know what desi was saying yesterday
that you feel that way she doesn't feel
like somebody who's so unattainable that
like you could never be like her she
made you feel like no she can do it you
can do it exactly you know and she's
just so genuine I think it was four 4
years old I think that's how old I was
and my mom and me every time she would
come on TV we would be captivate and we
would stop everything we were doing and
just watch her on TV and to me it was
almost like oh my god like there's
somebody who looks like me who has
features like me who I can look up to
and I think that's what made her so
special for me with selena of course was
following her dream so how have you
inspired to follow your dream what
inspires you to keep your dream alive
and going because now we're in a day and
age where social media is taking over
and so many other avenues to make that
dream possible well let me tell you she
taught me that you could do anything you
want if you have a dream you just got to
go for it and work hard and even just
seeing the movie you see like how much
hard work goes into everything to get to
your dream and she worked with her
family and I work with my family my
whole team is my family
my brother my sister-in-law my husband
and we're just a little family unit and
we do everything together and we just I
mean I just take that on from from you
guys if we can kind of end up with this
I think it's very important that we
embrace our culture and who we are and
it's important for us to show women like
Selena to our young ones because she was
an important person and she represents
us completely and not just here in the
US but worldwide and I think that's
important because Lina represents a good
person she was a great person she had
good values she was all about family and
she had this amazing capability of
singing a song and just captivating us
all it's not our emotionally yeah that's
true we're connected to it I can
understand it but when I dream when I
think when I want to express and I yeah
I think in English and so my constant
struggle is like first taking what
they're saying process it translate it
then think of your answer in English and
then translate it more times and then
deliver it good and then just one thing
it's a delivery part of it
you all see the trick for me when I
start doing press like on red carpets
and stuff I would always start like if I
was thinking as like he's even all's
game
and we need that April well she named
April earn her mom did because they said
that Selena had a chicken and it was
named April it's not the sweetest thing
ever
I'm gonna cherish the little chicken for
the rest of my mama birdie tried to
steal it
come on three cannoli or not it's gonna
be like sleep with me travel with me
there's going to be a part of the story
we love you dizzy welcome to Texas desi
I absolutely adore you you are beyond
gorgeous you are the biggest influence
for all kinds of Latinas all over you're
so genuine and humble and just the
family aspect between you Steven Katy
and John seems kind of cheesy but it's
just one of those things where you just
feel really close to you I want to say
she's so humble and so are you I asked
you to take a picture outside and you
said yes and I was doing her I was like
if you takes the picture we are humble
and I think I really thank you for being
who you are thank you for being so
humble and hopefully you come back and
see us soon we love desi he loves her
tip I have everything from her like if
she comes out with whatever she comes
out i'ma buy it because I support her
100% she keeps it real she loves Selena
the way like I love something that night
a lot of people do makeup tutorials on
YouTube but I feel like the person that
I learned the most is from because she
actually tells you the reason why she's
doing things and that is why I love desi
glowy she made she made me a fan she
made me a fan I literally drove down
here at like 5:00 in the morning
everything does Aeons I own Libya you
know Fuego fire got my glasses in my
prayers oh my god oh my god I want to do
this today
