remembered as not only as an entertainer
but as a person who who cared if you
have a dream don't let anybody take it
away and you always believed that the
impossible is always possible
hola bienvenidos a my canal ah
so I'm assuming that you guys already
know what this video is all about it's
finally here I have honestly been in
love with Selena my whole life I look up
to Selena so much I've always wanted to
do this inspired makeup look by her and
then when I found out that Mac was
coming out with a collection I was like
let me just wait and see what it's all
about I was really nervous to make this
video because I honestly have like I
can't even explain why I was so nervous
I just kept telling everybody like I'm
just so nervous because I love her so
much and I don't want to I don't want to
mess it up basically after I finished
this video honestly when I looked at
myself I almost wanted to start crying
because it was just weird I don't know I
feel this really really deep connection
to Selena and you know she's such a
strong latina and she's so inspiring in
so many ways and just the one thing I
always loved about her was like her
energy her vibrant beautiful just
someone you want to be around she had
that great energy and I just loved her
laughs everything about her was
infectious so this video is like my
little tribute to her and something that
I wanted to do in memory of her I'm just
gonna get right into it
first thing I'm gonna do is fill in my
eyebrows now Selena had pretty bold
brows for most of her pictures I saw a
rounder shape you know everyone changes
their brow shape through the times but
for the most part it was round so I'm
taking ebony which is a brow powder by
honest hacia Beverly Hills and I'm just
gonna run that through the brows and try
to create a similar shape usually I want
to do really light feathery strokes but
no no no no no not today
today we're gonna go in a B so my brows
are definitely a lot thicker than
Selena's but you got to do with what you
get so for my eyeshadow base I'll be
using the Naked skin concealer just
putting a little bit of that onto my lid
taking a small Beauty Blender and
blending that into the lid
and up into the crease next I'm picking
up free spirit and I'm going to set the
brow bone and highlight the brow bone
with this and also into the crease now
I'm going to be taking missing my baby
and this is from the Selena Mac
collection it's kind of like a bone
color with a pink undertone so I'm
packing that on my brush and I'm going
to apply this all over the lid next
you're going to want to take a light
matte Brown this one is from the Tarte
palette it's called wander and I'm
taking that in a blending brush her eye
looks were super classic she really
loved just a classic eye with the black
liner or a brown smokey eye but the look
I'm going for is more of the classic
look just gonna define the crease and
the outer part of the eye with this
maybe even just like put a little bit of
the brown on the outer V but mostly into
the crease and we're not going for a
super defined cut crease just you know
throw a little definition in there so
this is the eye shadow it's super simple
she just had a nice definition I think
Tracy and of course black winged liner
so this is the liner from the Selena
collection I'm a little nervous my first
time using it so I hope I don't make any
mistakes
but my girl Selena she always had a wing
after remember not to go out as far and
make it thin you know you guys know I
like a thick wing but hers wasn't that I
paid really close attention to her wing
and like a lot of photos and she had
just like a little hmm I had to switch
to the NYC liquid liner the other one
just wasn't as dark and it was a little
bit harder for me to work with so Selena
didn't have like crazy false lashes so
I'm going to use these ones they're a
little bit more natural these are be
looks and they are by Envy if we just
look natch
you know so I'm just going to apply
mascara and then apply these lashes I'll
be using the Maybelline Spider effect
mascara this is actually like how I did
my makeup in high school tag as well I
mean this is pretty much it except I
didn't even do a shadow I just used
winged liner and that's about it I don't
even know
I filled in my brows to be honest moving
on to the face makeup I'm using the
clinic beyond perfecting foundation and
concealer in one just because this has a
really matte coverage and Selina always
had a matte look
so no highlight this might be a little
too light for me but we're just gonna
give it a go
this isn't the shade a golden neutral
just test it out before I go too crazy
here all right it's a little bit light
but that's good cuz I think Lee knows a
little bit lighter than me - yeah I
scare you
just want to make sure you're still weak
I do my forehead I got these bangs going
on with this wig
don't look at my edges they're not laid
okay for my concealer I'm going to be
using the NARS creamy concealer in
ginger I'm going to take custard and I'm
going to highlight my nose but make it
look a little bit wider like Selena's
and you don't have to do this but you
know just trying to get like a little
bit of the effect and also her nose is a
little bit longer so I'm going to take
it down here as well and blend that out
I'm going to take some Laura Mercier
translucent powder and then lightly set
the under-eye concealer I'm also going
to set the bridge of the nose with this
as well
trying to kind of create that round
shape that she had here alright I'm just
going to go ahead and dust this off and
then I'm going to contour my nose using
a Smith blending brush and some contour
powder I'm going to try to give myself a
little nose contour
so I'm taking a highlighting powder and
then also just like rounding out the tip
of my nose too so now I'm going to
contour the rest of my face using the
Salina powder and blush duo I hate to
use it you know like to actually go over
the part that says Salina here but I'm
gonna do it
she had a round her cheeks than me too
so I'm kind of gonna hold on little my
reference picture really quick though
let me set my face with powder really
quick before I play myself that's what
happened Salina was always really matte
so mattifying and setting your face with
powder is good except when your wig gets
in your face now let's try this again so
I'm going to go back into that contour
powder I'm going to use the blush it's
the tiny little blush like to actually
make my cheeks look a little bit rounder
I'm gonna go on the apples make a funny
blush face this one round mo lastly for
the eyes really quick I know that she
always has liner in her eye on the lower
lash line so I'm gonna apply that to the
outer part this is the maybelline
lasting drama pencil it's not super
heavy though so I'm just gonna apply a
little bit and then blend it out just
like that for lips I'm going to be using
Mac's Ruby woo as a lip liner I'm gonna
try to over line my lips just a little
bit just cuz she had bigger lips than me
but only right here at the top switching
gears actually picked up cherry
Ruby was a little bit more pink
undertone than I remember now I'm taking
Mac and Salina collection lipstick in
the shade go more and I'm gonna pop that
on in the center to give kind of a
glassy or finish so that they appear
fuller and that's it
alright guys so that is it for the video
I really hope that you guys enjoyed this
kind of transformation I didn't really
intend it to be like so much of her
transformation but then along the way I
was like oh let me just kinda like
contour my nose like her and stuff so I
really hope that you guys enjoyed it and
yeah this is for Selena and her family
and anybody out there who loved her just
as much as I did so thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you my
next video my bustier blue what this
week what
