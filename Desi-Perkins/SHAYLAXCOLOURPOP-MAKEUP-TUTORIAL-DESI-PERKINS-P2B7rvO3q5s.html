today's video is going to be a makeup
tutorial using the new Shayla X color
pop collection let me tell you this is
one of my favorite palettes that's come
out in a long time it's so so good I've
been using it non-stop since I got it
she came out with a full collection
there's eyes shadows she also came out
with three creamy lipsticks a really
really beautiful lip gloss and of course
some boomin highlights I'm absolutely in
love with collection I'm so proud of
Shayla
of course she is my friend and I'm
always rooting for her I know what a
perfectionist she is so it's easy to say
that she put everything into this
collection from packaging and color
choices and formulas and wore this on
snap the other day this was a super easy
makeup look to do and you guys loved it
so here we are this is a perfect look
for summer starting to get hot out there
it's just so juicy so peachy so sparkly
if you guys are interested to see what
this collection is all about to see this
makeup tutorial then keep on watching so
the first thing I'm going to do is prime
my lids I'm going to be using the
colour-pop no filter concealer I'm just
gonna apply that lid I'm using this
concealer today because I feel like my
eyelids have been super dry and this is
a little bit more hydrating then my
Tarte shape tape that I usually use for
my eyeshadow base so I'm just blending
that all in I'm actually not gonna set
my eyeshadow base today because I don't
think I did the other day when I did
this makeup look and I kind of liked how
it popped I no big surprise me not
setting my eyeshadow base now we're
gonna go into the star of the show I've
been using this ever since I got it it's
the perception palette by Shayla and her
collaboration with color pop it's
definitely been well loved by me and I
just got it I actually did a makeup look
like this the other day and you guys
just loved it so super easy this is
about to be so easy we're gonna dip into
culture and this is a beautiful
transition color I love how warm it is
just love it and I'm using
Mack two-two-four can we get a little
zoom please oh look too far
all right tapping off my brush and just
applying that into the crease we want
more of a blown-out effect and if you
see how pigmented this eyeshadow is it
literally does the job in two seconds so
I'm just gonna go ahead and buff that
through the crease next we're gonna dip
into a little bit of revenge and I'm
just gonna take a tiny bit of this same
brush and apply it in the outer part of
the eye just gonna add a little bit of
intensity to the outer corner but not
too much if you have green eyes brown
eyes I feel like these warm tones just
make your eyes stand out so much then I
just take a clean blending brush and go
over all the edges to make sure we're
nice and blend it out now I'm gonna dip
into diva and this color is so pretty I
feel like diva and struttin slay and
culture are like my three favorite
favorite colors from this palette and I
love diva because it is slightly gold
but it reflects like this really pretty
peachy undertone so I'm taking that on a
flat concealer brush and I'm just going
to apply that all over the lid and I'm
kind of carving out the crease with this
giving it a nice clean shape it's always
easier for me to apply foil to
eyeshadows either with my finger or a
flat concealer brush I think it picks up
the pigment a lot nicer and also if
you're trying to get clean lines a
concealer brush just does the trick to
really carve out the crease then I go
back in to a little bit of culture on a
blending brush and just soften the edges
of it cause like I said I want it to be
clean but I don't want it to be like cut
crease you want to be nice and soft
blown out as you get to the outer corner
where we applied the revenge color you
just want to tap the foiled shade into
that so kind of merging them together
but not in a harsh line just nice
tapping motions honestly it looks like
the backdrop but it looks like my eyes
are glowing but it's just the eye shadow
now that we've laid that down I went
into tea
which is obviously I'm going to take a
little bit of that eye shadow onto the
same concealer brush right at the peak
of where my eyeball sits in my socket
I'm gonna press this into that area just
to lightly brighten it up it's not gonna
do anything super dramatic but when the
light hits it's gonna just look more
accentuated again my blending brush just
soften out the edges see how it just
catches the light
like right in that area it looks really
pretty small little step you just want
to Pat it on but it has a really nice
impact on the eyelid this for like a
summer party are you kidding me mmm shut
it down okay lastly sometimes I like to
go in with a bone color I just like to
pop it right here on the highest part of
the brow bone and then whatever's left
over under your brush just kind of fade
it into the edges I'm gonna be using the
maybelline superstay 24-hour foundation
and I think I'm gonna mix two colors 220
and a little bit of 310 mix it up on my
little mixing pad I just like to apply
my foundation sometimes with a brush and
then blend it with a Beauty Blender
because I feel like it disperses the
product without soaking it up a little
bit better now going into my concealer
I'm gonna be using my Becca alpha
luminous concealer in beige then I'm
gonna take a little bit of my Tarte
shape tape and I just like to apply this
just here like where your hollows would
be because I feel like covers really
well right there and then I'm also gonna
take this and start to highlight the
bridge of my nose and then I like to do
the chin usual places
music again concealers but I also like
to take the color pop concealer because
I feel like it has a little bit of I'm
golden undertones and it cancels out
just this little darkness I have in the
corner here yep yep yep yep
then we're to take our Beauty Blender
and blend it all
like it didn't really work on my outer
corner that colour-pop one let me try
the Kim K one this foundation is
definitely like very very matte it does
cover everything but I feel like if
you're dry might be a little tight you
know all right now I'm just gonna go
ahead and blend this out if it isn't
already dry you don't want to let your
concealer sit anywhere too long because
then it dries and then you're kind of
just like oh and I'm gonna take my
Laura Mercier translucent powder and
just apply that a small amount on the
under eyes on the sides of the nose just
a little bit let that sit for a minute
and I also like to take a little bit of
Laura Mercier powder onto Mac 116 and
I'm just gonna press that into the
center of my forehead lightly and then
also just right here block lines and
there's something about Laura Mercier
powder that just like softens pores so I
always just like pack it into my apples
of my cheeks so now we got to put the
life back into her face with some
bronzer I'm gonna be using the Marc
Jacobs bronzer and this is a 104
tantastic again like I want everything
to be really really smoked out defuse
not super light so I'm taking this giant
hourglass brush cuz it's nice and fluffy
it doesn't have a name on it it's just
like a dual ended brush I'm gonna swirl
it into the bronzer and then I'm gonna
start over here swirling motions around
the perimeters of my face and I always
start off with a small amount because
bronzer helmet you understand don't want
that now we are gonna hit up some blush
this is one of the new melt cosmetics
blushes and this is in the shade sundown
I mean it's like the perfect color I
love these types of colors because
they're in between like a peach and a
bronze so if you're going for more of an
overall bronzy look it's not
to be to blushy it's gonna kind of just
fuse with the bronzer I'm gonna use the
same brush these blushes are really
pretty they have a slight sheen to them
so it just gives you that nice like
sunny glowy look sometimes I even like
to hit whatever is left over on my blush
brush my forehead and like across the
nose let me take off this powder first
under my eyes before I apply highlight
now take a little bit of fix+
and I'm gonna be using the new fix plus
with gold light a little shaker in there
shake it up alright so I'm gonna be
taking a Shayla X color pop highlight
and this is in the shade boom in this is
the lighter of the two highlights in her
collection and the darker the darker
shade is called pose so if you have a
deeper complexion that would be really
pretty but this one's also really pretty
for the deep complexions too so I'm
taking a little bit on a more feet r36
brush I'm just gonna lightly apply this
highlight on the tops of my cheekbones
so this highlight is what it says it's
definitely boom in because it's a little
bit bronze ear for me I like to go in
with a light hand and just kind of use
it with my bronzer and my blush mm-hmm
take a little bit of that down the
center of my nose
tip of the nose just a little bit so I'm
going back into the perception palette
and I'm just gonna take the matte
shadows that I used in the crease and
apply them on the lower lash line and
just nice cloudy smoke for use for that
I'm gonna be using the morphe 36 brush
and I'm going into culture again which
is that nice transition shade and I'm
gonna start with that on the lower lash
line and build that up first now I'm
just taking a little bit of revenge
which is that rusty Brown red color and
I'm gonna apply that just on the outer V
of the eye like we did at the top but
just now on the bottom and kind of
connecting the corners together for the
inner corner I'm gonna go ahead and mix
struttin slay but mostly spilled the tea
because I want that
lightness but I like the undertone of
this color we're gonna apply that in the
inner tear-duct here
games like that nice pink peachy color
next I'm taking the Urban Decay 24/7
glide on pencil misses in bourbon and
I'm lightly just applying that really
close to the lash line not a wing or
anything just along the lashes this is
good to hide like your lash band and
also just make your lashes look a little
thicker I'm gonna go ahead and use the
Maybelline X shameless bigshot mascara
in blackest black or badass black sorry
and I'm just gonna lightly coat my
lashes with this to prep my lashes for
the falsies falsies I'm gonna be using
my iconic light lashes I just love these
especially for a daytime look they're so
fluttery pretty and I've already worn
these so I'm like they're primed for my
eyeball they're ready to go
instant drama now that lashes are on I'm
gonna do my lower mascara this is the
Mac extended play I'm just gonna lightly
apply that for my lips I'm gonna do a
mixture of ooh and quickie and then of
course I'm gonna use the lip gloss which
is neat freak and this lip gloss is
super pretty first I'm going into
and then on top of that more towards the
center I'm going to be using quickie
which is a really nice light nude really
carpet in the center there mm-hmm and
then on top of that I'm gonna use
neat-freak which is a peachy champagne
lip gloss and it has shimmer it's really
pretty alright guys so this is the
finished makeup look I really hope you
