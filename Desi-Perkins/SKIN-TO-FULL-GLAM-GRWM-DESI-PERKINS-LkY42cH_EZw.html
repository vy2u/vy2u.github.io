for today's video you're gonna be
getting ready with me okay I have a
night out and I wanted to film I get
ready please me we're gonna be doing
this makeup look which I'm loving okay
cool chums I did it for you guys and not
only that but I'm also gonna be showing
you guys my skin prep how to get it
right and tight snatch
looking flawless before makeup
application so that your makeup looks
the best it could possibly look you guys
already know how much I love that EULA
Henriksen toner this is like a holy
grail for me especially if you have oily
skin if you have breakouts and they've
noticed how much I loved it so we're
partnering for this video so I can show
you guys some of their other skincare
stuff that is bomb including this in the
routine their new masks and all the
skincare that everybody's talking about
their under-eye cream which is like a
hit on social media and also their new
moisturizer so if you guys are
interested in this video and then keep
on watching so anytime I have an event I
really feel like I want to give my skin
major prep to make sure my makeup lasts
that my skin looks smoother that my
pores look smaller
you understand I like to feel like I'm
having a spa day at home so I'm gonna be
using that Lila Hendrickson and this is
the cold plunge pore mask this mask is
super fun because it's bright blue and
it just feels nice and cooling well
usually I just take a little bit on the
back of my hand
boom so I'm gonna take the little brush
then we're gonna go ahead and apply this
look how blue it is Stephen and I were
masking with this the other day
every time I put this mask on that's the
song that comes in my head I switched my
brush up here because I like to get
right into the cheek area nice and dense
what this mask is gonna do is make your
pores look nice and small they're gonna
appear smaller you are gonna have a
smoother base for makeup application
that's really what's key about this it
does combat oils so if you tend to get
slick throughout the night especially
when you put foundation on this is gonna
help reduce the oil so now what you do
is you leave the mask on for 15 minutes
and just kind of do what you do
all right so next with skincare I'm
gonna go ahead and tone my skin you guys
know how important toner has become to
me this is my favorite toner it's the LA
Henriksen balancing force oil control
toner love this stuff and really helps
me with breakouts I've been using it
forever now I take a little bit on a pod
and I'm just gonna run that over my skin
and I really just dab it into the parts
where I have breakouts or you know and
also if you have oily skin around the
nose area toner helps with that this
stuff has a really nice cooling feeling
too but you guys know this I've used it
so many times now I'm gonna go in with
some eye cream using the hoola Heinrichs
and this is the banana eye cream banana
bright eye so I just take a little bit
of that and then you always want to use
this finger your ring finger to apply
your under eye cream and basically it's
the weakest of the fingers okay it has
the lightest touch then I'm gonna go
ahead and apply some moisturizer because
you have to apply moisturizer before
foundation just let it sink in sometimes
when I'm feeling bougie I just use a
foundation brush to apply my moisturizer
because again I like to feel that
at-home spa experience and this is the C
rush brightening gel alright so our skin
is prepped now it's time to go into the
makeup I'm going for more like cool
tones you heard it here first cool tones
we're gonna start on the eye makeup so
can I get a little zone boom boom okay
we're gonna start by priming the lids
I'm gonna be using just this color pop
concealer just like to shake my Beauty
Blender do a nice light layer this is in
the shade medium tan and I'm gonna go in
with a shadow stick this one is by Laura
Mercier and it's called
cobblestone all over the eye kind of
building the shape that you want
after you apply that just take your
blending brush and just work that into
the crease and then I'm gonna build it
up one more time blend it out now I'm
gonna be using the new whoo WD rose gold
palette I'm gonna go into this color
suade right over here this is the
perfect color for the look it's also
along with the black the only cool toned
color in this palette oh here like
searching for cool tones like because
you know I don't have them like that
taking one of my favorite brushes Mac -
- for when we are gonna start smoking
out the crease it's such a pretty
eyeshadow I'm kind of creating the shape
first and then I go in and blend it I'm
gonna take a smaller blending brush with
the same color focusing it on the outer
part of the eye here boom boom pow and
don't worry about the lid we're gonna
apply a different color so now we're
gonna dip into this bone color this is
just from the matte metals cat lobby you
could use any bone color I'm just gonna
pop this at the highest point of the
brow bone just blend it for the lid I'm
gonna use something a little sparkly
because it's a night out I'll be using
the dose of color single shadow in the
shade slinky and you just start patting
it in I like to use my fingers with any
shimmers and you just gotta build it up
thinking about going to Vegas soon guys
it's been a minute since I've been back
in my heyday when I was out fountain and
boppin I'm taking a concealer brush just
to get closer to the edges and blending
it out you wouldn't really need to do
this if you didn't have nails but I
sometimes I find with nails it gets in
the way of my precision anyways what I
was saying this is a perfect look for
Vegas and I'm thinking about going to
Vegas soon it's been a minute I remember
the last time I went to Vegas I was like
I'm done with Vegas it's not for me I'm
not going back and now I'm kind of like
I'm ready I forgot all the negative and
now I'm thinking about was the positive
like my bachelorette party there Oh such
a good time such a good time we were
just wild and reckless we were taking
maybe I'll do a storytime my
bachelorette party I've applied some of
the block party shadow now I'm going
back into my crease with a little bit
more of the suede matte shadow it's all
coming together now the cool tones
always scare me and then once I see it
coming together I'm like oh yes we've
arrived all right we're looking good
we're looking right and tight I'm gonna
go ahead and do the same thing to the
other eye jumping back into the skin now
that our skin
settled in I'm going to be using the
Charlotte Tilbury flawless filter this
is kind of like a liquid glow product
there's different colors this one's
three I'm using it more as a highlight
for today but there's different colors
you could use it instead of foundation
and just put it all over the skin which
is nice I want my skin to be extra pop
in so now I'm just gonna go ahead and
push that into the face this is just a
little more skin prep before we dip into
our foundation using the Lancome 410
shade and I'm just gonna apply that with
my blender pressing the foundation into
the skin here I want to add a little bit
of black to the makeup look before I put
my concealer on so I'm picking up the
black and the huda beauty palette this
is black truffle onto a Smith to 5/3
brush and I'm gonna add that to kind of
the wing area the outer lash line and
you want to do this before concealer
because sometimes you can have some
fallout you know also kind of gives your
lashes like a little bit of a lift and
you want to be snatched I'm gonna go
ahead and apply some concealer get the
sides of the nose real good you want to
blend that in with the beauty blender
there's nothing like applying concealer
and just seeing how much life I feel
like I get after it brightens me up a
little bit the Becca concealer is
lightweight so nice especially for
everyday but when I want to kick up my
concealer up a notch I take a little bit
of the Tarte shape shape especially on
the sides of the nose where I want to
like conceal any shadowing and then I'm
gonna use this to highlight the nose and
the forehead mm-hmm I feel like I was
like I'm just gonna apply a little
concealer two seconds later I'm like
look at all this concealer on my face
I just want to press it in on these
corners here I don't want to blend out
too much because I want to make sure
that my pigmentation stays covered
mmm-hmm there we go
blending out the chin always save the
nose for last I feel like I'm so
aggressive with my Beauty Blender
I'm like pounding the makeup into my
face I need to be more gentle we got the
new Marc Jacobs finish line 34 invisible
powders I think this has a little bit
more color it's not super translucent
though this sifter you know what I
really like I don't need that there I
just want to dip it in okay we're gonna
let that sit for a minute and since
we're here with the powder I'm just
gonna take a little bit of that see with
a powder brush it's really nice to have
that I'm just gonna set the rest of my
face telling you skin care matters
feeling pretty smooth while that's
sitting I'm gonna go ahead and finish
off at the lower lash line of the eyes
or just the eyes in general I'm gonna
pick up a black kohl liner this is the
urban decay and we're gonna just apply
that on the inside of the eye the
waterline and then right here on the
outer corner and just feathering it in
make sure you tight line up up and heal
that's good for now and I'm just gonna
take a nice pencil brush we're gonna
blend that out so I started working out
again it's miserable I mean every
morning I think today gonna be the day I
wake up and I like to do this or not I
see people out there like oh my god I
love my workout it's so fun I feel so
great and I'm just here like no I don't
feel any of that okay I do not feel any
of that yet maybe I'll get there but so
far it's not where I'm at personally I'm
out there dying I'm looking like one of
those noodles at the gas station you
know those things that just flail in the
wind all right then I'm gonna go back
into suede which is the color we used in
the crease taking that on a pencil brush
I'm gonna smoke out the black liner just
a tiny bit just right along the edge you
know who's under ice smokiness I love
Laura from milk cosmetics or like Jamie
Genevieve I love like the smokiness of
how they do their lower lash lines just
everything I'm gonna go back into this
powder the Marc Jacobs powder and I'm
going to apply that down the bridge of
my nose I should have done that earlier
but I just foga so I'm gonna keep the
powder on until we have the lashes and
ever
all stuns I'm gonna let it sit there for
a minute dipping into a little bit of
bronzer also using the Marc Jacobs
bronzer this is fantastic
just apply them on all over make my
forehead look a little smaller now I'm
gonna pick up this matte blush this is
copper tone not too warm not too cool
it's just like a nice neutral color I'm
just gonna use that to take off the
powder on my nose before we apply
highlight or anything to the skin we
want to use some setting spray this is
gonna make sure that all the power oh I
just realized I didn't dust the powder
off under my eyes and I said it oh I
think I got most of it off but don't do
that
that's not good mmm while that is
sitting let's go ahead and pop on some
lashes I'm gonna use these from huda
beauty and they are in the style Jade
number 13 I'm gonna go put these on I'll
be right back for a highlight i'm gonna
be using way go this is the
collaboration that Katie and I did with
Joseph colors right now it's time to
glow okay I'm gonna start off with a
little and then you just want to fan it
out glossy fan and over here in the
temple I'm also gonna take that down the
center of the nose tip of the nose and
the Cupid's bow I'm also gonna take a
little bit of the fuego highlight and
pop that right in the inner corner then
just soften it all I like to go over
with my Beauty Blender just to make sure
it's nice and melted into the skin for
lipstick you know what lip liner I've
been loving lately guys that la girl lip
liners bomb all the new colors I've been
using this one which is café's I feel
like their formulas really nice to build
up the lip line if you want to over over
draw it just lightly lining the lips
here and then for lipstick this is the
Inglot and JLo lipstick in the shade
213 so I'm just gonna top this on it's
really
Matt kind of blending the lipliner with
the lipstick it's a nude color but it
has a little bit of a rosy undertone
which I like so that is it
I am ready intercepts go put a different
outfit on because this rope got me
feeling some type of way I'll be right
back
so I just changed into this top because
I feel like how much does it match my
eyes you see what I did there you see
