associated video is going to be a
skincare video since my last game care
video I have pretty much switched
everything out except for one item my
skin was having some issues for some
months in 2016 I couldn't figure out
what was happening I had no idea what it
was
so I actually decided to just start over
and dump everything I was using before
and just try new products these are all
things that I just started trying with
in the last 3 months and they've been
working amazing for me so I just wanted
to share those things with you guys
obviously there's like a lot of items
that I love skincare there's a lot of
different masks I love but these are
just what I've been using to get my skin
to kind of normal out to now let's go
ahead and install it let's start was
talking about my skin type I have normal
to combination skin type which means
like I'm pretty normal everywhere on my
face except my t-zone gets very oily
throughout the day when you have that
kind of situation I guess you could use
toner on your oily parts Taylor helps
with oil control I don't really use a
toner I'm sure it would help me in the
nose section I kind of just powder my
nose when I get oily and as far as
facials
I've gotten a bunch of different facials
but I feel like what really helped me
from the beginning of my skin issues to
now was getting extractions
I understand extractions to be really
terrifying but if they're done right
it's actually really good it clears
everything out of your skin so I could
feel all the bumps under my skin when I
was washing my face now it's more of a
smooth texture and I don't feel those
bumps under the skin anymore because
they were all extracted out kind of gave
me like a brand new canvas I still get
the extractions every time I get a
facial with Yoli I'll put her Instagram
down below she just cleans everything
out and it can be scary for my first day
that it happens but it's been really
worth it for me so those are just some
things that I've been doing first off
we're going to talk about what I use to
remove my makeup jars Aban calm makeup
wipe Kirkland Costco brand best makeup
wipes ever the daily facial towelette
not only are they amazing because they
work really well but they're so cheap
it's $12 for 150 make a point
I actually prefer these to the
Neutrogena was because the Neutrogena
ones tend to have a little bit more oil
than these these are really good for
sensitive skin and they're also thicker
white if you have the Neutrogena ones as
well over here on the side sidekick over
here
but I only use them if I run out of
these however I do really love the
Neutrogena oil-free eye makeup remover
this is what I use with the q-tip on my
eyes to remove my mascara
it makes the mascara too bitch basically
you know it's like really waterproof
Inglot gel liner you just use a little
bit and it all dissolves off the eyes
super easy you don't want to use a lot
of makeup wipes to like rub your eye
because it's so sensitive under this
area and you can create more wrinkles
that way I like to use this when I have
hardcore makeup on it's really really
good
oil-free so if you have eyelash
extensions this is a good makeup remover
this is the reason why I got it when I
did the eyelash extensions before I
couldn't use oil around my eyes so I
picked this up and it was really good so
I became with it so now that we've
covered makeup removal process let's
move on to face wash right after
removing all my makeup I cleanse my face
this is the juice speedy boil cleanser
and this is something that has kind of
stayed with me for I don't know it's
been a while has it been like 1 to 2
years I love this this is the only thing
that has stayed in my skincare when I
stopped using this was when my skin was
acting up I started trying out other
face washes because I ran out so I was
trying other things my skin still wasn't
clearing up I decided to go back to this
this product is supposed to help right
and then even your skin tone it's
supposed to help with impurities your
breakouts if you have any clogged pores
things like this and it is an oil
product and I know a lot of people who
have oily skin or afraid to use oil
products it's still okay for you to use
this even if your skin is oily so what
you do is you take a small amount of the
oil onto your dry hands and you start to
massage it into your face it really
helps to move makeup that's left over so
you just want to keep going in upward
circular motions with this product and
then as you have kind of hit the whole
surface area you can wet your fingertips
massage it in a little bit more get your
neck area and then you just rinse it off
with warm water and you pot your face
dry super easy it's like that extra step
to make sure all your makeup is gone as
well because the oil really breaks down
everything on your skin so the next
thing I do is apply this product and
this is the SK 2 facial treatment
essence it is in essence water the
reason I started using it is because SK
2 had reached out to me I like to try
skin care
because you never know they might not
work for me or they might give me a
reaction I tried it out for about a
month and a half and I ended up really
really liking it it's a water that is
supposed to help with the renewal of
your skin so that helps with fine lines
it helps with texture and it also helps
your skin glow and give you moisture and
all I do with this is I put like four
drops in my hands and I Pat it into my
skin your forehead your neck
I also dab it under my eyes because I'm
always concerned about the under eye
area so I always have that under the
skin and you know to be honest with you
guys it's so hard to tell you which one
of these products in particular is
responsible for my skin clearing up I
think it's a combination of everything I
really do feel like my skin texture
itself and pigmentation has gotten a lot
better because I did have a lot of
pigmentation from the breakouts that I
had even though they went away I still
have the marks I think because this
helps with the renewal of your skin
cycles that it kind of just went away
faster I really really like that product
and I think it's working for me moving
on to Chartres this is something that
I've been absolutely loving it's the
drink of h2o by Tarte cosmetics this
product is so so good if you have dry
skin not only does it quench your face
it literally makes your face glow
afterwards actually right now I'm
wearing concealer and highlight but I
don't have foundation I'm trying to wear
less like overall foundation on my skin
and when I put this on my face it looks
like your face is drink a glass of water
it looks so luminous I actually got
complimented by the waiter at Denny's
the other day like what do you have on
your skin and it was just this
moisturizers so this stuff is really
good like I said to hydrate your skin
it's a hydration boost drink of h2o all
of that hydration I love that like
really glowy look so this is just what
I've been using for my overall face and
my under eyes and I'm not sure if that's
good or bad but in my like last three
months I've noticed my skin always looks
really hydrated and my under eyes have
looked a lot better when I've set my
makeup with powder so I don't feel like
it's done anything bad if anything it's
been looking better this stuff the bomb
calm this is the next item and I know it
may seem strange because you know
like really this is important
preventative don't forget about your
neck situation this is the juice beauty
stem cellular I cannot know why some
want me to say that stem
cellular listing next cream improves the
appearance of wrinkles in elasticity you
guys can't be forgetting about your neck
I know a lot of people out there like
you're younger I get it you're not
worried about that kind of stuff yet
trust me and I know because I used to
like do things my mom would say don't do
that it's going to be wrinkled and then
I was like whatever then I started to
get wrinkles in those areas and I was
like oh should I show this into my mom
so I'm telling you you should always
bring your products down to your neck
your neck Ages very easily it's a very
thin skin and I feel like that's how you
can tell age on like a lot of people
your hands as well so you want to make
sure to bring products down there this
is just something my mom she actually
stole this from me and I was like oh
yeah I guess I don't need a neck cream
just take it so she took it and she said
that it has really changed her neck and
it's been helping her so much so I was
like okay well I might as well just use
it too so I've been using this as well
on my neck
in hopes that it'll stay fresh my mom
approved that I can say for sure like I
mentioned to you guys I haven't really
been using under eye creams I've kind of
just been using the h2o all over within
the last week I started using the
Charlotte Tilbury this is the magic eye
rescue I just started using this I still
don't really have an opinion on it yet I
do know that it hasn't clogged my under
eyes usually I noticed that I don't like
an eye cream a right away when they clog
my under eyes and give me the little
Millia bumps is that a zit get those
little white bumps so I'm always like
really really cautious when I try under
eye creams so far I haven't done that
it's only been a week if you guys have
tried this under eye cream and it's
worked for you let me know still testing
but I just thought I'd throw it in
because who knows I might end up loving
it as far as sun block really quickly
I'll touch on sunblock
I'm not like super picky I do like this
one it's from Target I've used it before
it's the SPF 30 bear republic natural
mineral sunscreen and the only reason I
like this one is because it stays pretty
matte it doesn't get really greasy I
don't like some blocks that make your
skin feel more oily especially because I
tend to get oily years nothing super
but this is the sunblock that I use if
anyone's interested we're moving on to
blemishes things that I used to spot
treat I was using Mario Badescu I
stopped kind of using that when I
stopped all my other skincare because
nothing was working for my skin all of a
sudden was really annoying so my
esthetician she told me like to use tea
tree oil every time somebody recommends
something to me I always do my research
on those products as should you if I'm
recommending something to you you should
always research it because you just
never know how it would react to your
skin right so you want to make sure to
do your own research so she used tea
tree oil on my extractions after she
cleans them out she told me like if you
get a break out just use a little bit of
tea tree oil and it'll go away on its
own
you don't have to pinch your skin and
like try to poke at it I did start to
use the tea tree oil but like I was
saying I've read reviews some people
saying that it doesn't work for them or
they'll say that it gave them a breakout
I decided to test it out anyways and
take the risk this is a tea tree oil
that I got it's 100% Australian tea tree
oil desert essence tea tree oil is also
very very strong what I do is I
basically wet a few tips so I get all
the water in there and then I dip it
really quickly into the tea tree oil and
I dab just q-tip over any blemish that I
have and I do that at night I go to
sleep I wake up and I swear to you the
blemish it's like way smaller than it
was the day before it dries it out
really quickly without making your skin
look gross and like flaky and peely I
just put it on the spot I don't put it
all over my face I know some people use
it like even like as a toner I don't do
that it's too harsh and it has changed
the game for me as far as breakouts
they go away a lot quicker I can't tell
you guys the last time I've had to like
really really pick at my face I used to
do that every time I got a breakout now
I just use the tea tree oil and it just
goes away really quick on its own magic
in a bottle for me but like I said test
it out there's like 50 50 reviews on it
but I I knew that it was okay for me
because she used it on my face and it
was totally fine so there you go all
right so now let's talk about mess now I
use a lot of different masks I've been
kind of sticking to the same type of
mask for the last three months of course
I test masks here and there I use
different ones but
I'm only going off of what I've been
using constantly that is first of all
the glam glow this is the gravity mud
mask then I first saw people using this
mask I thought it was like kind of
gimmicky and I just didn't really ever
pick it up too often I'd like just used
it a couple of times then I started
using it purely because I liked to peel
it off because for me it was like a fun
experience to peel it off I do it all
the time on snapchat and so I started
using it because of that really and I
had it might as well just use it I
noticed my skin looked really nice
afterwards it gave it like a really nice
glow mentally to me I don't know if it
was like tightening my pores but I do
feel like my pores have gotten a little
bit tighter I don't know I really love
this mask I've gone through two bottles
of this already because I use it heavy
like I use it a lot if you guys watch me
at snapchat I've been wearing it all the
time and when it comes to masks like
these like firming masks or hydrating
masks I feel like you could use them a
lot more often than say for example a
charcoal mask or something that's a lot
more harsh that can dry out your skin if
it's hydrating or firming I feel like
I'll use it all the time but if it's a
harsher mouth try not to use it too
often so this is something that I've
been using all the time I love it it's
it's I don't know I can't I don't know
you guys I don't a lot of I know a lot
of youtubers use it and that's because
glam descends a lot of stuff to
youtubers but I'm like I'm not this
isn't sponsored or anything
they've never sponsored like my snaps or
anything that's all purely me loving to
peel this mask and it also making my
skin glow I don't think it helps a lot
with like breakouts or anything like
that so I think it's mostly just firming
giving you a nice glow it also comes
with this little brush applicator so you
can give yourself a nice even layer and
you can keep the container clean you
just wash the brush after you use it and
that way you don't have to be using your
hands you know I had already applied all
my skincare this morning so I decided to
show you guys a little demo of Steven my
model using the mask
so you guys could see how cool it looks
it looks like The Tin Man ready I got to
hit you with this one time ha ha
yes he's loving it he's loving it now
we're going to move on to
Sheetz mask this is also something
that's actually a hobby of mine is
supplying a sheet mask I'm super
obsessed with them I like the ones that
are for hydration you see like a pattern
here everything is hydration firming or
writing those are the ones I kind of
look for when I pick up sheet masks a
lot of people ask me which ones they
should get if I were to only have to use
a sheet mask for the rest of my life I
love the ones that have the more jelly
texture so like Lancome I love their
sheet masks and Tasha I love their sheet
masks as well but really go to Sephora
or wherever and pick up any sheet masks
for whatever problem you're trying to
combat so they have them for redness
dryness breakouts wrinkles they have all
different kinds but I wear any one that
I pick up and I love them because they
are so luxurious they make you feel
expensive like you're at the spa you're
paying for the Spotted but you're really
just at home using these sheet masks
everything about them is magical to me
I'm like a huge fan I use probably one
every day no life no life I did try out
the Charlotte Tilbury one she's coming
out with a new one and I don't I don't
really know how I feel about it but let
me be honest I have a really big phobia
of cotton it's a dry sheet mask and for
me it's like more of a texture issue
where I was kind of making me feel
uncomfortable because I have the phobia
of cotton so people were asking me how I
felt and I'm like I'm not really sure
because I think it being my skin with
Polish it looked nice but for me because
of my phobia it made me a little
uncomfortable so I don't know you're
gonna some buddy else will have to
review that that hasn't doesn't have my
issue but yes so sheet masks the balm
these ones are just random this one
helps control oil and soothe irritated
skin tightens pores so maybe if you went
on in on your face and it's all red you
want to use a sheet mask this one is for
elasticity and volume of your skin
maybe you drink the night before you
turn too hard this one might be good for
that these ones are for radiance
moisture and just like giving your skin
a boost so this one's always good for me
every day those are pretty much the
masks I've been using like I said you
guys I always use different matte lastly
for maps I have these under eye patches
I put these in the refrigerator these
are the tart pack your bag under eye
rescue these are really good if you
swell in the morning
for me I wake up and I'm always really
puffy like my eyelids my undereyes and
so for me I'm putting them in the
refrigerator and then placing them under
my eyes really helps calm it down faster
if you have to be somewhere quick and
you don't have time to do puffs
naturally that's what this really helps
me for other than that I don't really
like see anything else coming from that
but for me it really helps even out my
under eye as in like the puffiness of it
I wasn't really too sure if I should add
this in the video this is something I
use when I don't wear foundation and I
love how it makes my skin look it's the
Mac strobe cream and this is in the
shade gold light it's one of their new
strobe cream it kind of just gives you a
really nice like lit up blue on your
face without having to use any makeup
products some moisturizer it looks
beautiful on the skin I just thought I
would include this you can also use it
under your makeup to get like a really
nice radiant look lastly for my skincare
I pretty much have just this boring
chapstick this is not the container it
comes in it comes in like a little
regular chapstick tube it's Tamira it's
soothing scandalous and cuticle care
it's really really good if you get dry
ass lips which I do all the time
something that I put on when I go to bed
because my lips tend to get really dry
especially if you have the heater on at
night it protects your lips overnight
from getting super shriveled up and
gross I also wear it when I go to the
gym because it gives you kind of a
glossy look and it hydrates your lips
it's just my favorite lip treatment at
the moment and I've been using it for a
really long time I think that's the last
product I have here
that's everything if I were to chalk it
down to four things that are my die hard
skincare right now it would be these for
cleansing oil chart h2o the teacher goal
for breakout and SK 2 essence water
every single day without a doubt this is
like my skincare routine and everything
else is kind of like extra stuff you
know things that you used to remove your
makeup mask things like that but that's
the army right there that's all my
skincare that I've been using lately let
me know you guys think of these products
that you've tried any of them especially
the under eye cream I'm really curious
to see if any of you guys have tried
that Charlotte Tilbury cream and you're
liking it just because I just started
using it also I have a video coming out
next week on the no no foundation
dewy skin looks that have kind of been
wearing recently so that's going to be
coming out and I think that's everything
so I'll see you guys in my next video
