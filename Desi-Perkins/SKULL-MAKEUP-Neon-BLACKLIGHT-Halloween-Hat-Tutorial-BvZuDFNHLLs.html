tutorial so today we're gonna be doing a
neon skull but in order for it to be
black light everywhere you go you need
to make a hat so here I have asked yes
these are his hands he's going to be
making the Hat for us you need a hat
some led rope light a screwdriver a
female adapter and a glue gun also a
wire cutter so first you want to split
the ends and you're going to connect the
positive to the positive and the
negative to the negative
- the female adapter yes Jeff then
you're going to take the screwdriver
tighten that up good to go just showing
that when you plug it in to the battery
pack it will light up so unroll pit
there's actually a sticky adhesive that
you could take off to lay down the LED
rope light however I recommend using a
little bit of hot glue to really really
secure the lights down if you want your
neon light to be brighter
I suggest laying down at least two rows
of these lights however we only did one
I don't know why but then you're going
to go ahead and cut the end there's
marks where you're allowed to cut the
wire and then you're good to go boom you
got your LED backlight hatch alright so
now we're going to get started with the
makeup I first popped in these Gracie
contacts these are from desi Oh eyes
next I am taking my NYX wonder pencil
which is perfect to outline the rough
shape of your skeletal face because if
you make mistakes you can wipe it away
in two seconds I did a couple times not
gonna lie but you want to look at
pictures for reference so that you can
get an accurate
face shape skeletal shape whatever I'm
trying to say I actually looked at
Krispies video from last year she did a
skeleton that was really really good so
I actually referenced her photo next I'm
gonna start laying down color with the
makeup forever flash palette I'm
randomly picking up colors this is the
aqua shade in the palette and I'm just
going to start blending them on to my
face
these cream colors are so easy to blend
you can really use a sponge a brush
whatever you have and just start kind of
blending them together
I had no pattern in which I was placing
the colors you can place them however
you want so I'm just going in and
putting down all the shades if you
didn't want to make this neon and you
just wanted to make the colorful skull
you could use this and only this and it
would be perfect so I take a smaller
brush for smaller areas and then go back
in to the Sigma 3d concealer kabuki
brush to blend in the rest and we're
pretty much just going to keep doing
this until we have all the skull part
that's not hollow laid down next I'm
picking up the black and the palette on
a tart liner brush and I'm just gonna
start outlining all the areas of the
skeleton that are hollow and are going
to be filled in black this is just going
to make it easier for me so that
everything doesn't get lost and also so
that you guys can really see where
everything is going to go I want to warn
you guys right now that I am a little
bit all over the place in this video
just because when I do something more on
the creative side I hop around all over
the place
take a liner and line your waterline
because we want that to be super black
and then I'm taking black face paint
this is mehron black face paint and I'm
going to fill in the eye sockets the
reason I'm using the mehron black face
paint is because I find that the makeup
from flash palette on my eyelids
tends to crease even if I set it I think
just creases on my lid so I'm using a
face paint for this area and you guys
are going to see that this also creases
but once you set it with black eyeshadow
later it will stay put
I'm also as you guys can see filling in
my ears I'm going to be filling in my
neck my nose pretty much I'm going to be
filling in everything by the end of this
video
so for the mouth area as you guys can
see here I'm picking up colors from the
flash palette and I'm going to start
swiping different colors in a vertical
pattern around the mouth I want these to
mimic the lines that come up from the
teeth so the shading and I want the
teeth to fade into a bunch of different
colors so that's what I'm doing there
and then going ahead and finishing off
the rest of the skeleton face that I
didn't earlier so I'm really excited
about this because this is the makeup
forever black light pigment black light
pigment I found was so much easier to
work with than black light paint only
because black light paint can be really
streaky if you're not under black light
and these look good even when you're in
normal lighting so what I'm doing here
is setting every color with its
corresponding black light pigment so
blue with blue yellow with yellow you
understand and this is a first time
trial using these pigments for me so if
you guys can see here eyes on patting
the pigment in I kind of wanted that
like patchy artistic look but then when
I put it under black light
it just looked patchy so what I did was
I patted the pigment in just to make
sure I got enough color payoff and then
after I went in and smooth it all out
just like you would blend normal
eyeshadow because you want it to look
really seamless so now I'm going back
into that pixie black liner and I'm just
going to start frowning as hard as I can
so that I can mimic those frown lines
around the forehead and then I'm taking
a brush to kind of feather them out
blend away going back into the black
face paint and creating cracks all along
my skull shading around the temple I'm
also going to do some shading around the
jaw and with this I'm actually using
black eye shadow just because I found it
was a little bit easier for me to do
and since I have the black eyeshadow out
I'm also going to set those lids because
as you guys can see they are creasing
really badly you always want to make
sure to set them so I'm using black
eyeshadow because that is not cute
moving on to the teeth
so with skeletal teeth I found it easier
for me at least to place down white
first previously when I've done skulls I
have put black lines down first and not
just made it a little bit more difficult
for me to do and I'm also creating a
black line so I have a guide as to where
my teeth need to go around my mouth so
I'm gonna keep going in with the white
paint just creating little little teeth
and they don't have to be perfect
because we will touch them up as we go
with shading and all the detail and the
back molars you want to create those
little lines but I'm going to redo them
anyways later because I need to lay down
the black so I'll show you guys that
stuff later so for the inside or the
middle of the teeth what you want to do
is at the top of the tooth create like a
little upside down triangle and then a
thin line between the teeth a little
upside down triangle line between the
teeth keep doing that all throughout the
teeth and then I'm going to go back into
the black and start to fade it into the
teeth I've said the teeth like 20 times
I focus most of the product on the outer
part of the jaw and then as you can see
there just fade it away it's going to
give you more depth it's going to look
more realistic and make sure that you
fade towards the teeth with black
eyeshadow I found it to be easier for me
and then you see those little white
lines that we had made going into the
black I'm going to just remake them they
kind of look more x-ray ish this way
boom
then of course set the teeth with the
black light white pigment because you
want your teeth to glow also I was under
the impression that my teeth were gonna
glow anyways because white usually glows
under black light I was wrong it didn't
glow that much the pigment makes it glow
a lot more so just FYI for you guys and
then of course I'm bouncing around here
and adding any more shading where I see
fit so under the eyes I felt like I
needed a few more cracks in my skull so
I went in and did that and then going
back into my white paint I'm gonna add
highlights throughout the skull random
areas so like on the brow bone between
the brows in between these shadows that
I did here so after all the white
highlighting I'm pretty much done with
the skull now I'm moving on to the body
I'm just painting my whole body pretty
much everything in black body paint this
is optional and I did a sloppy job but I
figured my wig was gonna be covering
most of it so didn't really matter
anyways this was really hard to get of
my ears I'm pretty sure I still have
paint in certain places anyways moving
on I'm going into the white paint now
and creating the bones now I wouldn't
say my bones are very accurate literally
decided to do this last minute wasn't
sure I was going to do it so you may
want to reference another skeletal photo
because after I saw it I was like wait
my bones don't look right but you know
what the effect was there so that's all
that matters
and I'm just shading them with the blue
black light pigment and then of course
you want to go over all of that with the
white neon pigment as well or the white
black light pigment
and of course the finishing touch this
look is a wig lucky for me this wig was
glowing for my intro shots this wig is
from hair he goes on Instagram I will
link him down below and that is the
finished makeup look with no backlight
this is just under normal light but of
course if you guys make the Hat you can
be blacklight everywhere really hope you
guys enjoyed the tutorial and don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you did
