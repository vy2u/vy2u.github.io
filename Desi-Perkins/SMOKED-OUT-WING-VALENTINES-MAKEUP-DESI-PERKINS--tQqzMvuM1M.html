channel so today's video is going to be
on this makeup look right here you guys
have been requesting it like Gracie this
smoked out wing has been my go-to look
lately
mostly because I've been lazy to do like
a full on eyeshadow look once you get
the hang of this technique you can do it
like really quickly out the door just
skip the lashes if you want and just
throw on mascara and it gives your eyes
like a really nice almond E shape
I heard Angelina Jolie does this I mean
not as extreme as I did it but I've
heard from a makeup artist that her eyes
actually have a more round appearance
but with this technique is what gives
her that like super fierce cat eye look
I don't know if it's true people could
be lying to me and you can't trust
anybody these days but I'm gonna go with
it's true also I think this look would
be really pretty for Valentine's Day
it's simple but it's like sexual sexy
sexy is the word sexy and then you have
like a pink lip so it makes it nice and
soft and pretty and girly I'll have to
say let's get started okay so first
we're going to pick up Sienna my
favorite eye shadow and the small detail
shader brush by Zhu Ava and all you're
gonna do is follow this along your lash
line and sorry if I sound like I just
woke up it's because I did so why this
eyeliner is so easy is because to get
the shape of the line you're just gonna
follow that lower lash line straight up
towards the tail of your brow just keep
going with that line from the lower lash
line up and slowly taper that eyeshadow
away to a fine point and then you're
just gonna bring it back and just do
small little motions with the brush and
blend it take your time it's really easy
this way it's really hard to mess up
because of the eyeshadow color it's
really forgiving you could easily wipe
away anything you don't like
just blend it softly to a smoke so now
you have that wing down look like you're
sick that's cool we'll fix that don't
worry we're gonna layer fudge now and
kind of do the same exact thing that we
just did only keeping it closer to the
lash line on the bottom so I'm taking an
angled brush now to do this this is also
by zoeva it's the winged liner brush and
like I said just going to follow the
same steps I'm going right along the
Sienna shade we place down as your
shades of eyeshadow get darker you stay
closer to the lash line because you
don't want to cover up Sienna and you
just want it to kind of gradually fade
so I'm just placing this a little bit
lower than the Sienna and blending it
all together fusing it using it all
together to sound more professional
sometimes when I do this makeup look I
actually just stick with the brown and
the Sienna just to do like a really nice
smoked out Brown wing which I think
looks really really pretty especially
with green eyes this color combo will
make your eyes stand out a lot so if you
want to skip the black step you can
totally do that you don't have to use
the black eye shadow afterwards this is
what it looks like without the black eye
shadow but now we're going to go in with
the black eye shadow because you know I
like that drama so I'm with this going
like I said closest to the lashline and
sometimes I'm not gonna lie to you guys
I end up covering the dark brown I try
really hard not to but I get carried
away with the black so I'm trying really
hard not to cover the dark brown but
either way it adds like a really nice
gradient so here we go really really
packing that black eye shadow into the
lash line get them into the lashes so
that you don't see a space between your
lashes and your lash line
this step is totally optional but I like
to take my Inglot gel liner and this
really small Smith cosmetics brush so
the tiniest liner brush that I love and
I like to just create a line in the
inner corner I'm actually taking a
angled brush and just lightly winging it
feathering it out let's see how that
gives your eye more of a cat shape I
literally just follow the tear duct and
make a little triangle in the inner
corner next I'm applying my Marc Jacobs
mascara and of course my iconic lashes
these are from house of lashes some of
my faves I always get asked what lashes
I'm wearing when I wear these all right
so I gave the Make Up For Ever
foundation another shot in the stick
form and I used it only in my highlight
areas like my under eye area because my
under eyes have been so dry like my skin
in general and this worked really well
to give a really nice natural finish in
that area that stayed really hydrated so
I feel like for drier skin it looks
really nice so I'm really liking this
when I do it this way now I'm taking in
the fit me by Maybelline this is the
matte and poreless and the Loreal Pro
matte I like to mix these two
foundations together because I get one a
good color that I like into I love the
L'Oreal infallible but sometimes it can
be a little too matte and the Maybelline
fit me is not as matte so mixing them
together gives me really good coverage
with not such a dry matte look I'm just
using my Beauty Blender to blend that
all in dude I don't know why my face has
been so pale lately like I don't know if
it's my dark hair that makes me look
more pale but I need to get a tan
ASAP my face is paler than my whole body
like for some I think it's cuz I keep my
face at the Sun but I'm having to match
the color to my neck then I'm going to
take my concealer this is the NARS
concealer and today I'll be using
custard because I want a more highlight
look
of course using my beauty blender to
blend that out
I like to balance out the rest of my
face with high light as well that way I
don't just have highlight under my eyes
you just see two white streaks so I'm
also going to highlight the other high
points of the face you guys know the
drill the bridge of the nose then
forehead the chin keep its bow
now you're just going to want to set
that laura mercier trans isn't
oh my voice just cracked laura mercier
translucent powder and I like to dip my
Beauty Blender in it very lightly I'm
not going to use a crapload of this or
baked because if your skin is dry and
you try to bake not going to look good
you're going to look like yzma
from Emperor's New Groove that's what
happened to me so I'm just light layer
and then I'm taking my Mac shear pressed
powder this is just like a setting
powder and setting my makeup and of
course Mac give me Sun you guys know
this is where I live I try to use the
different bronzer and Stephen said why
aren't you using that give me Sun and
then I was like you're right I need to
use Mac give me Sun so I did I'm just
going to apply that in the hollows of my
face cheekbones around the jawline and
also on the hairline now I'm going to
mix two of the Anasazi Beverly Hills
contour shades lightly and give myself a
slight contour to make those cheekbones
pop I'm just laying down the product
first cuz I don't want a lot so I'm just
laying it on both sides and then I'm
going to blend it all out for blush i'll
be using mac pinch-me
I love this color I feel like it just
gives your cheeks that really nice
pretty flirty flushed look nice and pink
I'm applying a lot because little tip is
that blush is the first thing to fade
out of all your makeup so if you're
going to go out apply a tiny bit more
blush than you would because it will
fade the quickest and as you guys saw I
just sprayed my brush with mac fix+ and
then dipped it into my gilded honey
highlighter this is going to give you
like an instant crazy highlight and
that's what I want so I'm just applying
that on the tops of the cheekbones the
tip of the nose the Cupid's bow so for
my lip liner I'm going to be using Mac
oak lip liner I've been using this
pretty much with every nude lip color
lately that you've seen on snapchat and
I've been over lining my lips just along
the Cupid's bow together
that little plump appearance but I keep
the lower lip normal don't over line
that one and then for my lipstick I'll
be using Mac kind of sexy which is one
of my old favorites it's just again a
really fresh color and it has like a
pink undertone to it and then just set
your face with some fix plus just set
the face give yourself a few spritz and
you're done
all right so that's it for the tutorial
