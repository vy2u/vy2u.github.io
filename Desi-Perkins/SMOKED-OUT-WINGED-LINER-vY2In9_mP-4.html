today I did a tutorial on this smoked
out winged liner so if you like what you
see that people watching
I've already gone ahead and primed my
eyes with soft ochre by Mac now I'm
going in with this flight shade from the
lorac Pro palette and I'm applying that
to the brow bone and just sweeping it
downwards towards the crease now I'm
going to go in with cream and pack that
on the lid as our base shade
I'm taking sable from that same palette
on a Mac two to four and I'm gonna use
this as my transition shade and make
sure to buff it out really well
now I'm going to take the black shade
and a angled brush and I'm just gonna
map out where my wing is gonna be and
that way I can just start smoking out
the shadows along the edge I'm gonna mix
sable and expresso on a Mac 217 and I'm
just gonna sweep the color across in a
diagonal motion and slowly blend it
inwards in between putting on all the
shadows I like to pick up makes you 2:4
and kind of just make sure that the
edges are staying nice and blended to
warm up the look of it I'm going to go
in with brown script by Mac which is a
reddish brown and I'm just gonna kind of
run that along the edges if you find
that your eye shadows got a little crazy
then just take the white and clean up
the brow bone it's time to pop on some
liners so I'm gonna go in with my Inglot
gel liner and I'm gonna trace over the
guide line that I had made with the
black shadow and after I've done that
what I do is drag the liner back towards
the inside of my eye and keep making it
as thick as I want
now I'm gonna use the same liner and I'm
just gonna line my waterline with this
and I know it's gonna look a little
crazy and harsh but don't worry we'll go
back and fix that later pop on your
mascara and this is just kinda to give
your lashes a good coat before we apply
our falsies and I'm just gonna pop those
on real quick
lashes on no I'm gonna finish up my face
by putting on this Mac prep and prime in
a light boost and this is just gonna
brighten the under eyes and also clean
up any fallout that happened with these
shadows and by the way I've already
applied foundation it's the Armani
luminous silk in number seven if you
guys are interested I'm using my Beauty
Blender and this is an actually a Beauty
Blender it's from Walmart it's a really
nice sponge by sohail I really like it
anyways I'm just blending all that out
with this sponge now we're gonna go
ahead and set all of that with a setting
powder just so that it doesn't crease up
they look crazy and finally finishing
off the eyes by blending Brown script
along that black liner
I'm gonna take my favorite face powder
and set everything with that now we're
gonna go in with this beautiful tart
off-the-cuff palette and I'm going to
use the bronzer in it and I'm just gonna
hollow my cheekbones out just a tad also
give myself a little bit of a team and
take this peach shade pop that on the
apples of my cheeks and pull the color
upwards pick up your favorite
highlighter and apply that to the tops
of your cheekbones just to give you that
nice healthy glow and I'm also gonna put
that on my nose and Cupid's bow
I'm taking at this really nude lipstick
and applying it to my lips I know some
people don't really care too much for
this really nude lip look but okay
alright guys this is the last step I
hope you guys enjoy the tutorial and as
always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
