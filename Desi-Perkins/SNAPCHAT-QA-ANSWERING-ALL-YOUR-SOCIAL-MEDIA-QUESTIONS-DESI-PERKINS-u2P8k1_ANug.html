so today's video is gonna be a snapchat
Q&amp;amp;A and instead of making it a Q&amp;amp;A where
you guys just like ask whatever
questions you want I thought it'd be
better if we just honed in on like one
topic so a huge thing that I always
wanted to know about when starting in
social media was social media and how it
worked so I thought it would be cool to
do a video just in case any of you guys
are aspiring to do whatever it is in
social media whether it be fashion
beauty whatever floats your boat so I
wanted to answer some questions for you
guys and just give you any advice that I
have obviously I'm not an expert but I
will give you any advice that you ask
for that I have in my noggin and I also
apologize I am sick right now I'm trying
to just really fight it so I sound a
little stuffy let's go ahead I'm gonna
open up your guys's snaps hopefully
there's no dps in here how do you deal
with all the negativity because I
couldn't do it I just want to know how
you do it how I love you oh that was
funny that's a huge one how to deal with
negativity you know what I think
everybody would like to say that it
doesn't get to them that they just let
it go I'm just being super candid with
you guys when I say that most of the
time that's the case and most of the
time I can see a lot of negativity and
I'm just like whatever there are certain
days where I feel more emotional or just
you know when we're having bad days I
feel like negativity will get to me a
little bit more than other days it just
kind of depends on how I'm feeling about
myself
and how I'm feeling at the moment and
sometimes something will really hurt me
majority of the time it's honestly just
something I let roll off my shoulder and
if somebody says you're ugly I'm like
okay what do you what do you want me to
do about that you know everyone's always
gonna have something to say about you
and you just have to try your hardest to
understand that those comments don't
shouldn't really affect you and and it's
okay sometimes to let them affect you
but not to overwhelm you and and just
consume you because then you will not
survive I know people think that this
job is like easy and it is a lot of fun
I love what I do
also like it's a lot of pressure
sometimes and the negativity when you're
a lot of pressure can really just like
eat away at you sometimes so you really
just have to put the blinders on keep it
moving
just who cares what they say you saw
what I actually wanted to say there but
like who cares just just go just bye
get out of here sometimes when people
leave me in comments I'll just respond
to them in a nice way
they like stop writing me in comments
I've had people say like I'm sorry for
what I said because I was nice to them
and I think sometimes people just maybe
want the attention but if you're doing
social media don't give them the fuel to
be more angry like try to make them
happier if that makes sense
I love that you're sitting on the toilet
that's such a good question oh there's
so many people I love to follow on
Instagram that just inspire me Linda
Hallberg oh god she is just I have never
seen somebody with so much creativity
she is probably one of my favorite
people to follow because she pumps out a
new makeup book every day and honestly
she just gives me so much inspiration to
try and step outside my comfort zone I
just love her Linda Hallberg she's
amazing of course I love to follow all
my friends because they're great to
fluster looks crispy Shayla I love Sarah
II so many people but creative wise any
time I'm really feeling like I need a
new makeup look I always go to Linda
Hallberg stage and she really gets all
of my creative juices going do you have
any advice on somebody who's just
starting out the best advice I could
give is whatever your topic is say your
fashion beauty whatever it is you really
want to make sure to focus your page
more so on that topic so if you want to
have a beauty page start posting makeup
looks consistently and when I say
consistently I mean like every day on
your free time create a really cool
makeup look something that's gonna get
you noticed something that's different
because it's so saturated right now
there's so many people trying to do
social media you want to do something
that's gonna get you noticed
you want to make it like a business at
first you have to start off really
focused on it as a business think of it
as a portfolio somewhere where you
showcase all your artwork if you are
smaller to maybe use a couple hashtags
don't go crazy like don't have a pair
full of hashtags I mean you can but I
would just keep it at like five five big
hashtags maybe look up what's trending
at the moment and hashtag that list all
the make up items that you use and tag
the brands because brands are looking to
post new work all the time that's
something that's true and it's always
gonna be true they don't care if you're
big or small they just want to post
people's work that's great and so that's
that's a big key major key also it's
really important don't post your
Cinnabons you're in and out you and bae
unless your highlights laying and that
picture then post that photo you know
what i'm saying and then later down the
line as you get like more recognition
and you're bigger people are gonna want
to know about your personal life and
they're gonna want to be you know closer
to you and then that's when you could
really just be like there's my cinnabon
there's bae Casey nice tat outside of
the bikini honestly he's like the best
like I am so inspired by him and like
honestly I've just never seen someone so
hard-working so creative constantly
innovating like I wish I could be Casey
nice dad sometimes like in my mind I
just think about him and I'm like I wish
I could just wake up every single day
and do what he does maybe I can't I
don't know I don't know if I could it's
hard work and he makes it look easy
every single day if you guys don't
follow him oh my god you have to follow
him he does daily vlogs his editing is
amazing his content is amazing it's
consistent he's always finding ways to
kind of change it up and Steven and I
love him oh my god if he saw this I'd be
such a creep she said she just started
doing makeup how does she keep going
when people aren't responding to her
work positively that's a very hard
question no matter what bigger small
there's gonna be times where you put out
work that people don't like at that
point you just have to keep on pushing
ok people didn't like that I still loved
it and that's fine I really really
really liked it so it shouldn't take
away from your soul like from your
creativity I find that the only time it
takes away from me and my soul is when I
put something out that I'm not proud of
and then everybody doesn't like it then
it's like well I knew I didn't love that
look and I put it out there so in that
sense it can hurt me but if I'm proud of
ding and I'm putting it out people don't
like it I still like it so it's fine
next time I'll try again to do something
that more people will like but don't
stop doing something just because other
people don't like it because I promise
you that there's gonna be people who
love it it is not easy
I don't do it that much anymore I need
to keep doing it it's really really hard
it's super tricky I'm not gonna lie to
you guys when I first started it was a
little bit easier because Instagram was
the only social media outlet I had to
worry about now I have to make sure that
I'm snapping and filming videos and
editing videos and posting on Instagram
and also answering your questions on
Twitter so there's a lot of social media
that I have to keep up with and it gets
really tricky but I think if you want to
post a makeup look every day you really
can you can do anything you want to do
you just have to make time for it some
people say there is no time and and I
understand that because sometimes I say
that I'm like I just didn't have the
time today but I know deep down that I
could put aside maybe two hours do my
makeup post a look especially if all you
have going is Instagram you should
definitely be you know posting every
single day there's a lot of things that
I keep private and I think I'm very open
at the same time so if it has anything
to do with me and just me I feel like
I'm really open with everybody and I'm
okay with it
I share so much of my life with you guys
in a way it helps me because if I'm
feeling sad I do feel like you guys help
me feel better at times or if I'm mad or
whatever it is I like to keep you guys
involved and I have no problem sharing
most of my life with you guys if there's
anything that I don't share with you
guys it's because it may involve other
people and I don't really personally
like to speak on topics that involve
other people if it's just about me I can
make that decision for myself so I guess
that's the only time I I'm private is
when it's involving other people and
it's up to you what you want to share
with social media you don't have to
share everything a lot of people keep
their private life private and they're
still very successful it's really just
how comfortable you feel everyone is
gonna be different you may not want to
share your shrimp pasta recipe with the
world you know but Steven does
do you get free products from different
brands I'm just when you say free makeup
and you know people say like oh they
send them on these free trips it's
important that you guys know especially
if you're gonna be in social media that
nothing is actually free brands are
trading marketing and promotion for
their product or these trips so even
before influencers were sent on trips
I'm sure they used to really take
editors on trips or on fancy dinners
because at that point in time editors
were the ones who wrote in magazines and
you know talked about product in
magazines and then that's how you guys
found out about them so it's all about
marketing really and we are giving them
something in return we are helping them
promote their products granted they are
very aware that we will not promote
something that we don't love so we're
never forced to promote something say I
don't love it and I tell you guys hey
you know what I didn't like that because
at the end of the day the reason that
they're doing this with influencers is
because we've worked really really hard
to build trust and build this platform
with you guys all so at the end of the
day I'm not gonna ruin my integrity with
you guys just to post a make up product
with a brand even when it comes to
sponsored videos I will have the Brandt
and send me items before I do the
sponsored videos so that I could say
like I like this product or I don't like
this product so I don't want to do the
video that's why I'm like really that's
why sometimes it's hard when people get
upset that you do sponsored videos cuz
you know at the end of the day this is
our job you also have to know that not
everybody does things just for money and
people do actually care about their
integrity and they don't want to ruin
that because our integrity and our trust
with you guys is really our whole career
like the minute I lose my trust with you
guys are my integrity that's it for me
like I would never jeopardize that so no
nothing is free people send it for trade
of marketing but it's very organic and I
think that's why social media is such a
phenomenon because we are able to be
honest nobody's giving us a script and
saying you have to say this we can say
whatever we want and we can hate a
product if we want and we don't have to
feel bad because I believe the brands
are understanding I've never had a
problem more like a brand it's like I
can't believe you said even like that
product it's normal it's human
not everything's gonna work for me so
free product is is really trade and
trips are really trade and that's that's
the way it works so if you guys were
ever interested that's that's how it
works
I work out I still eat bad sometimes
when I really know that I have something
to be fit for like when I know I'm gonna
be in a bikini
I will eat really healthy and work out a
lot but yeah I just make sure that I'm
constantly staying physically fit
working out and going to the gym even
though I don't necessarily love it I'm
not one of those people that loves to
work out and I love bad food I love
tacos you just got to find balance where
you could eat bad food sometimes and try
to eat healthy most of the time that's
really what I do I'm gonna be really
candid with you guys with these answers
I'm not gonna worry about like how it's
gonna make me look or whatever but
social media is just sometimes it makes
you pick yourself apart I get picked
apart so badly and then I start to think
about it like oh you know is my nose
crooked like you know like should I be
so insecure about my teeth like just
people will really tear you down and and
as much as you don't want to let it get
to you sometimes it will get to you and
and you take a million photos of
yourself every single day and you have
to make sure it's perfect and you don't
want to edit your photo too much but if
you don't take that out people are gonna
just be like tear you down about it you
want to stay so true to like you know
the real you but then it's like do I
leave that pimple in the picture or do I
take it out people are gonna tear me
down if I don't it's just even little
things I'm just constantly always
thinking about imperfections and I've
gotten to a point now where I'm like
okay this is this is who I am I've
accepted it but there's still certain
things sometimes I feel like just a lot
of overanalyzing basically is what I'm
trying to say constant overanalyzing of
yourself that can be hard sometimes
favorite bloggers and who do you follow
the most on snapchat
she sent me who i falled abyssal subject
hello Katie duh I have to she's always
throwing shade at me so I have to check
and see what's up if you guys don't know
Katie I mean you know lustreless oh do
you I have a video on my youtube channel
all about how I edit my pictures and I'd
say face tune is my favorite app I've
removed people in face tune I'm champion
what does my mom think about social
media my mom loves it she loves social
media she tells me I thought it was the
cutest thing the other day she said when
you don't post on snapchat I get upset
because I'm just wondering like what are
you doing
why aren't you one snapchat and I
started laughing and she said that she
loves it because she feels like she's
always with me and that she always gets
to see what I'm doing and making sure
that I'm okay and I'm not out causing
trouble even though I am a lot of the
time when you say reach out if you mean
to other influencers I would say do
looks inspired by influencers tag them
like the actual picture tag because I
always go through my tagged photos and
if I see somebody in there that like has
balm makeup and I'm like wow they're
really cool I will like all the photos
and then those likes populate in
everyone who follows me or people that I
follow and then they see your work also
don't spam in the comments because those
are annoying and nobody goes to those
pages just being real also don't ask for
shoutouts I would have never asked for a
shout-out because I want my work to
speak for itself I don't want to ask
somebody like hey can you shout me out I
just want somebody to see my work and be
like dang that's really really good you
should want to be doing this because you
enjoy it and not because you want to
like get shoutouts
Marland I'm just wondering if you're
consistent and you're putting out good
work and you're doing all the things all
the practices like tagging brands and
maybe hash tagging trending things that
eventually you will get noticed just
keep going and doing and do it because
you love it and the thing is that a lot
of influencers now when they first
started had no idea what social media
was gonna be like we didn't know this
was gonna be a career I didn't do it
because I wanted to be popular I did it
because man I love makeup and I want
people to see it and if anything I'll
get freelance work out of it and then it
just turned into this so I feel like
there was a raw passion there and it was
just doing what I love and I think
people see that people will see that
you're doing it because you love it and
they will want to share you and they'll
be like this artist is amazing I have so
much respect for them I do do that
there's still times I look back at
photos I picked and I was like why did I
pick that photo or why did I over edit
that photo you just have to have a
friend that you could show them to and
say hey one or two a lot of us actually
will have a group chat going and we will
send options like to our friends like
hey Katie hey Shayla which picture
should I post one or two and then they
will tell you and when you take a vote
it's pretty much sure thing that
everyone votes on the same photo that
it's hot fire so I just want to make
sure that you have two opinions because
you just never know they're trying to
show me her cut creed did you see that
she went like this after it looked good
girl snapchat is huge it's a huge tool
because I feel it's very personal I feel
a really strong connection with you guys
there sometimes I I fall off of
Instagram for like a couple days but I
feel okay about it because I'm so
connected with you guys through snapchat
I use snapchat to also to let you guys
know what I have you know a YouTube
video or I posted a new Instagram photo
it's kind of like I can keep you guys up
to date then you guys know oh she has a
new video so you'll go watch it or
you'll go like my photo because you're
so loyal Steven when you first started
filming videos on YouTube steven is the
most supportive person in this planet
it's a little awkward talking about him
cuz he's behind the camera right now but
uh he just said let's do it let's film
the YouTube video he's always been
supportive when I hated my job I used to
the cocktail serve and and I was getting
really mistreated and I hated it so much
and he came to my work to visit me I
just started crying because I was so
overwhelmed he was like what's wrong I
just said I hate my job I'm so stressed
out and then I remember he was just like
we'll quit just quit and I was like what
do you mean quit like I can't quit and
he's like just quit and do your makeup
and like whatever and we'll figure it
out I said wow I quit and it was the
sweetest thing I'll never forget and he
was very supportive has turned you into
a celebrity I don't feel like I'm a
celebrity I don't feel like I'm famous I
feel like I'm just somebody who has
become friends with so many other people
on the internet because I have a similar
passion to you actually makes me a
little bit uncomfortable when people say
that I think I'm just somebody who maybe
I don't know inspires you to do a makeup
look or inspires you to do something
else and and there's people out there
who inspire me to do the same thing and
at the end of the day we're all peers
and we all just love the same things I'm
in constant competition with myself in
my head sometimes I feel like I could be
a little too hard on myself I always
just want to make sure that I'm changing
evolving more than I was yesterday I'm
not really trying to compete with
anybody else and that's the good thing
about social media is that you don't
have to compete with anybody else you're
not competing with anybody at least
that's not how I see it starting out I
never try to compete with anybody I
admired people's work and I think that's
why the beauty community is for the most
part really like a beautiful thing
everybody loves to share each other's
work and people are really supportive
because we need each other to help fuel
that creativity and you see somebody on
Instagram you're like oh my god that
work is amazing you don't have hate for
that person
have to respect them for giving you
motivation to keep going and be better
and and do better work and I think just
keeping yourself in it and letting
others inspire you is what inspires me
alright guys so that is it those were
the questions I know you guys had a ton
more maybe I'll have to do another video
on social media because I feel like you
guys are really interested in knowing
these kinds of things so let me know
what you guys thought about this video
and if you guys have any other snapchat
Q&amp;amp;A topics that you are interested in
leave them in the comments down below
I'll try to make this like a reoccurring
thing like different topics things you
guys want to know I'm an open book
leave them in the comments down below
and I'll see you guys next time bye off
the front camera okay my nose is running
babe I need tissue I love her she says
she had Vegemite stuck in her teeth and
she was awesome do I have something in
my teeth oh this whole time oh man ah we
