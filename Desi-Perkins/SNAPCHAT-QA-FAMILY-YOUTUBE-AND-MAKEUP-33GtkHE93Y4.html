is gonna be a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A kind of a
last-minute thing I just decided do it
real quick I was sitting down doing my
makeup just for fun
sometimes I have to do my makeup just
without cameras and then I was like well
I already have a makeup done let's film
a video real quick it's gonna open your
guys's snaps on camera and then answer
your questions and if you hear any
commentary I do have my brothers here
let's see what we got going on here she
said who's your parents favorite child
you're the only one that if you go
without talking to her for even a day
messes up her entire vibe but if we do
it she's like she doesn't care oh so I
would say I'm my mom's favorite cuz I'm
her only girl in a sea of boys is the
age difference between you and your
brother she said what's the age
difference between me and my brother's
so I have three brothers my oldest
brother is Michael and he's 33 and then
I have Marky a he's 23 and then Danny
who's the youngest and he's 22 so those
are all my brothers ages those little
shits I was 12 that's when I first like
try to do winged liner and I looked
terrible my dad kind of said something
I'll never forget like he kind of made
fun of me a little bit like girls going
on with your eyeliner but it only pushed
me to make it better and now Meeta
What's Up now dad hmm
that you would want to carry on as a
tradition
oh my dad used to put me in front of the
mirror when I was a little kid like I
was just this little girl and when I was
like dressed and ready for the day like
he would put me in front of the mirror
and he'd say look in the mirror and he'd
look at me and be like who is that girl
that's the most beautiful girl I've ever
seen and he would say look how pretty
she is and she's so funny and smart and
he would just encourage me and I would
get really embarrassed like stop doing
that but now looking back I'm like he
always wanted me to be super confident
and he always wanted me to feel okay
with who I am as a person and I feel
like it just helped me so much and I
never forget that he did that I don't
even think he knows if I if I remember
that but I do I always remember that
it's just giving your kids that
confidence it was awesome it was great I
want to do that with my kids make sure
that they know that they're you know so
important and special and I'm sure
they're gonna be they have to be funny
right my kids they better be is your
best memory with your camera there's so
many memories one year for Christmas my
mom said like let's decorate the whole
Christmas tree with all of your guys's
toys my brothers were really into like
little action figures like little
animals it was probably the ugliest
Christmas tree we ever had but it was
like so much fun
and I always remember doing it it was
good it kind of tilted like this a
little bit I was like does he I just
wanted to ask you what your advice would
be to somebody who's just trying to
start out doing makeup thank you
what I did was I watched a ton of
YouTube videos all the time I just
watched people's techniques learned it's
like going to school people are teaching
you their techniques for free which is
awesome that's why I love YouTube so
much then I would look at images through
magazines I would rip them out and I
would always say like this is the like I
want to try today I'd sit down and I try
that makeup look on myself sometimes
it'd look like crap and sometimes it
would be like really good but
progressively you'll get better and you
just have to keep working on it it
should just be fun and just have fun
with it
beginners on YouTube do you think their
camera quality and lighting is more
important or the products that they have
in their videos are they more impress I
don't think the products that you're
using are ever the most important I
think you could have a slay ass YouTube
channel and use whatever products you
want if you're doing good
I think for sure at this point of
youtube I think lighting and camera is
important but I don't think that you
need to spend a crapload of money on it
I think there's ways to get good
lighting if you are really committed
daylight is really good daylight looks
bomb if you're trying to start a YouTube
on a budget just get a camera even if
it's your iPhone because I phone these
days takes good quality video if you
have good lighting maybe if I wasn't a
youtuber I can produce videos for brand
I could design swimsuits I could maybe
be a teacher that's what I went to
school for who knows who knows wow
that's a good question girl uh no I
don't think I've thought of quitting
YouTube I'm not like I'm still like
really enjoying doing YouTube as of now
so I thought of like changing up and
expanding my YouTube a little bit more
because I love doing other things other
than makeup too and I just want to put
it out there I want to put out cool
videos whether it be you know vlogs or
makeup or just things for no reason but
that just are cool so I've thought of
like expanding and doing different
things but not quitting I am going quit
someone's gonna one day when I wait
they're gonna have that clip out like I
ain't going quit I was just wondering
what color correctors you recommend cuz
I have purple bags and I just want to
get rid of those nasty things Thanks
she's cute the perfect thing to get rid
of bags like actual hollows I would say
cuz she doesn't really have bags but
like if you have a little bit of hollow
and hahaha you have a little bit of
hollowness bye-bye under-eye bi8
Cosmetics is so good it's amazing and if
you want a color correct purple which is
like dark circles and you want to use
like a salmon color or an orange color
corrector under your eyes okay to be
Oh question is well lash glue determines
what lash glue do I use House of lash
glue love and hate it at the same time
because it works so good if you want to
lash glue that's not going to come off
House of lashes is the glue if you want
to cry if you want to swim that stuff is
like heavy-duty sometimes the glue gets
stuck in my eyelashes and I'll have lash
glue in my eyelashes for like three days
well my face isn't flawless all the time
I do have breakouts even though you guys
don't believe me but I'm very very
strict about my skin care I do not go a
night without taking off my makeup using
all my skin care like I am on it all the
time choose between lipsticks and
highlighters which one definitely 100%
highlighter highlighter always when will
you tell us the new hide key color I see
you sporting those on the Loews girl oh
I wasn't expecting that slay snap I
don't know when I'll be telling you guys
the new color I have to get the green
light to be able to tell you guys the
new color hopefully soon very soon okay
otaku carne asada go on cilantro Savoia
salsa con todo Limon oh and I love
pickled jalapeno and carrots that you
eat them with I'm so hungry right now
what's your favorite funny face to do
you take like years ago when I went to
Vegas with my friends and I was still
young and reckless I would hate when
guys would just be so aggressive and
wouldn't stop talking to me so I created
this face and I don't know why I called
it the Gopher and any time a guy would
start talking to me or be like
disrespectful or rude and he just
wouldn't take no for an answer I would
just stare at him and make this face
sometimes that even lift my hands up
like this and then I wouldn't say
anything I would literally stay stay
there and stare at them like that until
they felt so uncomfortable that they
would just walk away one guy I remember
she was like is she serious right now
is this serious we all just stayed quiet
and I just and I called it the Gopher
like I had these little it was great it
lived on for so long I would do that all
the time
snatched like everything is perfect like
her body she was wearing a t-shirt a
white tee jeans and some Tim's and she
just looked so I could literally see her
body muscles through all of it like she
just looked so good
is it ever okay for guys to dye their
hair red please say no let him live girl
let him live but I wanted to know yours
or Katie's ultimate favorite toning
shampoo Pravana is my favorite Pravana I
just discovered it recently I was in my
favorites it's really really good what
is your favorite liquid lipstick what is
your favorite eyeshadow oh my gosh I
can't keep up I missing to let you keep
going would you ever get any surgery or
work I love you but I got it I don't
even remember all the questions okay I'm
just gonna say which ones I remember my
favorite liquid lipstick formula is dose
of colors would I get plastic surgery
who knows maybe after kids if my boobs
sag more you just never know
I'm not against it what else what else
did he ask favorite let's say that's all
I remember
even without foundation yours
always looks a plus since in my teenage
years it has to do with like hormone
level it can't hurt to be able to
control it or just hide it when I was a
teenager I got breakouts like crazy all
here in this area and it sucks like
growing up in social media now because
people didn't take pictures and care if
they were perfect and I feel like you
know kids now are growing up and they
have to take pictures and they're
worried about people posting them
everywhere so they have to tune them
they have to fix them they have to
filter them it's like so much thinking
goes into photos but like when you're a
teenager you just have to kind of just
be happy and live life live your life I
look back at photos and I was living
when not a care in the world I thought I
was looking so cute I never even noticed
that I broke out that's how unaware I
was like I was just out doing fun stuff
I look back at photos and I was like
well I actually broke out a lot but I
never let it really bother me there's
definitely things you can do I always
recommend like go see a dermatologist
because only they can tell you what's
good for your skin so anything is really
bad by yourself what do you say
that's a good question music helps me so
much light I'm feeling tired or sad or
something like I crank up music that I
love and then I just kind of get into
this groove hang out with your friends
Katie always puts me in a better mood
she always makes me laugh I watch Disney
movies because Disney movies fix
everything they like make you forget
whatever's happening um if I can only
wear one makeup item what would it be
brow pencil because I don't have rolls
hey girl so I don't know if you've ever
been asked this but I was wondering when
is your birthday my birthday is March
3rd if your name wasn't dezzy what would
you want your name to be I always really
love when girls have like boyish names
Harley's a really cute name cuz I really
really like Harley Quinn in the new
movie I thought that was cute oh you
color good whoo secret secret how do you
stay positive like what are some advices
that you would give to someone that's
going through things you know what's
funny is that like I try to stay
positive especially on social media I
don't like to put out a lot of
negativity I don't like to put out like
a lot of drama I like to stay positive
you just have to surround yourself with
positive people just remember that
things in life are not permanent I've
said it on snapchat I always like to say
a bad experience in life is just life's
way of guiding you down a different road
and it's just gonna suck for a little
bit but then you're gonna end up in this
place and how would you have ended up in
this great place if it wasn't for that
bad experience so it's like just
remembering that everything is temporary
hey desi if you had to pick one chola
thing to do either eyebrows or lips
which one would you pick
roll already done did that back in the
day I used to do those lips you know the
dark lip liner I went through that phase
I did I totally admire you as a youtuber
because you promote animal adoption I
just want to know who ever wanted to
work towards like promoting that or
helping a cause I'm a huge believer of
adopting pets I adopted my babies and I
love them I can't even imagine my life
without them and they have so much
personality and a dog that comes from a
breeder is like not better than a dog
that comes from
a rescue group or a pound like they're
all so cute and I just feel like there's
so many dogs that are like just sitting
there waiting for a home and I feel like
if you guys want to get a dog you should
go to the pound first or rescue groups
just want to know if you go anywhere in
the world where would you go where is
your dream destination
I've always wanted to go to Thailand and
I'm not even really too sure why I just
feel like it has a lot of culture it's
beautiful and Steven maybe he'll take me
one day what's your favorite boy Dead
Boys product just say that your contour
is a little off so actually really yeah
no shade you little bitch
what's your wait are you are you Pro
mowing yourself on my snapchat get all
the girls in my excuse Caribes
how long we're gonna be filming another
video together soon I ordered something
I'm really excited for it's just like
gonna be a funny video it has nothing to
do with makeup at all
but I can't wait so excited hey does
these so my question is I know you get a
bunch of products all the time from
different brands for free and what do
you do with the ones that you don't use
vloggers do get sent a lot of makeup for
PR from makeup companies and I don't use
all of it there's definitely no way I
could use it all yeah they're put things
aside for giveaways for you guys I let
my friends take whatever makeup they
want my family and then I also donate
makeup to women shelters so I'll just
create boxes of clothes and stuff like
that and take them to the women shelter
that's where all the makeup goes that I
don't use did you grow up in a
traditional Hispanic household and yes
did your parents teach you Spanish yes
the chancla everything all of it all of
it I had a good childhood though but
yeah it's very traditional what's your
biggest pet peeve my biggest pet peeve I
can't handle like loud chewing that
sound like it it actually makes me like
it goes like this like all of a sudden
I'm like and then I like go crazy
hi Jesse I love you I was just wondering
when you
Katie first met and how long you guys
have been friends love you
two-and-a-half years ago I think we
weren't friends like right away you know
we were a little suspect of each other
we're just like I see you she's like I
see you too and then somehow like one
day we just clicked and it was like
stepbrothers we looked at each other and
we're like like we both thought did we
just become best friends but we didn't
say it until recently because we're
weird about our emotions like that you
know what I love about Katie a nice
friendship and I hate that you guys
asked me about Katie because then she
gets all excited that I speak highly of
her my favorite part of our friendship
is that I feel absolutely no competition
no jealousy everything that we do
together is like we want each other to
do better even than you know like we
just want to make sure that each of us
is improving in life and like we
motivate each other and and that's why
it kills me like I hate when people try
to compare her and I like oh you did
better on this or she won that it's like
I don't ever want to be compared to
anybody like especially my best friend
it's really hard to find friends who
want the best for you who truly want the
best for you our friendship is easy it's
not hard it's just it works alright guys
so that is it for the snapchat Q&amp;amp;A today
for the next one I'm gonna do more of a
topic like I did on my last snapchat Q&amp;amp;A
I love all you guys thank you for all
you bees for making guest appearances on
my channel today and I'll see you guys
