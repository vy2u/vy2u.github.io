to say I'm just gonna be here she's here
here for support
okay least that slay ready I'm ready
let's go
super close missing it's a way back love
you guys are awesome oh she was a sweet
how we met hey hey hey
you until you have to tell it was a
rocky start let me tell you that yeah we
first met through YouTube of course we
both became FC stylists and then Katie
was the new kid coming in she moved here
from San Francisco
alright California Northern California
we just didn't click at first we ended
up not really liking each other which is
so strange now thinking of it you were
so mean to me
I was so not mean to you remember we
bonded that one night wouldn't eat like
a nose our own you were really drunk I
was so nice to yes true I don't know why
we didn't click actually I do know
because we have the same joke we had the
same like but no Katie and I insult each
other because that's how we show our
affection towards each other we both
have brothers so it's like that's kind
of how we grew up like I insult her she
insults me some people think it's mean
but we just laugh at each other all the
time and I think when you first meet
somebody and you try to like insult them
it doesn't work
it's not work so well don't do it I'm
like you know when you're not really
close yet it's more of a close thing go
wait for it you gotta wait favorite guys
little met in high school which won't
have been friends
hell no just kidding Stacy and Katie a
question you're kind of like a lemur
you're kind of a llama
he's a llama
oh my god do the llama face no so ugly
and also I think puppies like you both
are gorgeous and yeah what do you think
plays more I think does isla is more no
you definitely slate as over the night
at you bet way more it's like a good day
if I put shoes on you know what I mean
like you definitely slay more often than
I do
did you see what she was altering today
I was wearing pedicure flip-flops around
town looking good kid looking good
but you or them so hard I don't think
anyone's plays more than the other I
feel like if I'm gonna have a week where
I just can't slay Katie's gonna slay for
the both of us it's when my energy goes
back and forth it's never at the same
time the slow energy l'énergie kind of
sickness have you faint in the past to
get out of like work her school that's
such a good one you that is a good one
so I used to be a cocktail server one
time I really wanted Halloween off and
they wouldn't give it to me and hold
like I already know what you did oh yeah
holy attire II I did I told you this
video considered you guys I faked having
diarrhea and I strategically faked it I
kept making sure my manager saw me like
running to the bathroom I went at least
10 times before I went up to him and I
was like listen I have something really
embarrassing I have diarrhea I gotta go
and he was like what like his face it's
just like who lies about having diarrhea
and nobody else follow up nobody will
ask this almost question it's solid it's
like everybody's about to have diary
everybody's fun to have diary after this
video I got out of work and I had a
great time sooo yeah girl what did you
guys not that weird
I used to blow to my forehead like oh
it's like what yeah like if I was at
home like younger when I was in school I
do try your forehead blow-dry my
forehead tell my mom I was feeling
really sick and she would like feel my
head and she wouldn't hear my blow dryer
she just I don't know I she just
wouldn't like ask he'll accuse about it
but I think the only thing I did I never
really called it sick how to work ever
really like voice no I was really
unreliable you know you have to request
days off like years in advance or like
you know when you work in a restaurant I
would strategically think okay what
holidays are my favorite Halloween or
like fourth of July to go out when I was
younger and so I would say like ooh a
fourth of July fell on a Tuesday that
year I'd be like I can't work Tuesdays I
would literally go the whole like six
months without working Tuesdays just so
I could get well the fourth of July like
scarily strategic yeah I mean I come for
you silently and long-term
when people just haha oh wow
cuz I do that's such a good question
haha yeah oh my god if i text Katie huh
lol I take its soul she takes it like as
if I were to text her K Oh Mike K with
like a period or something like it's
just so different if we were gonna say
ha ha to me at least give me 3 cuz I
know I was funny enough to deserve at
least 3 whatever I said I'd rather send
her like 20 crying emoji faces then send
her an lol because she will rip my head
away she is crazy you're crazy
should you ever see each other naked as
friends they do have I ever seen her
naked no no you haven't been lucky

chosen if we weren't doing YouTube what
career would we choose I'll just be
