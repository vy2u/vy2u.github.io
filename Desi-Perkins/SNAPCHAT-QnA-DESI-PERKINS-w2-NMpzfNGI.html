today's video we're going to be doing a
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A it's kind of in a hot
minute since I've done one I feel like
this is such a good time it's going to
ask whatever questions you have
questions I get asked frequently on my
socials and just put them all into one
little video I'm about to open your
snapchats here and answer all your
questions unless they're dirty my answer
those two actually I don't know all
right let's see here
that was Shady
oh the shady question we started off
really shady here if they were all
hanging off a cliff I can't answer that
I would say Stephen and make him hold on
to cannoli on Harper while I lifted him
up good okay my daughter loves watching
your videos with me as she says you're
her favorite do you and Steven have an
idea of how many kids you want to have
in the future
honey three he says two to three I say -
oh yeah - good but I guess you never
really know that's just like my guest
now but who knows maybe later I'll want
more definitely more than one because I
hide sibling and I love having siblings
I like to use apps like face tune apps
like in light in light is really good
for filter school effect add contrast
whenever I actually have a video on how
I edit my photos it's really really old
but it's pretty much the same I'll link
it down below how do you keep your hair
so healthy I don't think my hair is
healthy is to be honest it's all
trickery what makes people think my hair
is healthy is my extension which is not
my hair somebody else's healthiest hair
my hair is actually pretty broken from
all the bleach I used to do I found a
picture of my hair from back in the day
like two years ago and I was so
incredibly blonde I can't believe I was
that blonde I have broken hairs if you
can see here but I definitely try to use
shampoos that work for my hair if I try
to use a new shampoo and my hair doesn't
blow dry smooth I know that's all
right shampoo for me started using the
waste shampoo and conditioner and those
make my hair blow-dry really smooth
really soft have really curly frizzy
hair naturally have to like give myself
one of those professional blowout which
I also have video on just to make my
hair smooth or else I look like I
electrocuted myself is what I was look
like Katy loves it so she loves when I
look like that damn desertedisland three
makeup products Brandon all okay I would
take the benefit Corral I need eyebrows
okay and you could also use that as a
winged liner if you need to I would
bring my Murad lip treatment a concealer
is a Becca a luminous concealer flight
weight and it gives you that really nice
natural look inspiration for the names
and styles of Yorkie Sony's when I first
got asked to do the key collaboration I
was thinking like dang what are my name
is going to be for the sunglasses played
off the words that I use a lot with you
guys like inside joke type of things you
know I was saying thank you so much
Allah so that's why I named thank you so
much T ysn hi key just because that's
the word that I was using a lot the
Heike sunglasses are like I'm here do
you see me definitely not low-key there
and then on the load I I thought of on
the low because those sunglasses kind of
have like low profile
type of feeling they kind of give off
the vibe of like don't talk to me don't
touch me I'm trying to get somewhere
right now that's what kind of vibe I get
from them which I love I just say hair I
was like okay was desert so we kind of
went with those vibes Katy and I call it
our collab because I asked her opinion
for everything I do like this color I
make her put them on she tests all the
samples for me because I need to see
them on her face sunglasses on my face
when I'm seeing samples I get so picky
and I overanalyze everything I'm like
too hard on myself but if I see them on
somebody else and like whoa those look
really good on you and it makes me happy
so yeah hey girl Netflix obsession
that's so money you guys haven't seen
Grayson Frankie it's just like this cute
kind of gives you like I Love Lucy vibe
that best friend feeling or
bicker but they love each other so much
and it's such a like heartfelt show-hei
favorite afford we'll make a product
like the ones that really stand out to
me our - loriell
pro macro glow foundation line those are
the best foundations in the drugstore
right now in my opini
the Sonia Kashuk highlighting sticks
that you can pick up at Target that one
is really really good the Big Shot
Maybelline mascara if you're looking for
a mascara so the Maybelline age rewind
under under eye concealer can't go wrong
with that those are probably like my
most standout drugstore makeup favorite
hey girl
my brother's currently in the room right
now so I feel like answering this
question would be really awkward but I
feel like I'm a spice in its own like
I'm always spicy so she said how do you
prevent your nose from getting caked up
throughout the day the blotting wipes if
you get really oily those little like
rice paper sheets also the charlotte
tilbury powder is so finely milled at
such a good powder to like take away
shine or smooth out anything around your
nose and it doesn't get really cakey cuz
it's so finely milled it just like makes
everything look brand-new we want to
know how many more dogs they are getting
in the future under you I'm about to
have farm one day a couple of questions
besides other artists where do you get
your inspiration and creativity from for
makeup looks I would say I get my
creativity from artwork when I want to
come up with something different I look
up drawings artists there's so many
opportunities for creativity when I
wanted to do my melting skull I looked
up drawings of melting people melting
girls I looked at drawings of like
skulls it found like all these different
artists that drew these things that were
so crazy but if you try to like picture
them as a makeup look it's just like the
best inspiration and then her second
question was what helps you stay
grounded through the success and your
career I feel like my family definitely
helped me stay grounded
Kendrick Lamar helps me stay grounded I
guess I've never really cared about
things that are Chi realistic I mean
yeah it's nice to have those things I
talked to Steven a lot about when we
used to live in this little tiny house
that was like basically a garage back
house yeah we didn't have a lot of money
but we didn't care and I was like we
were really happy there too like we're
so happy at that point of our lives and
now at this point that it's like someone
said would I rather do my own clothing
line or my own makeup line I think I
would definitely rather do something
more in fashion as far as like my own
line I love to do more like makeup
collaborations with other brands more
fashion wise I would want to have full
control I think girl am I gonna
have a baby I don't know when when the
time is right when God allowed picking
bdb bum bum is like cliche kind of
that's like one of her big pop in songs
that everybody sings all the time but
that is what my first memory of her
really was like my first connection I
guess like with my mom we used to sing
at all cleaning and I was like a little
kid so I say see you need a month um
beauty beauty beauty beautiful enemies
probably when I had a miscarriage three
years ago I'm like really open about
talking about it now and I feel like I
just come to accept and understand why
that was the past that was for me at the
time you know everything happens for a
reason and once when when something
really bad happens to you I think it
really is just God's Way of showing you
you know there's another path this isn't
the right time there's there's just a
reason for everything you know obviously
I was devastated at that point I was
like oh I just I want to be a mom I'll
be a stay-at-home mom and then maybe
I'll become a teacher that's what I went
to college for even though I always
wanted to be in this industry I mean
before social media was a thing I just
wanted to be a makeup artist I went into
like a really really bad place someone I
needed to pull myself out of that place
and I was like I threw all of my energy
into doing makeup like 100% I put all my
energy there this happened and I
wouldn't be here have this career or be
doing this if something else would have
happened maybe my life would be
different and it still would have been
great I mean I would have been so happy
but you never know what's in the cards
for you and so anytime somebody's writes
me on snap and tells me they're going
through such a hard time I'm like just
wait things are going to get so much
better ever it is that your beliefs are
you know it might be life's way of just
guiding you in a different path think of
it that way is what I'm saying I was
definitely defining moment and I think
back to that time in my life all the
time like I'm a lot stronger now I know
that if I want something I can work
really really hard and get it knowing
that about yourself is kind of
life-changing I'm different always up if
we're gonna have kids I'm starting
University make friends with smart
people that was my tip okay how do you
think I met Steven I made friends with
his sister she was the smartest kid in
my class and she was like way younger
she was that smart so I made friends
with her and I shared my food with her
so that she could you know kick me down
just some answers here and there
I was never book smart okay that's one
thing that like I never just grasped on
to
if you're not book-smart that's okay
you're just have to work a lot harder
but I'm street smart you know if you're
one of those then you're good
hey girl
she doesn't even put her Instagram bro
you do for your Instagram right now I'm
really loving the hair shop extensions
these are like the skin West they're
just really thin like you can't feel
them I can have them all the way up here
and I don't feel them and the color
matches my hair perfectly they have all
different types of colors but the hair
shop extensions clip-ins are my favorite
I feel like it's really important not to
worry too much about numbers you can get
really caught up in numbers especially
because it's so saturated right now if
you work hard and you're consistent cut
out good quality work numbers will come
but I think people's questions should
really be like how can I get great
content out there because once you have
the great content people will notice you
I mean people are dying to have new
artists tagged all the makeup brands
that you wear actually act as the photos
that's a pretty good tip and push a
photo and all the tags come up that is
going to ensure that the photo is under
there tagged photos and me I don't under
on my tag photos and that's where I see
all of your guys's work and your photos
wearing high keys and I always go in
there to like and discover you guys
really want me to have kids you want me
to procreate right now is what I think
you know to be honest with you guys I
don't I don't think it like comes is
easy for me to get pregnant I don't know
it's just like me being 100% transparent
like I hope that it happens it's kind of
a hard topic but you know I guess it
will happen God willing when it's meant
to be so what is your favorite brand of
makeup when people ask what my favorite
brand of makeup is I'm like oh my god I
can't answer that because every brand
has something that I love to browse its
benefit foundations
it's like Armani's concealers it's you
know NARS and Becca I wouldn't say I
have a favorite brand if you're talking
about packaging then we can talk about
packing
my favorite brand packaging would be
like narns YSL you know chic lush rich
elite looking I love so many different
brands for so many reasons like dose of
colors for the liquid lipsticks I'm
wearing pinky promise right now I love
their formula so it's like you I can't
pick a brand what's the bad part or the
downfalls of your job that people don't
really talk about much I love my job and
I think everybody no matter what job
you're in has downfalls there's good and
bad to every job I guess I would say
I've become a little too hard on myself
that's probably my worst downfall and I
put myself down sometimes especially on
social media everybody really wants
everything to look perfect kind of sucks
that everything has to look so perfect
because if you leave something like
leave a pimple on the photos all they
talk about in comments is simple like
it's so crazy I guess I wish social
media wasn't so perfect but then if I
try to like not put something out that's
perfect I feel like I get on it
makes me become hard on myself my little
brother's always telling me like I think
you're just too hard on yourself I look
at photos of myself differently now
whereas I was going through like a bunch
of old photos on my hard drive from when
I was in high school and after high
school before I started doing social
media I was so like happy smiling doing
funny faces like I didn't care what I
looked like you know what I mean I was
just so full of just like it was so
genuine and now the way I look at
pictures so differently it's more of
like posing getting the right angle and
it just doesn't give you the same vibe
as you got with pictures back in the day
I think that's when I started smiling
more in my Instagram pictures once I saw
those photos look like I need to smile
more I need to be like just you know
like important to know that not every
relationship is spark all the time okay
it's like impossible Steven and I were
like we're happy but we fight for sure
every couple fights that's normal making
sure that you both have your own
activities especially for Steven is
important that he goes off and hangs out
with his friends and I blog meeting all
my friends because we're together so
often it's like you don't get a chance
to miss each other and then you're so
used to being with each other but it's
funny because sometimes you'll drive me
crazy
you know like
you know and he'll go away for the
weekend and do something with friends
and then I'm like I miss you you know
what I mean I miss him and I think
that's important to like feel like you
still miss somebody's special dates do
special things for each other romantic
things here and there
Stephens really good at that like
keeping the romance being very sweet and
thoughtful no more my brother to hear me
mary lou manizer highlight by the balm
cosmetics I love gilded honey by Laura
Geller I love you know I love the make
up forevers highlight let me find it
actually right here you know make a
firmer be naming their with numbers
and I'm always like donde you know I put
in one of my videos okay I will remember
it soon I also love this Dior highlight
nude air oh one which I have here those
are my favorite highlights right now she
would love to do a squad international
tour Machino the way we're set up right
now like I don't know we have to plan
that squad for one was we learned a lot
of lessons did that all on our own okay
we need help because it turned out
pretty well hopefully an international
one is going to be in the future you've
used for like stemming large pores
foundation for oily skin best primary
villain arch pores is this one clean
slate timeless primer the best for
filling large pores in my opinion oily
skin it's really hard for me to judge
that because I don't have the oily skin
but I put the Loreal Pro matte on my
nose area if I'm feeling more oily and
it always helps me out so maybe that one
I can only live off three foods for the
rest of my life what would they be
tacos okay like the real street tacos
you have to give me all the fixings the
limes carrots the whole thing is all
that okay a fruit bowl if the fruit
man makes them with the Saline all that
I bet so I can get my fruit in but
you'll need it to be with lemon salt
that name last food wha he just it but
it would probably be in and out I love
it so much I'm assuming that I wouldn't
ever be able to gain a lot of weight if
you're asking me that question
perfect world nothing happens if I eat
all that food that's what I would take I
don't all the time everybody in this
industry knows that you can't wonder
percent be positive but I try not to
like put out negative vibes if I'm
having a really hard time with social
media for some reason or another I
talked to Katy about it she helps me
like or vice versa she'll talk to me
about something and then we'll just kind
of make each other feel better and then
move on I don't like to draw attention
to negativity on time as I slip here and
there like somebody will say something
negative and I'll respond and then after
I never feels good about it so like I'll
never say anything really negative to
anyone try to defend myself without
being too negative I try to be polite to
them because I don't you know I don't
want to give them more fuel sometimes
I've even responded really nicely and
then they've apologized which is great I
feel like the days that I snapped less
you can kind of tell because you know
it's hard to just be positive or fake it
then I just want to stay away from
social media I think having a really
good friend to talk to you about your
issues and stuff is like the best way to
go especially when you're in this
industry I feel like if you put so much
negativity out on Twitter on your
snapchat I feel like it just follows you
like negativity follows you if you do
that you know and I never want to draw
attention to it so that's what I do talk
to a friend I like that so fun
every year I've sent like something that
would be cool like a dream in my mind
one of those dreams for this year be on
the cover of like a major magazine I've
always been so into magazines like I
used to buy so many of them and just
stare at the covers and I like love
everything about it that would be
incredible and second bucket list thing
would be I wanna go to South Africa so I
would love to go never no I don't think
so I mean I consider it but I love it
here I love being so close to like the
mountains and also so close to the beach
I'm Holly wouldn't move continuing to
inspire women everywhere and keeping it
real over time that was really sweet
this is easy it's funny because like
being latina I got bullied a lot for
being too skinny about having any curves
when I was in junior high especially I
mean I'm I don't know why people are so
great on curves in junior high you're
like 13 I got made fun of for not having
any boobs I got made fun of for being
too skinny at one point and doing your
high remember I would wear like two
pairs of pants because I was tired of
being called too skinny just so I looked
thicker isn't that so
crazy it was a huge insecurity for me
because I think people have these
expectations that like oh you're latina
you have no curves like you should have
this you should have that it's kind of
like well I don't steal from time to
time like I wish I had more curves like
I have to pop my hip basically as my
socket when I take Instagram pictures
that's why I workout really like a lot
like I want to build more muscle mass
and I'm not so insecure about it as I
used to be it still triggers something
in me because these roles were so me in
high school to me like they would bully
me so hard it would come home crying
like they would follow me behind my back
and like yell things about my
and like make fun of me I brother had to
go to my school and put the girls in
their place like tell them like don't
ever talk to my sister like that since
they've apologized which was nice
like to get an apology it's a very
sensitive topic for me
so when people comment like oh go eat
something or oh you're so skinny I'm
like I do eat I feel like body shaming
whether you're bigger smaller shorter
taller you know it can be hurtful I'll
just be here while you got to inseminate
me right now you know what I read guys
that so that is it for the snapchat Q&amp;amp;A
hope you guys enjoyed this video I love
doing these every once in a while I
think it's fun
intimate up in heel so I will see you
guys my next video bye hey Kara
fire-roast Katie and John oh you're here
I do I know she was in my home how long
have you been here really what's that
say hi I didn't even know she's in my
house around I just cruised right in my
chicken cancer one more here everyone's
trying to try inseminate me right now a
girl that's like the only question I'm
getting so we knew I felt like do you

the snapshot Q&amp;amp;A for today Katie will
