welcome welcome welcome so today's video
is gonna be about how this bar of soap
changed my life real story I forgot I
brought gel on my latest trip and I was
like huh what am I gonna do because I
need eyebrow gel to do my eyebrows like
I just can't not have it and I've seen
videos online that other youtubers have
made all about soap brows but I wasn't
sure if it was like a gimmicky thing or
if it was just like let's try this other
experiment but then I was like let me
hit that one time let me see if the soap
bra thing is legit absolutely is
phenomenal amazing probably don't really
need to ever buy eyebrow gel ever again
and this is my cheaper wait cheaper the
concept behind soap brows is that it
basically acts in place of a eyebrow gel
it tames your eyebrows exactly how you
want the hairs to go I was talking with
Katie the other day and she was like I
can't get my brows to go straight up and
almost like girl let me tell you how
long get that so run it through your
brows and it's gonna change your life
and it did she also is now on board with
the soap bro so I know a lot of you guys
have been asking me what I've been doing
differently with my brows and I love
doing brow videos for you guys
especially when I changed my technique
so I'm gonna demonstrate to you guys how
this bar of soap will change your life
you're interested in this video keep
watching oh it's frightening to see my
brow bald like this we're gonna change
that we're gonna fix it as you can see
in Exhibit A the brow hairs are wild and
reckless so what you need is a bar of
soap clear soap works best I've used a
white soap before it does leave it a
little bit of a white residue so clear
is best the one I have is just this
clearly natural got it from Vons
and then you're also going to need a
spoolie any spoolie that you have lying
around this is really simple I dampen
the spoolie I'm gonna use fixed bus
because I'm not walking my ass to the
sink it's too far I'm in front of these
lights make sure it's nice and released
and then you're gonna take your bar of
soap with your spoolie and you're just
gonna graze the spoolie into it I would
recommend using just like a little bit
of soap when you first start out that
way you understand like a texture
and what it's doing once you have some
of that soap on your brush tame your
brow hair is exactly how you want them
to go if you want your brow hairs to go
this way then just swipe them that way
but if you want them to have that nice
editorial fluffy look you see that those
upward pears some people are into it
some people aren't I'm a fan and I think
it looks really good if you have a full
brow you don't have a lot of sparse
areas like this this is gonna make your
brows look phenomenal with no effort
you're just going to be doing this and
you're done as you can see instantly it
just stuff my brow hairs exactly where I
wanted them to be but sometimes if I'm
feeling a Messier brow I will tame these
hairs kind of like this way this way and
then the front ones I'll go like inwards
like this this is so good for editorial
photoshoots whatever whatever it is and
another thing is that you can actually
use this in special effects makeup so if
you want to cover your brows and lay
them flat without using glue cuz I know
a lot of people use a glue stick you can
use soap instead because it lays your
hairs really flat so super easy
everything's nice and coated boom look
at that brow tamed once you finished
combing the hairs in the direction that
you want them to go you're gonna let
them dry for a few minutes
not a few I usually like wait one minute
for them to dry because if you try to
apply an eyebrow pencil over the damp
brow hairs it's not going to work out
for you it's gonna be messy and you're
just gonna be reckless so give it a
second let it dry excuse my under-eye
creasing I've been in this makeup all
day so I'm a little expired if you will
the eyebrow pencil I'll be using is the
benefit precisely my brow pencil in the
shade number four I clearly have some
balding areas so I like to kind of go in
and start lightly stroking the brow
hairs in the direction that I
my edges in then I'm going to make a
small line under the brow just like I
usually do to guide my shape so I just
kind of connected this shape down here
and obviously I'm going for a more
fluffy messy brow so you can definitely
make it less messy regardless the
soproud technique is gonna be great for
holding stubborn brow hairs in place so
I lightly draw out the shape and all I'm
doing now is filling in the gaps in
these same direction as I laid the hairs
down and I'm using such light pressure
because I don't want anything to look
too harsh for this particular brow style
you can still use your spoolie to kind
of comb through and blend out the
product
I think these fluffier Messier type of
brows are going to be you the next brow
style that we gravitate towards which is
great because it takes less time to do
then my more defined brow alright so
that's pretty good that's pretty good
I'm taking some concealer on an angled
brush cuz I don't want it to look too
concealed I don't want that really harsh
like concealer line though so I'm just
gonna start feathering and cleaning it
up I think my eye lashes poppin off but
you know my brows are good mm-hmm
alright so I just finished a filling in
the brow and it looks so clean all the
hairs look very defined they're not
going to go anywhere the bottom line to
this video is that soap is everything
for the brows it's just gonna hold them
in place it's like a Victoria's Secret
level 5 push-up bra for your boobs but
it's for your brows just everything
especially if you have those hairs that
kind of like grow in all different
directions this is gonna be money for
you let me know what you guys think of
this brow do you like this messy brow I
have a hard suspicion that these kind of
brows even messier than this they're
gonna be in they're gonna be popping
it's gonna be the thing that's it for
this little lifehack video I really hope
that you guys liked it let me know if
you've tried it and what you think of it
and I'll see you guys in my next video
yes oh sure so just put in my favorite
laughs ahh as you can see it oh my god
my pinky doing something weird there
well let me know what you thought about
it in the thumbs you know thumbs you
guys are gonna make one of my thumb's
again you see I was gonna say bye
