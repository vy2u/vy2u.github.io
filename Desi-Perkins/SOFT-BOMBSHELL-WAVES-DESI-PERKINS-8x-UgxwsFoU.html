today's video is going to be a hair
tutorial it's been a long time since I
have done a hair tutorial and this is
kind of something that I've been wearing
lately and I absolutely love this
hairstyle it's like one of my favorite
hairstyles as of last week and I knew I
had to film it for you guys right away
it's super easy to do - the extensions
in this video I'll show you how I
install mines to install how I
I guess install right you install here
and this is day three old hair so I'm
going to give you some tips on how to
work with dirty hair okay you guys are
interested in the products I'm wearing
on my face here I have a video coming
out on this makeup tutorial it's going
to be the next tutorial that I put up
it's gonna be all on this makeup look
and I share some of my tips that I
learned from Patrick tah he's a
celebrity makeup artist so I'm really
excited about it so wait for that video
to come out and let's go ahead and get
started with this tutorial I'm gonna go
ahead and use this way dry shampoo foam
I take about this much I don't wanna get
too crazy and what you do is run this
through your roots all I do is I just
start running my fingers through the
crown of my head and I actually just rub
it in until I feel like it's not in a
mousse texture anymore really rub it in
until it like dry though
and then look at what happens or
voluminous people or voluminous my hair
looks really crazy right now I am aware
you know my hair is like super super
super crazy-looking so see how that gave
us a whole set of volume that's what we
want I'm going to take the front of my
hair pull it down put the rest back this
is an important step for this hairstyle
I feel like because you want to have a
nice swoop to your hair whether you have
short bangs or long bangs you can do
this if you don't have bangs just pull
the front of your hair down whichever
part is going to swoop right because
that's important for this hairstyle so
I'm going to take the brush and blow
this out in a downward and inward motion
so that I get a lot of volume so here we
go
so then after you've done that you get
this nice little McDonald's swoop so as
I'm styling my hair I'm gonna flip my
bangs over the opposite direction of how
I want my flip to go once I'm done it's
going to give you more volume it's going
to set like this so that when you go
like that you have more volume does that
make sense makes sense to everybody
okay cool want to go ahead and put the
rest of my hair down and for this look I
use extensions and these are from the
hair shop is for 18 inches but I cut
them shorter because I wanted a more
shorter looked a really nice because
they are super thin wefts thinner than
most extensions they have a lot more
Brown in them than my last extensions
did so they match perfectly with my hair
color I will put in the description box
the hair color the type and everything
I'm going to just clip these in starting
from the bottom and working my way up to
the top I like to give my hair a little
tease when I clip them in boom when I
start by using this 3 clip left at the
bottom ideally you want a straight part
in the back of your head but I kind of
just you know eyeball it with my hands
and pull for the best I think really
when clipping in extensions the best
thing is to give it a little tease at
the root so that way they sit
comfortably and you don't feel like it's
pulling on any little hairs because if
you do it without teasing it it just
kind of sits on your silky hair and
sometimes it'll pull on little hair so
you want something for it to hold on to
this is another 3 clip weft but i'm
flipping in i will say i feel like one
pack of these these come in 6 i felt
like it wasn't enough hair so i had to
get a second pack you have naturally
thick luscious beautiful hair 1
you're very lucky and 2 you're not going
to need to do this step you can go ahead
and skip this step so I'm just over here
with all my broken rooster hairs you
know when you choose your hair
teasing isn't always the best thing for
your hair but I don't cheese up and down
I just tease up and that's gonna avoid
more breakage do you see this this is
why you don't over bleach your hair
because stuff like this starts happening
we don't want this PSA for all of you
out there alright so here we go with
this one
boom so I have two of each of the clips
if you buy one pack you only get one
three clip one four clip or I have this
trick that I do also with my extensions
and my broken hairs if you guys struggle
with broken hairs as well sometimes I'll
take like these little broken hairs for
example if I don't want them sticking
out all over the place I'll kind of tuck
it back into this and then clip the
extension right there do you see that so
that broken hair will never like come
out in pictures that's my tip for
everybody I just started doing that and
it's been working really great for me
okay so now we have these two clip
left's I'm gonna put this two clip left
over heal and you clip in your
extensions as long as you're not
clipping any hair that's held up you're
going to be fine if you put a clip on
top of hair that's going up once you put
it down it's gonna like stick out and
it's gonna look all crazy so teasing and
really making sure you're not on any of
this hair that's up is the key in my
opinion this is multiple tutorials and
one cuz you know this is how to style
dirty hair extensions and then also the
hairstyle itself oh we have all our hair
clipped in I decided which way my hair
wanted to part I know my hair's
temperamental I don't really decide
which way it wants to part it decides
which way it wants to part so if your
hair is like that as well then just keep
that in mind play with it and see which
way it looks better if you guys notice I
already have that swoop and that's from
the blow-drying and that's very key to
this hairstyle in my opinion now I'm
going to go into the curling of it I'm
going to part about half of it up and
just flip it back the curling iron that
I use is also key like this size I'm
gonna have to put in the description box
what size this is but this is from
Conair I love cheaper curling irons I
just feel like they always come through
for me and this one I love it so much
because it gives the perfect soft wave
it's not too tight not too loose it's
just perfect
this one is Conner infinity Pro so I'm
going to grab one section of my hair
this is about an inch to an
inch-and-a-half chunk of hair
and I'm going to place the barrel closer
to the top and give it one twist away
from my face
and hold it for like a second or two and
then slide down to the next inch slide
down to the next inch and kind of just
run it all the way down but keep the
least amount of heat on the ends like
I'm kind of just driving by the end it's
a quick drive-by this is what we're
looking for this kind of curl it's very
effortless it's almost like a blowout
type of curl let's try this again start
with the clamp at the very top almost
away from the face hold it there for a
few seconds this is where I hold the
curling iron the longest because the top
is where I want most of the volume and I
slide it down slide down the rest is
really quick and then barely any at the
ends very soft romantic let's do this
bottom piece and it's a quick hairstyle
to do it takes not that much time at all
because you're not holding the curling
iron for that long so holding it the
most here away from the face and then
once I get to the end I just slide it
through moving to the other side
we're gonna take this from the top away
from the face holding the most heat here
it's like a drive-by curl okay like boom
boom great thing about this hairstyle is
that it looks so good next day it looks
even more effortless and then you could
just run through the curling iron really
quickly for the top pieces and just
touch it up if I didn't have to clip in
the extensions it would take me just ten
minutes if that like I just run through
so fast the less you try the better the
curls look and I do all the curls in the
same direction you could actually do
them all in the same direction or if you
want a different type of look you could
do some away from your face and some in
towards your face it's going to look
really pretty if you guys want to try
that as well as you can see here this is
the effect that we have going on and I
don't use any hairspray because I don't
really like hairspray but if your hair
needs it then use it but I just I can't
stand hairspray in my hair I just don't
like the feeling but I'll show you what
I do use instead
I kind of do this little you know Shh
with my fingers I don't know why but I
just see hairstyle let's do it to me
when they do my hair so I'm like let me
do it as well see what happens you don't
want a super tight curl you want this to
look effortless so that means that you
want a lot of space in between the curls
so for example the hair here is really
close together that's not what you want
to do because that's going to give you
like a tighter curl we want a more
effortless curls so what you're going to
do is hold it at a diagonal and if you
see here there's like a lot more space
in between the two curls I feel like
that's the common issue with a lot of
styles is that they'll hold the hair too
close in the curling art not a bad thing
but it's not what you want when you're
going for effortless curls you see
what's happening here things are
happening starting to shape up at the
top of my hair since I have such short
pieces here so I don't want to curl the
base of this every other hair up until
the top I've started really closely to
the root but I feel like when I try to
do that at the top my short hair becomes
shorter and it doesn't really blend with
the extensions all that well so I like
to start at the very bottom just in this
section because I don't want the top of
my hair to be super curled I get these
broken hairs mix them with my extension
hairs twist them a little bit use this
friction method I don't know what it is
but I twist them together so that they
kind of blend into each other and give
me that like windblown type of look see
I'm saying let go there's a fan under me
so now we're moving on to this side this
is the last part of the hair same
technique I just put my bangs back right
now so that I could get to all these
hairs underneath
I'm not putting a lot of heat on the
bottom of my hair but I still run the
curling iron through the bottom because
even with beach waves like the last
thing you want is like a curl and then a
straight end you kind of want it to fall
naturally like you don't want it to look
like pin straight with like a really big
curl right you want it to have a flow
all the way down so even though these
ends are straight they're not going just
straight they're going with the curl but
just straighter than the rest of the
curl alright now we're putting down the
bangs and look at what the bangs look
like and this is purely because one we
used that dry shampoo foam which gave us
a lot of volume but also because we
round brushed it and that's going to
give you that swoop the way I round
brushed it that's a very important key
to this hairstyle you could even take a
curling iron be very careful but like
run it through your baby hairs up here
if you have any going on and the only
place I would put hair spray if I'm
going to would be in this area to kind
of hold down baby hairs but I don't put
it throughout the rest of the hair you
want to run through one time do this
little Shh
senri taught me this she does this to my
hair honestly I'm pretty sure she has
like some type of product in her hands
when she's doing it but I just do it and
it makes everything look better thank
you so much and then this is the last
and pretty much the only thing I put
down here in this part of the hair it's
the orb a dry texturising spray I think
this stuff is just magic in a bottle
this is going to give you that like
messy tousled look this is what
mary-kate and Ashley Olsen always used
in their hair you know when they had
that like Bed Head look and it was all
the rage this is what they use this
stuff is so good so I could have just
lift and sprayed on the undercarriage
all right I'm pretty this is it I think
I'm done so this is the finished hair
look I love this hairstyle so much it
literally is just so feminine it's so
pretty it's easy to do you can wear this
hairstyle for three days straight I
swear and touching it up is going to be
so easy to do because it's quick so let
me know what you guys thought of this
video and if you want more hair tutes
this is one that I'm really really
liking right now if you do recreate it
tweet me your photos of your hair I'd
love to see how it turned out and if
those little tips really do help you
guys yeah that's everything so I hope
you guys like this video and I'll see
you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
