the city videos going to be this makeup
look that I thought would be really cute
for Coachella it's just it's simple but
it's a little bit funky and different I
feel like for Coachella you can kind of
step outside the box and do quirky fun
types of makeup look and everyone loves
it I saw this image that Linda Hallberg
did I love for you guys I know I talked
about her lava she's just so incredibly
talented and creative and I saw her do
this makeup look where she had clusters
of these little stars all over and it
was incredible so I drew some
inspiration from that and then some
other like Coachella eat looks that I
saw even if you don't do anything else
with this look like the silver paint the
stars with any makeup look would just
look super cute especially in the
sunlight these stars to the legs little
beams of light kind of coming off your
face I hope you guys enjoy this video
let's go ahead and get started so I have
two primers here that I want to try we
have the lorac light source three and
one illuminating primer translate and
then we have the our black veil mineral
base which has SPF I go with the lorac
light source because I want this look to
be very luminous and this is also a face
primer foundation additive highlighter
3-1 shake a little bit of this we're
going to apply it oh yeah
we're not supposed to apply it there but
hey there so this is like an
illuminating primer I want when the Sun
hits me at Coachella I just want a beam
from within this is a shade desc
by the way I was a little concerned that
the highlight part would like
essentially pores but I think it looks
fine
so for foundation I'm going to be using
the naked skin one-and-done this has SPF
so it's good for daytime events like
this and it's a hybrid complexion
Perfector to remains a lot of that a lot
of it of that what I'm going to do is
put it on with a small face buffing
brush this is a morphe g40 she's going
to let that into
in all over it really covered any acne
scarring and pigmentation right away
anywhere you want more coverage with
foundation or concealers you want to
make sure to patch over those areas like
buff but then kind of Pat over it to
really pack that product in that area
foundation looks really good with this
brush and I don't even use barely any of
it this is another new product for me
this is the eight cosmetics bye bye
under-eye eye lift in a tube with their
bye-bye under-eye original is really
really good so I'm going to try this as
two ends
correcting concealer side and then a
brightening illuminating side so I'm
going to go wrong with the correcting
concealing sensors that already
brightens a lot I can't imagine what the
brightening side does I'm just going to
put it in this inner part see I though
this isn't a shade and that's got me
looking pretty woke alright so next
publish it I have my Netflix on oh I
always have my Netflix on one film so
next time you use the RCM a setting
powder this is a translucent powder and
it's going to lightly put that under the
eye so I wore this the last two days
yesterday's Stephens sister got married
and I was so beautiful I was this
tonight before that and on the day of
the wedding and I swear my concealer
lasted way longer
I didn't look like like by the end of
the day I thought I was going to look
like the tail of the Kris the
Cryptkeeper but I looked normal my under
eyes looked fine
so I think I have made a switch to this
powder
I didn't bake with that on dry powder
either on the wedding or the net before
and it looks really good lightly pressed
it I was surprised that my makeup lasted
so long because I did my makeup really
really early in the morning so that I
could go to the wedding and do my
sister-in-law's makeup for she was the
bride I did her wet makeup and then I
did my mother-in-law's makeup and I was
just running around all day and I didn't
really touch up I think I touched up one
time with like like powder over my nose
but besides that nothing and my makeup
stayed all day I actually mixed the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte with the
Armani
magical this is really long-lasting
actually an allergic reaction and I
thought that it was this but I was
I used to wear this all the time is it
this I decided to try it again and it
wasn't this we haven't broken up so
we're good all right what am i doing
Nick oh my gosh dude yeah that primer is
incredible okay look at my high point in
my face
I have not applied high light yet and my
skin is lit all right do you do this
I'm telling you that looks really good
we're gonna stream to highlight I
believe and we want to be lit okay we're
going to be Louis litt so like I used in
my last video I'm going to go in with
this iconic London illuminator and I'm
going to apply that with my Beauty
Blender I like to really blend it first
on the back of my hand before I put it
on my face because you dip it directly
in and just go straight on it might look
a little crazy but once you really blend
it in it starts to look a lot nicer you
can turn your beauty blender around to
to get the edges and blend them out as
well also want to put this a little bit
above the brow bone I'm also going to
apply it right here on the tip of the
nose and I think I'm going to take a
smaller concealer brush so that I could
put it right here on this highlight of
the nose this is more of a fun festive
look so I'm kind of doing extreme
highlights it's going to be over the top
I'm kind of highlighting like as if I
was looking at a painting and there was
like really really highlighted high
points on the face of the painting so
just light beaming is what I'm going for
you can always go back in with your
foundation brush and like buff out any
of the edges just so that it looks
seamless and not streaky I'm also going
to put this on my clavicles let's just
put it everywhere this is probably the
exact skin routine I'm going to do when
I go to Coachella and I'm going week one
I can't wait I'm also putting it on the
Cupid's bow and it's a super dramatic
highlight here okay this highlight is
pretty dramatic on its own and I want to
make sure to set it so that it doesn't
slide around throughout the day which I
don't think it will because it does dry
but just in case I'm going to set it and
I'm going to use them
Tuesday's highlight and this is you
light up my life see these are baked
highlights baked highlights usually
aren't as like BAM you know they don't
give you the biggest glow but it's going
to be really nice over top of this
because this is already giving us that
glow and this has a really nice Sheen so
I'm just going to apply this more for
setting since we already have the
intensities and I'm just using a fan
brush here this is going to give
everything a really nice golden look -
like I said foundation brush nearby
so I could make sure the edges are
blended cuz you're gonna be in sunlight
why make sure everything is really nice
seamless so now you can go ahead and set
any part of your face that gets oily for
me that's my nose I found that this is
the best powder to touch up throughout
the day this is a Charlotte Tilbury
flawless finish I'm in the shade number
two which is medium I just kind of press
it onto the apples of my cheek and my
net size of my nose the nice thing about
this powder is that you can continue to
touch up your face all day and it
doesn't get cakey it like is so finely
milled that it just takes away the shine
and that's it also just going to place
that right here on the center of my
forehead next I'm going to be using
benefits hoola bronzer this is a really
great bronzer I know everybody talks
about it all the time but I've recently
just arted using it a lot and I really
really like it I'm taking this large
fluffy NARS brush and just applying this
right under the highlight and kind of
carving into the highlight like this
softly and I'm going to go in with
bronzer you know don't forget stick it
up to the forehead as well for this
makeup look I'm really spending most of
the time on the skin not so much going
to be the eye makeup I want the skin to
just be glowing beaming living and more
than usual I'm also going to take visual
a bronzer and we're going to accentuate
the Cupid's bow because we want it to
look deep a little super fun defined
thank you take the Smith brush I find
it's perfect for this contouring the
Cupid's bow I saw Katie do dissing her
ly face chart pain video and I was one
of those moments where my mind was groan
because her stupid bow looks so good so
now you know I've been doing it lately
hoola bronzer is great for this you just
wanted to like make it look nice and
defined don't go too crazy though but
you know just just a little also any
is colonic on Seminole and everything
one misses with a Smith's 247 brush now
we're going to hit it once on here on
the nose and I'm starting up here in
this inner socket pausing it right there
and I'm also going to brush that up into
the brows this is why I haven't done my
brows yet because I need to really work
on the skin and I don't want us to worry
about working around my brows and then
taking a smaller brush I'm going to use
this on the tip of the nose to define it
as well the brows I'm using the benefit
Cabrillo number fold this one is just
foolproof it lasts the longest it's not
going to rub off or catching on me I'm
just gonna run a little brow gel through
them really quick then we're going with
it I'm just going to use the brush that
comes with it and try to do some hair
like strokes starting with like the most
sparse area that I have here and make
sure I have a fully close by to brush
through it soften it up now we're done
with our brows we're going to move on to
the eye shadow I want to be more of a
simple look like I said there's a lot
going on with the skin and then the
silver is well so I'm taking the Mac
24-hour eyeshadow base and just a
cosmetics chic eyeshadow brush and I'm
going to run this along the lid to
prison lid we're going to be using not
very many eyeshadows maybe even just one
we'll see how it goes but I'm going into
the Urban Decay moondust palette and
I'll be using lithium which is the shade
right here it's really pretty it's like
topi and it has really nice reflex in it
so I'm going to actually just take that
lithium shade on my finger I find that
these pigments apply better when you
apply them with your finger than a brush
there's actually a lot darker than I
anticipated it to be but we're going to
make it work so now I take a flat brush
and blend this out trying to keep most
of the pigment in the center that's
where I did the finger swatch and then
blend this out everywhere and what's
pretty about these eyeshadows when you
blend it out all the reflux blend so
when you're going to sunlight it looks
so sparkly and pretty
these lights don't show glitter as well
because they're softer but you know I
mean like just imagine being the Sun oh
yeah her fiance was here she's loved
we used to look in the snow that this
shadow looks popping outside of this
light now I'm going to go into the baked
brown Talent this is my dose of colors
and I think I'm going to - this shade
right over here this is a depth of color
simple brush and I'm just going to smoke
the lower lash line with this taking a
blending brush a clean ish one and I'm
going to make sure that's all diffused
and I'm also going to take that shade
right here into the brow bone kind of
where we applied the bronzer earlier I
just really like intensify it more in
here and then whatever's left over just
push it in the crease the next I'm
taking makeup geeks americano on a Mac
two to eight I'm going to just apply
this right here in the center of the
under eyes
we've changed directions here I said the
eyes were going really simple but that's
before I saw how the eye shadow looks on
my lid when I try it on my hand I feel
like it wasn't as dark I mean it's not
that dark but you know we're making
different moves here
blending it out with that pencil brush
we used earlier so now we're taking the
Lancome doll lashes mascara applying a
light coat next I'm just going to apply
house with lashes iconic lights these
are perfect because I can't really feel
myself wearing these and they are very
fluttery and snuffy I'm just going to
come up from the top next we're going to
go into the makeup forever flash palette
and I'm going to be taking the silver
which is right over here just like a
cream paint and I'm using a sigma angled
pixel concealer brush now I'm very
nervous because I have to get a straight
line down my face right now
so let's all hold our breaths and hope
for the best here we go
I'm also going to like sit a little down
here I'm just going to go ahead and uh
put some brown liner in my waterline
this is the Marc Jacobs I'm just going
to run it through lower lash line I got
these little stars from Joanne's and I
just put a tiny bit of duo lash glue at
the back and I'm gonna line them up with
my people and fit them already right on
here so I'm taking these baby stars here
they're a little bit smaller than needs
to go or right out here
lastly I'm gonna use artist couture lip
gloss so one looks sloppy
and then of course you can use some
setting spray alright so this is the
finished festival makeup look I love
these little stars if you guys don't
like the line because another line can
be a little bit different so if you
don't like the line you could just do
the stars and any real makeup look I
just think these are really cute for
Coachella you just pick them up at your
local craft store and yeah they just
look really really cute especially in
the sunlight you can put them over your
highlight area or whatever they're just
so cute so I hope you guys like this fun
video and I'll see you guys in the next
one bye
cause my channel over here it's not
right yeah
no it's not good just comply to inject
me huh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
