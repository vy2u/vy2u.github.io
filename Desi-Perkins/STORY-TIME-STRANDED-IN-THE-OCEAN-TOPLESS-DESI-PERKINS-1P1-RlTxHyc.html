so you look drunk cannoli are you drunk
good daddy
so today's video is gonna be a story
time video this is my first one so I
might suck at it I love watching his
story time videos I think they're fun
and different and just a little more
relaxed I don't like you get to know
people a little bit more there's one
story in particular that I've hinted at
but I never really told the full story
and I said you know I won't get into it
but we're gonna get into it today cuz
why not
today's story is gonna be called
stranded in the ocean topless
listen no judgement here okay this was
like back in the day when I was young
wild and free and just living my life
with no consequence
anywhere here I didn't even think about
consequences I don't think about
anything I was just like yeah let me
paint the picture for you okay me and
two of my friends went to Belize this
was my first time I was super excited it
was my friend's birthday we were gonna
go for a little vacation it was gonna be
so great it all was really great until
Dave her birthday we had met two guys on
the island they were like hey yeah we're
all going out on a boat do you guys want
to come out on the boat with us it's
gonna be so much fun I was like hell
yeah I want to go out on the boat so it
was me two of my girlfriends and two
other guys set sail into the sea at one
point we're in the middle of the ocean
and we're like yeah let's just go in and
swim around and they had Spears with
them when they went in the water they're
like yeah it's good to have that because
there's a lot of sharks here and you
just just to protect yourself you never
know and I was like what sharks so after
we get out of the water we got back into
the boat we're parting we're having a
good time we're having a lot of drinks
and then at one point all of us decided
like oh we got a pee you know and where
else do you go you're in the middle of
the ocean you got to get out into the
ocean we were like yeah let's go pee
one of my friends goes to dive off and
like I pulled her swimsuit top she was
like oh my god I don't know why because
you know I was reckless and then I
jumped in and my friend did the same
thing to me the other friend and here we
are all in the water we're just like
thinking we're on girls gone wild ER
then one of the guys jumps in the water
to the other guys still on the boat
we're thinking we're just gonna jump in
jump out really quick out of nowhere the
last guy on the boat jumps out into the
water and I guess the boat was still on
we're just in there like dumbasses
swimming having a good time next thing I
know I turn around and I'm like oh my
god the boat is far it's a good question
the one guy that jumped off the boat
last was like oh I didn't turn the
boat off he starts swimming towards the
boat I he like it's at the point where
there's no way you could catch up to
that boat even if you tried he swam and
he kept swimming and it got to the point
where I couldn't see the boat I couldn't
see him anymore
I'm a terrible swimmer by the way like I
suck so I'm there the whole time just
treading the water like look a little
duck my other two girlfriends are doing
the same thing and we have one of the
guys with us he is super tall taking
turns holding each of us up because
we're getting so tired he would hold up
my friend for a little bit so that she
could take a break and then he would
hold up me and that he was just trying
to help us out because we were exhausted
I want to say like an hour went by and
we're in the water
finally we decided like we have to swim
to shore and the thought of it freaked
me out
because one all I can think about is
sharks I felt like I just wanted to stay
still and to I suck at swimming for me
to get there was gonna take forever
but that was our only option we all
start swimming towards shore we see this
little island in the distance and we're
like let's just start swimming towards
it so we're swimming we're swimming we
get close to shore it's not like a nice
shore where it's like oh you're just
gonna roll up onto the sand it was like
like if there was a jungle underwater
but it was slimy and gross and it was
thick and we had to crawl like soldier
crawl through this nasty like whatever
it was I was so scared that one of my
friends put me on her back and she was
like army crawling because I just froze
I was like like I can't do it I don't
know what's under there I don't know
what's below me I started panicking kind
of having an anxiety attack and don't
forget all the while we're all topless
like idiots anyways we we finally get to
shore thank God we're there and we see
this house it looks like a vacation
house it looks totally empty there's
like nobody around nothing around we
decide let's go see if there's anything
or anyone we can find to get help
because this guy swam for the boat and
we haven't seen him since we see that
there's kayaks on the side of this
vacation house so we were like let's
borrow this person's kayak we'll take it
out to the ocean and we'll bring it back
when we're done here we are we're
pulling the kayak out then I hear this
woman scream inside the house and she
was like honey there's three topless
girls outside trying to steal your kayak
and he comes running out we're like
trying to pull the kayak out the husband
comes running out and he walks outside
and he's like can I help you guys with
something we all dropped the kayak and
we're standing there like this my
friends panicking and she's kind of
crying so she was like oh my god like
she's telling him the story she's like
our friend is stranded out there we're
just gonna borrow the kayak
we don't know where he is we weren't
even speaking he ended up being so nice
he was like you know I have a boat like
I can take you and go find your friend
and it will be a lot faster than the
kayak and we were just so relieved we
were like oh my god please if you could
do that for us that would be so great we
all hop on his boat and this is the most
Awkward boat ride I've ever been on in
my life there we are three of us topless
sitting there just like holding
ourselves like this and he's trying to
make conversation and we were like it
was so awkward as we went to go look for
him we finally saw something coming out
of the water in the distance I guess he
had found a branch that was coming from
the ocean and he grabbed it and he said
that he swears at that saved him Majan
how long he was treading water for and
once we found our friend
we picked him up in the jet boat and
then we went to go find the boat we
found it we got back onto it we think
the guy for helping us save our friend I
think he thought the whole thing was
funny
like he was like these kids and I'm sure
it's a fun story for him to tell and
that was it that was the time I was
stranded in the ocean topless I never
ever have done or taken my top off since
in a public setting ever that was the
one time and one is all I needed I
learned my lesson okay so let this be a
lesson to you and this was terrible all
of it was dumb from the beginning to the
end it was just like dumb decision after
dumb decision although I don't take
responsibility for the boat being on
okay that wasn't my department that was
homeboys department and he just you know
let it go it's okay we were all young
dumb stupid kids but it was it was fun
it was a good time it was a good way for
my friend to spend her birthday I guess
and I'll never forget it that's for sure
hmm great story to tell definitely don't
regret it it's such a good memory we
still laugh about it now we never gonna
forget this trip it's funny that my
friend ended up marrying the guy that
was holding us up in the
that was years ago and then they just
like linked back up and got married so I
think that's funny and all like kind of
came full circle I hope you guys enjoyed
this little video thank you so much for
watching and if you like story times I
mean I got I have stories okay I have
many stories that I could just sprinkle
in embarrassing things I might I might
anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this let
me know if you're into story time videos
