look a little different today this is
actually a collab video with Michelle
Phan Kristie makeup I am Karen O and J
Kista and we all are doing a theme on
the Sailor Moon Black Moon clan so I'm
really excited because I get to kind of
play dress-up you guys have probably
never seen me look like this the
character that I'm channeling today is
pet she's a badass
so if you guys are interested in this
makeup look then alright first I'm going
in with my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot as
an eyeshadow base I'm just going to take
a synthetic buffing brush and run that
over my lid so next I'm going in with a
skin colored eyeshadow I'm using the
color bear from the lock from palette
and I'm just going to run that over my
lid this is going to make it easier to
blend all the eyeshadows next I'm going
to go into my busy art palette here and
I'm going to take this peachy shade with
a blending brush and we're just going to
pop that into the crease and as I get to
this outer corner I'm just an extended
flick it out on the lid I'm going to go
in with the Giorgio Armani eyeshadow and
number nine this is like a cream
eyeshadow it's just going to kind of
glisten light into
so now to kind of elongate my eyes a
little bit I'm going to go in with some
liquid liner this is from NYC we're just
going to try to keep like a nice thin
pad I've been winged but you guys know
how that goes for me every time I try to
do the same way and it just gets out of
control look it I didn't
so next I'm gonna go into my lashes I'm
going to be wearing positive lashes like
iconic now taking C tweezers I'm gonna
pop these on another trick I found with
these lashes is popping them on from a
top so instead of coming at your eyes
like this
with the lashes try to grab them from
the center open your eyes more and then
just kind of go next I'm going to take
some mascara and just apply it to the
base of the lashes so that it blends
with my natural lashes
we're going to do the concealer under
the eye I'm using Avery wines by the
baleen Maybelline just going to Pat that
on to brighten up the under eyes
probably gonna put a little bit on my
nose it's your butt ringing it's okay
I'll allow it
I'm just going to blend out my concealer
using my Real Techniques ghost engine I
think I'm already over here because this
wake Center set the under eyes I'm going
into my honest ostia Beverly Hills
contour kit and taking the banana shade
on one of my new favorite brushes is by
japanesse and it's a 9/16 brush been
loving this for the under eye I'm just
going to set all of that concealer and
it's also going to brighten our under a
little bit to open up my eyes a little
bit more I'm going in with the NARS rue
Bonaparte pencil and this is a skintone
color it also helps with the redness you
have any redness in the energy now I'm
going to pick up a neutral brown
eyeshadow on a small detail brush and
you're just going to really make that
lower lash line pop by shading right
under the liner that we just placed in
our waterline I want to try to focus is
mainly on the outsides of the eyes to
keep them a little bit more and lastly
for the eyes I'm going to go ahead and
pop some mascara on the lower lash line
I'm going to do that off camera because
you know my lashes are so low it's hard
for me to see the focus on your business
angel okay so with her skin I want to
keep it very fresh I'm going in with a
really nice highlighter this one is by
shada Nona but this is in the shade zero
one light and I'm going to apply this
with my Mac 137 I wanted to give a
little more of like an angelic look with
the skin apply a little bit of that on
the tip of the nose so I'm going to just
apply a little bit of bronzer especially
since I have this dark hair going on you
know I want to look too washed out this
is e how do I say this brand girl in
Berlin Berlin Guerlain girl a / this is
in the shade terracotta and I'm using a
Mac 168 brush to apply it now temper the
lip which is what I think kind of pulls
the whole look together I'm going to
first fly my lips using night moss lip
liner by Matt so I just decided I take
my boobs off because they're just a
little bit too large sturdy okay are you
done making fun of me then you want to
put some liquid lipstick on this is my
honest Aussie Beverly Hills and it's
called midnight so now you look
