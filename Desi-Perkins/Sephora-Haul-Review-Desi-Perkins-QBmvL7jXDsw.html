today's video is going to be a different
video for my channel I've actually never
done a haul before and I'm not sure how
I feel about them yet
but a lot of you asked me to do one
because I went crazy at Sephora the
other day so let me know you guys think
these videos I don't want them to come
off as like oh my God look at all my
stuff and I thought you know I don't
really like to come off like that I just
want to share these products because I
was really excited to try them some of
them I've already tried so I can kind of
give you my two cents about what I feel
about them so yeah I think it's like
just kind of like a sharing products
type of video I don't know one day I was
just online shopping one thing led to
another I ended up asked for his website
next thing you know I bottle this stuff
I was in my sweat pants I was wearing no
makeup and no buddy got time to go to
Sephora mmm I'm just gonna go ahead and
start the video so the first thing I was
immediately attracted to was this this
this hourglass highlight palette this is
the ambient lighting palette and I don't
know if you guys will believe me when I
say this but I've actually never tried
an hourglass highlighter ever everybody
on YouTube talks about them how they
give you this beautiful glow from within
I'm more of like a glow from without hey
I could see you from space type of glow
so the glow from within never really
appealed to me but then I saw Jacqueline
Hill use it and I was like oh that's
pretty so I had to pick up this palette
it has three highlighters in one and I
love highlighters so it definitely is
true what they say it does give you just
a beautiful glow from within I would
recommend this to brides I think on your
wedding day you don't want to look so
over highlighted I mean I would this
comes with the shade dim light
incandescent light and radiant light I
really love all of them this one is more
pale this is more of a peachy gold type
of highlight and this one I would say is
a little bit warmer than this one but
still in the neutral family of high
let me know what you guys think of this
highlighter in the comments below I
haven't tried this yet but the next item
is this little NARS eyeshadow I just
love NARS packaging they get me with the
packaging I don't mind that it gets
dirty because when it's new it's so
pretty this is the NARS eye shadow in
the shade
and a lot of people rave about this eye
shadow I'll show it to you guys so it's
bright orange it's more of a rusty
Orange
it's just beautiful and I can't wait to
use this I haven't tried it yet I will
definitely give it a swatch here for you
guys so you could see the color of this
eye shadow let's see it's hard with
these nails to get a swatch I'm like so
it's super orange and really pigmented
that's really pretty it's just super
orange I can't wait to use it in the
crease and just go crazy with it I'm
excited for this eyeshadow NARS
eyeshadows in general they have the most
buttery blendable texture I kind of went
on a little NARS binge this is one of
their oh this is another eyeshadow oh oh
my gosh this is an eyeshadow that
everybody has talked about for years and
I've never owned it and finally I bought
it it's the NARS Galapagos eyeshadow I
actually have this in my crease right
here just at the cut of the crease I
didn't put like a lot of it on I kind of
just used it to you know sharpen up my
crease a little bit but it's so
beautiful oh my god you guys will love
this eyeshadow it is a really nice
chestnut rich brown and it has gold
flecks in it and you know when certain
eyeshadows have gold flecks but when you
try to apply them the gold doesn't
really show this one does shows and it's
really really nice I also have it along
my lower lash line and maybe on camera
you can't see the gold but when I look
closely I can see little gold sparkles
just like under my eyes and it looks so
nice
I love this eye shadow and I can't
believe that I've never tried it ever so
the next item I definitely didn't need
in my life because I have so many
bronzers and highlighters but
what can you do amra posted him I'm
really on Instagram she posted this and
said it was an amazing highlight and
then I was like oh I need it this is the
pro sculpting duo and I have the shade
too like I said you open it up and it
looks like this
it is so beautiful it has a really nice
gold highlight at the top and then the
bronzer at the bottom I've been using
this for about a week and I already have
like a really good grasp on how I feel
about it
so the highlighter is absolutely
beautiful like I'm wearing a little bit
of it now if you guys can see it here
it's so nice and it's gold if you're
into cold highlights
um I I'm sorry I just don't really care
for this bronzing part here I don't
think it's pigmented enough for me and
it just doesn't do anything like
miraculous for me I love the highlight
so I'm like torn because I wish this
whole thing was just the highlight so
that's what I have to say about this but
I'm telling you I think I would buy it
just for the highlighter cuz I'm
obsessive highlighter so highlighter
amazing bronzer the next item is
something that was recommended to me by
a friend and her skin type tends to be a
little bit more oily and her face looked
really matte one night when we went out
and I was like what what is on your face
and she has sworn by this Laura Mercier
matte translucent powder so this powder
is green I don't know why it's green
it's actually translucent it doesn't
come off green I've used it a couple
times and I really like it I don't know
if I don't know if it does the same
thing to my skin as it does for hers I
like it I don't know if I love it but I
just like it I don't know there's really
not much to say about it yeah well I got
another NARS thing I mean I feel like
when I go to Sephora I just gravitate
towards NARS but anyways this I have not
tried yet this is the new NARS one of
these this is the new NARS dual
intensity blush and this is in the shade
craving so it has the sea
little rubberized packaging that all the
other makeup does and then when you open
it it has like a nice little magnet to
when you close it which is nice has
large mirror and I didn't really get a
blush I got more of like a bronzer and a
highlighter and the highlighter has a
really iridescent pinky undertone this
bronzer I would kind of put all over for
that glow I haven't really used these on
my face yet because I've been so busy
with the other highlight and bronzers so
I'm not really sure what my opinion is
on this yet it swatches really
beautifully I actually saw a video by
Julie G and she did a review on all of
these and I was like a little bit
disappointed to see that not all of them
were amazing but this one looks nice so
yeah this is the new NARS dual intensity
craving blush so everyone's been talking
about the NARS audacious lipsticks and I
haven't owned any of them so I bought
two shades and there's so many beautiful
shades it was hard for me not to pick
all of them I decided okay I'll pick a
color that I don't really typically go
for and then I'll pick one that I could
wear more everyday and I thought that
was like a good decision so at the very
first color I got is called Barbara and
Barbara is a really nice Mavi nude color
just good for everyday it's not like a
really really nude you know I'm dead
kind of look it's more of like a I'm
healthy and my lips are full of blood
you know am i explaining this good at
all no the other audacious lipstick that
I got is Greta and this one is
definitely not a color that I would
gravitate towards it's really really
bright but I love it I posted it on
Instagram the other day and it's just
like so beautiful I'm holding it up so
you could see like pretend that I'm
wearing it everything that people say
about these lipsticks is true the
quality of them is just unbelievable
they're not super matte they're more
creamy so if you have like chapped lips
it's just gonna like mmm like butter all
over your lips it's gonna just be so
moisturizing and so pigmented like I
need to get more colors now that I know
how amazing they are
being super sleek super cute and it's
like magnet I'm so easily amused
the next item was recommended to me by
lustre Lux I just all these products are
kind of like recommended or assault on
YouTube so this one was recommended to
me by lustre Lux it's eyeliner by NARS
and this is the larger-than-life long
wear eyeliner in the shade rue Bonaparte
I was looking for a nude liner for the
inner waterline and I'm actually wearing
it now and I didn't realize what a
difference nude eyeliner makes I mean I
know what it does but I never really did
it now I'm doing it and I'm like oh it
looks really good you know it kind of
just makes your eye shadow on the lower
lash line pop and it brightens up your
eyes every time I try to wear white or
nude in the waterline I feel like it
just like fizzles out like it just goes
away my eyes get watery and it's gone
and I'm like why did I even do that and
this one is freakin amazing like it just
stays all day this is like end of day I
filmed another video already before this
and it's still in my waterline it's
still bright and it just looks amazing
so if you guys are looking for something
to put in the waterline to really open
up the eyes I highly recommend this
liner this is the last NARS item I
didn't realize how much NARS I had so
this is the NARS sheer glow foundation
I've already had the NARS sheer glow
foundation this isn't new for me I used
to use it when my skin felt a little bit
more dry this is a super dewy foundation
and this one has 1 fluid ounce in the
bottle let me take it out for you guys
so really quickly before I discuss the
coloring of this foundation I was really
optimistic about how tan I was feeling
and I think I was like a little bit too
optimistic because the shade that I got
is way too dark for me like I was on the
computer and I was like yeah that's my
shading hmm I'm really I'm not tan I'm
that tan right now and then when I got
it I was like I'm not that this
foundation is really really good for dry
skin the coverage is really beautiful
it's medium it lasts a really long time
it's super dewy super glowy so if you
guys have dry skin you're looking for a
new foundation I definitely recommend
this one so like I said I'm gearing
towards some skin you know I want to be
like luminous and
and all that stuff so I got another
foundation that I've had in the past and
it's the Armani luminous silk foundation
now this foundation it just like kills
me to buy it like I know it's amazing
but it's expensive like it's so
expensive but I know it's amazing I've
purchased this before and I absolutely
loved it and I was so sad when it ran
out this is in the shade 7.5 and this is
definitely my correct shade I'm actually
wearing this foundation today I feel
like I have more of a glowy dewy skin
look going on and I absolutely love it
this is also medium to full coverage you
can build it this bottle comes with one
fluid ounce as well the packaging is
really really sleek you know this
foundation is beautiful for dry skin as
well if you have really oily skin I
definitely wouldn't recommend this I
feel like it would just move around a
little bit too much but for drier skin
or normal to combination skin I would
recommend this even though it's so
expensive so the last thing I got was
the Kat Von D tattoo liner um everybody
talks about this on YouTube Instagram
everywhere and I've never tried it
before but I hear it's super black and
the pen looks really easy to use it just
is like a nice little calligraphy is
this calligraphy or felt-tip I suck at
explaining things whatever you guys can
see it looks really really nice easy to
use I haven't tried it yet because I've
kind of been on this no eyeliner thing
like you guys can see I'm not wearing
eyeliner today but I hear amazing things
about it I've never heard a bad review
so I'm really excited to try this
eyeliner it's in the shade trooper which
is just black comes with 0.2 fluid
ounces which is I think maybe you
standard for our liner um but yeah I'm
really excited to try this and I'm sure
you guys will see it in some of my
upcoming videos so Kat Von D tattoo
liner okay so I actually have one more
item here but I didn't buy it I think
Sephora maybe when you purchase things
they send you like a little sample gift
size thing what did I just say they send
you a sample size as a gift there we go
and I got the Clinique foaming sonic
facial soap so I'm not going to try this
until I run out of my current face wash
but I'm curious to know if any of you
guys have tried it and if you have let
me know what you think about it and the
comb
down below a lot of people ask me why I
shop for makeup online and one let's
just say that I don't want to wear
makeup and I want to wear my sweatpants
and eat potato chips and wear my pimple
cream and just shop from the comfort of
my home it's like a thrill you know like
stay at home all day and shop - it's
because you get money back for shopping
well I get money back for shopping
because I use Ebates
and I don't know if you guys have ever
heard of Ebates my mother-in-law and my
husband both like turned me on to it
they actually forced me to do it because
my mother-in-law is like a very you know
like coupon II type of person so eBay's
is basically a site it's like you get a
rebate get it eBay --tz-- so you know
when you go to like buy a TV and it's a
certain price but then you get like a
certain price back that's basically what
this site is so they have a bunch of
stores under the site you go to Ebates
you make an account it's totally free
and easy and I like to shop like Sephora
Nordstrom's altas on their misguided
which is where I get a lot of my clothes
so whatever I buy from each store
there's a certain percentage that you
get back and if I were to go to Sephora
or Ulta and buy something I wouldn't get
anything back they'd just be like here's
your makeup and I love getting money
back it's like a thrill in itself so
when I shop through Ebates I just get
all my money put into my account and
then I can use that money over time to
shop for other makeup items and it's
like why not why I would want free money
why wouldn't you want free money I just
wanted to share that with you eat bases
awesome I'll leave a link down below um
and I think it's like every time you
sign up you can get other people to sign
up for it and they get you get like ten
dollars every time someone else signs up
so if you make your own account you
don't have to make an account through my
account I'm just letting you know I
think that's what how it works because
that's how my mother in law got me she's
like sign up through my emails account
so I think you get like ten dollars I
may be wrong but you get a certain
amount of money if you refer someone
else to sign up I just want to share
that with you guys because any way to
save money is the way to go especially
for us makeup orders out there that's
pretty much everything I have for you
guys today let me know if you guys are
into haul videos because I will keep
doing them because I thought it was
pretty fun I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I'll see you guys next time
bye okay
Salas aye hello oh let me tell you what
this cuff I can't even speak lol I don't
even know what's happening right now
what I suck at these videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
