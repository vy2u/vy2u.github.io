finally filming my skincare routine
video which a lot of you guys have been
asking for
I know I've lagged I'm sorry but I have
a crap ton of skincare it's a lot
everything serves a different purpose I
have combination skin so I'm only in the
t-zone and I'm normal everywhere else
and let's get started
the first thing you want to do
especially if you wear a lot of makeup
like me remove it all with a makeup
remover wipe and this is just gonna help
get everything started and most of your
makeup off I enjoy using the up-and-up
makeup remover wipes from Target those
are actually my favorite they're really
inexpensive and they're comparable to
the Neutrogena makeup remover wipes so
if you guys love those then these will
also work really well and they are half
the price but as good as a makeup
remover wipe is that getting most of
your makeup off it doesn't always get
everything off and I want to make sure
that I have nothing left on my face so I
am obsessed with this Murad renewing
cleansing oil and this is for the eyes
face and lips and then it also removes
impurities irritants and makeup I mostly
use this for makeup because I know that
there's always leftover foundation and I
want to make sure it's all gone so I
take some of this oil and I just wet my
fingers first and apply it to my face
rub it in circular motions and get any
leftover mascara or eyeliner that I may
have left on my skin so after you made
sure that all your makeup has been
removed you want to use a cleanser and I
use the Cetaphil daily facial cleanser
this is for normal to oily skin it
removes excess oil without drying and I
absolutely love it I find that it's a
really nice gentle cleanser and I think
that's the key with my skin is I needed
to be gentle I can't use any acne face
washes so I've been using this for a
while now and I love it
I've switched between other face washes
and as long as they're gentle for the
most part they have worked the same so I
think that's the key just a gentle face
wash so the next product is this Murad
skin smoothing polish and this says it
deeply exfoliates to leave skin soft and
smooth and helps relieve congested pores
so I
recently started using this and it was
actually in my last favorites video I
absolutely love this stuff I think it's
a must like it's a must must must the
consistency of it is super smooth most
exfoliants are kind of abrasive and if
you have bigger pores those exfoliants
can actually get into your pores and
make you break out more this is so
finely milled that it just literally
feels like it's polishing your face yeah
I absolutely love this I use it about
three times a week after I wash my face
and it makes my face feel like a baby's
booty okay
let's go to the next product after I get
out of the shower I always 100% use this
Murad complete reform with the glyco
affirming complex this was recommended
to me by teni
and she told me that it worked miracles
on her skin so I was like okay I'm gonna
try that it basically helps your skin
regenerate faster so if you have dark
spots if you have acne scars wrinkles
all of those things will start to
diminish a lot faster with this I
recommend it you always want to make
sure to moisturize your skin it doesn't
matter if you have oily skin if you have
dry skin if you have regular skin always
moisturize so I have two moisturizers -
I have two moisturizers ones for daytime
ones for nighttime so during the day
I've been using this be fine food skin
care daily moisturizer with SPF 15
making my skin super super nice without
making it oily and it just kind of soaks
into your skin and then it doesn't leave
remnants of greasy moisturizer
I hate moisturizers that do that has SPF
so it's perfect for daytime but my
nighttime moisturizer is another Murad
product and it's the perfecting night
cream and this is also from the aged
reformed line I really like this because
I feel like it's not too thick I find
that this really really hydrates my skin
at night and it's fabulous so I love
this I've been using it it's almost gone
for my eye cream I use its potent by
benefit and I really like this product I
don't think it brightens or anything
like that I'm not really sure if it's
even oh yeah it's
to brighten it says that it brightens
and fades dark circles I'm not sure if
it's doing all of that you know like I
don't know I don't really have the
darkest circles to see if it's making an
improvement I really love the way it
makes my undereyes feel I noticed my
concealer has been going on so much
smoother I find that when I wake up in
the morning my under eyes feel super
juicy would that would that be a good
way to describe it so no matter how good
your skin care is it's inevitable that
we're going to break out every now and
then so it's good to have a on the spot
treatment for those pimples I've been
using this clear clinic vanished clear
spot treatment and I have this tiny
little sample size of it I have been
loving it it smells like it's gonna do
some damage to your pimple like it kind
of has a really strong scent but I'm
okay with it because I put it on my
pimple and then the next day it's pretty
much gone or it's a lot smaller than it
was the night before I found that this
works really good lastly I want to talk
to you guys about face masks and two of
my face masks that I use and they both
serve a different purpose the first one
is the Clara CC salt
charcoal mask this one is amazing if you
get blackheads which I do unfortunately
around my nose it's probably my most
problematic area charcoal mask is really
gonna pull all of that out of your nose
any charcoal mask will do though if you
guys have blackheads pick up a charcoal
mask it will help tremendously
so this mask is something I've recently
started trying and it's by the company
called bliss it's the multi-faceted but
it says face sitted I guess all in one
anti-aging clay mask I love this mask
because first of all its anti-aging and
I'm not trying to get old okay I'm
trying to stay young forever apply a
thin layer to a clean face avoiding the
eye and leaving it on for five to seven
minutes and it says to remove the mask
with a warm washcloth and you're
supposed to do this twice a week which I
definitely do it smells so good it
smells like
at peppermint I'm not almost smells like
like what are those Girl Scout cookies
the chocolate minty minty ones mmm but
it just looks like this I love this face
mask and I recommend it to anyone who
doesn't want to get old which is all of
us okay
alright guys so that concludes my
arsenal of skincare I hope you enjoyed

some of these products work for you guys
