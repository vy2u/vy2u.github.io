and today it's a hair tutorial I did
this hairstyle today really quickly and
I thought it would be a great video to
show you guys how to do a slicked-back
ponytail using extensions so there's
many different ways to do this and I
kind of go between two different ways
but yeah I'm going to show you one of
the techniques that I use so if you like
what you see then keep on watching
alright guys so what you're going to
need for this tutorial is a hair brush
to comb out any tangles that you may
have in your hair
a boar brush and this helps slip back
all of your baby hairs and it just gives
you that really smooth finish
speaking of smooth finish I love to use
pomade when I do a really slicked-back
ponytail because my hair has a lot of
breakage a lot of baby hairs and I don't
use this they'll just like stick out all
over the place the middle like a crazy
bird or something and then you won't
also have some hairspray just to set it
all down hair ties and course you're
going to need some bobby pins and I like
to use ones that match my hair color so
these are like a lady brown chromoly
color and if you haven't already
strained your hair go ahead and do that
I did it earlier today and this is the
infinite Pro Pony or hair straightener
and of course I always use this Tresemme
heat protectant always use heat
protectant it's really important and
last but not least you guys are going to
need some hair extensions if you are
using hair extensions for this look
these are my 22 inch Bellamy chestnut
hair extensions and I overate them with
the with the L'Oreal hombre kit and it
worked fine
a lot of
well don't really care for box ties but
hey fallin on a budget right so yeah
works for me and I love it and that's
actually what I use in my hair if you
guys are curious I use Memorial on great
set
so I forget anything no we're good
let's get started
start by brushing all the tangles out of
your hair
figure out where you want how high you
want your ponytail so this
here so we're going to just take my
fingers if you need to use I can use a
comb like this to part around you can
but the part doesn't need to be perfect
I'm just going to take my fingers and
just kind of pump in a map out like a
circle back of my head show you guys for
in a second so this looks like a good
spot for my ponytail so part does not
have to be perfect whatsoever so I'm
just to kind of taking the hair like
this chunk okay I'm going to tie that
piece you can take your extension and
brush it out and then we're just going
to go ahead and clip around this
ponytail clip in our extensions I'm
going to start from the back so leave
your orange and I'm just going to clip
them up get the clips clipping up
and wrap it around as close to the
ponytail holder as I can
okay then we're going to do the second
left
all right and now take your third weft
and this one's a little bit bigger so
I'm going to try to wrap this one all
the way around the ponytail now and
since I started from the back with the
last two I'm going to definitely start
the front so that I don't have so much
bulk so just when to push a through the
side clip it in
okay
so now we have clipped in all the
extensions onto our little ponytail that
we made so it should look something like
this now what you want to do from here
is basically just grab all the hair and
put it into a ponytail
so I'm just going to flip my hair over
and just kind of lift all the hair up
all right there we go
now I'll just take your your pomade and
put that little corner baby hairs I
actually already had a lot of it in my
hair because I had my ear like this
earlier so I'm just going to put a
little bit more of all the baby hairs
just make sure they don't start going
crazy throughout the day and this is
where you take this brush and slick
everything back really tightly just give
yourself an instant facelift
so I think that is good to know I'm
gonna take my hair tie and just tie that
all back great so now that you have your
hair in a ponytail you're just gonna
hairspray all that down and doesn't have
to be perfect or on the base because now
to kind of hide the bumps and stuff
there we're going to take a piece from
the bottom of the ponytail just like a
one-inch section with staying a piece of
hair around the ponytail and just bobby
pin it as you twist just so it stays
down so now that we've done that we can
just hear some everything just and now
your hairstyle is complete so I hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial and I will
see you in my next video bye guys
I know beautiful alright so we're going
to do first is we are going to I thought
it was weird at first one I kind of
whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
