for today's video we're gonna do
something a little bit different I
wanted to do like an impromptu Q&amp;amp;A video
and I thought since I love snapchat that
it would be really cool to ask you guys
to ask me whatever questions you wanted
through a video snap and then I will
open them here on my youtube channel and
then respond to your questions I saw
Amanda and Singh do this once at one of
her videos I thought was a really good
idea so let's go ahead and get started
how did you learn like how to do makeup
I was always really artistic and I did a
lot of drawing when I was younger so I
think I kind of just translated my
drawings into makeup in a way because
art is very similar a lot of blending
working with colors stuff like that so I
practiced on my own face obviously and I
watched YouTube videos I looked at
pictures and magazines and I would try
to recreate it at home like even if I
wasn't going anywhere I just did it so
that I could get better at it the tattoo
on my wrist says 'create I've set this
in a previous video but yeah it does
create only because I've always been a
really creative person and I didn't know
what I wanted to do at one point in my
life I remember saying like I'll be
happy as long as I'm creating in some
way so that's what that means and that's
what I'm doing so hard to say
I definitely love honest Aussie Beverly
Hills I love makeup geek I love Mac and
makeup forever so those are just like a
few of my faves describe your style in a
celebrity what celebrity would it be by
the way I love you so much
I love you too um celebrity style maybe
like if Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner
like mix their styles together because
Kendall's super classy Kylie's super
wretch and I kind of like both
I started wearing winged eyeliner and
junior-high like 13 years old
black-winged when you're having really
bad cravings for something what is it
usually for you know is that so
obviously you know anytime I want
something about it's either in and out
or fruit like that's a good thing that I
always want but mostly in and out got
something I want she said what's my
favorite holiday bin so what's my
favorite vacation I went on a trip to
Belize and it was awesome and I think
that's still my favorite destination
that I've ever been to
I'm just wondering how you find the
right shade of nude lipstick for you um
new lipsticks are tricky because you
really have to just test for your skin
tone if you have a deeper skin tone you
want to go for the less chalky nudes if
you're more pale you want you can go for
the more chalky nudes like myth looks
terrible on me cuz I'm so tan it looks
like just white so I don't really like
that hi desi I wanted to know what maybe
you want to become a makeup artist I
really was into special-effects makeup
and when Halloween rolled around Stephen
and I didn't have costumes so I was like
well let me try to do some type of crazy
makeup and it turned out really really
good I was just experimenting with stuff
next thing you know everyone was asking
me to do their Halloween makeup all
types of special effects stuff so I
first started doing that like
intensively and then people started
booking me for other things and then I
kind of fell into the beauty thing so
Halloween is basically how I started
doing makeup professionally my favorite
movie is The Devil Wears Prada and I was
born in Culver City my mom's from Puerto
Vallarta and my dad is from Texas his
grandparents are from Spain hi desi I
love you oh your idol when you started
YouTube the first youtuber I ever
started watching who I was like
fascinated by it was Tanya Berg I came
across her video once and I was like oh
my god
I'm in love and the pixie was I think I
first saw Tanya burr on their channel
she's pretty much the person who got me
into watching YouTube videos altogether
the lottery what would your first
purchase be and don't be selfish
girlfriend oh that's easy that's a good
question I think I would buy everyone I
love a house well like everyone in my
immediate family oh and I would buy a
Mercedes g-wagen close my dream car I
wanted so bad what is your favorite
foundation for the summer time if I want
to look matte right now it's the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte foundation and if I
want to look dewy it's the Armani
luminous silk foundation oh that's easy
best powder to set your concealer for me
is the Laura Mercier translucent powder
the texture is very light so you don't
feel super keke under your eyes and it's
good for any skin tone you work out and
if you do what do you do for your abs um
I do eight-minute abs on YouTube it's
like a really lame video but it works
quiero hacer un vídeo en espanol promy
de miedo porque no se como de silicosis
de pintura en espanol basically what I
just said was I want to make a Spanish
video but you know how Selena was she
did all that stuff in Spanish but then
when she had to do interviews she was
like missin thumley excited like that's
what I'm gonna be like if I try to do a
makeup tutorial in Spanish because I
learned Spanish by just hearing it and
going to Mexico and talking to my family
in Spanish but I don't know everything
in the Spanish language so I definitely
don't know like makeup terminology is
what I'm trying to say makeup
terminology I'm not good at so I'm
watching more Spanish videos so that I
get better at it and we shall see
at what age would you let your daughter
wear makeup I would probably let her
wear like mascara and eyeliner and
junior high but no foundation until high
school maybe I feel like foundation can
ruin your skin if you wear it when
you're so young
Hanan doing you two forever I don't know
I wanted you to for as long as I can for
as long as you guys are interested and
watching me yeah thank you all I heard
was my cut crease is on point
oh yeah no questions I'll be at Jen
Beauty New York if you guys will be
there for med school applications that's
important should I do my makeup honestly
I always have a go-to makeup look you
want to do what you know looks good
especially in photos i'ma go with like a
neutral eye winged lashes lots of
bronzer and like a nude lip that's what
I would do but I just want to know if
you were to dye them do they get ruined
at all the Bellamy extensions can be
dyed and it's fine I would get a
professional to do them cuz you don't
want to spend all that money and then
mess them up if you do it yourself
I wouldn't bleach them though cuz you
don't want to bleach the extensions it
just makes them really nappy I mean
that's with all extensions I'm allergic
to acrylic so I get a powder called S&amp;amp;S
it's a lot thinner like if you see my
nails acrylic can sometimes look a
little bit chunkier this is like a very
thin powder I don't know it's just
called SNS natural powder the process is
just like acrylics though so of course
it makes your nails slightly thinner but
I don't find that they're being shaved
down every time I go like I get a fill
it's just like a one time shave down and
so I don't think it's damaging them too
much why don't you just like Katy have
better nails on you for once huh
can you see sweetest person ever she
just matches so why are you not about
Katy
being she Katie are you like is Katie
snapping you guys and telling you to say
things to me huh is that what's
happening
why did you start YouTube and how did
you start it like what did you do to
start PS why do you hate kids Katie this
whole video is gonna be about Katie
because I know she's influencing you
guys right now I already know this I'm
gonna have to play your story too so I
can get down to the bottom of this so I
decided to start youtube because of
Instagram everyone was commenting and
asking me to start youtube so one day I
decided alright let's do this
and Stephen and I sat down and we
already had the equipment because he
used to do photography so we had lights
and stuff and the camera and it was not
smooth sailing like it was hot I was
having heat flashes I was realizing how
difficult it was to do makeup on camera
it's not as easy as it looks like you
don't just sit there and it's actually
really difficult to do your first video
like I don't even think I loaded my
first video because it was just so bad
Katie Katie Katie is ruining this she's
single-handedly ruining my video it is
it oh god I'm gonna say what type of
teeth whitening products you use the
teeth whitening products I use our Crest
Whitestrips for sensitive I use Phillips
nobody cares
oh you use wait what why are people
asking you questions in my video I got
the bed Nasty Gal no he is being selfish
and you should probably watch her
because she's trying on your clothes oh
my god alright we gotta go see what this
couch is up to right now so does he's
about to do a Q&amp;amp;A video through snapchat
so you guys should all send your
question to asking her like why she
doesn't like me or something weird so
make sure you send her a video not a
text
why are you so mean to babies and why
did you put a chip clip in her hair so
send me the video she's gonna be
answering right now terrible this is
basically a collaboration video this is
a collab with Katy um I was already with
to be good at Tom teach my aunt Katie oh
my god I would love to add on to you do
you plan on having kids in the future oh
yeah girl eat that eat that Cassata yeah

yeah of course I like Elsa who doesn't
if I could be anywhere in the world

I don't know why or Dubai with Katy cuz
she really wants to go oh she wants to
go so bad she like literally sends me
photos of us on a plane like a private
plane
she has intense dreams to go to Dubai
