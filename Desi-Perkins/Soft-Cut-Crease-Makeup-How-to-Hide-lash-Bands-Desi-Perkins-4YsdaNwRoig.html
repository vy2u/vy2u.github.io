you know where she's like hey guys
welcome back to my channel so for
today's tutorial we're going to be doing
this look right here obviously this is
the look that I wore in my haul video
and you guys all requested a love this
look because it's dramatic but then it's
also really soft also I had a subscriber
in the comments of my haul video asked
how to blend false lashes with your lash
line if you're not wearing eyeliner and
I definitely show you guys how to do
that in this video so if that's
something you've been wanting to learn I
kind of go in depth with that here so
yeah that's about it if you guys are
interested then keep on watching so the
first thing I'm going to do is use my
Too Faced hangover primer just prime
your face oops this primer is nice
because it smells like a pina colada
the only reason I like it because it
smells nice I'm going to go ahead and
apply my foundation this is my Armani
luminous silk foundation this is in the
shade 7.5 which is my tanner shade I'm a
little pale today cuz my fake tan wore
off but I'm going to tan myself up with
the foundation anyway taking a few pumps
of that onto my zoeva silk finish brush
and I'm just going to buff that in so as
you guys can see this is a little bit
tanner but it'll blend I'll make it
blend
well I'm looking tan again so next I'm
going to use my concealer this is the
Naked skin concealer by Urban Decay and
the shade medium light or eye shadow
look is going to be pretty light today
so if I was using Dark Shadows I
definitely would do this step lost after
the eye makeup and then I'm just going
to go ahead and buff this brush is
really dirty don't judge me I'm going to
go ahead and use my Real Techniques
brush to buff that into the under eye
area I like to use just patting motions
because this is a delicate area to set
the under eyes I'm going to use my Kat
Von D shade light palette and I'm going
to use the banana shade in the center
here with my ELF blush brush
all right so I've been loving this brush
to contour and bronze and do all that
stuff with it's the Mac 168 brush it's a
little bit dirty don't judge me so I
didn't even tell you guys what I'm using
so I'm actually going to use my Mac
Studio Fix foundation in NC 43 and I'm
going to swirl this brush in there and
I'm going to use this to kind of warm up
my why am I talking like this
you also want to take that around your
hairline next to highlight I'm going to
use my you a highlighter I'm going to
pop this in using my fingers and then
right on top of that I'm going to use my
makeup forever Pro sculpting duo to
highlight even more and this is what I
wore in the haul video so I'm going to
apply that now and I'm just going to use
the gold part of it when you put a
powder on top of cream it just makes it
even more intense also going to place a
little bit of that highlighter and the
tip of my nose it looks cute and on my
Cupid's bow for blush a lot of you guys
asked what blush I was wearing in the
video and it was this one by hot makeup
I love this color it's called treasure
let me open it for you guys it's bright
orange I love orange peachy blushes
you
okay so for the eyes I'm just gonna go
ahead and base them first this is based
them sounds like I'm cooking a turkey or
something I'm just gonna apply my
eyeshadow base this is Mac soft ochre so
now to set the base I'm just going to go
ahead and take a shadow close to the
base color I'm just going into the Too
Faced natural matte palette and taking
day adding a powder on top of the cream
is just going to make it a lot easier
for you to blend any other powders on
top so for the lid color I'm actually
going to go into the Tarte lip palette
I'm going to mix force of nature with
free spirit and apply that to my lid so
to map out the shape of this kind of
softer cut crease look I'm going to use
this caramel shade bio Nastasia Beverly
Hills it's called caramel I'm going to
apply this using my morphe m4 for one
brush what you want to do with the brush
is hold it at an angle and then I'm just
going to look down into my mirror and
I'm going to map out the shape of this
cut crease type thing that we have going
I like to start in the middle of the
socket so that I could kind of know okay
this is my starting point and then I
like to take it all the way in for this
look that I did I took it all the way in
to the inner socket here just really go
free with it over here don't worry about
having eyeshadow in this area I know
it's scary and different but it's okay
just do it
and then I'm going to pick up a little
bit more product and for this look I
actually just kind of took it down
follow the bone and then when you get to
like this part of the eye where it
starts to like winged out then you just
kind of turn your brush I hope I'm
explaining this okay you're going to
like kind of turn your brush a little
bit and think
flick out
so it's like a little curve here soon
I'm saying so it's like a start here go
in and then curve out this just kind of
gave us our rough shape and it's also
going to work as our transition shade so
that everything looks nice and blended
so I'm going to pick up more products
and just further define that shape
bring it into this corner here bringing
it this far is a little bit more
editorial but if you do it soft enough
you can still wear it okay and I'm also
going to take the same eyeshadow with a
sigma firm shader brush and I'm going to
run that on the lower lash line but now
for the star which is like my favorite
part of this eye shadow look and it's
the NARS Galapagos eyeshadow that I
mentioned in my favorites or my haul
video so with this galapagos eyeshadow
i'm going to focus it mostly in this
area and on this outer area and then
blend out whatever else is leftover on
the brush through the crease so I always
use this as my starting point and make
sure you use the same motions as we did
with the other eyeshadow so starting
point here and then once we get to this
curve of the eye kind of hug the socket
so we're going to hug the sock is what
I'm calling it
then I'm going to take a little bit more
on the brush and go into this inner part
of the I know
so I'm connecting these two lines with
whatever's left over on this on the
brush however I'm not putting most of
the product there I'm focusing the
product on the inner and outer after we
have deepened up the crease I like to go
back into the shadows that we used on
the lid with a flat brush and I like to
just take this time to really pack it on
the lid just in case I you know blended
some of the pigment away and you know
I'll just sharpen up this crease area
too if you kind of got any eyeshadow
into the lid you can kind of sharpen
this up here I'm also going to take the
eyeshadow and run this right along the
curve of the crease and that's really
going to sharpen up the crease look
if you want to deepen up the crease even
more you can take an angled brush with
the Glock Galapagos eyeshadow and you
can just kind of run that right along
the bottom of where you blended
everything out this is if you want to
get real technical with it and really
sharpen it up you guys can totally skip
this step
I'm going really lightly with this -
very very lightly
and then with the same angled brush and
if you guys are curious what angled
brush this is because I did use it in
another video this is an angled brush
from the Mac Daddy collection at the
angel Marino collection if you guys
follow Mac Daddy he made some brushes
with morphe and this is just one of them
I love this little angled brush because
it's nice and tiny anyways I'm also
going to take this brush and pick up
some of the galapagos eyeshadow and run
it on the lower lash line and I'm
dotting this on because I don't want it
to get any fallout so just lightly
patting it I'm mainly focusing this on
the outer part of the eye and then I'm
just going to take the brush that we
used in the crease which is this little
petite crease brush with more of the
caramel shade and I'm going to blend
this out just buff it out a little bit
so it's not harsh so in the makeup look
that I had for the haul video I actually
used the NARS pencil in my waterline but
I can't find it right now so I'm going
to use my NYX wonder pencil instead it's
the same kind of nudie pencil so I'm
going to use this in the waterline
you guys can see adding the nude and the
waterline just really made the dark part
in the lower lashline really pop anyways
now I'm gonna add mascara this is my
little crusty
really crusty Tarte lights camera lashes
mascara it's the travel size 1 I just
feel like it works better I don't know
why and I'm going to apply that to my
top and bottom lashes I'm not going to
put too much mascara on the top lashes
because we're gonna apply falsies but I
just want to give them a quick coat I'm
going to use the demi wispies by Ardell
and I'm actually going to show you guys
because somebody asked in my comments
how you can get your lashes to not show
the band when you don't wear eyeliner
because I know that's a little bit
tricky so first of all you need tweezers
our del lashes are the easiest to hide
the band because it's so thin so if
you're not used to wearing eyelashes I
recommend these and you're going to get
your tweezers and put your glue on there
and make sure it's nice and tacky if you
try to put your lashes on when it's
still wet they're going to slide around
and it's gonna be a nightmare it's going
to mess up your eyeshadow like don't do
it just wait for it to dry a little bit
then what you're going to do is hold
your mirror below you and you're going
to want to look down don't close your
eyes or don't like try to close it just
kind of look down you're going to bring
the lash from up top instead of coming
at it like this come at it like this I'm
saying come down like this and just pop
it on coming from the top helps hide the
band because it kind of pushes it in a
different direction and then what you
want to do is get it as close to your
lash line as possible like really close
almost on the lashes close but
and I like to kind of push it up and
under like I grab the tweezers
and I push the lashes straight in and
then a little bit up okay so after you
get them on take your you can take your
I use my nails because I have like nails
that I could pinch but I'm gonna just
like pinch my lid but very carefully
not too much just around like right
where the skin meets the lash I'm just
gonna push down on the skin slightly
while the glue is tacky and that's gonna
kind of go over the lash band like it's
gonna see how now you can't really see
it that's because I'm pinching skin
right on top of them my even explaining
this right inch the lid to the lash if
that makes any sense this is really easy
to do with our dull lashes and not so
easy to do with ikonics by house of
lashes and then push up afterwards so
that your lashes come nice and flirty
you don't want them to be pointing down
this is like a whole video on how to
apply lashes now gone too far
eyes are done unless you forgot a step
and you want to highlight you're in a
corner I'm going to use my NARS duo and
this is in craving and I'm just going to
take the light part and apply that to
the inner corners of my eyes what a
difference what a difference in inner
corner highlight makes this is with a
highlight and this sides not I look sad
now so when I filmed my haul I'd
actually filmed my lookbook video so I
had had my makeup on the whole day and I
was alternating between kinda sexy and
yash by Mac but I'm pretty sure I had
mostly kind of sexy and then maybe some
of Yash mixed in so let's just go ahead
and mix these two together so first I'm
going to go in with Yash it's just like
a nude color here it's really nude kind
of sexy is a little bit more Mavi pink
alright guys and this is the finished
makeup look alright guys so that is it
