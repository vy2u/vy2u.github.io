desi makeup on Instagram and some of you
have asked me to create a YouTube
channel so finally I stopped making
excuses for not creating one and did so
thank you guys for pushing me to start
this channel I hope that this video is
helpful for some of you all of the
eyeshadows that I have used are from
this palette and this is the motives
cosmetics palette so the look I created
tonight is a very soft romantic look it
is very very simple to execute the only
difficulty in this look I would say
would be the cat eyeliner and I know a
lot of people have difficulty executing
this but with practice I promise you
guys you will all be able to do it I had
one this was terrible at it and now it's
second nature to me but besides that
everything else is very easy I used a
lot a lot of warm tones if you like what
you see then keep on watching bye guys
starting off by using Tarte smooth
operator tinted moisturizer and I'm
applying that all over my face as a base
in place a foundation I find it has
great coverage and it feels amazing on
my skin now I'm going in with Auto
stassi's brow palette and I'm going to
use dark brown with them out to six-six
brush and I'm just going to fill in any
sparse areas of my brows and I actually
started filming this after I did it off
camera but I'll make another video on
eyebrows but I'm just showing you guys
here the motion make sure you always
stroke the brush in the same direction
of hair growth
this way it looks more natural I'm using
Mac painterly paint-pot hair to apply as
an eyeshadow base and this prevents our
eyeshadows
Oh going in with motives and the color
blizzard and I'm packing that all over
my brow bone as a highlight I love to
pack colors highlight colors on and then
blend them downwards I find that when I
do my crease color it actually blends a
lot easier when I do this it's also nice
to clean up a little bit of what you did
on your brows with your highlight I'm
going in with motives eye shadow in red
earth and slowly building this color
into the outer part of my crease with a
Mac 217 brush this is my favorite
blending brush it dense enough to where
you can get into the crease but still
blend really nicely
you
this is the MEC two to four and this
brush is amazing I love it it's fluffier
then beat to 17 so you get to really
really blend all the edges whereas the
217 is a little bit more dense and it
gets into the crease better if you want
to know the difference between the two
I'm going to continue this step until I
feel that I'm happy with the shape and
blending blending can be a little bit
tedious but it's definitely worth it in
the end
because there's nothing worse than harsh
edges
now I'm going in with vino and Shoko
light in these are both motives and I'm
packing that on the outer portion of my
eye and extending it out just a bit with
a deli M tools brush in 772 and then I'm
going to go back in with my blending
brush and blend out those edges
now I'm going in with a flat shader
brush and the color vanilla or motives
cosmetics and I'm just packing this onto
the inner portions of my lid and then
blending out with the fluffy brush those
edges so that everything smoothly
transitions now I'm using L'Oreal's gel
liner in black and I'm using a sigma
eyeliner brush and this isn't eo5 and
I'm just using this to get really close
to the lash line I'm using a Mac 266
angled brush here to get the wing and I
feel like this brush really does the job
for you
it just has the perfect shape and it
gives you a sharp edge this is the Tarte
creaseless concealer which is my
favorite I love this I'm just packing
this on under my eyes and blending it
out with my finger I usually use a
blending sponge for this but I couldn't
find it at the time so I'm using my
finger but it works out
I also put this on the very outer parts
of my eye to really clean up and sharpen
that wing and any eyeshadow that we have
drifted towards example you want to make
sure you really press your concealer
into your skin so that it has a less
chance of creasing and it warms it up
making it a little bit more flawless now
I'm going in with Maybelline's dark
circle eraser and I'm using this to
highlight this have a liquid to powder
finish so that's why I love it under the
eyes because it doesn't really crease at
all and it also is for dark circles so
it brightens up your face this brush I
got at Walmart a long time ago and it's
one of my favorite brushes and I don't
know what it's called but it's amazingly
soft and I need to find it it's perfect
for the under eyes I'm just blending
away all that stuff I just thought
now I'm going in with Maryland beauty
powder and I know that this is a limited
edition so a lot of people can't get it
but it's basically highlighting under
the eye I will definitely let you guys
know if I find to do for this this is
also setting my concealer that I just
put on I'm highlighting any areas that I
want with this powder as well and just
blend it now I'm using L'Oreal's
smoldering pencil in black and I'm just
going to run that under my water on my
waterline it can be messy because we're
gonna blend it out anyway
I am going in with Adele Adele iam tools
brush 755 and you know again and I'm
just blending that out
we want it to be smoldering not you
don't want a harsh line under your eye
I'm taking red earth again and I'm
putting that in inner corners of my eyes
this is my very loved and NYX matte
bronzer in deep tan this is my favorite
bronzer and I'm applying this with a
sigma brush and I believe the name of
this brush has change and I don't know
what the new name is but it's just a
small tapered brush and I'm just going
into the hollows of my cheeks with this
then I'm taking it up to the temples and
around my forehead just drawn up as well
this is Rimmel stay matte in sandstorm
and I love this powder just to set
everything I also like to use this to
blend out the bronzer now I'm going in
with mineralized skinfinish in soft and
gentle with a Mac one eight eight duo
fiber brush just putting this above the
apples of my cheeks I'm going to take a
fluffy blending brush and also apply
that down the bridge of my nose and on
my Cupid's bow I'm going to go in with
motives
pretty in pink and apply that to the
apples of my cheeks using the same Sigma
brush that I was using for my bronzer
now I'm just taking this blush and
sweeping it up towards my temple also
blending that into the bones are
I applied my lashes on off-camera just
because it was very difficult to get the
right angle but they are for lower
lashes and I will put the name of them
in the description bar this is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial I'll see you again soon if
