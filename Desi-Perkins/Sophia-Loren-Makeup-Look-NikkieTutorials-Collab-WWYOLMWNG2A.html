collab with the beautiful
nikkietutorials we decided to film
iconic makeup looks I did Sophia Loren
and on her channel she did peggy moffitt
so don't forget to go to her channel to
check it out and subscribe because she's
so fun silly and just an amazing artist
I love her and you guys will definitely
love her makeup looks with that said
let's get started with Sophia Loren
prior to filming I already filled in my
eyebrows however I'm going to use the
Anastasia brow gel to kind of make all
those brow hairs go straight up because
that's the shape that Sophia Loren
always had going on
picking up Mac soft ochre Paint Pot I'm
going to apply that as my base and I'm
also going to carve out my brows with
this then I'm going to go in with the
lorac Pro palette and take that white
eyeshadow and pop that onto my brow bone
she had a really high brow bone so this
is going to make it look really nice and
high up there then I'm going to take
sable on a Mac 2 to 4 and of course you
guys always know adding a transition
shade is key this is kind of just like a
wash of color cuz her eyeshadow is
pretty simple so I'm just putting that
into the crease then I'm going to take
slate which is a silvery color from the
same palette I'm going to pack that on
to the lid and I'm kind of gonna map out
the shape of where the eyeliner is going
to go and give myself that cat eye that
she always had going on make sure you
leave at the outside of your eye free of
shadow because that's where the white
eyeliner is going to go later
after you've applied at that shadow then
go in one last time with the sable color
and just buff it out next I'm taking my
NYC liquid liner and this sign is pretty
amazing if you guys haven't tried it you
should anyways I'm going to use this and
make sure you bring the eyeliner all the
way to the inner corner and I'm using
the eye shadow to map out where my flick
is gonna go and she always had really
thick extreme eyeliner which is why I
chose her because I love liner and so
I'm just building that wing up next I'm
taking makeup geeks Immortal gel liner
on a del iam tools' liner brush and I'm
just going to apply this on the lower
lash line but don't hit the waterline
with this because we're going to bring
this up to make it look like we have an
exaggerated elongated cat eye
we're going to fill in that empty space
with white liner you guys can use any
white liner I'm using the Inglot gel
liner for this I'm just going to apply
that under the black liner that we
placed above and also in the waterline
and here I'm just going up and darkening
the black liner a bit and just cleaning
it up now it's time for lashes which is
really going to bring this look together
I'm applying my House of lashes iconic
big surprise and then my bottom lashes
are precious and while those lashes dry
I'm going to go ahead and apply my
foundation so I'm using hello flawless
foundation with a Zoe of a foundation
brush I'm just going to buff that in to
the skin
next I'm taking my motives foundation
quad and medium and applying that to the
under eye just to get rid of any dark
circles and it's also going to brighten
up just a bit to give myself those super
high cheekbones that Sophia had I'm just
going to apply my Mac a highlighter and
light boost and then I'm going to blend
it out with a damp Beauty Blender I'm
going to use this Mac Studio Fix and NC
43 as my sort of transition shade but
for my contour it's a little bit darker
than my skin tone so I'm going to use
this to kind of warm up my skin before I
go in with a heavy duty contour I'm
buffing this in with a Tarte brush that
I got from a holiday kit then I'm going
to use the banana powder from the
anastacio contour kit and just kind of
set all of that under eye area that we
did earlier alright so for the heavy
duty contour I'm going to use the city
color contour kit and this is super
EXTREME and I love it for that very
reason but I'm going to give myself a
super round kind of contour just to
accentuate the roundness of my
cheekbones just like hers then I'm going
to take my mary-lou manizer and apply
that to the high points also just to
make my cheekbones look a little bit
higher do you guys see the pattern here
now I'm going to take Mac blush in
peaches and I'm going to place this on
the back of my cheeks not on the apples
so much because I want to keep that
really sharp elongated look I'm going to
pick up strip-down
lipliner and pretty much over line the
crap out of my lips because she has on
big old lips then I'm going to take myth
and apply that first because it's a
light color so it's going to make the
lips appear larger and then I'm going to
mix that with kind of sexy also by Mac
now I'm picking up honest tossing a dip
brow in dark brown and I'm gonna kind of
put a fake mole over here because I
noticed that she does that sometimes and
if you apply a little bit of powder over
it it makes it look more natural
to make it look like I had dark hair
just like Sofia I just clipped in these
at Bellamy clip-on bangs and then I tied
a piece of fabric as a scarf around my
head to make it look just like the photo
that I love of Sophia Loren and that
completes the look I hope you guys
enjoyed this video also don't forget to
check Nikki out on her channel to see
her tutorial and I'll see you guys in my
next video or I'll see some of you at
beautycon this Saturday bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
