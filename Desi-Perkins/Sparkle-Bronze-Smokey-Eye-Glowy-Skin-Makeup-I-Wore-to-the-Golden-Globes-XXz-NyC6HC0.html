for today's video I'm going to be
recreating the look that I wore for the
Golden Globes you guys don't follow me
on Instagram then maybe you didn't know
that crispy and I went to the Golden
Globes and a lot of you guys were
curious as to how we got invited to the
Golden Globes cuz clearly we're not
actresses
so basically crispy got invited just to
do some social media stuff and she took
me as her plus-one which was really
exciting I was her boy for the night it
was like a Cinderella story because we
had gotten dressed by Michael Costello
who's an amazing designer
we both had these beautiful gowns I just
loved my dress I felt like I don't know
like a princess
good Disney Princess when we were there
it was amazing seeing so many
celebrities that you just see in
magazines and TV and every time a
celebrity would walk by with like
squeeze krispies hand like but I try to
keep my cool you know it was just like
fangirling inside and we went to some of
the after parties which were a lot of
fun krispies and I ended up at Denny's
eating chicken wings and our gowns at
the end of the night which was also
really fun so for my makeup I wanted to
do something a little bit softer more
neutral of course the eyelashes add the
drama to the look I knew I wanted to
keep everything really neutral I wanted
the skin to be not super contoured but
just very soft and glowy you guys can
see the glow is real right now so if you
guys are interested to see how I created
this look for the Golden Globes then
keep on watching I've already applied my
primer and this is the Tarte clean slate
timeless smoothing primer I'm going to
go in straight to my eyeshadow base
which is Mac soft ochre I've recently
tried it's not Latisse but it's similar
to lychees I only used it once the other
night and like my eyes are completely
red from it so the dreams that I had of
having possible long eyelashes are dead
so every time I apply an eyeshadow base
I like to make sure to set that with a
powder or a shadow that is close to your
natural skin color or close to the color
of the eyeshadow base this is from
Anastacio Beverly Hills it's called
orange no no
yeah it's called orange soda and I'm
going to use my favorite blending brush
which is the morphe m4 41 and I'm going
to swirl that in there and generously
apply this to the crease so this color
you don't have to be super perfect with
you just start kind of building it up oh
and then you want to keep it really
round sometimes I would bring it out if
I want to wing but no we're going to
keep this round basically I've just
built up orange soda in the upper crease
and into the crease okay so now I'm
going to go into this color here it's a
nice brown but it has a really warm red
undertone this is by honest Aussie at
Beverly Hills and it's called red earth
and I'm just using the same brush you
guys can see I just placed it right on
that little tapered part of the brush
because we're going to focus this more
into the crease so I first like to
lightly kind of map out the round shape
of the eye once you kind of mapped out
the shape then you can pick up more
product and just continuously build on
it I'm going to start on this outer
corner here and then just kind of pull
it
so now I'm going to go into the tartlet
palette and I'm going to take this dark
brown shade that's called multitasker
it's just a dark brown shade you guys
can use any color that you have so I'm
going to focus this dark brown shade
just in the socket line and it's
definitely okay if it gets onto the lids
because we're going to cover that with
an eyeshadow anyways so really focus
that into the socket line
now it's time for the lid shade and this
is the best part of this whole look
because this is a beautiful eyeshadow
it's from colour-pop and it's this one
right here it's called on the rocks it's
just like the most beautiful bronze
eyeshadow but it has little flecks of
gold sparkles and it looks gorgeous but
it's kind of creamy so I'd use a
synthetic brush we're just going to pack
this all over the lid I also like to
take the time to clean up the crease
with this eye shadow color so see how
it's not like perfect right here I'll
just like kind of clean it up and give
that crease a really nice round crisp
line okay so this I shadow is just so
beautiful like I don't even know if it
picks up all the way on camera but it
just has this really nice shine to it
that almost makes your eyelid look
slightly wet like that really glisteny
look you guys know I like to do my face
makeup before I do anything on the lower
lash line so I'm going to zoom you out
just a little bit and do my foundation
I'm gonna buff the Mac Studio Fix fluid
all over my skin just a light layer not
too heavy and I'm gonna buff that in
using my zoeva 107 powder brush
I like to do my eyebrows before my
foundation because if you get any
foundation under your eyebrows the
product that you put on top of your
eyebrows tends to slide around
I found that where I had sparse areas
through the night the eyebrow product
would like fade away so they'd be all
patchy remember one time like half my
eyebrow was missing it's very you just
have to go home because you can't be out
with just half an eyebrow of course next
we're gonna do our concealer man I've
been on this journey to find a new
concealer I'm still using the last of my
NARS it's literally just I'm just
scraping at the edges of it though with
the concealer especially for special
events I like to really really Who am I
kidding special events no special events
I always highlight like this and I'm
just using this Kat Von D dual ended
brush before moving on to any other part
of the face you want to set the
under-eye concealer right away so does
increase and I'm using banana bio
Nastasia Beverly Hills I'm just setting
that under-eye with this and I'm using a
zoeva one for for brush for this
finishing off the eyes I'm going to take
this liner this is the urban decay
there's barely any left it's so little
the demolition liner it's just a really
nice creamy Brown I'm just going to
apply that first I always have the
hardest time applying lower eyeliner on
camera I don't know why take a pencil
brush and just kind of blend that out a
little bit I'm using a zoeva pencil
brush so now after we've blended out
that liner it's it doesn't really
connect to the crease you want to kind
of make sure it all flows together so
what we need to do is take a warm
colored shadow and blend into those
edges there I'm going to use Sienna also
by Anastasia Beverly Hills a dupe for
this or a similar color would be Brown
script by Mac if you guys have that eye
shadow as well I know that's a really
popular color and I'm just going to take
a two three four so eva brush and run
this along the edge of
outliner
so take a blending brush and kind of
diffuse that to make sure that you don't
have like any harsh edges around here so
now you guys can really see the
difference here between running an
eyeshadow under your eyeliner and really
smoking it out versus just leaving the
eyeliner smoked out this kind of
connects the whole look together whereas
this seems a little bit disconnected
taking on the rocks again I'm going to
take the same brush this is just a
little makeup geek concealer brush
and I'm gonna run that on the lower lash
line just to kind of get the glittery
effect also on this area here so I'm
going to start in the inner corner and
just kind of DAB it along so it's nice
and glittery really big part about this
look was the lashes because I didn't do
any really dark eyeliner or a wing I'm
going to be using my Tarte lights camera
lashes mascara big surprise I'm plying
my favorite eye lashes which are the
ikonics my house of lashes they just are
so pretty like I try to use other lashes
and just I'm sorry and Plus this is what
I wore okay you guys wanted a recreation
of the look I wore on the Golden Globes
so this is what I wore so here we go
plop this on just giving them a slight
push upwards and now of course I'm going
to use these bottom eyelashes these are
precious also have sub lashes they are
my favorite bottom eyelashes they're
just like the perfect size I'm taking
the tweezers I'm going to grab the
lashes and you're just going to pop them
right underneath your natural lashes
as my eyelashes are drying I'm going to
go ahead and finish off the face
you guys know my love Matt give me Sun
to warm up the skin so I'm going to use
Mac's give me Sun to warm up my skin and
I'm using that cap on Dee dual ended
brush I think this is the new brush this
is a new brush that comes with their uh
I think she released this with her new
contour kit and then to really give us
that nice bronzy glow I'm going to go in
with a city color bronzer and this is in
Sunset and when you apply something like
this you don't want to use too small of
a brush like we used for the matte
bronzer you want to use something a
little bit fluffier and less dense
because you don't want too much of this
product on your face because it is
shimmery so I like to take take it on a
brush this is this is actually a luxe
eat 502 large powder brush and then you
just kind of want to run it over your
face so to get that really dewy luminous
look I'm going to use a cream
highlighter this one's buys you a and
it's called tier and to apply this I'm
just going to use my fingers I'm just
going to lightly Pat this on the high
points of my face
right where the highest point of your
cheekbones are so it catches the light
really nicely and this highlights really
nice because it's not super strong it's
just really really nice and sheer but in
a really nice good way I need to get
more adjectives in my vocabulary I'm
also going to apply a little bit of this
on the tip of my nose and slightly on my
Cupid's bow and to keep with that really
nice dewy skin look I'm going to use
another cream product this is also by
Joey and it's in the shade amaryllis
just this really really it looks really
hot pink but once you put it on it's a
little more sheer so I'm also going to
be using my fingers for this and I'm
just going to start off by patting it on
the back of my hand to make sure I don't
have too much product
I'm just going to build on it with my
finger I almost forgot to highlight the
inner corner of my eyes when I
definitely had a highlight I actually
just have been using my mary-lou manizer
by the balm and I'll just pack that on
to the inner corner just brightens up
your look
so for the lips I used my favorite nude
lip liner which is the LA girl endless
lip liner and this is in the shade
natural follow the natural shape of my
lips my lips are so chapped right now I
wore on a Stassi at Beverly Hills
new liquid lipstick in the shade Pierre
Hollywood it's just such a beautiful
nude with slightly a pink undertone and
it's going to pop that on since the
whole look is kind of dewy and glowy I
definitely didn't want to stick with
just matte lips so I'm going to add a
lip gloss this one is in the shade when
it's similar to the color on the lips
and this is buys you a they make
beautiful lip glosses and I'm just going
to pop that on right on top this lip
gloss is also long-lasting so good for
events everything should be long-lasting
at this point last but not least you
want to make sure to set your makeup so
I'm going to be using the Urban Decay
all nighter setting spray and just
lightly mess that all over my face
