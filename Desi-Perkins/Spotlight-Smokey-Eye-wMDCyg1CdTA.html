let's get started on today's makeup look
I'm going to be using this mineral
palette by pixie and I'm picking up this
champagne shade and just applying that
to my brow bone next I'm going to get
this really pretty copper shade and
apply that to the crease with a giant
fluffy brush this shade is going to
serve as our transition sheet so it's
going to make all our other eye shadows
a lot easier to blend picking up this
very light solo shadow in the color
bronze theme I'm going to pack this
color onto the outer V of my eye this
shadow has a reflective property so it's
going to look nice and shimmery and I'm
also going to take that shade and pack
it into the inner corner of my eye
creating what I like to call a sandwich
on the eye so leave the center
completely free of that shadow I'm going
to go ahead and dampen my brush and I'm
going to pop it into this shade here and
I'm going to apply that to the center of
the lid it's going to give your eye just
a really pretty highlight
once you've got that all packed on you
want to make sure just to blend away any
edges you guys are going to see I do a
lot of blending in this video so to
deepen the colors even more I'm gonna
pack on this deep chocolate brown shade
to the outer and inner corners and of
course I'm just repeating the same
process we did before packing on the
color and then diffusing that color out
so once I'm all done with that I'm gonna
take a clean giant fluffy brush and give
it one last blend around the edges now
picking up at this liner and this is in
the color bronze beam and I'm gonna
apply this to the outer lower lash line
and the inner part of my eye I'm
basically mimicking the same thing we
did at the top just on the bottom
picking up this endless silky eye pen in
the color oyster glow I'm going to pop
that in at the center of the lower lash
line and also in the tear duct and this
eyeliner is really good because it's
long-lasting so it's not going to fade
out on you and I'm just going to take a
clean brush and kind of blend all of
those liners out so it's not so harsh
before I apply any eye shadow to the
lower lash line I'm going to apply my
concealer just so it doesn't interfere
with the smokiness of the shadow I'm
going to go into this bronze color and
I'm going to apply that to the outer
portions and the inner portions of our
eye and it's just going to make our eyes
sparkle really nicely I really like this
color once again I'm just going to blend
everything out and I picked up a little
bit more of that copper shade that we
used in the crease earlier I'm also
going back into that champagne shade and
popping it on to the inner corner just
to brighten it just a bit
and I actually decided just to add a
tiny touch of that liner once more into
the tear duct so after we pop on a few
coats of mascara and our favorite lashes
we can move on to the face to prep my
lips so they're nice and smooth I'm
going to apply this succulent lip twin
we also want to make sure to prep our
face so I'm going to apply this flawless
and poreless primer all over the skin
just so I have a nice even application
for my foundation so go ahead and apply
your favorite foundation and then I
actually forgot to set my concealer
earlier so I'm just going to go ahead
and do that now next I'm going to warm
up the skin by applying this bronzer in
the color summertime I'm just going to
apply this to the cheekbones and also to
the hairline I'm going to go ahead and
pick up this Beauty blush in the color
perkiest pink and it's just going to
give a really nice sheer color to my
cheeks lastly I'm gonna pick up a nude
lipstick with some pink undertones and
apply that to my lips and that is the
last step
