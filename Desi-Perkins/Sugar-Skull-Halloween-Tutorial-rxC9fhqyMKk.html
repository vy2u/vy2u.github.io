your face and this is NYX shine killer
this is so that all the face paint and
stuff just stays on all night now I'm
just taking my fingers and kind of
feeling the natural curves of the bones
along my socket and I'm going to take a
white liner pencil and just follow those
curves this will give it a more
realistic effect and also don't worry
too much about getting them completely
symmetrical because in reality they
aren't so it's okay if they're a little
off now I made a mixture of Mac Studio
fluid and nc15 which is way lighter than
my skin tone and the white from the
makeup from our flash palette and I mix
that together and I'm applying it on my
face with a damp Beauty sponge and the
reason I'm doing this is because I feel
like foundation will stick to the skin
better and also because I don't want to
be completely stark white make sure you
really work it into your skin and here
I'm just setting everything with makeup
Forever's loose powder take a black
liner and really define the eye sockets
and this will just make it easier for
when we fill in with black paint
I prefer a liner that's more creamy
because then if you mess up you can
smudge it and you can blend it a lot
easier so I wouldn't recommend a
waterproof liner for this now I just
picked up max chroma line and black
black with a liner brush and I'm going
over that shape that we originally made
with the white liner on our nose the
reason I'm using max chroma line is
because it doesn't smudge as much and
the nose is an area that gets touched a
lot so you want to make sure you use
something that's not going to smudge all
over the place now I'm picking up a
paint brush with the makeup forever
flash palette black color and I'm
filling in the eye socket I'm
concentrating most of the color towards
the top and then just kind of fading it
down as I go I'm trying to create a
gradient effect with the eyes so you
don't want to put a lot of product as it
gets lighter
you
now I'm going to take a fluffy brush and
blend those edges out make sure you take
a black shadow and set all of that cream
makeup that you just applied take a dark
brown shade and just blend it towards
the edges so that it gives you more of
that gradient effect I'll just keep
blending a dark shadow until you feel
like it gives a soft gradient take a
huge fluffy brush and blend all of that
together here I'm just taking a black
shadow and kind of just making sure that
those edges are really defined line your
waterline with a black liner and blend
that out don't forget to set your nose
with black shadow as well and here I'm
just taking the makeup forever block and
a paint brush and I'm just creating
creases along the brows and if you
looked closely I actually creased my
brows so I could get a more accurate
line take the dark brown shadow and
really blend along those edges to create
more depth
and then use a fluffy brush to blend
that out and here I'm using black now
too just to go along the actual line and
this creates more depth and kind of
build it up until you're happy with it
but you want to make sure it looks like
you're actually browning
going back in with the white liner again
and mapping out the rest of the hollows
on my face I just think it's so much
easier to use a white liner because if
you mess up you can easily just smudge
it and it's not a problem now go in with
the black paint and fill in all of those
hollows that you just created and I'm
just using a regular paint brush here I
actually picked up the chroma line to do
this because it is along the hairline
and if you are going to be out somewhere
where it's hot you don't want to sweat
off your makeup so I actually use that
instead on this area and now I'm just
pretty much blending it out all along
the edges
and this is going to look messy for a
bit but once you clean everything up and
really blend it out it's going to come
together here I realized that I didn't
really make the sides even this is a
little bit more square and this is more
round so I'm just taking a q-tip with
makeup remover to fix my mistake
now take black shadow and really darken
up your jawline and make sure you keep
blending this with a beauty sponge it'll
just make it look or airbrushed take a
brown shadow and Grady that towards the
jawline also take that brown shadow
through the inner corners of your brows
and all along your hairline and
basically use it as if you're contouring
normally because skulls aren't stark
white they actually have a lot of depth
so we want to create that depth with
this brown shadow and just make it look
a little bit more natural and real now
the reason I didn't use stark white in
the beginning was because I wanted to
later use just white to highlight all of
the areas that actually come forward in
a skull so here I'm just using the white
from the makeup forever flash palette
and really making those parts of my face
pop
you
you
blend that out with a fluffy brush to
make sure you don't have any harsh edges
and just keep adding white and all the
areas that you want to come forward
now I'm taking the turquoise color from
the makeup forever flash palette on the
PD sponge and I'm just pressing that
into the lips and all around the lip
area now if you do not have this palette
it's totally fine you could use a shadow
for this and you can use any shadow that
you want I'm using this because my lips
are super chopped at the moment and I
felt like powder might make them look
even worse now I'm taking the black from
the palette and a art brush and I'm just
creating the teeth
there's no right or wrong way to do this
just create lines going up and down and
it's gonna look good regardless of what
you do here just try to kind of make
them all the same thickness but they
don't have to be perfect
I'm kind of thickening up the lines in
the middle of my mouth because I want to
bring more attention and depth to the
center
I'm blending out those edges to create
once again more debt
I feel like if you're going to do a
skull you have to do a lot of shading to
make it look better and it makes the
biggest difference so it'll be worth it
I'm going back in with that turquoise
color and just cleaning up the edges and
adding a little bit more pop to the
teeth and then just blending all of
those edges out upwards and downwards
pop on some lashes these are House of
lashes noir fairy now I'm taking that
turquoise color again and I'm blending
it into the part that we made greedy
earlier I'm not taking a lot I just want
a subtle shade and here I'm taking the
white and just highlighting that center
portion
here I'm placing some rhinestones that I
bought from Michael's craft store and
pearls these were really inexpensive I
got a huge box of rhinestones for $3 all
different sizes and the pearls were
really inexpensive as well - I think
they're around $3 but I'm sticking them
on with tweezers and eyelash glue these
are representing the petals around my
eyes I just feel like it's a lot easier
to use rhinestones instead of drawing
all the petals here I'm also taking a
jewel from a craft store and I applied
eyelash glue let it get tacky and then
placed it on my forehead this step is of
course optional but I decided to throw
it in anyways I'm just taking the white
from the palette and using a craft brush
and creating the bones along my neck
then take the black with a smaller brush
and just draw a little squares going all
the way down
you
take a larger brush and the black paint
and just fill in all of that area and up
towards your jawline - this is the last
step - the look you can go back in and
make any final adjustments I'm going to
go ahead and put on a black wig and a
top hat that I glued flowers on from the
craft store and that's pretty much it so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'll
see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
