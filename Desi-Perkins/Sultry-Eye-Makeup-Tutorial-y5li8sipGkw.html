to apply this color by Mac it's called
Blanc type onto the brow bone and I'm
just going to pull it down towards the
crease after we've done that we're going
to apply a transition shade this is
Sienna by Anasazi Beverly Hills it's
from the lavish palette and I'm going to
just start sweeping this into my crease
and a little bit above my crease make
sure that you pull the shadow out
towards the tail of your brow
now I'm taking embark by Mac and this is
what we're going to use to really define
the crease after defining the crease
we're going to want to pull this
eyeshadow out towards the tail of the
brow bone and just diffuse those edges
so as you can see here I'm just pulling
that outwards
I'm pretty excited about this month's
glam bag because it has this city color
shadow and highlight lifts in it and
this is really nice because you can use
it for your eyes or your cheeks or any
highlighting that you want to do you can
use this product I'm going to use it on
the lids and I'm also going to take this
time to really sharpen the crease if any
eye shadow bond to the lid this is the
time to really make it look sharp and
I'm also going to extend this out
underneath that extended wing that we
made with the eye shadows
I'm going to take this Elizabeth ma
shadow and this is a crease free
eyeshadow which is really nice I'm going
to just pack that over the cream shadow
that we put on earlier and it's just
really gonna intensify everything and
just make everything look more fabulous
and of course I'm going to go in with my
trusty eyeliner buy a lot and I'm just
gonna first give myself a guide line and
then I'm going to pull that in towards
the inner corner of my eye and from here
you just want to slowly keep building on
that eyeliner until you have a wing that
you really like and you're happy with or
like my little brother always tells me
that my wing is so sharp I could kill a
man which I'd totally agree with him
smart kid that one
pick up an eyeliner I'm using my Urban
Decay's Elbit glide on and this is in
the color black velvet I'm just gonna
line my waterline with this and I really
like this one because it's easy to blend
out it's really black
I'm going back in with Siena by
anastasiya and I'm just kind of smoking
out that liner a bit to give us that
sultry come-hither fierceness then to
intensify that even more I'm going to
use Black Diamond from the same honest
hacia Beverly Hills palette and just
kind of pop that on the outer corners
put on some false lashes because that's
also very fierce
then I'm gonna do my concealer I'm using
my Anasazi Beverly Hills concealer in
2.0 and I'm just going to set that with
this Marilyn Beauty powder I'm gonna go
in with the contour kit and just kind of
mix these colors together and pop those
on my cheekbones
and I'm also going to contour my nose to
make it look nice and steamy using my
blush and stay pretty by Mac I'm just
going to pop that on the apples and
bring it up towards the temples now I'm
going to use this lipstick by Mac it's
called close contact and I'm going to
put that all over my dates and now what
to really top off this look you want to
add some a lip gloss and this is my Mary
Kay lip gloss and teddy bear and it has
a really really nice shine and I kind of
feel like it made my lips look a little
bit plumper I don't know what you guys
think so now I'm going to use my
highlight because I totally forgot about
it and we can never forget the highlight
and this is max whisper of guilt so that
is it for our sultry look I hope you
