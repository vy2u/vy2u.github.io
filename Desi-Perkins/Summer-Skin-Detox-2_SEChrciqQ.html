today I wanted to just kind of casually
sit down and do a video showing you guys
how I apply my sea salt products
it's called clara sea and it's like a
sea salt solutions kit i have been
getting a lot of blackheads lately
actually always i'm really prone to
getting blackheads in this area i know
it's like really common i don't get any
acne but i do tend to break out you know
once a month if you guys catch my drift
know what I'm saying
during this time my skin gets crazy acts
up and then I do get breakouts but
blackheads is definitely something I
struggle with all the time let's get
started I'm going to show you guys how I
use these products salt bar is basically
something that you could use on in your
body or your face this is better like
for the body for me as far as bar soaps
for my skin I actually like to use a
cleanser or something that will break up
my makeup because you know take it out
then I have these two things which are
the bomb Clara sea sea salt solutions
rapid detox charcoal exfoliant and the
reason I like this is because charcoal
actually dissolves your blackheads which
is exactly what I need and it also has
almond flour which brightens the skin so
that's basically what I look for is
something that's going to brighten
because I am darker complexion if I do
get breakouts it will scar if I try to
mess with them and I get Figment ation
so anything that is brightening I
usually tend to like gravitate toward
then the sea salt clarifies the skin as
well basically when I'm in the shower
I just have this little container you're
going to want to mix this with either
your just regular water or your face
wash so I'm just going to pour some of
this into this container
I'm going to mix it with some water I
think I added a little too much water
I'm going to take this piece and then
I'm just going to apply it you want to
make sure to be really gentle with this
I never exfoliate around my eyes make
sure to just stay away from this area
because it's really delicate skin
sometimes I like to bring this down to
my neck and decollete area as well but
since I'm not in the shower I don't want
to get too crazy over here you want to
make sure to do this for at least a
minute circular motions all around the
skin especially in your problem areas
which for me is my nose it's getting
everywhere so I just got back and
basically I just rinsed it off with warm
water now I can obviously tell that my
skin feels a lot softer a dermatologist
once told me that if you're using all
these expensive creams but you're not
exfoliating and you have all of this
buildup of dead skin that all of those
things aren't going to be able to
penetrate the surface so it's basically
like they're just sitting on top of your
skin and they're not actually being
absorbed so by exfoliating it's really
going to help you so now I'm going to
move on to a mask because my skin is
ready to absorb whatever I put on it now
I'm going to apply this deep or detox
mask
scoop out a small amount and mix it with
water until it creates a paste and then
we're going to apply that to our face
and let it sit for about five minutes so
once you've mixed it up and created a
paste with this you're going to just
apply it to your face
boom so it's so funny because anytime I
do do a face mask or a hair mask and I'm
not in the shower I'm just like doing
stuff around the house the mailman
always shows up at this time it never
filmed
I always have to answer the door looking
like crazy like this so usually I would
not have my eyebrows done but you guys
know the eyebrows struggle don't wonder
what that eyebrow off now alright so
after you have that all applied and you
look fabulous and you're ready for the
mailman to show up so you could open the
door looking crazy you just sit there
for about five to ten minutes it says
five minutes but usually I you know I
never I break all the rules you guys so
I'm going to leave it on for about ten
minutes because I'm a rebel
so I've let it sit for about ten minutes
now what I'm going to do is go ahead and
rinse everything off with warm water and
I'll be right back I just went ahead and
rinse everything off now you can go
ahead and put on your moisturizer or
anything else that you want and it's
really going to sink into the skin I do
that process once every two weeks and it
keeps my skin feeling a lot better
alright guys I hope you enjoyed this
video if you're interested in any of the
products that I used go ahead and check

will be links and everything you need to
know down there if you guys want to see
a full skincare video give it a thumbs

see that I recently ran out of two of my
products that I use all the time and I
have to go repurchase them so I didn't
want to make a video with everything and

this video and I'll see you next time
bye
that special time and every woman's life
where you know it's just butterflies and
white linen and you're running and white
