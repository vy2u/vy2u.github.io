today's video is going to be ten beauty
products that I cannot live without this
is actually inspired by Chloe Morello
stweet she put out a tweet that another
youtuber had made a video not related to
beauty but just ten things they couldn't
live without I kind of got the idea from
her so you guys haven't checked out
Chloe Morello she's a babe check her out
I will link her in the description box
down below let me tell you this is not
really an easy decision making process I
will say that I went through every
category and thought hmmm do I love this
product yes could I live without it yeah
if somebody gave me another product to
work with I could so really this is more
of like I need them in my life
all the time don't give me something
else to use thank you so much so the
first item I'm gonna count as one
because they go together this is my
shampoo and conditioner and it is the
way a shampoo and conditioner I love the
repair version and also the smoothing
version of these and let me tell you
guys I have somewhat of a frizzy texture
I have a frizzy texture not somewhat
there's a frizzy texture going on my
hair could either dry really frizzy and
separated or together if you have curly
hair you may understand that a little
bit more it's like your curls can be
frizzy or they could have like a nice
bouncy together texture and that's what
this does for me it also makes my hair
just really really soft it smells
phenomenal I remember one time I had
washed my hair with these and my mom
came to visit and she was walking by me
and she was like what is that I wasn't
wearing perfume okay and I had no idea
and then later I caught her low key
sniffing my hair she liked it that much
and I was like you're weird god I had to
give her a bottle even though I didn't
want to cuz I'm stingy like that this
stuff is just really really good I feel
like it works for every hair type my
hair is so soft feels like baby hair
super silky and I just don't want to use
any other shampoo and conditioner I
don't well the next thing I'm gonna talk
about is skincare and I feel like
skincare is a little tricky because I
love to try out new stuff all the time I
feel like if somebody were to give me
another moisturizer to work with right
now
another eye cream I'd be like yeah okay
there is one product that stands out
that really really changed my skin
dramatically and because of the category
it's in I kind of feel like I probably
won't switch this out or try a new one I
mean I'll try a new one but like don't
take this from me this is the LA
Henriksen toner I've been talking about
this forever I've already mentioned it
in favorites and in videos here before
this toner is just amazing incredible I
mean I'm sure you guys are sick of
hearing me talk about it but as far as
skincare goes this is the one thing that
I would want to keep using forever it
just always gets rid of any redness or
irritation in my skin any breakouts
I haven't had crazy breakouts recently
so I'm really happy about it I felt like
in general I didn't realize how much
makeup and gunk was left over on my skin
after makeup wipe and washing my face I
thought like yeah I'm good I'm clean but
then after using the toner with a silk
pad I realized that I still had makeup
left over I'd look at the pad and I
would see makeup there so if you don't
use a toner now I feel like that might
help keep your skin really really clean
especially at night before you go to bed
that way you're not sleeping with
leftover makeup because you might not
know that you are I had no idea for all
this time so I love this product ooh
so good so good since we're in skincare
let's move right on to Nivea another
product I've been using for quite some
time now
makeup Shayla is the one who introduced
me to this and nothing compares to Nivea
- you guys know that song this is the
essentially enriched it's very important
essentially enriched because they have a
few different ones but this one is the
best
I swear any time anybody asks me what
moisturizer what body glow this is just
an affordable but also the best way to
keep my skin hydrated get it at Target
it's like so easy to eat and accessible
and it's just never runs out I have them
always with me a lot of the products in
this video actually I always have a bag
of must-haves when I'm traveling going
on photo shoots anything that I'm doing
these are the
that always have to be with me no matter
what and this is like don't leave your
Nivea at home do not I don't care if
somebody else has lotion on the set it's
not always the same because this works
so well with flash if somebody takes a
flash photo of you it's like boom beam
what highlight are you wearing on your
shoulders
it's Nivea ok the best I can't live
without it I don't want to use another
lotion as far as foundation I'm sorry to
disappoint you but you see I wanted to
pick a foundation for you guys just to
have something in that category but to
be honest with you
I don't feel like there's a foundation I
can't live without right now I feel like
there's a few foundations that I love
and so I could always rotate those you
know what I mean like there's not one
that I'm like oh my god
yes I love this foundation like for
example if I were to think of something
right now it would be the new NARS
foundation that I'm currently loving but
if someone took it from me I could still
use some of the other foundations that
I'm loving as well so we're just gonna
skip right over that I'm gonna move on
to another hair product this hair
product I also have in my bag that goes
with me everywhere and this is color
well color Wow is a hair powder that you
put in your hair line to fill in any
sparse Ness just anything honestly I
have so many sparse areas like closer to
my baby hairs that when I put my hair
back it looks like I'm like losing some
hair there I don't know I'm a little
concerned I'm not sure but this stuff is
such an easy on the go you're in the car
you're like whoa what's going on here
let me fix this really quick make it
look fuller let's straighten out the
part here with a little powder give you
a perfect hair and it's just a lifesaver
it just makes everything look more clean
more sharp I love this powder I have to
have it at all times I mean even my
brother he'll be like oh do you have
your color wow so shady this next item
I'm sure so many people will say and
agree that they cannot live without okay
a beauty
I know there's a lot of beauty sponges
out there and I said I do like other
Beauty sponges but I know how to work
with it I know it's never gonna let me
down beauty blenders are the best for me
I love them I can't imagine going
somewhere and not having my Beauty
Blender it's one of those things that
I'm like did I ever get my Beauty
Blender oh my god like panic okay panic
this is just perfect and I love the
black one and I like the nude one I know
the colors some of the colors mean they
do different things but for some reason
the pink one is like kind of my least
favorite I don't know why it's like not
as squishy as these two in my opinion I
may be making that out but that's how I
feel okay I open the drawer I see a pink
one and I kind of like move it to the
side and go for these two I don't know I
don't know why but a Beauty Blender
gotta have it another thing that I have
to have okay is this morphe brush
randomly one day picked it up and I just
love it it's the g4t and I don't have
any other brushes in my can't live
without I almost feel like there's so
many dupes for so many different brushes
but this one it's actually been through
so much do you hear that it's tired it
is it needs to retire so this one is
just so great because it's the perfect
size perfect density I use it on my no
makeup days just to blend in my
concealer I could use it to blend in a
little highlight I could literally just
do like my fresh makeup look just with
this one brush usually I'll use this one
I spot conceal and I don't wear
foundation I just wear concealer over in
his spots and what I love about it is
that it's fluffy enough to not take off
the concealer you know remove the
product and it's like light enough to
just blend it in while keeping the full
coverage that I need doesn't take off
any product I just love this so much
alright so moving on let me tell you
guys I have temperamental under eyes I
do they do what they want to do they are
dry as hell one day and then the next
day they'll be perfectly fine and it
drives me nuts certain days I can't wear
a heart shape tape I just can't like
it'll be too drying for me in certain
days I can
like if I'm feeling good about myself
I'm like let me put on some shape tape
and to be honest I just put it like in
the hollows I won't put it close to my
under-eye but the concealer that will
never let me down the Becca aqua
luminous concealer mmm I remember the
name you see that this is in the shade
beige and this is just a great everyday
concealer if that's what you want it's
not super full coverage so if that's
what you want then maybe it's not for
you but for like an everyday a lighter
coverage this works for all occasions
for me I can make it work I can build it
if I want a little bit more coverage it
doesn't make my under eyes look dry and
I love this two spot conceal - I feel
like it gives the most natural skin like
texture opposed to something that as
much as I love the tart shape tape it's
a very thick texture so if you want it
to have like a no foundation look and
just a lot of tart shaped tape for me
personally that's a little too full
coverage to look as natural as like a
spot conceal of this and I just go
through this all the time I go through
so much of it telling you moving on
we're gonna go ahead and move on to
lashes you guys know I need a lash
Louisville lash have to have a lash
cannot live without an eyelash this is
also a tough category for me because you
know part of me was thinking well I
could work with other lashes but another
part of me it was like what is your
go-to like you bring this on every trip
no matter what you have to have it and
it was a tie between two same brand
House of lashes and it was clean the
ikonics or the iconic lights I'm wearing
the iconic lights right now you guys
know I love me the iconic that is like I
want my eyes to stand out I'm gonna wear
that but if I had to choose between the
two I think I would go with iconic light
which is a little bit thinner of a band
more fluffy not as heavy not as thick
and so to me I was like well this is
something I can wear with a light glam
or a full glam and still feel really
confident and comfortable and just for a
fact I always bring these on my trips no
matter what I don't even know what look
I'm gonna do but I bring the iconic
lights and I bring the iconic because
you just don't know what kind of what
kind of trip it's about to be definitely
picking between the two I'm gonna go
with
Chanukah light must have when you want
to have like a really pretty lit color
where it's sparkly and if you put a lock
that's too heavy it's almost like when
you open your eyes where did it go
but this one you can see the sparkles
through the lash which I like this next
item I was gonna just feel like you guys
are gonna be mad at me because it's sold
out but there's one thing that I go to
always have on my lips it is definitely
the dose of colors collaboration that
Katie and I did over the top gloss okay
this is the best gloss in my opinion not
because Katie and I made it but kind of
cos Katie and I made it we just
obviously made something that we will
loved so much and we wear it all the
time
so it's just my favorite and if you got
it I'm so happy that you got it but if
you didn't pick it up then my second
gloss that I always wear which is
actually what I'm wearing now and is so
beautiful and that is the fenty beauty
gloss balm it just looks so nice as well
and what I love about this is it's very
Universal as so is ours because it
doesn't have this one as it meant to
have a crazy undertone you could wear it
with anything or just bare which is
really how I like to wear it I'm wearing
the Fenton one bear right now and this
goes with everyone's skin tone it smells
really good mmm
so these are just my go-to everyday
glosses like you just want to be out the
door
boom boom boom put it on really quick
you don't have to wear anything
underneath I don't have to worry about a
lipstick a lip liner all that stuff is
just like I want to look fresh and I
want my lips to look slutty so these are
the two I go for the next item I'm going
to talk about is a face powder this is a
setting powder and this is the Charlotte
Tilbury airbrush flawless finish powder
I've been using this forever now I have
not once really changed it up of course
I always test product because that's my
job and I try things all the time but
it's the things that I go back to you
everyday that are always in my purse
that I'm putting in this video right so
this is the best powder because it's so
finely milled you can continuously put
this
your nose or anywhere you get oily
throughout the day and it doesn't cake
up or look like you've been just
constantly putting on your makeup all
day like it somehow finds a way to still
look fresh and just lightly powdered and
not crazy this is such a good powder for
the under eyes too if you're not into
baking because I that's not for
everybody you don't want to bake every
day I mean you might III feel like
sometimes I just want to really quickly
this works really well under the eyes
and also around the face it's just you
can put it all over there's no flashback
it's excellent I use the shade to medium
just melts in the skin I'm just bouncing
around here because I want to keep you
entertained I want to keep you here next
thing we're going to talk about is a
hair tie your tie say like what how
boring
no this is the best hair device that I
have ever used in my life so this is
what they call a bungee it is to put
your hair up and it is the best so what
you do with this is you hold your hair
up and then you take one side of the
hook you hook it into the base of your
pony and you wrap it around tight if you
want your hair snatched back or if you
have thick hair and you find that
wrapping a pony around your hair it's
like the forth wrap around is too small
but the third isn't tight enough you
know what I'm saying this will solve all
your problems so you wrap it around and
then when you get back to the base you
just hook it into your hair it never
comes out it never comes loose it is the
best thing ever actually I had a hair
stylist use one of these on me and my
face was lifted okay I was like I
couldn't blink but in the best way if
you try to do my hair in a ponytail
without this I can't really trust you
anymore you know like this is just the
best device ever you can order them on
Amazon they haven't met certain hair
supply stores they're life-changing and
it's also something that I have in my
bag because just in case I want to do a
snatched pony have to have this
obviously you guys know I'm not gonna do
a video like this without including a
brow product okay
there is one product that I feel like
doesn't do the same thing that any other
product does for me and
that is the benefit karo number four and
I could definitely use just a brow
pencil but I'm never gonna get the
feathery hair like strokes like I do
with this crowd this one is just the one
that works the best for me and I don't
want to use another brow product this is
the best I could live with this and
what's cool about it is that it also
cuts down on one of my must-have brushes
because it has a built in brow brush
also it's very very water resistant I
can jump in a pool I can jump in the
ocean I can get rained on I mean don't
wipe obviously it stays on if you just
give it a little pat don't ever wipe I
just love this stuff it's so good I mean
I can't live without it there's so many
things that I could put in this video
but I'm keeping it too wet like really
you can't live without so the next thing
I'm gonna talk about is highlight I have
to highlight category options the first
one is of course you guys already know a
go this is a highlight that Katie and I
created with dose of colors and it's
just the best like I love it so so much
I also love me Tamara which is the other
highlight but I'm a little bit less tan
right now you know cuz it's colder so
this just works better for my skin tone
now but they're both the same formula
and just so amazing I love the way it
looks like a wet sheen oh it's just
everything about it this is my go-to
everyday highlight I use it all the damn
time another product that I love to use
for glow and I picked this one even
though I do use a lot of liquid
highlighters you guys already know what
liquid highlighters I'm obsessed with
this is something that's very unique and
that I haven't really really seen
anywhere else and I feel like I can't
get the effect with a lot of other
products so Sephora perfect mist new to
glow this is a sephora product you give
it a little spritz on your cheekbone
which is a little difficult to spray I'm
not gonna lie it's like you have to get
the right angle do you see
did something happen or did it just take
it there let me tell you guys something
about this glow it is a spray glow not
super pigmented or anything but just has
just enough of a sheen that oh my god if
you're taking pictures if you're on a
red carpet
the
is just gonna be like BAM if you're
under lights it's gonna look amazing
honestly if you're getting married this
is so beautiful even if you're not a
huge highlight person you could just do
this a light spray of this and the high
points and in your photos you're just
gonna look so healthy without looking
sparkly flash photography you're taking
your senior portrait you're at your
quinceanera game over I don't know why
more people don't talk about it I'm
telling you guys it's it's amazing the
next item I cannot live without is this
mascara it's the Mack extended play
mascara this is another one of those
items that I'm just kind of like don't
give me any other type of mascara I will
use other mascaras the reason I mostly
love this one is for my bottom lashes I
don't really I could use any mascara on
the top lashes but as far as my bottom
lashes I feel like I need a tiny tiny
wand and I need a formula that's gonna
build up my lashes so that it looks like
I have more than I do and so far I found
that this is the one that does out the
best for me it just fakes people into
thinking I have a lot more lashes
and I just feel comfortable using it I
can't really speak for upper lashes with
this mascara because I don't use it for
that if I had to say up or mascara would
say like waterproof for sure but this
this for my lower lashes is it for me so
next up we have the mac cosmetics strobe
cream and this is in the shade gold
light there's a lot of like glowy
moisturizers out there a lot of things
that give you a radiance there's
something about this particular color
that I haven't seen in another glowy
radiant lotion and this doesn't have a
tint which I like it's just a strobe
cream I love it so much I put it on the
high points of my face
especially on no makeup days it gives
you little life without making you look
like you are wearing makeup because
you're not if you want to look good at
the gym because you're single on you're
looking to like you know meet somebody
that's not me but I'm saying if that's
you and you don't want to wear makeup
but you still want to look like hey this
stuff looks so good like imagine you're
under the gym lighting which isn't that
good but you just have a little strobe
cream it's like sets you apart from the
rest you know you're just mmm
I don't even know what it's like to be
single anymore I can't even like
remember the days maybe I don't want to
remember
nose drain rag mac fix+ this is tried
and true this is a staple this is just
like never fails me it's not something
that's gonna make your makeup last all
night it's not like meant to be an
all-night setting spray but it makes
your powders melt into the skin it makes
it everything look not powdery it makes
your highlight look way more intense if
that's what you want I use this to like
amplify my eyeshadows I use it to
amplify my highlight
sometimes I even use it to just like
cool myself down if I'm stressed like
and then I just feel like calm again if
I went somewhere I finished my makeup
and I didn't have this I would be kind
of like what do I do and the last item
that I cannot live without is hair
extensions okay hair extensions are a
must for me I feel like I love to add
more fullness to my hair sometimes I
want to wear my hair short but sometimes
I want long hair and it's just so fun to
change up your look and it's an easy way
to do that I've been wearing extensions
since I was like 18 okay 18 so if
they've been in my life that long it
tells me two things one I love
extensions to stop cutting your hair I
keep cutting my hair even if you have
long hair say you have like long hair
but it's not as full as you want I know
a lot of people who wear extension just
for fullness but it is fun to play up
your look change it up you know one day
you're sure one day you're long you can
have a long ponytail it's just so much
fun and and so easy to do and these are
the best they're from the hair shop the
hair shop I swear just has the color
that was made for me all their
extensions are like great blends there's
different types of extensions these are
clip ins and I like them because they're
just easy you don't have to sleep and um
at the end of the night you just take it
all off and you can sleep comfortably
these are a skin wet they're the
thinnest thinnest thinnest material here
you can see scalp through where the hair
comes out of it you can lay them as flat
to the top of your hairline as you need
to like right there and I could still
manage to hide them because they are so
thin I can't even imagine a time where I
would go on a trip and
bring my hair extensions I can't fathom
it no I cannot all right so that's it
those are the top ten beauty products
that I cannot I cannot live without I'm
curious to know if there's one product
that you guys can't live without like
just the top of your head leave it in
the comments down below and yeah thank
you guys so much for watching I'll see
you guys in the next video bye I've had
it since I was Shh
nothing wrong with a little beverage
it's past noon it's all good sounds like
there's what was that tired</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
