since I've been traveling a lot lately I
thought it would be cool to kind of
share my tips and tricks on how to keep
a glowing luminous complexion when
traveling I have two features one of
them is this line because I hate flying
I'm so terrified and I probably
shouldn't be watching lost while I fly
but I've been doing that recently too
which is not the best tip the second
thing that I hate about flying is what
it does to your skin traveling can
really have a bad effect on your skin it
could dry it out and sometimes I tend to
break out I've been doing a lot of
traveling lately and testing with some
products and I wanted to share a few
guys just my tips to keeping it luminous
glowing and healthy and I did team up
with SK 2 for this video I have a
product in here that I have been testing
out for a long time now and I really
really like it so if you guys are
interested in my tips then people so I'm
starting this off with a freshly washed
face no makeup the only thing I have on
is my brows because I have to have my
brows on this is one of the products
I've been using to help my skin it's the
SK 2 facial treatment essence this is
one of the first essence on the market
and they like to call it their miracle
water and what really got me into this
brand was the story behind how they came
about they actually came about from a
Saki Factory in Japan and science has
started to notice that the workers there
were aging like normal people do we age
but their hands were staying incredibly
remarkably like youthful they realized
that it was because a certain ingredient
that was derived from the Saki and that
ingredient is called and I hope I'm
saying this right peak data I will put
it here on the screen so when they
realize that it was due to this
ingredient they decided to put in all of
their skincare and this product in
particular is made up of 90% of that
ingredient so for me it was kind of like
I'm gonna put it on my face my neck and
my hands and I've been using it for
about two months and it's overall it's
going to make your skin look moisturize
and luminous directly after I wash my
face I like to just take a few drops of
this and the palm of my hands and I Pat
it into my skin so I'm just going to
show you guys you want to apply this
product before any other of your
products your moisturizers your serum if
you do use toner you can apply the
after your toner as well I started over
my lips I actually put it down my neck
as well and what if there's any left
over I just kind of put it on the back
of my hand and I've been liking it
because it gives me that really nice
dewy radiant glow II feel apart from
being a travel tip this is just a tip
for any time of your life
sheet masks are something that you could
wear every single day I mean I do the
reason I love sheet masks so much is
because I enjoy wearing them number one
and two I feel like I'm having an
at-home spa experience when I wear these
and I like to wear them when I'm doing
things around the house I actually wear
these on the plane as well the
stewardess always love when you wear
these on a plane it's a conversation
starter for sure and people love it so
when you apply sheet masks you just want
to make sure that they are nice and
smooth out but your skin is marinating
and goodness kind of like when you're
cooking the turkey you're basting a
turkey
you put the cheesecloth over it with
butter and it just pulls all the butter
and all the moisture and doesn't have it
in my face right now but with things
that are good for your skin of course I
would compare myself to a turkey and
here's another tip there's always liquid
from your sheet mask at the bottom of
the container you want to take that
liquid because it's good stuff all the
good stuff and you want to put it on
your neck don't throw it away your neck
ages and I know when you're younger you
don't think about it as much but when
you start to get older you'll think
about it more so make sure that you're
also bringing it down your neck don't
let it go to waste
very important and this is the SK - a
facial treatment mask another tip is
keeping your skin moisturized and
particularly when you're flying your
skin tends to get really dry so if your
skin is dry from us like or if you're
about to go on a flight and you just
want to look naturally radiant you can
always fake it with a cream like this
one this is the max strobing cream it
has reflective particles in it that are
going to give you that luminous look
even if you don't have it or if you do
have it it's going to give you a more
luminous look I always like to use this
when I go on a flight or after a flight
if I have somewhere to be
often times I don't like to wear heavy
makeup on flights but I still want to
look good I don't want to look tired so
I love to use the strobe cream
I first apply it on the high points of
my skin because it is very reflective so
it's going to give you that really nice
highlight down the bridge of my nose
chin and then whatever's left over on my
hands I'll kind of just blend it all and
Pat it in and if you do tend to have
problems with skin texture or any
breakouts just don't put this directly
over that because you don't want to
bring attention to those things you want
to just kind of put them on the high
points of your face and then maybe you
can use your normal moisturiser all over
that's just a tip the next tip I have is
using a lip treatment for your lips the
night before I mean you should always be
using a lip treatment but especially the
night before sleep with it heavy and
then on your flight make sure you keep
your lips hydrated this is the Murad
soothing lip it does give me a glassy
feeling while still hydrating my lips
it's not a gloss but I'll show you guys
so this lip treatment makes my lips
pretty glossy and I kind of like that
because it's protecting my lips and
hydrating them and it also gives you a
little bit of glam another thing I like
to do when traveling is applying these
under eye patches I also love to apply
these on the plane I basically make the
plane my little mini spa I put these in
my backpack these are the tart pack your
bag under eye patches a tip for these is
putting them in the refrigerator so you
put these in the refrigerator overnight
and when you apply them it's going to
help with any puffiness under your eyes
is going to make you look less tired so
almost like putting ice packs under your
eyes they look like this and you're just
going to want to put those under your
eyes whew when I wear these if I want to
wear these and the sheet masks I'll
apply these first and I'll apply this
sheet mask over top and I'll double mask
because it's serious like that skin care
for me as serious like that I love under
eye patches I just feel like they're so
small like so luxurious is just soothing
it makes me feel better about myself for
some reason when I take these on the
plane I will put them back in the
packaging and then put them in the mini
fridge at my hotel because you could
reuse these eye patches they're not just
one time you so take them with you put
them back in your bags and put them in
the refrigerator when you get to your
after I've had my spa day on the plane I
like to always have my concealer in my
bag so that I could spot conceal that
way when I get off the flight I don't
look like I'm not wearing makeup I just
want to have a little life to me so it's
really crazy how much concealer can
change up your look I feel like if you
just cover the redness around the nose
the under eyes and then spot conceal any
blemishes it makes a huge difference
without having to wear a lot of
foundation on your flight and it takes
two seconds so it's easy to touch-up
this is the NARS creamy concealer and
ginger what I like to do is kind of just
go through and spot conceal anything
that I want to cover up put a little
around the nose area and then I like to
take just a brush or you could even just
use your finger if you're on the flight
you know you don't want to have a brush
in your bag because I know it's kind of
tricky it can get dirty unless you have
a brush holder you can just use the
warmth of your finger to have that
concealer in it's going to give you a
more natural finish to technically
another tip you're supposed to use this
finger to Pat on your concealer because
it is the most gentle finger on the skin
and it's going to do the less damage to
your under-eye area so my last tip is
using a liquid illuminator I like to use
liquid opposed to a powder because when
I do this type of look I don't want to
have any powders on the skin just
because they tend to look a little less
natural and I want to look a little bit
more glowy so I'm going to use this one
this is the L'Oreal Lumi True Match glow
illuminator in golden a lot of people
asked how to apply liquid illuminators
because it can be a little bit tricky a
Beauty Blender for me is the easiest way
a damp Beauty Blender using the back of
one and that's because it just blends
out the liquid illuminator really well
so you want to put it on the high points
then I slip the Beauty Blender around to
the pointy part and I'll blend the edges
with that I'm trying to stay away from
my breakout Arthur because I don't want
to eliminate that and we already have a
glow from the strobe cream this is kind
of intensified that so you can do this
or you can skip this step if you do the
strobe cream but you know I like a
little bit more glue to your finger and
put that also on the tip of your nose
move down the bridge as you can see by
adding that highlight it just gives your
skin and even hell
here look this is really the overall
look that I'm going for it still looks
pretty natural it doesn't look like I
have a ton of makeup on and my very last
but not least important to drink lots of
water lots of water I know a lot of
people tell you that it's one of those
things that you hear over and over in
but you still ignore it drinking water
is going to help with the plumpness of
your skin it's going to just make you
look more radiant it's going to help us
break out and it's also going to help
with your under eyes if you have under
eye dryness if you feel like your
concealer is looking a little bit more
crusty I don't know I have that problem
sometimes my concealer looks really bad
and it'll make me age you it ages you
but if you drink a lot of water that
really helps combat those issues so make
sure that you're drinking a lot of water
especially on the plane I know we don't
like to get up and go pee 500 times but
I promise you drinking water on the
plane is going to help your skin so much
alright so that is it for my tips I hope
you guys enjoyed this video this is what
I like to do when I'm in flight I really
like this overall feel and has a very
heavy focus on skin just letting your
own skin shine through having that
luminosity and that all comes from of
course your skin care and then just a
couple of makeup products to help you
