if you guys didn't already guess by the
intro this is a collaboration with my
friends here on YouTube nikkietutorials
crispy makeup and betta beauty and we
all recently saw the new Taylor Swift
bad blood music video it is amazing if
you guys haven't seen it it's basically
a bunch of hot chicks kicking ass with
fierce makeup it's amazing so we all
decided to do a collaboration on it
because everyone has different makeup
looks even Taylor I think she has like
20 different makeup looks in the video
itself so we all picked a different look
make sure you guys head over to Nicki
crispy and Peeta's channel give them
some love subscribe to their channels
like their videos and comment and say
that desi sent you and yeah let me tell
you a little bit about my look this is
one of Taylor Swift's looks it shows for
like 2.5 seconds in the whole video it
just shows really quickly it's where
she's in the convertible I'll pop a
little picture up right here she's in
the convertible and she has this fierce
double wing look and it's mostly black
but then when you look really closely
there is a pop of blue right in the
center and I just love it so if you guys
are interested in learning how to get
this look then keep on watching okay so
I've already started off by applying a
base to my lids this is Mac soft ochre
and then I just set the base with the
powdered eyeshadow that was similar in
color that's because I want it to be
easier to blend and shadows are easier
to blend over shadows if I try to blend
all these colors over cream it can get a
little sticky and stuck in any rough
patches and we're gonna be using a lot
of dark colors so don't want that okay
so what I'm going to do is take black
eyeshadow with an angled brush and I'm
first going to kind of map out the shape
that I want
just because this look is really angular
I want to make sure they're even so this
is just a morphe 11 just gonna run this
along the eyeshadow base here kind of
like you're doing eyeliner just kind of
blending it out
so now what I'm going to do is just
start building more black eyeshadow on
top of this and feathering it into the
lid space here I'm focusing most of the
product on this outer corner and trying
to use whatever is left over to the edge
here just so it tapers off a little bit
lighter I find it easier to use an
angled brush like this because it
already has the shape that you need so
once I've built this initial shape with
the eyeshadow I'm going to take a little
bit on the brush whatever is kind of
leftover and then I want to make sure
that this cuts across slightly too so
I'm going to start blending this wing in
open your eyes to just see what it looks
like with your eyes open I can't believe
I haven't even used a blending brush yet
this is so unlike me I'm also going to
take this black all the way into this
inner corner of the eye also I'm just
taking this little small morphe 35o
and i'm going to go along the edges here
just to soften it up just slightly
though because you still want it to be
sharp like a weapon so you just really
want to get that like grunge look with
this because you know you're a badass
you've been fighting people all day
doesn't look perfect it kind of just
looks grungy so in the video Taylor had
navy blue towards the center of the eye
so I'm taking color pops shadow in Rex
and this is a navy blue it has like
purple flecks in it I'm applying that
with a makeup geek concealer brush
focusing it more in the center here like
how she has it I'm just going back with
that little blending brush and buffing
away the edges here this look is all
about how it looks when your eyes are
open so I want to really keep that
feline shape so I don't necessarily want
to bring any dark eye shadow into this
area
I'm going to focus most of the product
right here in the center and then just
kind of take whatever is left on the
brush and dab it in towards the black
okay so now that we have the shape all
laid down I'm going to go into my meat
mat mat meat I just see nude and it's
staring me off meat matte nude and I'm
going to take a brown color here
probably just this one and a little bit
of this one mix them together you guys
can take any Brown I'm going to wipe
most of it off on the back of my hand
and then whatever is left over I'm going
to use this to kind of feather out these
edges and just give a cohesive shape and
I'm not really doing windshield wiper
motions for any blending today I'm kind
of just um doing like these little
padding motions I don't really want the
eyeshadow to go up too high and I want
to keep the blend really soft so I'm not
using a big Brush and I'm more just
moving the product around some rubbing
motions and I kind of want to just make
the shape cohesive so so gold for I
don't want too much Brown in this look
but I feel like it needs a little bit
take a blending brush and just smooth
this out right here I haven't put any
product on this brush I'm just using it
to make sure that if there's any
stubborn areas that don't want to blend
out with the smaller brushes fluffier
brushes will always do the trick
alright so now I'm just going to go
ahead and take the same angled brush
that I've been using with a little bit
of my Inglot gel liner you guys could
use any black gel liner and I'm going to
create a pretty fierce wing I'm just
gonna follow the shape I already made as
I go and I'm just gonna kind of taper it
off really lightly because I still want
to keep most of the product on the
outside I'm going to go ahead and switch
to this little tart liner brush instead
okay so now before we finish off the
eyes I need to do the lower lashline but
before that I'm going to go ahead and do
my face I'm using the Loreal infallible
Pro matte foundation this is in the
shade fresh beige I've heard mixed
reviews about the foundation I think
it's phenomenal I've been wearing it
everyday currently I'm a little bit too
tan for this color because I just got
back from Mexico so don't mind the shade
difference so I also found that you
don't want to rub with this foundation
you just wanted to do padding motions
some people say it crumbled or like it
was patchy I feel like you need to Pat
it in but it is by far like my favorite
foundation right now it looks great in
photographs also alright so then we're
going to go ahead and do our concealer
I'm using the Maybelline age rewind
concealer I just used the shade
neutralizer that's what it's called and
I'm going to dab a little bit of this
under my eyes
put some took my nose I'm gonna use the
same Real Techniques brush that I used
for my foundation I know if I told you
guys it's the sculpting brush just
because it fits under the eyes and once
again you don't want to rub this you
want to Pat get those under wrinkles I
really like this concealer because it
highlights the under eye and it's also
really light as in it's not going to
crease as much what I'm trying to say is
it's not creamy so it doesn't really
settle in the fine lines and move around
and like mess up your mascara because
it's dry so that makes sense
if not then I don't know alright to set
my under eyes I'm using the Laura
Mercier translucent powder just gonna
take that on a morphe a twenty-five
brush this Laura Mercier powder has
become my favorite for studying the
under eye I wouldn't recommend it all
over the face though because I feel like
it does give like a flash all right so
we're going to bounce around back to the
eyes now
now that the under-eye concealer is all
done so I'm taking this really tiny
angled brush this one
oh my god look at my hands this one is
by morphe as well and it's from the Mac
Daddy set that he came out with with
them so I'm going to take this brush and
create the lower wing that Taylor has in
the video
this parts a little tricky for me so
wish me luck I'm first gonna go around
the lower lashline and I think as I hit
this part not all the way to the end
just right here it just looks like hers
comes here and then it goes straight out
oh I took that a little far so that's
just gonna be my guideline now I'm going
to build it up a little bit you can use
a gel liner if you want for this also I
just like to use eyeshadow because I
feel like it's easier if you mess up you
can take it away easier and definitely
use an angled brush like this because it
also gives you the perfect line so I'm
also going to take the inner corner here
and point it downwards as well all right
and then I'm going to go back into those
two brown colors that we used for the
crease on the same little blending brush
and I'm going to diffuse the lower lash
line this is gonna make it look more
worn in and like grungy so you can see
the difference how this one is like
diffused and a little bit more smoky
this one is just a little bit more blunt
and we want the more smoky look all
right so also in the video Taylor had
like white faded in this little triangle
so I'm going back into the nude palette
I'm just going to call it nude nude men
palette and this little angled brush
again and I'm just going to fade white
in that little triangle and then just
fade it out into this area so that it
kind of just blends you don't want like
an abrupt stop I'm also going to take a
little bit of white and just dot it in
this little extra space here okay so now
I'm just going to go ahead and apply a
quick coat of mascara this is benefits
roller lash and I'm just putting a
little bit of this because I'm going to
apply falsies and I'm going to go ahead
and apply a house of lashes iconic go to
make sure to really pop in those inner
corners it's the worst when they stick
out if you don't make sure to glue them
down good enough alright so as my lashes
are drying let's go ahead and finish off
the face I'm using Mac's give me Sun
mineralized skinfinish
and a Morphy III brush and I'm going to
use this to warm up my skin assuming
that I am a girl who can kick someone's
butt I feel like I should have a really
fierce contour so after I do this we're
going to give a real good contour this
is going to help give our contour a
slight transition shade so it's not
super blunt also because I am more tan
this is going to help kind of warm up my
skin all right so I'm gonna go into my
honest Aussie you contour kit and pick
up Havanna and I'm gonna just chisel out
the cheekbones oh and I'm using a zoeva
105 brush and then over the contour I'm
going to apply this cover effects this
is the illuminator and it's in the shade
sunlight and just to give my face kind
of like a nice glow I'm going to adjust
this all over and then I'm going to grab
a little bit of my mary-lou manizer by
the balm cosmetics put that on the tip
of my nose and the Cupid's bow one last
thing for the eyes I'm going to use this
NARS eyeliner pencil in the shade rue
Bonaparte in the waterline just to kind
of make that block that we put down here
pop even more so I'm gonna make my sexy
eyeliner face which is like and for
blush I'm going in with a light wash of
Amber Rose by Mac and I'm using the
morphe e3 brush alright so the last step
to the look is lips I'm going to use
Mac's oak lip liner I'm going to line my
lips and I think I'm just gonna apply a
gloss alright and if you guys can see
the way I lined my lips makes them look
a little bit more pouty I kind of just
put a line drawn on the center and then
two lines here gives you that kind of
Angelina Jolie kind of not really no no
big enough I tried but anyways I'm going
to apply a dose of colors undressed lip
gloss and I don't really want too much
of this either it kind of just felt like
a light wash so I'm just putting a
little bit of gloss over this I want it
to stay closer to my natural lip color
alright so I'm gonna go back into the
lip liner and just kind of redefine
those edges a bit alright that's the
last step to the makeup look and you're
done you ready to go kick some butt
