I got you tell my heat on me don't like
it had died
hey guys so super excited because
everyone's been talking about these two
faced melted lipsticks and today I'm
going to do a swatch I'm also going to
give you a few tips on long wearing
lipstick let's get started the first
thing we're going to want to do is prep
our lips just like it's important to
prep your eyelids for shadow application
the same concept applies to your labios
so what we're going to do first is apply
two-faced lip insurance which is
basically like their shadow insurance
but for your lips this is going to
prevent feathering and it's also going
to make your lips really soft for a
smooth application so for the lip
application I'm going to be showing you
guys melted fuchsia and I can tell right
off the bat that this product is highly
pigmented usually I would use a liner a
lipstick and a gloss but I feel like
with this product you can get the effect
of all three and one which is really
nice the formula is also really creamy
so it's applying really smoothly to the
lips the best part about this product is
that it's long wear so it's definitely
gonna last all day or all night she was
still naked inside of a casket and
sipping a flask when carried inside the
engine bring up this do
gipsy on the black love bundles of the
like it or none
we go one
