today's video is going to be a tutorial
on this makeup look now before you say
another cut crease more neutral shadows
hold up
you guys all highly requested this
makeup look after I posted on snapchat
and Instagram so the main focus of this
video today is not so much the shadow
colors that I use although I am using
the new sweet pitch palette but you face
it's gonna be more about the technique
of doing a cut crease when you have a
problem with an undefined let's call it
an undefined crease you know just like
something that's not as defined you want
to create your own crease this is really
what I'm doing and teaching you in this
video so if you are interested in that
technique then keep on watching so I
already have one eye
complete and the whole purpose of this
cut crease tutorial is to show you that
if you have no crease or if you have a
very little crease you can create your
own crease and still achieve the look of
having a defined lid so if you look over
to this bald I over here you can see the
crease here so if I were to just to put
the eyeshadow in this crease right here
you look really closely once I open my
eye and look normal
it starts to fold like an accordion into
there there it goes it's gone the crease
is gone so that's what happens with my
eyes this used to not be the case I know
I've mentioned it before but literally
my crease shape has changed recently so
I know I've said it and I've said an
upset and I think that's because I'm
adjusting to it but you know what I'm
adjusted to it now and so I'm going to
show you guys how I create the cut
crease now that I have this situation so
the first thing we're going to do is
take Mac soft ochre and you want to
prime the whole lid up to the brow bone
and I'm using a zoeva buffer concealer
brush taking just a really light layer
and applying it all throughout you need
so now taking a matte eyeshadow this is
standard with every eye look you want to
set any cream base and that way once you
apply any shadows into the crease the
shadows are going to glide smoothly
across the crease and it's totally okay
if this gets caught on any cream product
because it's the same color essentially
as the base so you don't really see any
of those harsh lines or edges so I make
sure to apply a lot more of the bone
shadow right here on the higher part of
the brow bone because that's going to
serve as our brow bone highlight I have
this little bumps here I don't know what
I put on my eyelid but it like gave me a
tiny little three bump situation going
on so now going into the Too Faced sweet
peach palette which smells ridiculously
amazing I'm going to pick up summer YUM
and I'm going to be using the lux e 231
which is one of my favorite crease
brushes at the moment so what I like to
do when applying the transition shade is
taking a little bit of that eye shadow
dotting some of it off on my hand that
way I can lightly map out the crease
shape because my crease all folds in
here this is where I would do it but
it's going to fold so if I do it right
here it will fold in and then there will
be no more crease so here though I don't
have the folding problem so I'm going to
start it normal along the crease here
but then as I get up into the higher
area I'm going to take it higher than my
crease and this is a more dramatic shade
you don't have to go into the brow bone
like how I'm doing here this area but
I'm going to because that's what I did
and as you can see I'm lightly
feathering this eyeshadow just so I can
get the shape down you don't want to go
in too strong right away I'm also going
to lightly shade it all the way out to
the outer part of the eye so as you can
see the shape is starting to come out
and then I'm going to blend that upwards
towards the brow bone but now I have the
least amount of product and this is
going to give us a nice gradient you
just want to buff those edges
make sure to be looking forward when
mapping out your crease because you know
if you aren't you may be looking like
this and then once you open your eye
your crease will not be where you want
it to be now that I have the essential
shape I'm going back into the same
eyeshadow and I'm going to start
deepening the crease closest to the
crease line so you want the shadows to
get darker as you get into this part of
the crease and then fade lighter as you
go up to the brow bone so we're going to
start putting more product here now this
technique may not work for every eyelid
because of course we all have different
eyelid shapes some people may not have
enough space above their crease to do
this but this is just how I found it
easiest so hopefully it'll work for some
of you and I know this palette is sold
out right now I didn't know before I
offered to do the tutorial but the good
thing is is that you could use
alternative shadows for this look so
next I'm going to pick up a dark brown
eye shadow you guys can use anything you
have at home I'm just using this dark
brown shadow from the tartlet palette
picking that up on a sigma firm shader
brush I'm gonna dust most of that
product off now I'm going to tilt my
head back and you want to place this
right into the crease but lightly it's
almost like a light Gray's just a light
Gray's there's really no pressure at all
on my hand and I'm lightly sweeping the
shadow upwards
you always have that blending brush to
go over the initial edges that you made
with that dark brown just to get the
gradient you want like a thicker I'm
using this thicker brush for the first
pass at the dark brown because I do want
it to go up slightly higher than my next
pass at the dark brown and if you get
any eyeshadow on your lid don't worry
we're going to go over that with the lid
color anyways now I'm just going to take
a smaller brush this one is by zoeva and
it's a detailed shader brush and I'm
dipping it straight into that dark brown
again and this is really just going to
go into the crease that we're making
you're trying to really create your own
depth so you always want to have the
darkest line where you want it to appear
the deepest I would like to be able to
eat cereal out of the deepness of my
crease once I've done with this of
course blending brush right next to me
with that leftover transition shade just
to buff edges as we go and you're
basically just going to keep building
that crease the next we're going to go
ahead and pick up this light peach color
and pack that onto the lead and I pick
up the wrong color oh that's not the
color I was supposed to pick up I meant
to pick up peaches and cream but I
accidentally picked up nectar this is
peaches in Korean this is my stir so I'm
going to go back into this color just
accept that there might be a little bit
of shimmer there so as I was saying
before I was rudely interrupted by
nectar you can apply a much more
exciting shade if you would like here I
want it to look extra opaque so I'm just
gonna continuously pack it on doesn't it
look like I just have the biggest lid
space right now
now we're actually going to take nectar
and this is going to be our inner corner
highlight so I'm just going to pop that
right here in this empty space that's
dying to be highlighted now it's time
for the wing and for the wing I will be
using the Smith cosmetics two of two
brush and of course my England
July nerd all right so I'm going to do
my eyeliner a little bit more straight
I'm first going to start off by lining
closest to the lashes to make sure
there's no gaps between the lashes and
the liner
I'm just going to make that line very
lightly just in case I mess up put these
little cracks right here and gel liner I
like to go in with liquid liner and fix
those because it's easier i'm using the
nyx matte liquid liner for this which is
a really great drugstore liner and if
your wing happens to connect to your
brow more power to you know let the wing
fly i'm going to take some of that gel
liner and also tight line the upper lash
line it is currently one am here while
I'm filming this I'm just thinking thing
I wish I could just slay the makeup for
the day but all I can think about is how
I have to take off is a nut gel liner
once I've done an English eyeliner
doesn't play it does not play the next
I'm just going to lightly coat my lashes
with some mascara this is one of my
favorites and it's the Tarte lights
camera lashes and of course I'm just
going to apply some false lashes these
ones are by flutter lashes and they're
the Salette lashes by makeup Shayla
she's a friend of mine and she
collaborated with them alright I'm just
going to go ahead and place the oops oh
oh
abort abort Oh alright so now moving on
to the face I'm going to do this really
quickly a lot of these steps you've
already seen me do I'm going to focus on
the steps where I'm using new products
so I'm going to be using the elsi
foundation I've used this foundation in
the past and when you first apply this
foundation it's a really light coverage
like just if you don't use a Beauty
Blender especially and I was like oh I
don't know how I feel about that when I
first tried it but then the creator of
this foundation which is Lilla she's a
good friend of mine she told me yeah you
can apply it in layers and use a Beauty
Blender even one layer is nice but like
I have a
blemish here you can still see so when I
found out I could layer it I started
doing that and it's honestly amazing and
the weirdest thing about the foundation
is that you could literally keep
layering it and it doesn't look cakey
and then once the foundation dries it
looks I don't know how to explain the
way it looks is almost as if somebody
just sprayed you with like a Photoshop
and it was like really tight and shiny
not shiny like oily but just satin and
like tight I love the way it dries I'm
going to go in with the first layer all
over and then I'm going to go in a
second time around alright so now it's
time for concealer I'm going to be using
the NARS creamy concealer in ginger you
guys know I usually always use this it
has more of a peachy tone so it cancels
out any darkness around the eyes and
brightens it up so I use that just in
the dark areas now I'm going to use the
NYX HD concealer this is in the shade oh
for brighter so this is going to be more
of a highlight type color I like to
always put the brightest concealer under
my wing also because it makes it look
more chat and buff it out my baby
Blender
then I turn the beauty blender around
and buff out this line so next I'm going
to go ahead and set the concealer with
the Laura Mercier translucent powder
just dip my Beauty Blender in there and
grab about this much I place most of it
here and then blend it upwards so for
bronzer I'm going to be trying out this
new one by urban decay and it's beach
bronzer in the shade bronzed let me
compare it to my Mac give me Sun just to
see just cuz I'm curious if so Mac give
me Sun is a little bit warmer which is
not always a good thing for all skin
types especially if you're more fair I
like that this has a more cool undertone
but we'll see if it's too close to my
skin tone let's see let's just see I'm
going to be using a sigma brush this is
a large angled contour oh it does show
up on my skin I like this bronzer just
going to go ahead and place that
everywhere I usually place bronzer for
the highlighter I'm going to be using
the Charlotte Tilbury film-star bronze &amp;amp;
Glow palette I like this highlighter
because it gives you like a nice Sheen
see that I'm also going to apply that to
the tip of my nose Cupid's bow and for
the blush I'm going to be using Mac
peachy keen this is one of my favorite
blushes by Matt I'm just using the same
brush that I used for my bronzer I don't
know what I got time to finish off the
makeup look we're going to do the lower
lash line I'm going to go back into the
first color we used in the crease which
is summer yum I'm going to sweep that
under the I really quickly just a nice
little smoke next we're going to take
the color pop liner this is in zulu and
these liners are phenomenal it's hard
for me to show this on camera because
you know i got contacts but i'm going to
try really hard yeah that's about as
much as I can show so I'm just going to
keep applying that until it does okay
as I want a fun way to incorporate color
into any look especially if you're more
of a neutral person is the waterline you
could do any color here you could
football gold world is your oyster my
friend do any color in the waterline all
right so now I'm gonna go back into the
dark brown color and really shade
underneath the liner we just put in the
waterline just to add a little bit more
depth especially along the outer part of
the eye alright so for lips I'm going to
be using a color pop liquid lipstick
this is new in the photo
I did the Beauty one that I created in
the lab with them but since it's not for
sale I decided to just use a different
color this one is Chi Chi Chi Chi Chi
and I'm going to use the color pop liner
in Taurus this is like a really brownie
color a girly nudie brown so I could
possibly look a little little see how it
looks on my skin tone oh okay alright
