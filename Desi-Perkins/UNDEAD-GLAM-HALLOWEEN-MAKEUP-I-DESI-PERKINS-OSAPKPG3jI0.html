so today's video is going to be another
Halloween tutorial clearly this look is
super easy to do if you don't have a
costume and you just want to use stuff
that you have at home I did this whole
makeup look with an eyeshadow palette so
you guys can use whatever you have at
home to recreate this super easy and I
feel like it still looks kind of glam
but you're dead so there's that my
inspiration was an old Hollywood star
who died but still wanted to look good
this is what came out I really hope that
you guys enjoy this tutorial and if
you're interested then keep on watching
alright let's get started first you want
to apply a foundation all over your face
that is a few shades lighter because
your dead obviously you need to look
more pale so I'm just buffing in a light
foundation and I'm actually mixing a
little bit of white paint to make it a
little bit lighter in the high points of
my face like my cheekbones and bridge of
my nose and I'm also going to apply a
little bit of that on my lips as well
and my collarbone so I'm only going to
be using eyeshadows for this tutorial
and I chose to use the balm cosmetics
meet matte nude palette this palette has
nine really nice matte shades that are
going to be perfect for our shading so
the first thing I'm doing is taking meet
Matt wood and I'm applying that to the
brows making them a little bit bushier
and darker and I'm going to go into this
grayish color and the brown shade there
and I'm going to start hollowing out my
crease and I'm taking it all the way
into the
a bridge towards the nose area and
flicking it out and I'm taking this
mixture and I'm also going to hollow out
the rest of my face so my cheekbones you
want to make those extra hollowed out
and of course you also want to define it
and bring it all the way down the side
of your mouth also going to use the same
mixture of shades to hollow out my
temples and of course I'm going to
contour my nose as well because I got a
stay contoured even in the afterlife and
use so much
I'm deepening up the crease with the
matte blue shade from the palette just
to give a really fierce cut crease
I love these eyeshadows because they're
super pigmented next you want to take a
black eyeshadow and smoke out your lower
lash line you could even smoke it out
more than this I think it would have
looked good if it was really really
smoky and I'm also going to flick it out
and make it parallel to the wing we made
at the top I'm taking that dark blue
eyeshadow and also shading under my lips
and in the center of my lips going back
into white facepaint I'm just going to
accentuate my lips just a little bit
more give them that foundation lip look
because I want it to be all very pale
I'm also going to take some of those
shadow mixtures and give myself somewhat
of a lip liner and I'm using my finger
to blend it away because I don't want it
to be super dark just a light lip line
and I decided to go back in and hollow
out some parts of my temples and my
collarbone to make myself look even more
sunken in and dead jawline of course
your jaw lines got to be cut
you guys can make this look prettier or
uglier depending on how you're feeling
I want the uglier route I gave myself a
mold because of course when I think
Hollywood star I think moles I don't
know why but I love them and I'm also
shading my nostrils and then of course
taking the white in the palette I'm
going to highlight because Who am I
without a highlight
I decided to go even crazier in the
under eye area and shadow that out just
a little bit more I will need to look
more dead and of course because I am a
glam dead person I got to put policies
on obviously I'm gonna give my hair a
little tease so it looks like I've been
through it and pop some contacts in and
that's it that's the final look alright
guys so that is it for this tutorial
really hope that you enjoyed it don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you did
subscribe to my channel if you're not

next one
