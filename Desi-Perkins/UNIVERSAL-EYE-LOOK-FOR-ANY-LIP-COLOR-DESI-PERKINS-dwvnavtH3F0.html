today's video is gonna be a makeup
tutorial I wanted to do a universal I
love that you can wear with any lip
color and I changed it up I have some
shimmers in the crease which I don't
usually do but I love the effect it has
under lights it's so beautiful this look
is super super easy while using not too
many products and I've also teamed up
with Dior Dior so I've teamed up with
Dior today to share with you guys the
Dior Addict lacquer plump lipsticks and
I'll be doing some swatches of the lip
shades to show you guys a few of my
favorite different colors and also to
show you that this I makeup look goes
with any lip color so if you guys are
interested in the tutorial then keep on
watching first thing I'm gonna do is
prime my skin this is the touch of silk
canvas primer and I just like to push
that into the pores now I'm gonna go
ahead and apply my foundation this is
the G way essential high coverage cream
foundation and this is the shade honey
beige so I like to dab it on first with
a brush and then I like to take my
Beauty Blender and just blend it out I
like to go ahead and just pop that over
my lids to just to get a little base the
goal of this look is to have the highest
impact with the least amount of work I'm
just gonna do a little concealing on the
under eye I'm gonna be using the beyond
perfecting concealer by Clinique and
that's the shade 18 and 20 I just do a
little mix of both and then you just
want to blend that on the under eyes now
I'm gonna go ahead and set the under eye
with a little translucent powder and I'm
gonna use the laura mercier to take a
little bit of that pop it under the eyes
all right now it's time to bronze the
face I'm gonna be using the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer I'm just gonna
swirl my brush in here tap off the
excess and I'm gonna start applying that
around the hairline first next I'm gonna
add a nice blush to the cheeks this one
is by Mac now we're gonna add some glow
to the skin I'm gonna be using the Dior
err nude highlight start by adding it
right up here give a little Sheen to the
skin of course down the center of the
nose I love that even though you could
have a matte full coverage foundation
going on that you could always add a
little glow to the skin to give you that
nice youthful glow from within type of
look a little here on the tops of the
cheekbones and then bringing it up here
in a C like shape I'm also gonna take
that highlight and just apply it right
here on the inner corners of the eyes so
now I want to add a touch of glam to the
eyes but still keep it very very simple
because the focus here is going to be
the lip so I'm gonna be taking this
really pretty rosy champagne shade right
over here on a flat shader brush I'm
gonna pick up some of the eyeshadow
first and then I always love to
intensify it for a more foiled look and
pop that right in the center of the eye
and you just want to pack this color on
and build the intensity picking up this
clean blending brush and I'm just gonna
start diffusing the edges normally I
like to put a matte color in the crease
but for this look I want the shimmer to
be diffused all the way up to the brow
bone and almost like a seamless wash of
shimmer across the whole eye I'm also
taking some of that Dior highlight and
applying it to the tops of the brow bone
and then we're really gonna want to
connect that lightly just to the C shape
here and then I'm taking a fluffy brush
and kind of just blending that all out
now I'm just gonna pick up a little bit
of bronzer on a pencil brush and you
could use any bronzer this is the
Guerlain bronzer and I'm just gonna
apply this on the lower lash line you're
just gonna kind of tie everything in I'm
gonna just curl my lashes boom I'm gonna
be adding some waterproof mascara this
one is by Too Faced and a nice light
coat because we will be adding falsies
to this look these are the salon perfect
fully stacked I feel like they're really
pretty and wispy I've never tried them
before so let's give it a shot what I
like to do when trying out new lashes is
I like to just take it off the band and
place it on my eye and I'm just gonna
give them a quick trim oh these are
gonna be really pretty alright so those
are the lashes I really love how wispy
they are so now it's time for the
exciting part these are the Dior Addict
lacquer plump lip inks and they are so
balm I'm gonna go ahead and apply a few
of these shadows for you so that you can
see how this makeup look works with
basically any lip color what I love
about these is they give a lip stain
once it starts to wear off throughout
the day there's still a stain that stays
on your lips so it keeps the color there
and once you apply this color onto the
lips the color intensifies even more and
it also has a lip plumping properties to
give you a little pout it has a really
comfortable wear and it makes your lips
look really hydrated and juicy you're
about to see the first shade I'm going
to be applying is 5/3
this shade is 777 and this shade is six
seven six
alright guys so that was it I hope you
enjoyed my little compilation of some of
the lip shades this is such a great
makeup look to pair with any lip shade
and that's why I love this eye look it's
really simple easy to do I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and don't forget to
give me a thumbs up if you did and I'll
see you guys in the next one bye

big head I said it's because I got a
very large brain so brighten those balls
