so today's video is going to be an
updated skincare routine video you guys
have been requesting this video for a
while so I decided to film it for you
guys today
so in the spirit of it being a skincare
video I decided not to wear foundation
today however I am wearing concealer
brows a little bit of mascara that's it
that's why my face is a lot lighter than
my body cuz I keep my face out of the
Sun skincare tip number one in the video
I'm gonna go over all of my baseline
skincare and then also all my masks that
I like to use and stuff like that I
really go into everything that I'm using
right now before getting started I would
just like to go over my skin type so
that if you guys have similar skin type
you just know what I'm judging these
products based off of I have normal to
combination skin really overall in like
these areas I tend to be more normal not
too dry not too oily but in the center
I'm a little bit more oily I do find
that my oiliness has gone down it used
to be a little bit worse but that
changes from season to season your skin
does tend to change but that's really my
skin type I don't have extra dry skin or
extra oily skin it's just kind of in the
middle so as far as facials I find that
they really really helped my skin they
kind of give you a fresh start it's like
a reset button on your skin and I get
those twice a year they just clean out
everything it's great I recommend
getting facials and then like starting
over on your skin that's what I did
that's pretty much everything that I
have to say so let's go ahead and get
into the video I'm going to show you
guys the products in order of how I
would use them starting with the Costco
makeup wipes they are super inexpensive
you can get a whole box of these for
$14.99 or something you get a huge box
of them where's my huge box you check my
huge box oh it's right here I guess it's
not that huge 150 wipes total Thank You
Steven the towelettes are really big
full face very sturdy and they remove
all my makeup and they're a little bit
more gentle than the Neutrogena wipes
for me or the Mack wipes I cannot use
the Mac makeup wipes they make my eyes
water these are really nice for
sensitive skin
I absolutely love them after I remove
all of my makeup with a makeup wipe I
always like to wash my face so there's
two different things
there's two different things there is
two different things that I like to use
as far as cleansing my skin I'm a huge
fan of oils cleansing oils like this one
by choose Beauty which is my absolute
favorite cleansing oil and I feel like
I've tried a lot of at this point and
this one is just the best for me on a
daily basis I would say that I usually
cleanse my skin after makeup wipes with
this juice BD cleansing oil it's just
really soft it makes my skin look juicy
supple just like glows after you use
this I've said it before many times but
Stephen says it makes my face look like
a baby's butt I love that when I rinse
it off if your skin just glows
afterwards I always go back to this I've
tried other cleansing oils that's just
like my go-to now I wanted to quickly
talk to you guys about the difference
between the Dermalogica pre cleanse
because I have showed you guys this
before and the cleansing oil the
cleansing oil for me is more of like a I
use this to cleanse my skin all the time
the pre cleanse is more of something
that I use when I have a lot of makeup
on and I want to remove it so this will
be in place of my makeup remover wipe I
don't use this to like actually cleanse
my skin but I've gotten a few questions
between the difference and cleansing
oils this one for example if I have like
Inglot gel liner glitter cut crease this
is what I will use in place of the
makeup wipe because it's so much more
gentle whereas a wipe rubs and you don't
I know my nails broken by the way
whereas like a wipe rubs on your eyes
and this is just like glides right over
I've done a demo of this on snapchat
where I just one swipe and I had full
glitter full liner and everything just
went away in one swipe so I only use
this one I have a lot of eye makeup and
I want to remove it this is the best for
show three times a week I like to give
myself a deeper clean and make my skin
feel like brand-new like starting over
for that I will use my Clarisonic in
combination with my Murad refreshing
cleanser I've been using this for about
two months this is the Clarisonic I've
been sleeping on this a lot of people
talk about it and they've been talking
about it for years but the reason I
didn't use it because I heard people
were like I broke out using it so I
freaked out when pee
we'll say they break out from something
I'm like no I don't want to use it so I
have an esthetician and she's amazing
and I asked her what are your thoughts
about the Clarisonic I love to ask her
about skincare because she's so
knowledgeable and she just loves to
teach and I love to listen she told me
that the reason people may be breaking
out and this may not be in all cases you
have to really make sure to cleanse your
skin make sure that when you're using
the makeup wipe you look down and
there's nothing left on your face
because if there's still foundation on
your skin and you're using the
Clarisonic you're basically like just
really harshly pushing the makeup into
your pores into your skin and it's just
that could make you break out I use it
with the Murad refreshing cleanser these
are not like the Murad cleanser is
because it does break up makeup without
over-drying your skin I like the fact
that it foams up because I like the
foaming cleanser with the Clarisonic and
it also is hydrating I look for
hydrating products all the time because
I just feel like the more hydration I
pump into my skin the more supple its
gonna look so anything that's gentle if
you have a gentle cleanser already that
works for you it's not like a
make-or-break deciding factor in my
opinion feel like any gentle cleanser is
really good for all skin types so just
find one that works for you and use that
next we have serums they're like a big
thing in my skincare I'm going to start
with one that's diehard this is the
Murad complete reform with glyco firming
complex and it is from their age reform
line so what this is going to do for you
is help with texture with fine lines
wrinkles and the softness of your skin
like it makes my skin look really really
smooth like you know what I mean after I
cleanse my skin I apply a little dollop
of this all over you can apply it to
your neck as well just really get it
into the poor areas anywhere I have like
texture this stuff is everything to me I
stopped using it for a little bit mostly
because I when I run out of products I
like to try other products so that I
could you know review them for you or
discover amazing new things but honestly
I didn't find anything that replaced
this as far as anything for texture this
stuff is everything to me I stopped
using it my skin went crazy the minute I
started using it again my skin went back
to normal it may be in my head but this
is like something that will stay with me
forever
like I have a very close relationship
with this I think it's around $75 but
you can get it on Amazon for cheaper I
think it's like what babe
40 bucks just saying it's awesome
another serum that I've been using up
what the hell there's some there's some
residue on this you the lid of this
could not look any grosser hold please
let me clean this off for you guys so
embarrassing so the next one is the skin
suta coles advanced pigment corrector
what this is going to help with is any
hyperpigmentation if you struggle with
that I tend to get dark spots after I
get a breakout and it'll stay there for
ever it is the most frustrating thing
and when I was breaking out like crazy
over here I just ice they're they're
going away now but it's because of this
I just got all these little spots that
didn't go away so it's like when you
don't have makeup on the rest of your
skin could look nice but you have these
little spots that make everything look
uneven so this has really been helping I
started using this and I wanted to use
it for a while and so I could give you
guys a good review it started to
diminish pigmentation of the spots so
quickly that I was like this is my new
favorite product for that so I've been
loving this I did mention it in my
favorites video so I won't go too far in
depth even though I just did after you
apply your serum you want to apply your
moisturizers and
I like to use this one this is by Murad
it's the anti-aging moisturizer of
course anti-aging keyword for what I
look for in skincare this one is for
blemish prone skin sometimes I find
sunblocks too I don't want to say break
me out but I feel like sometimes they do
my train of thought is if this is all
ready for blemish prone skin then it's
not going to make me break out you know
what I mean and it does hydrate and
protect I always look for the words
hydrate age those are the two things
that I look for so this has been working
really well it does have SPF of 30 so I
get my moisturizer and my sunblock in
one I don't really have like so much to
say about this it's not like oh my god
this you know but it just works for me
doesn't make me break out it does the
job so this is what I use for my daily
moisturizer for my nighttime moisturizer
I have been using this and I've been
loving it
this is h2o beauty
water bright bright another keyword
illuminating night cream illuminating
also another word that I love this helps
restore a more radiant even skin tone
you can totally see the pattern in all
my products I like even skin tone I like
to be radiant I think this is things
that everybody likes but his extra
hydrating and what I really like about
it is it has I don't know if you can see
it just push down and the product comes
out there you go so it's really nice
because you don't have to dip your
fingers into a jar I hate doing that
because it's really unsanitary some jars
come with little scoopers but it's like
let's be real that scooper is just gonna
like get tossed around somewhere and
then we're going to lose it then we're
gonna end up using our fingers again so
I really love the the pump that it comes
with at night I will apply this after my
serums all over my face all over my neck
and it just feels like my skin is
drinking glasses of water it's really a
spa-like experience using this and this
is definitely something that I'm like I
just want to keep using this forever
whereas some products I'll like switch
out but I'm loving this product I know
it looks like I have a lot of skincare
going on but it's because I do I'm like
a skincare freak media she is 87 and she
looks bomb AF and she uses so much
skincare so I've always been like
obsessed with skincare just warning you
guys under eye care is one of the most
important things in my opinion because
it's hard to fix it's a very delicate
area of your face once you get those
under eye wrinkles it's like sucks it
happens to everybody and there's ways to
prevent it happening sooner or less
severe let me tell you guys I had the
driest under eyes and they were really
really bad I was like really upset about
it I was like oh my god like I'm getting
under eye wrinkles freaking out when I
film like it just gets really Creasy and
it like made me feel really insecure and
I thought like oh my god I'm just like
getting older and it's happening it's
happening and I was really freaking out
let me tell you the number one tip I can
give you guys about under-eye dryness if
you have a lot of creasing or if you
find that you're creasing more than
usual it's mostly due to the fact that
you're not drinking enough water I know
everyone says drink water drink water
drink water it's
it's like when your parents tell you
something and you know that you're
supposed to do it but you don't do it
let me tell you if you are struggling
with like dry under eyes and you think
it's like really bad wrinkles drink a
lot of water and see how much that's
going to change Katy was literally
forcing me to drink more water my
undereyes changed 100% no matter how
much I cream you use like yeah that's
going to help and your eye products are
going to help but the water is key
that's my number one tip so now that
I've given you that lecture let's talk
about under-eye products there's two
products that I love before my undereyes
this one is by cope re and it's coconut
melts like a coconut oil it comes in
this huge tub because this is
multi-purpose you can use coconut oil in
your hair your body everywhere you can
just bathe in coconut oil it's good for
everything oh it smells so good this is
something that I like to use at night
because coconut oil can get a little
runny if you put it somewhere it'll like
drip sometimes even when I use this I
want to make sure that I'm not going to
be watching television in bed because if
I put it anywhere like right here it'll
like drip down up into my eyeballs I
like to use this when I know I'm just
gonna go straight to sleep the coconut
oil has worked amazing so I love this
stuff super hydrating it comes in a huge
jar so if you're looking for more bang
for your buck coconut oil is great it's
worked for me for my under eyes this one
I'm just started using it's by here we
go again
coup de lis goody somebody please am I
saying it right we didn't say it right
what was it
kita Oh dolly did I have an Irish accent
all of a sudden I'm trying to like
channel my inner French that I don't
have experience in this is just their
eye cream and it's all in French
so I can't say it I like this eye cream
I've been using it I'm not going to say
too much about it because I haven't used
it that much I've been using it daily I
wore it today so the reason I've been
liking this is because it is lightweight
it has like a nice texture it's not
super heavy if I use any under-eye cream
that's too heavy I get those little
white bumps I believe they're called
mila somebody will let me know but yeah
i get those little white bumps and i
hate them so something that's
lightweight this has been really nice
now we're going to move on to extras
that was my baseline skincare this is
all the extra stuff that i like to use
this is my go to mass at the moment it's
the red clear skin glycol active
Radiance renewable masks this stuff is
everything I've never used a product
from this line and I just picked it up
one day in my skincare and I was like oh
my god this stuff is everything let me
just talk about the smell this smells
like a Mexican candy like I can't put my
finger on which Mexican candy it reminds
me of something and if anybody has ever
used it and is a Mexican candy fan
please tell me which one it is I like it
I enjoy the smell of it it's like a
little bit like Mexican mango II this
mask does is it kind of just helps with
the texture helps reduce the appearance
of large pores fine lines suppleness
just like you know makes you look
snatched basically I don't think this
helps with breakouts so this isn't like
my breakout you know mask if you do need
a mask for blackheads or anything like
that charcoal masks are best that's what
I tend to use I've used a bunch and I
found that like they all kind of work
the same the charcoal masks they're good
but they are all good just get a
charcoal mask put it on your nose if
you're looking to look snatched with
smooth radiant even skin tone this is
everything all you got to do is put it
on it's like a nice clear orange texture
so it doesn't dry you don't peel it or
anything like that
it stays moist all over the face and
after 10 or 15 minutes I usually leave
it on for 20 minutes because that's what
I do I get like a washcloth and I just
kind of removed the mask rinse my face
you're done and I apply masks straight
from cleanser so if you're using a mask
you want to make sure that your face is
clean don't put anything else on your
skin then put your face mask on this is
after face washing if you do do a mass
next I would like to share with you guys
my on the spot treatment which I've used
in every single skin care video I use it
all the time on snapchat it's never
changed just always been the same tried
other other on the spot treatments and
still my Mario Badescu drying lotion is
my favorite recently I heard that the
Kate Somerville one was better than the
Mario Badescu a drying lotion so I
bought it the Mario looks just like this
like the container everything about it
except it says Mario Badescu here this
is the Kate Somerville one for me
personally it burns my eyes even if I
put it anywhere near my eyes I think
when I sleep or like I don't understand
but every time I've used this I wake up
in the morning and my eyes were like
burning I probably won't be using this
Kate Somerville one anymore just in case
you guys wanted my like experience on
the - I don't have the Mario Badescu one
on hand because I did buy that in place
of that to try it out I'll like insert a
little picture of the Mario Badescu one
here that is my all-time favorite I
don't think it's going to change it
always works for me
I'll show you this bottle for an example
what you want to know about the Mario
Badescu drying lotion is that you don't
want to shake the bottle there's a clear
liquid and then the bottom there's like
a pink sediment keep those two separate
so you just never shake it you're going
to get a q-tip and you dip it all the
way down to the pink sediment and then
you just put it over all your breakouts
I usually do this at night and I sleep
with it and in the morning I just you
know obviously wash it off it works so
well for me and I've never found
anything that works better if you guys
have any on the spot treatments that you
recommend I always like to look for
really good ones because who doesn't
want to just like kill that pimple the
second it arrives on your face so this
is another extra and this is like
over-the-top pampering if you want to
pamper yourself I love these under-eye
patches and I don't mean just under eye
patches like these specific ones just in
general under eye gel patches I am
obsessed with them because it just makes
me feel like I'm at the spa I'm
pampering myself the ones I have here
these are new from Tarte I just tried it
this morning the pack your bags under
eye gels and then here I have the Peter
Thomas Roth these are the 24 karat gold
one they have like gold glitter they're
really pretty I don't think it's worth
the money these ones so if you have been
looking to buy these they're so
expensive and I didn't see them do
anything different than any other
under-eye gel mask so that's just my
opinion but I'm still gonna use them I
still like what they do but I don't
think they do anything more than like
the normally priced under eye gel pad
that's all I'm saying
I love to use these in the morning when
I wake up I just place these on my under
eyes while I do my eyebrows cuz you guys
know I like to do my eyebrows before the
rest of my makeup once I'm done with my
eyebrows I take them off and that's it
and I just feel like I'm treating myself
it just makes me feel like you know
spa-like so this is not like a
City to me but it's more of just like a
I feel good about myself when I use them
these are super extra but I just wanted
to point them out that the under eye gel
patches I absolutely love them and why
not you know why not but will I say that
they always like do so much for me no
probably not but it's just like the
feeling of feeling good about myself so
the next thing I have are sheet masks I
am obsessed with sheet masks I think I
almost use these like every other day if
you follow me on snapchat you guys know
that I'm obsessed with any type of sheet
mask I don't really care what brand I
don't have one that's like oh this one
is the best I picked them up in line at
Sephora sometimes so these are all just
from random brands this is dr. jart
water replenishment this one is an
all-nighter so it awakens your skin and
replenishes it this one is to detox and
this one is pre party prepped these are
from masquerade unlike a mask like this
I wouldn't use this every day because
it's harsh but these are just more
hydrating so I feel like I could use it
more often just makes me feel great
coming home from a long day rinsing off
all my makeup putting on a robe and then
just like applying a sheet mask laying
on my couch and watching devious maids
that's like what I dream to do all the
time you guys haven't tried sheet masks
just for fun have your girlfriends over
wear sheet masks it just does something
for my soul I'm like obsessed with
skincare it really makes me happy two
more products and then we're done the
last two products were in my last
favorites video so I don't want to go on
too much about them but they are
skincare related so I'm going to talk
about them in this video this is just my
Murad lip treatment this you could use
on your cuticles it's kind of like a
multi-purpose lip treatment it's what I
have all over my lips right now a lot of
people think it's a gloss it's not a
gloss it's almost like a Vaseline type
texture it just makes my lips look so
like juicy and hydrated you can sleep
with this on once I apply this it's
there it's there all day unless I wipe
it off this is just like my Holy Grail
chapstick I guess you could say and then
lastly I'm gonna talk about this uh name
cool do you know coat we already forgot
I
we'll get the name pronunciation of this
brand I'm so sorry - the brand for not
pronouncing it right I've looked it up
and I still say it wrong this is the
beauty elixir it gives you a smoothing
glowing complexion like I mentioned in
my last video I usually like to apply
this before the gym so that I do have
the glowing complexion I did spray this
all over prior to filming it still gives
your face that overall glowy look
without having to wear any makeup which
I really like if you have oily skin I
don't know if I would recommend it
because it does make you glow so much it
may possibly make you look a little too
oily let me know if you've tried it and
you have oily skin and that happened to
you I'm really curious to to know your
thoughts I really recommend this for
normal to dry skin I mean look
everything is glowing it's this spray
just this so that's it that's all my
skincare I know this video must have
been extra long because I'm a huge fan
of skincare it's one of those things
where you know how some people love to
buy lipsticks some people are huge blush
people you just gravitate towards a
certain thing I honestly think that my
gravitation goes towards skincare it's
something I'm like really passionate
about I feel it's so important to take
care of your skin so I really enjoy
talking about skincare with you guys and
I love to get your recommendation so let
me know in the comments below if there's
like a Holy Grail must-have product that
you guys use that you think I should try
or if you guys have tried any of the
products that I talked about and they
worked for you or maybe they didn't work
for you also let me know and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye welcome
