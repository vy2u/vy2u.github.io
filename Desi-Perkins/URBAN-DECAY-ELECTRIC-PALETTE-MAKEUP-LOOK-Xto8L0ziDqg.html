yeah
all right guys let's get started so with
any eye shadow look we're going to start
by applying a base and this is urban
decay's primer potion and we're just
going to Pat that all over the lid for
an intense creaseless color application
I'm taking foxy from The Naked 2 palette
and I'm going to apply that all over my
brow bone and on my lid as a base color
now pick up this beautiful color called
savage from the electric palette and I'm
going to apply that to the crease and
just blend it out slightly so that it
looks like a nice pink haze now it's
time to add definition to the crease so
I'm going to pick up Urban from the
electric palette and apply that to the
socket line you want to make sure to
keep this color focused in the socket
line and not bring it up past the pink
shade that we laid down earlier I'm
going to pick up the brush that came
with the palette and add a little bit
more of that purple color and just use
this to define the crease and wing it
out
now pick up this gorgeous lime color
it's called thrash it's one of my
favorites in the palette and I'm going
to use this on the outer corner of my
eye
now this next shade has the cutest name
it's called gonzo and I'm gonna take
that with the Urban Decay brush and just
place it right under where I place that
purple sort of in a cut crease fashion
so taking thrash again I'm going to
place this on the inner corners of my
eye
and I'm just going to feather this into
the foxy shade that we placed down
earlier by doing this I thought it would
make the look just a tiny bit more
wearable for those of you who aren't
used to color then I'm just blending the
gonzo in just a tad time for some winged
outliner so I'm going to take this Urban
Decay 24 hour waterproof liner and I'm
just going to you know create a wing
like I always do
picking up black velvet 24-hour liner
from urban decay I am going to line my
waterline and going back in with gonzo
the blue used earlier I'm going to place
that on top of the liner pick up thrash
and blend that blue liner out just so it
has a nice gradient it's time for
mascara so I'm going to apply a big
fatty mascara by urban decay to my upper
and lower lashes pop on some falsies if
your little heart desires and then your
look is complete I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and that it inspired you to
be electric
are you up
