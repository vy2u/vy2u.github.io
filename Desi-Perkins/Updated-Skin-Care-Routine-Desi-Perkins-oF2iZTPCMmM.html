today's video is going to be a chit chat
video all about my skincare so it's not
the most like exciting video you know I
can't have any like slow-mo intros where
I'm like you guys have been requesting
this video for a while now I do have two
other skincare videos and one of them
does show me actually doing all the all
the steps however I'm not going to show
you all the steps here because it's
pretty self-explanatory it's like face
wash lotion you guys know the drill
so I'm just going to talk through all
the products how I use them when I use
them what they do what skin type they're
good for I'm not like super a skincare
professional I don't know more than the
average person knows I do what works for
me and I don't have like a crazy
different regimen for my nighttime
skincare than my daytime I kind of just
tend to use the same products maybe
throw in a few different things but for
the most part it all stays the same so
if you guys are interested in my
skincare regimen then go ahead and keep
on watching I'm not really picky about
makeup wipes
I love certain makeup wipes for certain
things but for the most part it's kind
of like it when I was there you know so
I've picked up the Neutrogena makeup
wipes anytime I'm like really taking it
on which is which is a lot of the time
um I'll take a makeup wipe first just to
kind of remove as much as I can I have
currently switched my face wash to a
cleansing oil this is the cleansing oil
I use it's by Juice Beauty and it's
called the stem cellular cleansing oil
this says that it softens and purifies
dissolves makeup so the minute I saw
dissolves makeup I was like okay I want
that I find that a lot of face washes
don't get rid of makeup it's almost
never that they do especially with
Inglot gel liner any gel liners for that
matter explaining this process to you
because it's a little bit different than
a face wash so what you want to do with
this product is just dampen your fingers
first and then I take a few pumps of it
and work it into my skin while it's dry
you don't want to have your skin wet you
really want the oil to break up all the
makeup before you mix it with water
and it really does it just dissolves
everything away it's really gentle I use
it around my eyes just to dissolve any
waterproof mascara or anything like that
and it really gets everything off
another thing that I love about this
product more than the fact that it gets
rid of all my makeup is that after I use
this my skin looks like a baby's butt
like no joke it looks so hydrated and
luminous I noticed when I first started
using this product which is a while ago
that even-steven my husband was like
your skin looks so like it's like
glowing like it looks really good and I
thought who puts this closer works so
good about three times a week I like to
exfoliate my skin exfoliating is super
important for anyone's skin care it
doesn't matter what kind of skin type
you have I just think it's really good
to exfoliate every once in a while just
to get rid of any dead skin that may be
clogging your pores and making you break
out even more actually so three times a
week I have been using the Murad skin
smoothing polish which is this little
guy here I think I may need a new one
soon coming on empty this is probably
the best exfoliator that I've come
across and I will tell you guys why so
finely milled the actual product itself
isn't a really abrasive exfoliant it
really is a skin polish that's what it's
called but it feels like you're
polishing your face my skin always feels
great after I do it I haven't had any
breakouts from it I haven't you know had
any problems and it says that it helps
relieve congested Poor's has witch hazel
cinnamon extract and it visibly tightens
your pores and balances oil production
so if you produce a lot of oil if you
have oily skin this is a really good
product for you this helps with
blackheads it helps with any congested
you know especially around the nose area
if you have issues with that this is
really good for that as well so highly
recommend this once I get out of the
shower you want to just pat your face
dry I never rub my skin I used to just
try to rub my eyes with the towel and my
mom would yell at me and now I know why
because nobody wants wrinkles but when
my pores are still nice and open I
really like to apply this right away
this is
the Murad complete reform with glyco
firming complex and it's from their age
reform line and if I could thank any
product for my skin the way it is today
it would be this one
I've been using this for a long time it
was in my last skincare video and I just
feel like I could never stop using this
it helps with the suppleness of your
skin the firmness of your skin the
elasticity any wrinkles fine lines also
helps me I find with dark spots I you
know I'm darker skin I'm latina and I
feel like every time I get a pimple I
would get a dark spot afterwards and it
would take forever to go away every
single time I got a pimple I was like
great now I'm going to have a dark spot
and I don't get those anymore I honestly
can't even remember the last time that
I've gotten a dark spot which is insane
to even think about at this very moment
because I haven't really thought about
it until right now it's just a really
great product
I think this for my smoothness of my
skin and I'm just spending a little bit
more time talking about this product
because I really do believe in it and I
just feel like hands down my favorite
item of all times so that's that and
it's just like a serum so you apply this
before you apply your moisturizer this
is my moisturizer that I use I pretty
much use this day and night so this is
the Juice Beauty stem cellular
moisturizer it increases cellular
turnover which is nice it replenishes
restores and renews your skin and this
smells amazing and I love the packaging
all you guys can't really you can't
really see it has a little circle here
and it's a pump you push this and the
product comes out a lot of times I don't
like jars because you have to stick your
hands in there it gets so full of
bacteria that it's just like why am I
even using this this is just so smart
the reason I love this moisturizer is
for really one main reason and that is
because after I apply it my skin absorbs
it really quickly and I don't feel
greasy there's a lot of moisturizers
that when you apply them after you feel
really oily or greasy especially with
nighttime moisturizers this one is good
for date and night so I find that's just
easier I don't really want to use two
creams for day and night I'm kind of
lazy like that I mean I'm
sure someone's going to tell me I should
but I just don't so this one is amazing
smells really really good at smells like
lemons like I don't like lemons it's a
great moisturizer I don't break out from
it I love the smell I love the
lightweight texture of it and that's
about everything all right so um my eye
cream rolled off somewhere I don't know
where it went maybe it took a vacation
or something I've been going on vacation
a lot and I just recently had an
overnight bag and I don't know where
when I will pop a picture up of it right
here it's the Mack eye cream but the
reason why I like this under eye cream
is for pretty much two reasons it's
super hydrating so if you tend to have
really really dry under eyes this is a
great product and not only is it really
hydrating but I also really appreciate
that it's lightweight because most I
moisturize herbs can be so thick and so
heavy so far I found with this one that
my under eyes look really really
moisturized I'm not having a lot of
creasing with my concealer as I was
before I mean it was really bad before
it feels like your under eyes are
drinking a glass of water that's how
hydrating it feels it differentiates my
skincare from daytime to nighttime is
pretty much just two items so in the
daytime when obviously I'm going to be
in the Sun I always wear sunblock
you guys should always wear sunblock you
can use a moisturizer with sunblock but
I kind of find that like the SPF amount
that's in moisturizers is never enough
for actual protection for my skin
I think SPF 15 is a joke I don't think
that's real I don't think that does
anything I think it's just kind of like
kind of a gimmick because I think
there's a certain percentage that you
need higher than that in order for it to
actually really protect your skin so I
always use the Tarte this is so cute
I've been loving this and it's like a
nice little pump
it's the Tarte guard this is SPF 30 and
it's just a sunscreen for your face so
I'll apply this during the daytime the
item that I use at night now which is
something new to me that I've been using
lately is the
Luna sleeping night oil this I apply
pretty much after my whole skincare
routine I apply this and you want to
just apply about four drops of this to
your hands it's a blue oil it's pretty
blue and you take it and I like to just
Pat it into my skin everywhere
especially anywhere that you're prone to
get wrinkles any large pores anything
I've been using this for I want to say
about three weeks now I'm still new to
the product I will not yet rave about it
because it's really expensive and I want
to make sure that it's something that I
would repurchase before I tell you guys
oh my god it's like amazing a retinol
type product and what it does is it
helps reduce the depth of fine lines
wrinkles correcting damage caused by the
sun pollution lifestyle stress and it
actually helps to create firmer clear
more translucent skin and it looks it's
supposed to give your skin a more
youthful healthier looking complexion
and reduce pore size that's what this
claims to do I will tell you guys that I
have definitely noticed my skin looking
I don't know around this area here I
have I don't know if it's like mental
but I feel like it looks tighter like
less pores not less pores but just I
don't know how to explain it I just feel
like any pores that have been large look
a little bit smaller I don't know if
it's mental or not but I have noticed it
looks really nice who knows like I
haven't really got a grasp on it and
I'll keep you guys posted via snapchat
however I can to let you guys know
because it is expensive I think this
bottle is like $120 or something like
that and I just spilled a lot of it so
I'm pretty upset a very specific smell
if you're very sensitive with smells you
may not like it I am sensitive to smell
but I find that actually like the smell
it has a very spa-like therapeutic type
of smell and
you put it on before you sleep kind of
relaxes me so I'm okay with it yeah so
that's just what I use at night but then
I have my last two items which are my
face masks that I love and my
on-the-spot zit
remedy any time I feel like I'm gonna
get a pimple and you just know that it's
going to come and like just up your life
like it's going to be there for a week
at least it's going to like take up
residence on your face and like create
its own zip code it's painful when that
happens when I feel it coming I just
take this which is my Mario buhdeuce go
this is the drying lotion I take this on
a q-tip and I just dot it on there and I
swear boom the next day it's like what
like I murdered it you know uh I've been
using this stuff for a long time as well
I think it's been in my other skincare
videos I've never found a spot treatment
that works better than this
technically they say that you're
supposed to use this after you've
already attacked the pimple but I'm not
no I I do it right away before I even
let it get to the point of attack you
know I just take it down one shot this
stuff works so good so I get this at
Ulta comes in a little bottle like this
and it has a clear fluid on the top and
like a pink sediment on the bottom so
all you do is you want to make sure that
they stay separated like this you take a
q-tip and you dip it down through the
clear fluid into the pink sediment and
then you take whatever is on the q-tip
and you just pop it on any spots that
you want to get rid of and boom like
trust me guys this stuff is powerful
it's worked on a lot of people I've
recommended it to a lot of people and
they all love it
so best spot treatment that I've found
and and I gained so that's that my last
skincare product oh my god this video is
probably so long and so boring the last
skincare product that I use is my face
mask and this is my favorite face mask
as you guys know there are different
face masks that I try here and there
snapchat I'm always trying new skincare
but these have all been Holy Grail
things with me so I just want you to
know that these are all like Ryder diet
type of skin products except for the oil
which I just started using but um this
is my face mask that I've been using
I've gone through a couple jars of this
which is kind of a lot because it's a
face mask and the stuff is a little bit
expensive this is the glam glow super
mud clearing treatment I've mentioned
this in a video before as well so it can
get kind of redundant but this face mask
is the best face mask I've ever tried
it's actually so interesting because
when you apply this to your face it's a
mud it's a mud base mask it like dries
and then you could see all the
disgustingness of your skin like just
coming out like little black dots this
is so gross but it's like kind of
intriguing you know it's kind of like
interesting you can see really where you
have stuff that shouldn't be in your
skin in your skin once this mask dries
it like sucks it all out and I
appreciate that it does that because
then I feel like wow it's actually
working and I can see what's going on
with my skin and where I have larger
pores and where I may have more problem
areas which a lot of people have like
around their nose that's where it gets
real crazy so I really love this mask
it's the best mask on the market if you
ask me I think it's just amazing all
right guys so that is it that's
everything for my skincare video
congratulations if you made it all the
way through this video I'm sure it's
very long and talky but I hope that you
find some products here that really are
useful for you so I really hope that you
