for today's tutorial we're going to be
doing this look here this is 100% cool
tones are you guys excited for me are
you proud of me
I did only cool tones today didn't do
any warm tones whatsoever and I'm
actually using the new Urban Decay a
smokey eye palette this one has a lot
more dramatic shades so I was happy to
play with a little bit more of the
darker smokier tones even though I still
kept it fairly soft I really liked it so
if you guys are interested in this
makeup look then go ahead and keep on
watching first I'm going in with my
L'Oreal Pro matte 2 foundation you guys
know this is my favorite I am in the
shade 108 and I only like to apply this
using a damp Beauty Blender I find that
if I apply it any other way it looks not
as good I'm just going to go ahead and
stipple this all over
I used my cover effects illuminating
primer before I applied this also next
we're going to use Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot this is a cream shadow that's going
to act as my eyeshadow base cancels out
all my redness on my lid
I only use a thin layer of this also you
don't to use too much because it'll cake
up on you for this tutorial I'll be
using the brand new Urban Decay smoky
palette
I think I'm going to be sticking in the
more gray brown tones of this palette
and to set my eyeshadow base I'm going
into the lightest color in the palette
which is this one over here so we're
just going to run that all over the eyes
I'm going to be using the fluffy brush
that came in with the palette that came
in that comes with the palette hey
I'm just going to run that light color
all over just to set my base I'm also
going to use this just to highlight the
brow bone here too so concentrate a lot
of that white in this brow bone area I'm
going to go in with the lid color first
today and I'm using the shade combat
which is this kind of a dusty mauve a
pink shade now with the Mac 217 I'm
going to pick up the shade password here
it's a grayish study color totally lied
you guys I'm not using a Mac 17 I'm
going to use the makeup geek defined
crease brush instead so we're going to
take this and kind of create an outer V
with the shadow I'm going and really
light just to map out the shape first
and then I'm going to take it into the
crease just in like a v-shape
now I kind of have a rough shape and I'm
just going to keep building on that
color with the same brush I really
really like this brush it's one of
makeup geeks new brushes it's perfect to
define little areas like this when you
define this area you really want to put
the point of the brush into the crease
socket and push down like see how it's
pushing down like this and once you
swish this way it's going to focus most
of the product into the crease but then
the bristles that are pushing against
the upper crease area are blending it
out at the same time so now you can see
we really have that defined outer V area
it's nice and smoky so that is it for
the shadow now I'm going to go ahead and
finish off my concealer that way we can
do the lower lash line so are if you
hear my dog for concealer I'm going to
be taking this new one by dior this is
called your star concealer and it is a
sculpting and brightening concealer I
picked up a shade that's really close to
my actual
complexion color I picked up a shade
that's actually really close to my
complexion color this is the shade
0:03 so this is really good for covering
any under-eye darkness it has a bit of a
correcting tone it's more like a salmony
color so I'm going to take this and
really just define this outer shape here
want it to be really sharp and then
taking my Beauty Blender I'm just going
to go ahead and blend that in and then
if you don't want to have like a super
sharp line here you can always take a
clean or semi clean in my case blending
brush and just kind of diffuse it a bit
that way it doesn't look just like a
harsh line now to set our concealer I'm
going to be using the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and I'm going to dip
into that with my Beauty Blender I'm
going to pack this on kind of heavily
but then we're going to dust it away
later
it's called baking or cooking I never
know it's baking or cooking is it both
we're just gonna let this chill for a
little bit okay so what this is going to
do by letting it sit while we do our
contour is it's just gonna really bake
into the skin and highlight the under
eye it's also going to set it so it does
increase as much and I'm going to move
on to my bronzer this is the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer in the shade
deep tan and I'm going to apply this
using the Mac 168 brush
once you apply your bronzer you can
actually even apply a little bit more of
that translucent powder right underneath
the contour and this is also going to do
the same thing it's just going to
sharpen up your contour a bit to make
sure that powder doesn't get in your ear
because I've left it there one time
before and I was at an event with like
white powder in my ear na q since we are
here I'm just going to go ahead and
finish off the face makeup oh baby
here's applying the bronzer on the
perimeters of the face I'm going to pick
up this Mac 137 brush it's very very
fluffy and with this I'm going to just
dust away all the excess powder so we
can stop looking crazy alright next I'm
going to do a little bit of contouring
using the same Mac brush and the Anasazi
Beverly Hills contour kit I'm just going
to pick a tiny bit of that up contour my
cheekbones
for my blush I'm going to use Mac's
pinch meet
from a highlighter today I'm going to
try this one is by Laura Geller this
isn't the shade gilded honey
okay okay so I'm putting that of course
on the cheekbones right here on the tops
of the brow bone or so I'm going to put
a little of that on the tip of the nose
and I'm going to put it on the Cupid's
bow also so we're going to finish off
the eyes now that we finished the face
I'm going to go back into the urban
decay smoke this smoky or smoked smoky
going back into the ballot I'm going to
pick up the brown and the gray this is
whiskey and password and I'm going to
use my honest hacia Beverly Hills little
brush that comes in the palette and I'm
going to smoke out the lower lash line
are you guys proud of me that I'm using
cool tones if anyone gonna say anything
to open up the eyes a little bit I'm
using my NARS pencil and this is in the
shade rue Bonaparte with an angled brush
and the shade black market which is this
one right here I'm going to just really
really line right under that eyeliner
just to make it pop a little bit more
just gonna define the lashline a little
bit with it
I'm just popping this on just the outer
portion of the lower lash line I'm going
to just mix a combination of 13 and high
which is a very high shimmer color and
I'm going to pop these into the inner
corners of my eyes to just bring a
highlight right of a heel and lastly for
the eyes I'm just going to put on some
false lashes so first I'm going to give
my lashes a curl apply some roller lash
mascara and today I'm going to be using
the ardell demi wispies they're a little
bit more natural gonna go ahead and do
that really quick off-camera because you
guys see me do this all the time for the
lips I'm going to be using one of the
new shades from the Anastasio Beverly
Hills liquid lipsticks this is sepia
it's like a brownish sepia tone so good
at explaining colors oh my god
lastly I'm going to give my face a nice
setting with the Mac prep and prime this
is the cucumber scent smells divine so
once you've done that that is the final
step of the makeup look so that is it
