today's video is going to be a makeup
tutorial inspired by Valentine's Day
don't really know I have planned for
Valentine's Day do I have plans I don't
know we'll see I wanted to do a makeup
look for you guys that was a little bit
more dramatic even though it's a little
bit more on the dramatic side I feel
like it's still super feminine I love
this dark lip it just became my new
favorite Bambi lips I used a lot of new
products the tones are all Valentine's
Day tone so it tanks some Purple's
magenta I really love how it turned out
so if you guys are interested than keep
on watching so I'm actually going to
start by picking up a matte blush shade
that's a nice light pink color like this
one right here for my Oprah palette this
is a sigma duo fiber blending brush I'm
going to start lightly mapping out the
shape of my winged out shadow I'm going
really lightly because to be honest
winged out I shadow intimidates me a
little bit sometimes so I'm using just
do a fiber because it's going to apply a
nice light amount product as well it's
not going to be too crazy right off the
bat slowly bringing that inwards towards
the inner part of the eye
alright so now I'm just actually putting
brushes now that I did the outer part
it's just a Smith 235 and I'm going to
carry that blush shade into the inner
corner and kind of diffuse the edges
well we want this to be a nice soft
crease for now who knows where the
makeup will take us I'm just going to
define the outer corner a little bit
more next I'm picking up one of color
pops knew what press shadows this is
stay golden kind of a strange name for
not a golden color so nice magenta I'm
taking that a little more feet a 36 and
again I'm going to define that shape but
take it a little bit lower into the
crease this time use a nice small brush
that you have more
roll over and then you could use a
blending brush to blend it out I'm just
lightly bringing this in and slightly
under the pink shade that we apply it
first don't worry if you get any on your
lid can clean it up Selita
going back into my Smith to 3/5 and I'm
going to start to bust those edges out I
really like these color pop pressed
shadows so far so like they're really
nice and pigmentation they're affordable
and the maps are impressively blendable
like to pick up a clean blending brush
and then kind of discuss the edges
without any product that way you keeps
your eyeshadow from getting all muddy
and then I'm going to go back in one
more time a little bit more eye shadow
and deepen it so a little bit more take
the duo-fiber blending brush that I used
for the pink shade the first one you use
and I'm just going to just use the edges
a little bit and this isn't going to
disrupt too much of the pigmentation
it's just going to blend the edges right
where you clip the bristles so it's nice
you can always clean up the bottom part
at the end with your concealer so don't
worry about that
boom what is the other I know 5 years
later so now we're taking cute alerts
and this is also by color pop it's a
nice plummy shade I'm basically going to
do the same thing and then just deepen
out the outer corner even more with this
using the same brush and this will be
the lowest so closest to the crease it's
okay if you get it like I said on the
lid we're going to cover it anyways but
you know Here I am fixing it because I'm
a perfectionist why it takes me so long
to do things because every little thing
bothers me to clean up the lid I'm going
to take a little bit of my chart shake
tape and medium on the back of my hand
take a flat concealer brush then go over
and kind of clean up and this is also
going to give us a nice space to work
with again don't have to carve it out
perfectly because you know we're going
to cover it we're going to be using this
Stila rose gold retro liquid metal
magnificent - metallic what is it called
magnificent metal putting it on the back
of my hand so I have more control and
I'm an upside
with a concealer brush my technique with
this I think is to first do a light
layer of it and then slowly build it up
at a serious business here I just kind
of put one layer and then another layer
it looks pretty good I have a little bit
of fallout but it's okay because we'll
do our foundation and clean it up I'm
just going to take a dark brown
eyeshadow I'm picking up an expresso
from the lorac Pro palette kind of do a
wing in a way but with eye shadow and
smoke it in towards the inner corner but
just keep it mostly on the outer part of
the eye and then work it into the lash
line if you're like a smoked out shadow
is like very sexy and sultry it just
keeps the eye very smoky now I'm going
to just apply a little bit of
Maybelline's bigshot mascara to my
lashes just a little quick base coat for
my falsies so that they don't you know
six straight oh okay so for my lashes
I'll be using the iconic light these
will be out February 19th so they're
basically the same thing as our new
original iconic they just made them less
dense and the band is way thinner
they're really really nice so I'm just
going to apply these I know there's a
mini version but those are just as dense
they're just shorter and link these are
actually the same length as the original
iconic they're just less dense boom that
really opens up the eyes so now we're
going to move on to the face before we
finish the eyes I'm going to be using my
Giorgio osmani luminous silk foundation
this is in 7.5 I had to order another
one because mine's out it have it in
store so they gave me a little bit of a
sample because you know I needed it
blended out with my Beauty Blender
when at that time of the month I feel
like I need a few hairs foundation for
some reason like Jennifer's body when
she sits almost foundation she's like
what I got going on right now watching
the new foundation in this video but you
know what I tried using the Knicks lon
and to be honest if you guys it just did
not work for me and I wanted it so badly
to work for me it's just like the
coloring was so yellow or so pink I
couldn't figure out the right color and
then it just kind of looked kind of
crusty around my dry areas you know
typically you would want to bring this
down your neck as well but like I ain't
really going anywhere after this so I
don't want to waste I actually don't
have a nice foundation left over to do
that so we're just going to move on and
pretend like a seamless blend is
happening here now moving on to
concealer I'll be using the Becca aqua
luminous and medium first so I like this
one under the eyes because it's really
hydrating and it doesn't look you cakey
I like to kind of apply this one closest
to the under eye area this one is just
so luminous so it's not going to be all
crusty under my under eye and I'm a
little tired and dry I noticed since
coming back from Aspen my eyelids and my
under eyes are really just shriveled up
little scrotum so I'm trying to keep
them and rehydrated for the more hollow
areas around here I like to use the
sharp sharp tart shape tape not sharp
and I put this like right around here
and also on the sides of the nose to
slim it out boom this is also really
good to contour or not contour but
highlight your nose so if you put a
straight line on the nose area it's
gonna highlight and make your nose look
straight if it's not and then bring it
up forehead because we have a natural
highlight there as well that's why your
face doesn't look flat all one color you
want to have light and dark areas here
so now I'm taking my Beauty Blender and
I'm going to blend out to that concealer
and I'm not going to take it all the way
up to my under eye lines because like I
said this one is a little bit more heavy
duty and it sets really matte so if
you're more dry you
want to try to avoid those areas I blend
out the line of the nose laughs because
the concealer kind of has more time to
dry when you leave it on and so the
straight line is going to be more
defined when I try to blend it out going
to blend out just enough but not move
around too much concealer just really
brings everything to life awesome
remember when I film that if he just
would be like after the concealer and
you see like wow that really works and
I'm like I can say it you can't say it
so next I'm going to go ahead and
lightly set that with my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and I've recently
been mixing it with a little bit of Kat
Von D lock-it brightening powder and
golden this is super brightening and not
that I you know you don't have to mix
them you can use one or the other but
it's just like the little cocktail that
Ivan's making mine I just just tiny bit
in each and then mix it up my little lab
here the golden is just really really
brightening which is good we like that
but if I use just that I feel like it
can almost be too brightening so I like
to mix those two together and I applied
such a light amount that I'm not
actually baking I'm just pressing it
lightly into the under eyes and I'm
gonna leave it like that don't forget to
put the translucent powder into your
cheeks like where you have more pores
because I swear
makes it look nicer smoother blurs it
now I'm also going to take that mixture
that I have in the cap and I'm going to
do the line down the nose here we'll let
that sit for a second I'm going to go
ahead and test out a new bronzer today
on camera never used it before this what
it looks like and it's the collab with
Alexis Wren I don't know if you guys
watched like Jay Alvarez videos I used
to be like a thing they have a lot of
videos together that's how I knew who
she was really really pretty
so to my trusty Mac 1 3 5 this one
disperses it a little bit more forgiving
this color is OK for me
it's a little bit too rosy I guess as a
bronzer for me I think I'm just going to
switch it out with our lane or lon
bronzer oh three yeah because it looked
a little rosy actually I'm just going to
do a light bronze don't want too much
bronzer I guess and though I already
went crazy on the bronzer swim out the
jaw line I've been like trying not to
use Mac give me Sun recently I know
shocker
you know how my breakouts all happened
in my contour lines so the only thing I
can think of it I use there all the time
is that I've been using it forever
though and it never used to do that to
me so I'm really like fighting the fact
that that would be it but I'm just
testing but I really hope it's not that
you know I just for shits and it'll I'm
going to test out this highlight as well
because it is a little bit more of a
bronzey highlight even though I have
another highlight in mind that I want to
use it for this little short drive so it
is a little bit more gold and this is
the color pop one I feel like this is a
really good like a light dusting
highlight for a sunkissed glow
not so much for like a BAM in your face
glow unless you have a deeper skin tone
then I think this might show up this
will kind of wanted to test it real
quick on camera I like it but it's a
little bit more for a bronzy look and I
want to do something more in this range
of colors like these pinky tones and
this is the Milani afterglow strobe
light and this is an O one who's also
new for me so hey girls
we're just going to put this on the tops
of the cheekbones this is more in the
realm of colors that I was going for and
just or you play my highlights on my
Cupid's bow and that's just like
actually somewhere here trying new
product I'm going to try also from
Milani
the nose contour this is a contour and
highlight cream and liquid duo I'm a
little bit obsessed that I put powder on
my nose already because this is a cream
product but let's do it anywhere why not
this is an o2 medium let's try this Real
Techniques shading brush tried this
earlier without foundation and I really
liked it I feel like it's so easy to
apply to the sides of the nose and it's
nice ended ashy undertone so you're not
going to look super orange on the sides
and it blends out pretty good ideally
you would want to do this before you put
powder on your nose but here we are so I
think I made a major mistake of putting
this over powder because without powder
underneath it like blends a lot easier
obviously those my bad but you know I'm
also gonna use the highlighting side and
put it down the center of the nose as
well so it's good use my Beauty Blender
to pass that in lightly for my blush I'm
going to use the same color that I used
in my crease and this is going to tie
all the tones together go in with a Mac
129 brush sheer and I'm going to apply
it a little bit higher right between my
highlight and my bronzer I'm going over
everything all the edges of my blush and
stuff with my Beauty Blender so it looks
a little bit more blended go ahead and
finish off the eyes so going back into
that blush color again I'm taking that
under the lash line and we're going to
go ahead and skip the more maroon colors
apply a little bit of the blush and
really blend it out nicely have another
brush with nothing on it right here and
I just kind of diffuse those edges even
more under the eyes I'm going to go
ahead and take the highbrow this is by
benefit and I actually love this to warm
it up on the back of my hand first and
then I put it on the waterline it's
going to brighten up the under eyes and
then go back in with that brush that we
have the pink and we're gonna just blend
it out to blend it out we can be all
done
hey como Luna does okay so like I said
I'm not going to put the reddish maroon
color so don't want to get too sticky
nothing down there so I'm taking the
same dark brown which is this one that I
used espresso to do the wing and that's
the one that we're going to apply on the
outer part of our lower lash line nice
if you apply it right under that
highbrow that we put in the waterline
it's going to make it pop even on work
and we're just going to connect it to
that wing that we did earlier by the
time we're done blending this Brown out
you won't even be able to see the pink
as much it's just going to be a nice
halo under the eye so it's not as like a
pink under eyes next I'm going to be
highlighting my inner corner and for
sure I have to use the photograph
highlight because it's just so pretty
and it's so pink anytime I do like pink
eye shadows I love using this as an
inner corner highlight because it pops
like crazy
finally I'm going to do this list
because I just fell in love with it
today this is the Stila
all-day stain like with a stick in haha
say this name and ot te note not make it
to just oh yeah give it summer this
color is actually life honestly let me
