lipstick on my teeth okay we're good for
today's video I'm going to be doing a
makeup - I thought I would give you guys
another New Year's Eve idea if you have
some phenomenal plans I don't have plans
yet but hopefully something just pops up
the last makeup look I did was more of
like a super glittery bright red lip
look for this makeup look I thought I
would do something that was a little bit
more I mean it's definitely not toned
down but not as much chunky glitter more
of like a reflex glitter and when i zoom
in you'll see on the eyes it's super
pretty when the light hits it I did a
rose gold eye with a vampy lip that was
actually an idea that one of you guys
gave me I went on snapchat I asked you
guys what you wanted to see and somebody
said a rose gold eye look and I agreed
and I really really loved how it turned
out I especially love this lip color
it's like so vampy so dark and so matte
it looks like velvety and for this video
I teamed up with MAC Cosmetics so all
the products are from there it was kind
of like nostalgic using things that I
used to always use like you know I had a
dip and brown script this used to be
like my all-time must use eyeshadow in
every single makeup look when I started
posting on Instagram it was like always
in my captions so let's go ahead and get
started with this video first thing I'm
going to do is apply my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot as an eyeshadow base all over
the lid I love the space when I want
like you know an intense makeup look
makes everything more vibrant and I like
to apply it with a buffing brush make
sure that it lays down really smoothly
I'm just applying my Blanc type to set
the eyeshadow base this is something I
always do into the crease and then
whatever's left over I lightly dusted
over the lid but not too much because
you don't want to mattify the lid if
you're gonna add shimmery eyeshadows I
can't believe it's gonna be a new year
already time goes by so fast everybody
says that but as you get older and
really just go by a lot quicker
alright so now I'm picking up soft Brown
and I'm gonna
apply that into my crease kind of like
my upper crease area I like to tilt my
head back a little bit it's that way you
could see like right where your socket
is just gonna fly up in the air soft
Brown used to be my jam back in the day
also Brown script woof you couldn't get
me caught up without Brown script in the
crease I'm going in with honey lust this
is one of my favorite eyeshadows because
it has like it's like a gold but it's
more rose gold and it's just really
sparkly so I'm gonna use my finger and
apply that all over the lid
it's basically rose gold is what it is
it's so pretty you know what I like to
do also I like to wet a flat brush with
some fix+ dipping it into honey lust
while the brush is wet because it gives
it a little bit more of like a foiled
look up to the intensity I'm just going
to go ahead and apply that all over the
lid I'm going to try to put this over
top of that this is a dazzle shadow in
slow fast slow it's really reflective
and it has like some rose gold
pinky undertones kind of gives that you
know nice wet look do you see it do you
see what I'm putting down right now
we're going to go in with a little black
gel liner and create a wing so I'm
starting right there at the corner of my
eye and I like to kind of tilt my head
like this not breathe basically I don't
breathe I'm not breathing bring it back
bring it back boom just like that on the
outer part of the eye oh I want to keep
it very cat eye like so I'm trying to
keep the wing just on the outer part of
the eye
oh the second wing was quick the first
one was giving me some issues now I'm
gonna go into my brown script you don't
have to do this step but you know I'm
gonna take it up you could leave your
crease like this and have more of a soft
crease but I'm going to intensify it
just a little bit sometimes I do this
after my wing because I feel like I have
a better vision of where the dark shadow
meets the wing and so it just looks
better it's a lot easier for me because
you know sometimes the ankle of your
wing you go in a different direction
than you planned and your eye shadow is
still going the direction that you
thought your wing was going to go in
your wing is actually the boss of you in
this makeup tutorial it dictates where
everything is going to be so I feel like
this shadow is really going to bring out
like all the rosy gold tones on the lid
and if you get any fallout on your wing
you could just go right over that liner
afterwards I'm just gonna apply a little
bit of mascara I was thinking about
doing the gold glitter but honestly I
felt like this was just so pretty I'm
not sure if I want to add the gold
glitter I feel like it makes it look
less rose gold if you guys want to add
glitter you can there's a lot of looks
with gold glitter so I just felt like
this was a little bit prettier without
the gold the reflex look even more
sparkly in person from that eye shadow I
used and they give off more of a pink
tone which I like so I'm just going to
keep it like this
my last look that I did was super
glittery if you guys want to check that
out and I'm using the upward lash
mascara go ahead and put on some falsies
if you're into that kind of thing gotta
get some of this fall out out of here
good picking up some of the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer and I'm gonna go
ahead and conceal the under eyes I used
to warm this color but I think this is
when I was like really into highlighting
because I don't use this light of a
concealer anymore this is NC 25 I
probably could have gone with like a
shade darker but this is what I used to
use all the time this color I'm gonna
try to use more like natural concealer
shades now color wise
alright you can go ahead and set your
under-eyes we're going to go right back
into brown script and smoke that on our
lower lash line one time I always smoke
out my lower lash line I feel like it
just helps me because I have no
eyelashes to like bring some something
to the bottom of my lashes
it also helps disguise creasing what do
you guys have planned for the New Year's
huh any exciting plans out there any
cool parties I wish like you know what I
find interesting is that like nobody
throws masquerade party I don't think
I've ever been to like um like a brand
masquerade party I feel like that would
have been fun even just to throw for all
your friends and stuff I'm gonna attempt
to add mascara to my lower lashes let's
just see let's see what happens there's
one lash I do like this one because it's
tiny it's made for ants there's a little
something going on here so now I'm going
to go in and bronze up my skin using my
Mac give me Sun when you have a pimple
on your bronzer line like this you have
to be very careful with the way you
apply your product so that you don't
move your foundation underneath I'm
gonna use a little bit of my studio fix
actually cuz you know we got to cover
that breakout out it's not like that big
of a deal but just to make sure that it
doesn't try to make an appearance later
in the night I have another one on this
side I think it's honestly I think it's
my phone
I don't even talk on my phone really
like up to my face but I feel like I put
it on speakerphone and then I put my
phone right here and it has a little
hand it reaches out like it's just like
and touches my face I swear because I
know I'm not doing it so and I'm
cleaning my brushes every day so I don't
know right over top of that powder
foundation I'm going to take the give me
Sun and you know glow it up
bronze up your whole face not just your
cheekbones God I've been using that give
me Sun for so long like I want I always
wonder if I'll ever start using another
bronzer they should just name it give it
to me by desi right let's get that
jawline popping as well I have to make
sure like just penetrates into my skin
so that's why I'm really going in we
have a party to go to after this or a
dinner kind of down to the wire right
now I would say perfect timing actually
I would say that I'm gonna be on time I
wonder if I'll be there before Katie
boom tain't oh you know what I'm using
the NC 45 powder foundation to lightly
contour my nose so my nose likes to go
like this way a little bit like it has a
little so I've got a contour it down to
give it the illusion of being straight
it's not like super crooked or anything
but you know see that there was like a
bump a hump here but if I put contour
over it contour powder over it it
strains it out
the illusion just going to make sure to
really blend it out afterwards
moving on to highlighting keeping with
these like rosy gold tones I'm going to
use beaming blush this is a mineralized
skinfinish just put that on the high
points mmm-hmm also gonna put that you
know in the usual spots tip of the nose
and a little bit down the bridge but not
not too crazy just like a little I'm
also going to use that in the inner
corners of my eyes for blush I'm going
to be using stay pretty this is one of
my favorite shades I also really love
peachy peaches or peachy keen so for my
lip I wanted to do something vampy just
because my last look was bright red and
I always do nude look so I wanted to do
a rose gold with a vampy dark lip this
is uniform
fabulous and I'm going to line my lips
first with night moth this is kind of
like my go-to when I do a vampy lip
so when I do a dark lip I always like to
use the lip liner that I'm lining my
lips with to fill in my whole lip
because it's such a hard pencil that is
just going to like make your lipstick
last a lot longer and if your lipstick
on top happens to fade away it's like
this stays on so for my lip color I'm
going to be using the retro matte liquid
lip and this is in the shade uniformly
fabulous just so vampy I love it I love
how dark it is it goes perfect with
night moth I love this makeup look with
this this lip and this I mix together
kinda is giving me like Rihanna vibes
sometimes after you apply your lip and
you look at your overall face you have
to really like think if everything is
balanced and I definitely need more
bronzer alright this is the finished
makeup look rose-gold super clean vampy
