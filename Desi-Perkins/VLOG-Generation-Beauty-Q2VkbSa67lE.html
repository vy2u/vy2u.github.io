excited so did you guys serve it I'm so
nervous
actually I'm speaking on a panel I don't
know what's wrong with me I think I have
like I gets overwhelmed and like so much
anxiety that I just look
hi cameraman hey it's uh Steven what are
you wearing we arrived at Gen beauty and
immediately took pictures on the pink
carpet walking in it was so packed and I
got to meet so many of you guys right
off the bat
there was an awesome setup for a photo
shoot on one of the stages at Gen beauty
and crispy and Kristin Dominique and I
went up and had a mini photo shoot
along with meetings so many of you guys
there was also so many bloggers and
youtubers instagramers that were also
there taking photos and doing panels and
just walking around checking out the
brand
that's why I got to hang out with Judy
from its duties time and I absolutely
loved it because she was so sweet just
as I knew she would be but it was
awesome talking with her and just
hanging out for a bit then it was off to
speak at my panel which was super
nerve-wracking but it ended up being
totally fine and I felt super
comfortable hanging out with you guys
and answering any of your
it's all an illusion I I don't really
dress fashionable every day I'm like in
sweats and then I put this like really
fashionable outfit on take a picture
I absolutely love this couple they are
husband and wife who also do you - we
went and checked out our Del's booth
because they had an awesome photo booth
set up there and it was Nicole Guerrero
krispies and I and macdaddy and made it
into the mix
and that was a successful end to day one
welcome to day to day to Jin you can
ever man okay a Stephen time cameraman
part-time daddy makeup has no full-time
full-time full-time better not be
part-time I have a meeting fee that you
guys have 12 o'clock and I'm really
excited looking away
which side is your side
I am not functional without caffeine
whatsoever so after I drank my coffee I
headed over to do a few interviews and
then krispies and I went outside to
capture view outfit of the day pictures
so that we could keep up with Instagram
day two was a little bit more mellow so
made sure to stop by all of the boots
that were there at gem beauty and check
out all the new makeup and also of
course get free makeup which was awesome
they were giving away a lot of stuff
soon enough it was time for our meet and
greet over at city color where we got to
meet so many of you guys and I can't
even tell you what an amazing feeling it
is to me every single one of you I just
thank you I was so humbled and just
taken aback
after our meet and greet we had a little
dance party with city color which was so
much fun soon after Chris B and I headed
over to an interview with
future daddy actually I just want to say
what does it take the
you know father blogger put your family
your lawyer well you know number one
your family comes first so you know
always consider that picking the moment
Judy always said that to be just savor
every minute and I love them
so after all the craziness at generation
breeding this weekend it was over and
I'm sad to say it was but I enjoy eating
I refill one of you and I cannot thank
you enough for all the support so I love
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
