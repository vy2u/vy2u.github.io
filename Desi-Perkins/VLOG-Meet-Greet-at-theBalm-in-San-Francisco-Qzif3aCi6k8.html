shimmery colors on my lid yeah I'm gonna
go into feisty and funny and start
popping those into my lid these two like

I just let's put some bottom eyelashes
on I'm good to go I went to IMAX one
year and it was like the first time that
people were like oh my god desi and I
never really experienced that feeling
before and I swear I was like so excited
and happy but I think I pretty much like
blocked out like everything was
happening so quickly and like I remember
somebody writing me saying I'm so
disappointed I tried to say hi to you I
Neal I totally ignored me and it made me
feel really sad because that's not what
it was at all it was that I was so
overwhelmed and anxious that like I
didn't I couldn't really focus on
anything at that moment it was the first
time that people were like saying hi to
me so I mean I feel bad that that person
feels that way because that's not who I
am at all but um I don't know man
I never want to make anyone feel that
way because I've had people make me feel
that way before
and I was like wow that sucks cuz I
totally love this person and then they
ended up being like a douche bag you
know I just lost knocked out of all of
you guys at the balm and it's like so
exciting crazy I'm getting nervous now
yeah we can't that looks delicious
so had to step out for a second because
I can honestly say that we did not
expect what has happened tonight
and I just want to say thank you guys

messages desi I'm extremely proud of you

come and how strong you are and how
empowering you are to every single
individual that watches your videos so
