today's tutorial is going to be this
dark lip vampy makeup look you guys all
requested that I do it look like this so
here it is this is what I came up with
just like a really nice brown warm
smokey eye with the smoked out cat wing
lots of eyeliner and of course God have
a dark lip if you guys are interested in
this makeup look then keep on watching
so the first thing I'm going to do is
apply my cover effects illuminating
primer all over my face I like to pop my
primer in next I'm going to be using my
HD foundation by Make Up For Ever this
is the Ultra HD and it's in the shade Y
375 I'm just going to stipple this on
next I'm priming my lids with the
Smashbox 24 hour photo finish shadow
primer
so I'm just going to take a bone colored
shadow you guys could use a translucent
powder also to set the cream I also like
to concentrate most of it on the brow
bone so it kind of highlights my brow
bone I'm going to be taking this color
from the morphe 350 palette and I'm
going to run that across my whole lid
space so I'm going to just kind of
lightly buff that into the crease
next I'm picking up colourpop's shadow
in Central Perk like friends and I'm
using a Smith 302 brush start creating a
wing like we would do with eyeliner but
making it super thick so I'm going to
pick some of that up so this color is a
little bit more red than I would like I
wanted more of a chocolatey deeper Brown
instead I'm going to pick up fudge from
the Anasazi artist couture palette
continue building up that fudge color I
actually switched brushes to a little
bit more of a fluffier brush this is the
Smith 2 5 3 and it's okay if you get
fallout because we have not applied our
concealer yet going back into the
synthetic angled brush it's kind of an
angled brush I'm gonna create my wing
with the eye shadow we're gonna go over
this with black later but this is just
to have like a smoked out cat eye type
of look
back into the fluffy brush with a little
bit of Morocco from Anastacio Beverly
Hills reddish brown shade when I take
that and run it along the edges of the
liner shadow that we did
basically just want to gradiate the eye
from a dark-brown to then like former
brown and then the light color that we
laid down on the lid is our base tilt my
head back so that I could see where I
need to blend a little bit more wind
just went ahead and connected with my
eyebrow which happens from time to time
next I'm taking some black eyeshadow
from the palette and I'm gonna follow
the wing but just keep it closer to the
base this time
and I want to take this really like into
the inner corner to kind of feline it
out
you want to just kind of make soft
strokes along the edges of the black
shadow so that it fades into the brown
I'm going to go ahead and take a makeup
remover wipe and clean up all this eye
shadow fall out that we have here which
is a lot
so next I'm going to go over that and
create a deeper wing with this black
liner from Inglot and the Smith brush
202 much covered all the black that I
did so I did that so now that we're done
with the eyeliner I'm going to go in
with my eye concealer just to clean up
the under eye I'm using the Tarte
creaseless concealer one is in the shade
tan and one is in medium sand but on the
V then of course I'm taking my Beauty
Blender and I'm going to blend that out
so I'm going to go ahead and set that
with my Laura Mercier translucent powder
I'm just going to go ahead and take a
brush and dust away all of that excess
loose powder I'm going to be taking the
dark brown and Morocco and running them
underneath the lash line
next I'm going to take the gel liner and
I'm actually going to put this in the
water line right here so you don't see
the water line in this whole outer area
as I get closer to the inner part of the
eye I'm just going to try to kind of
like fade it out so just like it's
thinner in the inner part now I'm going
to put some mascara on this is the Tarte
lights camera lashes for lashes I'm
going to be using these right here and
these are flutter lashes in the style
Ashley
Bosh's make a huge difference in the eye
makeup for sure we're gonna bronze up
our skin this is Matt give me son
obviously I'm just gonna take this
around my hairline
oh yeah I'm using a Mac 135 I love this
brush because it's so large so it's
really nice for adding bronzer all over
the face go ahead and highlight and
highlight I'm using honest Asti Beverly
Hills so Hollywood and a Smith 112 brush
Rory laughing
whoo also gonna highlight the bridge of
my nose
very
you
for blush I'm going to use hot make up
and this is in the shade wonder lust one
of my faves
for my lips I'm going to be doing a dark
event lips under you guys want that so
this is max night Mach which is one of
my favorite dark lip liners so first
gonna use this all around my mouth
all right so I'm just taking a lip brush
and kind of blending that liner out I'm
working it into the lip so I have a dark
stain on my lips that way the dark color
lasts really long and if your lipstick
happens to bleed away it's fine because
you'll have this underneath as a base
for the lips I'm using the liquid
lipstick by hot makeup and this is the
shade midnight
so I'm gonna actually pick up midnight
this is also called midnight but it's a
darker I think it's black bio Nastasia
Beverly Hills and I'm gonna pick you
yeah it's black I'm gonna take my lip
brush and use a little bit of that just
to make the color a little darker all
right and this is the lips done they're
super dark super vampy don't be scared
to wear a dark lip it's just makeup I
know a lot of people say that they can't
wear a dark lip and sometimes I feel
that way too good I wear it anyway cuz I
