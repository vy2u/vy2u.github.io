for today's tutorial we're gonna be
doing this makeup look right here I've
been obsessed with this dark lip I've
been wearing it like all the time on
snapchat on Instagram everywhere and I
wanted to do a look based around it also
a lot of you guys have been asking me
for this Rihanna makeup look that's so
similar and I've actually done a lot of
makeup looks that looked just like this
eye it's kind of like my go-to eye so I
wanted to change it up a little bit and
use a little bit more of like greyish
cool tones still keeping slight warmth
in the crease so if you guys are
interested in my take on this look then
keep watching um my eyebrows are kind of
intense today but I'm gonna do an
intense makeup so that's why they look
crazy right now cuz I don't have any
other makeup on just wanted to put that
out there before you guys are like
what's happening to your eyebrows so the
first thing I'm gonna do is put my
foundation on I'm using the Mac face and
body foundation in the shade c5 today I
kind of want it to be full covered so
I'm gonna build it up this foundation is
great a lot of people use it on
photoshoots because it's waterproof you
can make it light coverage or heavy
coverage so I'm gonna start building it
up and I'm using this because I do want
my skin to be really glowy today
especially because I am sick so I need a
little bit of healthy glow
I feel like if I use a matte foundation
I'll look like really dry and tired I'm
just applying it with a Beauty Blender
and I'm gonna be layering it up alright
so now you guys can see that it gave me
more of like a dewy finish now I'm gonna
go in with my concealer before I use any
powders this is the Maybelline instant
age rewind I've been using this lately
this one is in the shade neutralizer I
think that this concealer is actually
getting a little too light for me know
that I've gotten more tan so I may have
to pick up another color I'm also gonna
highlight with this so I'm gonna put it
like at the tip of my nose right here in
the center of my forehead and then I'm
much in I'm using my Real Techniques
brush and I'm just gonna pop that in it
has a little bit of that foundation on
it so it's gonna kind of blend it in a
little bit better
darnit up a little bit but I do really
want a strong highlight because this
look is kind of intense altogether I'm
gonna with my Beauty Blender actually
when you use a Beauty Blender it'll pick
up all the excess products so you don't
just have globs of product left over on
the skin okay so to set the under-eye I
am going to use my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and I'm gonna bake
today basically what that is is you take
a loose powder and I just I'm going to
dip my Beauty Blender in it and you're
gonna just pack the powder under the
eyes what that's gonna do is really set
the concealer and it's also going to
brighten the under-eye it's gonna make
it not crease as quickly so I'm just
taking a little bit of this and setting
it here I also like to send it along the
sides of my nose because there's a
shadow there that makes my nose look
like wider and when you put light there
it'll take away that shadow okay so
since I used such a lightweight dewy
foundation I want to set it with
something a little bit full coverage
this is the Mac Studio Fix foundation in
NC 43 and it's pretty tan also so I'm
gonna swirl a fluffy brush in it and
just kind of set the whole face with
this it's gonna give us a little bit
more coverage and make our face a tiny
bit more matte but not too matte alright
so after you set the whole face then you
can just go ahead and wipe away the
under-eye powder I'm using an elf blush
brush to do this next I'm gonna go in
with my bronzer this is my matte give me
Sun and I'm just gonna use this as kind
of like an all-over face warmer even
though I'm already pretty tan this is
gonna be a transition shade for our
contour so I'm just gonna kind of go in
and lightly place this where I'm going
to place my contour but just slightly
above it something to use a new contour
kit today this is the my sculpted face
by a cosmetics I just got this over the
week of Gen View D so I really wanted to
try it out I'm gonna use my zoeva this
is the luxe highlight brush just has
like a pointed tip I'm gonna take a
little bit of my Studio Fix powder just
the same powder I used to set my face
and contour my nose slightly
and then right down the bridge of my
nose I'm gonna highlight and I had the
highlight color in that palette is a
little bit really like white so I'm just
gonna use the banana from Anastacio
Beverly Hills with the same brush and
just kind of go down the center so by
adding the light down the bridge it's
gonna also give the illusion of like
perfectly straight to the surface and
it's gonna highlight just like where you
want the nose to be so for the highlight
I'm really excited because I'm using the
new highlighter from Anastasia Beverly
Hills this is called so Hollywood it's
just like beaming out of the palate
already so I'm pretty excited about this
I'm gonna apply it using the Sigma soft
blend concealer brush oh my god I've
arrived
alright I'm also gonna take a little bit
of that highlighter right on the tip of
my nose and the bridge slightly just at
the top here and then the Cupid's bow
for my blush I am using Mac's ambering
rose I'm just gonna use that same elf
blush brush to apply that and then to
kind of just set everything since we did
apply a lot of product I'm using my mac
fix+
I'm just gonna spray that especially on
the highlights of my face if you tend to
get really oily you don't want to spray
this all over it just spray it on these
sides and you just want to let that dry
it's gonna kind of make the highlight
look less powdery and more dewy when you
do that so now I'm moving on to the eyes
I want to clean up my brows a little bit
just because they're a little bit of
stray hairs so I'm using some concealer
and a small concealer brush and I'm just
going to kind of carve out the lower
part of the brow first I'm gonna take a
morphe 14 and just blend that down so
that you don't notice have like this
white line across your brow and then for
my eye shadow base of course I'm using
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and I'm using
that same morphe brush I'm just gonna
apply that to the lid and blend it out
and of course after you apply a cream
base it's always good to set it with an
eye shadow or even the translucent
powder that we have here the Laura
Mercier powder that I used to under my
eyes I could even use that which is what
I'm gonna use right now
just something powder so that when we
put the powder eyeshadows on top it
glides a lot easier and it won't get
stuck to any creamy patchy parts so I'm
going into my meat matte nude by the
balm cosmetics and I'm picking up Matt
rose
onto a Mac 217 brush and I'm gonna apply
this into the upper crease area also
like an outer V type shape just kind of
wing it out so next I'm going in with
Auto Stassi at Beverly Hills dusty rose
and a Mac to 1/3 and I'm going to
pinpoint this into the crease more so
this is gonna give us just like a slight
purple undertone like a gray purple
which is what we want just blend it out
it's okay if it gets in the lid - it's
not that big of a deal
just gonna blend it all together all
right now I'm gonna really deepen that
up using the matte wood mixed with Matt
Garcia here which is more of a Reddy
Brown and this is more of a gray Brown
I'm just gonna mix the two on the same
brush and really deepen up the crease so
I'm using actually more of the map wood
because it has more of like a cool
undertone and I want to keep the crease
a little bit cool in the darker colors
okay so far the lid I'm going to use
this color pop eyeshadow it's from their
new collection this is called gecko it's
kind of like a light gray with flecks of
I don't know you'll see so I'm just
gonna apply this to the lid with a
concealer brush just kind of looks
pretty pretty light but I'm gonna put a
highlight over it I'm gonna use this to
just also clean up the crease right here
just to sharpen it up and then on top of
that I'm applying the makeup forever
highlight I've been using this on the
lid lately and I love it it's the number
one which is the more pinky undertone
and this is gonna give it more of a
sparkle I love this highlight I'm not
gonna bring this up all the way to the
top though because I don't want it to
get into my crease color so I'm keeping
it low I'm also gonna bring that into
the inner corner of the eye so I'm gonna
try to do my eyeliner to like
nikkietutorials does I don't know how
she does it with this eyeliner but I'm
gonna try this is the trooper Kat Von D
eyeliner pencil so I'm gonna try this
method hopefully
I'll mess up everything right now first
I think she just creates the wing with
this alright alright and then she uses
the NYC liquid liner to fill it in so
I'm a cop EU Nicky because your eyeliner
looks fierce it's actually a very smart
technique it's like a really fast way to
make a wing I don't know how that
happened so quickly
alright so my wing got a little higher
than anticipated but it's okay but
basically at my eyebrow you guys don't
have to make your wing this thick but
you know it's just one of them days I'm
applying a some quick mascara cuz I'm
gonna just pop on my falsies it's a non
popping on some iconic spy House of
lashes so now that I'm done with the
lashes I'm just gonna do my lower lash
line and I'm gonna go in with the same
colors I used in the crease with this
palette and a little bit of matte hung
because it's slightly purple and I'm
just gonna apply this to the outer part
of the lower lash line and I'm using an
angled brush this is from morphe just so
that I could get a precise line I'm just
going right under the waterline and
topping that in I'm just taking a
blending brush and kind of running it
along the lower lash line to soften that
up and then in the waterline I'm using
the NARS eye pencil this is in rabona
part it's like a flesh toned eyeliner
this is just gonna open up the eyes give
you more of like a doll eye appearance
and then once I've applied that I'm just
gonna apply a little bit of mascara to
my bottom lashes now for the lips I'm
going to do a very bold lip a really
dark lip one of my favorite dark
lipsticks at the moment that I've kind
of been wearing every time I go out I'm
just in love with it it is the hot make
up liquid lipstick this is in midnight
and I'm first gonna apply the NARS night
moth's lipliner with it it's like a dark
lip liner so first line your lips just
makes it a lot easier now that I've
lined my lips and look crazy I'm gonna
apply the liquid lipstick alright guys
