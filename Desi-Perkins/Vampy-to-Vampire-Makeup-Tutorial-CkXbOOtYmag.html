tomorrow is Halloween and for all of you
who don't have a costume yet I decided
to show you how to turn this vampy
makeup look into a vampire makeup look
this is super easy to do and all you
need is all black for your costume you
get thrown some fangs and you're good to
go
so if you like what you see then keep on
watching to start this look off I'm
taking a light orange shade with a large
fluffy brush and applying that into the
crease as my transition shade you guys
can use any warm shadow for this red
also works for a vampire look and then
I'm going to gradiate a dark brown
shadow into the crease right after and
I'm going to direct this more into the
actual socket of my eye and try not to
blend it too far up into the brow bone
and I always like to take a large fluffy
brush and blend the edges after each
step just so it's nice and clean next
you want to take a black eye shadow and
apply that directly into the crease
making sure not to bring this black
shadow up too high if it gets on the lid
it's okay because we're gonna block that
out anyways so I'm just creating a round
shape with this eye shadow and this is
going to make it so that it creates
beautifully from black to brown to that
light orange shade
and taking this all the way into the
tear duct as well to ensure that our lid
stays at dark and black the whole night
you want to make sure to apply some sort
of gel liner or a pencil eyeliner just
to get a nice black base and then just
pack on that black eyeshadow on top of
it so it comes out super dark and it
won't get patchy you throughout the
night and of course like I said take a
blending brush and make sure you're
continuously blending out those edges
you can leave the look like this without
liner but I decided I wanted a fierce
wing so I'm picking up a gel liner and
just lining my eyes as close to my
lashes and then I'm going to create a
pretty dramatic wing with this and
extend it all the way out and I'm going
to build that liner up until I like the
shape and what I like to do after is
take a liquid liner and apply it over
that because it always makes it a little
bit darker and a little bit cleaner to
really sharpen up our wing I'm going to
take a concealer and just carve out the
bottom of the liner and it's going to
make it really nice and clean and then
you want to take a pencil liner and just
really smoke out your lower lash line
with this blend it out because you don't
want a super harsh line and I decided
that I want to take that gel liner and
really make the inner corner of my eye
kind of pointy because it looks more
villainous and I'm just setting that
liner with some black shadow
lastly you want to pop on some falsies
of course and moving on to the face if
you guys have ever purchased a drugstore
foundation that was a little bit too
light for your skintone this is the time
to use it I'm using a super light
foundation just to kind of pale out my
skin so I look more like a vampire and
then of course because vampires have
nice under eyes I'm using concealer just
kidding they don't but I want to use
concealer anyways because I want to be a
pretty vampire next you just want to
make sure to set your makeup with a
translucent powder and then I'm going to
go in with my city color contour effects
palette and I'm going to be picking up
these dark shades mixing them together
to hollow out my face to make it look
more vampy and I really like this
contour palette because it's very highly
pigmented and the consistency of it is
super silky so you just want to pop that
right in the hollows if you suck in your
cheeks it makes it a little bit easier
to see where that would be and I'm also
going to place that in the temples as
well now of course I'm going to contour
my nose using the same two shades
because I always contour my nose because
contouring is fabulous and this is going
to make your nose appear slimmer and
straighter and
next to make my cheekbones look like
they're protruding a little bit more I'm
going to go ahead and pick up the
highlighting shade and just pop that on
the top of the cheekbones now I'm going
to pick up the intense blush quad in
collection 2 and I'm just picking up one
of the shades and lightly applying it
because it is highly pigmented so you
just want to put a little bit on your
brush and then I'm also going to use
that under the eyes to kind of give a
more reddish dead look as well now it's
time for the vampy lip I'm using my city
color lipstick in Marisa and this
lipstick is super matte and it has a
really long wear so it's good for
Halloween and to deepen that even more
I'm taking a dark lip liner and I'm
going to create sort of an hombre effect
and then go back in with the lipstick
just to blend it all out
so I found these really cool vampire
bite temporary tattoos and they're
really easy to apply and quick so I
think it's a really cool idea and I'm
just using a wet paper towel and
applying those and I actually have seen
these at the dollar store before I got
them at a costume shop so you guys can
try to find them there and that is the
finished vampire look but if you want to
take it up one more step you can always
add fake blood and you know guys know I
love to add Bloods all Halloween looks
and just kind of add that just to the
edge of the mouth and you could also add
it to the bite marks if you want as well
and that is the finished look I hope you
