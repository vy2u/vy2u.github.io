Victoria Secret runway show just
happened and I'm sure all of you guys
watched it I definitely watched it while
eating Wendy's chicken nuggets and some
french fries or just like look at her
body oh my god tweeted if I should do a
tutorial and you guys were like duh so I
was like okay so I actually researched
the makeup artist who had the idea for
what the girls were all going to be
wearing and it was so simple pretty easy
to achieve basically his whole theory
was just to enhance their natural beauty
which isn't hard because they're like
aliens of course Victoria's Secret
people wear like a crapload of bronzer
so that's what I did and I'm also going
to show you guys how to do the hair for
the runway show it actually looked
better before but as you could tell from
the intro I had like the fan going from
my shots and I was like all in slow-mo
getting role Beyonce it'll look better
in the tutorial so if you guys are
interested in this tutorial then keep on
watching alright guys I'm going to start
this look off by prepping my skin I'm
using this nourish organic renewing eye
cream just to hydrate my under eye area
next I'm going to use this Tarte primer
which is the best primer of all time and
I'm going to rub that all over my face
and for my chapped lips I'm using this
NYX Cosmetics butter lip balm in the
shade marshmallow just to hydrate them
I'm mixing my Mac Studio fluid and a
little bit of my Estee Lauder Double
Wear just to get the correct color for
my skin tone and applying that all over
my face with a morphe I believe this is
a morphe G - yeah
and now I'm using my NARS creamy
concealer and I'm just going to Pat that
into my under eye with the same brush
and set it with a little bit of banana
by anasazi up everybody whoo now to
highlight I'm going to be using this
cream highlighting palette by sleek
cosmetics and I'm just going to use my
fingers and Pat that on to the high
points of my face so on top of my
cheekbones and down the bridge of my
nose and on my Cupid's bow and a little
bit on my forehead I'm starting off by
using this cream just to give my skin
more voluminous look like the Victoria's
Secret models and I'm also applying that
to the Cupid's bow as well
next I'm just gonna apply a little bit
more highlighter because enough is not
enough with a Victoria Secret look and
this is my mary-lou manizer by the balm
alright so now we're going to go in with
a ton of bronzer this is matte give me
Sun and I'm applying this everywhere the
Sun would naturally hit me basically all
over my face except for where I
highlighted and this is just going to
give us that Victoria Secret glow and
I'm also going to apply it into the
crease because the makeup did not have a
transition shade in the crease I'm just
using this to define my socket a little
bit more I've been loving this city
color sunset bronzer lately I've been
applying it almost every day over my
normal contour and bronzer and it just
gives the most luminous bronzy effect I
love it so I'm going to apply that
everywhere I applied my bronzer this
also captures the light really
beautifully and i've been using the
morphe g 8 brush to apply all the
powders the Victoria Secret girls had
baby pink cheeks so I'm taking the pink
from my pin-up girl palette by Tarte and
applying that just to the apples of my
cheeks and that is the face completed
now it's time to move on to the eyes i'm
using this Milani brow gel in clear and
just grooming my brows quickly with that
and then my honest hacia brow is in
chocolate they didn't have super defined
brows actually the makeup artist said he
only wanted to fill in where it was
sparse so for me that's the whole second
half of my brows so I'm just going to go
ahead and fill that in just so it's nice
and even
and then I'm taking my Mac girl/boy brow
gel which is a light colored brow gel
just to lighten up the brow now I'm
taking the shade in topaz by Anasazi of
Beverly Hills and I'm using a Mac 217 to
pack that all over my lid and slightly
blend it into my crease they didn't have
much eye makeup they just had a really
nice bronzy shade and no transition
shade in the crease that's why I use the
bronzer just to give a little bit of
definition and I'm also going to run
that on my lower lash line next I'm
taking brownie by Anastacio Beverly
Hills which is a slightly darker bronze
shade not too much darker and just
applying that to the outer corners of
our eyes to give a little bit more
dimension for the inner corner we want a
highly pigmented product so I'm using
this Kaelin cosmetics mineral eye polish
in the inner corners of my eyes to
brighten them up and I'm also going to
put it just in the center of my lid to
capture the light and a tad bit on the
brow bone I'm taking deep Brown by
Anastasia Beverly Hills and an angled
brush and I'm just gonna pack that on to
the lash line on the outer portion of my
eye and they did not have black eyeliner
this year and they didn't really wing it
out either they just kind of gave
definition to the outer portion of the
eye I did notice a couple of girls
wearing winged liners but I think that
they're owed ease so they let them do
that to define my lashes a little bit
I'm using the Tarte light camera lashes
mascara and I'm just going to apply that
to the top and bottom before I apply my
and for false lashes I'm using these
social eyes lashes in minks this is my
first time using this lash brand but I
really really love this style they just
look really flirty and feathery and I
really like that especially for the
Victoria's Secret look for the lips the
girls had a very natural flesh tone
color with a slight pink undertone so
I'm using this la girl lip liner in
natural and I'm lightly applying that
all over my lips and then I'm just going
to kind of dab it away with my finger
because you want it to be as natural as
possible and for a gloss in the center
of the lips I'm using Sigma's dazzling
lip fix now moving onto the hair you
want to protect your hair from any heat
damage I'm using the sexy hair blowout
heat defense spray and applying that all
over my hips so
you want to just take half your hair up
just to get it out of the way and then
pick up one to two inch sections and
wrap them around a barrel I'm using my
Bellamy six and one and as you guys can
see I'm holding it downwards and I left
the end of the hair out of the curl so
it has more of a natural Bend not so
much a big curl because this year they
said they wanted just the hair to have a
little bit of organic bends that's
thirds they used so I'm just quickly
going through and doing the same process
over and over again
there's no for you to with your eyes
closed and me as your fellow feels
they're Stone you too
your gentle breath
not to give my hair that messy texture
II feel I'm spraying this spray by
Bumble and Bumble it's just a
texturizing spray which I find works
really good with my hair especially now
that I got the Brazilian Blowout and
it's making my hair super flat which a
mud fan but yeah so now I have more
texture and that's the hair done alright
