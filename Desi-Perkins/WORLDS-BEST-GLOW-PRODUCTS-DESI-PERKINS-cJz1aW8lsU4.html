by all the questions I got the other day
on what I use to give my body that glow
what I use to get the glow there's
always a lot of questions about the glow
everyone wants to look I thought oh I
should do a video with all my favorite
glow products everything that I love to
use you want to glow all year round I'm
trying to show up to these winter
parties glowing I'm gonna be talking
about some skin prep items for glowing
all my favorite liquid highlights powder
highlights body highlights we get really
close really intimate if you guys are
interested in this then keep on watching
what I want the ultimate glow I always
start with the prep for the glow and
this is kind of the after skincare stuff
you get that extra bit of glow in your
skin before makeup application I
especially do these steps if I know I'm
not gonna be wearing foundation and I
just want my skin to look extra good and
spot conceal I use two products and the
first product is Mac strobe cream and
this is in gold light there's different
shades of strobe cream this stuff is a
beautiful moisturizer that gives you a
high shine finish to your face it looks
so nice and natural daylight if you're
having a no makeup day and you want to
look like you're glowing from what sin I
swear this stuff is like the best I've
been putting this on the high points of
my face down the bridge of my nose
anywhere you highlight I apply this
moisturizer you can even apply it over
your whole face but that's just what I
do so as you can see it has the
consistency of a moisturizer and it just
looks healthy and glowy and honestly
under these lights it's not even doing
it that much justice but it looks so
radiant the next item I'm pretty excited
about to be honest with you guys I've
seen it all over Instagram and I just
didn't think it was like for real I I
didn't really know what it was I just
see people like making those videos
where they like drip drop oil on their
face and recently they sent it to me and
I was like I'm gonna I'm gonna to see
what's up with this stuff it's the Far
Sally rose gold elixir and it is
actually so balm I saw that it helps
with discoloration and texture of the
skin and it's also really hydrating kind
of looks like my backdrop is super
pretty
and you just put a few drops of this
onto your face and I like to Pat it into
my skin and I also do this before
applying my foundation and it looks
Mel's feels all of the above incredible
makes my skin look extra hydrated and
then it makes my foundation go on better
I do let it sit on my skin for a while
before I put my foundation on just cuz I
don't want to be too like slippery or
anything mmm smells amazing you guys
have to smell it if you're into oils for
the face I love this warszawa oil moving
on I'm gonna go into liquid illuminators
for the face I have two that I've talked
about before I still have been using
this cocktail it has not changed I think
I started doing this when I went to
Shanghai with Stephen a lot of you guys
were saying how dewy and crazy like
glowy my skin looked and it's because I
was mixing these two which is the iconic
London illuminator drops and then the
other one is the Marc Jacobs do you
drop's the reason I like to mix them
together is because the iconic London
illuminator drops are very very strong
this is the iconic London highlight and
this is the Marc Jacobs highlight and
already you can see here this is
basically like a foil but you see that
you see what I'm saying and then this is
the Marc Jacobs which totally has a
different consistency still very very
high shine still very beautiful but has
a totally different finish than the
iconic one both beautiful on their own
but together I swear it's like power
couple okay I put a drop of each
together and I blend it with my Beauty
Blender apply it to the high points of
my face and it is gorgeous incredible
amazing you know I was gonna move on to
powdered highlights but I want to put my
lip product on so I'm moving on to my
favorite high shine lip gloss and that
of course is the desi xkt dose of colors
lip gloss I love this lip gloss so much
actually my favorite on top of just nude
lips as in like bear lips for me I love
to put it on for that effortless look
and glosses are really really poppin
right now they're making a huge comeback
I would say this is like
very very light shear lip gloss with the
most beautiful tiny gold reflex you've
ever seen when you're in the sunlight it
is like whoa I sped on my own momentum
what's that one oh my god do you see
this like you just want to be out in the
Sun light keeps me that is my favorite
glow product for the lips and I was
waiting to put it on for the video I
just wanted to get to that first we're
gonna move on to powder highlights now
and I'm gonna give you guys all of my
favorite highlights of course number one
being the desi xkt highlights obviously
these are my favorites because Katie and
I created them with dose of colors to be
our favorites and I know that we just
had the final restock and these are our
limited edition so I will give you guys
my other highlights that I love just in
case you can't get your hands on these
anymore
one of them is Fuego and this is the
lighter of the two and minami is a
little bit more for medium to deep skin
tones and that's this one right over
here obviously you guys know I love
these highlights I don't have to tell
you I'm not being biased just my babies
so this is way go right of AHA oh I love
that these are so finely milled I would
say so that they don't look chunky on
your face they look really pretty and
just glossy actually and then this one
is a minimal so you can see the slight
difference this one has more of a rose
gold undertone and then there is more of
a color to this one and this one is more
like a light champagne gold both very
reflective but not too chunky for your
face my babies now moving on to another
highlight which is bomb it basically
came to the drugstore world and said I'm
gonna kill it and that is the master
chrome by Maybelline this highlight is
like the best drugstore highlight I have
ever seen in my life I can't open it at
the moment because I have all types of
illuminating stuff on my hands oh my god
my hands are so slippery
benka here it is and this highlight is
just so beautiful this is a shade of
molten gold
I think this highlight has just become a
staple for a lot of people because not
only does it one range from like eight
to ten dollars depending on where you
buy it which is so affordable but it is
on the level performance wise of like
the highest and highlighters out there
everybody who has tried this is just
like died for it this is a swatch of the
master chrome highlight very very
beautiful so it's a little bit deeper of
a gold than Fuego but not much and
lastly for the more expensive highlights
this is the bronze goddess
estee lauder heat wave highlight this
 right clearly I love it a lot look
at what it looks like at this point in
my life I travel with this one in
particular all the time it is on the
more pricey side I think this range is
for around $45 and that's pricey okay
but it is really really good this one I
would say has a little bit more flexible
itter in it not a lot not like oh my god
there's a crapload of glitter on your
face but a little bit more than the
other highlights that I showed you guys
that reason I do love to pop a little
bit of this on the very high points of
the cheeks very high point of the
forehead you know how you put a
highlight like all right here so I will
apply this like right here right here
right just right in the center of all
the highest points of the highlighted
areas and it's just like boom your
cheekbones pop out your nose highlight
pops out your chin is like mmm here is a
swatch of the heatwave you can see
there's like a little bit more flecks of
glitter than the other ones but it's so
reflective has a very high shine finish
you guys are probably looking at the
swatches of these highlights and like
thinking they all look the same
maybe they do okay maybe they do on
camera but in
person they all have a different formula
a different finish and a different
undertone and that can change if you
like it or not for example maybe
somebody with a little bit more texture
in the areas isn't gonna want to
highlight with more glitter the least
amount of glitter the better for them or
maybe you're somebody who loves that
like high-intensity glitter you know
it's all trial and error and I'm sure
they all look the damn same on camera
but they are not okay promise you and
lastly for the powder highlight products
is the Becca cosmetics collaboration
with Chrissy Teigen beautiful the
packaging loved it so much really I
haven't used much from this palette
except this one right here
hibiscus bloom is poppin okay the reason
I love this color in particular is
because it works as the most beautiful
cheek blush highlight like right here
some people may not want to put
highlight there some people do I just
was playing around with it because at
first I didn't really get the palette I
was confused by the colors I felt like
maybe I wasn't drawn to it and then I
saw a picture of Chrissy Teigen and she
has those like amazing high cheeks and I
noticed like she had a little highlight
like right here on the cheeks and I was
like that looks really pretty so I
decided to try it with this blusher
color because I wanted to put it on top
of my blush and it was like
life-changing okay it's like right at
the top of the apple of my cheeks I just
kind of graze it there and it has like
this slightly pinkish blush undertone
that makes you look not only highlighted
but flushed at the same time I love to
apply this as like a blush topper this
is something I reach for almost every
single day I do eye makeup especially on
the days that I want that fresh no
makeup makeup look now we're gonna move
on to face sprays and this is very
important when highlighting I repeat
very important when highlighting at the
end of highlighting at the end of
applying powders to your skin you want
everything to look like your skin so
spraying your face with some type of
setting spray or some type of glow spray
is really going to help the overall
finish of your makeup application and
when it comes to the highlighted parts
of your face in particular these are two
sprays that I am
something you guys I'm sure are all very
familiar with
it's the tatcha luminous dewy skin
amidst so many people rave about this I
know a lot of celebrity makeup artists
who use this as well it's like
ride-or-die a lot of people apply like
so much of this but when I did meet with
Tasha before they did say two sprays is
what they recommend is what is supposed
to be sprayed like one two but we'd be
out here like spraying that like
showering in it right
I especially notice when I try to do
that it does sound like a dewy or finish
so I do see that like when I try to put
too much it kind of will give like
little oil spots I mean you can always
go in and like with your Beauty Blender
I like to spray this just over all the
areas that I applied the powder
highlight because it makes the highlight
look more like skin it gives it more of
that wet shiny look sometimes when you
look straight forward you could see the
powder sitting on top of the skin and
this is going to stop that it's gonna
just really melt the highlight into the
cheekbone so that when you are looking
straight you don't see a cast of powder
and it looks good from every angle so I
love the dewy skin mist this without
makeup also looks incredible if you just
want to be out the door you want to just
go to the grocery store really quick I
put a little bit more of this on when I
don't have foundation or anything I like
to really but what I do I just keep it
to like the two sprays or maybe like
three oh and then another thing about
this notch is dewy skin mist this is
something I learned on Wayne Gauss's
channel so he said that what you can do
to keep your under eyes from that
powdery Creasy look is applying a little
spritz of this to your Beauty Blender
and just tapping it lightly on top of
your under eyes after you set them with
powder and that's a huge trick to get
your eyes from looking less dry and
Crocky underneath that's because there
is a particular ingredient in here that
stops that from happening
okay watch his video way more detailed
about why and how that works for the
under eye but I've been doing it ever
since
I watched his video so that's just such
a good tip as product is the newest
addition to my current glow products
whereas all of these other things I've
been using for months and months and
months this one is the newest this is
the Sephora perfection mist and nude
glow no Patrick Hall was raving about
this who's also like a really great
makeup artist that I love and this
product is something that like the
taught to do a skin mist you want to put
on the high points of your face so like
let's hit the forehead real quick right
oh god I got to close I think try not to
get too close like I just did see that I
mean that just really brought me home
here grace to piggy rotisserie chicken
cousin like right here see that this in
particular is really good if you're
gonna be taking photos and video red
carpet anymore where there's like lights
just casting on your face I mean it
gives the most beautiful effect like
your skin is gonna look so healthy
you're gonna look so hydrated okay do
you see this so this is what it looks
like with the spray and then here
without still looks glossy still looks
highlighted but just this is another
effect that you could give yourself
available x4 calm and then of course we
have the mac fix+ spray this is kind of
like everyone has to have this it's a
staple and everybody's collection you
could use this before makeup you could
use this for setting your makeup and you
could use this to intensify the glow on
your powder highlight which is
definitely what I use it for this stuff
as you can see it's like everyday for me
I have my backup ready to go over here
get you some mac fix+ ooh yes those
inexpensive spritz I did for the camera
for you guys so the other day I did a
red carpet and I put so much goodness on
my body and this is the exact cocktail
that
I used the other day this is called the
body glow bronzing body oil from NARS
and the reason I used this one is
because it does have a bronze glow so if
you want to give your skin a little bit
more of a tan without self-tanning or
anything like that this is gonna look
really really nice as you can see that
is like a nice deep tan and it just
gives your skin a nice color boost if
you highlight your face and your body
showing you want your body to be
highlighted as well I felt really bad
for my driver because after I got out of
his car it looked like somebody took a
Costco rotisserie chicken and just like
rubbed it all over his seats like I was
like now I'm feeling tan now I feel like
all the bronzy parts of my face are
matching the body so that's good we
added a little bit of color it's bronze
it's matching the bronze areas of our
face but now you want to bring in some
highlights you could just see me like
this the light does hit this and it
looks really nice but it's just not like
damn you want it to be like damn okay
I'm gonna be using Fuego and this is the
lighter of the to fly it to the high
points of the body so boom you can use a
less dense brush maybe like this one put
the highlight on your shoulder put it on
the high point and then blend out the
edges and also bring it down the center
of your arm see that like look at that
already we're matching our face to our
body alright so this is also important I
hope you guys aren't like oh my god
there's a lot of boob in my face but
it's important for girls out there who
want to make their boobs look even
better on camera so I like to hit this
part of my boob with a highlight just
gonna make your boobs look firmer plumpy
err I hope you guys aren't thinking this
is like pervy this is important you need
to know these things you want to hit the
center we're getting so close and first
of all right now this Center right here
do you see that such a huge difference
well you know we just have to be real
here this makes the boobs look way
better and
I'm telling you if you want to take it
up a notch you could even add a light
bronzer I'm using hoola by benefit and
just you know just kind of like just a
little right here just to do it's all
about lights and shadow and making
things look better with your face as
well as with your body I'm sharing these
tips and tricks with you
I hope my breasts in your face weren't
like I really forgot to tell you guys
