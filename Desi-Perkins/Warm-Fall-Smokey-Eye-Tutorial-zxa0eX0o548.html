today I decided to do this look for you
guys it was really requested on my
Instagram and it's perfect for fall
actually and I didn't really I don't
know if I got around to doing a fall
video so here is a look for all of you
guys it plays off of a lot of fall
colors cranberry colors burg oranges and
really warm shades that just bring out
any eye color so if you guys like what
you see then keep on watching
starting off by applying Mac strobe
cream to the face and this gives you
that really dewy complexion so I really
like using it under my foundation now
I'm applying Mac Studio fluid all over
my skin and just blending that in with a
damp be fun
now I'm going to take an angled brush
and whitening Lightning's brow bar and
I'm just filling in the sparse areas of
my brows if you have full brows then you
might not have to do this step but I
have a very sparse brows towards the end
they just don't really want to grow
although I wish they would
now I'm taking max
Blanc tight and I'm just highlighting
the brow bone area and bringing it down
towards the crease so that makes it
easier for us to blend the transition
shade
take a large fluffy brush and here I'm
using Mac saddle for the crease and I'm
just doing this to define the crease and
give us a good guideline also it makes a
very nice transition color when you want
a warm look I'm applying Sigma's
eyeshadow base and the color stripe this
is a really really beautiful deep plum
with cranberry undertones and this will
help our eye shadow become more vibrant
and it will also help it last longer
take a fluffy brush and just blend out
those edges
now I'm taking motives sweet plum
eyeshadow and packing that all over the
lids I'm applying a bit of Max coppering
eyeshadow to the center of the lids just
to brighten that area up it's just a tad
bit lighter than the color we just used
and now take your fluffy brush and blend
all of that together
I'm taking the color sketch by Matt
cosmetics which is a deep purple with
some brown undertones and I'm just
placing that in the outer corners of my
crease to create a little bit more depth
in the eyeshadow look I'm going to take
Mac's red brick which is basically just
an orange colored eyeshadow and I'm
going to use this to blend out all the
edges and create a nice warm halo effect
around the eye shadow that we put down
already
now take your favorite concealer here
I'm using Tarte creaseless concealer and
I'm just using my finger to place that
where I want it first and going in with
a damp Beauty Blender and really working
that into my skin this helps so that
your concealer doesn't crease as well
use a Beauty Blender I'm taking sketch
again and just running that under the
eye then I'm taking that orange color
that we used earlier and blending that
out as well take a pencil brush and
Mac's loose pigment in the color copper
Sparkle and use that to highlight the
inner corners of your eyes then take a
black kohl liner I'm using tarts inner
rim liner in black and I'm just lining
my waterline and I'm also lining the
inside of my upper eyelid curl your
lashes
then add some falsies I'm using town of
lashes and Bemis speeds
hop on your favorite mascara
time to finish off our face makeup so
I'm setting all of that concealer with a
light shade powder to highlight under
the eyes as well as the forehead and the
bridge of the nose
take your bronzer I'm using Makeup
Forever sculpting duo and a RC cosmetic
brush and I'm just running that along
the cheekbones to define the face also
blend that up towards the forehead and
along the jawline now I'm using NARS
blush in sin it's a really nice plummy
color and it just goes well with these
eye shadows and making sure to blend
that really well I don't want too much
of a bright shade of color so I'm just
dabbing on this lipstick and this is
rosewood by motives
now I'm taking one of my favorite lip
gloss colors and this is nude by
whitening lightening if you guys want a

much as I do I'll see you guys in my
