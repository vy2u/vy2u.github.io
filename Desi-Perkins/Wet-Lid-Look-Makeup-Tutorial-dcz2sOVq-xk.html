so today's video is going to be a
tutorial on this makeup look right here
I wanted to do something dramatic but
soft which is kind of what I do I love
doing these kinds of looks really
dramatic crease but then kept the lid
super angelic with like this wet effect
on the lid and yeah everything else is
pretty soft and girly so I hope you guys
enjoy this tutorial let's get started so
the first thing I'm going to do is prep
my skin by using a serum this one is by
coup de lis this is for all skin types
and it's just going to refresh our skin
especially since it's cold out my skin's
been acting all kinds of crazy next I'm
going in with an eye treatment this one
is by atome and it's an illuminating eye
treatment so of course with prepping the
skin you have to prime your skin I
forgot to prime it in the last video
it's not going to happen this time I've
been using the Marc Jacobs primer Mel's
so nice this one's just very hydrating
for a foundation I'm going to try this
new one out I just got it never tried it
before it's the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation and this isn't the shade
honey deep which I'm not sure is my
shade but I am guessing this is my color
might be a little bit dark I don't
really understand the packaging it seems
unsanitary am i doing it wrong
whoa that's a lot darker okay okay mmm
okay definitely not my color that
foundation was a little bit too dark for
me so I'm gonna go ahead and try a shade
down which is honey medium looks really
nice it makes my skin look really good
so I think I could work on the color
perfecting for this foundation a little
bit more but I really really like the
finish of it II brow is by Anastacio
Beverly Hills in the shade caramel and
I'm just gonna use this to fill in my
brows
so next I'm going to go ahead and
highlight my brow bone using the benefit
high brow just gonna pop that on my brow
bone and I'm going to take this bogus
concealer brush it's synthetic so it's
good to blend out creams like this and
you're just gonna lightly blend it
downwards towards your crease to prime
my lids I'm just going to be using this
one here by Elizabeth Mott this is the
thank me later I shadow primer I'm just
going to apply this with my fingers to
my lids just to make sure my eyeshadow
doesn't crease next to cancel out the
redness on my lids I'll be using Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and to apply this
I'm using a 142 concealer buffer I'm
taking this all the way into the crease
and just blending it into the brow bone
highlight that we applied next I'm going
to set the Mac soft ochre using long
type by a mac cosmetics and I'm just
going to run that heavily on my brow
bone to highlight it and then bring it
down to the crease
next I'm picking up Anastacio Beverly
Hills fawn and a Mac two to four brush
and I'm going to blend this into my
upper crease I like to tilt my head back
when I do this because I feel like I can
see my crease a little bit better I'm
going to be bringing this into this brow
bone area here as well really deepening
up this inner suck in line here stop -
using the Mac - - for for a while but
now I'm like why did I ever stop it's
the best brush for doing the upper
crease I'm going to deepen up the crease
a little bit more using budge this is
also by Anasazi of Beverly Hills it's a
really warm deep brown I'm going in with
a Mac 217 brush placing this in the
inner corner of the eye onto the crease
just blend it towards the inside and I'm
also going to do that so the outer part
of the eye and go back into my Mac 217
and just I mean 224 and just kind of
buff it out so over the lid I'm going to
be applying birkin this is by Anastasia
Beverly Hills and I'm going to use a
Smith - 5 6 brush and dust it all over
this space we left open over that I'm
going to be applying a Mac pressed
pigment which had a terrible accident as
of recent and this isn't the shade
beaming there's a lot of fallout it's
okay don't have concealer on but it is
getting all over my foundation
okay so the eyeshadow looks really
pretty but I want to add a little bit
more like glitter so I'm going to try to
use just a light dab of this NYX crystal
bold dramatic Sparkle I don't want it to
be like a lot of glitter I want it to
look more just like random glitter
everywhere so I'm trying to just dot it
and then use my finger picking up some
of this chlorine floral water makeup
remover I'm just going to lightly take
some of that and remove the glitter
under my eyes before applying my
concealer for concealer I'll be using
the NARS creamy concealer and I'm in the
shade ginger okay so I applied the
ginger now I'm taking custard which is
slightly lighter and just highlighting
with this on this cheekbone area and on
the nose I'm going to take my Beauty
Blender and just start blending all of
it out
to set everything I'll be using the
tarte cosmetics smooth Amazonian clay
translucent powder this is the smooth
upper Raider applying not using a
japonesque brush this is one of my
favorites for under-eye powder it's the
915 so now we're just going to finish
off the lower lash line and I'm going to
smoke the lower lash line a lot taking
up fawn on a pencil brush and I'm just
going to start applying that pretty low
on the lash line to define my lower lash
line I'm going to be using this
infallible eyeshadow this is in the
shade 800 going to be using that to
further smoke this lower lash line now
for the waterline I'll be using the
benefit high brow that we used earlier I
really like this in the waterline I make
the ugliest waterline face hole please
to add a little volume to my little
lashes I'll be using the benefit they're
real mascara you want to coat the top
and bottom with this in the Ipsy glam
bag this month they have the demi 120
from ardell which are some of my
favorite drugstore eyelashes I'm just
going to go ahead and put those on then
I'm just going to hold them up a little
bit next you want to pick up an
eyeshadow that has really good
pigmentation because we want the inner
corner to pop this is the glamour dolls
eyeshadow it's in the shade new dress
and it's the Double Trouble eyes shadow
so I'm just going to put that in the
inner corner
overtop of that I'll be taking the hot
makeup eyeshadow this is in the shade
harmony it's like a really pretty
metallic just want to intensify it only
in the very inner corner so I'm just
putting a little bit of that on
it's again it's just going to make the
eyes look a little bit more like that
wet dewy look
whew the inner corners are poppin though
moving on I'm just going to go and
finish off the rest of my face I'll be
picking up my L'Oreal True Match I use
this in my drugstore video and I really
liked it this is in the shade c6
if you guys want me to compare it next
to hold please
oh if you want me to compare it next to
Matt give me Sun it's a little bit more
Orient this is a little deeper that's
the difference between Matt give me Sun
and the L'Oreal this is actually just a
setting powder but I really like the
finish of this so I'm gonna use my Mac
137 to apply it just because it is super
pigmented this brush applies a very
light amount of product at a time which
is what I want to really bronze up my
skin because I don't care if it's winter
or summer or whatever like I always want
to look really tan got to get in those
baby hairs
why do I have so many of them
next I'm going into Matt gold deposit
and I'm going to use the same brush
because like I said it distributes a
little bit of product so this I like to
put between my highlighter and my
bronzer because it's more of a gold glow
it's a tiny bit here so I'm going to
spray the Anastacio a 23 brush get it
nice and damp and then I go into the
gilded honey this is my favorite
highlighter right now just because it
has a nice gold undertone which works
better with my skin tone someone take
that just put it right here oh girl this
is always my favorite part you see that
Jeff
Jeff's face is like this yeah you see
that I mean look at that that's what
happens when you dampen the brush and it
actually makes it look less powdery -
yeah girl I'm gonna put some on my nose
some people don't like this but I'm not
one of those people I love it I'm also
gonna put some right up here cuz I want
just so much light on my face just glow
here I think that's enough as you guys
can see my lips are ridiculously dry
they're so bad right now I'm going to
use a little bit of a polish before I
put my liquid lipstick on just so
they're not like looking this is the
skin
Dimitri James sugar lips polishing scrub
for dry lips
looks like this for the lip colors
there's just so many possibilities with
this makeup because it is neutral you
can wear red you can wear dark you you
could wear brown which is if you want to
go for that like monotone look I wish I
could just wear this bottle actually
look how pretty it looks Jeff really
would like me to wear this color so if
you guys don't like it you can blame him
not me I wanted to go with something
else but it's fine this is the girl
lactic matte lip paint in strips
pretty like it I like it Jeff good
choice why I'm gonna use a blush this is
the Too Faced love flush palette it's
super cute look at how cute it is Meeta
I'm going to be using a I will always
love you which is this tone right here
