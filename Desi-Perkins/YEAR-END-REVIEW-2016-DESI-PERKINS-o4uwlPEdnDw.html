coming to an end now and it's just crazy
this has been one of the most amazing
years for me it's definitely a year that
I'll never forget where I felt like a
lot of things happened for me in a good
way it was definitely one of those years
where you just look back at what you're
doing and your life whether it be that
week that month or even that day where I
just wanted to pinch myself every second
because I couldn't believe that these
things were happening this year it's
crazy because I feel like growing up
when I was younger I always wanted to be
in front of the camera I used to just
always want so many things as a kid I
remember thinking about like all these
big dreams that I had extremely big
dreams there were so many things that
I've always wanted but I didn't know how
to like conceptualize them into one
dream this is Desiree and I'm seeing but
never see yeah good dream I looked back
and realized like wow like baby desi
like you really had these big dreams and
they didn't come together like you
thought but somehow I'm still doing all
those things that I love to do as a kid
and this is the first year that like I
made them into my career really I used
to draw all the time and design things
and want to be a designer one of the
things I was most proud of this year was
doing the designing the sunglass line
with Kia Australia we are here
for these hot fire key sunglass and does
he go to him the minute they ask me to
do the collab i remember getting out a
piece of paper a notepad and i started
sketching out all the sunglasses ideas
that I had seeing something that you
want to create come to life is one of
the best feelings that you could
possibly feel it's crazy how some
sunglasses can make you feel so happy
but it wasn't really the sunglasses it
was doing what I always wanted to do
which was designing and it coming to
life and then seeing the amount of
support that you guys gave me was
incredible
I felt so moved by that and I still do
every time you guys post pictures
there's also little things that I did
this year that I think I should recap on
like for a hot second I decided to go
brunette and that was fun I guess a lot
of you guys could have expected that I'd
quickly go back blonde which I did this
year I also got a new family member
who's very loving we got to adopt
cannoli and she has brought so much
happiness into my life this year you
guys have no idea I remember the first
day we went to go meet cannoli I thought
we were just gonna go meet her
see if Harford her got along for a
second and they kind of just said here
take her home with you and see how it
goes and I wasn't expecting to take her
home that day but there we were with a
little puppy she was small she could fit
in Stephens pocket it was so cute and we
took her to John and Katie's house and
she got along with the squad just fine
she's crazy
wild you can't control her and she's
been such a shady dog ever since you
know she just I guess I have shady dogs
I can't forget my birthday this year
happy birthday I wanted to do something
really low-key and Steven was just so
sweet which then went
how can we forget that one time I fell
on my ass on my birthday that was also
great I really enjoyed that in 2016 I
was so fortunate to visit so many
different beautiful places places that
you dream about
when I'm trying me
we were able to do so many fun things
things that I usually would be scared to
do but still did them anyway
going on these trips you get to meet and
make memories with so many people so
many good times crazy times drunk times
2016 is definitely the year of traveling
if somebody would have told me hey does
in 2016 you're going to be all over
sephora's nationwide I would have said
don't mind me
but this year I did a nationwide
campaign with Benefit Cosmetics my face
along with Katy crispy and Kristin was
all over sephora's nationwide and it was
amazing getting an email in 2016 that
says collaboration with JLo was one of
the biggest highlights of the year I've
been a fan of her ever since I saw her
play Selena - finally one day get the
opportunity to fly to Vegas and to meet
her and to work with her in Kohl's
was unreal they took a photo of me
hugging her and you just see my hands
like on her back just like little claws
holding on so tight I mean you guys can
understand it's kind of crazy it's kind
of crazy how could I forget the squad
tour that Katie John Stephen and I had
this year we were all sitting around one
night and we thought to ourselves why
don't we just fly all over and see where
people want us to go fly there and have
meetups and meet all of you guys we just
packed our bags and we flew to so many
different locations and it was
incredible it was one of the most
amazing experiences of my life
I've never felt so many emotions so much
love so much just energy and
that's when I knew that really the squad
was the real deal because if you can
travel with somebody for that many days
together and be tired and just be under
all this craziness with those people
then you know that you guys are good
friends it was definitely a huge team
effort this year on my youtube channel
we hit 2 million subscribers which is
incredible 2 million subscribers and I
hit 3 million on Instagram if I can
think of two videos that really stand
out this year I would say the Salina one
was definitely number one in that video
put me on the first page of a newspaper
The Melting skull video which was a
nightmare to film but after everything
we went through trying to film a video
it just did so well it was one of those
videos that I was just about to give up
on and I didn't and we filmed until five
o'clock in the morning there it is the
school video he got nominated for a
streaming award that was really cool I
mean I didn't win but it was still
really cool to be nominated to be
recognized one of the trips I got to do
this year was go to Paris for the
Victoria's Secret Show Paris during the
holidays which is magical and the
feeling I got going to the Victoria's
Secret Show was similar to that of the
first time your parents debuted
because when I was a kid I used to watch
to be a model I didn't know what that
meant I was like five
and for years I dreamt of being a
Victoria's Secret model like I actually
had that as one of my dreams I thought
maybe that's the possibility for me
until I realized like I wasn't tall
enough then I just thought okay maybe
that's not going to happen for me but I
did for a long time want to be a
Victoria's Secret Angel but just going
was incredible there's just so many
things about 2016 that I'm grateful for
ending the year just now coming back
from Seattle to do a charity with other
youtubers that we admire so much
Benji and Judy thank you so much for
having us in Seattle this year for dance
number a charity this year that helped
feed 50,000 children I was so excited to
be a part of that it's also one of my
new year's resolutions to do more things
like that and that's kind of everything
that happened in 2016 it was one of the
best years of my life I've definitely
had bad years but this wasn't one of
them this year more than ever I feel
like I'm finally really confident and
comfortable with who I am and myself and
I think there's so many years that
you're looking to find yourself and you
feel a little bit lost and you lose
direction but this year I felt like I
knew who I was of course there's always
going to be growth from this and I'm
always going to be growing but I feel
comfortable with who I am now and I feel
more open with you guys I feel like I
can be on snapchat and be silly and I
know that takes so many years to find
and once you do it's just really a
freeing feeling I can't wait to see what
2017 has the store thank you guys for an
amazing year and for all the support I
can never thank you guys enough for
continuing to be there for me and
support me and show me the love that you
guys do so thank you and I'll see you
guys in 2007 I'm done
we're so nude right now we're gonna talk
about me at all did I talk about you I
don't know I did you yeah I said that I
got to go to Paris with you as a
plus-one you're in all these things with
me this is all you the birthday okay go
on the birds may the trips we've gone on
the fact that you hated me while filming
the skull video Oh 100% yes um going to
Paris with you and getting to dress up
and be all cute together yeah a secret
