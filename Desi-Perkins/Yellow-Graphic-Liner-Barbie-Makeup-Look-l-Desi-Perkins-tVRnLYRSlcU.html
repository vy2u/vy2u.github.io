for today's video we're gonna be doing
this makeup look right here I am a
neutrals girl you guys know this there's
a lot of neutral colors on my channel I
wanted to do something with color but
still make it comfortable for those who
are neutral fans just like me so I feel
like with this look it's still like all
together as a whole semi neutral but you
have like your pops of color peeking
through with the yellow liner and then
also with this bright lip
I feel like this look is so girly and
just fresh so if you guys are interested
in knowing how to get this makeup look
then keep watching so the first thing
I'm going to do is prep my face I always
use a primer this one is the cover
effects illuminating primer I've been
loving this one just because I've been
using a matte foundation and I don't
like my skin to look super dry and matte
so using an illuminating primer is gonna
kind of give my skin just like more of a
dewy moisturized finish I really can't
stop using this foundation I'm just in
love with it it's the Loreal Pro matte
infallible foundation use my Beauty
Blender this Beauty Blender is
completely damp like I just ran it under
the sink the coverage on this foundation
is like I feel like I talked about it in
every video but it's just so good I look
straight into the camera I feel like I'm
looking into like your soul now that
I've applied my base I'm gonna let it
kind of settle into the skin and move on
to the eyes then we'll finish off the
skin afterwards so I'm going to prime my
lids with Mac soft ochre Paint Pot some
people have told me that even with this
eyeshadow base their eyeshadow creases I
recommend using a very very light layer
of this so another thing you can do if
your lids do crease up a little bit more
is make sure to set that cream base so
that way it doesn't move around as much
I'm using Blanc
by Anastacio Beverly Hills I usually use
this color just because it's similar to
the color of the
actual soft ocher base and just kind of
sweep that along where you find you
crease more this is also going to make
it a lot easier for us to blend any
eyeshadows into the crease blang blang I
say it wrong I know it's not belong it's
blah blah blah I'm going to be using the
tartlet palette here from Tarte
cosmetics and I'm going to pack supermom
onto the lid
so for the crease I'm going to first
pick up this shade right here it's just
a really light brown kind of like a
latte color I'm using the Sigma blending
brush this is the e25 which is my
favorite I'm gonna take this color and
just swipe it through the crease
and as I get to the outer corner I like
kind of blend out this way so that way
there's no like abrupt stop here just
kind of lightly feathers out what I want
to do is focus a darker brown in the
outer crease and the inner crease Cui's
cookies
kind of giving like a sandwich
cut crease is what I'm going to call it
so a sandwich cut crease you'll see in a
second so I'm just going to take dreamer
from the same palette I'm going to pick
that up on a defined crease brush this
is from makeup geek
this is my first time using this brush
but it's like perfect for this because
it has a really defined tip so that you
could cut the crease but then it's
fluffy it gets fluffier as the brush
goes on so then it blends out the crease
as well same thing with the inner part
of the eye so right in here I'm just
going to pop that dark shade you guys
could use any eye shadows you have at
home for this look you don't have to use
this palette although this palette is
like a really good one just if you like
neutrals clearly I do it helps to open
your eyes slightly when you do the inner
corner because especially if your eye
tends to fold in like this eye on me see
how it folds into like one two this is
so hard to do all the time so if you
keep your eye open you can see where the
eyeshadow is really going to be when
your eyes are open and that's what
matters so the next step is the eyeliner
which is the star of the show this is
the new anastacio Beverly Hills cream
color and it's in the shade yellow to
help it be a little bit more liquid
eyeliner texture just because I feel
like it's smoother I'm going to put one
drop of this duraline in to the mixture
duraline is by Inglot and it's something
that I put in my English Elle liner and
it just kind of I don't know brings it
to life and makes it a lot easier to
work with so I just put a drop of that
into the little pot and I will be using
the Sigma small eyeliner brush today
crossing my fingers that I don't mess up
because this is like a tricky eyeliner
could go either way all right hmm
here we go so make sure you anchor your
finger down that's why I didn't do my
concealer yet because I want to make
sure that I could you know my finger
here
and I'm gonna start in the middle and
just kind of dot the yellow eyeliner now
with this cream color you really have to
build up it up to get it to be more
opaque but just work in like light
layers at first just in case for ten you
have a black line here and just kind of
wing out the outer corner here
I don't breathe when I do that
the yellow part isn't actually the
hardest part of this look it's really
getting the black to be thin along the
edge of it because I always do a really
thick liner so to make a thin wing is
like tricky for me I'm going to use the
Kat Von D tattoo liner this is in the
shade trooper which is just black and
because this is a pen I could kind of
map out a line easier but I can't talk
while doing it so hold on
I'm gonna go in with my trusty NYC
liquid liner that looks disgusting
okay so I made it through both eyes
thankfully and now I'm just gonna pop on
a little bit of mascara this is the
roller lash eye benefit I'm gonna pop on
some falsies these I'm so sorry I don't
even know what style they are they're
just from flutter lashes I'm just gonna
pop these on I've worn them a few times
they're very glittery they're kind of
similar to the are gel wispies they're
just very fluttery wispy more on the
natural side because I want the eyeliner
to show through if I wear really heavy
lashes with this look it'll kind of just
take away from the liner and I spend too
much time on that to do that so this is
the look with the lashes on Waldo's dry
now we can go ahead and finish our face
makeup so I'm just going to zoom you
back out a little bit and then we're
going to continue there you go so for
concealer I'm going to be using the
Maybelline age rewind I love this stuff
and this also really highlights my under
eyes so it's really nice because I want
this look to be very fresh fresh and
awake and then of course I'm going to
use my Real Techniques this is the
sculpting brush and I'm just gonna pop
that way in patting motions actually I'm
not going to buff it away I'm gonna Pat
it I'm just going to go ahead and do a
light sweep of powder this is the Mac
Studio Fix powder and I'm just putting
the lightest amount of this over my face
so use this powder to contour my nose
because it is slightly Tanner than my
skin so it's like a perfect contour
shade because it's not too aggressive
next I'm going to bronze my skin and
today I'm going to be using the makeup
forever professional this is the matte
bronze it's pretty tan
and I am using a Mac 168 brush for this
I'm going to go ahead and contour my
face I'll be using as a Natasha de Nonna
I hope I'm saying her name right but
she's an amazing makeup artist and this
is her contouring sculpting powder like
this so I'm just gonna be picking that
up with my 105 zoeva brush this is a
really nice contour color because I
noticed that it's not too warm and it's
not too gray so if you're Tanner it's
not going to make you look ashy and if
you are more fair-skinned it's not going
to make you look too orange it's just
like a perfect shade - like really bring
out the natural contours of your face or
at least make your contours look natural
so for the highlight I'm going to go in
to another one of Natasha's palettes
this is called the glow palette let me
see if there's like a specific color
this is the all-over glow face body
shimmer powder so it says all over face
so I'm assuming it's pretty subtle so
I'm just going to take the same actually
I'm going to go ahead and take this
zoeva this is a 126 powder brush and I'm
gonna kind of pop this all over the face
where I want like a very nice dewy look
so this powder is really nice I'm gonna
also pop it on my cheekbones but I think
I'm gonna use another highlight over top
of it as well
oh wow that's beautiful I don't know I
think might keep it like that
if you guys don't follow her I'll put
her Instagram right here her makeup is
so inspiring like I just love everything
she comes up with Oh her products are
like oh my gosh and with blush and I'm
also going to use one of her blush ish
is the blush duo number two and three
it's like a very peachy shade I'm gonna
pop that on my ELF blush brush
now we're going to go back on to finish
off the eyes really quickly it's not a
lot of steps and then the lips will be
last so I'm going to go ahead and zoom
you guys back in yes that's your cue
okay so for the under eyes I'm going to
go in back in with that really nice
light brown latte color and just run it
across just like we did through the
crease and I'm using a Mac pencil brush
is this Mac know this is a zoeva 230
pencil brush this is going to give like
a nice shadow
then you want to take like an angled
brush so that you have more precision
and go back in with that dark brown and
I'm just going to tack this along the
waterline like not in the waterline but
right underneath it
I like to focus most of the darkness on
the outer corner of the eyes I'm going
to take a nude eye pencil this one is by
NARS and I'm gonna line my waterline
with this it's going to give us that
even more like doe-eyed look so hard to
do this on camera so sorry if I'm like
feel like I have to warm it up on the
back of my hand first lastly go ahead
and apply mascara to your bottom lashes
I'm going to go ahead and do that off
camera because mine are so small then I
have to go really closely to the mirror
I'll be using the OCC lip pencil this is
in the shade anime it's like a hot pink
color
this is Karina and it's by anastacio
Beverly Hills it's a liquid lipstick
just gonna apply that
all right and then after you apply your
lipstick that is the last step of the
makeup look I really hope that you guys
