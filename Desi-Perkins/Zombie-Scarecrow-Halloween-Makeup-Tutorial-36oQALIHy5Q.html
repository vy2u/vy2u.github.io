tutorial but with the twist
my husband was nice enough to let me
turn him from this to this so if you
like what you see then keep on watching
start off with some liquid latex and
apply that around the nose with a brush
that you don't care for because it does
tend to ruin brushes then I'm taking
nose and scar wax and I'm just taking a
little ball of that applying it to the
nose and blending it into the skin with
my fingers now it does get sticky so
applying lotion to your hands before
makes it easier to blend then go back
with the liquid latex and feather out
those edges so that it blends better
into the skin once you apply makeup
now I'm taking a really light Mac
Foundation and this white from the
makeup forever palette and I'm mixing
those together and applying it all over
the face with a beauty sponge
try not to layer this on too thick
because it just starts to look really
cakey if you apply white makeup too
thick just blend it like you would
normal foundation now I'm mixing this
brown color with this red and a little
bit of black and I'm taking this brush
here and just kind of creating texture
to the skin so I'm gonna start by making
lines going in one direction and then
I'm going to cross over and make lines
in the opposite direction giving it a
cross-stitch effect and just do that all
over the face now I'm going back in with
that mixture of foundation and white
paint and covering this nose area which
I forgot to do earlier
now do the stitch effect around the nose
as well this will also help all of that
blend butter
then I went in with just black and
created a little bit of texture on the
forehead up towards the center now I'm
taking this chroma line by Mac in black
black and a flat Sigma brush and I'm
just applying that to the nose now take
a black liner and just draw out these
sockets and this does not have to be
perfect at all it's just a rough shape
of what we're gonna fill in later
also take that same liner and create a
line from the corners of the mouth
straight out and it's fun to smudge this
because this look is scary and it's kind
of based on being imperfect so it's okay
to have any mistakes it almost gives it
more character make sure you also fill
in the center of the lips now I'm going
back in with that matte chroma line and
the same flat brush that we used earlier
and filling in those eye sockets
now take that same liner and just line
the inner waterline as you can see he's
having difficulty with that here I'm
just setting all of that makeup with
black eyeshadow and I'm just using Urban
Decay's blackout for this I find it's
one of the blackest shadows on the
market and I love it take an angled
brush with that black face paint or curl
line whatever you're using and just
start kind of messily making squiggle
lines from the eyes up and there's
really no way to do this just kind of
eyeball where you want these messy lines
to go smudging them with your fingers
helps give that really scary effect so
just make sure to blend with your
fingers
and also do them coming down from the
eye sockets as well
time to draw in the teeth and once again
there is no right or wrong way just kind
of make lines going up and down and
smudge them with your finger
now I'm taking this Sigma brush and the
brown from the makeup forever palette
and I'm just kind of creating a little
bit more cross stitching where I'd like
it to stand out more
take the same brush that you just used
in a little bit of red and just map out
where you want your stitches to be now I
just cut up little pieces of this twine
and I put eyelash glue on both ends took
tweezers and as you can see here I'm
just kind of sticking it to the top of
the nose and then curving it under the
scar wax that we used earlier and just
kind of using the tweezers and the scar
wax to hold it down I'll take a matte
bronzer or any Brown shadow that you
have and I'm taking this Sigma fluffy
blending brush and I'm kind of just
going into random areas and shading just
to give a little bit of depth and also
give a more scarecrow color I guess more
Browns and you know just kind of
they cube is pop here and there
now I'm taking just a craft brush and
some of the white from the makeup
forever palette and I mixed it with a
little bit of yellow because zombie
teeth are definitely not white and I'm
just filling in the teeth areas not too
bright just a very very light hint of
color
I'm also gonna take that mixture and
highlight a few portions around the face
to give more depth here and there now
I'm taking this eyelash glue and you
guys could use spirit gum but my husband
is allergic to it so be careful with
spirit gum because it does give some
people a rash but I'm I'm just putting
eyelash glue where I want again these
stitches and taking the tweezers and
sticking it and then take your eyelash
glue again and kind of seal it so it
really stays all night and this did stay
all night so I was really surprised but
it worked out really well
and just to let you guys know that
eyelash glue is specifically for these
looks so I know implying it's straight
to the face but if you guys are planning
on using it on someone else do not apply
it straight to the face just for
sanitary purposes here I mixed some
black and red from the palette and I'm
just kind of going over the glue so that
it looks like it's really stitched into
the face and I'm also going to do this
on the stitching on the nose areas
take some blood scab and I'm applying
this with a craft brush again and I'm
just putting it everywhere where the
stitches are now I like this scab blood
because it doesn't drip and once it sets
it dries so it's not gonna get all over
your clothes or all over someone else's
clothing I picked up this zombie dirt
from Party City and I'm taking a fluffy
brush and just kind of putting it all
over the place to make him look really
dirty and he's wearing a hat so I don't
have to worry too much about it but make
sure you get the ears now I picked up
this hey looking stuff from a craft
store and I'm just sticking it all over
the place and add your straw hat and
you're done
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and
I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
