what
that was another hair abuse so this week
I'm sporting today guys from RPG hair
calm now initially when I open the box
they did send me two wigs that I
reviewed one a few weeks ago and then
I'm reviewing this one today so I didn't
look to see like the specs correctly
until now now when I first got this unit
I kind of looked and I was like wow this
is a really big density when I usually
get these curly units they're about like
150% density 130 just because some
companies feel like because as currently
it's gonna be big and you don't have to
emphasize the thickness too much so this
one is actually a 180 percent density
guys and straight out the pack when I
saw it I was like damn this is some
really nice big hair now I never wet my
hair on video sometimes I just take a
 out the box and kind of like comb
it out so this time when I decide to do
for those videos wet the hair say it's
can see what the hair looks like when
when it's wet and when it's dry so I
basically wet as much as I can around
the unit and mostly a lot in the front I
did get the back a little bit but not as
much as a front I really like this here
guys now I'm not really someone that
likes a lot of kinky textured hair but
this one is really nice so this one is
Brazilian virgin water wave 360 wig it's
a high quality pretty curly hair it's 20
inches long and it's a 180 percent
density now I kind of don't consider
this a water wave I consider this just
kind of like curly hair or kinky curly
hair so that's what I'm gonna call it I
do really like you guys and like I said
an issue when I tried it on in the
beginning the video I was like yo this
hair is actually pretty thick so now I'm
gonna look out at the hints very very
thick guys and it is pre plucked in the
front so though company did a really
good job with that so I didn't have to
do a lot with this you know guys the
only thing that I did was cut the baby
hairs and glue them down just around the
perimeter like I usually do I'm like you
guys can see look at how buff this is
and I even went back there and tried to
comb it on add some more water in just
to kind of like make it more of a
defined curl like I said I usually don't
do that in my videos I'll just take the
wig off the Box take a wide tooth comb
and like comb it out but I wanted to
show you guys what the hair looks like
when it's wet so you guys aren't kind of
like misled thinking that you know the
patterns gonna stay the pattern actually
did stay though it's just a little bit
more kind of like spread out a little
bit compared to let's see if I could
find one hidden piece back here that's
still curly so for example this head
pease back hair is still in the two
ringlets style and obviously the front
is kind of loser I do like the loose
version of this just because it has more
of a realistic look I just put a little
bit of water and a little bit of argan
oil in the bottle and mix it together I
didn't use any of the curling cream
products just because I didn't feel like
this type of texture needed that I used
those products to Cantu products on
curly hair that's softer and that's like
a really light curl just because that
curly hair tends to frizz up more than
this does because this one has more of a
kinky texture when it frizz is it looks
more natural on soft curly hair when it
frizz is it just looks a mess so I use a
Cantu on kind of like light curly hair
for this one I didn't have to add
anything I think it just came perfect
it's very very nice guys it's 20 inches
long but obviously when it's in curl
form it stops like right above my
breasts I feel like stretch length it'll
come under my boobs but I'm not gonna
straighten this just because I like the
simplicity of the style and the whole
purpose of buying a unit that's curly is
to wear it curly
but I understand not everybody has money
to buy like multiple wigs so if you want
to strain I'm pretty sure that's trained
pretty fine now this is a 360 unit guys
so you get about 4 party 4 inches of
parting space in the front and two in
the back so if you want to do like a
high bun high ponytails you can do
whatever you want so guys I will leave
all the information down below if you're
interested in purchasing this baby or
any other baby from this website I will
link the last video I did on their yaki
straight wig somewhere up here for you
guys if you guys want to check that out
that video is very detailed and very
descriptive when it came to kind of like
styling the wig putting it down baby

the link up here for you guys now guys
