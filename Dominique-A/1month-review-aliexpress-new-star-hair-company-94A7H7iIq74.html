just to do a quick one month review on
my hair and this is the hair that I got
from this start hair company and this is
the virgin brazilian body wave hair if
you watched my previous video I told you
everything you need to know about the
hair but I will go over it again for
those that didn't watch it just to save
you some time
this hair is I bought three bundles and
it came out to 100 well actually got
four bundles I gave one to my sister and
these four bundles came out to one
hundred and eighty-seven dollars and
fifteen cents I believe and four bundles
I got four tenets for my sister 20 inch
for me 22 inch and 24 inch the longest
length is at the bottom and it comes
right about my bellybutton little pass
and it could kind of touch almost near
my backside which is pretty good and the
the bun though the size of the weft of
the hair was actually a lot I got a lot
of hair all the bundles were able to fit
in my head and I also have a closure at
the top which I got from javelina here
calm heavenly hair calm and this was a
14 inch closer which I layer it up and
stuff like that and this all this hair
is a virgin hair so this closure was
actually virgin brazilian body wave hair
and also and I had this culture for
about two years and I absolutely love
this closure it took me a while to kind
of figure the closure out but once I was
able to figure the closure out I was
able to style it the way I wanted to
style it and this is I spent about $150
on this closure and I kind of regret it
I don't regret it because it's good but
I gotta got something for a weight
cheaper but it is what it is I'm gonna
rock this bad boy out
and I actually think I'm pretty it looks
pretty good to me I'm not sure me I'm
not a professional so I think it looks
pretty damn realistic to me like it
really does to me and people are like oh
what is that you know some people acting
all nosy up in my hair
but anyways but here does a difference
so what I did do to the hair is I did
dye the hair and I went out to Sally's
Beauty Supply and I bought myself some
developer and some stuff and I got the
40 developer and this was on sale so I
got their salon carré the salon care 1
and this was $10 so this whole jug right
here it was on sale so I bought a big
container because I
rather just by the big jumbo pack
instead of going back and forth and
doing all that mess because those little
packets they might not so fast and I got
this so this is my like 12 bucks I got
13 bucks was just a good deal I foiled
the hair off I left this one about for
like about 15 minutes of color man like
this and even the closure itself too
because it's I you know I never had this
culture for a long time I never decided
to bleach the culture I used I used to
do a lot of won't bring my hair but this
is by far the best hombre that I ever
did I actually was gonna do a bit higher
like right up here but then I was like
oh no I might as well do like this like
a framing downwards my face and the
hombre is absolutely gorgeous it came
out so nice like I get so many
compliments some spots may look a bit
lighter but it's okay to me and I know
hombre seems like a kind of like a
summery look well not for me I like I
don't I just like the color for for any
time it depends on the way you style
yourself and the way you style your hair
so for me the own Brad she worked for
the winter is actually gonna work for
the winter time for me too so I actually
went off and did it so this is a hombre
it's like there's a lot of like blonde
colors and stuff like that everywhere
and the tips are a bit blonder in the
light so if you want to I mean I could
take pictures or go on my Instagram and
see all the pictures I post stuff
because I have a thousand pictures but
the hair and slider towards the ends but
it's pretty good the hair the sparks
tangling I really don't get that much
tangling with this hair shedding I get
shedding but the shedding is breaking
off from the ends the hair actually got
shorter in length because the hair
breaks off at the end not even for the
fact that I bleached her hair it's like
before I bleached it here when the hair
was just natural color the hair was she
was actually shedding off from the ends
which was I was like shocked I was like
why is it like tipping off like this but
I mean I guess it was taking off all the
nasty ends I'm not sure but the hair is
still good I actually really like this
hair this hair
everybody's complimenting me they're
like oh my god you hear so gorgeous it's
um and it's very thick it's not even
Chinese hair supposed to be really thick
this is not Chinese hair and this hair
is like pretty thick and pretty and I
love it and I know you guys are gonna
ask me what is this pattern I have it
right now and I'm pretty sure most of
you guys already know but I
in a couple minutes the hair after I
bleached it dryness not at all even
after I boots it here and I wash my hair
and I blow dried it I freaking love it
was like some it was like nice and
thinking beautiful and then now it
doesn't it has the end zone even look
dead to me I honestly don't think that
the ends look that bad the ends do not
look bad at all to me I actually think
they look really good so that's a plus
cuz the bleaching did not hurt my hair
at all it didn't dry the ends out
nothing not to me it looks absolutely
the hair looks the same to me
I actually really like to hear you guys
continue for yourself the hair is still
looking rather gorge and I only showed
you guys showed you guys the hair when I
took it out the package so this is what
it looks like after a month like this is
really good here and even after
bleaching the hair it's still good the
only thing I would complain about is
just the hair how much how it kind of
breaks off at the ends any kind of you
kind of lose the length of the hair I
kind of lost the length a little bit but
I still have the length that I you know
that's satisfying me you know cuz I paid
for it so I mean it's okay I mean I
still have some length so I'm pretty
happy about that
but other than that the hair is just
it's good I like it what I buy from this
place again yeah probably I'd have to
talk to the vendor you know kind of you
know discuss stuff to him you know try
to you know get him to try to talk to
him about is the quality of the air the
shipping was fast like I said before was
like maybe three days not even he came
in like that I probably talked to the
vendor about you know fixing the hair
you know talking about the problem that
I'm having with the hair thus far but
other than that the hair is really good
I really like it and that's about it
guys
I will update you guys again and I am
going to tell you guys what I use for
the hair um so that I could protect the
hair from drying you guys know that I
use my garden a few T's products and
this is a blow drying protecting my hair
and this right here is for Flatiron and
protect you but I also use it when I do
my hair in this stuff
so this saw that I'm rocking right now
is a crimp style I have this crimper
right here and this is pro beauty tools
just like a deep waver deep crimp or
whatever and it only has settings on
high high and low and it's on and off by
right here and this I bought this for
about maybe twenty dollars at Walmart I
had an embed had one from before but it
broke on me I spent about fifty dollars
on this one this one was twenty dollars
it does the same thing and it gives you
this like wavy looking a fact right here
which I freakin absolutely love I like
absolutely love this and it's like it's
like if you don't want to wave your hair
up this is probably like the most
affordable way I'm gonna show you guys
what it looks like I'm gonna turn it on
so I could show you guys what it looks
like okay okay so I turned it on and I'm
gonna show you guys what one section off
a piece of my hair to show you guys what
an actual wave looks like so from the
back you get like a piece in the back
any random piece I just just spray it
with a little heat protect it and I put
my zone high because I don't have time
to waste forever here we take a long
time for me to do I'm trying to be in
and out you know what I'm saying
so this is a crimper we're gonna put it
off it's not really it's not like an
important way to do it it's just like
you stick the hair on and you call it
damn day that's how I feel
I'm peace just a hair is a bit wavy
already and be like kind of weird
making funny faces guys so bear with me
hey though and it just gives you like
this pretty like ol SHINee wave like
that so I absolutely love this crimper
and if you guys go out to anyone where
our Hartman's beauty supply store or
even Sally's you guys can find these
cool things instead of wetting your hair
in the morning you want to go for a
beachy wave this is what you go for and
I actually really love this product
right here then I would suggest all you
guys buy it so thank you guys for
