with a two week post-op video for my
breast augmentation I would have come to
you guys earlier but I had so many
things to do and I actually wanted to
make sure that my recovery was great and
to actually want to spend but um
honestly I'm absolutely happy with the
results I can't believe that I actually
went through with this and like I told
you guys before my other videos I've
been planning for this procedure for a
long time and I'm so happy that I got it
out the way and that it was a very
successful surgery I also want to thank
my doctor dr. Greenwald he's amazing and
I am going to in front of the post-op
visit in a couple days from now so I
will update you guys more about the
post-op visit but I will tell you guys
now what I'm doing with my breasts and
how everything went so basically my
procedure was January 15 2015 which
marks that one week ago this week makes
it to week and yeah it's been a it's
been a great ride the procedure went
perfectly find legit I was I was my
procedure is actually a little bit
behind time it was supposed to be
scheduled at 9:50 I actually wouldn't at
10:30 and I actually walked to the to
the Akbar and that basically said I'm on
the bed and they hooked me up I'm
laughing with the anesthesiologist ten
seconds later I'm like knocked out and
like 15 seconds later I'm up and I
realized that the whole thing tire thing
is over and I'm like looking down I'm
looking at oh my god I got boobs guys
like it was one of the fastest
procedures and I've never had a surgical
procedure ever not cosmetic or not like
palliative or anything like that it was
just like it was the first time I read a
surgery and it was like the fastest
surgery I've ever had but you know
you're living in a transmitter on when
you're on anesthesia so it's that kind
of like it feels too it feels like it's
very quick but it's not really quick so
yeah but um it was it was it was it was
great when I left I got home I was fine
I was laughing my friends they all came
to see me we're just hanging out at the
house and it was okay I went to sleep
and I
but my back and I slept with three
pillows elevated which was it was okay
it was comfortable I didn't really have
any problems with that I slept the whole
night and made sure I set my alarm clock
so I I was supposed to take my pain
medication and before hours PRN so I was
taking it every four hours I remember I
would wake me up and I would take my
pill cells on top of it I only had one
bad experience one night when I woke up
and like my chest was on fire like I
don't even it was maybe three day three
post-op oh my gosh guys my chest was
hurting so bad and I'm like how come
it's hurting right now like I'm on top
of the pills and everything lights up of
my chest I that night I couldn't tell
you I I legit was like I woke my mom I
was like oh my god please give me a pill
right now and like honestly when you
take pills like that it kicks in like
this so like two seconds later I was
right back to sleep the pills do kind of
make you drowsy so it does kind of give
you like this this euphoria it kind of
like feeling like it's like you're
floating kind of so it does keep it
makes you really drowsy as well too but
it works very fast so I took the pill
and I legit went to sleep like this with
no pain and that was only one night that
I felt pain it actually people will tell
you like before you get to surgery that
it feels like an elephant sitting on
your chest I guess I don't know what an
elephant feels like sitting on my chest
so I would assume that that's the
feeling but it's just really really
tight like your skin it's like your skin
is stretched so it's like really really
tight um
but honestly after I went to my left to
my first post-op visit which was a week
later it like that tightness that like
feel that stretchy skin look that
tightness was like completely gone like
it was like on so um now after after all
that like honestly on a scale of one to
ten the payload was about a three and
I'm not even joking with you guys I
stopped taking the pain pills maybe like
five days after the surgery like I was
like okay I'm done with these pills like
I still had pills laughs and I was like
fine I'm gonna like I just don't like
the way that any like the way the pills
made me feel a really strong narcotics
and they make you feel like I felt so
weird taking the pills I didn't like the
way I was feeling and I felt like
was enabled to do things more because I
was so drugged up so I cut those bad
boys out of the picture like very fast
so for my post-op visit I went to see my
doctor and basically he looked at it he
looked at my breasts and he decided to
start me on the medial massage and
basically what medium-sized means he and
he'd say this to me and I was absolutely
stunned when he did this because like
I'm sitting there laughing I'm talking
then he just takes his hands he puts
them like this and he just pushes my
breasts together and mind you bear at
bay I haven't touched I didn't even put
my hands on him for days like I wasn't
touching them or anything like that
he quickly takes his hand just like Rams
them together I'm like ah like legit
like that shit hurt my son the face
expression I made was priceless like I
couldn't even believe he did that but
like I guess it's uni they basically
want you to do that the beginning
because they want you to stretch out
those muscle fibers so that the breasts
can come together and be sisterly so
that's why they want you to do that and
he's making me do it too two times a day
like 10 to 15 times and he wants you to
hold the breasts together for 10 seconds
and then release it so that the cleavage
can be more defined as you guys can tell
now my breast implants are absolutely
high to the roof they have not dropped
yet and my doctor's making me go back in
like 10 days because he wants to see
what we're gonna do now because the
breasts have not dropped the breast
implants are high this one's higher
because I'm I can tell us higher because
I can feel all the way to my armpit
right here so this breast implant is
very very high
this one not so much this one is a
little bit more more low I will show you
guys if the boobs look like full of you
this as much as I'm gonna show you
because I don't want anybody reporting
my video and saying I'm showing you guys
too much but did I want to give you guys
a good view of with poo so clay like I
said this is a 400cc implant and these
are saline implants behind the muscle so
the breast implant is alway apparent
like I said to you guys before so once
this drops the breath
level come a little bit bigger when I
did go in right before the procedure he
warned meteos I'm telling you right now
they're gonna be big and I'm like okay
whatever I don't care like right before
when I was like I want the big I don't
care
but whatever you big I mean big
proportionate to my size I don't be like
Triple D breasts small D breasts as well
what it's actually gonna look like once
I get size and all and that's what I
want I don't want it look to look very
large and natural but I felt like this
is us so let me just do this quickly I
feel so awkward standing like this so
this is what the boob looks like this is
what this side of you of the breast
implant looks like guys and this is just
what it looks like now like I said the
implant is still high up in the up in
the collarbone area right here
once it does drop down to the SAC it
will come out more and be more of a
fuller looking breast but for now it
looks so so hot okay so this is the
beginning like I said now that I'm doing
that video massage I can see the breast
implant kind of making its form and is
actually moving closer together and the
more do this massage will make it look
more natural and it'll sit better when I
really like tops without like Brahmas
tops and open topless blonde B's you
don't I mean guys I will post a picture
or I will actually do outfits showing
you guys what my breasts look like with
my breasts and please let me closer so
far this is what it looks like it I hope
I'm not showing you guys any Nick if I
have a nip slip sorry guys but this is
what it looks like and yeah so I'm very
very happy with the results he did a
wonderful job and like I said I linked
his information down below he's a great
doctor and if I love anything out guys
sorry I'll probably try to give you guys
some more information another video for
another update we're gonna do one month
update next because I just want you two
guys to see the progression with the
breast but other than that I'm very
happy with the results so far like I
said I already knew that I was gonna
take three to six months with a boobs to
look the way that I want them fill up
but for now this is okay I did plan
purposely to give them done in January
so that when May or June comes that
they'll be perfect because by then it'll
be five to six months and they should
kind of be settling down
to be so yeah so that wraps up my video
guys thumbs up this video guys if you
guys like it and I will come back with
the one my one month update on my breast
augmentation then you guys are all my
new subscribers and my supporters I love
you guys so much and I'll catch you guys
