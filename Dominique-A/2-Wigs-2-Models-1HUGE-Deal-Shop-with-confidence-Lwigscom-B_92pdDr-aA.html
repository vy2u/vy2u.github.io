for today and basically you guys saw the
wig in the beginning so the base is
basically the wig only had like a little
bit of parting space at the like kind of
the nape area well this is the name not
the name pad it has a little bit of part
right where the middle part was that you
could dip your head and see it so
basically all I did was just add powder
to like I regular would do and then it
was 18 inches long so I basically just
cut the hair you can so I basically just
like cut the hair cuz I didn't like the
way that it was styled it was kind of
boring and flat so I basically cut it
like at a weird choppy Bob and
surprisingly I did a good job cutting it
like it's like a blunt cut and I just
added some curls too just to make it
look more fun and it gives it more
volume instead of being kind of straight
and flat with the 18 inch so that didn't
work so I consider this hairstyle kind
of like one of those hairstyles for
someone that doesn't really know how to
do too much baby ears and doesn't have
time to kind of make the hair look too
realistic around the perimeter like this
unit that one you just have a basic
middle part you just style it curl it or
do whatever you want to to just put it
on and go out the door so this is one of
those simple units you can get and you
can just rock it so what do you think I
love it you know I'm bald so every time
I get some hair I don't know how to act
yeah it's nice and lightweight not too
heavy yeah so she doesn't have here
obviously you guys saw in the beginning
she got no hair so these kind of wigs
will are just quick wigs just to put on
his style and like I said if you're not
a baby hair type of person this units
gonna work for you because it's just
boom bang done so I definitely like it
does the cut style so if you ordered
this unit I recommend ordering in this
12 inch or a 14 inch and then going
about your business with it if you want
to cut it like this I think this is a
nice cut I'm not professional guys so I
basically just went boom with the
scissors and that was I am professional
and it's not bad cut it all should be a
job it's even that basically wraps it up
for today's transformation Tuesday I
don't do transformation Tuesday's every
Tuesday but I've been rolling some out
for the last two weeks so I hope that
