hi guys so today I'm coming david today
with the beauties favorite video i've
never done a beauty's favor but today i
decided to try something different on my
youtube channel for you guys because it
is 2015 and i'm trying to improve my
channel a lot so um yeah so we're gonna
do beauty favorites I've got a couple of
items here that I want to show you guys
I'm not going to get too crazy on the
items I'm pretty sure everyone does
beauty favorites videos on YouTube side
I want to bore you guys with the simple
things in life so i'll just show you
guys a couple things and do things that
I've got so we'll start off with this
this is a Mac prep and prime I got this
for Christmas I requested this from one
of my friends who is a cosmetologist so
she did get this from me and this is
basically a natural radiance space
luminaire and it biscay is a primer I
love it I put on anyone into a couple
squirts of it in the morning i blathered
on my face with my moisturizer and I
start my foundation it helps the makeup
stay longer and it does give your face
an extra glow which I love the next
thing that is one of my favorite items
is the Revlon Colorstay 24-hour makeup
and this is for the combination oily
skin I have oily skin I'm always oily in
the t-zone areas i was using milk of
magnesia for a long time but I start
because it dried out because I love to
top off but yeah so this is the 1 i'm
using now and if this is the color
cappuccino this isn't on for ten
cappuccino and this looks like you can
get this from any drugstore this is one
of my favorite foundation so this is
probably the only foundation that i
actually use until I find something else
that's comparable to this product but
for now this is one of my absolute
favorites I love this foundation it has
the best coverage and it is absolutely
beautiful and it blends well with my
skin the next thing i want to show you
guys with a couple of brow kits I used
to pencil my brows and like back then
you know back in the old days but now I
decided to start doing again the powder
I use doing the pattern when i first
started and then I started going into
doing the pencil but I decided to start
the powder again so this is the man
milani bra fig sprocket and this is what
it looks like it comes like this you can
usually get these from CVS or any
drugstore
one right here has a fork I has three
things as a highlight has a brown one
bra too as you can top and digging into
this one right here because that is my
color and i've been using that one of my
brows I don't really want dark eyebrows
when I'm trying to go for a lighter
eyebrow looks so therefore the second
the second color is so when I use and
this is excellent product i love this
one i also use that in combination with
the elf brow kit this is the elf bracket
that's like three bucks and I as you can
type in using this one this is way too
light for me so I use this one and this
is a gel side so the gel what is pretty
good it's a good consistency of you use
a great angle brush and you put it on
your eyebrows it does very very well um
and these are very inexpensive guys so I
do going between using both of these
right here just because I can do a
powder base first or I can do a
gel-based person into the powder to cope
with the topic so I'll go it'll go
either way with these two but I
absolutely love these um it is giving me
the cheap above look of nice natural
brows which I love some two things i
want to show you it's been like a crazed
i've been using this for you or maybe
like the year now is a la pro concealers
I having two cards i have toffee and i
have fun everyone's been doing reviews
on these ideas product i absolutely love
these products they're very good
products they're great concealers have
good consistency I think they're
comparable to the mac concealers i'm not
sure i've never used mac conceals but
i've heard that they're comparable to
those concealers but these two computers
are excellent they work for all
different 2 out for every different type
of woman out there all shades anyone can
use these they have variety of colors
these are the two that i use for a nice
highlight underneath my eye it's a
conceal some dark spots so this is the
two cause i use i mostly use the phone
cause you guys can tell because I've
done sucked the life out of this one and
this is a newer one that just picked up
I km and if you go in I can't house I
believe they're two thousand fifty cents
and the shipping is 3,000 ninety-five
cents so you can check out on Kate house
they have a whole bunch of colors and
varieties of these so these are my
things and I'm going to show you guys
some NYX products I'm in love with the
NYX soft matte lip cream
I've been obsessed with them for years
and years and years they're the best lip
stick or Matt it's kind of like a it is
a lipstick it's just like a cream
lipstick and it's matt my favorite
favorite one is canes and this is the
one I've been using and as you can tell
my lips today this is the one half on my
lips today and it's absolutely gorgeous
I did combine it with the other colors
to make it look like very mad and pretty
kind of like that Kylie Jenner color
look little to every was going for but
this is how I try to achieve that look
today I hope it came out pretty well
guys i mean i'm up over the whole face
look today but the lip portion of my
mouth it's kind of like a mafia color
and this is what it looks like and this
is a color canes the next one i have is
a really really kind of nude color and
this one is london and london is a
really really nude color i usually use
the london right in the middle of my
lips just to give it more of an expanded
pop on my lips so yeah if you guys are
interested in this makeup look just
leave it down below just leave your
comments down below for this makeup look
like i said i am trying to expand my
youtube channel this year so these are
my two favorite go-to lip colors for the
season right now and like I said it from
nicks and there's a soft matte lip cream
i'll list at down below for you guys to
other lip pencils i love from nyx is
mahogany which is a SPL 809 and it's
just a lip liner and crayon I will
actually put this on my hand than the up
it's like a really nice color and like i
said i've been into that mommy look this
is kind of like a deep mom look for a
woman of darker skin complexions i
really love this color guys it is so
pretty and this is about i bought this
on black cyber monday souls like maybe
two bucks the other call that i've been
loving is mauve and this is the number 8
31 like I said guys if I am talking too
fast or if I forget to mention the knit
the color or the name of the product I
will sit down below for you guys so this
is the mob color and like I said it's a
really nice colorful win of calm darker
skin complexion and not only woman with
darker skin complexion it could go for
anyone this is a really pretty color and
I'm into these colors for the season
they're very nice rich and beautiful so
these are my two favorite go tues for
the season guys um yeah and the one
thing I've been using a lot is this
beauty blender and it's looking crazy
right now because I've been using it a
lot now probably should consider
cleaning it if you can clean these i'm
not sure but if someone knows how you
clean these products just leave a
comment down below and tell me but this
is a video and i've been using i got
this from TJ maxx i really like this one
cuz the precision on this one right here
is very sharp so therefore when you're
doing your concealer you can get right
into the middle you could get right into
the teared up right here to really get a
good finish on your life on your
concealer and i use this a lot on my
face as you can tell but you know spot
like three or four bucks and i really
love this beauty blender the next
product I have is this elf kind of like
it's a pressed powder but I use this as
a contour powder and this isn't the
color toffee this is a color that it
looks like it's very deep and rich and I
use this as a contour on my face
suggested tell really chiseled today so
I use this as a contour palette I really
love it's a nice dark rich color and
it's in the color toffee and this is
about maybe like a dollar or three
dollars so i really love this product
the next thing i want to show you guys
is the NYX matte finish spray and I love
this it is a matte finish so therefore
you spray your face off your makeup is
done or before your makeup and it gives
you a nice golden nice rich finish so i
absolutely love this product and I use
this like religiously the last two
things I want to show you guys are these
beautiful ben nye powders that i use for
my setting and these are the patterns of
the container looks absolutely girls
because it's mixed in all my makeup
products but this is topaz pet bed night
till pass and this one has been nice
sienna i do combine these sliders
together with the letter translucent
powder to get the setter to set my
makeup i don't know if you guys can tell
but i set my makeup underneath my eyes
and maybe somewhere as you guys can tell
very oily in this area right here so i
do try to powder this up a lot during
the days just because it looks crazy but
these are the two products that i used
as a setting powder for my face i
absolutely love these products is about
seven bucks very inexpensive and it does
the job
so yeah so if you guys are interested in
any of these products I am sure you guys
of my beauty favorites just leave your
comments down below I will list all the
items down below for you guys and um
