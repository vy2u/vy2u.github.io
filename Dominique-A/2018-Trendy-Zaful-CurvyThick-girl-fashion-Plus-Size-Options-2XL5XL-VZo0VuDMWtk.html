today with another Kirby slash stick
girl trying to haul video so today's
video guys is sponsored by a fool.com so
I've worked with Zack Volcom previously
like maybe three or four times I did a
lot of baiting sue hauls in the summer
with them and I've just recently been
doing clothing howes with them as well
too so today I'm going to show you guys
some clothes I selected from the website
now some of the clothes that I chose
were from the plus-size section and some
are from the regular size section it's
kind of tricky when you're shopping on
Asian based websites just because it'll
tell you it's a plus size and will come
out being either way too big or way too
small so guys I will leave all the
information down below in regards to the
items I have to show you guys in today's
video I hope you guys like this video I
definitely like a lot of the items that
I got some items that I did like I will
point them out to you real quick so guys
if you're interested in seeing what I
have to offer in today's tron huh I
would like you to stay tuned and keep
online all right guys before I even get
like crazy into this video the hair that
I'm wearing is a custom unit that I
created and the hair was provided from
vertical hair company so now you guys
gonna ask me that initially before I
even like start the video go down as a
comment
so this hairs from vertical hair company
and I made a wings on a mesh dome cap
and I did four bundles in a frontal I
absolutely am in love with this unit I
think it looks really good really
natural and the length is SuperDuper
long and super super sexy so I've never
been rocking it in a lot of my recent
videos so if you noticed that's what the
hair is and I will leave that hair link
up here for you guys so just click that
and you guys will see the review and
I'll also leave the video down below if
you're not that savvy and clicking that
button so on to the hall right guys so
I'm gonna jump right into the video I'm
gonna show you guys a few things that I
really liked I liked a lot of this stuff
but I know what I'm saying that but
these are the things that I actually
really really liked so the first thing
that I got is this really cute leather
skirt now my last channel hallward's
Apfel they did send me a skirt that I
didn't asked for so it was really nice
but it was a little too tight and I went
to go see if they have a skirt again in
a bigger size but the size that I got
evidently was the largest size so I'm
gonna show you guys this one I got from
the plus-sized section and this one I
believe is a size us 16 in the UK 20 now
like I said I'm really really skeptical
when it comes to shopping on these
websites because when you buy size is a
good thing you're gonna fit they
actually
fit so this one actually fit but it was
a little bit too big so I can I got a
size six a size 14 u.s. or size 12 u.s.
and I'm usually like a US 12 or US 10 it
depends on the stretch and all that kind
of stuff but I'm a pretty fluffy type of
girl so it depends I like the stretch of
the materia and stuff like that so it's
just something like I'm just kind of
used to now this skirt is really cute
when I first got it I put it like the
wrong direction in the beginning I
didn't know if it was supposed to be
kind of like an angle style skirt so
when I initially tried it on it was the
the angled part was like in the middle
and I'm like no that's not the way it
goes so the skirt was actually really
big on me so I can actually move it and
I can actually jump into it without even
zipping it up so it was kind of like one
of those things like I wish it had like
a belt area or something like that just
because it was a little too big and I
wanted to find ways to kind of wear but
I do like the skirt guys so what I ended
up doing was taking a plaid shirt and
tying the plaid shirt around my waist
adding the plaid shirt definitely was
kind of like a mixed texture with the
skirt it just kind of gave more of a
rebel look more of kind of like a metal
clean-cut look which I like so I added
the plaid shirt on my waist with a nice
great gray top and I absolutely love
that outfit I thought the outfit was
really cute and that's kind of like
going back to your basic type of outfits
kind of putting like a really nice
designer style skirt like I don't know
if this is designer but a skirt that has
a lot of design on it with kind of like
different patterns like plaid shirt and
kind of like a rugged gray a t-shirt
long sleeve so I thought that outfit
idea was really nice I really when I try
that on I was like yes this is me like I
used to wear my opposite that all the
time but the winter right now is
absolutely freezing like I don't even
know what I'm gonna be able to wear some
of these outfits I probably have to wait
till March or kind of like early April
when it's kind of like 60 degrees to
wear these outfits right now in the East
Coast
it's frigid I live in Connecticut and if
you live in New York we're feeling the
same type of winds like it is super
super cold so I'm kind of like really
like anticipating the the moment where I
can actually wear these outfits because
I really like everything in combination
but it's just too cold outside to
experience any of the any of these looks
honestly now the next thing that I got
is it's really really cute dress guys
and I was kind of thinking about wearing
this for Valentine's Day
now I actually might wear this for
Valentine's Day and puts
stockings on with it now this dress is a
sweater dress and initially when I saw
it on the website I was sure I was a
little bit scared I knew that was gonna
be a sweater material so I had like a
great probability of it being stretchy
which I was a lucky so this dress is a
size extra-large now extra large in my
mind is gonna be a nice fitted dress
it's not gonna be tight it's gonna be a
great fitted dress but like I said with
these websites you got to be careful
because you're thinking oh it's gonna be
extra-large described like a u.s.
extra-large
it's never a u.s. extra large guys is
always gonna be like a tiny a china base
or like an Asian base extra-large so you
have to keep that in mind a lot of
people say measure before you buy from
these websites while honestly I'm gonna
be realistic with you guys I don't have
time to measure so I I don't really
think that everyone else is gonna have
that much time to measure it's not I
don't know like I just want the time of
my day to go ahead and measure myself
honestly and truly but for you guys I
will so that might be something I'm
going to consider but as far as
purchasing these clothes I'm not gonna
go and measure myself I'm honestly just
gonna wing it and if it doesn't work I'm
gonna return it but maybe don't take my
word of advice maybe you guys should
just go ahead and try it and we'll test
yourselves out or measure yourselves
before purchasing it but I kind of feel
like since it's a sweater material
I read the material and if the material
seemed like a material that was
qualified to be stretchy I automatically
went and purchased it so this dress guys
is really it's actually stretching I'm
not gonna lie the only thing with this
dress is if you're curvier you're
definitely gonna have a shorter length
type of dress now if you had like a flat
body with no curves no button nothing
like that obviously the dress is gonna
fit nice it's not gonna it's not gonna
be a short but because I do have a
little bit of hills and dips to go
through and nooks and crannies to go
over it definitely had to lose some
length so the best part about this dress
guys is the sleeves the sleeves to me
are amazing very romantic very floral
very pretty it is a see-through sleeve
guys and it also has kind of like that
kind of like a sweatshirt type of end on
the wrist which is tight the sweatshirt
materials the sweater the dress itself
the material is very nice it's not
see-through it's a really good material
I did wear full-body Spanx with this one
just because I wanted to get the real
grip on I thought it was really nice
it's something I would definitely say
wear with stockings just because it's a
little bit shorter and because it is
still winter and if you're planning on
wearing something like this for
Valentine's Day you definitely want to
make sure you're a little bit warm
putting stockings on within some nice
little boots would be really cute so I
thought that this was really cute and I
might even do like a get ready with me
video for Valentine's Day and do like
hair makeup and this outfit in corporate
and like in combination so definitely
look out for that that might actually
happen so the next dress that I got is a
really cute dress I love skater style
dresses or shift style dresses I think
those dresses definitely give your body
a nice natural womaning look so I picked
this one off on the website and it's
really really cute guys so I got this
one in a u.s. size 14 and like I said
this is from the plus-size section it
has a beautiful kind of like a v-neck
Club cleavage area but this one is not
like a fashion oval and this one is very
sexy very adult very nice I just like
the way the construct of the dress the
dress also has like cold shoulders or
cold arms I'll call this one because it
actually opens where the elbows that on
the side of the lateral side of your arm
I thought that this was really nice it
has like a tie on the bottom and the
best part like I said about this dress
is that the cut in the dress is not like
too sexy it's very nice and elegant and
it's not something that's going to take
too much attention from the actual dress
itself it is a bit short like I said
with this if you are curvier you're
gonna get like a shorter length style
dress but what I would recommend with
this type of dress again guys is to wear
stockings and some nice booties I think
that would look really nice it does come
with a little wrap for the to wrap
around your belt so it's kind of like a
shift dress that you can wrap around
your breast or wrap dress oh my god
wrap dress that's what it is guys wrap
dress so it comes with like a little
belt and you just wrap it around your
waist and try to stand kind of set
yourself in so I thought the dress is
really nice guys very simple black as
usual and I honestly I'm gonna be a
haunt honest with you guys a lot of the
stuff from this website is actually
black so it's kind of like a bummer I
don't know if it's it's just something
that I like I saw I didn't purposely do
it but when I went on the website I was
clicking the black stuff like ooh this
is cute this is cute when I got the
package in the mail I'm like yo why did
I pick all this black stuff so I
definitely
black stuff for this haul but the stuff
is really really pretty guys and I don't
know I just really like those three
items the first three items I show you
guys but I do have some more to show you
guys so justjust stay just wait alright
guys so I'm gonna show you three tops
that I really like this one too now I've
been into that kind of trend where it's
kind of like those exaggerated sleeves
type of tops I think that's a really
cute trend that's been going on so on
the website I think I got this in the
plus-size section or maybe I've got it
in the regular size section but let me
unravel the shirt I can actually show
you guys it and tell you guys the size
now like I said I've been really
impressed and really really kind of like
trying to hop on the trend with these
kind of like extravagant sleeve type of
tops a lot of them are kind of like wide
arm sleeves
I don't really call it the fanned out
sleeves I don't know so this is what it
looks like guys it's kind of like this
kind of like three layered folded type
of sleeve now definitely has kind of
like that funny like material sound or
whatever but I thought it was cute just
because the top was kind of like a
turtleneck top now this is a size large
so I'm assuming that this is from the
regular section but I do like the whole
contrast of the black and the blue
initially when I saw I thought that the
shirt was just completely um was
completely black and the sleeves are
black as well but they did put these
Navy sleeves on it which kind of threw
me up a little bit in the beginning but
then I was like okay they're trying to
add like a little bit of a collar block
not really but they're trying to add
like a little bit of a color kind of mix
in it or they probably ran out of
material I don't know but I thought it
was cute it's definitely very
fashionable with jeans they're kind of
like little boots or booties or whatever
I just thought it was really cute and
I've never had a type of top like this
so I wanted to kind of get one so I
could be part of the crew kind of like
there's been this whole trend going on
so I definitely want to try it out I
think that this is a nice top that you
don't have to go extra strap extravagant
with the rest of your outfit because
this part of the Alpha is definite gonna
be the showstopper so I thought that
this was really cute now the next type I
got is kind of like an off-the-shoulder
now I'm really funny because I say this
to my sister my friends all the time
like what's the point of wearing off the
shoulder top in the wintertime when
you're gonna have a jacket on so
honestly and truly I thought this is Q
on the website so I picked it out but I
honestly would have wear this until like
March or April
or even like May because I'm not gonna
be exposing my bare shoulders out in the
freezing cold right now so I was like
you know I don't care I like the shirt I
love gray tops I love the great colors
it's just something about it is just
really this my thing so I got this one
under size extra-large now first of all
I'm gonna tell you that the material is
kind of funny like the material is kind
of like it wants to be a sweater
material but it's not a sweater material
it's like a nice gray color and
obviously it starting to wash me the
heck on out so it's a gray material and
it's kind of like a peplum style off the
shoulder to dust shirt the thing I like
about is a material it's kind of itchy
but it's really soft and it's not the
type of sweater material that's gonna be
really hot or sticky in so that's one
thing that I like because it's a little
bit thinner than usual which is why I
wouldn't wear in the winter time just
because it would defeat the purpose of
wearing a sweater it's just way too cold
to wear something like this with
off-the-shoulder look but I thought it
was cute because it came with like a
little belt that you could tie around
your waist which is it's part of its
combination with the video with the
outfit so it's like an off-the-shoulder
peplum style shirt and you just tie like
the little grey belt around your waist I
thought it was cute I just felt like the
belt was a little bit short I wish the
belt was like a little bit longer so I
could make like a nice bow tie on the
front of it but that's that I mean like
honestly it's a really simple shirt you
can wear with leggings and high
over-the-knee boots or kind of just like
any style type of shoe I just thought it
was really nice simple but like I said
again it's something that I would wear
when I can actually expose my arms to
the air I would anywhere and now when
it's like 10 degrees outside of wear it
wait till it's like 60 degrees 65
degrees but I thought it was a really
cute top so I picked it out now the last
kind of I don't even know if this is the
last top I think I have another top but
this is one of the tops that I really
liked as well too now it's funny because
this one definitely says Zara inside so
I don't know if they if they're
partnered with Zara
which they probably aren't but we're
just going to disregard that but this is
it's actually says this from Zara and
it's a size us large now I love this top
and I think I've seen a lot of these
trends like trending trends trending Wow
turns trending dumb get it together son
so it's kind of part of one of the
trends now it's like a sweat it's like
the sweater trend or like any type of
trend a shirt what
like the pearls beads on it no I don't
like wearing beet pearls personally I
don't wear pearl earrings I just kind of
feel like it doesn't go with my look I
know that's kind of weird but it's just
not my style so I don't wear pearl
earrings I don't think I've ever wear
like pro earrings outside I don't think
that's my style but the sweater is cute
though so it's a crop top sweater and
honestly I have to find some type of
pants to wear with this like this if I
had like if I had like some wide leg
kind of like dress pants or something
like real slouchy I'd wear with it but I
don't really have anything not to wear
that so I just paired with some jeans
disregard the jeans because I never
would wear this with those types of
jeans but I thought this was really cute
guys it's really nice has like these
nice pearls stuck on it I kind of want
to pull one of the pros out to see if
they come off but as my effect they
actually like sewed the pearls on which
is kind of weird but I think that this
is really cute it's a crop top style umm
sweater it's really cute
I would actually wear this one but kind
of like some type of like palazzo pants
and wide leg pants I wear this with like
a little blazer on top or a leather
jacket on top and just out like that I
really thought that this was really cute
guys it's a very nice material it's a
little bit itchy with a lot of sweater
materials that kind of get really itchy
so this one's slightly itchy on the
itchy side but I feel like you know once
you got to wear it get used to you just
kind of get over it after a while so I
tell you that this was nice it's a size
large and it's really cute and it does
say it's from Zara Wow but yeah I
definitely thought that this was
definitely worth a and its really cute
alright guys so I'm kind of like -
outerwear style
items they're not really out of where
that just kind of like sweaters and kind
of like a blazer but it's not something
I'm gonna wear outside by itself just
because like I said to you guys
East Coast is like 2 degrees right now
so the first thing I'm going to show you
guys it's kind of like this grandpa
style sweater now initially when I
started the website it looked completely
different and like I said I'm
consistently looking on the websites to
make sure I find things that are going
to look similar to the picture or are
gonna give me a little bit of life that
I can manipulate with when I get this
one it's a little off so this one is a
size let's see if I can find the size
that would be the first part that would
be the great part to find but I don't
think I'm gonna be able find it
No so I will even down below and tell
you exactly the size or inch in in the
video I believe this is like a size
larger extra-large guys honestly so it's
kinda like this grandpa style sweater
it's kind of like a Bill Cosby style
sweater except it doesn't have like all
the patterns I thought that this was
cute just because I had envision wearing
it without like a t-shirt underneath and
just run with like a bra and kind of
like wearing jeans or kind of leggings
very simple with ugg boots I just had
that kind of invent I envisioned that in
my head but when I got this one the
sleeves stop about not even
three-quarters of a length it stopped
maybe like 7/8 of the length and even go
it even go anywhere like it didn't even
go all the way to the wrist it stopped
like really weird at a weird spot so
it's not 3/4 length it's just kind of
weird so I really wished it kind of
stopped all the way at the wrist it
didn't do that and just the structure of
it if it was a little bit longer and it
wasn't as short as it was presented us I
kind of feel it would have took it to
another level so there's kind of steps
to this whole making process of this I
just did not like I do like the color I
like the royal blue color I do like the
white blue and burgundy trim on the
collar and the arms as well I thought
that was really cute and classy very
simple very chic but then again like I
said guys they just didn't construct it
well enough for me to actually like grow
out my run to and Blake I love this so
much so I wish they would have kind of
considered the length of the arms and
the length of the actual UM sweater
itself length up and down wise just
because those are things that you want
to think about expressing with people
like if you have someone that's Apple
shape it's gonna be kind of weird pear
shape is gonna be weird and I'm a pear
shape like things like that I'm just
gonna be kind of weird so it's it's like
and you got to kind of consider like
what people would like who's gonna be
buying this item so I don't think they
put a lot of thought into creating this
so I don't know if I quite like it that
much enough to wear it like on a rag but
if I have nothing to wear it I need
something to put on to like run out the
house real quick to the post office I'll
probably wear this honestly now the next
thing that I got I actually really liked
it but I wish it was a little bit bigger
like I wish I was a little bit more like
oversized longer and thicker but I do
like and I definitely will wear it guys
just you guys saw that the outfit I just
kind of try to make myself like a little
Q alpha with it but I definitely like
this
gaius material I like it color wise in
the whole concept wise now this one I
definitely definitely guys would wear so
it's kind of like a it's a blazer and
are kind of like an outerwear style
jacket blazer I'm gonna call it a blaze
because it has no freaking belt on
button now it is a really nice mustard
color and you guys know I'm obsessed
with mustard colors now this one guys
it's super super cute it has a great
collar area the collared area is really
nice it does have two pockets in the
front so you can put your hands in it
you can put stuff in and try to be all
cute and jazzy and stuff like that now
this one is a size a large and it does
fit really nice but like I said I would
like it to be a little bit more
oversized so that's not kind of like a
form-fitted type of jacket oversteps
would have made it look a little bit
more edgy but it took it a little bit
further than what it is but other than
that I do like it it is very long so it
does give you like kind of like more of
a not like a completely put together
look it just gives you more of a feeling
a look so I definitely like this a lot
guys I love the color the mustard color
is definitely a good color to transition
from winter to spring and summer so I
definitely think it's one of those
things I'm definitely going to kind of
pick up when I have like a last-minute
place to go and I need to put something
on like I said I probably wouldn't wear
now but when it comes to the March and
April months I definitely will put this
out there and rock this one like crazy
alright guys so the last clothing item
that I'm gonna show you guys is this
cute kind of two-piece set now it's
really cute concept wise but it just did
not fit me the way I thought it was
going to fit me so I did get this one
from the plus-size section as well and I
thought it was pretty cute so I got the
pants I got the whole suit in a size 5
XL now I did this on purpose guys
because like I said I did not want to
take any chances so the bottom is in a 5
XL and the top is in a 4 XL now this is
a part where you almost regret that you
made that decision so the pants for me
they were kind of slouchy kind of big or
whatever like I said with these types of
websites you got to make sure you buy
stuff a little bit bigger because you
don't know if it's gonna fit now I kind
of feel like together this whole entire
two-piece set just did not work now I
definitely will keep the pants and rock
the pants with something else a
different top and you know it's funny
these pants are not that bad I think
this would look cute with the sweater
with the pearls and some flats so I
might consider
keeping these to wear with that as that
as an outfit just because I think that
would work
the pants are well done though they do
have pockets in the front it has a nice
stretchy band in the back and it just
has like a regular band in the front so
if you're not looking from the back
you're thinking that this is a nice
tailored type of kind of like what do
you call these pants culottes I guess a
culottes are like the culotte pants so
if you look at it from the front looks
like it's a nice tailored type of
culottes but when you see the back it's
kind of like oh I needed the stretch man
but no one's looking at the back if you
got a top to cover it some type of
blazer it's gonna definitely come
through really nice so I thought the
pants were nice now the top is a 4x
outer I thought the top was just too big
now I wish the top was a little bit more
crop top II I think it was a crop top if
the top was more crop top ish I think
that the crop top crop top style with
those pants would have worked way better
guys like if it was crop top it would
have worked way better I do like the
style the shirt though they do it does
have like this cute little design on the
sleeves I was like a little peplum on
the sleeve and that's kind of like a
little bit of a like a like funny trim
on the front that kind of did like their
own little design on the front but like
I said guys in combination with the
pants the outfit just was not giving me
their life that I desired but I think
separately if you wore the items
separately you can definitely pull off
two different looks so I'm probably
going to just do two different looks and
that work together so if you're ever in
term like encounter a situation like
that where the pants and the top don't
go together
you don't separate those items apart and
kind of make your own outfits with those
so I'm probably gonna make my own outfit
with each of these because I think it
would look better that way versus being
together it just didn't go the way I
wanted to go and it's a bummer about the
end of the day you can always fix that
by making your own outfit so that's one
thing to keep in to consider all right
guys so now obviously I'm doing this
acessories version of this video so I
already got the first one on so this hat
says vacation on it I hope these boats
are right because sometimes they'd be
mess and stuff like that up so let me
check it out so the first thing I guys
this cute little yellow hat I thought
that was cute so I'm definitely into
vacation season like like row soon I'm
going to Thailand in March and then I
have like a couple other trips planned
so it's gonna be like another year of
tripping like tripping like not tripping
the like trip
with my friends and my family and my man
so I'm definitely gonna do light
traveling this year so I thought this
hat was cute just so we're I know so
cliched to wear a hat saying vacation on
it but when I'm gonna run up the island
they don't know what I'm out there doing
but yeah so I thought it was cute it's
yellow and I do I don't have any yellow
hat so I just thought it was cute so I
picked this one out it says vacation it
did come in different colors like blue
or pink but I love yellow
I think yellow is just the best color to
combine with melanin so I'm just like
yes so I thought it was cute I picked
this one out now the next things that I
got were some belts now I had kind of
like that corset style belt this chime
was kind of like trending a while ago
but I do like to kind of keep these
around especially when you're trying to
wear like sweater dresses I think that
these work well with kind of like the
sweatshirt dresses
meaning the dresses that are kind of
like the hoodie style dresses put in one
of these belts over that type of dress
definitely brings a dress like you'd be
looking like a snack in that so I do
like to incorporate it with most of my
sweater dresses my sweatshirt dresses
what kind of belts like this so even
though it's kind of like a hoodie dress
and it's kind of like kind of almost
like an athletic look combining with a
belt like that deputy kind of takes it
to another level so I just wanted to
pick this one out just to match it with
it is very stretchy guys so don't be
like discouraged thinking it's not going
to fit
you if you're very curvy it has a very
stretchy stretch band
it does have clasp in the back so
therefore you're able to button it close
and you're definitely able to fit in it
it does have a corset in the front so
you can untie this and tighten it as
much as you want or loosen it as much as
you want so I thought it was really cute
it's definitely kind of like an
accessory piece that can elevate an
outfit so I picked this one out now the
next thing I got is kind of like that
double belted belt double belted belt
yeah that's what it's called so this one
is really cute 9 if you wanted and
silver but they sent me gold I'm a gold
person anyways but I just kinda feel
like this type of gold is little classy
so I do like it though so I'm gonna wear
this with like kind of like playing
bodycon dress things like black dresses
and stuff like that not even body kind
of could even be like a little bit of a
shift dress or something like that but
you guys what I mean just to kind of
give myself a little bit more of a look
even some of the jumpsuits that I have
that I want to kind of wear and want to
style real nice I can actually put these
on my jumpsuits as well too so I kind of
had like a
envision of what I would you what I
would do with these belts so this belt
deputy can go jumpsuits dresses and
stuff I thought was really cute I love
the double belted method that they have
on this one I think that it was really
well done it is stretchy as well too so
if you are curvy do not be afraid this
will work it's SuperDuper stretchy as
you guys can see I can stretch this out
so if you are curvier and you're afraid
that oh my god it's not gonna work
because I'm my back any too small listen
my back is a small either and this is
definitely this definitely work for me
so definitely consider purchasing this I
think it's very fashionable
it definitely has kind of like a 90s
vibe or like a late a late 80s Early 90s
vibe to it so I definitely thought that
this was totally totally cute now the
last accessory I'm gonna show you guys
are these shoes now I when I got picked
these shoes on the website I thought
they were gonna be kind of different and
there were they're a little bit
different so these do fit guys but I
just feel like I needed some extra room
in these so these are kind of like these
nice pointy kind of like flat or tartan
sow tweed style shoes and does have a
fur outline in the inside so it's
definitely really soft now the problem I
see with these shoes is that it's very
very pointy very very narrow and if
you're the type of person that doesn't
pick up their feet when they're walking
you will be tripping all over the place
with these so it's definitely one of
those shoes like if you're someone
that's really petite and duggie with
walking and stuff like that but if
you're an aggressive walking you gotta
get to work
you gotta get stuff done I don't
recommend wearing these to work like I
just got it but these are just a little
bit too the way they constructed them or
just it just the concept wasn't good you
know
then kind of think the concept through
what the concept is not great with these
but I do like the style and I'm
considering doing Poshmark I think is it
Pasha I think I'm considering doing that
so a lot of the items that you guys seen
you guys like oh my god you get so many
things and then like what do you do with
it so I'm considering doing Poshmark so
I can kind of sell some of the items and
don't think I'm about to come out here
sell you these for like $300 or like 20
bucks cause come on now like I'm not
that type of person so expect to see
great prices along with my wig website
expect to see wonderful prices so I
don't want you guys to think I'm about
to come on here and be like bad and
boozy try to charge you guys like a lot
of money for what so
considering doing Poshmark for some of
my clothes I just don't like I don't
need or they just don't fit and that
they just something that I'm not going
to utilize so definitely I will keep you
guys updated about that just because I
feel like that's important I don't want
to keep all this stuff like my room is
almost like this had no storage here
anymore like I'm just like overloaded
and it's getting kind of overwhelming so
definitely look out for that guys but I
do like these I think they're cute and
if someone can definitely wear these and
be comfortable on them and not and that
they're not rushing around it's just
it's just a little too pointy and a
little bit too dangerous for me and like
I said they fit but I feel like I needed
more wiggle room I need a little bit
more I'm space in these so bummer
