is going to be a little bit different so
um today's video I'm gonna talk to you
guys about my recent weight loss so I'm
gonna try to give you guys as much
information as I can if I don't give you
guys all the information in this video
I'll kind of do a second video and an
update so my starting weight was 210
pounds and my weight now is a hundred
and seventy nine point four pounds so
I've lost approximately like 31 pounds
we'll say 31 pounds and it took me about
two and a half months to lose this
weight so I went to Thailand in March
and when I came back from Thailand I
came back from Thailand about March 16th
and around like the 20-something I
decided to start this diet now the only
reason why I decided to start this diet
is because me and one of my friends
decided to kind of do like a weight-loss
journey together now she has done this
diet previous and I was like okay since
you know how to do it I'm gonna fall
along with you and kind of learn so you
definitely couldn't get the app on your
phone were you able to count your macros
which is how this diet is beta based off
the keto diet so um I was like okay I'm
not gonna do that because she knows how
to do it so I'm gonna what I'm gonna do
is just write everything down so the
basis of this diet was you can only eat
20 grams of carbs a day now now I'm from
the islands I'm Haitian like everything
we eat is rice beans rice beans and
stuff like that you know and me and all
that kind of stuff but our diet is based
off of rice and beans and any Caribbean
any Hispanic we all eat the same kind of
stuff like rice and bean is our base so
when you're coming from a Caribbean you
know background and you eat rice and
beans just about every single day it is
extremely hard guys straight up to come
off of something like that like
initially so um I'm gonna be completely
honest with you guys this diet was
definitely hard in the beginning now um
it's not this dice not for everyone
maybe Weight Watchers works very well
I've done Weight Watchers before and
I've recommended Weight Watchers before
in my previous video this diet I'm gonna
be 100% with you it is hard in the
beginning of the diet you will have
struggles like you will honestly feel
sick and we call that the keto flu so
three days within
the diet I was feeling really sick and I
was like at the point like I can't do
this anymore so when you're like someone
that eats a lot of carbs and people
don't ever look at it this guy has
tailored me to look at every single
thing I actually like flashback my old
habits like did I really eat this like I
honestly used to eat a carb in the
morning carbon afternoo carbon at night
my entire life is based on carbs guys
now I'm gonna back up just like maybe
like last year 2017 2017 I stopped
eating meat so I'm kind of going into my
like first full round in the air like
since I stopped eating me now when I
stop eating meat guys I started loading
up the carbs now that is the biggest
mistake to make and I'm gonna say this
to anyone who's transitioning into being
a pescetarian a vegetarian or vegan if
you're gonna be any of those three
things
do not use carbs as a substitute I made
the biggest mistake when I stopped
eating meat by eating carbs I'm eating
like extra pasta extra rice and carbs
rice rice have carbs and beans has carbs
so I'm eating rice and beans all the
time and stuff like that with avocado
which is blazing but that's carb so I
used to substitute with carbs just to
kind of fill myself in and if you don't
know this once you need the car two
hours later that thing has run through
you are ready and you're ready for the
next set of carbs so I'm just eating
eating eating eating eating now when you
eat substance like protein is stuff at
that that stuff actually fills you up so
therefore you can eat like a nice
portion of a protein with like a
broccoli and stuff like that and you can
be full for at least six hours and not
have to worry about eating after that's
why I feel like the keto diet works
cause honestly and truly guys
I can eat a meal and not be hungry for
hours I have to honestly remind myself
hey Dom have a protein shake so it's
like the type of diet we're like once
your body adjust to this diet you no
longer are you're never you're no longer
tied down to food the back of chip isn't
grabbing you anymore the cookies ain't
calling for you anymore because your
mind is just not set on that anymore
like I don't think about food the way I
used to
I do enjoy food now still I just don't
enjoy I mean I'm just not indulging in
the wrong foods that are gonna cause me
to you know have
now one major reason why this doctors
diet as well too is because I have a
family history of diabetes and it's
really strong on my father's side my dad
had and his brother had and they both
passed away from you know and stage
kidney failure and stuff like that from
you know complications of diabetes so
I'm trying to kind of live it I'm trying
to be proactive with my health as well
too so it's also a health based thing as
well too I'm like you know I just don't
want to you know end up being one of
either even my sisters and my older
sister actually lost 30 pounds so we're
all kind of like on a weight-loss
journey trying to get to a point where
we're healthy enough so that we're not
causing ourselves to be you know we're
not predisposed in ourselves to those
diseases for that in the near future or
even around now because things like that
can happen if it's already in your
family and it's there you know you're
bound to be you know you're already
predisposed to it but you don't want to
cause your body to you know say okay I'm
ready to get this disease so I'm trying
to live a healthier lifestyle the older
you get the slower metabolism is and
it's kind of hard to lose weight but
this diet guys honestly works very well
guys even if your metabolism slows I
know people who are older than me have
I've done this diet that have been very
successful people have lost 60 70 80
pounds and this is healthy weight loss
guys it's not the type of weight loss
where you're just got to be sloppy after
you lose away honestly you lose inches
off of your body you feel healthy you
honestly don't even have to work out I
did work out a little bit and I did way
strange so I will tell you guys I'll
show you guys exactly what I did but
this is a lifestyle change I really need
to do this because I noticed that I was
really you know getting too comfortable
and I was starting to gain a lot of
weight and I was looking at my videos
I'm like yo I'm looking fluffy like I
just lost all this way and I'm putting
back this way and I'm just like why is
this happening
and there's nothing wrong with trying to
fix yourself or trying to improve
yourself I did this for health based
reasons and just trying to kind of get
myself back to where I know myself back
on my feet now 180 pounds was my goal I
honestly think that's where I feel
comfortable at and I know you guys
probably look at I'm like what are you
Tom best not even like a healthy weight
I don't care about the number honestly I
care about how I feel and how I look if
I look good and I feel good that's what
I care about I want
to cut off around 180 because I felt
like 30 pound weight loss was a good
weight loss going to the 50 pound weight
loss for that's just unnecessary I think
I'm good right now I think it's fine
right now and what I'm trying to work on
now is trying to maintain other way so
what I've research is like people are
saying that if you're on keto and you're
trying to come off keto maintain it to
kind of do like 50 grams to 100 grams of
carbs a day and then you're able to
maintain the weight so basically my
right now what I'm doing is maintenance
keto so I'm just trying to keep it low
carbs and trying to eat stuff as well
you know try to be careful no snacking
and stuff like that so I'm trying to
keep it basic and still stay in ketosis
a little bit but try to wiggle around
sometimes when I want to go out and
stuff like that have like a drink have
some stuff with my friends and stuff
like that and when I go with my
boyfriend so like I said it's a diet
where you can only to eat 20 grams of
carbs a day so that means you will not
be eating rice anymore you won't be
eating pasta anymore you won't be eating
bread anymore and stuff like that which
is cool so basically what I did is I had
to really learn my labels so with keto
if you don't have like the app or
anything like that you have to have 20
net carbs a day or 20 grams of carbs so
if you're trying to calculate your net
carbs basically what you have to do is
for instance look on the back of a bag
of potato chips so if the potato chips
is 36 grams of carbs you want to in the
fiber is like seven you do 36 minus 7
and then whatever the remainder is that
is the grams that's the net grams so
obviously that's gonna be not you can't
eat that because you already surpassed
the grams but that's how you calculate
your net carbs you do with the carbs
minus the fiber and then that's the net
carbs whatever the remainder number is
that's your net carbs so I did have to
do like a lot of calculating at the
grocery store reading a lot of labels so
you definitely learn a lot in this diet
process and another thing about this
diet that's great you really kind of
like make a lot of recipes learn a lot
of different recipes that kind of based
around this diet I do cook a lot at home
now just because it's easier I can prep
all the meals I want it's like really
healthy really fresh foods and I'll have
them and I'll still be able to lose
weight and be very happy it's really
hard going on in frustrating especially
when you don't eat meat and you have to
have you can't eat meat and you don't
eat carbs so
I'm going on to restaurants I have a
hard time picking out stuff so I really
had to find ways to kind of skate
through things you know look at menus
prior to going out so it's almost kind
of like an extra homework assignment
every single day that you're doing no
it's not even actually a homework
assignment it's a project every day that
you're doing so every day you're kind of
having to calculate what you have to do
the first week it's gonna be kind of
hectic but once you kind of get into the
motion of things you're gonna be fine
trust me guys I made it like I made it
so if I'm if I can make it guys you guys
can make it
I honestly and truly did not think that
this was gonna work I'm being completely
honest with you guys I did not think
that this diet was gonna work yes I did
weigh myself and saw the numbers coming
down but numbers don't mean anything to
me once I started seeing my body change
I was like yo this is working guys so
what I'm gonna say to you guys is this
diet takes inches so you're gonna start
seeing like parts of your body slimming
down like my arms have gotten smaller my
neck has gotten smaller you're starting
to see my collarbone a lot
so another component that I added to
this diet guys with the intermediate
fasting so basically what I do is I fast
for 16 hours and I only eat eight hours
a day within eight hours range of a day
so I do that mostly what I'm going to
work just because I either work 12 hour
shifts or eight hour shifts so I have
enough time within my work schedule to
eat at a certain time and then go home
and not eat for 16 hours so it worked
out very well for me and I noticed that
when I did do the intermediate fasting I
was able to lose more weight and the
weight was coming off kind of
consistently every week so every week I
was 2 pounds 5 pounds 3 pounds you know
so it's always consistent I was always
losing some type of weight so it was
very successful that way so what I'm
gonna show you guys now is the waist
trainer that I've been using to kind of
maintain my curves I know you guys have
noticed that I still have my curves even
throughout this weight loss that was one
major thing that I was trying to keep
because I know that sometimes when you
lose weight you kind of lose your but
you kind of lose all that stuff for me I
have not really lost my but it does it
does look like it got a little bit
smaller but my frame is smaller now like
my stomach's a little bit flatter now so
and then my
start like a little bit more leaner and
then like even that kind of nice fat
pocket that I used to have in my crotch
area right where the bikini line is that
has kind of dimmed down a lot too so
it's kind of there's a lot of inches
that are coming off with the angles of
my body right now and I have no
complaints about that because the assets
that I wanted to remain there have
stayed the only thing about me now is
kind of like I got my boobs done in
January and it was kind of based off of
my weight around that time so that has
650 CC implants on both sides I started
with a 350 when I initially was skinnier
and then as I got bigger the 350s just
did not match my body anymore so one
thing that is quite obvious now that my
boobs look extremely bigger now so my
boobs are doubled to the size that they
were before but because my frames a
little bit small guys they appear so
much bigger than they did when I first
got the implants done like like a few
months ago so that's the only thing but
I've adjusted to it it's just gonna I'm
just gonna look like I have large
breasts now and like they just look way
bigger so let me show you guys what I've
been using to kind of keep my curves and
please alright now this is a J sculpt
and it's created by another youtuber
called Jaz Jackson now I did get the
recommendation from soul friend I'm and
I watch one of her videos and I'll leave
it down below for you guys so you guys
gonna watch our video on this so this
thing that has definitely helped me out
tremendously guys I got mines in a shirt
size extra large and it fits good now
and it's a little bit loose so I am
ordering a new one in a size large but I
do recommend this product guys it
definitely has sculpt in my body so
nicely so basically guys this is like
the end of the video I'll try to leave
all the information down below for you

from this weight loss guys this is
probably the most control I've ever had
