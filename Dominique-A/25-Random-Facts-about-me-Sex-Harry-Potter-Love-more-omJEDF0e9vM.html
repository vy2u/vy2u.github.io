going to be a fun video I'm trying to
introduce these fun videos to my channel
just because it's fun so today's video
is going to be the 25 random facts about
me so I just think is just jump into it
and we'll just kind of get through this
nicely so the first one is I'm obsessive
Harry Potter now if you are like one of
the few friends that I have and any
associate that and me in my life now I
don't know if there's like a Harry
Potter radar or whatever but anyone that
I'm friends with or and like just
associates with or just meeting everyone
that I know it has the same Harry Potter
radar that I do I love Harry Potter and
I've been obsessed with this since
elementary school it's just something
that I grew up with so I've always just
been on it like that I absolutely love
that thing and leave your time example
if you like it as well
number two I had a pet turtle I had a
pet turtle two years old my pet turtle
died I guess he's got sick and died it
was really sad I was so heartbroken
because before my dad my dad gave me
that turtle so I was just like really
sad I was look so sad guys it was just
really sad number three I can sing I
don't know I've seen in the comments
before that you guys said that I have a
sick when I talk to sounds that I'm
singing so I do sing like I see well I
used to sing like it's like I was
looking the highest choir like group and
then friggin high school I was just like
all of it plays like you know have my
little solo moments but like like I
don't do it anymore just because I don't
think I found as good as I used to
okay number four I lost my virginity
when I was 18 every time I tell people
that they kind of expect that I would
said like twelve or fourteen nothing to
go through lots of virginity early but
people expected that I would have lost
my virginity like way earlier than
eighteen like what's he trying to say
dork like whatever but I lost him when I
was 18 so I'm number five I only had two
serious relationships I'm a spiritual
Asian ship now and I had a past
relationship so only two people only two
but that doesn't mean I only dated two
guys you know are dated a whole bunch
but
these are the only two that I had that
were serious number six I have five
tattoos and I am getting a new tattoo
and I probably love the new tattoo I get
is because it'd be something cool to see
and it's actually gonna be pretty nice
so you guys are probably really excited
for me and want to laugh at me because
I'd be oh my god let me the worst start
to ever that was my foot tattoo oh my
god it hurts so bad but that's another
story
number seven my favorite show is Grey's
Anatomy and I'm going to say that for
the moment just because it's just
something I keep like me playing on
Netflix and sometimes it comes up on
channel on lifetime most of the time so
into something I'm always looking at
like I just like it a lot and I know
it's so cliche because I'm in the
medical field but it's just I just like
that fuck with that so hard like it's
just really cool even though it's like
that fake trauma stuff cuz none of that
stuff ever happens in real life they
just over you know Shonda Rhimes would
be going a little overboard okay number
eight I enjoy walks at the park as
cliche as that sounds I love walks at
the park like if it's a really nice day
I'll do like instead of like working out
I'll do like a three I like walk around
the park like three times
it just it's really soothing and I on
music and it's just a nice brisk walk
and then the beat that like the the like
the beach is like right Nana so you
could see like I should I just love it I
just I like it so I do it all the time
number nine I've been speed-dating
before I think I was like about a year
ago like I don't even my friends wanted
to but I wasn't interested in going
because at that point I was in a
relationship where the relationship is
kind of falling into shambles buzz hold
up when was the shouting fuck remember
but I went with my friend Zoe's like a
speed dating party whatever it was cool
I wasn't talking about her do anything
but it was just a good experience yeah
number 10 I met my boyfriend at the club
so the current guy that I'm dating now I
met him at the club and I always used to
say oh I would never date somebody that
I met at the club but hey shit happens
it was unexpected and it works so
number eleven my favorite thing to eat
is avocados with everything I don't know
if it's a Haitian thing like eating like
my mullet avocados or eating right to
avocado and since I'm just obsessed with
it I just love avocado what everything
is just that's just it like I eat it
with eggs I eat it with spaghetti like
it's just like it's old you good like I
eat that shit all the time
I don't know number 12 I have a left I
stigmatism I don't like I was I'm I
don't know if you guys noticed but like
I have poor vision like I used to words
a great context I think some people
thought that the great content you just
for beauty but it was actually a plus on
top of a plus because the great eyes are
prescription and they were they were the
color blends the true looks color blends
or whatever it was and those were
prescription contact lenses but I just
recently stopped wearing them I don't
know I just look like my natural eyes
and I said well like the grey contact
that brand was making my eyes really
hurt so I just ended that when I just
went to some regular contact lenses that
are clear and just less trouble I just
I'm Way more happier with my natural
eyes and it just I don't know but I
cannot see so I'm like really like my
eyesight is poor or hey my name is that
they not only shake and they blow my
motherfucking phone up so you know what
we're going to disregard that those
thing in the background because people
be annoying so number 13 I've only truly
loved one guy and I'm going to like okay
the guy died with right now I know I
love him you know saying like the dog
was so before I was so young and naive
and so many things that I learned so
much in my last relationship and like
things that I did back like with that
guy like things like I was I was naive I
was young it was the first time that I
was in love with somebody I thought I
was in love with somebody but then I lot
myself to be mistreated in our
relationship and now I'm a new
relationship that I kind of like was
fearful about and kind of like really
made sure things were going to be right
I just know that I love this gun I
honestly truly believe that he's the
only guy I truly love so and I'm
reporting I haven't added to and I don't
eat I'm always angry like if I don't
like I'm not a breakfast person but I
need to at least eat something around
like
eleven o'clock or like ten or twelve
like I don't wake up really to eat but
if I don't need my first meal in before
eleven or twelve I have an attitude and
my boyfriend knows that like he comes
back home and I'm just kind of like like
I'm like like I'm just really like just
don't talk to me go get me something to
eat like I really have attitude and I
don't eat like what is number fifteen my
father passed away when I was 13 not a
lot of people know that because I don't
talk about shit like that but my father
passed away when I was 13 yet and stage
kidney failure from complications of
diabetes and high blood pressure it's
like my african-american killer guys but
yeah he passed through enough 1316 I
wish I was bigger sometimes I know I'm
going to get so much heat from this but
like honestly sometimes I really wish
that I was bigger I just like there's a
freedom I don't know what it is I just
love it like I love doing like oh like
plus-sized or something over because I'm
overweight now I just I just like it
like I don't know like I lose weight
just to be healthy because you know I
look at myself and I love the exam
you're letting yourself go right now I
could tell them getting a little bit
chunkier because my face is trying to
get like puffy so I don't know if that's
from like menstral because like I don't
know I just well let them get a little
dense right now so I just like I wish I
was bigger sometimes it's just kind of
put that there as you guys leave a
comment down the long singing I don't
somebody got to agree with me number 17
I plan on dating the same sex if that
relationship doesn't work out you guys
know like I'm like instable so I just
like I've really never taken the time to
be like really with like a girl girl
like that but like I like I know that
relationships going to work just because
the weight is I don't know I love them
but like I'm saying like you know I
don't mind next time if this doesn't
work out to try to dip into like being
in a serious relationship with a female
it is what it is if this doesn't plan or
like pan out the way I would like to
then that's whatever happens next is
maybe the course I do plan on dating the
same sex if it just happened so just
went out there number 18 is I don't have
that many friends
I just keep up small circles people that
I've been with I have some riders since
high school that I just been my riders
and I don't really introduce
any new people into my groups it's
because it's just it just get
complicated girls are a lot of drama and
nobody has time for that shit because I
just got a lot of other things on my
fucking mind like Pharrell
so I'm enough time for that but I tried
I don't mind making friends I like I
love people I don't love to talk
obviously but I just don't like to bring
too many new people into the circle
because it just gets crazy this is too
much too messy I want a baby I know
everyone said you gotta get marry
Express and all that stuff but like I
mean I feel like I'm on the verge of
those things happening soon so I just
fled I'm not having like this baby fever
like I just really want a baby like and
I think of us that way you're like well
you know you can do by yourself that's
like really on your mind I go I'm not a
financial to do it by myself and stuff
like that but it's just kind of like
that's in my mind and I'm like being
like oh my god I want to be me and I
should just do it doesn't matter I'd be
okay I don't mean I'm gonna help me but
I just I just want a baby on like baby
fever like I'm always watching Dom oh
and Chrissy on here and they're like a
lesbian couple and they're having a baby
boy together and I'm just every time I
watch their blogs was just so happy for
them but just what a baby is so bad that
is a sad no whatever number 20 I'm
