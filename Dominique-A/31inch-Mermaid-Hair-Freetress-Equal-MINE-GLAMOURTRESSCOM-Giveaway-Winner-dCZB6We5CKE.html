what video it's a part Indian what tell
me Mike sit on that mean we are working
hard on when you want to focus how's it
going so welcome back to another with
Wednesday now in today's with Wednesday
I'll be showing you guys a synthetic
lace wig now I know you guys know to
send all my wig Wednesdays I'm kind of
mixing it up I'm doing some human hair
quality waves and some synthetically and
this is one of the free trust equal lace
front wigs and this is eternity
collection now you guys know I've been
killing free trust equal that is one of
my favorite favorite brands I will be
venturing off into some other stuff but
for now I'm going to stick with what I
know and what I like and what you guys
like - now this one is their kind of new
collection and this collection has like
a lot of long long units now this unit
that I'm going to show you guys it's
called mine it's a style mine and this
is a color ot1 be 30 and it is 31 inches
long so basically this is like a dreamy
long flowing type of hair let me show
you guys what the card actually looks
like so the card looks like that and
this is the unit and I think the color
of the card is similar to the color that
I chose I wanted something that's more
kind of like festival inspired or
festival like trying to do some type of
Coachella inspired or kind of like
festival inspired looks for you guys so
that you guys get some ideas for the
festival season that is approaching us
slowly like we want to hear that looks
like guys what I notice what this unit
is that it doesn't have a party so
there's no out part in Ana - it with
this one is just regular old little
bitty lace in the front you can make
like a small little part in it but I
don't think I'm going to do that I'm
going to show you guys what I'm going to
do to kind of get it to look a little
bit realistic and cute so this is a unit
guys it is super duper duper long but it
is very pretty
it's kind of like a spiral II wavy
pattern and obviously to see all the
highlights and
this is what the front looks like you
only get about two inches of parking
space in the front they legitimately
like two inches but you can work it out
a little bit and you get also you get
two combs on the side right here and
also comb in the back with an adjustable
shot so I'm going to cut the lights off
try to do like some time apart with it I
don't know how much of a part I can get
with this unit honestly and truly so
we're going to try to style it up until
I kind of like a fun festival look for
you guys and I really do like the color
and it is super super super long so if
you're interested in seeing what this
unit looks like I want you to stay tuned
don't know Padma yeah yeah but she bit
you what you baby oh yeah it's a fun
hunting yes what tell me Mike did not
catch me I will keep the economy strong
when you watch the people you want in a
clip Donna very okay get on up there I'm
sure now I give you anything and I'm a
class one here why don't you
I wonder why no no tell you what you
want to enjoy we are no God miss
conscious mother he loved no finance law
this one will be private your amigo tell
me what you want to know I will give you
all that more come on I feel awful why
uncle is gonna be present to all your
friends ourselves you think Ashley your
eyes researching on the rapaera combine
follow me follow me follow me follow me
follow me follow me follow me
omatsu sonication so we know I mean come
on whenever anyone so like obviously you
can tell that I was feeling myself extra
heavy throughout this whole entire video
like this wig is so so beautiful guys it
doesn't even have a part guys like and
that's crazy it barely has a part I
basically just kind of take the part out
and dig no I know you guys know to set
it as the moose on I perfectly have the
Moose on so that I can get the hair to
lay this way and not kind of get all
frizzy and messy the texture is kind of
like a loose spiral curl going down so
it's kind of that type of here that will
get really crazy real soon so I kind of
want to make sure that the bang actually
stayed this way
wow this hair is absolutely gorgeous and
I have not really seen that many people
reviews on YouTube yet but oh my god
why hasn't anybody purchase this wig
like if you like long hair this is 31
inches on let me show you guys how long
it is this is 31 inches long and it is
super cute guys like and you
know it's funny I never do highlighted
colors or synthetic wigs there I try to
stay away from that alot just because it
looks funny but this right here this 31
inches of fabulous color right here is
pop
I want to tell you guys to go out and
get this hair like you guys saw how it
kind of faked it I'd like some baby
hairs by cutting and trying to make it
look as realistic as possible I honestly
feel like I kind of achieved that like
nails it all the head hit the nail on
the head this is definitely some
festival festival fun wig like you could
rock this like oh my god like this is so
I think you guys like it if you're not
really a color person like I'm not
really too too much of a color person
but just adding this little bit of dirty
highlight and it just really made it
come to life even more I am so so
satisfied and pleased with this unit
guys I have new complaints whatsoever
now before I run off of this video guys
I want to make sure that it announce the
winner of the giveaway and that will
actually insert the name and I think was
a shantae SH and I really like Shantae
I'm not sure but I'm not going to want
to chop and screw her a username or her
name so I'll put their name down here
and she's the winner of the swimsuit I
want to say thank you guys all who
actually put in underneath the comments
put a number down I need four comments
for the video for the baton system
giving away she actually was the only
one or the first one that I saw that did
that pick the number 27 which is my
birthday so I was really happy about
that so she is a winner I won't do more
giveaways in the future guys so don't
worry about that for this unit you loved
it and I feel like that's as much as I
