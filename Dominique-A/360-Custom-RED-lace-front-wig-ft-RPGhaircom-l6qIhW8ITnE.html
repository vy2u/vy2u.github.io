all right so this is what the hair looks
like from our PG here obviously I
customized the unit so it's not exactly
the way look when I first got it
so I basically bleached this hair color
this hair cut this here and then just
showed you guys what it looks like which
is now so I do really like this hair
guys obviously like I said it's not
black like it was before so I basically
went from doing a black unit to a
colored unit I want to show you guys the
potential some of these companies
because sometimes when you get virgin
hair and you try to customize it
yourself you run into problems with
shedding the hair losing its texture etc
etc so with RPG here I had no issues
with this hair at all I bleached it for
30 minutes using 40 volume developer and
just a quick white powder and it
bleached like this I then went in with
the hair dye from adora I used two
bottles of paprika and one bottle of
copper red thrown about another 30
minutes in the hair process like this so
the hair has not lost any of his body
it's still really really flowy the only
thing I did is I went in with my curling
iron added just some light waves to it
just to give it more of a grudge II kind
of like fun grudge look and obviously
have to change my whole outfit because I
feel like with this hair it'll be like
real it was really nice kind of like
winter grudge looks like you can do like
a lot of grungy looks with this so
that's one reason why I like this so
much because in the beginning I was
skeptical thinking like oh it's too you
know too out there too much but let me
tell you something there's people out
here that will rock the hell out of this
so don't ever get that twisted it
definitely looks really good with the
dark lips oh I I don't know I just
really like it especially the cut I
didn't do anything special with the cut
you guys know I'm not professional so
the only thing I did was I just cut the
ends off I just like did a blunt cut
through and it was 16 inches to begin
with but it wasn't it didn't have enough
power in them enough off for me so I
just ditched that idea and I was like
you know I'm just gonna cut the ends off
and make it more messy and fun so I
definitely like it like this it's fun
it looks more effortless and not so
uniform which is one thing that I really
like about this hair guys so that's
about it for this hair guys I will leave
all the links down below and all the
products that I used to achieve this
look I'm very very pleased with this and
if
looking for hair that you can just
process and transform definitely check
out our PG here this unit I'm not sure
what the price is but I'll link
everything down below this is a 360
units you're gonna get your four inches
of parting space from the front and two
in the back so with this one you can do
like a lot of fun styles in the front
pot you guys know me I don't do stuff
like that so well I do stuff like that
but it's very rare so you guys know how
I do but other than that guys it's
definitely like this this will
definitely be like one of those kind of
like fun grudge looks for the fall so
I'm definitely excited about that so
don't forget guys to thumbs up this

friends and family and I will catch you
