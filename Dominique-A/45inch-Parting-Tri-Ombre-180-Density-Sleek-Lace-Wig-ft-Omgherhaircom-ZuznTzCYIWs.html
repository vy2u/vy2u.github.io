unit so this unit guys is sent to me
from oMG her hair calm so this is the
first-ever tri-colored unit
well not their first ever my first ever
tricolor unit so I've never done a
review on a unit that was tricolor
before I was a little bit skeptical just
because dying here and getting it
precise like this is super duper hard so
this company actually did pretty well
guys so in the top of the wig it starts
off like at a number one be a natural
color and it actually goes into like the
number six which is like a chocolate
brown and then it goes into this kind of
like 27 blonde now I'm not too much of a
big fan of the 27 color at the bottom
guys I'm kind of getting used to it I
just almost feel like it's a little bit
too light and I wish they would've did
like a number 30 which is kind of like
an Auburn kind of like a like a honey
blonde honey blonde so I almost wish it
went into like a honey blonde color but
the good thing about this unit though
guys is because the bottom is already
kind of bleached and processed like a
nice light blonde you can definitely go
in with your own box eye or whatever dye
you have and just add the color on top
of it it's definitely to pick up the
color with no issues so you can actually
customize this yourself as far as
everything else with this unit guys I
definitely want to highly say to you
guys that the parting space is a 1 now
you do get about 5 inches of parting
space on this unit guys so it starts
here and stops here which is a great
amount of parting space now the parting
space obviously on the sides it kind of
ends short but in this region right here
which is this big crown area pair it
definitely gives you the five inches of
parting space that you'll need to do
kind of like side styles little curved
parts and stuff like that which is
definitely great now this unit is did
not come to me straight guys it actually
came in like comments like a body wave
style I look like the kind of process of
curls it for me I didn't like that just
because it really didn't show you guys
the Tricolore so what I ended up doing
was just straightening the hair out so
you guys can see what it looked like
true state like tri color wise so you
guys can kind of get like an overview of
this so this is it overview guys and
what
not to mention dyes it's not all it's a
little bit like balayage in a way the
way these come in and the back the
deputy could have went in in the car you
know you know what they did at the job
so in the back right here you can see
how it's kind of transitioning into
colors and it's just not coming through
straight if it came through just kind of
like strange sections I just kind of
feel like that wouldn't look natural so
I definitely think they did a great job
kind of transitioning the hombres into
each layer which is definitely great so
this is not a 360 week guys it's only a
lace-front so you're getting the
interlace in the beginning which is good
now this guy's does fit very well this
is a medium capsize and all I did with
this one guys is just a justice strap
and then call it a day so as far as it's
fitting my head is true to size and it
does it just fits very nice overall I do
like this it's something that I would
say if you want some kind of ombre hair
stop for the summertime definitely
consider getting something like this if
you're someone that's unsure about what
colors to go for I definitely think that
this may be you know a color for someone
who was kind of experienced with ombre
style colors and if you're someone that
does not like the 27 or whatever at the
bottom you can definitely change it just
because it's just like easy like that
for me I'm gonna leave mines the way it
is just because I don't have a unit like
this and I want something that's
different something that's fun and fresh
and tricolor is definitely coming very
popular that I've noticed lately so I
definitely want to be part of that trend
so guys I'll leave all the information
down below if you're interested in
purchasing this unit from omg are here
