another with Wednesday video and I got
my hat on today trying to be real
stylish or whatever but anyway so the
windows show you guys today is from the
silk is from the stylist collection so
this is a silk top lacewing and it's a
four by four so you do get like a good
amount of parting space at the nice
tippity-top of the wig now this is in
the kinda style Swiss goddess and it's
the color f1b 30 so instead of me going
for black this time I kind of went in
for color just because it's summer I'm
trying to do color and I'm trying to do
something different now specifically for
this unit guys this is a synthetic unit
so this is not a human hair unit like
I've been reviewing some kind of
throwing these into the mix right now
because you guys love when I do those
really affordable units so if I'm not
mistaken this one is less than 450
dollars and you get four inches up you
get a four by four which is that 4
inches for into the boarding space which
is amazing so this is definitely
something I would check out insanity
calm now link everything down below for
you guys but let me show you guys
exactly what the unit looks like so in
the beginning my bag after unit is a
little nervous cuz I like the color I
thought that the highlight was a little
bit chunky and I didn't want it to be
chunky like that because it doesn't look
real but this one there's ways to party
to that for therefore you don't get that
chunky look from the highlight now it is
about an 18 inch long unit and it does
kind of have like that it looks like
they bumped into the unit so it's like
nice and bumped up ends it is a very
very nice african-american textured here
which I just that is one thing I love
about synthetic units that are like this
and some synthetic unit I like the
african-american texture I definitely go
for those first now like for instance
right here you get like a chunky
highlight right here but it's not that
type of chunky highlight words kind of
plastic and fake looking this actually
looks pretty natural it looks like a
blowout so I'm excited about that let me
show you guys at the parting space of
size so
this is the parking space right here it
does come with two cones right here on
the side and cause what one in the back
and adjustable strap as usual so I'm
definitely utilize this part see what I
can do I'm probably just going to do
like a really simple cute hairstyle and
keep it real cute and simp just because
I'm not got time to do all that extra
crazy that's just not me and you
guys already know that edgy guys would
follow me for this long so I'm going to
cut the lace over hit this one I'm
definitely going to put some baby hairs
around the perimeter and try to make it
look cute I'm really excited to try this
one out with the color I just think it's
going to look fabulous
so yeah so if you're interested in
ah
Oh
ah
guys I want to give a huge shout out to
Sam's video conference sending me this
unit and I also want to give a huge
shout out to the stylist company this
unit is a 1 now I'm not joking I'm not
making up guys you guys can just see
where do you see synthetic wig on this
is I was like oh my god I'm like I don't
even know what to say because this is
definitely probably one of the best
synthetic units I've had thus far this
 goes hard now the last year is that
I reviewed all synthetic hair color in
it and I thought that was like the
infinity and beyond of colored units
that I would try now I took a risk with
this one B 30 but bitch it is coming
through full throttle I you cannot tell
me that this hair style this wig itself
is not on point and to make things even
better with this unit it comes with four
by four parting space like why like and
you know it's funny I've been reviewing
so many human hair was a kind of I kind
of forgot about my synthetic wigs but
when I put this on my head I was like
wow Dom you have really been missing out
on the game I absolutely and in love
with this wig know if there was a human
hair duplicate of this I would wear
this unit every single day that's how
frickin amazingly flawless this wig is
now the wig is a little bit dense
because it is that has an
african-american texture so if you're
trying to detangle this definitely is a
wide toothed comb or a nice paddle brush
my powder brush works perfectly fine I'm
able to detangle this baby with no
issues as you guys saw I did go in and
cut some baby hair so cut a little bit
of neon hair on the side here to make it
look more human hair like but it doesn't
you mean your likes I don't really have
to go that far but just for styling
purposes I went in and did that now guys
please let me know where you see an
imperfection in this unit this unit is
 fabulous like I've really been
missing my synthetic wig gang my
synthetic wig reviews so I definitely am
coming back with some of those too he
here's pop it in all the synthetic wigs
are definitely works that is very
inexpensive very affordable and
look at less than $30 I mean listen less
than 50 dollars and you are looking like
a goddess you know like this is a joke
like this has to be a joke like this is
this I'm completely satisfied I will
leave everything down below for you guys
in regards to this unit I will use a
color tour like everything like this is
absolutely amazing I am so so happy and
now I'm so so rejuvenating like I can
order more synthetic wigs and do more
synthetic wig reviews just because the
game has really stepped up now I don't
know what to say like and one more thing
say I know you guys always put this as a
joke in the comments leg I just kind of
like whip the powder on my head on the
parting space
what powder I don't use wet concealer
just because what concealer looks real
messy so I use face powder or like a
contour powder and I just like slap it
on the part I slept on the corners here
and the inside part here if I'm
depending on if I want to flip it over
like that to do kind of like a Q overlap
overlap here so also that's why you guys
will see me just dropping pot on it I
feel like when you just put the pot on
it looks more natural instead of looking
fix like the concealer so that's why I
do that so guys that's this key and for
this hair do not forget to thumbs up
this video leave your comments down
below hit that subscribe button and also
share this video with your friends and
family and I will catch you guys in the
later videos bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
