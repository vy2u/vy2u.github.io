Kiki give me some water
emerging leader some many mothers and
welcome back for another with Wednesday
I apologize in advance guys I am under
the weather right now I'm not sure about
a flu or strep though or if it's just
like a common cold but I'm not feeling
too well
and my voice has obviously changed to
drop the drogyn is Dominique so yeah but
I hope you guys still enjoy this video
no matter what so continuing almost with
Wednesday's today I'm doing a pre-trip
equal unit and this unit is tabia and I
got in the color 1b now this was sent to
me by Glamour Transcom and you guys know
I've recently been working with Glamour
Transcom so yes in elevate stuff anymore
but since with Jim Cramer Transcom guys
and it's the equal of free trust equal
wig and it's a silk base wing front wig
now the thing about this unit it has a
four by four closure parting space on it
I guess but for me I just keep it simple
and just leave it the way it's parted
this is kind of a little slave textured
unit so it's kind of like a really kind
of like wet and wavy ish kind of look
and like I said it's cavea and it's in
the color 1b it does come in a wide
variety of colors in the back and this
is actually what the model looks like so
you guys can see it it's kind of like a
really nice wavy unit someone is blowing
my phone up okay so it's kind of like a
waving unit like - so you guys look
close and these are just a list of the
colors that they have and it is kind of
iron safe but I just don't even waste my
time using soon curling I just leave the
way it is so yes if you guys are
interested in seeing what this unit
looks like on me I want you to stay
tuned and keep on watching
oh I'm gay kiss me Dickie nah nah
Kiki give me some water
does in Italian
yeah
monkey feeder somany mother on TV money
none of you know my order Jimmy mobile
Oh bleep you never be a darling he was
blind and again my father he wants the
one that won it high-grade from my
business baby
I'm going insane red crown baby to come
to my age
Charlie setting busted my brain like a
my girl yogurt my game your loss my pain
look down the way you go down they look
now not me they run the whole town kind
of the city because of whether gold
crown so give it up for bad man but I
don't Batman I didn't press these dogs
and she will dis catch man rapper he
gonna get arrested
when I get off see you're into this
black man so make you join my crew got
so I definitely definitely definitely
definitely love the chair guys like wow
this is so devious and it's like so
pretty guys like I even went in and cut
like a little baby using the front man
like a little bit of a swiftly in the
front so cliche with the baby here thing
guys but I really like it it is like
really big here so you guys long it's
like really really really long and I
just think it looks so cute
the thing I like about it looks like you
got like your hair you got curly hair
you watch then you let it air dry and
then we hit some you have a detangles a
little bit so it just kind of lying that
style and it look really pretty like
this and even with the Uptown thing and
like I showed you that that didn't see
I'll say is it clip on this actual way
because I kind of like a little band
part that actually helps this the wigs
stay flat on your head
so actually helps awake it here on the
hairline Mutulu or where you want it to
stop so therefore it won't slide back
and kind of move around it kind of like
gets the hair to stick on your scalp or
on your forehead where you want it to
stay so I thought that was really great
I think it looks like this looks really
pretty like it looks within that look it
looks like it actually right here later
on I really like this guys
I'm definitely definitely very pleased
with this unit it's really long and
pretty and you in the back you still get
like a little bit of wavy part to the
back but I don't care about I just care
about the kind of like the kind of like
effortless puffiness and kind of slight
waviness
that you get at the tippity-top right
here I just think it looks really nice
and natural it is large here if you
wants you can put it up in a ponytail or
maybe do like a kind of like a little
bot or even two space buns or whatever
you want but for me I probably just wear
like this this is this dodging dispell
just looks cute and fun and you can see
how I like pista Klee styled it up guys
