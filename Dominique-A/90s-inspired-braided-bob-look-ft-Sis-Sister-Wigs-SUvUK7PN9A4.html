another wig review
so today's wig review is brought to you
guys from sis sister wigs which is
basically Zuri Hollywood and this is
their afro braided collection so this
one if you guys watch one of my previous
videos I will link it down below I did a
review on this box braided wig and it
was kind of like the 30 inch box braid
wig so I'll link that down below for you
so they contacted me you want to partner
with me with some reviews so I decided
to partner up with them so the way that
I'm reviewing to you would be for you
guys today is another braided wig this
braided wig is the lace braid bob box
wig so this one is 16 inches long and
it's just going to be one of those kind
of 90s inspired um kind of looks or
whatever so it's going to be a clean
blunt bob look I do get this an acai 1b
and this is full braids from top to
bottom and it also has realistic baby
hairs around the perimeter with these
units you can opt to actually glue them
down or you can just opt to just adjust
the straps and put the cones in it's
like I said I will link my other video
down below for you guys on this unit
itself but this is the unit I'm just
taking a shade off the pack right now
this is an info card that you get with
the unit itself it tells you all the
specs and stuff that you need to know
for the unit so I'm pulling this off in
front of you guys on camera because I
just got it in the mail today and I'm
really excited so it is wow it's
actually a real seat this is a bob girl
so if you're gum if you're really
looking for that 90's look that 90's
inspired bob look this is a unit for you
I actually thought this is a bit cool to
review I actually would like to try some
different styles out because you know me
I like to do extra things a lot so yeah
I wanted to try this out to see what
this would look like so yeah so this is
what it looks like I said off the pack
it is like they said a bobbed wig it is
16 inches all over all around it does
come with two combs at the top right
here yes can see the two combs right
here it also comes with a comb in the
back right hand adjustable straps which
is my fave the lace on this one is a
very soft lace guys is not that hard
hard lace and it does have the baby
hairs as you guys
see and the front outfits can see the
little baby ears right on here so if you
want to use your um your lace glue or
kind of like the got to be good thing
you know these baby hears are actually
pretty popping too by the way
wowzers so the hair is very soft and let
me open the back up so I could show you
guys what they talk about when they say
braided from root to tip it's actually
really braided from root to bottom well
top to bottom so you won't really get
any of that crazy kind of like flyaway
kind of hair patterns in the back so
this is really really cool so I'm going
to try this one on for you guys and I
will be featuring some more on wig
reviews from this company so you guys
have to stay tuned keep on watching for
more videos from this company but I'm
going to cut the lace off of this one
put this one on do my little pressed
powder thing and then I'll come back to
you guys and show you guys with the wig
looks like so stay tuned and keep over
work
so this is what the wig looks like guys
and as you can see artists add some of
them little um bedazzles and hidden
jewels from the beauty supply store into
the unit I didn't really put a lot in
here and sound like for in here
somewhere the brains are very small so
if you're adding like these little
jewels to it you want to double up on
the double up on the brains before you
add them in but these are really this
hair is really cool guys we're just
going to add one more in just for
styling these are the braids are very
cool guys I actually think that this is
this is not even something that I would
regularly do like I wouldn't go and get
my hair done like this but I mean the
whole 90s trend is back in style so I
think it's this is if you're looking for
a style like this this is girl this is
really cute like I'm surprised I didn't
have that many high expectations for a
style like this but this is really cute
and it does remind me when I was a kid
when I used to get box braids with the
ensberg like you know when you as a kid
growing up in the 90s um yeah but this
looks really cute guys um I think like
this is a this is a hit this is not a
Miss wig if you like shorter style
braids this is a good brain
Brady style for you I really like this
guy's like I don't see anything wrong
with this what I'm going to say is that
because of the packaging I guess like it
didn't really get the full form of a
kind of like that curve underneath right
here but for this what I would do for
this part right here since it's not
really kind of giving the dip I'll just
put dip the hair in hot water and I'll
loosen up you can't really strain
because it is not human hair but if you
don't like the way it comes in package
the package kind of messed the wave of
the dip so I'm going to do is just put
it in hot water and have it relax itself
so that it kind of looks nice this would
even look nice if you actually braided
it and wet it and crimped it up oh my
god girl that will be so cute so let me
show you guys the back the back and like
I said it's all like 16 inches in length
so that's what you're gonna get I really
like this guys I think this is fun this
is like something new you can style this
up any type of way I think what I'm
going to do like I said is hot water
that ends a little bit just to kind of
loosen them up so that it looks a little
bit more relaxed but I do like the style
like guys I think this is cute if you're
into brain if you're like a really brave
person I would go for a look like this
it does have the baby hairs and I'm just
kind of letting the baby hairs go wild
because I really don't I don't care too
much about the baby hairs I just care
about the braids himself looking nice
like this looks really really realistic
guys the parting space my powder is
coming off a little bit like lighter in
the camera but I actually went to the
bathroom to look at it after and it's
actually matches pretty well so I just
add powder on the part the parting space
is a very large parting space comes all
the way back here so that's a plus plus
too so make sure you thumbs up this
video guys leave all your comments down
below make sure you subscribe if you
haven't already and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
