review for a company off of Aliexpress
called Yuna's hair company and this will
be my first hair review for 2015 so I'm
very excited I would send 3 bundles of
hair and a closure from a company called
unis hair and they sent me 3 bundles of
hair and a closure and they also send me
a cute little gift with the package as
well so the hair that I got is their 6a
grade here and it's the virgin Peruvian
body wave hair I got the 22 inch bundle
and - 24 inch bundles and an 18 inch
closure
I love with this hair guys it's so
pretty and I legit just got two seconds
to go from DHL so I was so excited to
come here and do this review because I
do plan on coloring this hair to night I
won't tell you guys how I'm gonna color
it and what its gonna look like but just
be stay tuned for my next hair update
field so you guys can see exactly what
the hair looks like so I'll show you
guys what the hair looks like so this is
the 22 inch bundle hair it's very very
nice hair guys as you can see I am in my
bathroom not doing this video because
the light outside is looking great and
my bathroom gives might gives me like a
great video quality so this is what the
hair looks like it is the ends aren't
perfect or not then I run my hands
through the hair and the hair is
absolutely gorgeous guys I believe this
is true to line 22 inches should have
reached right about the top of my belly
button which is true to link the two 24
inch bundles are the same length clearly
and there are longer than the 24 inch
pumpkins you guys can tell right here
and like I said I'll both of the two 24
inch bundles are very nice they're to
Tulane they are full I run my hands
store and I get absolutely no shedding
and that ends on the on these bundles as
well are very full they are not thin
bundle then ends and speaking out then
the bundles aren't thin as walky they're
they're perfectly full bundles this is
almost here you'll get into the 22
and Honda and I think that's like
realistically enough hair for the length
the longer hair you get the less hander
you get in the bundle which is everyone
knows that so that's the 22 inch and
these are two the 22 4 inch bundles so I
believe you get a good amount of hair in
each bundle which will be good for any
hair stop you're doing a partial weave
or if you're doing a full wig on a cap
so I plan to do my regular closure with
extensions on a dome cap so that's the
look I'm going for
and 3 bundles is very thick in full and
it should be enough hair for me to cover
the whole entire way cap including the
closure so I'll show you guys if the
closure looks like the closure is pretty
nice guys the only thing my concerned
about the closure is the reinforcement
on around the closure so this is where
the front the closure begins you to get
like a little bit of baby here on the
front right here which I think it's
really nice to have baby hairs I really
don't really use them I use e tuck them
sometimes so I'll probably tuff T's as
well um it's kind of strange how they
constructed this cuz I would think that
the beginning would start right here
which is kind of weird the only thing I
have a problem with it does not have a
supportive band around the perimeter so
therefore this is one of those types of
closures that will tear and I'm afraid
of that because once it tears it kind of
ruins the closure so I'm hoping that it
doesn't tear um and the only con that I
see is that it's really thick
guys this is so thick like I just I
honestly if anyone's looking to buy
clothes off Aliexpress like if you
listen to what I say right now the best
closure survivor Aliexpress tower middle
bar closures or three for closures
because the part is already there so
therefore you have to go and like try to
like party and then try to put water on
it and take a press in are and try to
squeeze it there to make a permanent
part when you get a middle part or
three-part closure it's already
permanently done for you the company's
already done it and therefore your part
is defined and it's there and it's done
and that's why I like it this close that
half of my heads are a middle part
closure so therefore it's on a dumb cap
it's a way I can just turn it to the
middle part and it's perfect
there's nothing wrong with this guys
it's just that you have to manipulate it
by yourself to make it the way you want
I don't know if that's annoying for some
people but it takes it's less work if
it's already if it's already
our three-part closure because you don't
have to do that much work so for this
one I'll be managing this one like I'll
be managing this one pretty roughly but
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine guys I just
thought it was a little bit it should
have been like a middle part or
something like that that's fine I just
worried so much about the density and
fighting with the hair if I have to thin
it out a little bit but like I said it
does look really nice and natural and
I'm pretty sure I could work it out and
this is 18 inches and it doesn't shed
either it's a very nice texture very
pretty wave and it's really nice guys
really really nice so I'm gonna do a wig
on a dump cap with the closure and
everything and just like I obviously
with my units but I hadn't done a
special I'm going to a special thing on
this so I'm gonna color it and make it
like a nice going into the spring look
so you stay tuned for that I will show
you guys a gift that they gave me they
gave me some cute little lashes most out
express space companies do this and they
give you like a little gift that I got
like these cute little lashes um which I
thought was cute I probably would wear
these because these are really pretty
and they're not like they're not like
too dramatic and they're kind of like
wispy like cute little wispy lashes and
I thought that was cute as well so that
kind of wraps up my review guys I hope
