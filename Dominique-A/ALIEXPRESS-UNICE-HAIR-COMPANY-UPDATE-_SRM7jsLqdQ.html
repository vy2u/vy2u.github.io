so I'm here today to do an update video
on this year that i got from the company
called units care company it's been
approximately like two weeks since I've
did the hair review for you guys or
maybe two in like a week I don't
remember whatever so you guys can tell
the hair looks completely different from
what it did the first time I showed you
guys the hair um and yeah I like it guys
it's really nice and it's very light and
pretty um I had like a couple
complications at the hair so um yeah
well both talk to you guys by the
complications first before I talk about
the good things because you guys need to
hear this for me I did get sent this
hair for free for a review so I'm going
to give you guys my honest opinion on
the hair I'm not gonna lie to you guys I
don't want you guys going to swing your
way in here that's going to be garbage
so therefore if you're interested in
this guy stay tuned and keep on watching
looks like guys like I mentioned the
beginning of the video it has been about
like a week or two since I've showed you
guys a hair I did get to 24 inch bundles
1 22 inch 10 and an 18 inch closure the
hair looks absolutely different I did
tell you guys if you guys watch my last
video that I was going to change the
hair up and I did decide to color the
hair and I did actually cut thing here
in my last video my breast augmentation
post-op video the hair was long but I
decided to switch it up a little bit and
cut the hair I cut the hair just because
I felt like the hair was too thin at the
ends and because of the long lengths to
just kind of looked crazy from here to
here so i decided that and my best
benefit was best for me to just to cut
the hair and like I said it's hair I'm
not gonna grow it back I could just buy
it back so it is what it is but like I
did mention two guys that is it I did
get this hair step for review so I'm
gonna give you guys my honest opinion
about the hair there will be no lies in
this video to you guys so if you're very
interested guys you guys just keep
listening and thumbs up this video guys
you guys like it as well so the only
problem i saw with the hair was the
bleaching issue I feel like they was
over it was already processed before I
bleach your hair and the only reason why
I had to do my hair this cause
because the hair was not taking died and
it was over bleaching into an orange
color and no matter what I did to try to
bring the hair to life back from that
orange color I could not do it and
listen I've been bleaching here for
years and years and years I'm not a
beautician I'm not licensed
cosmetologist or anything like that but
I just have you know Common Sense skills
i watch youtube videos and I learn stuff
from people on youtube so I honestly
could not get that hair to come to life
it was this absolutely nasty orange
brass color that I'm like what the hell
so honestly I feel like the hair was
kind of processed before I even touched
it with it with the bleach so therefore
keep in mind when you're ordering on
companies I'll express that you make
sure that you research the company
because some companies will tell you
that their hair is one hundred percent
version here and they're lying as far as
this company is concerned I'm not sure
if I got a bundle bundles of hair that
was already processed like I said I am
NOT a beautician but in my opinion I
feel like the hair was bleached before I
even bleached it or it was processed
before I even touch it so that was only
con the major continent I've seen and
the only reason this is the other reason
why I see a bigger cut another con is
that the hair was shedding it was kind
of like clipping at the ends but I
blamed that because of the processing so
it's not really like I honestly feel if
I didn't diet it probably wouldn't like
shed and would it like kind of like the
split ends when it come off but because
I died here that was already processed I
was getting a lot of split ends so
that's another reason why I decided to
cut the hair now that I have cut the
hair and I machida style I have not
received any shedding with this here
this here holds a beautiful curl it
styles fabulously and I absolutely it's
low maintenance right about now I don't
really have to do a lot to it does not
tangle at all I don't listen guys I
bleached it here and I passes the hair
I'm not getting any tangling I'm not
getting any shedding us right now so i
think it was better idea for me just to
cut it if you're going to get longer
lengths from this hair company i would
suggest that you give four bottles in
here and not three i will send this here
for
you like i said so i just got what i was
given so it is what it is but if you're
planning on bike from this company like
I said it's very inexpensive I would
tell you to buy four bundles in an
enclosure and then you'll have that
complete look that you're going for so
yeah another thing if you guys are I
know like we've been asking questions
about the hair color this hair color is
a medium as brown and a light ash brown
I really like the hair color looks
pretty guys and it um it actually worked
out because I wasn't able to get the
blonde color I was looking for this was
the last resort and I use ash colors
when I'm trying to tone the hair down so
this tone down pretty well there's some
light spots in here that you'll see like
sporadically I mean if I was out in the
summertime right now you probably see a
whole bunch of cut up like low blonde
light like highlights in the hair but
it's really pretty and I feel like it's
not a winter hairstyle it's more of a
spring/summer hairstyle but this is a
wig so I'm just going to wear as I'm
just gonna wear it in the summer so
that's the best part about it and other
than that the hair is really good the
only product that i'm using on the hair
right now is an argan oil and this is
from I got this actually from TJ Maxx
it's about 10 bucks and this is what it
looks like if you go to the like you
know beauty bath and all that kind of
stuff I'll you'll find this it's
excellent it's like an oil-based our
convoy and it's very nice it keeps it
here very silky pretty and soft and I
just use like maybe a dime size on my
hair and then I just call it a day um I
if you guys are interested in the deep
wave pattern or video on how to play my
hair I can most certainly do that just
leave your comments down below and I
will be sure to do that for you guys so
i'll just show you this at the deep wave
looks like because this was one of my
favorite hairstyles for like the spring
and summer it's very effortless it's
very pretty and it's just naturally
gorgeous so this is a deep waver that i
use guys and it's the hotshot tools deep
flavor and I did purchases at Sally's
and if it's not from Sally's try Harmons
beauty of beauty store because they
probably had this as well so this is
what it looks like and it goes up to
about four hundred and forty degrees so
this is a great product so that
basically wraps the video guys if you
guys have any questions or comments
down below I will leave the name of the
hair color down below for you guys I did
get it from walmart and it's part of the
revlon colorsilk collection and it's
very unexpensive it was about two
thousand ninety seven cents for each for
each actual box and I got four so I'd
say guys um if you guys are interested
in this hair the information be down
below as well so yeah thumbs up this
video guys if you guys like it and i'll
see you guys in another one
good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
