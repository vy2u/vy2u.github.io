i'm back with the bold z today if
somebody guys know my hair is actually
short and it's out so i don't even know
how to really show it that much on
youtube it's just because i like to wear
my wig so therefore i do my get my hairs
in like every two maybe two months or
something i'll go get a perm and a
haircut or shape up whatever but I am
just rocking it like a bull tee right
now but yeah so today is another wig
review now this is on equals our lace
front weighed in the Brazilian natural
and this is also one of the lace deep
invisible L parts and the way that I'm
going to be styling for you guys is
Danity wig in color one beat so I got
this off of a stands beauty calm I'll
link there I'll put the link down below
for you guys this is a color number one
and this is very popular wig I wanted to
try something that was a little bit more
straight with a little bit more of a
kinky look to it and this wouldn't had
the look that I was going for this is
also a layered styled wig so therefore I
won't be doing that much weather when it
comes to styling because it's already
styled this is the way guys are just
going to pull the net off for you guys
to see it is kind of like I think this
is like a 16 or an 18 inch styled wig it
has like obviously the long layers
towards the bottom and in the short
fetid layers towards the top I wanted to
try this out just because of the texture
and the fact that I can style it in
numerous ways you guys really know I
don't look baby here's out I will just
put some powder on the part and wear it
to my liking the only good thing about
me is I have a large forehead so me
putting wigs on it actually looks like I
don't have a large forehead so therefore
that's a really really big plus about
wearing wings especially styling
synthetic wings so that it was just an
easier way of by of spending less money
on quality recently I've been into
shopping for synthetic wigs just to show
you guys on my channel about the
possibilities of buying things are
inexpensive and they're fabulous so I'm
going to come I'm going to go and I'm
going to cut the lace off and I'm going
to put it on my head and then just you
know salad up for you guys to see
exactly what it looks like so stay tuned
Oh
so this is basically what it looks like
I didn't really do like an E major
styling today I just added the price
powder then kind of pulled out like
something a little bit of hair to make
it look a baby hairs and talked to
behind my and added like a little bit of
hair there to make give it like a little
bit of style the hair is a good length
it's like 16 to 18 inches long not too
too long
synthetic wigs do come up with like a
little bit shiny or whatever I don't
know if it's because my diva ring light
but in general synthetic wigs do have
like a little bit of an extra shine to
it I do like this wig guys just because
it's a really quick nice and cute style
just around especially if you don't have
a look for the day and you're like
desperately looking for like a cute
effortless style this hairstyle is
really pretty like I said I will go to
sleep at this point I wouldn't go to
sleep without I put on the mannequin
head before I go to bed I wouldn't sleep
in this mad at all up I would use a
paddle brush for this I use my fingers
in the beginning just because it's fresh
so it's easy for my fingers to run right
through it I do really like it guys the
Styles cute it doesn't have baby hairs
as I don't think so I'll add there's
baby hears on the wig but they're very
small baby hairs you can create your own
baby hears with this unit but I do like
it make sure you leave all your comments
down below thumbs up this video and also
subscribe I'm not gonna make this a long
video this is what it is you can do
whatever you want with the week and
we're in a ponytail style of any type of
way this is how I wear this here
obviously with the tough back and just
kind of like that effortless look or
whatever just tell me what you think and
I will catch you guys in my later videos
