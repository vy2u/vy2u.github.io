distracting as I think it is but because
it's the holiday season I gotta come in
here with some spirit so guys today's
video is another fashion Friday video
today's video is another Kirby slash
stick girl trying off now this video
today guys is sponsored by new chic comm
so in this video today kind of showed
you guys some clothes and accessories
and I will leave all the links down
below so if you're interested in any of
these products just click that link and
go direct to the website to purchase now
guys I want you guys to make sure you
watch to the end of the video because I
have this amazing surprise that I got in
the mail and I wanna you know share with
you guys so you guys know what's going
on so if you're interested in seeing
what I have to offer in today's try and
hey guys I would like you to stay tuned
and keep on what so i've conjured up the
guts to keep this on throughout the
whole video so i'm gonna keep it on just
because i don't know I'm feeling really
good it's really late while I'm
recording this video so I'm kind of
patting myself on the back for being up
because I did work earlier but it's the
holidays and I just got to keep pushing
through like honestly once the holidays
are over and I'm back and I'm in January
2018 and not even 2018 next week on
Wednesday the 27th is my birthday so
once I hit my 27th birthday and it's
like New Year's is coming I got plans
with my honey so as soon as all those
events take place and Christmas is
finally over
I think I'll be in a better spirit a
better mood this year I can only say I
wasn't kind of like over spending my
money on gifts and stuff like that so
I'm really thankful that I didn't like
go bananas like I did a few years back
like the last few years because I was
just doing the most this year I was
really modest like nobody none of my
sisters none of us have kids yet so it's
kind of like we're not shopping for like
children and I told them like next year
don't come with this mess unless one of
you guys are knocked up because I'm not
doing this whole gift buying process
again it's just too too much I kind of
feel like the holidays end up being more
about and gifts and it's not more about
family love and stuff like that and I
really wanted this year to be like that
but my sister's like well I want this
listen this and it just turned into a
mess so I'm hoping that next year
somebody like has a kid or something you
know Dhar have a kid or something like
that but next time trying to do a
low-key this year me my sister's at um
out celebrating Kwanzaa and stuff like
that but we actually did well we still
have time because Kwanzaa is December 26
so we can start it then and we should
have kind of done that this year we
always said that we wanted to do that so
maybe next year we start that as a
tradition just because I feel like
Christmas has become more of a
commercial thing it's more about gift
buying being greedy beating up people on
the lines Hawking at people aggressively
on the highway like just it just becomes
so messy I'm just not about that I kind
of feel like if I'm gonna do Christmas
again I'm doing it with my family
like my husband and my children and
stuff like that buy them a gift for two
don't spoil them too much but yeah
that's enough that so I'm gonna show you
guys the coolest first guys I really
like these clothes a lot there's three
pieces in that set I actually really
really like now the other ones mmm
whatever I can do with and I could do
with that but I do have some friends
that would actually like the of it well
I'm I lied I lied maybe I'll take the
back maybe I'll keep I'm lucky bottom oh
that's so greedy so the first thing I'm
going to show you guys it's probably one
of my favorite now when I paired this
outfit up cuz in this video I try to
show you guys like how I would wear it
so most of these outfits I showed you
guys exactly how I wear the outfit so I
hope you guys like that now this here is
the hair that weren't in this video so I
didn't switch up my wigs this time but
this hairstyle for me is very modest and
very cute and sexy so I was like you
know what I'm not gonna keep popping
wigs off today I'm just gonna leave this
one because this one kind of works with
the outfits but keep in mind you can
switch it looks up because you know I
always always do that so the first
outfit that I got is kind of like this
jumpsuit now know chic has like these
weird like when you call the website
they show you kind of like displays at
pictures and the outfits look so weird
and I'm like I'm not about to wear that
so when I was going through and I kind
of saw it the pitch I'm like that looks
like it's like it's like a terrific kid
or something like that
so in this shows hmm I don't think I'm
gonna pick that out so this time it took
a big leap of faith and tried them out
if you go on the website you know
exactly what I'm talking about
it looks like it's a thrift store but
it's not
so this one is that in 3x now I'm gonna
tell you right now do not go on this
website think you bought to fit a size
large or extra-large if that's your
United States size because or if it's
your United States size your UK size or
whatever it is or your Canadian cell
Canadian sized up shut up so don't think
you're about to go on here and just pick
up these office thing and that they're
gonna just fit you regular no I got a 3x
in this now this one I could have got a
2x but I wanted to play safe so it's a
black jumpsuit guys it has like these
fake buttons going all the way down now
it does have two straps and there's two
buttons but one thing is weird one of
the buttons is on the back side and one
is on the front side I don't know if
that was part of the the look but I was
like why would you do that but whatever
it's still cute now it is kind of really
long in there like wide-leg so what I
deal with this one I actually put mines
in my boots and then I kind of put a
little bit on my waist just because it
was really kind of like one of those
saggy kind of loose type of jumpsuits it
almost looks like one of those kind of
fisherman jumpsuits but it's not the
materials kind of a comment here this is
kind but I thought it was so cute so I
try to pair it up with like that gray
top that I got from I believe it was ROS
gal and it kind of had like that kind of
exaggerated kind of like layered top and
I thought it was cute to pair it with
that and just the hairstyle everyday I
was just you know I was just feeling
myself so much I thought that that offer
was really really cute guys and I really
really really really like that outfit
this is big but like I said pairing a
belt off to kind of like pairing a belt
with it to kind of like cinching your
waist and bring the outfit together it
just kind of brought it to life for me
I really really like this out loud this
is probably one of my favorite even with
the boots tucking it into the boots oh
it was so cute now the next one I got is
Jean dress now I love Jean dresses out
with him all season long so this one is
a bit longer and I kind of thought about
it in my head like how am I gonna wear
this one like usually when I wear jean
dresses I wear it with like sandals or
flats and it's getting a little too cold
to be wearing sandals and flats I was
like saying to myself like how am I
about to wear this so I picked up those
boots that I have again those nice
pointy black boots and
these on with it I actually have another
pair of pointy black boots as well to
which I could appear with this too but
so for some reason those boots that I
got from romwe those pointy black boots
they just have this really cute look to
them and because they have a chunky heel
your foot doesn't even hurt so I'm gonna
keep wearing those so this dress is a
three X as well being modest thinks
smart people so this one is a jean dress
it is a little bit of wrinkles when I
showed you guys it but whatever you can
go ahead and steam it I have a steamer
so before I wear this I don't probably
go ahead and steam it just because it
was a little bit wrinkled now it's a
long jean dress they're not false
buttons the buttons all the way up and
tuck from the top to the bottom I kind
of wish the buttons were black instead
of this tan color just because it's kind
of it's kind of weird but beggars can't
be choosers
I thought it was really nice it's
long-sleeve it does have a slit on the
side and has like a little bit opening
on the front now this I also paired with
a nice little skinny belt on the waist
with some boots another favorite now I
just in the beginning when I wore I
thought like I can't wear this out right
now because it's too cold but if you put
some luck you could even put over the
knee heel boots with this when it would
just make it look really sexy and then
kind of open the front of the skirt a
little bit up not up to the point you're
gonna like show too much but just a
little bit up so that you have like a
little bit of a sex appeal the outfit is
on point guys like it fits the body so
nice it's just like a nice relaxed
material it looks really kind of like
you could dress it up or dress it down I
initially thought I was gonna wear this
too like running just like track
sneakers like little what do you call
them like Skippy's or whatever but then
I was like you know let me put some
boots on and put the little sex on this
little sex appeal on it
so I thought it was really really cute
guys this is one of my second favorites
like I like when you go on this left so
you're gonna be kind of like a little
bit weary with the items just because
you're uncertain whether it's gonna be
nice this stuff kind of looks to me like
thrifted items on the website they don't
really have like fashionable models with
some of the items so I was a little bit
nervous but these I would say go ahead
and choose items you want just jumpsuits
especially are so freaking cute
I am a u.s. extra large/1x enlarge so I
size to 3x so I recommend doing 3x so
definitely now the next thing I got
which is one of my favorite like baby
baby baby baby it's so much fun so much
energy in this outfit I just absolutely
love it now this one I say with the
other three I would definitely wear with
this hairstyle it just kind of sets the
outfit off and it's it's a hairstyle
that's not too crazy and if you watch
the video on this unit it should be
posted today you guys are gonna see this
start to finish on this unit and exactly
what I did it's a long top talked
through video so I'm explaining to you
guys in detail what I did this here was
18 inches I chopped this bad boy up so
you guys will see that in the video I'm
not gonna get into it it's just you you
need to really elevate people elevate so
this dress right here guys is definitely
one of my favorites
I might even wear this on my birthday if
I go out to dinner I know I'm going out
to dinner with my boyfriend on next
Friday for my yeah next Friday for my
birthday so I don't know I might even
wear this but for some reason I like to
work I like to dress up wear heels and
stuff like that but it's cold outside
like I'm gonna do that on New Year's do
I really want to do that on Friday like
I don't know but I probably wear
something really cute and kind of like
we're some like booties or something
real simple with it and just make it
real nice and put like a little beat in
here so you know so this dress guys cute
now this dress I got into 2x and the
material is kind of like you can hear
it's kind of like one of those kind of
like I don't know how to explain it you
guys put it down below just write it
like read it calm and just put the name
of what you what it is it's it has a
it's not like it's like a thin material
and it's a type of material when the
wind hits it it like sucks on your body
so if you don't have a bra instead of
like your boobs skin like if you have
like a nice muffin like I do it's kind
of your stomach and like your butt so
it's kind of one of those materials but
the dress so it's basically like one of
those kind of like skit what do you go
skate your skater dresses or kind of
like shift your ass shift dress now the
best part about this Jeff dress guys is
the sleeves oh my god it has like those
tri layered kind of
fanned out like sleeves I wore this one
with the boots again guys and those
boots like I said you gotta find
yourself a really good pair of bad boots
for the wintertime like some badass
boots and like I once I found a pair of
badass boots they will be worn every
single time every outfit I incorporate
that in I'm just gonna wear it like
honestly I love it guys this dress with
those boots was just so oh my god I love
this so much it was kind of like it was
like a dressed-up a casual at the same
time but like it was really elegant with
the dress with the sleeves and stuff it
gave me more of a vibe and like I said
with this hairstyle it was just kind of
real nice clean fresh and just gorgeous
I absolutely love this outfit guys I'm I
know you guys are gonna be like yes that
was really cute like I have a really
simple style like I always tell you guys
like I like to dress you know like a
baddy sometimes and sometimes I like to
just real cute casual and just like real
relaxed real relaxed is basically my
statement like I like to be real relaxed
and I don't like to do too much because
I like to be comfortable a lot this
dress is very comfortable it's really
nice and it has like a great sex appeal
and it definitely has like this cute
vibe to it so I highly recommend you
guys to pick this dress out like I said
this one is a size 2x and it fits
perfect
now the next two things I got so you
guys know I'm kind of like really crazy
about the crushed velvet now I kind of
felt like this dress was a little bit
tight I really wish it wasn't too tight
like it really kind of like exposed my
stomach more than I would like and I
know people gonna be like why are you
talking about but like for me I have
like this thing in my ran like oh my god
a muffin e right now but you know the
girls got her best friend looking like
kind of bloated right now so it is what
it is so this dress is really cute guys
now this one I believe it's a size large
see if they would haven't had it an
extra large I would have gotten an extra
large I probably got to do a couple
crunches but whatever whatever so this
just is another one of those crushed
velvet dresses you guys know I've been
obsessed with that theme it's just I
just love it it's just really cute that
type of that type of theme is going on I
was just everything for me
I love it I absolutely love it so if
this one has a cold shoulder kind of
design on it it has it goes all the way
up to the neck so it's like a turtleneck
it is a mini dress but if you're curvy
many dresses it really exists too much
especially if the dress is form-fitted
because once you walk your curves will
carry the dress up and that's basically
one of my life stories that just happens
to me a lot so that's why I try to stay
away from kind of body contractors or
mini dresses a lot just because with any
type of fluctuation of emotion that you
make anything like that your the dress
is just no longer midi dress it's almost
like a mini dress at the end no longer
midi but a mini wow that would be cute
to put on the shirt that's a good i
thats really cute no longer a midi but a
mini so that's that's what it ends up
being like and i hate having to walk
around like pulling their skirt down
that's just like so annoying so I don't
know it's cute though but to be going
through all that kind of extra mass no
and it is a little bit tight so unless I
get like a nice shapewear that's extra
extra like I don't know if I'm gonna
wear this but I know somebody that would
like to wear this so I might give this
to them because they might not have
anything to wear for New Year's and this
would be a nice New Year's dress to wear
with some really good accessory jewelry
it will be poppin now the next dress I
got I actually liked it in the beginning
but then when I looked at the dress more
and more I was like yo if the material
is a little bit different and it wasn't
so cheap I feel like the dress would
have been like up in the sky but the
material miss dress is a little bit
cheap and it just I don't know and then
like I have this whole thing with like a
lot like I like show my I like doing
like breasts like you know having like a
little cleavage of stuff like that but
these dresses be trying to cut down to
your bellybutton I just feel like why
does suggesting to cut down to my
bellybutton
I am NOT that flat in the midsection
area for you to be cutting down to my
bellybutton just being honest and
realistic like that's not realistic for
everybody so what I had to do with this
dress is being dressed guys they have to
go in and close it up just be not even
close it up off like this close it up a
little bit but I closed it up a little
bit just because it's just too low-cut
and and I don't like wear bras so um
yeah I'm being honest I
like wearing bras like that so it's kind
of like I don't want it was just too
much and there's not enough it is not
supporting it either so it's just kind
of annoying but it's definitely a cute
dress guys it's a green dress it has
like that nice low deep cut and like I
said I went in with some meat on thread
so that bad boy right back up now it's
really cute it has kind of like this
like little waist pan on the front so it
kind of gives you like this it brings
you in my curvy and then gives like this
like a little illusion in the front I
like to dress guys but I kind of feel
like the dress the material of the dress
is really like cheap like if it was not
kind of like a thicker cotton material I
think that it would have passed very
nicely but the material is kind of like
a polyester material and I just feel
like it just I wish I really honestly
and truly wish that it wasn't because
this just will be definitely a really
sexy dress if this wasn't white I would
wear it to New Year's I think that would
be really cute but it's green Green was
the only card they had I wanted to give
it a go it's almost a midi dress as well
with this one but this one you won't
have issues with this when riding up too
much just because it has kind of like
areas where it'll stay like meaning the
way Sierra has kind of a cab an area
that would kind of stay in place so
therefore you won't have it rise up a
lot on you or any of that kind of stuff
but like I said I'm not the biggest fan
of this dress but I actually know
somebody that would actually really like
this dress for New Year's and she
probably look fabulous and I'll probably
give it to someone who would actually
look really good in this one but for me
I just felt that my tears a little bit
less like it's not that great and if
you're someone that has like a lot of
cellulite and like a lot of nooks and
crannies and I know I do it just really
exposes everything so you got to kind of
be you know what you want to look like
you wanna look like a snap you know you
want to look like a Oreo or a saltine
cracker so I don't know yeah I'm gonna
shut up it must it must be because it's
late and I'm just cracking all these
corny jokes but whatever it's the
holidays
hence the headband so the last thing I
got I actually ordered this specifically
from Madre and I ordered this for her
because she was on the website looking
at the stuff and she was all please I
want it so I was like you know what let
me just get it for her so they had in 3x
I'm not sure if they had in 4x or 5x but
um I got in 3x just because I thought
I must have done with me if my mom is
very top-heavy she has large large
breasts so I had to get something that
will really cover her the breast area
for so I think 3x is the largest size
and actually this actually fit her now
this is kind of it's kind of like a kind
of like a jacket like what do you call
it Jack Parker but it's not a real
Parker the material the jacket is
nothing near a parka jacket the inside
it's kind of like this old cheap hole
kind of like you know the mold she
blinks you get and maybe like those nice
soft blankets but you know that material
in anger it's that type of material on
the inside and then when I put my hands
in the pocket I can feel like open spots
in the pocket so I was like I cannot
have my mom walking outside with this
jacket she will freeze to death but
thank God my sister actually got hurt a
nice Michael Kors jacket for Christmas
not Michael Kors she got our guest
jacket for Christmas so she'll get that
for Christmas and she want to wear this
just sporadically around she could just
put it on it was cute if it was
oversized for me but I thought it was
still cute so if I'm just like running
off the house I need a jacket to wear
I'm gonna put this on I thought it was
cute put a little pair of sneakers on it
laggs
o go buy I thought it was really cute
yeah I am I'm just like I don't know why
I'm so energetic right now like I have
so much editing to do before I hit the
sack I don't even know why I make
jumping off the walls right now like
what is going on with me I don't know
but what I think I'm about to do is edit
this video and in that other video when
I come back from the city tomorrow edit
the rest of that video because I really
need to shut these eyes because I'm like
really really dying so this jacket has
cute little pouches on a shelter mat for
fame down and it says army but it's cute
my mom thought it was cute she put it on
she was styling it yeah so you guys I
want I want you guys to meet my mom so
I'm probably gonna do a tag with my mom
I'll probably do like my Haitian tag or
some type of tag now when I do the tag
you guys have to watch it because you
guys have to meet my mom and know
exactly who my mom is
it's you guys you guys will see when you
guys see the tag when I do the tag you
guys will get what I'm talking
she's hilarious so I probably do attack
with my mom and she'll probably talk and
stuff like that and I'll have her
talking Crale and stuff like that so
I'll probably do a time with my mom
she's really sweet and she's always
watching my videos like she's so funny
buddy hi watch your video today so I'm
gonna keep watching it so that you get
more views and I might tell y'all they I
think they can kind of like track down
when you like keep watching a video I
keep telling up she'll be listening to
me what's wrong all right guys moving
along so I'm gonna show you guys one
accessory item that I got from my dog
and I also forgot to show you guys one
more top that I actually tried on that I
actually liked too so this one guys is
this really cute bubble vest jacket that
I got my dog now I know this sounds
corny it's kind of like why is she
dressing up her dog it's not a corny
thing like it's really cold and like
when we take the dog out on walks I just
get like fearful like he's gonna get
sick or something like that so I want to
put like these little hoodies on him I'm
not putting them in like little like
college shirts or whatever like that
like anything corny I actually go to
harm home goods and I don't know if any
of you guys know homeless actually has a
dog section and their dog section has a
variety of dog clothes so I went there
like earlier in the holiday season like
kind of like maybe at the end of
November early early December and I
found like bubble vests for him I found
like these nice fashionable tartan kind
of like throw overs with the hoods like
my dog he's really pimped out and I have
a big dog he's a pitbull but he's only 1
so he's still kind of like a good 25 to
30 pounds so he's not too too big but
he's kind of lean and like kind of like
brolic he's not like too buff you know
like oof like not that type but he's
kind of lean and long so I can buy
outfits that will work for him I'm not
buying sneakers or like you know like no
jean shorts or anything but I just keep
him clothed on the top just because it's
really cold outside so I picked this
little bubble desktop and I think this
is gonna fit him not that look at it so
this one is in a 4x out and I don't know
if that's how they they size them on
this website but I guess they measured
it that way so this is a 4 XL obviously
this is the front part this is the
bottom of his breast bone part right
here and this will be on his back I
actually believe that this will fit my
dog so I'm crossing my fingers
if it doesn't then it's fine they do put
the two hooks on here so if you want to
attach instead of putting the actual
chain on his collar you can actually
hook it from the back which I thought
was really cool but at the same time I'm
not gonna pull my doll from back here
it's it's better to pull from actually
with the college that because you have
more control the dog he can just slide
right out it is out of this thing and
just go running but I thought this was
cute and this was actually inexpensive
on the website and I will let you guys
know if this fits
I my dog he actually loves likes this
stuff like he will not let you take it
off after he's worn it for a few hours
he will not let you take any of his
clothes off like he's like like Dead Set
wearing those clothes those office out
of I am so I don't know if you have a
dog that likes stuff like that and they
don't care and they like it for the
warmth then definitely pick those I
think that was like five dollars like
I'm like come on like the ones I get at
home goods obviously Rancho Mike $15
teen dollars 225 but they're really nice
so definitely check out home goods
because they have a wide variety of
doggy clothes now the last type that I
want to show you guys to in the clothing
haul Tryon portion is this cute little
top now I got this top and a size extra
large and I think extra large was the
largest size they had because if they
had like two X or 1x out we've got the
1x
for some reason the sleeves on this are
extremely it's not extremely tight
they're just tight and I just don't like
that I was almost like at the point of
cutting the inner part of the sleeve
just to kind of widen it a little bit
now this is a cute shirt it's
see-through it's like it's kind of
parsley see-through I would say like 60%
like 70% see-through so if you were a
black bra you won't be able to see it
but I feel like if someone flashes the
picture of you you'll be able to see
your breasts but I do like this a lot
the best part of this top guys is the
back the back has an open keyhole at the
top and then it has like a open hole I
mean I can opening at the bottom so if
you want to show that small back this
summer then you definitely get away with
it showing it with this top it's really
cute just have like a little button in
the back just put it in together but I
just do it over my head and fit fine but
the problem with this one guy says the
sleeves are just a little tight so what
I'll probably do is just cut right here
at the seam right underneath the armpit
area to kind of widen it out so that
it's not too tight on my arms cuz that's
just like the worst thing when your arms
are like like you know it expresses I
got chunky arms I got meaty arms so it's
when it's tight you just feel like
really weird so if you ever have that
issue put a jacket on because that
always works but I thought that this was
really cute guys and it's just really
cute black on black everything black pop
it so I thought that was cute I want to
show you guys that one as well alright
guys so the last four items that I want
to show you guys are some backdrops now
when I was on the website I went through
the accessories section and I was
looking at just random stuff so I've
never picked backdrops from this website
or any website so I wanted to pick them
up from this one I usually film on my
back like this kind of scenery right
here I just think it's really nice and
cute and obviously I have that nice
little tree that I actually put on the
wall kind of like a tree accessory and I
got this from Walmart knows about like
ten bucks so I just kind of do like kind
of casual like scenery like this so I'm
trying to switch it up a little bit I
did some videos when I had backdrops on
my other back wall over there and I kind
of got those from Walmart and I kind of
made them myself some of them so I
wanted to try something different by
using backdrops for that we're already
pre-made from a website crossing my
fingers that one of these mofos get me
some for Christmas but yeah hopefully so
I'm gonna show you guys that the
backdrop looks like now I don't like on
the website the backdrops look really
good but for the price I kind of thought
about it after light they really gonna
charge a little bit of money for a
backdrop No
so if you guys know any places that do
that's all really nice backdrops for a
good prices leave them down below for me
so I can kind of amplify my chin up a
little bit but I do like this kind of
like casual scenery I just I don't know
I'm just like so boring I like this
little casual scenery kind of like
regular in my home comfortable Dom and
just all that extra stuff I'm just not
really into it so I'm trying to do more
for my channel for the year 2018 so if
you know any places I sell backdrops
leave it down below
now these backdrops guys they're really
big so I'm gonna hold I'm gonna show you
guys portions of them so you guys can
see and I hope I have all because I feel
like I'm missing one if I'm missing one
guys I'll still look it down below you
check it out yourself
so the first backdrop I guess this one's
supposed to be kind of like a Christmas
themed backdrop I'm not sure so what I'm
gonna do I'm not gonna hold them up I'm
gonna actually show you guys them on the
side screens take a picture of them so
this one is for some reason the
back jobs like they don't look clear
that's the issue that I have with the
backdrops they're not clear at all
they're like really like kind of
funny-looking and I don't know I just
kind of feel like for a backdrop it
should kind of have some type of
personality this one is kind of like a
light backdrop but I like a wood wall it
fits for me it just wasn't working guys
I can't see the it's like really blurry
and I don't see the real like picture
view so I don't know I'm just not
feeling this at all guys and I don't
know now the next one is supposed to be
kind of like a diamond theme like a lot
of diamonds crystals I don't really see
the diamonds and crystals in this one I
feel like it's really blurry it's
unrealistic looking and it's just not
giving me any type of vibe that I like
honestly I'm going to take a picture and
show you guys all the backdrops in the
back honestly you guys some what you
guys think I personally would not spend
my money on that I should have stuck
with some clothes because that's what I
really like but I was trying to be extra
and I was trying to pick up stuff
thinking like oh this is gonna work but
it's not so I'm gonna be completely
honest with you the backdrops for me
we're just not they weren't working so I
will put the backdrops up and I'll stand
in front let me show you guys do they
look like do a little face or whatever
but I'm not really a big fan of the
backdrops they just kind of like we're
cheap looking to me and they weren't
done well but I will show you guys what
they look like you guys tell me what you
guys think guys so basically that was it
for the trying portion of this video and
the kind of Show and Tell of this video
so I know you guys are probably like
what's the huge announcement what news
do you have for us what surprise so on
Wednesday I got a knock on my door and
frequently I get packages like every
single day honestly the only dad will
get packages probably Saturday or Sunday
but Monday through Friday I get a
package or two every day so um I think
it was anything usually my sister gets
to her amazon she'll get stuff from
Amazon they'll deliver it and they'll
usually leave it outside but I got this
knock on the door this time and I looked
out I'm thinking suck another Amazon
pack but then I saw YouTube on the box
so I'm like okay so what is this gonna
be today so initially I kind of forgot
that I hit the hundred thousand
subscribers something like saying to
myself okay I don't know maybe they sent
me something like a note or whatever so
I'm gonna pick up the box and like oh
this
unusually heavy so I opened the box guys
and guess what I got so I didn't get the
chance to hang this up yet just because
I want to wait till I move to hang it up
because I'm trying to move and get like
my own office space so depending on how
many bedrooms we get like you guys will
one that when that time comes you guys
will see everything
I will actually vlog it and show you
guys how I do everything so I'm probably
gonna wait till I actually moved to put
this up my sister's like on watches put
it up now I'm like uh I just I'm just so
nervous it's just so pretty I don't want
to touch it but in honor of you guys I
have to show it to you guys because you
guys are the reason why I got this way
like oh this is Kay you know funny I was
in tears like I honestly like I said to
you guys in the beginning when I
initially hit the hundred thousand
subscribers I was kind of like in a in
like this state of like like I was just
kind of like did this like I kind of
felt like it what's it happening to me
like I I don't know
but when I open this guy's I was in
tears you guys don't understand Alyssa's
ears like I would my cousin she just
can't she's here from France and she was
looking looking at me laying okay and I
can't really understand her that well
cuz I don't speak French and like she's
straight French so to me I'm like having
to like really listen to her talk to
kind of try to hash up the worst but
some of that can kind of figure out so
like she was looking at me like oh my
god so guys I'll show you guys so I left
it in the pack so I finally got my
youtube plaque so it says Dominic a
congratulations on passing a hundred
thousand subscribers oh yeah yeah that
is crazy guys crazy crazy crazy crazy
crazy I'm trying not to cry but like
y'all don't understand like this year

of overwhelming stuff like a lot of
stress work and stuff like that in my
mind I was stuck at it when I got the
hundred thousand subscribers I'm sitting
