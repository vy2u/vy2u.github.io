today with another curvy slash thick
girl trying haul so today it's gonna be
a swimsuit trying all featuring romwe
calm so I did get sent some accessory
items as well and a few clothing items
but unfortunately the clothing items
just did not make the cut for this video
so I transformed the video into a
swimsuit try on haul video for you guys
today
so I will leave all the information down
below if you're interested in purchasing
any of these swimmer items from romwe
comm and if you're interested in seeing
what I have to offer in today's trying
haul guys I would like you to stay tuned
and keep on watching alright guys so the
first time soon I'm gonna show you guys
I really really like it's super duper
cute so this swimsuit is like an Aztec
print swimsuit it has high waisted
bottoms with a bikini top so this one's
really cute guys it's like a yellow
orange black and green color pattern
style I think this is really cute though
guys because they add a little bit of
details to the side so how does not like
that crisscross detailing on the side to
give just a little bit of sex appeal
which I thought was nice now the top is
really sexy as well too it has that
crisscross detailing going down the
chest area it does have a little string
in the back that ties in the back and
the top is very comfortable and secure
it does have padded cuffs in the boob
area which is good if you're someone who
has hard nips all the time but I think
that this fits very well I got this in
the size extra large I think it
contoured the body pretty well and kind
of slim me out a little bit and just
made me look really good I feel
SuperDuper confident in this one and I'm
definitely gonna recommend purchasing
this one from this company just because
it's well-made and it's well thought-out
like it's just so cute this is a second
bathing suit that I absolutely love as
well so this one is a polka dot style
high-waisted black and white bathing
suit now with this one when I first saw
it on the website I was a little
skeptical I didn't know if it was gonna
be nice but I actually tried this out
because patterns are kind of trending
right now so I want to keep it in like a
pattern style trend so this one is
really cute guys it's a polyester
material but it's double double lined so
this is probably the best style in that
style
yeah best style or construction of a new
suit that I like so it's kind of like a
polyester and it's double line so
therefore it gives you like a lot of
suckage and you're not looking like
sloppy and kind of lumpy and shit like
that so it definitely covers really well
it is a high leg one so therefore you do
get kind of like a high
cut on it and if you haven't the side
fat pockets your fat pockets would be
showing but I guess fat pockets are kind
of in trend right now but I do think
that these are really cute the top is
also cute too it has like little ruffles
on the sleeves which gives it a little
bit of character I just have pads or
come dependent they have the pads inside
of the breast area but if you don't need
them you could just slip them out they
have like a little area in the back
where you can just pull them out this is
SuperDuper comfortable guys it is a
little bit on the sexy side just because
the bikini top point is really low so
you have like a lot of like boob
spillage but if you're going to a place
that's kind of like pg-13 I wouldn't
wear this but if you're going to like a
pool party with a bunch of friends your
age and it's cool to wear this but I do
think that this is a really nice set and
this is probably like my favorite one of
my second favorite size guys so the next
two swimsuits I'm gonna show you guys
are kind of similar and color but I'm
trying to step out and do get more color
instead of just doing like black
swimwear because a lot of my swimwear is
like black so the first I'm gonna show
you is kind of popular on their website
it's actually popular on a lot of other
websites so it's a two-piece high thigh
high waisted type swimsuit it's like
this orange tangerine color so the back
gives you a little bit of full coverage
this one actually fit a little bit
tighter than I wanted I got this in a
size extra large and I felt like it was
a little bit too tight but I did like
how it fit they'll kind of secured and
covered everything so the top is kind of
like a sports bra style top and has like
the racerback the top fit very well it
does have the inserts in the top but you
know you can just pull the inserts out I
actually like this a lot guys I wish
that they added a little bit more
material in the front area just to cover
all aspects of like your fat pockets and
stuff like that but other than that I
think it looks really good on my skin
complexion and it's just type it's the
type of bathing suit that you can wear
and be very very comfortable in like all
year round so the second bathing suit
I'm going to show you guys is this
orange one too so like I said it's
similar to the other orange one but this
one's a little bit brighter so this is
also the same concept I got this in the
plus-size section a size extra large so
it's a really really bright orange color
it's a high thigh high waisted style
bathing suit you did get a lot of
high-waisted areas in the front the back
for me is a little bit loose like I
don't know this swimsuit was a little
bit too big I could have size down in
the bottom
I do think it's a nice swimsuit it has a
tube top style top like I said it's a
little bit big but it does fit just
enough to kind of you get away with it
to make it look like it fits but I do
like this one it doesn't come with
straps in it or inserts at all or did it
come with interest and I pull the
inserts out I think I pulled the inserts
out of this one because you don't really
need it but I'm a super duper
comfortable there is no straps on this
one so you definitely have to make sure
your things are situated perfectly on
there because you don't want to jump
into a pool jump up and then your
swimsuit is like all the way down but
it's pretty secure and I think that that
one is an excellent choice as well so
this next one I'm gonna show you guys
it's super duper cute so it's a
one-piece suit and it's like
color-blocked so it does have this nice
little crisscross design in the middle
part to give you kind of like a little
bit of sex appeal and it's slightly high
leg but it's not too high legs so it's
kind of comfortable so on the sides it
does have the crisscross detail as well
it's a one-piece so you can kind of just
jump into this the reason why I really
like this a lot guys its kind of what
it's often it's one shoulder so you get
one side which is your left side and
then the other side is just kind of like
off the shoulder it does have padding
insult inserts inside but you can pull
them on as well it's super super
comfortable when I initially put it on
it was super duper tight I do feel like
the top is tighter than the bottom the
bottoms are kind of loose so that's a
little that's one thing I think that's a
little bit annoying just make the entire
bathing suit one size don't try to do
like a big top and like a little bottom
when it's a one-piece it makes no sense
but other than that I thought that this
was really cute the color-block that
they did on it was pretty cute it's kind
of like one of those Tam colors and like
a powder pink at the bottom which is
kind of an odd mix but it definitely
goes really well with my skin tone so I
definitely think that this is a great
swimsuit I got this one in a size large
and it fit pretty well it was actually
white so I'm not gonna hold it up too
close cuz it'll wash me on the camera
but this is a cute one guys it's a
pinstriped white swimsuit with black
stripes and it has like red trims around
it and it says u.s. 1984 this is also
one of those high leg style swimsuits
guys so if you're someone that's
literally insecure about the high light
thing I don't really think you should
try this one just because it goes up
pretty high it does kind of have like a
nice scoop in the back
and it goes into like a semi full bottom
slash kind of like thumb style bottom
but it's not anything too crazy this one
does come with the padded inserts inside
but you can pull them out it definitely
has a great hold on the breast area so
there's definitely a good coverage on
the breast area this I can say is a
pg-13 swimsuit to wear it's kind of sexy
but not too sexy so you can get away
with this one just about anywhere you go
so I definitely think that this is
really cute guys definitely check this
one out so sue is actually white as well
so I'm not gonna hold it up to the
screen because it'll wash me out so this
is another two-piece swimsuit guys but
this one almost looked like it was kind
of like a nightie so I'm probably not
gonna wear this as it swims so probably
just Withers to go to bed and make it
like my pajama set so it's super duper
cute guys it comes with this nice little
ribbed style so it does have buttons in
the bikini top section it does have like
a little bit of a button on the bottoms
now the bottoms were a little bit too
big for me I got this in a size large
I wish the bottoms were size like medium
and the tops a to size large now they
are very it's actually double lined as
well - I'm not gonna lie it's actually
double lined it's like a cotton material
it's ribbed it looks good it fits the
body nice but like I said it's not the
type of material I would wear to go
swimming I just kind of feel like for
swimming purposes you shouldn't wear
something like this this is where I'm
gonna turn into like my pajama set so
I'm probably gonna just wear this as a
nightie or whatever but it's really cute
guys it's very soft and it looks great
on you can tap a button the breast area
closed but my boobs are a little too big
so I couldn't really close them that
well but it just crushed me up and made
me look crazy so I wore it the best way
I could so definitely check this piece
out you can convert it into swimwear
make a swimwear or night wear so I'm
just gonna turn mines in tonight okay so
this next time sue I'm gonna show you
guys a super duper cute so it's kind of
like a tropical style swimsuit so it is
high-waisted I got this in the plus-size
section in a size 0 XL which is an extra
large so it's green it has like a 4c
type of theme it also comes with this
little gold attachment right here in the
middle which is really cute I love gold
accessories so that one's definitely a
plus for this one now it does have a
nice wide band in the back so it's great
for support if you have like back fat or
back rolls the definitely cover up a
little bit of that so it does have the
high waisted bottoms as well too now the
high waisted bottoms are nice
like this is a size large I lied so the
front is cute guys it has this little
detailing right here it still kind of
splits off in here
I like that sometimes on these types of
swimwear because it gives you more of a
shape but this is very cute guys as a
full bottom very comfortable very
conservative I definitely think this is
like a pg-13 swimsuit you can wear it
just about the last swimsuit that I'm
going to show you guys I actually had to
mix mix match this one because the top
didn't fit so I swapped it out for a top
that I ordered from Amazon so it's not
gonna be the same bathing suit but I
want to give you guys an idea of what I
liked so this is a yellow bathing suit
guys it's really cute yellow is very
trendy now this is a high-waisted bottom
the suit came in extra large but the top
was just it didn't fit so I didn't show
it so I found a way to convert the
outfit to make it different so this is
the bottoms it's a high-waisted yellow
bikini bottom it doesn't have high leg
it just covers full coverage the thing I
don't really like about these kind of
yellow colors or white cause if you have
like a pouch like I do it does really
kind of prominently put the pouch out
there but it's something just have to
deal with but I do feel really confident
in this one suit so I did pair it off
with this teeny-weeny eeny bitty itty
bitty itty bitty bikini top now it does
cover just enough of the nipple area
it's not good I'm not gonna say it's
like the most appropriate but it
definitely has sex appeal too and I do
like it so this top is in a size extra
large as well so I just paired them
together it went well it look nice now
still link the information down below
for this swimsuit if you guys want to
purchase it but I didn't like the top
the top arrangement was just not good so
I had to swap it out and do a little
Mitch match but overall I do think it's
still cute so the next few things I got
are some accessory items so I'm gonna
start off with this cute bag that I got
now I'm obsessed with kind of like bags
like this that I kind of have like a lot
of character to it
I thought that this was really cute
because I do have some occasions I'm
gonna go on so I want to find something
that's a little bit dressy not overly
dressy but dressy and fun so this is a
cute little side bag I love crossbody
bags they're my favorite things to wear
and I always wear as cross aside a
crossbody but whatever so this is what
it looks like it's floral it's really
cute it does have like these little
tassels at the opening area inside it
does have like a mini mini pocket if you
want to add like your card in there or
anything like that and it does kind of
shut closed as well too so you don't
have to worry about this sliding open it
does come with a great gold detail chain
which I love gold so that was just an
extra plus
you think that this is cute and it was
really inexpensive on the website so
definitely check this one out now I also
picked out this cute little lemon purse
now I thought this was cute crossbody
bag I mean so this one doesn't have any
pockets on the inside of it it's just
really simple just to put like maybe
like a small camera of vlogging camera
some carts and cash and gum and a
lipgloss and you'll be good I thought
that this was a great deal guys and I
Stiles that oh my god this is so
freaking cute so I picked this out it is
a crossbody bag but you're gonna have to
adjust the strap really well I feel like
the strap is a little bit too little so
I'm gonna have to adjust this just to
make sure that it goes on me the proper
way love to lemon a theme so I had to
pick this one alright guys so that
basically wraps up today's video I hope
you guys enjoyed today's try at home I
hope you guys liked all the items I had
to show it wasn't really an extensive
kind of video today I did get ton some
clothes but the clothes just did not
turn out good at all so I'm not gonna
waste your time show you guys that
