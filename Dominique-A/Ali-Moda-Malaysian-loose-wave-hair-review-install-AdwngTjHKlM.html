today with another hair of you and this
hair view is brought to you guys by Ally
moto hair company of Aliexpress they did
contact me recently and asked me if I
wanted to do a review for their hair so
I was like yeah of course
so the hair that they sent me is the
Malaysian loose wave hair I got four
bundles in here in a closer and I came
this cute little tack right near a lot
of these companies are spending it in
these little packs oh yeah so our four
bundles in our to 22 inches 120 and 118
inch and a 16s closure so I'm just gonna
pull these out second show you guys and
I did get a pair of lashes which is
pretty dope I don't do little single
lashes but I mean if I want to try to be
fancy or try to do something different I
probably do the single ashes but they do
give you single lashes with it which I
thought was really cute so I did have a
one bundle which I'm gonna show you guys
first and this one bundle is just the 22
inch since I got to 22 inches I wanted
to I Ravel one of the bundles and showed
you guys what the bundle looks like so
this is the bundle right here um it's a
pretty good bundle I like the weft the
Westing on the hair because the Westing
on the hair is not too hard like when
you have a really hard wrap that's
really hard to stick the needle through
it and this is actually pretty good
enough it's well good enough for you to
stick a needle through so this is what
the bundle is doubled meaning I got
double them up yeah what's what kind of
like an acquired set so I double this I
just folded it twice so this is what the
hair looks like and this is the 22 inch
one thing I did notice about the hair
after I did Co wash it is that the ends
are kind of straggly I'll probably have
to cut them off or I don't know because
I am gonna bleach this well if it looks
like this now I hope that when I bleach
it it doesn't look like that cuz that's
just not gonna work for me but the hair
is very soft it does kind of have like a
little smell but what do you expect when
you're getting hair like this I'll
Express hair period just has kind of
like a little bit of a singe to it so
this does carry this tinge as well but
honestly the hair quality is really nice
I like the softness it does have a
minimal wave pattern it is loose wave I
hope that when I bleach it doesn't lose
its wave pattern I mean it's not really
a
abundant wave pattern anyways I'm just
saying like when I bleach I hope that it
doesn't kind of take away the pattern I
am gonna be stay here until blonde color
so that's what I'm really more excited
about doing like a blonde unit because I
have a whole bunch of units that are
like black ma I like I kind of like a
curly blonde blue and stuff like that so
I wanted to try something like a nice
straight long blonde ombre or balayage
look I will kind of give you guys to
show you guys clips on how I bleach it
and stuff just so you guys can get kind
of like a point and I am gonna tone it
because when you're buying these type of
virgin hair they always gave you that
yellow color that I absolutely hate so
I'm just got pull out another 22 inch
bun I'm just gonna show you guys what
the pattern looks like they all look the
same so I really don't have to pull
everything off for you guys to see every
single thing so this is the 22 inch
bundle when it's just before this is the
bundle just naturally out of the pack
and this is the pattern it comes if you
guys aren't familiar with on patterns
like this these patterns are steam
pressed so don't think that the hair is
going to look like that once you put it
in your head once I run my fingers
through it the hair will kind of kind of
split up like this so that's it looks
like but like I said guys the hair is
very soft and I have not received any
shedding whatsoever from these bundles
at all so the hair is absolutely soft
guys like I said that ends took a little
bit hmm but maybe a little bit of deep
condition it will help that out so I'm
not too worried about that I'm just more
worried about the bleaching process but
don't worry you guys I'll show you guys
how the Beeching process turns out the
closure looks like simple closure the
closure does carry the same kind of wave
pattern and this is a little bit more
loose just because it's not bundled up
and it's just flat
I mean I'll Cole just come like that so
this is what the closure looks like in
its loose wave as well guys and I do
like this closure because it does have a
reinforced boundary so you won't get
tearing from the lace if you're pulling
needle through which I like so this is
it has nice border on it which I
absolutely like it does coat hat it does
carry baby hairs in the front which are
just iffy and this is the pattern as
well too and like I said I will pull it
out this pattern kind of looks like a
body wave pattern but once you pull it
out it kind of is good loose wave
pattern as well so the closure and the
bundles matched perfectly
not getting any shedding from the
closure or the bundle so that's a plus
plus plus and yeah so if you guys want
to see more of the video and see high
bleach and with any results or stay
tuned and keep on watching as far as I
remember these are just about all the
products that I need I decided to get
the kaleidoscopes color the lighter
colors Wow because this one gives you
some different levels of blondes so I
thought this would be better to use and
it was quite the expense so I also got
this Clara this lightening activator so
it brings the color up to seven stages
so I'm gonna actually mix this in the
powder because I don't want to be
sitting here for hours trying to lift
the color so yeah and then I got 40
bombs developer which is a maximum lift
and then you got your old plain black
reusable latex gloves so I'm going to do
the bleach process first so these are
the items that I'm using and you can get
these from Sally's Beauty Supply Store
alright guys so these are the bundles
after I finished bleaching and dyeing it
I did have to add a box tied to and I'll
show you guys what I use so I ended up
using the Revlon color silks box dye and
dark ash blonde number 60 I have to use
this on it after I use the Wella charms
T 18 because I just wanted to kind of
like bonafide the color a little bit so
if you look at it right now the color is
kind of like a dirty blonde color this
will look really nice in the light once
it dries I will show you guys what it
looks like but this is what it looks
like boys come back and I install the
hair and and I'm all the but I use all
the bundles of hair and I did use a
closure so I made this unit on a dome
cap and elastic band like I always do
I'll show you guys what the closure
looks like to start off just because so
this is a closure right here right guys
it does come a baby hairs around the
perimeter but I'm not too interested in
the baby hairs I did bleach the closure
and I try to leave as much black spot
out of here obviously I couldn't went
down more but this actually looks
gradual so I'll kind of leave it like
that because it doesn't look like a
blunt ombre it looks kind of like a
gradual ombre so I'm okay with that
I did add a little bit of concealer on
the closure just to give it more of a
realistic look so the hair is body wave
I will insert a picture or a video clip
of me
with the hair actually straightened out
and curled the hair is absolutely
freaking gorgeous guys and I've seen a
lot of videos on YouTube of other people
who perceived the Malaysian loose wave
hair or any type of alimony hair and
they've complained about the bleaching
process and how the hair is horrible I
did not experience that with this hair
and I'm being so honest I'm not I know I
was sitting in front of you but I'm
trying to keep it a hundred percent with
you guys because I did before I accepted
the opportunity to do this hair review I
wanted to go on YouTube and look for
videos of people who have reviewed this
hair so I've seen a whole bunch of
videos of other people and I've seen
complaints and I've seen positive things
so I just wanted to actually review this
hair for you guys so you guys can get my
honest opinion and I'm telling you right
now like you can see that here in full
flesh right now I did not have any any
problems with this hair the hair is
beautiful the coloring that dye
everything just took so well I get so
many compliments just from this unit and
I'm happy that I went with the loot
Malaysian blue suede because Malaysian
loose wave you can style it different
ways if you want to wash your hair and
you just want to UM wear it wavy you can
watch the hair at nighttime let it sit
put a little bit of argan oil in it and
let it air dry or what I do is I
actually just take it when after I wash
I just pop it on my head I put some
argon oil my um hair and then I just
kind of diffuse it and then I let it air
dry and this is the result that you get
from just doing that this hair is ha ok
guys like this is like it so um
basically I don't get any tangling I
don't get any shedding I don't get any
of that kind of mess the hair just sits
on my wig it sits on my head and it just
goes with the wind it doesn't I don't
see any problems with this hair like a
curls beautifully like I have curls I
get curls in the curls last days and
days and days and even when it comes to
straightening the hair the hair
straightens bones straight and it stays
bone straight so I use all four bundles
and I did use the closure so this is how
full the hair is I will show you guys
the length of the hair the hair is
pretty long guys so this is the length
of the hair and you can see
ends right here guys the ends are so so
pretty so if you guys don't like kind of
like that I mean it to me has like a
little bit of like a frizzy look but the
frizzy look I really don't care about
because it looks more natural really
nice hair it's not always gonna be like
like silky straight and glamorous this
is virgin hair so I'm just gonna wear
whatever virgin hair where I want to but
with this one if you have a little
problem with the frizziness or if you
think it's frizzy I would just recommend
doing a little bit of argan oil and
water mixed up together and then just
applying it to the hair just to keep it
nice and maintained for me this is
perfectly fine I really don't have to do
anything after I dive in here and
installed it that was it for me I don't
have to do any extra processes I don't
do anything extra with the hair I will
just wash it and then keep it pushing so
yeah and I was supposed to add some
clips in of me actually dying in here
but I failed to do that just because the
process was taking longer than I
expected
and I had things to do so I was just
like this so I will link oh I will
leave a link down below for my previous
video when I bleached
uhm the curly Julia virgin hair I used
all the steps in that video the same
steps I use in this video but the only
difference for this video is that I use
the weather charms t18 and said the t14
and another thing that I did in this one
is I also use BOTS die instead of I use
Box die and usually I never use Box die
so yeah oh my god I so loud outside okay
so that's about it guys so I want you
guys thumbs up this video make sure you
leave all your comments down below and
also subscribe if you have it already
and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
