do a quick review and this reviews for a
company called jeezy sunshine hair
company and this company is off of
Aliexpress they contacted me through my
youtube channel and asked me if I wanted
to do a review for their hair company
and I gladly agreed they sent me three
pieces and the three pieces I got was an
18 inch 22 inch in a 26-inch virgin
peruvian straight hair it's really nice
hair guys the hair has a really pretty
texture and I really like it so far I'm
not into getting a lot of different
patterns in the wintertime just because
having straight here it's easy just for
you to go and do whatever you want with
it and let you guys know I repeat this
all the time I like to curl my hair deep
wave my hair and just work straight so
when you have different types of curling
products or different types of heat
products as a matter of fact that
curling one or something like that it's
easier for you to manage with straight
hair so you can do different styles so
that's what I do and that's exactly why
I got the hair and straight this time
around this is the body weight here that
I had it before and you guys know
everything about this hair and I do my
final review on this hair so it's time
for me to take this out and start
something new so um they came in to
fedex and you know what the Fed Ex bag
looks like i'm not going to go through
all that the hair is really package real
nice it comes in three plastic bags and
this is how the plastic bag came the bin
says sunshine here but like i said is GZ
sunshine here you also give you a label
right here and they just they tell you
the link the texture and the style and
it's really nice that they give it to
you they also have that scanning code
right here so for all you guys who have
a high tech phone that can actually scan
this barcode or this little you be
whatever you call whatever code this is
if you for all you high tech people you
guys can scan this and I don't know what
comes up but try it also they're on
Facebook so follow them on Facebook I
sunshine here and they also have someone
else on YouTube that actually did a
review on this here so
you don't believe my review you can go
check out Herman view I won't link her
name down below but just type in
sunshine here company you'll find the
reviews so i probably be like one of the
few people that review this here so
it'll be good for you guys to know
because i know like people go on Alex
press and don't don't know what to buy
so this will be something that you guys
can check out and if you guys like this
hair company you guys probably go out
and feel safe buying this hair i'm going
to give you guys my honest opinion on
this here i'm not going to lie to you
guys I don't want you guys to go out and
waste your money on here especially
because this hair is deliberate on the
pricier end but for all the know we're
going to see if it's worth it I mean
pricey I mean I don't know what my
definition of prices because I'm pretty
cheap so I think price is more than two
hundred dollars for hair because I like
to get a bargain here and usually when I
get here for bargain it usually works
out for me and my benefit so um that's
my opinion but you can check them out
they have a lot of different textures
and styles and I still happen to pick
this one I opened up this this photo
right here is actually the 18-inch
bundle but i'm going to show you what
the 22 inch looks like and with the 26
inch sub sites so i got 18 22 and 26 so
this is what the 22 inch but it looks
like the texture is very pretty it's
kind of like as yaky texture very nice
and soft it's not silky and has a nice
luster and like a nice pattern it's
straight hair but usually all straight
here as like a natural like dip in it
which is really nice i'm not saying that
you should wash your hair and then just
blow dry and walk out with like that
because it's going to look crazy but
just in the beginning it just it's
really soft it doesn't have a smell or
anything like that and there's no
shedding no tangling no nothing and when
i usually buy when i used to do my hair
I never ever seal the west and I never
ever co watching here but this time
around I'm going to do everything
different so um so far so good it's like
butter your hands run through it so
nicely it's so pretty and it smells
absolutely terrific and this is a 22
inch bundle for some of you guys that
didn't know and the 22 inch windows
comes
leg to your belly button now the next
one is the 26 inch bundle and the 26
inch bundle is very long I am getting a
little bit of a snag in it but I'm
pretty sure that's because I hear it's
really long the hair is actually thin
thick from the top to the bottom which
is really good so you're not getting
that really thin thin hair the longer
hair you get the less here you get in
the bundle so this bundle look very
minuscule the 22 inch bundle looks up a
little bit minuscule but not as
minuscule as the 26 inch bundle so this
should be good enough for a full bundle
for a full head of weed and I don't do
forehead wheels i used to do three
bundles with a closure for money to the
closure or i do like some type of thing
but this time around I'm going to do a
chinese bang when long straight hair I
thought that would be really cute for
the winter time so that's what I'm going
to do and this is right here is the 18
inch bundo very nice as I said before
nice texture and I hope you have to see
the texture to the camera it's really
pretty and all together you can see the
18 inches you get a lot more here 22
inches a little bit more here and 18
inches less hair so all in all this
should be enough for a full bundle of
hair plus a closure but I'm going to do
a chinese bang and I have some other
virgin here that I got from a different
company that I'm going to add in the
front to make a really nice cute thin
but no not a Nicki Minaj or blac Chyna
bun bang just a very cute nice skinny
bangs that are too puffy because I don't
like that look so it's going to be very
nice and chic so I'm going to do this on
a dome cap I know the cop the sizes are
kind of different it kind of jumps very
far through so it goes 18-22 in 26 the
reason why it did that is because I have
an extra bone over here from a different
company that I'm going to add in and the
extra here that I have is a virgin
malaysian straightener and it's 24
inches so this is virgin peruvian and
this is 18 22 and 26 I don't necessarily
think that the textures have a the
brands like Brazilian relay
have a different feel they're about the
same in texture so I didn't think it
would be kind of awkward to put those
three all these four burners all
together but I want there to be very
long and very thick so I wanted to add
four bundles in it so i will be
contributing another bundle that I had
that was sent to me from a different
company into this this bundle and i will
link all that information for that
fourth bundle down below in the
information box so so far the hair is
really nice and really pretty nice
texture beautiful luster zero shedding
and zero tangling and i am going to seal
the web so hopefully this hair stands up
i did go to walmart i bought fray check
and i'm going to use a frayed trek to
seal the West this is about three
dollars at Walmart I've seen people use
this for their own weave so I'm going to
try this one out I also got an elastic
band and this is a mini Weddle acid and
I usually use these for my dome cap
weaves a wig soap because it gives you
an extra I'm hold and it actually holds
a week together better and I got this
dome cap from Sally's and I always buy
these dumb caps they're very sturdy and
there's a huge thick band on the bottom
that supports the wig and it doesn't
slide off your head so I really like
this and in my bag they also sent me
this cute little car very professional
very official and it just says sunshine
here and it's a bad all the information
like and follow them on Facebook they
add all these other information cards in
the back which is really nice and they
also sent me these cute little lashes as
a gift which is really cute and they're
like really natural lashes but we all
know that I like dramatic lashes so I'll
probably use these on a neutral day if
so but the thought was very nice tussle
I appreciate this a lot and that's about
it i'm not going to keep you guys here
rambling so then you guys were stopping
