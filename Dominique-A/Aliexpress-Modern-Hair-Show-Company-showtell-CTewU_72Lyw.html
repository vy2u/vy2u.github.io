do a really quick video for a hair
review for a company that's based off
the I'll Express called modern hair so I
would sent four bundles of hair and a
closure and the texture is the Virgin
Peruvian body wave here I also got two
bundles of 24 inches two bundles of 26
inches and one 18 inch closure
it's been a long time since I've done a
video so I'm trying to get back into the
mix guys so please bear with me the
package scam DHL was a very fast
shipping it came in about three days she
sent it to me and she sent out to me on
Tuesday I got it on Friday and it was
through DHL this is what the packaging
look like with all the hair inside of it
I did pull the hair up but I didn't open
it well yeah I did open all the bundles
but I did pull the hair out but this is
what the package looks like when you
first get it in the met when you get it
out of this DHL bag and it's really nice
very professional you do get like a
little pamphlet and I'm not sure where
again with the pamphlet but it explains
to you everything on the website like
all the shipping and all the haircare
and products and stuff like that it's
listed on the pamphlet that they
actually give you went to hair so I
thought that was really really nice that
they did that but this is basically how
it comes very nicely packaged I
appreciate the extra effort and how they
put their logo right here on top of it
which makes it look really really
professional so into this we're gonna
get into the air I got like I said I got
to 24 inches in to 26 inches in 18-inch
closure these two bundles right here are
the 24 inch bundles and as you can tell
like I said guys it's a body a pattern
and for most of you guys that don't know
body wave is actually steam press to be
this pattern I'm pretty sure if you went
well for my experience when you wet this
hair it's not gonna come back to this
pattern because it's steam press to be
that pattern it's just some but the
thing you know what but the thing about
hair drying here that has a body wave
pattern on it when you do go in and try
to curl the hair it has a bit has better
volume and it holds a better curl I
noticed that better than buying straight
hair if you buy hair let's touch your
body wave when you go to curly hair it
holds a better curl
and it has a but it's more fuller and it
has nice bounce to it and I noticed that
about body wave here so that's a plus of
body wave here and like this is 24
inches it's very long
it reaches just about like the top of my
butt which is really nice to have that
long beyond say here because I am gonna
go see Beyonce at MetLife Stadium on the
11th so I'm really really excited about
that so I have to look good for B so
this is it it has no smell and I'll run
my fingers to it to show you guys
there's absolutely no shedding with this
hair so far so that's really good I like
to get a hair from a company that's
actually doesn't shed but like I said in
my previous do this before no matter
what all hair sheds real hair sheds here
off the real headshot so it's kind of
inevitable at this point so it's just
something just gonna have to deal with
so now these are the 12 26 inch windows
and the 26 inch bundles they could you
get less hair obviously just for the
simple fact that it is a longer length
and this I noticed that the wave
patterns on the 26 inches are a little
bit looser but like I said I'm not - I
don't really care too much about the way
patter I just care about the length
texture lustre and all that kind of
stuff
the lay the pattern doesn't really make
a difference for me it's fine but this
is what it looks like very nice like I
said I could bring my hands to it no
shedding whatsoever at this point um it
has like an awesome bounce you see that
guys and these bundles are true to
length as you can tell you got your 24
right here and your 26 right here and
when you stretch it is even longer so
the 26 inch to me will be considered
more than I got 28 inch or maybe a 30
inch but like I said I've never I mean
like I've never had 30 inch hair but
it's kind of it's really really long
I've had it 26 inch here before and I
kind of like this 26 inches a little bit
longer than what the normal 26 inch is
if I really knew what that was but yeah
so it's a little bit long and this is
what for Brenner's looks like so this
would be for butters in my head
I have a really dinky head so this might
be a lot this just on the side is a lot
of hair but I'm gonna try to get all
this on a dome cap because I'm gonna
make myself awake so I'm gonna hopefully
this turns out to be a very great thing
but I really like the texture and bounce
now lastly this is a closure I love how
the closure has that supportive band
around it so it's not it's not that type
of closure that's just gonna pop in the
red I like that because there's a little
bit of a barrier so it protects the
closure from getting um from ripping
apart like I said this is 18-inch and it
also has the same all the patterns
matched at all body wave this is free
parting so you can part it anywhere I
like that because I'm gonna go in and do
my get myself like a little middle part
and I'm gonna just stick with a middle
part no it's not looking too bad on me I
have a large forehead so it's kind of
like a hit or miss sometimes but I'm
gonna try to do a middle part with this
style too as well but the closure is
nice so well it's not it's there's not
bleach knots and I'm not gonna bleach
them cuz I try that one time and I
screwed it over one time oh my my
closure saw I don't have time for that
this time I'm just notebooks will
conceal the backburner right here and
then just put it on so we'll see how
that goes so so far so good guys I'm
really excited about this I haven't had
long hair in like weeks no I haven't had
long yeah I haven't had long hair and
weeks so it's something's gonna be
something exciting again to get back
into a long hair thing so I'm really
excited about that I will update you
guys on the hair once I have installed
the unit on my head also if you guys
have any questions about my hair that I
have it right now because I know a lot
of people on YouTube aren't I mean oh my
Instagram have been asking me what the
hell this is I am going to be doing a
video on a Kylie Jenner inspired look
because I am gonna die this hair a teal
color so I'm kind of just kind of like
what Kylie Jenner has so you'll see that
but this blonde was so much fun if
you're wondering I kind of blonde this
is it was platinum before and I turned
it into dark ash blonde so this is dark
Aswang right here for you
it's a really really nice pretty color I
was a little scared in the beginning
when I first put it on cuz it was kind
of like a powell color but I'm kind of
used to just not giving the anymore
so I just I don't care I just wore so I
will keep you guys posted so look
forward to that video for the car Jenner
inspire your style and also look for for
this video because I'm really excited
about this hair that's like we could do
a lot with it so thumbs up this video if
