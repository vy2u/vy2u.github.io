do a really quick video for a hair
review for a company that's based off
the Aliexpress called modern hair show I
would send four bundles of hearing a
closure and the texture is the virgin
peruvian body wave here i also got two
bundles of 24 inches two bundles of 26
inches and 1 18 inch closer it's been a
long time since i've done a video so i'm
trying to get back into the mix guys so
please bear with me the package came DHL
was a very fast shipping it came in
about three days she sent it to me and
she sent out to me on tuesday i got on
friday and it was through DHL this is
what the packaging look like with all
the hair inside of it i did pull the
hair out but i didn't open it what I did
open all the bundles but I did pull the
hair out but this is what the package
looks like when you first get it in the
minute when you get it out of the DHL
bag and its really nice very
professional you do get like a little
pamphlet and let your again with the
pamphlet but it explains to you
everything on the website like all the
shipping and all the hair care and
products and stuff like that it's listed
on the pamphlet that they actually give
you wet the hair so I thought that was
really really nice that they did that
but this is basically how it comes very
nicely packaged I appreciate the extra
effort and how they put their logo right
here on top of it which makes it look
really really professional so intimate
we're going to get into the hair I got
like I said I got to 24 inches into 26
inches in 18 inch closure these two
bundles right here are the 24 inch
bundles and as you can tell I guess so
guys it's a body a pattern and foremost
you guys I don't know body wave is
actually steam press to be this pattern
I'm pretty sure if you went well for my
experience when you wet this hair it's
not going to come back to this pattern
because it's steam press to be that
pattern it's just some but the thing you
know what but the thing about buying
here that has a body wave pattern on it
when you do go in and try to curl their
hair it has a bit has better volume and
it holds a better
girl i noticed that better than buying
straight here if you buy here that's
textured body wave when you go to curly
hair it holds a better curl and it has a
bit it's more fuller and it has nice
bounce to it and I notice that about
body wave here so that's a plus or body
wave hair and like this is 24 inches is
very long it reaches just about like the
top of my butt which is really nice to
have that long Beyonce here because I am
going to go see Beyonce at metlife
stadium on the 11th so I'm really really
excited about that so I have to look
good for be so this is it it has no
smell and I'll run my fingers to it to
show you guys there's absolutely no
shedding with his hair so far so that's
really good I like to get a hair from a
company that actually doesn't shed but
like I said in my previous do this
before no matter what all hair sheds
real hair sheds here off the real
headshot so it's kind of inevitable at
this point so it's just something it
just gonna have to deal with so now
these are the 12 26 inch windows and the
26 inch bundles they could you get less
hair obviously just spin simple fact
that it is a longer length and this I
noticed that the wave patterns on the 26
inches in a little bit looser but like I
said I'm not too i don't really care too
much about the wave pattern i just care
about the length texture luster and all
that kind of stuff the length of the
pattern doesn't really make a difference
for me it's fine but this is what it
looks like very nice like i said i can
bring my hands to it no shedding
whatsoever at this point um and it has
like an awesome bounce you see that
guy's and these bundles are true to
length as you can tell you got your 24
right here and you're 26 right here and
when you stretch it is even longer so
the 26 inch to me will be considered
more that got 28 inch or maybe a 30 inch
but like I said I've never I mean like
I've never had 30 inch hair it's kind of
it's really really long I've had hit 26
inch here before and I kind of like this
26 inches a little bit longer than what
the normal 26 inch is
if I really knew what that was but yeah
so it's a little bit long and this is
what four burners looks like so this
will be for butters in my head and I
have a really dinky head so this might
be a lot this just on the side is a lot
of hair but I'm going to try to get all
this on a dome cap because I'm going to
make myself away so I'm going to
hopefully this turns out to be a very
great thing but I really like the
texture and bounds now lastly this is a
closure I love how the closure has that
supportive band around it so it's not
it's not that type of closure that's
just going to pop in a rape I like that
because i was a little bit of a barrier
so it protects the closer from getting
from ripping apart like I said this is
18 inch and it also has the same all the
patterns matched at all body wave this
is free parting so you can part it
anywhere I like that because I'm going
to go in and do my get myself like a
little middle part I think imma just
stick with a middle part no it's not
looking too bad on me I have a large
forehead so it's kind of like a hit or
miss sometimes but I'm going to try to
do a middle part with the style to as
well but the closure is nice well it's
not it's there's not bleach knocks and
I'm not going to bleach them because I
try that one time and I screwed it over
one time on one of my clothes so I don't
have time for that this time under snow
boots will conceal the back burner right
here and then just put it on so we'll
see how that goes so so far so good guys
I'm really excited about this i haven't
had long hair and like weeks no i
haven't had long yeah haven't had long
hair and weeks so it's something's going
to be something exciting again to get
back into a long hair thing so I'm
really excited about that I will update
you guys on the hair once i have
installed the unit on my head also if
you guys have any questions about my
hair that i have it right now because I
know a lot of people on YouTube aren't I
mean on my Instagram have been asking me
what the hell this is I am going to be
doing a video on a kylie jenner inspired
look because i am going to die this hair
a teal color so I'm kind of just kind of
like what kylie jenner has so you'll see
that but this blonde was so much fun if
you
wonder what kind of blonde this is it
was platinum before and I turned it into
dark ass blonde so this is dark ass
blonde right here for you guys it's a
really really nice pretty color I was a
little scared in the beginning when I
first put it on because it was kind of
like a POW color but I'm kind of used to
just not giving the fuck anymore so i
just i don't care i just wore so i will
keep you guys posted so look forward to
that video for the kylie jenner inspire
your style and also look for for this
