to do a quick review on some hair i just
got today from Aliexpress com i ordered
this here think either monday night or
tuesday afternoon and the hair that i
ordered is from a company called new
star hair and it was very fast shipping
i think it said three to seven days but
i actually got into three days the
processing time was two days any
information that you need i will set up
with the direct link on the bottom of my
page on the bottom and i'll leave all
the descriptions on the bottom but i'm
going to just show you guys what the
hair looks like and this is how the
package came in it came in at DHL
package just a regular old bag that they
usually send you in the package and it
just put this put um what comrade
address i just put it in the package
like this and evan information in the
box and then like that this company is
very good shipping i saw two reviews on
youtube on this type of hair from new
hair from Aliexpress um i am getting the
hair installed today so that's Brad my
head on just wash my hair and kind of
getting ready to do my hair so i'll show
you i ordered four bundles of here i
order 14-inch 20-inch 22 and 24 inch and
he sent a bag bit here and like these
large plastic bags whenever he took
already opened the bag I just wanted to
feel the hair and I got excited so he
sent two packs two bundles and one bag
so this is 14 inches this is 20 inches
and obviously you wanting to get this
confused to do be in the shower
take it off the bag and you can tell
which one is which this is a 14-inch
bundle right hair it's very short see
that I can demonstrate against bullying
and this is a 20 inch one um my first
start of the hair I ran my hands through
the hair and they're still shouting
that's one good thing and this is a
14-inch pack right here and you know the
shorter the length the more here you get
in the bundle so this is like a lot of
hair and this is a 20 inch it's not that
much but it's still a good amount from
there I'm actually not going to use a
14-inch so I'm giving it to my sister so
she could do some clippings but I'm
going to use the 20 inch 22 inch 24 inch
and also have a closures that I want to
show you guys that I had from in a
previous video that i read you I'm going
to reuse again I watched it and I did a
method with that closer so I don't have
to you know put glue on it but this is a
20 inch closer right here it's a good
amount of hair and this is the twin the
4 to 6 14 inch goes 14 I'm sorry and
it's all good here very nice texture
nice waves and like I said no tangling
and no shedding a pup I think it to the
one hair strand so this is the first
pack and this right here is the second
pack and this is like extremely low like
I have a 22 inch and I believe this is a
22 inch right here you can pull it down
and see the difference this is a 24
right here and this is a 22 and like I
said with this hair there is absolutely
no shedding either i didn't get one hair
strand not even one and it's like really
pretty waves I love the ways this is not
really like a smell smells like any type
of here you would take usually start
from the hair from the beauty supply
store is just the same way these are
kind of small to like I said the law
girly hair the shorter the thumb out of
here you get you don't get that much
hair but this I actually want to do all
three bundles of 20 inch 22 and 24 inch
in my head so um I'm hoping that this
good fit and i only pay for all four
bundles i paid 185 something up with the
to stop with the price anything down
there and it was with free shipping too
so for that kind of price is pretty good
but we won't know if it's really good
I finished happening in for about two
weeks to tell you guys really what it's
like but that's why this is really good
I love it the balance like I said okay
well I got one strand right here don't
you see that as a lighting one strand of
hair but that's okay and I'm expecting
to do it like this so um that's far i'm
very happy i put all the price and
everything I told you guys I got 14 inch
20 and 22 months and 24 inches so for
that price it's a pretty good deal and
I've ordered from Aliexpress before I've
never had a problem with aliexpress.com
so that's that so what I'm going to do
is just get a regular sewing weave and
I'm going to use my closure and this is
the closure that i'm using can this
closure is from heavily if a heavily
hair com i got this like months ago like
much month supply just i still have it
because i still take care of it I washed
it and it still has like the same body
wave well the hair is body we've done in
order and it still has the same body
wave and say hair that i ordered so
that's a good thing but what i did this
time was iphone i saw a couple YouTube
videos of people attaching like elastic
band to their weave so that when you put
the hair on it just sits flat instead of
gluing the gluing the closure and this
is a silk base closure store it looks
pretty much natural as you guys can see
I put a little makeup right here so far
looks bad crusty coming but it's a soap
base closure you can see with the light
that looks pretty much realistic I
plucked a couple years in the front too
but this is what i did i lie soudan some
bands on the side right here so that it
could be really tight and it could fit
but i am going to sew this back piece to
the back of my braids just to keep it
down um and then get the rest of my hair
so I know about all the hair bundles in
and this closer i think i paid a hundred
and forty-nine dollars for this and I
kind of feel dumb because I couldn't
want to express that common gone for
like sixty two blocks burn whatever it
had been real cheap it was originally 16
inches but I cut layers into it because
i usually do a middle part with this
here but since i'm not doing it apart
I'm doing a side part but the thing
about this having closure you could
switch it since i'm not going it done i
can switch it either way that I want it
to be so that's a good part about it and
like i said i saw these down right here
and then I just put the elastic day and
this is one that I use from another way
that I had a dome cap and I use a dump
cap and I cut it apart and used it
because I don't feel like going out to
buy another one and this much the hair
touch the hair colors like a natural
brown and this is a natural brown
looking color to natural dark brown
black brown whatever and it actually
goes with the hair because it's virgin
hair so it all just mixes in together so
that's about it Oh being sullen hair
like shortly and I will leave um I will
do another video after the hairs install
I'm either going to do a side part or
middle part and after the hair is
installed I will come back and do a
video and show you guys the final
results of the hair and I will update
you guys on the CF because I know I
don't do update videos but this probably
the first time going to an update video
so stay tuned guys thank you for
stopping by and any questions the
comments that you have you be more than
happy to leave it down below and wish me
luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
