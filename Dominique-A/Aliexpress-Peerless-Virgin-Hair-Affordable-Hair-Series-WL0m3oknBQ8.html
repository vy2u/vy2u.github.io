today is gonna be more of like a
different thing so this will be an intro
to a series that I'm gonna start on my
channel which is just an affordable hair
series and I'm gonna be purchasing here
and doing some reviews for some hair
companies for some very affordable hair
and most of the hair companies I'm gonna
be doing reviews from our base off the
bat Express because as you guys know
from all my last videos I do shop what
I'll Express a lot for hair just because
I'll Express has very good affordable
hair and it's a really good price so I
thought that for all you ladies out
there who really do like shopping at
Aliexpress aren't even eBay cuz I know
eBay used to be a thing way back then
but mostly Aliexpress girls of you guys
are the ones I like to shop on
Aliexpress and really like to buy it
like really good hair I'm gonna start a
series on my channel that's just
affordable hair series so today I'm
gonna start for the company that I've
seen a thousand people doing on
Aliexpress this company contacted me and
wanted me to do this hair review and
this hair reviews for a company of
Express called peerless hair and they
sent me three bundles of hair in a
closure the hair that I got is a virgin
Peruvian body wave hair and I got links
and the hair lengths are 22 inches 24
and 26 I did go for longer lengths to
sign because I do want to do kind of a
nice sleek sexy style kind of hair look
I don't know what I was thinking if you
got so many haircolor ideas or ideas
that you just want me to do for this
hair just leave your comments down below
because I'm kind of like I'm sure what
I'm gonna do with this hair yet so it
would be nice if you guys can give me
your suggestions down below so I also
got a closure and I'm an effort I think
I actually forgot what blank clothes I
got but I'm gonna do a guesstimation
right now I think this closure is about
fourteen or sixteen inch and we'll just
go with sixteen inch because that
probably sounds like something that I
would get so yeah so I'll just show you
that so the closure looks like I already
pulls it out the back it came to DHL and
like I said I was sent this here for
review so I'm gonna be honest about it
I'm not gonna lie for the company or
anything like that if you want to check
out more hair reviews you can just look
at all the other women out here who've
done reviews for this hair company so
like I said I think this is 16 inch
closure that I got and it's Peruvian
virgin body wave hair and it is very
nice I'm not getting any snag
anything that I think that I like one
little baby strand but whatever it does
have baby hairs in the front I just got
a free part and the only thing I notice
about the closure is kind of thick but
I'm usually able to manipulate this type
of stuff so I'm hoping that I can
manipulate this Elise but it's really
nice in you guys can see the texture is
really pretty on this and I don't see
any gray hairs on your either and it
does it has kind of like a plastic smile
you know when you get here from exercise
that kind of like plasticy smell this
has a plastic smell so yeah but it looks
really nice and it does have a
supportive band around the perimeter so
therefore you're not gonna get any
tearing from this so that's a good thing
so I'll just show you guys with the
bundles look like I'm going to start
with the 22 inch bundle and I'm not
gonna lie guys the hair is absolutely
full and it is absolutely soft so this
is a 22 inch bundle no shedding
whatsoever people like I'm not even
joking right now this hair is really
really really soft and it's really
really nice I don't know um and I just I
think I said this about here all the
time but like when I open this I was
kind of blown away because it's really
really nice hair so this is a 24 inch
bundle a 22 inch sorry guys it's very
full and the ends are very very full it
does kind of a little bit of a stinky
smell but whatever I'm gonna wash it and
then I'm gonna I'm gonna treat it and
then we're gonna see we're gonna do but
like I said I want you guys to give me
some ideas of what you guys want me to
do with this hair so as you guys leave
your comments down below so I know what
I'm gonna do like if I'm gonna color it
or I'm gonna leave a black natural so
then I can spawn I'll show you guys is a
24 inch and like I said guys a beautiful
pattern full absolutely no shedding and
I'm running my hands directly through
this hair there's absolutely no shedding
I hope you guys can see how beautiful
this says that it's great yeah it's
pretty pretty pretty pretty and really
nice I don't think I think maybe I feel
like one grace speck right here but you
guys will see that but it's really
really nice and like I said just have
that kind of like a little bit of a funk
to fight smell so I don't know what that
is we're gonna wash that out and this is
a 26 inch pan I did
along and I didn't show you guys but
I'll show you guys with the bundles
sighs looks like so this is the 26 inch
and guys it is absolutely full all the
way through 26 inches should come right
down it's actually if you're sitting
like this I'm five five so this actually
sits on my thighs so it's pretty long
and this is really pretty guys look at
this look at how beautiful this hair is
look at the texture it's really soft and
I'll show you guys what each one that
looks like and if I corresponding to the
might of hair that comes in it so this
is amount of hair I'm crossing my
fingers that this is enough hair but I
have like hair stashes on deck at my
house so I'm pretty sure I can put some
scraps in there if I have to but this is
all the hair that you get this is the 22
inch 24 inch and 26 inch bundle and it
comes pretty full with the closure I'm
convinced that I'll be able to make a
full wig with this and it'll still be
full because if you guys could tell this
is almost as this is like a ponytail
size right here so this is enough hair
and the closure will be just to seal the
top of my head so yeah this is good
money right here guys if you want to
check out their company I leave all the
information down below actually the
direct link for this hair hair like I
said you guys just with the Peruvian
body wave hair I got links 22 24 and 26
and a 16 inch closer if you feel more
comfortable getting four bundles and you
do you but I got this separate review so
I just chose three bundles I don't know
whatever but yeah so to me first
impression on this hair it looks really
good I'm actually pretty excited I'm
tempted to color the hair I don't know
I've been obsessing with colors so I'm
very interested to color this hair but
before I call that I want you guys to
leave your comments down below and tell
me what you think I should do I will
post a video next week with the hair
install so then we will see what the
grand reveal looks like I don't know if
I want to do like a red ombre or if I
should just do my regular blonde ombre
with like tow ash tones in it because I
really like that for the spring and
summer but leave your comments down
below and tell me what you think
also guys thumbs up this video guys if
you guys like it and also subscribe if
you haven't I will be talking update on
that grant ombre hairstyle that I had in
my previous video because you guys love
