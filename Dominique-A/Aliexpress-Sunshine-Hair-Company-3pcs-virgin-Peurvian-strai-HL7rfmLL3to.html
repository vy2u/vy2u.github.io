was stopping by today to do this update
review for the hair company called
sunshine hair company based on
Aliexpress and if you watch my class my
second to last previous video I did the
initial show-and-tell of the hair and
I've been wearing the hair for about a
month and I decided to come and tell you
guys what I like about the hair when I
don't like about the hair I am still
currently rotating the wig right now I
made into wave and I basically wanted to
give my the long hair break so I did
this kind of a 27-piece style just for
now but I still have that hair on the
shelf so I'm really gonna put that hair
back on for April um so that's gonna
come back but I'll show you guys what
the hair looks like still the hair is
like this I did add a closure on to it
and if you watched my last video I did
tell you guys that's gonna do a Chinese
bang but I did end up doing the Chinese
bang for about like a week or so and
then um I don't know something came over
me and I decided to take the Chinese
bang off and just do my basic closure
with the middle or side part so I ended
up doing that like I always do which was
stupid because the Chinese bang honestly
was really really nice and I will insert
a pic for you guys to see exactly what
it looked like so nice and I regret that
I did it because the way I made the wig
it was impossible for me to go back and
add that Chinese bang again to make it
look exactly the way - the first time so
that was some lesson learned but next
time I will do a video and I will show
you guys exactly what it will look like
well do a video on some other hair and
I'm gonna make a way with the Chinese
bang because it was really really nice
guys but um I settled for the regular
part but I added the closure and I did
buy the closure op from the beauty
supply store it was kind of like a last
minute run so I went there and got the
closure and then decided to insert it on
the way so you can see the hair is very
long
the hair is 26 inches 24 inches 22 and
18 and the closure is actually a 16 inch
closure so it all goes together pretty
well I will show you guys how I made it
I'm pretty sure you guys seen videos on
YouTube like crazy people show you guys
is that how they make a weight on a dome
cap of the closure so mine is just
basically simple I got the dome cap from
Sally's and then I sewed it on the dome
cap
I don't really mention on my head
because a lady's elastic band an elastic
band actually makes it tight so it kind
of lays the closure down the elastic
band I got it from Walmart and it was a
nice size black and then I put the
closure right here and I sewed around
the closure to hold it down and I sold
the elastic band actually on the sides
to hold the closure and the cap itself
so it's very sturdy and it fits really
really well and I sold all the hair on I
had no problem getting all the hair on
the way and none of the tracks even came
out everything is very stern well
everything is very reinforced so it's
really good like I told you guys I did
Tom you spray block Freight check on my
on my left so I didn't really I don't
really get shedding at all the hair
doesn't really shed when I styled it
here I don't really get shedding if I
comb any instrument maybe I'll get like
a couple strands but nothing major I'm
not having here I'm not seeing here on
my bathroom floor it's very very minimal
shedding which I like because I don't
like hair that shuts too much at the
same time all hair shed so that's
something you have to understand when
you're buying hair virgin hair given
here any type hair
synthetic can eyeball hair shed so
therefore it's just something you're
gonna have to deal with anyways but
that's far I like this a lot and like I
said I plan just to leave this one this
color I'm do I'm not planning on doing
any major colors to it or anything like
that I want to keep this one simple but
like I said I will be doing two more
different wigs I want to do like a wig
with highlights I want to try highlights
and I also want to do it wig just a
plain old natural colorway with Chinese
bang and I once her picks up what I've
done to this hairstyle day I've done
absolutely everything with this wig my
crimson curl did straightened it Chinese
banged it everything I really like this
and like I said when I get here I
usually try to do everything with the
hair when I watched in here I just deep
conditioned it wasn't Tresemme deep
conditioner
I don't use any products on it maybe if
I want to straighten hair I'll use a
heat protectant spray I don't put oil on
it or grease or any of that crazy stuff
I leave the hair in its natural state it
has a very nice flow to it guys as you
guys can tell it's not stiff it's really
pretty shaking all that and it still has
a little bit of a dip it away from some
old curls that I had in the air so it
held up pretty well I mean like I said
this is not the end for this wig this
wig will actually be featured in several
more videos guys because you guys know
I'm not throwing this out I'm not
getting rid of this and like my been
like the lol boutique hair that I had in
my other video the one with the blonde
at the bottom I still have that wig as
well and then just save them for a day I
want to feel like I want to be somebody
else that day if I want to look like
something different that day I could
just pop one of these on and like I said
I'm just transitioning right now from
shorting hair to long hair well long
hair to short hair just because I wanted
to try something fun and cool something
easy I did make this until wig so I
could just pop this one off at night and
I could like you know take really good
care of my real hair while I'm just you
know just take really good care of my
hair through wigs and weaves and stuff
like that so it's pretty good and this
is just like on a regular stocking cap
and it just doubles it up and use some
shower cap methods so this is very
simple when I'm making like a wig with a
closure or with like long hair I usually
just saw it on a dome cap because it's
easier but this is kind of like a
quickly very simple like I said I got
the closure for that way from the beauty
supply store and it's a Janet collection
way table closure and it's Brazilian
natural hair this was actually really
good you can dye this hair you can do
absolutely anything with this hair
islands all the informations right here
they also have this cool thing inside
when they tell you all that stuff you
know so I paid about 70 bucks for this
closure and like I said it was like a
last minute purchase because I really
needed something so I just bought it and
it's actually pretty good I don't get
shedding on the closure the closure
straightens getting curls very well and
though I mean I feel like it's
realistic-looking enough I did put a
little bit of concealer too you know
make it look extra pretty and that's it
so I'm going to insert pictures you guys
can see and that's about it guys I'm on
a scale of one to ten I would write that
here have like a nine other than that
that's about it the hair is really good
I like it
and that's about it guys so thank you
