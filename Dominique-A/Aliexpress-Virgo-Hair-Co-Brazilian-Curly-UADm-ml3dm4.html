going this is the first video of the new
year that I'm creating and I'm back to
my hair reviews again so as you can tell
I'm wearing this big curly hair and this
hair was sent to me by a company offer
Aliexpress none other and this hair is
from a company called Virgo hair company
and I see so I watched a couple videos
from other ladies on YouTube who review
this hair as well the guiness
necessarily review this texture here but
they review their body wave or their
straight hair and I seen great qualities
of the hair itself so I was like okay
I'm into the review for you guys so this
is the verge of Brazilian curly hair and
I got to 26 inch bundles 124 122 and an
18-inch closure as you guys already know
I never do so ins because I don't have
hair right now I have a pixie cut so the
only thing I do is make units and this
is a unit and I did use all four bundles
in the closure surprisingly and it
really off it and this is what the hair
this is how big the hair is the hair is
very dense guys but what I want to say
about it being dense is that it's dense
with purpose like the curls are really
really nice and it looks very very like
kinky and natural looking of course it's
not my hair because everyone knows that
my hair is short but if you want to if
you want to get some curly hair that
kind of resembles it's kind of like a
really nice African American texture or
feel or look this supposed to be really
good here for that because the hair is
not like one of those kind of like soft
curly looks this is like a really
defined curl and it looks really really
nice and it has its nice kind of
textured look which I really like I do
not diffuse the hair I don't use any
heat products with this hair when I'm
kind of like detangling it or trying to
pop the curls the only thing that I do
is co wash it out with a wide tooth comb
I make sure I get all the kinks out of
it I do use two products I use this
product from TJ Maxx and it's called the
argon Magic intense hair oil and it's
just basically one of your argon oils
it's very simple I just used a little
bit of it in my hand I try to move it
through the hair a lot the other thing
that I use is from Walmart and I know
people know about this product this is
the Cantu shea butter leave-in
conditioner came for natural hair
natural hair curly hair same
so I use this it's kind of like a creamy
custard like basically a white formula
it's very light and it's um I usually
mix this with water I wait I make sure
that the hair is wet first before I mix
this in because it is kind of thick I
just put this through the sections and
make sure I comb with you with the comb
and it actually leaves the curls very
defined like I said because I wear units
I usually do this on the on the
mannequin hands and I hang it up so I
can air dry and this is what the hair
looks like after I've let it air dry
these are the curls guys like this is so
pretty and this is how long the hair is
I might have clipped like a little bit
of the ends off just because it was
excessive but this is what the hair
looks like guys you can see how
beautiful that's gonna culture looks
like this is a closure right here the
closure is like regular size closure I
did kind of like try to do some baby
hairs by myself just because I was it
was like too like weird looking so I do
what I could to make it look nice well
like I said I did put all the bundles in
my hair if you're if you like big hair
and your want something that has a lot
of elevation this is gonna be the hair
for you I don't really have a long curl
unit that looks like this or a long
curly kinky unit so I decided to get
this hair just to try a different style
for you guys leave your comments down
below if you guys like this hair so far
I really do like it and I will post a
video showing you guys how I detangle it
and how I'm style the hair so that you
guys can see if you guys buy this here
what you guys need to do with it to
maintain its beautiful curls so I hope
you guys thought that this video was
kind of informative I don't really want
to make long hair review videos because
it's unnecessary and I should just get
straight to the point this year so I
hope you guys really liked this video
and I hope you guys like this hair so
far I really do like it I've had it for
about three weeks so it is actually
doing the best that it can do so far so
make sure you leave all your comments
down below make sure you thumbs up this
video and subscribe if you have it and I
will catch you guys later bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
