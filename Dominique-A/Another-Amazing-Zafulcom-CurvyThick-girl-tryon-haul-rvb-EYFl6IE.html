with another Kirby slash thick girl
trying haul video so in today's video
guys I'll be showing you guys some
clothes from zap fool.com so today it's
gonna be a fun video I did get stuff a
lot of items that I selected and then it
kind of randomly threw in random things
I didn't even choose so what I'm
probably gonna do is do a giveaway with
the clothes so I'm gonna kind of combine
a lot of the items that I've gotten from
companies I did it where and give it to
you guys now these clothes are fresh not
worn no smell no stains nothing so I'm
gonna try to do a giveaway and try to do
a giveaway with more than one winner so
a lot of other a lot of people get the
opportunity to actually win something so
I will announce the giveaway actually
next fashion Friday for you guys because
I want to kind of formulate the plan but
I am gonna do a giveaway for that and I
do have some wig giveaways as well so if
you stay tuned and keep watching my
videos you guys will hear all about it
so I'm gonna tell the regular trying to
haul as usual guys show you guys what I
got hope you guys are enjoying my
fashion Friday videos my wig Wednesday
videos I do have a plan formulating in
my head about a transformation Tuesday
video and basically what I'm trying to
do is because now I'm adding extra wig
videos in the week so I wanted to kind
of do a transformation Tuesdays by
showing you guys how extensions and wigs
look on my friends and family members
because you guys do say a lot that you
guys are afraid to buy the unit because
it's not gonna look the same on me as it
looks on you so I want to show you guys
what things look like on my friends and
family so that you guys get a better
perspective and that you guys are more
confident when it comes to purchasing
these wigs from these companies so tell
me what you think about that idea makes
you leave your comment down below and as
far as this try at all guys I would like
you to stay tuned and keep up so guys
what I'm gonna start off with first is a
jewelry that I got so I kind of went a
little I didn't gold jewelry crazy I was
just trying to pick up some jewelry
pieces that were kind of cool and I
loved necklaces and this necklace that
I'm wearing right now is from my name
necklace calm it's not sponsored for
this haul or anything like that I'm just
mentioning that they have great name
plates and stuff like that so I'll link
that down below for you guys so I like
necklaces I like kind of like cool
little things just to kind of jazz your
look up so the first thing I'm going to
show you guys is this cute
earpiece that I got now this is kind of
like a diamond-studded
earpiece it kind of fits my ear but my
ears a little bit small salt is this
small I don't know but it kind of fits
and it doesn't fit so I kind of attached
it on there because I was going for it
looks really cool you have your hair
like to flip I'm tucked behind and then
you have this showing so I just put that
on and I thought it was cute I saw on
the website I didn't expect it to be
this big but what are you gonna do I
can't break it to make it smaller I
actually can but there's nothing I could
do about it
that's far so I'm just gonna keep it I
like it it gives my look a little bit
more of a flare and it draws emphasis to
this area which I like highlight poppin
ear popping baby hair popping you know
what I mean
so I thought that was cute and I think
it was like two dollars on the website
or a dollar their jewelry is actually
really cheap but I believe with these
asian face companies they create the
jewelry anyway so I don't really think
it costs that much to make it to be
completely honest so that's how you know
I'm getting real comfortable for this
haul cuz I got my whole entire big old
thigh up on here
arresting myself up so I'm kind of
sitting on my little kind of like sexy
couch it's what I call it cuz I'm kind
of I know I cuz I change the background
so I'm kind of backwards against the
wall so I got my big old guy Meetup and
stuff like that but I feel comfortable
this way so the next thing I'm gonna
show you guys are these really cute
earrings now I'm gonna show this up on
the side screen just because it'll
really wash me out so basically this
yellow is a really nice dangly kind of
cloth earring now the cloth earrings are
very popular right now and it's like
really trending and more so back to
color cloth earrings so I wanted to get
red ones but I ended up getting the
yellow ones just because I wanted to
have like a pop of color for the Fall so
I thought that things are really cute it
does have like a nice little design like
a floral design and then you get like
the three branch off of like a little
yarn fabric or whatever I think that
these are really cute guys and I thought
it would be cute to style my hair and
like a ponytail or a bun or even like
this would be cute if I had those
earrings on so I wanted to get these
earrings so bad and I got them from here
now these are price about like two
dollars or a dollar which is inexpensive
AF so if you're looking for some cute
cloth earrings I highly recommend going
to Zac pool or you know just it's just
really cheap and
I don't know it's really nice and I
believe they're sturdy enough if they
break I'll let y'all know so the next
thing I got is this really cute triple
tray triple chain so basically it's
really cute guys it's gold I love gold
jewelry now this one has like a half
moon a horseshoe instead of horse I
don't even know
horseshoe a leaf it's kind of one of
those triple chain situations where you
kind of have like a big chain here
middle chain and a long chain I really
like the layered chain look I think it
just gives the off it more of an edge so
when I picked this out with thinking
about you know kind of laying my
necklace up when I order my name plates
I usually get them in the child size
because I like them to choke me up right
here so if I were to add this set on top
of this one I was kind of have one right
here one right here and then one right
here and we'll just kind of give it more
of my neck area more of like a cool
illusion or you know what I'm saying
that layered look just really really
carries a vibe that I like so that's why
I pick out stuff like that I know that
sounds corny but if you know what I'm
talking about then you know what I'm
talking about so I thought that that was
really really cute
now the next other thing that I got
which is really random so I selected
this watch and I selected the watch and
gold and I only selected one so they
went and it sent me two of them they
sent me a rose gold and actual gold one
so what I'm gonna do is give this rose
gold went away to someone now I really
like this it's a very very simple watch
guys
now I'm not the type of person to go out
and spend like let's see I'm not the
type of person to guard and spin a mitt
like at least like fifty bucks on a
watch because I just feel like it's
unnecessary you're only using the watch
to know the time and it's not most of
the time I use my phone so it's kind of
like an accessory of fashion accessory
clearly so I don't feel like I need to
have a expensive watch I think that this
is really cute does have a sturdy band
the band is kind of like it's kind of
like one of those magnetic fake bands I
don't know explaining to you guys but
you guys will see whoever wins you'll
get it you'll see what I'm talking about
but I thought it was cute I don't even
know how to work the timer I don't know
if it does even even if it even works or
if it's just there for looks but
whatever I would only use this watch or
fashion statement I wouldn't use it like
a daily watch like no so I thought it
was cute for the purpose and I think it
was like three or five bucks now the
other the night
thing I got is this really simple
necklace I left choker style necklaces
sometimes I just feel like especially
because I like this nice rule right here
and I think the choker style necklace
when it sits on that nice little roll I
think it just gives me like a vibe and
I've been feeling vibes lately Oh like
vibes so I don't know I just like these
children style necklaces this one's very
simple and has like a little design in
the in the in the middle part and then
it just like really chokes you up so it
does have adjustable areas in the back
where you can adjust it to make it
tighter or looser so you have the option
to wear it like a regular necklace like
this or kind of choke yourself out Wow
choke yourself up Wow way to user words
so I thought that it looks cute guys and
like I said that was something barely 2
dollars so you can't really go around
moving along so the next thing I'm gonna
show you guys is this cute little fedora
hat that I picked out now they had it in
brown but I wanted a black one I have a
lot of black ones but my black ones
aren't as sturdy as this one is this
one's a little bit more sturdy and
strong meaning like it has like the
shape to it so I wanted to get one of
these I love it for actually wow maybe
it's not looking at the best right now
with this hair maybe with some straight
hair be like really popping but I liked
it I don't want to crash my hair down I
thought it was cute something to kind of
wear with like cute fall outfits boots
stuff like that so I just picked this
one out and I think this was like $10 or
like not even $10 I think this was like
6 bucks or 5 bucks in the range between
5 and 10 was the price and I thought
that was a really good price for this
just because it's sturdy it's nice it's
big head friendly and it definitely
would look really good with like nice
fall outfits like ah how about this fall
frenzy I just like everything fall and
this is definitely fall essential right
here oh yeah I'm embarrassing so the
next thing I'm gonna show you guys is
this cute little bag now you guys know
I'm not really like a purse carry where
I'm carrying the purse on my arm like
that it's like oh my god I need to find
my car in the parking lot like I'm not
that type of person so this this to me
crossbody bags like really cool style
crossbody bags are what I like and I
know that sounds corny I usually wear
like the same crossbody bag all the time
it's you could either be like a really
nice small plain one are wear like a
nice
like colourful one so I decided to
select this one now it's a tan color and
it does have a really really pretty
colorful strap now I like this a lot
because the two tassels on the front are
very plain a pink and blue and then you
get like this fun crazy crazy colored
strap now I know you guys probably oh my
god she's so corny for that yeah I am
and I've already admitted that I was I
love stuff like this it has a nice small
zip in the inside doesn't have a wallet
or anything like that
it's like perfect for just your lipgloss
setting spray maybe your powder and a
brush and then your cards and stuff like
that and that's it you really don't we
need to put that much stuff in a bag
when I have big bags like carry big bags
that I have a lot of space my bag tends
to be dirty it tends to have like
unnecessary items in there and it tends
to be extremely heavy so me having these
bags kind of minimizes my item list so I
just go out with like minimal stuff in
there and I just like the color I like
the style like the design it's very
minimalist but not really just because
it has a color and it has the spunk but
if you know me and you've been watching
me for awhile I say this all the time
I'm the corniest person on earth I love
these corny bags I think that is just
it's just simple but cute and your easy
ways for you to jazz it up so this is
definitely one of my favorites from this
channel I love it so much when I saw it
on the website I was like I have to have
this the next thing that it selected
guys is a scarf not only picked one
scarf from this website just because I
didn't like the other stars because they
had more so of like this kind of
polyester kind of really shiny shimmery
type of feel so this one looked like it
was gonna be a nice cottony comfortable
kind of warm feel so I picked this one
out and I was right so this one it's
kind of like a blue it's kind of like a
grey blue and white and red in the
middle accent it's very simple it is a
bit it's not long it's kind of like a
short style um
scarf but I thought it was really cute
and let me just put this on so you guys
see so I'm probably just gonna wrap it
like this and just woo oh yeah you got
you got to fix a curl up right mm-hmm
that way we
come down haha so I thought that this
was really cute guys so I picked this
one not and it's one it's really soft
which is one thing that I really liked
about it super super soft it does have
like a nice color design which I really
liked and I thought that it would be
nice to wear it doesn't necessarily have
to match every single outfit you have
but because the colors are kind of like
a neutral base color it kind of will go
with everything so I thought that this
was cute and it definitely can be one of
your fall scarves and I have a little
collection building up so your girls
really slowly preparing for this winter
weather so I thought that this was cute
so I picked this out and this was like
price range from about like five to ten
as well so definitely is definitely
affordable so the part that you guys
probably have been waiting for I've been
doing all this yep and so let's get
straight to the clothing part so this is
the first item that I got now this is a
random item that I did not select it's
not really my style but I tried it on I
was like okay it's not too bad not bad
at all so this is a two-piece that they
sent me now they sent me this in a size
you know I don't even know if it has a
size on it they sent me this in a size
and size make believe because they
didn't have a size so it's basically
like this kind of skirt like a kind of
like half a high-low skirt and it comes
with the crop top matching crop top now
the one thing I didn't like about this
it has like more solve a polyester feel
so it's kind of like a cheap costume
feel but when you put the outfit
together it's actually not as bad as I
thought but for something for some
reason when I see that polyester
material I kind of get like like real
like grossed out cuz I just feel like it
should be like a little bit cotton mix
of polyester so they should have at
least did a better job on the material
but it's cute I would probably wear this
if I was going on vacation or something
like that I wouldn't wear this like on
regular day walking down walking in
Connecticut like I just wouldn't cause
it's just too a little too tacky for me
but I thought it was cute if you like
pieces like this and I definitely need
to slim down a little for this so I
would definitely kind of not wear this
in the vicinity of where I live I
probably wear this if I'm going to an
island if I'm going on a trip or
something and want to just be a little
bit extra so yeah but you know it has
its little things it's a little crop top
little you know
that crop top it's cute the concept and
ideas q i wish to executed it better and
I didn't even select this so it's kind
of like a alright Dom so whatever so the
next thing I got I didn't even try this
on so this one is going to go away as a
giveaway immediately when I saw it I was
like there's no way my my boobs are
going to work when this one the way that
they this is like one of those clear
body suits now this body suit has like
the floral print on it
now the put the spot where the actual
flowers are landing where on God's green
earth is that gonna cover my my boobs my
areola anything it's just not gonna work
and I hope this video doesn't get flat
because YouTube's been acting real crazy
lately before me just saying Ariel I
hope that doesn't really flag me up on
but I just didn't like this guy's and I
just even an issue and I gotta I was
like first of all I didn't choose this
so why why why why why why why why so
I'm definitely to give this away to
someone because it's just not gonna work
so we can add this on the list it's cute
for someone was probably like flattered
in the chest
slimmer in the body more physique II
like buff I mean no but it does have a
lot of these floral prints on it it's
pretty nice pretty decent so if you're
into stuff like that and you want this
let me know so I'm giving this away guys
so they'll be added to the list of
giveaway items so yay so the next thing
I'm gonna show you guys that this really
cute dress now I didn't have someone to
help me zip this up so I kind of had to
like put my hair to the back so you guys
couldn't see the unzip portion but I
really really like this and I guess
crushed velvet is back in trend again
because they sent me a lot of crushed
velvet items that I didn't select but
I'm happy that they sent them to me
because I really really like these items
so this dress right here is kind of like
a nice plunge lined kind of like tank
top spaghetti-strap dress now this one
is in the size 2x now it's a 2x dog but
like I feel like the 2x it's kind of
small like I know I have like a set in
the back and have like a little set in
the front like meeting my boobs in my
butt but this that's not a 2x there's
just no way that's a 2x it was really
tight and
there's like a sway in the back and I
kind of almost felt like if I would've
did one little bend over my little
cheeks would have been like how long so
mm-hmm
I don't know man but I'm cubby Bo and
I'm gonna wear it and that bit looks
really good on the boob area I thought
that this was really nice the blue color
uh just against the skin and then that
long hair I just thought it was really
cute so I definitely will wear this
probably to a holiday party but what I
would do with this one Patel holiday
party I'm definitely have to put a
duster over and not take the duster off
at all because it will expose too much
just a nice dust or maybe like a tan
duster or a black duster we'll go over
it and you know kind of minimize the
breast egde but breasted but I thought
it was really cute guys it's a nice
crushed velvet and I just something
about apples just like oh my god this is
so cute so the next thing I got is
another crushed velvet now this is the
same exact color I didn't ask for this
one either it's a screen tea but I liked
it because of the the style the color
and the way they the design so I
basically set forever hungry and this is
in a size 2x as well so this would fit
properly and I like this one a lot it's
basically like a crushed velvety kind of
like a high collar kind of short
turtleneck I thought it was cute saying
forever hungry because I am forever
hungry if you know me I'm greedy my
boyfriend knows it like I've have an
attitude he knows like let me go get BAE
something to eat because she's about to
be real Aggie
that's how I am like I'm greedy there's
no there's no reason why I'm not this
way yeah you know I'm greedy I like to
eat I like food food makes me happy and
food fuels me and keeps me going
throughout the day so this shirt
definitely basically told my story only
one two sentences two words that's your
sentence two words so yeah I thought
this was cute it's a cute little simple
thing you're trying to make have like a
little cute outfit you don't have to put
too much effort in this it's already
kind of like a lot then just simplify it
up by adding some blue some blue jeans
black jeans and like some flats or
something very simple and you know it's
funny I'm saying flats you guys know I
really don't wear flats like that the
only flat said I ever wear are the mules
the ones that you slip on with like a
little bit of design I don't wear
closed-toe flats I just I just don't
like the way it looks on me it kind of
makes me look stubby I don't know if
that sounds crazy you guys know my girl
shut up but I just don't wear flats I
really relax I'm serious the only shows
that were like Birkenstock the slip-ons
or were like moccasin flats and mules so
I know that's weird and I just realized
that
hmm so the next thing I'm gonna be
giving away guys is this yellow leather
jacket now if you watch like the the
beginning first fall trying to haul that
I did and I forgot which cut it was like
a mixed round I was like a bunch of
companies so that first trial I did they
picked out a yellow jacket like this - a
yellow leather jacket
I did not pick this one this time
because why would I pick the same thing
that I had before but I guess Apple
didn't know and they wanted to send me
this one again so this one is a size
extra large and the other one is a size
large so I'm gonna keep the extra large
because the extra large fits and I'm
gonna give this size large away to
someone else it's basically like a nice
yellow yellow leather jacket and I'm
washing out right now so let me put that
down so I'll show you to you guys on the
side so - yeah it's a yellow leather
jacket it's really really cute guys very
very pretty on all skin tones I'm not
going to say only on the sisters but all
skin tones it's definitely a car that
really grabs attention it's really
really nice it's very sturdy leather
jacket and it's very warm too so you're
not gonna be freezing your tail off I
would say wear this leather jacket up
until the end of November because once
you're stepping into the December
cheering of February you definitely want
to have like a couple layers underneath
your leather jacket so maybe this one
may not be the one for you this is more
sober fashioned leather jacket so but I
thought it was really cute very nice
guys and I'll be giving away one of
these um I've been giving away the size
large jacket to one of you lucky lucky
lucky subscribers so but I do like that
a lot guys and that's one of my favorite
items so the next thing that I got set
is this really cute skirt now I did not
select this skirt but I'm happy that
they sent it to me now one discrepancy
with the skirt is that the skirt is
incredibly incredibly too short but it's
shorter in the backs in the front it's
kind of like a little short but
something I could get away with and it
is tight
so they sent me a size to us 14 and it's
funny these sizes are just really crazy
like I can wear a lot of different sizes
either wear size 12 size 14 size 15 and
it all depends on the stretch material
and stuff like that so you always off
you always have to keep those things
into consideration when you're trying on
stuff so I don't know but they said this
one to me in a 14 and it's kind of one
of those leather skirts guys I actually
the way I combined this outfit together
and I'm gonna show you guys to talk to
you because I actually wore the top is
from them as well so I kind of combine
outfit together and I definitely would
wear that outfit so the only thing I
would say is if you're gonna wear this
skirt I highly recommend you wear a long
cardigan just because it's too short
what I would do with this skirt is wear
a long cardigan my high-top vans and
what I mean long cardigan cardigan that
kind of hits the back of your kneecaps
so and what do you call that space that
bone in the back mmm it's buzzing me so
um I would definitely wear a long
cardigan that hits all the way towards
the back of your kneecap just to kind of
like ease the outfit in because you
don't want to step up to someone with
that start and they're gonna be like
what girl do not wear that so I would
kind of say we're a little bit of things
on top of it to kind of ease the viewers
when they first see it cause it's a
little bit shocking it's a little bit
sexy too but I definitely like it kind
of ask to patterns on it
so it kind of has like the snake print
leather right here a plain leather right
here and for the back it has a diagonal
zip so when you're zipping yourself up
it has like a diagonal zip which is
really sexy I think that disappeared
with the screen t was like when I when I
tried it on I was like reviewing the
footage I was like wow this was good
miss Kurt is definitely tired what's his
skirt was maybe like a 15 a little bit
stretch here in the abdomen area because
I haven't like a nice muffin down there
but I don't care I thought it'd still
look nice you know still be happy I was
still happy with the look I thought it
was fabulous our death would wear this
but I would kind of tone it down with
other like additives like a jacket or
something like that so it's just not too
distracting and people aren't just like
shocked when they furnish Alesi you but
I thought that this was absolutely
adorable
and thank you for sending it to me I'd
even select this like wow
so the next thing I'm going to show you
guys is the screen tea that I paired two
paired it off with so this screen tea I
guess Apple just thinks I'm basically
like a big bitch cuz they keep sending
me stuff that says hunger on it but it's
funny because I actually selected this
one so I'm not too offended because I
knew and I picked this one out so this
is never not hungry and like I said
everybody who knows me knows I'm a
greedy and I'm a big so I love this
guy's never not hungry totally mean it
totally vibes with me this is who I am
this is what I do I like to eat yes oh
my god yeah the next thing I'm going to
show you guys are two dresses that I
thought were cute now the first one guys
is definitely a little bit daring I
would highly recommend wearing this with
leggings or some type of dark stockings
with like boots or something to kind of
flip it a little bit now this one was
definitely way too short but I did like
the color of the design it's more so
like a summer dress honestly and I
didn't select this dress they sent this
one to me random so it was nice it was a
nice idea a nice gesture like I said I'm
going on vacation anyway so I'm gonna
just kind of fold this out wear this out
so it has like a cute little design
Paisley designer we're not Paisley some
type of floor design stitching now I did
have to close this in a little bit
because the way that it dipped down into
the breast area was a little bit too
long it's supposed to be kind of like a
nice Furley girly kind of dress why do
you have all this open cleavage and I
just didn't understand that for this
dress it's just the way that they had a
cleavage area open and the whole theme
of the dress just didn't make sense and
coincide so I was just kind of confused
about that so I bet you use my needle
and thread and close it up just a little
bit in the front so that you didn't get
like like deep long v boobage like it
was just weird so I closed it up a
little bit and kind of made the dress
more uniform make the dress more classy
so I definitely would say if you're
going to wear this wear it with thick
stockings like stockings that are like
that thick not that thin material and
wear some nice little boots with it in
the fedora hat and just make it like a
fun girly outfit and even pull like a
leather jacket or even a jean jacket
with it to make it more of like a girly
fun look you can definitely change this
up and
I mean thick stockings guys do not wear
those little thin stockings wear those
nice thick stockings with nice boots I
think that would actually look really
nice and if you even want to be extra
careful you can even pull that little
break a short black biker shorts
underneath it so that you're not really
exposing yourself to everyone so I
definitely thought that this was cute I
just thought it was too short and but
there's always ways to kind of fix it so
you're not going outside looking
half-naked yeah so the next thing that I
got actually really liked it's one of my
favorite items I kind of saw envision
this differently when I buy clothes on
these websites the way that the clothes
are cut never really fit me just because
of my assets so it looks like it's gonna
be bagging on the website because the
model that's wearing as she's rocking
it's looking baggy in her you got to
keep in mind those models are weight
thinner flatter they have they don't
really have assets most of them don't
have assets at all so you got to keep
that in mind when buying these clothes
so when I picked this velvet dress out
and it's a size large and I believe the
other dress I just showed you guys with
size large as well so this is a size
large it was the biggest size they had
and when the model had it on it looked
nice slouchy and like wonderful but when
I tried it on it was like gurram fitting
I'm sucking in on your leg so I really
care it really like extension in my body
but I love I love it I love it guys it's
super super soft super super warm
comfortable every single thing about
this just this so cute has pockets in
the front I just saw so many outfit like
I just saw so many looks with this like
so many hairstyles and I know you guys
laugh every single time I do a try and
haul when I tried clothes on I have to
pick out the right wig to wear with the
clothes I don't want to just come on
here and show you guys cools I'll go
here I go you know let me try the
clothes no big deal let me just show
them they don't care I want to give you
guys a full effect the full vision of
the look the only thing I'm missing
without putting the shoes on the heel
bag and all that kind of stuff but y'all
need to see that you guys need to see
the hair that goes with the outfit
because the hair hair really changes
people
honestly like hair can either make or
break an outfit so that's why I like to
show you guys these Tryon halls with
different hairstyles and things like
ways that I would wear it so that you
guys are more comfortable more confident
when you're shopping on this website so
keep that in mind
so anyways guys I love this dress it's a
nice it fits this form fitted it
definitely accentuates the body like my
butt was looking really good in this it
has those nice pockets in the front so
you could just shove like little things
in there nothing major you don't want to
weigh the pockets down but I thought
that this was so cute guys and I love
this so much I don't know if velvet it's
just really trending again this year it
was the last season thing too and I
guess it's back this season again but
it's definitely really pulling on my
heartstrings like I just I love it like
I love everything about it it just looks
great and oh my god I love you guys
definitely to get that it's like number
one so the next two things that I got
guys I'm not going to show you guys up
close because the camera the light will
wash me out they're both two white items
and there are crop tops now these are
also my two favorite items and I'm not
sure if I particularly selected these
items but I'm happy that I got them so
the first one is basically kind of like
this cross over crop top
so basically it kind of ties in the
front it's kind of off the shoulders I
absolutely absolutely love this top guys
when I initially got I was like I didn't
pick this out like why do they send this
to me and with me I'm kind of like a
little cautious about Mike my fat roll
my stomach roll I like this nice little
pouch underneath my breast which is kind
of weird and I wish I would have got a
lipo when I got my breast implants but I
didn't because I didn't think about it
back then and plus I gained more weight
like I've gained weight in the last year
or two so well act in the last three
years I've gained weight so it sound
like whatever so I'm really cautious
about that part but whatever so I tried
this on and I it was so cute guys and I
just think that with the jeans that I
had on it just look really nice together
and you just basically tied that area up
in the breast part and then you kind of
pull it off the shoulder now this is the
first one that I saw like I haven't seen
this in with any other company where
it's off the shoulder and you could tie
it up so it kind of gives you like a
little curtsy on your breast area so it
kind of gives you like a little curtain
and it just really makes it's like a
really sexy look and I really really
liked it and I think the whole jeans
together and the wig that I don't know
that this wig on if I put oh I did I had
this wig on it just kind of gave me more
of like a sexy sultry feel I listen did
you guys see that
did you guys
pull up on the screen bitch so the next
one I got is similar it's way but this
one's a little it's cuter - I like this
as well now this one has a little bit of
a crochet detailing on the sleeves which
I like and I just thought the crocheted
detailing on the season made the outfit
made the top look more girly more
paisley more you know innocent I do like
the little gold accent that they applied
on the actual front part the gold
accents was really cute as well - it's a
nice crop top I think it went well with
the jeans as well what I don't probably
do with these crop tops is wear like a
little faux fur jacket on top of it
maybe a leather jacket and just some
like really small heels nothing real
major and it just looks like a really
nice date night outfit I don't know
something about it was just so cute and
live with that when I wore my longer
wing and I just I don't know I just I
was feeling it like I just I just really
liked it and like I like the way the
jeans fit and that jeans are from mono
tanks comm so if you didn't watch my try
and haul for their jeans
those are jeans aren't size 15 and I
love those jeans they really cut you
nice and have you looking like all types
of snack so these are my favorite tops
guys I look like one thing about they're
full if you're looking for like cute
tops trendy tops they have a lot of
trendy tops for me because I'm a little
bit curvier and plus-sized I don't wear
I don't like buying the pants on them
because the pants don't fit me so I try
to stay a little bit away from there and
I select more so of the dresses and the
tops because you can never go wrong with
dresses and tops well sometimes you can
but in this situation in this case today
I actually was really successful so the
last thing I'm going to show you guys is
this jacket that I tried on no I kept
putting this up to the camera and trying
it on when I was up for the trying
fortune and I just kept getting washed
out by the line I'm just sitting like
okay you're watching yeah you're
watching me out like like come on why is
this watching me out so I'm gonna kind
of show to you guys on a slant so it's
basically a bomber Jack and I didn't
select this one they sent this one to me
now it you know I don't even know what
sizes it's let's see what size it is I
think this jacket is it's right it's
actually bigger than I thought it's
probably like a size extra-large or 2x
now I didn't initially select this
jacket not even initially I didn't
select this jacket at all they sent this
to me
randomly and my mom saw and she died so
I'm gonna actually give it to my mother
I was gonna give it away but then when
she saw it she was like oh my god I love
this jack and it fit her so I was like
you know I'm gonna give it to my mom so
it's basically like a bomber it's like a
bomber jacket it's like a really cute
pink color I initially liked it when I
saw it because I had these really cool
sneakers that I just bought that kind of
had like the same kind of like glaze on
it but when I tried it on I was like my
kind of big and I didn't really see a
way that I could wear it so I just said
to myself you know well let me give it
to someone who's actually gonna wear so
I'm gonna give it to my mother I'm
probably not even gonna wear this so I
don't want to keep something that's not
gonna be worn so hence why I'm gonna do
giveaways so I'm gonna give this away to
my mom it's cute it's it actually fits
nice if you like over oversized jackets
if this was a little bit longer meaning
if it came a little bit past my butt and
it was still at this color and oversized
like long line I would have to keep it
but it stops in a word spot to be that
big so I just I'm just good without it I
don't even want it but it's definitely a
nice jacket guys very warm it was up to
keep you warm you can actually wear like
a sweater underneath it or you know just
kind of figure it out style it up so my
mom's gonna be a lucky lady today when I
handed her she's gonna be like yes I'm
winning and I usually give her some of
my stuff like if she could fit her my
mom has like skinny legs and like big
breasts so she really can't fit the
jeans that I wear so yeah all right guys
