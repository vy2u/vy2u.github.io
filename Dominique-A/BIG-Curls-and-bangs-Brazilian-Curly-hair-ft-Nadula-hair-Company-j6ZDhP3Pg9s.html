hair review
so today's here review is brought to you
guys from a company called no Dooley
hair company off of Aliexpress so they
sent me some bundles of here in a
closure
so I created a custom unit for this
review today and I hope you guys like it
so it's a bit different from what I
usually do I was kind of like a little
skeptical in the beginning but it came
out perfect so guys I will link down all
the information down below for you guys
if you guys are interested I was set for
bundles of 24 inch curly hair along with
the 20 inch closure everything will be
linked down below for you guys who
doesn't interested if you want to see
what this unit looks like and what I did
to pull a it up a little bit I would
like you to stay tuned and keep on
watching yeah
ah
alright guys I don't even know where to
start with this on because I am so light
like it's just you honestly and truly
it's just becoming so ridiculous now
like like I've been having like this
hair like like come on like I'm not even
joking right now guys like look at this
hair this is insane so I had to I have
three options I could even do the middle
part a side part or I could've did like
maybe like one of those up half and down
things even though it's not a full
frontal but for some reason the closure
was parted it's kind of funny kind of
had like its split like in boxes in a
way and you guys saw I win it with my
pressed powder just to kind of like put
some powder in all the parts I only did
that on purpose so that if someone's
looking down on my head they'll see that
I have some scalp itch and some areas so
that's the only reason why you guys saw
that I did that but the closure was
actually giving me here going forward so
I said okay since it's gonna give me
some hair going forward and I've never
really done a hairstyle like this on my
channel why not just go in for the kill
so what I do is I just kind of randomly
snipped like the front pieces that were
coming off the closure and then a little
bit around the size I clipped like one
or two guys listen I didn't expect this
from this unit at all my joy I didn't do
anything to this hair I didn't put any
products and I didn't you know I didn't
do anything but guys this is now I was I
was thinking like maybe I should add
some color in this I could've did some
blonde balayage all the running even
went at the tips right here and did a
little bit of blonde and made it really
kind of like autumn toned in a way guys
I may have to come with that like look
look it like look at the look at the
pack I got it I just I don't even and
I'm not trying to say like I'm coming
here every week slang but this is very
very slay foe
like if you and this is a hairstyle like
even if you're not a big hair type of
person like just pulling this off oh my
god guys and this is funny like this is
just so funny but I must get straight to
it it doesn't tangle so far but with
curly hair I'm not gonna make excuses
curly hair tangles no matter what so
that's just something you're gonna have
to prepare for I didn't receive any
shedding I did use all the bundles guys
I use every single last bundle and that
was four bundles of 24 inch and a 20
inch closure so everything is basically
occupied in this unit it is currently so
it's super big I did go to my white
tooth comb and kind of tweeze it
teased it a little bit because I wanted
a little bit more off in this area I did
notice that the ends were like a little
like a baby ish and kind of like frail
so I did go in and kind of snip the ends
a little bit because I'm not too fond of
that I really wanted the reason why I
got 24 inches because I wanted the
length and the volume and I think it
pretty much did what any like come look
guys please come on guys like look at
this like I'm just looking so like
bohemian right now like I just feel like
I need to put like a nice dress on maybe
like some kind of like palazzo pants
crop top and some shoes and go like out
for lunch or dinner like that's how I
feel right now this year I feel so
 fab now like I said I did go in
and tease the hair a little bit right
here cuz I wanted more off right here to
give me more of like a more playful curl
look it is really nice guys I did not Co
wash it so so this is the hair straight
out the back guys and I just I just
absolutely love this guys I think it's
really really nice it is not heavy here
it's lightweight so you're not getting
like really really dense looking here my
guy said I wouldn't into cut the bangs a
little bit just to play around with it I
think it brings my face really well
which is what I like about this hair a
lot it doesn't it doesn't pull too much
away from my like face structure it
actually helps my face out better and
the curls are so pretty so guys I will
link down everything down below for this
unit you guys already know I'm above the
roof for this like I'm this is this is
right here
right here now and I've been complaining
about Aliexpress space companies saying
that they're not that good you know I've
been having bad experiences put this one
a plus so guys that's all for today's
