with another hair view so on today's
video I'm going to show you guys some
here from Aliexpress calm now this
company that I'm working with is called
Julia hair comp Julia hair company now
they are very popular I've seen them all
over Instagram Facebook freaking YouTube
and everyone has been reviewing me here
like crazy
it is very affordable here guys and they
sent me four bundles of Brazilian stray
hair and a closure now I got 4 22 inch
bundles in an 18 inch closure and I
created a unit myself now I haven't done
a unit with a closure in a long time so
I kinda have to like figure this out and
I kind of feel like I made my unit a
little bit tight just because I'm not
used to using that little space anymore
making wigs now recently frontals and
all that kind of stuff has been very
popular and it's been like brainwashing
the system so it's kind of different but
I was able to come out with a really
pretty unit now I did absolutely nothing
to this hair guys I just installed it
and then I just that was that so the
hair does come with kind of like a fake
little like wave in it I guess it's just
the packaging wave that has it is a
really nice silky straight textured unit
guys and it's very pretty it's supposed
to be natural colors but it's almost
like a one be almost black color and I
really was looking for a black unit like
a jet-black unit so I might show you
guys a jet-black unit in my next with
one thing let's see
but for this for the purposes of this
video this is a natural color here and
this is the front the closure in the
front the closure is very well done it's
a nice closure all I did was just add
the powder to it this is the inside of
my cap obviously you can see I have the
styrofoam head peat bugs in it but this
is the closure right here guys and I did
add an elastic band on it to give me a
little bit more tightness and support
and I think I oldies because my head is
tight girl so I want to show you guys
what this looks like on my head like I
said this was a very quick way of doing
a hairstyle and I chose to do this in
middle part just because I wanted like a
nice solid middle part wig and this hair
gave me the ability to do that so I've
been interested in seeing what this
thing looks like on my head I would like
alright guys so this is what the unit
looks like guys like I said I didn't do
anything to it but just plop it on my
head now I did put press powder on the
cap way before so it's the same press
powder or link it down below from BH
Cosmetics contour kit now the unit guys
like I said there's really not so much
to do because I'm not gluing it down I'm
not doing baby hairs I'm not doing all
that extra mess I did not straighten the
hair I did not curl the hair this is
just a pattern that came with the hair
when it came in the pack so it's just
kind of like that machine wave or
whatever and that's about it so let me
show you guys how long the hair is so
the hair lands just like below your
breast area it is very long and smoothly
22 inches but I think it's more like a
24 inch to be honest with you guys the
hair is very soft guys no tangling I get
a little bit of shedding that's because
I cut some of the West but other than
that I don't get any tangling in the
nape area or anything like that the hair
is solid I ask I know this is how much
hair was left after I made the unit it's
just a little little bit of hair so you
definitely could fit everything on your
dome cap I kind of doubled the back
tracks the first bundle and then I kind
of do individual like tracks just
because I wanted the unit to lay flat
and not be too bulky because with
straight hair you just don't want to
have that extra bulk so I will come back
with a styling tutorial in this hair and
I might tie the hair jet-black just
because a jet-black here in the
summertime looks just something about
it's just so so sexy so I might come
back and do that guys do not forget to
