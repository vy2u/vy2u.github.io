four hey guys so I am back so today is
going to be another Kirby slash sticker
of chine hi guys so today it's just
gonna be a collective haul so I'm gonna
show you guys some stuff I picked up for
forever 21 rainbow man Greg and Primark
now let's also set some stuff in my peel
box I'll show you guys the stuff that it
was sent as well now I'll try to lick my
peel box down below if you guys want to
send me gifts letters or whatever all
your gifts and stuff are welcome so if I
do start getting a fluctuation of kind
of letters and stuff like that I'll kind
of add that into my videos by reading
them during like my shrine hauls none of
my charm I was like makeup stores and
stuff like that so when that time comes
we will you know reach that ladder but
for now I will link all the items down
below if you're interested in purchasing
anything I have to show today now if
you're interested in seeing what I have
to offer in today's trying haul guys I
would like you to stay attuned and keep
on line alright guys so the first store
actually went to this time was Matt
Graham now Matt Greg in Brooklyn is
located right next to rainbows so it's
kind of like similar stores but they
kind of saw their stuff for just a
little bit cheaper than rainbow so I did
feature this in my last rainbow trying
haul I was like kind of like a
collective haul as well so the first
thing I got is this cute army fatigue
tube top right here now this one is in a
size large guys it's super duper
stretchy super duper nice now I have
that double pleated or double lot
aligned type of material so therefore if
you don't wear a bra with this one
you're not gonna have like super hard
nips which is great so you definitely
have like full coverage in this one it's
really really stretchy guys so if you do
if you're kind of size like me you can
definitely size down to medium just
because it's super stretchy and if you
wanted to kind of hold and suck your
boobs in and all that kind of stuff
really well I definitely say go down one
size one thing I like about this guys
it's a true army fatigue pattern it's
not that kind of fake kind of like
polyester type this is cotton so it has
that great like army fatigue quality and
look to it which I really like so
definitely look into this guys cuz this
is definitely something I would like to
you know I would consider getting this
was about like $5 so it was a great deal
as well too so the next topic is
actually pretty trendy I'm actually
pieced this entire outfit together so I
got this checkered style top and it's
like
crop-top of the tie front now this one
is really cute guys it says super on it
initially I thought it said supreme but
that'll be kind of like copyright
because supreme is actually a brand so
this one says super on it's very cute
I got this one in a size large as well -
this one fits very nice now this one
actually has that kind of like a mixed
pattern like a polyester and cotton so
when you put it on it really hugs and
sucks your body and really nicely which
is nice I do like how I paired it off
with these pants
now these pants I didn't realize I got
these in the wrong size - actually I
actually got back home now I got these
in a size and medium guys which is like
come on like medium so these are super
stretchy guys these are kind of like the
pants that I really like if you're their
form of leggings but they're kind of
like a more structured type of leggings
so it is all black and it has like this
nice white bin on the side for accident
I wear this on an Instagram post when I
was in London and you guys loved that
entire look now these are the type of
pants I would say that I would wear with
like cute cropped tops it could either
be a dressy crop top or kind of like a
regular casual crop top like I paired
the outfit in this video I thought it'd
look really good these are very
supportive they hold you in very nicely
they do kind of give you a nice curve
out and they really form your body into
nice shape and accentuate your curves
the right way so I definitely recommend
picking these out these are size medium
like I said and these are from a Greg
and I absolutely love these guys they're
ankle style so they go all the way to
the ankle and they're tight and it's
just like the perfect pair of kind of
dressed up leggings like I honestly want
to go back and get like three more three
more pairs because that's how great
these are super super double line and
super super thick and it just kind of
gives you like the best appearance ever
moving along the next tour I'm going to
show you guys items from is actually
rainbow now at rainbow this time I
didn't pick up too much stuff just
because it actually had like the same
similar things on each rack so I was
just kind of like but no so the first
dress that I got is actually kind of one
of those casual sports dress now this
does have that perfect little white
collar trim layer thing it has it on the
sleeves as well kind of real athletic
vibey now this is a ribbed dress guys
and it's a little bit of a short style
dress I do like dresses like this guys
just because they're really nice to pair
with sneakers and stuff like that
especially in the summer when you have
like one of those kind of
outdoor type things where it's not
intense outdoors but you want to kind of
like a cute and casual vibe at the same
time so this one I got in a size large
and it fits perfect
this was priced at ten dollars and 97
cent should have been like $7.99 but
whatever um this is really cute guys
it's rib it fits the body very nice and
accentuates the curves I considered this
like a casual dress you can wear heels
with this one and put like a distressed
jean jacket on top of it or something
like that but I consider just real
casual I'm the type to wear like a
baseball cap but there or something like
that and just like regular conference
sneakers with it I thought it was nice
it's a really good stretchy material it
looks good on the body and accentuates
occurs which is great and it is on it's
not see-through so therefore you won't
really be able to see all the nooks and
crannies and stuff which is great so you
do have full coverage in this which is
an A+ so I ended up picking two
jumpsuits from a rainbow as well too now
this one our eyeball did at least twice
when I went to the store but I just
didn't know whether it's gonna be nice
when they pick it out the first time now
this one is in a size large and it was
priced at 1697 now I kind of feel like
1697 is a little bit of a reach
sometimes why do you have to add the 97
on there I couldn't you just say like
$15.99 and make it a 16 complete or just
do $14.99 make it 15 16 97 is just like
the most random is number ever and I
don't know why they do that it's kind of
annoying so this is a jumpsuit guys it
actually hits the floor it has like
those kind of love you know wide legs or
whatever this is a ribbed style jumpsuit
guys it's a burgundy color which I liked
it does have like a little bit of a
waist out that you could tie around your
waist that is attached to the jumpsuit
which is nice now if you're someone that
doesn't like to show a lot of breasts or
you know doesn't like that type of extra
exposure not everybody likes that so you
got to keep that in mind I would
definitely consider wearing maybe like a
small cameo neatness or kind of wearing
some type of full coverage bra or also
going in and closing in closing this up
a little bit I'm notorious for doing
that just because sometimes I'll have
like moments when I want to be like
boobalicious you know that's the whole
purpose of getting breast implants but
sometimes for different occasions you
don't want to expose too much so you can
go ahead and sew this up together which
I usually do sometimes just to keep a
little bit conservative one thing about
this that's a little annoying the straps
are not adjustable so whatever way you
get this strap is
where you're gonna get it you can't
change this at all which is annoying
best bet is probably to take this cut it
off of the hinge right here and then
resew it down so that it fits that
probably work but it fits very good on
me I actually like it it's not
see-through II and it actually looks
good on the physique and the body which
is always a good thing now the next
thing I got was another jumpsuit now
this is more of a casual jumpsuit and I
love it I love casual jumpsuit casual
wear and I love gray colors like really
like this nice heather gray color so I
got this heavy grey colored jumpsuit
it's more sporty it's more relaxed now
this one is ankle style as well too guys
so goes all the way to your ankles and
it fits very nice it's not the scrunchie
ankle style so it's just the ankle style
that's just kind of like you know skinny
no I do like this because it has a
little waist belt a waistband on it that
is actually like not a false one it's
real so you can dumpy tighten and loosen
this up to kind of make it fit your ways
to kind of accentuate your curves it is
a thick strap jump suit so it's very
nice I got this one in a size large and
this one was priced at $12.99 which is
an excellent price for this they have
this in a few other colors like Burgundy
I kinda think they kind of kept like the
trend of colors they had like burgundy
dark blue and stuff like that but like I
said heather gray looks really good and
I paired this off with like my blonde
hair and it just looks so good together
so I'm definitely gonna consider wearing
that outfit combination with some
sneakers I think that this is a definite
steal from rainbow guys it's only $12.99
it's so athletic it's so fresh and you
just I just feel really confident in it
it's something relaxed that you can
style up or style down alright guys so
moving along so now I'm gonna show you
guys the stuff I got from forever 21
now I'm not someone that really likes to
go to forever 21 to months just because
it's an overload of stuff and it just
gets really confusing and I just want to
mention that I do have the central air
on so you'll hear it in the background
but hopefully it's not distracting it's
a little bit annoying to me right now
that I can hear it it'll go off of
auto-tune so you guys should be fine now
I'm gonna show you guys a few things I
got I did get our three dresses now I
picked out the three dresses cuz I was
going away and I wanted to kind of have
like a going out dress fYI going out for
me is just non-existent now like I went
out one night and when I was in London
it just it just was not it's just not
the same anymore I don't know if it's
because I'm in like my
20s I'm just kind of like over it I
can't even drink like that anymore
either it's just kind of a phase that
I'm over now I did a lot of partying
like in my early 20s so it's kind of
like forget it
but yeah so I never got the opportunity
to actually wear these dresses but I did
try them on for you guys and I do have
other places to go and things to do this
summer so I'm definitely gonna wear
these then so the first dress I'm gonna
show you guys is it's really cute kind
of like what do you call khaki color
kind of like a dark tan color chocolate
color coffee color so this is the first
dress I really really liked his dress a
lot guys its body con it's a size large
and I believe this dress was marked that
I took the tag off but I believe this
dress was about like $13 from forever 21
so this one is nice it has a good cup
size right here it doesn't have a
supportive cup guys so if you need
padding and stuff like that you're not
gonna get that with this dress it does
have like a little key kind of like a
little scrunchie part in the breast area
I only like that just because it gave it
just a little bit of an accent some
people don't like it but I'm okay with
it this just is pretty long it stops
like right above the knee which is cool
it's not a supportive dress guys so if
you're someone that wants to wear
shapewear and stuff like that I
recommend wearing kind of like Spanx
instead instead of wearing like a full
shapewear I don't really like the strap
shapewear too much with dresses like
that because it's gonna be obvious and I
don't really like wearing stuff like
that on my shoulders so if you're gonna
wear a shaper with this one I recommend
wearing like the panty shapewear just
because this type of dress is very
sucking it's very fitted so if you have
those nuts and crannies and you're not
comfortable with that
you know what deal with it and just be
good with it as long as you look at
flying it don't even matter so I
definitely think that this is a nice
dress with the price the color trend
right now is this kind of like Camel
coffee color so definitely look into
these cause that I saw a lot at forever
21
now the next dress I'm going to show you
guys is this really cute dress this one
was also one that I saw in a rack and I
fell in love now I'm someone who has
like big shoulders like I'm pretty hefty
top-heavy like sometimes now I was a
little afraid of this one because I had
an experience with forever 21 before
buying like little straps like this the
last experience I had I lifted my arm up
and it popped immediately so I was a
little wary so I got this in a size
large and thank God it fit because I was
fearful that was gonna fit this one fits
great on the brass guys it
- and very nice this does not have
coverage on it guys so there's no
padding you just have to deal with it
the way it comes and I know that's harsh
to say but I mean I don't know so it's
very very skimpy guys it almost has kind
of like this fake you know what kind of
it almost has kind of like that fake
suede material but it's not suede
material it looks very nice guys it's
super strappy it has like a little
crisscross pattern in the back which is
nice it's a little bit on the short side
but I would say we're flat sandals with
there or something instead of wearing
heels just because more height more
peekaboo so I'm just be careful with
that but I do think that this is very
nice guys it's a great color I don't
know if this is part of the trend but
the color is great now the next dress
that I got is actually a white dress and
I don't do white dresses now when I try
this on I try this white dress on with
my long black jet-black hair oh god I
love the entire look I really wish I
have an event like I like I'm hoping I
have an event to go to just because this
dress with like a jet-black wig girl
okay so this is another bodycon dress
guys I got this one in a size large this
one was marked as twelve thousand ninety
cents and that's probably why I got it I
don't have any white dresses this one
was the perfect example of a great dress
for a curvy bodies or whatever bodies it
does have a great cup area in the breast
area it doesn't have any like padding in
it but it definitely conceals and kind
of lines your boobs in a right way it
does have a little tight area in the
front which I'm not I really don't care
about I think this is kind of like the
trend now so I'm not really too fond of
that this dress comes right above the
knee as well to you guys so it has kind
of like a nice clean sex appeal to it
but it's also kind of like we're fine at
the same time just because it's not
short which is great and that's one
reason why I got it it is a little bit
sexy in the breast area but it's just
it's not too sexy where you can actually
go somewhere with this if you pull you
know you know arrange your boobs the
right way if you go somewhere you can
actually pull this off and be just so
elegant in it I absolutely love the
black hair with it it's just the whole
entire look was just a one now the next
thing and the last thing I got from
forever 21 is this little crop top and I
saw this this came in actually a few
different colors and initially when I
saw this I was like yes so this is
actually 9090 cents and I usually
won't spend that much money on a crop
top because it doesn't make sense but I
do like how it's like kind of like one
of those kind of uniform type crop tops
now i styled in this video until after i
actually filmed the clips cuz i feel in
the clothes way before i do the talk
part i didn't realize that my boobs look
huge in this thing guys so please be
prepared now this is a really cute crop
top guys it is kind of like a sweater
material but not a real sweater material
it has its full white with black
trimming which is why i love it i don't
know if these kind of mono colors not of
course a you say whatever black and
white grace you know what i mean i don't
know if that type of thing is kind of
popular now as well with the camel
colors and the khaki colors but i've
seen a lot of these kind of like you
know color blocks but this is not really
color block but it's kind of like one of
those kind of modern kind of style like
you know look I thought it was cute I
paired it with some distressed jeans I
had from mono teks or from fashion over
there are great they were distressed so
the outfit was kind of as a mixed outfit
because you can either dress this up or
justice down I got this in a size large
I could have got a size medium if I
really want it to be tight but like I
said because my boobs are bigger than I
noticed before I think the size large it
works well it definitely has full
coverage guys you don't have to worry
about hard nipples and stuff like that
it just covers really nicely it is a
thicker material and I just thought that
the Alpha combination was cute and I
actually would consider you know
recommend getting this they had a few
other colors like another they have a
khaki and white they had like yellow and
white and stuff like that so definitely
look into this crop top I actually think
it's like a really nice craft alright
guys so I did tell you guys that I
received some stuff in my peel box as
well now try to lick my peel box down
below for you guys in all my videos so
that if you want to send me something
you can go ahead and send me anything
you want letters or whatever I actually
really want to read some letters from
you guys so if you want to send me
letters definitely just check the peel
box down below and send me a letter too
now the first thing I got from this
company called chocolate girl when I
initially opened this I was freaking
happy now if you guys know me on the low
I like tie-dye so if you watch some of
my videos I'll have like a tie-dye shirt
in I'm from here and there I even like
if I go on a trip or something I'll look
for tie-dye kind of like souvenirs
t-shirts all the time so this company
sent me
this tie-dye hoodie hoodie guys like so
this is like the perfect idea hoodie now
this one says all black in it like come
on guys so this is definitely like
something that I honestly and truly am
so freaking blessed and happy to have
received I have not seen something this
cool in a long time guys
now if you grew up in the 1990s you know
all that and there's use a show called
all that on Nickelodeon so the fact that
says all black is totally doped guys now
I got this one they sent it to me in a
size medium which it fit perfect I wish
it was like kind of bigger so I could
wear it kind of like an address style
but it's definitely something you could
wear with like leggings and stuff like
that I think this is very nice guys
regardless if it's a summertime I
doesn't matter
I'm still gonna rock it on the cold
nights and even when like spring when
like the fall and autumn really comes in
you will see me wearing this like crazy
I'm definitely really thankful thank you
so much chocolate girl for sending this

tie-dye item like this and I'm totally
stoked this is amazing so I will link
their website down below if you want to
purchase anything from them like we're

type of you know all-black tie-dye
hooding no we're alright guys so I came
just a little bit closer to the camera
because I want to show you guys these
things up close so I also got sent some
makeup from a company called Shay
artistry now she actually sent me this
stuff from Bronx which is actually like
20 minutes from where I lived 20 25 men

actually like these these are actually
really really nice guys and if you know

wearing stuff like that so then the next
pair of lashes she sent me are kind of
more of a natural style lash these are
the type of lashes I like to wear if I'm
not doing like a heavy heavy makeup look
just something real simple so this is
called dreamer it also has kind of like
the wispy vibe to it but it's not super
super thick super super dramatic which
is definitely fun if you're going for
more really natural looks and I do not
you look sometimes but I like to do my
little winged eyeliner drama
yeah I'm pretty much basic guys honestly
but these are really nice I'm definitely
try this out for like a natural everyday

them so she sent me one that kind of has
a gold shimmers in it and this one's
called they're both treasurer one is
made with rose water and one is made
with the other one doesn't say but one
is obviously like really shimmery gold
so this one is like kind of like
everyone's creating these like really
kind of like shimmer setting sprays and
I haven't gotten the chance to use these
but I'm definitely to try this out now
this one says is compare been free
alcohol-free and oil free which is great
so she definitely lists what is in here
