today with another wig review now this
wig review is brought to you guys by
China here Maul calm and this is the
first time I'm working with them and
they have absolutely great great
products so this is a full cap wig with
a little bit of soap lace at the top and
it's a full bang wig I've never done a
full bang like before and I absolutely
love this obviously I've done it in two
styles I ended up cutting the leg into
this q mob style which I absolutely love

videos for you guys and I hope that you
guys enjoy this video I want you guys to
stay tuned
you
alright guys so this is how it looks
when I cut it I know you guys probably
didn't bitch while you cut that hair but
I wanted to just do something different
just like I'm just so over doing like
the same hairstyle so me cutting this I
feel like it looks better it just looks
more um less structured and more fun I
hope you guys get what I mean when I say
that I just think that this looks really
good like this so if you do one of your
purchases here I probably don't get a
20-inch maybe get like something that's
short if you want to go for this look I
cut it blunt like I did my last unit
that I showed you guys and just kind of
like added some soft waves into it and
kind of feather the bangs out a little
bit just to make it look like it's not
so uniform one thing I don't like about
like Chinese bangs is if when it's like
really uniformed because it just doesn't
look it just doesn't look natural
especially with wigs so I hope you guys
thought that this video was informative
