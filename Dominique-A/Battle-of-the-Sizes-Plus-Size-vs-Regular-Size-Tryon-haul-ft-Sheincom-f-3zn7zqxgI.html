today with another curvy slash stick
girl trying huh so today it's gonna be a
little bit of a surprise today so today
I will be featuring my younger sister
Danny in this video so we are going to
do plus size versus regular size
featuring she inside.com
so we'll link all the information down
below if you're interested in purchasing
any of these products and if you're
interested in seeing what we have to
offer in today's video guys I would like
you to stay tuned and keep them hi guys
so everything I picked out today is in a
size medium so the first thing that I
got to pick out was this cute melanin
t-shirt of course I got it because I am
melanin got it and I love the way this
fits it actually fits like a normal
t-shirt it's not I think it's cotton but
I'm not 100% sure but it's still a
really nice t-shirt and it fits really
well I wish I would have gotten it in a
large so it could have been a little
looser because I like to wear my
t-shirts looser but this still fits
really nice and yeah I actually paired
this with these this romper jumpsuit
type of thing in the Tri important and I
got the romper in a medium as well and
it fits its ill-fitting so I can't say
I'm 100% in love with this I think the
concept is really good but it just
didn't fit well the straps aren't
adjustable and you need to wear
something underneath well I need to wear
something underneath has um if you don't
just like everything is showing like
your underwear like your bra everything
will be showing so I paired it with the
melanin t-shirt and I had to really tuck
in the melanin t-shirt so you couldn't
see any of my body parts on the sides
but other than that but
concept is good I just wish they
executed it a lot better especially in
terms of straps if they would have done
something with the straps I think it
would have fit a lot better than it
actually did so yeah the next thing I
picked up were these high-waisted shorts
now that I'm looking at them I might be
colorblind but I feel like they're navy
blue in person but I thought on the
website they were gonna be black so yeah
but you know what I also thought the
material was gonna be a lot different I
thought they were gonna be like the
loose-fitting like like you know slouchy
loungy type of material but they're
actually like a structured like
polyester material they fit really well
I like that they're high-waisted and it
comes with like a little belt that goes
around I think that's really cute I just
wish it was a different material cuz now
I feel like I can't really wear this
casually I would have to wear this like
dress top so yeah but I I'm I guess I
can just figure it out and make it work
I paired it in the video I paired it
with this crop top that I got it's like
this black crop top I know you've seen
this a ton of times like they sell these
on like every single website but like I
would see this on like maybe like a
different website for like maybe 20
dollars like 10 15 20 dollars and I
think it was on this website for like
maybe like five six eight dollars so
that's a really good deal and this is
actually really good material it's legit
like the ones you find on those like
popular websites forever21 fashion Nova
like so I was really happy with this I
love this shirt it feels so nice like a
real like cotton or
like that real nice kind polyester
material so I'm excited about this one
then I picked up this really cute wild
thoughts Rihanna inspired dress I think
it's so cute it's red and it's a little
short and it was a little snob even
though I got it in a medium I but I feel
like if I would have gotten in enlarge
it would have been too big but it's
super cute I was really hesitant about
picking it out I was like um I don't
think it's gonna be what I think it is
the material is like a like a hard type
of not hard but it's like that plastic
it feels like plastic but I know it's
like a polyester but that stick
polyester material but it's still super
cute I wish they would have at least put
this band like to be like red or
something that white band on the top is
just throwing me off completely but it's
super cute I'm definitely gonna wear
this this summer probably when I go to
Toronto for Caribana yeah so I think
this is super cute then the next items I
got were in white I love the color white
cuz I just feel like it makes me look so
like fresh and clean Angelica almost so
I got a white crop top that has like
that lettuce type of cut on it if it's
so well actually I'm gonna give a little
disclaimer that day that I did the Tryon
portion I had a beautiful delicious
Peruvian meal that day and I was almost
feeling really stuffed
so that might be like definitely
displayed in the Tryon but other than
that Adam I don't care it was it was
so the crop-top it fits really nicely
it's long sleeves it comes down just
enough where I feel comfortable you can
wear it with high-waisted jeans and
stuff and it looks really cute then the
next item that I got was a white romper
I was saying too much of a fan of the
romper the the band at the top was so
hard it's so stiff it was like crushing
my chest almost so I don't know what
type of elastic band that was but it was
like heavy duty and it was just so tight
on my chest and then just like the rest
of the like romper the bottom portion it
just so it just wasn't doing it for me
but I kind of picked it because I love
rompers because they're so easy to throw
on but I just probably wouldn't have
gone with that one if I had a choice but
yeah so the last item I got was a white
button-up and I always love picking up
button-ups because I think they're so
personal I could wear them to work or
just wear them casually so I do love
this button-up it's super cute the only
two things that I have an issue with
this button-up is that the collar is
just so stiff like I don't know what
what they put in that collar but it's
it's really stiff and it just like
stands up so that was weird and then the
pocket it was like a full pocket so it
just pretty much had a flap it was like
no reaching your hand putting little
trinkets bobby pins in there it was just
a legit flap so that was weird but
overall everything I got fit pretty well
I'm very happy with the selections I got
I love the crop tops I love the dress
and
yeah so I recommend it for you know
average science and women like me cuz
everything I got was just you know
anyone so thanks sky alright guys so
this time around I didn't pick out a lot
of stuff but just got a few things so
the first thing I want to show you guys
is this dress and this is actually my
favorite item out of the bunch now this
dress is super cute guys it's kind of
like one of those nice kind of skater
style dresses now it is a really cute
orange color apricot color and it has
kind of like a crochet blue detailing
and some nice kind of white what do you
call these white are more fan sleeves I
don't know what you call it but has that
type of sleeve I think that this dress
is really cute guys if it's very nice I
picked this one on a size zero XL 0 XL I
believe transitions into extra-large so
I'll do a zero XL to one XL on this
website so this one is a zero XL and it
fits very well one thing I want to point
out is if you have large breasts you're
gonna have issues closing it up my eyes
actually didn't really close that well
so I do have kind of like that gaping
spot on the front but I do like this a
lot it's a very nice color it's kind of
like perfect for the spring and summer
so I definitely was like yes with this
one now the next thing I got it's kind
of funny because I saw something like
this on ninis nene leakes her Instagram
page which I guess she sells clothes now
so this was a completely different card
that I saw on her she I kinda like a
rainbow color jumps too so this one is
kind of like a blue black pink tan and
white type of jumpsuit now this is not
my first choice to something that I pick
I saw it on the website was like let me
see what I can kind of do with this now
is this something that would necessarily
wear out the house like if I had like
somewhere to go probably not and if you
kind of like a last resort type of
outfit now it is a cute jumpsuit guys it
has the stripes going all the way down
now the way that they created this was
kind of funny the cut in the crotch area
is a little bit long so I don't like
that cut at all it looks funny it kind
of gives you a camel toe but I do like
how they put like a little accent belt
on it and it's kind of form-fitting it
fits your curves another thing about
this jumpsuit it's not modest guys so
therefore if you're not looking to wear
a lot of breasts this is gonna show a
lot of breasts so therefore you're gonna
have your babies hanging out it's gonna
be kind of like wobbly wobbly wobbly
whoa-whoa-whoa it's gonna be a lot of
stuff so I don't recommend this to
someone who's not modest or someone who
can't keep up with this cuz this is kind
of sexy but it definitely is really cute
it go it touches the ground guys it's
kind of like a wide-leg it's so
basically I'm five four and a half
inches tall so mine it's kind of like
dances the ground but I do like it it
looks nice and I thought you know I can
find something to somewhere to go with
it but it's just not my first choice of
things to wear now the third thing that
I have is this great navy blue jumpsuit
now I'm always skeptical to pick these
on the website just because I know my
body type and the way they cut these
pieces are always incorrect so I took
chances with this one and chose this one
out now this one is cute it's like a
satin material it's not your most
expensive material guys so it's kind of
like a mix of a kind of cheap satin
material but it'll do now this one I got
in a size zero XL and the other jumpsuit
are guarding zero XL as well so it's
very long it goes down to your ankles it
does have like pockets in it it's a
really nice look really a clean look now
the thing with this one like I said the
construction is very weird the torso
area stops very high so if you have a
short torso it's kind of look kind of
funny on you you have like a long camel
and if you have like a long torso it's
probably gonna be a better fit for you
just because the torso on this one is
kind of weird if you know what I mean
when they create these things they don't
think of all that the crotch length and
they don't think about like your like
upper body length I guess it's just
always really weird but I thought that
just cute this is something I would wear
if I had like some low key event to go
to it flats or if I had like to go like
somewhere quick you know nothing like
really important I think that this is
really nice the color is nice it fits
really nice it covers the body the way
you needed to and you're not overly
exposed and you could definitely wear
this going to a lot of places even to
work if you work out that office or
something I think this is great like I
said I got my class in a zero or XL and
if it's perfect if it's just like an
extra large if you're if you're like a
little bit kind of worried about arms
and thighs fitting into this material I
actually had no issues it has like a
little bit of a stretch to it as well
now the next thing I'm going to show you
guys are these jean shorts that I got
now I picked this up purposely on the
website because I thought that they were
gonna be kind of like vintage e so these
definitely have a vintage vibe to them
which I really like now I did pair this
up with a top guys that I don't even
know where the tops at but I'll talk
about the top along with the outfit so
these shorts
they come with like this like vintagey
kind of love they're kind of like this
stress very cute now I definitely think
that these are really cute something I
wear now I got these in a size 1 XL and
I'm so happy I picked these shorts on on
one XL they are not the loosest type of
short set you would think when I picked
it on the website initially I thought
that it was going to be kind of loose
baggy kind of swaggy but it's really not
so um these are the types that I would
wear with like kind of a crop top I'll
kind of like a sweater something like
that kind of jazz it up I wouldn't go
too crazy with it just because um this
one is actually too big on my waist so
it fits my thigh area but when it comes
to my waist to have like a lot of
gapping space so I would have to put a
belt on with this one or kind of like
tie a plaid shirt over it so with this
one I paired it off with that tie dye
top now that tie dye top actually came
with us it was a set with the pants the
pants were a mess the pants were high
water as hell and they just just it was
a mess so what I decide to do is dump
the pants and keep the top the top is
cute is tie-dye it's like a tube style
top so it's really cute really fun so I
thought it was cute mm together it was
like pop and so the next item that I got
is this really cute dress guys so this
one initially when I saw it wasn't
really a big fan of it um it's
definitely a really fun dress guys it
has like a lot of floral patterns and
details on it so I call this dress kind
of like my nightie style dress so I call
it ninety dress because it's kind of
like um let's see it's like oversized
and it's just kind of like one of those
just as it has no body so with this
dress I would recommend kind of putting
like one of those belts on it to kind of
detail a style it up and put a little
detail it is pretty long so goes bum
past the knees which I like now this is
something I would dress up with
accessory items and wear like his flat
sandals or flats just to make it look
jazzy but I do like it is a nice kind of
like polyester cotton material so you're
not gonna be too hot wearing this in the
summertime and like I said has color and
fun in it which is definitely cool
instead of always wearing just black now
the next thing I got it's kind of
different for me I really don't pick up
stuff like this but I saw this on the
website and wanted to go for it the last
dress I showed you guys when it was in a
size zero XL so this is a jumpsuit guys
and it has kind of like a cape on it I
absolutely love this jumpsuit it is a
little bit big on
but they didn't have size zero Excel
they only had size 1x L so if you if you
do want to pick this up they have it in
2x and 3x and is definitely fabulous so
this one has some it's basically the
jumpsuit has like a cape on it like a
cape on it it's very classy if you have
like somewhere to go even like a hot
date would be so nice with this one I
felt really sophisticated with my kind
of bob haircut and very elegant in it so
I definitely recommend purchasing this
one guys it's very comfortable it has
real pockets in the front it just gives
you that structure look with a little
bit of breath song it was just like
everything for me guys I absolutely
loved so I did get some accessory items
I want to show you guys so first off I
got these really cute white quilted
sneakers now these are super cute guys
these are size 40 I think this is a UK
40 or year 40 which is a US size 9 now
these are like those so popular quilted
white sneakers and I absolutely love
these guys they're super duper cute and
most of all they're fresh AF so I like
wearing sneakers like this sometimes
just because they're cool to slip on
they're easy simple shoes to wear so I
thought these were cute so I picked
these off the website now I am gonna
show you guys some jewelry I still got
from a website called soul fool so I've
also featured this company before
previously so this timer I picked up a
couple jewelry pieces from them so I am
obsessed with name necklaces and you
guys asked me all the time where I get
my name necklaces from so one of my name
necklaces I'm wearing right now is
actually from so full and I also this
one right here is actually from my name
necklace calm so I were named necklace
all the time I just like the patterns
laying them up and stuff like that
so I decided to get this really cute one
that they had on their website now this
one did come in a rose gold color guys
and I'll put it up on the side so you
guys can see it and it just says my
boyfriend's name on it it's really cute
I I think I'm like obsessed with getting
his name on my neck so I just got this
one I thought those was really cute so I
picked this one out it's very petite
I'm not gonna grow gold person and this
rose gold kind of threw me off when I
got it but I was like you know what I'm
just gonna take my chances with this one
a rocket I don't have to always like
wear your gold gold gold and that's kind
of my safe thing to do I like run for
gold all the time so the next two things
that I got are these cool bracelets now
with these bracelets guys you guys can
actually get them engraved with kind of
sayings and quotes and stuff like that
so
some of them actually do come pre
engraved so this one did come pre in
grades and this one says she believes
she could so she did they have like
these really cool empowerment kind of
bracelets and I just want to mention
this even though Mother's Day will be a
day after I post this video up these are
actually great gifts for mother's days
is for mothers Mother's Day as well and
even if you're giving a gift to your
daughter whatever just like these nice
little encouraging right like little
quotes that they put on here very cute
so like I said this one says she
believes she could so she did so I don't
know I'm gonna rock this one a lot
because I think it's really cute and it
does fit over my fat wrists so that's a
good thing too and it's like it's really
simple and cute at the same time guys so
the next one I got it's kind of it's a
rose gold one and it says believe in
yourself and I actually think of am I
mistaken that I engraved this one I
don't call me I think I did believe it I
think I did I'm not sure but maybe I did
it so I thought this was really cute and
you can get engraved this is rose gold
and I don't know just putting these nice
little quotes on are very inspiring like
you know I could put these on during the
day you know if I'm feeling kind of like
bummy I could just look I ain't that
girl believing yourself so the last
thing I got from this company is this
really cool necklace so like I was
saying if you're watching this video
today which is Saturday which is kind of
like a late post tomorrow be Mother's
Day so happy Mother's Day to all the
mothers out there and the future moms
like me so um I'm not pregnant those
guys okay so don't trip up so I got this
cute necklace from my mom and she
promised she's not gonna see this video
till like maybe like a few days later
because she's like slow on the
notification gang so so I got my mom
this really cute necklace and they have
these on the website which are so cute
and if I could get the necklace I'll be
great because the necklace is actually
not coming out which is kind of weird
okay so this necklace was actually an
engraved necklace guys it's very very
pretty now my mom I'm a sister one on
the middle child of three sisters were
three girls so I got my mom this name
necklace that has all three of our
nicknames engraved in it so my nickname
is June is June so Crale
my older sister's nickname is dah doo
and my younger sister's name is Lola and
those are kind of like our Haitian or
Creole kind of nicknames so I got it
engraved on this necklace for my mom so
it's like three
um name necklaces and one necklace so
she's going to love this when she sees
it it's so cute guys and it's like our
little nicknames that she gave us were
growing up so I know she's gonna be like
