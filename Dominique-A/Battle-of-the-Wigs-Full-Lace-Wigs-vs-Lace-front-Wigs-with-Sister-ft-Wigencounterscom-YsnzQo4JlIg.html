gonna be a little bit different so I
will send two units from Wigan counters
comm and I will link the way units down
below for you guys so basically they
sent me a lace front wig and they also
sent me a full lace wig so what I did in
his videos today is put one of the wigs
on my sister and then this wig is the
way that I decide to put on for you guys
so this is a full lace wig it's a bob
style unit I showed you guys how I glued
it down just did like a little baby hair
magic and also did like a nice little
wave into the unit because I want to
kind of give you guys a little bit more
of a jazzy look than a plain boring bob
now if you're someone that's low
maintenance like my sister a lace front
wig will work better for you just
because you don't really have to do too
much to it only has about three inches
of parting space so you just party it
wherever you want in the front and then
just keep it pushing now with the full
lace wig if you're someone that likes to
do like multiple styles meaning duelin
braids stuff like that half-up half-down
looks and stuff like that then this unit
is probably a better unit for you but
what the bob style unit being a full
lace it's kind of like necessary and
unnecessary at the same time if this was
like a 22 inches long unit in those
Foley's and probably even better just
because you can do like really like a
lot of styles with that but guys I will
leave all the information down below if
you're interested in purchasing any of
these units and if you're interested in
seeing how these units turn out guys and
I would like you to stay tuned and keep
on
