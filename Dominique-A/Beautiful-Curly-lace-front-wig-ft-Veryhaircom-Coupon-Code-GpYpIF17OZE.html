another hair review now today's hair
views box you guys by a company called
berry hair calm and I've only seen about
three reviews on YouTube from this
company and I wanted to check out how
their company will see what they got so
I decided to do a review for the company
themselves so basically today I'm going
to be showing you guys a curly unit now
this unit is a virgin indian remy unit
and i haven't done one in a long time so
this here is actually deep wavy texture
and I haven't done a deep wave hair
style in a while either so this is going
to be a to to take today so I'm gonna
try this out today and hopefully this
looks great I'm really excited about the
hair because honestly when I opened the
hair I wasn't expecting it to be this
nice it is really really nice guys and
I'm excited to make this look happen so
I don't know if I'm going to customize
this unit yet but if I do customize it
I'm going to make a separate video on my
customizing on this unit just because
I'm gonna keep you guys in the loop so
that when you guys see me with it you
guys are kind of like what is that unit
you guys know exactly what it is
so this is a unit itself guys it comes
with three combs in the front right here
it comes to two on the side and one in
the middle right here I never use this
comb limit I only use the side columns
there's a lot of party space on this
unit right here you get about three
inches of party space and what they did
do is go ahead and bleach the naturist
are at the tippity front of the of the
wig it does have a really nice natural
hair line and it does have baby hairs
this unit is 24 inches long it's in the
color natural color so this is what it
looks like essentially it is very nice
and big guys I'm really excited about
this because I'm about to rock me some
curly hair this winter and I think it's
nice I'm almost tempted to diet the same
color I have on right now because I feel
like that would look really nice so I'm
not sure what I'm going to do quite yet
with this unit but I'm really excited it
does how adjustable straps in the back
and I'll probably have to use adjustable
straps because my head is a little bit
smaller and it does have a nice stretch
panel on the side right here if you guys
can see the stretch panel so I think
that is great it does have ear to ear
lace I'll probably add an elastic band
just because my head is very very small
guys and I want to make sure that this
lays flat I'm not sure if I'm going to
use the glue on this one this time just
because I don't want to have all that
messy stuff in the front even though
it's easy to take off
I just I switch my wigs up so much and I
do so many reviews that I just don't I
just don't wear units I I switched my
hair up every single day I can wear this
you and I wear this unit for a couple
days now for like four or five days in a
row just because I really like it and
it's beginning I've been getting
positive feedback but I don't keep
hearing for that long I have so many
units that I just everyday whatever my
mood is in the morning I just put it on
like I'm gonna be a blonde today so I'm
going to put my blonde wig on no I'm
going to be a brunette to them and put
this one until I'm just that type of
weirdo so yeah so I'm excited about this
one
it does have good party space and
obviously they bleached it for us I'm
going to cut it off
this is virgin hair so you do have the
ability to go ahead and color it if you
want or dye bleach do whatever you want
with it so I'm gonna weigh my options on
maybe I will maybe I won't we'll see um
so I'll linked on all the information
for this company down below there is a
promotion code guys so go ahead and
check that out down below as well too or
I'll link it somewhere in this video
before after or in the middle um so um
stick uh you can check out that
promotion link for the channel they do
have some very affordable units they
have tried have extensions they have
closures they got ways they got
celebrity style wigs so whatever your
interest is they have it so go ahead and
check them out guys and if you're
interested in the rest of this video and
seeing what this looks like stay tuned
you
Oh
you
this is what the unit looks like I
basically just try to play around with
just mine early what I did notice is
that I'm probably really gonna have to
add an elastic band to this just because
the perimeter of this is like it really
comes ear to ear when they say you're
too ear on these kind of waves will
expect you this one it really comes down
to your ear part right here so I need to
kind of get this down right here I need
to get this side down my hair but it
does have a beautiful beautiful hairline
guys I look at that oh my god but one
thing I was going to say is they over
bleached the boat axle parts a little
bit too much
so therefore what you're probably gonna
have to do with this is just add your
favorite face powder to kind of make it
look a little bit more your skin tone
but this is probably one way that I
would wear this here stock thick it
looks so nice and natural I didn't add
anything to the curls this is how the
curls look just right off the RIP guys I
didn't put anything in it to fuse or
anything but I wonder and I'm pretty
sure that once I do wash and then defuse
it it's going to look gorgeous or even
let it air dry it's gonna be so pretty
but I do like it the baby here seemed
very realistic to me I don't see
anything unrealistic about these baby
hairs um like you can see the oh my god
like look it look at the look at the
hairline guys like look at this like you
have like oh my gosh if I were to use
the doctor be good method and actually
you kind of get this to sit down like
really tightly it would be so good and
the flip over method would actually work
very very well if I actually did it with
that so what I'm going to do is post a
video of how I lay my wigs down and
laying my curly wigs down to make it
look natural so I can show you guys how
I get this to the permanent stay done
and how to do flip over methods and
actually get really really cool nice
realistic looking hairstyles like this
so I really really like this unit guys I
think it's nice I haven't received any
shedding or tangling the tangling part
I'll kind of give that you got to put
some time on that one because curly hair
does tangle a lot and it does um kind of
get matted in the back but that's only I
really feel like that's only the case if
you manipulate the hair a little too
much so I don't plan on doing any
manipulation to this hair like trying to
straighten it out or trying to do all
this crazy stuff because I already have
straight units so why do I need to
straighten this out this is just going
to stay naturally curly and beautiful so
hmm so yes so that's about it for this
room
