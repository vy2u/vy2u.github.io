today and i'm stopping here today to do
a quick product review on products i
used for this here that i haven't right
now and this is the hair from my
previous video this is the beauty by
Aphrodite here and this is the virgin
malaysian curly hair and so far this
hair is an eight plus i absolutely love
this hair guys um and i plan to keep
this in your hair for a length of time
so i can give you guys a full aspect in
the full review of the hair so you guys
can check it out um you can check out my
last two videos my show-and-tell and
then my actual install this will be the
second time the third tell me oh the
second time you guys see any hair on my
head i will do a whole review video a
weekly video when i'll post it up in a
couple days from now showing you guys
talking about the air and the pros and
cons about the hair but right now we're
going to get into products that I've
been using on this here to maintain the
hair and it's beautiful texture first of
all I don't shampoo the hair I just
basically condition the hair and the two
conditioners that I've been using to
condition this hair are very simple
conditioners you can find out like
Walgreens CBS any place up one more
target you go anywhere but I want it was
on sale at CVS I picked it up and it's
aveo5 moisture milks and it's a
moisturizing conditioner with five
essential vitamins and this one is a
passion fruit smoothie um I usually put
this on my hair and I leave it on my
hair as like a mass kind of thing for
about like an hour and it also mix it
with the John free the john frieda
frizz-ease um smooth start come from
repair and conditioner so I use this as
well as you can top and use it so I use
this I'm actually do two separate
section so I sitting here in half and I
put a 1 square of this and 1 squared of
the real fine way in and use one side
then I spread it again and scratch aveo5
again and do another chump cuz this hair
has a lot of volume as you guys can tell
so you got to do the hair and portions
so that you can actually get the hair to
actually condition very well and so far
so good the hair condition absolutely
great after I condition I feel like they
it has
more life to it they had has more
texture it's very soft know when I wash
my hair I usually use one of my wife two
poems about to find it one second guys
okay so i usually use my wife tube well
i took long liner from sallys and i just
wept it first before i even conditioning
here i went all the hero and i usually
comb it out i get minimal shedding but
shedding I don't get shedding like right
now I won't get shedding when the hair
is dry it already in place I won't get
shut it when it comes to like detangle
in here I'll get your hair which is kind
of normal as nothing it is no I'm not
going to say kind of normal it's normal
for curly hair so when it comes time for
me to detangle the year before I co-wash
I co washing and do all that kind of
treatment to it it does you do get kind
of hearing off of a detailer because
detangle and curlier is like it's like a
big deal you know you don't want to do
the hair matted up before you wet it
because then it gets really hard to get
it out but this year I'm surprisingly is
very manageable and with the wide tooth
comb like this i'm able to get in here
the tangles out of the hair which is
really really good so what I like i said
what i do first if i split and a half i
detangled in here and i close one
section off of the rubber with an
elastic band and I wet the first side
first and then I'll apply the John
freitas conditioner mixed with aveo5
conditioner with mom you know massage
decided my hair within then I'll wrap
this up and then I'll do the next side
the same routine goes and i'll leave it
here conditioning on for about like an
hour or if i take a nap little Barbie
longer than that but it'll still be
really moist and then I'll go in and I
will actually um I'll go in and I
actually wash it out and after I watch
it all I let the hair air dry and when I
mean air dry let it air dry well I let
it you're definitely find is still kind
of like soaps up just a little the next
product that I use is my beautiful is
the beautiful textures moisture butter
and it's a whipped cream whipped curl
cream and I like this product a lot I
did watch reviews on this and I've been
checking ratings online and stuff like
that this product is really good the
hair has the others have like a drive up
but there has a soft up look after you
airdrie you know you need to pull over
and watch on
just to give it here a little bit of
life and this is like a whipped
consistency I'll show you guys exactly
what it looks like so this is like a
whipped consistency it's like really
whipped and nice and as you can see I
use like a little bit i don't really use
that a lot I just get like a little bit
in my hands and I'll put it like on the
the bang side kind of like the the front
side right here or I'll put it like on
the parts i layered in the front and
I'll kind of do that ends I'll work my
way around it I'm the thing like the
thing about this on whipped cream cream
curl cream is that it does make the hair
um it doesn't make it like like a gel
but it kind of gives them here like a
stiff not stiff but like gives shape and
it like sucks to hear up and shapes it
up which I like in the front of my hair
but all around my hair I I prefer not I
actually like the way the hair looks
like this because it has like a lot of
body and um it has a lot of character to
it I don't really like in my hair is all
like things like perfect like I don't
want it to be too perfect because it's
curly hair I went there and have a
little bit of character all around so I
just used this on the ends of my hair
and then just the front part to define
the curls a little bit more towards to
frame my face right here and that's it
so um this is really good this was on
sale Sally's i got it for it was
actually originally 589 it was two
dollars off so when you do the math like
318 r plus tax almost four hours so this
is a really good product goes to try
this out this is probably the only one I
would use to have a custard and I'm not
really I don't like the consistency of
it it's too like thick kind of and this
is very light I can also i usually also
mix this in my water bottle with my
spray bottle with a little bit of this
and what I shake it up a nice family
here other than that I usually just use
water and like I said I like the hair to
have a little bit of body so I'll spray
I'll spray the back part and the sides
with water just to UM keep the hair
comfortably nice and soft like the waves
on the hair is really the curls on this
hair is really nice soft and beautiful
and I want to maintain that I will only
use this product on my end just to give
my ends of
bit of a defined curl and that's about
it so I'm really not using that many
products on the hair just conditioning
it and I do use my beautiful textures of
whipped cream on this just on some parts
and that's in and it's just your
classical h2o so I know this is a really
simple video and I know you guys know
what to do what to use on curling hair
but this for this type of curly hair i
only use minimal products you only need
minimal products really there or yet
again you probably don't even need
products i'm just being extra but this
here is really good guys so far so good
i will keep you guys updated and this is
the first product review and we'll see
what happens when I with this here after
all right I think I'm going to dive in
here so we'll see what happens after I
died in here if it kind of loses a
pattern or if it gets dry and will
therefore from that point on what decide
what to do with thereafter will decide
what products I shouldn't used to revise
the hair if that happens but thank guys
