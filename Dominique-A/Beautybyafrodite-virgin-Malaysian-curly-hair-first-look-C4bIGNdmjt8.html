first look of the install um I did tell
you guys I was gonna install this and
show you guys the lace closure
installing all that jazz but I was being
lazy yesterday so I got one of my
friends to do it for me and she did an
amazing job as you guys can tell I'm
lace closure is down I did do the
elastic bein method on this closure but
then she just sewed it down towards the
back so I was being lazy guys and yes
I'm in it but look at the results um
like I said this hair was sent to me by
a company called Beauty buy half a day
she contacts me through my youtube
channel
I went I then went and I checked out her
Instagram because she only has she
doesn't have an online website put up
yet she only has it on Instagram so I
went on Instagram and checked it out and
her Instagram name is beauty by Alfred
day and she had a whole selection of
hair and she told me I could choose
whatever I wanted so therefore I always
do body waver straight hair so I decided
to pick curly pattern here and I picked
the curly the wretched Malaysian curly
hair so this is the first time of me
having curly Malaysian hair and I
absolutely love it guys she sent me a 16
inch closure an 18 inch 20 inch and 22
inch bundle of hair and I just show you
guys this in my last video but I'll show
it to you guys again and you can also
contact her at beauty by Aphrodite
gmail.com and this is she lists the
contents that I got up there so like I
said before I got almost I got three
bundles of ear and a closure so it was
really nice of her to send me this here
and as promised I had to do a review on
it I didn't initial show-and-tell
yesterday and I'm doing the actual look
of the hair for now for you guys to see
this is really nice hair the curl
pattern is very whimsical and cute I you
guys leave you know this is just
different for me I always have straight
hair or some type of like curl like
straight hair or crimped hair or
something like that I never have curly
hair and this is the first time that I
had curling hair and this curly hair is
amazing I love this hair it's so pretty
I've only won it for about two days now
but
doesn't matter for the first two days I
give this here a 10 out of 10 I haven't
received any shedding I've get I've been
getting a little bit of tingling towards
the ends but this is curly hair so when
you're when you're buying curling hair
expected hair to have just a little bit
of tangle but it's not tangling in the
nape area it's not tangling any any
major like noticeable ears like down
here anything like that it's only
tangling like maybe at the ends just a
little bit but what I do for that I want
to just spray it with a little bit of
water and I use a big wide tooth comb
and I just like Nick it out a little bit
so after that it's fine so I installed
the 20 inch bundle the 22 inch bundle
and I did install partial like maybe
like you know 95% of the 18 inch bundle
and I only had like this much air which
will be the 5% of hair left so that's
actually really good my girlfriend um
did it for me and she does a freaking
heck of a good job if you're ever in the
east coast on the Connecticut area
holler at me and I'll get my girlfriend
to do every does colors cut Styles
leaves and everything like she's like
really really good so if you're in
Connecticut or on the east coast and you
need someone to do your hair that can do
a really really good job she does a
really good job when it comes to sew ins
that's why I usually let her do my
sewing's if I'm doing like a u-part wig
or something like really easy I'll do
that by myself but for someone's I'm too
lazy to do that on myself so I get my
girlfriend she doing and she's excellent
I'll show you guys what the length looks
like 22 inch comes with like past my
breastesses
it comes like a little down towards my
bellybutton not too too it's not too too
long but it comes pretty long down
towards my bellybutton but it's
definitely past my boobs the 20 inch
like probably touches my little lower
than my boobs a little bit and then 18
inches 16 inch I kind of hyped up there
but um it's truly here so it kind of has
a bit shrinkage but I'm pretty sure once
I straighten it out I'll have like this
but it will be really really long but
who says I'm going to straighten this
because I don't even think I'm gonna do
that
I'm just organized I might straighten it
or I might straighten a piece of this to
show you guys what it looks like
maybe not straighten half of this
show you guys what it looks like after
it's straightened but I like this and I
don't want to change it because it's so
pretty
um I know a lot of people say that curly
hair is like a summer look curly hair
can definitely be a winter look as well
dry curls are really nice for the
wintertime so that might be my winter
look I'm not sure yet guys but it might
just be and like I said guys this is
hair I feel like this hair is really
versatile this hair can just be anything
you can wear in a ponytail you could do
like cute like you know bring it to the
side bring it over here look anything
like that but I just like it like this
for now cuz it frames my face and it
makes it it just looks so pretty the
closure is pretty good as why I did
pluck and tweeze the closure just a
little bit and I did put a little bit
makeup on it I feel like it looks
realistic enough for me
oh it looks realistic I feel like it
looks realistic so you guys tell me what
you guys think about the closure I did
pluck it and I did add a little bit of
concealer and foundation the concealer I
use for this is the Maybelline fit me
fun concealer and number 30 which is the
darkest color I use that and I use a
little bit of the Ben diam topaz powder
on this one just to kind of lighten it
up or set it off to be really pretty um
as far as haircare I just get my spray
bottle with some water in it and I just
spray the hair up I didn't spray the
complete here I'm spray the closure up a
little bit just um you know just to make
the front define more and just sprayed
it with a little bit of water and I
don't touch the hair when I co wash the
hair I didn't go running my hands
through the hair playing with the hair I
let the hair just dry up by itself and
did not put my hands on it after because
that's how you make the hair frizz out
and stuff like that I want the purse to
be more defined so I just left the hair
like that and I just let it air dry for
nighttime care I'm last night what I did
was I just pulling her back until I had
a little bun I rolled I twisted the hair
in a bun and I just pulled held like
this and put my silk bonnet on it on top
of it and I did tie the front and down
with my regular old silk headscarf I
fold it in half like a bandana and then
just put it on like that and then it was
a wrap my head's kind of really tight
right now so I'm kind of like figuring
this out so it's a bit tight up here um
but other than that cause you guys could
tell it's looking fabulous but I'll show
you guys something here looks like from
the sides and then I'll show you guys
what it looks like from the back so this
is a stab right here
very realistic closure like I said and
the hair texture from the closure
matches the hair texture from the back I
did Co watching here as I told you guys
before but this is what it looks like
after Ecco after Co watching here this
is a curl pattern that the hair habits
so it's like amazing and that's why I
don't want to straighten it because I
want to lose this Barbie not Barbie this
like Cabbage Patch girl that's what I
call it so I want to keep it like this
so this would all say from the sides and
then from the back and it's pretty long
guys so then here is long so this little
guy looks like from the back and then
you got your side right hand so this is
a side view right here and then this is
just back to the front and the closure
does hi baby here's in the front I just
pull them out it's like a baby here in
here so you know if you're a baby girl
baby baby girl if you're a baby here
we're like me just I just play with them
down a little bit and just not make it
look too crazy but guys this is it this
