it's going to be a different video in
today's video I'm going to talk to you
guys about weight loss and I'm also
going to show you guys a product that
I'll be using when I would continue my
weight loss right now and things that
I've used in the past to help aid me in
my weight loss so if you're interested
in this video stay tuned and keep on
watching right guys so I'm not going to
make this video kind of one of those
long extended videos when I talk too
much so I'm just gonna get straight to
the facts of why I feel the way I feel
about myself and what I tried many times
in my life to change it so basically
I've been always been overweight and
I've always suffered with like eating
disorders and stuff like that I've been
in a wreck suit before I've never been
believing because I could never bring
myself to the point of actually sticking
something in my mouth and vomiting but I
have starved myself several times to
lose weight and I was successful one
time when I was a little bit younger
when you're younger you're trying to
lose weight a little bit easier just
because your metabolism is just all over
the place so your eat it's easier for
you just to drop weight and you really
haven't become a woman yet at that time
so you really haven't had a defined body
fat or defined body shape yet now that I
am turning 25 that I'm already in my mid
adulthood I have basically stopped my
growth right now so therefore this is
what this this is how tall I'm going to
be and this is just all the parts of my
body that I'm going to have unless I get
enhancements which I did with my breast
implants so therefore when I was younger
I did in high school I was like very big
I was like 200 pounds for 1314 year old
that was just about the size that I was
before I could lost weight now and I
don't know I remember it's freshman year
and that summer I made a vow that I was
going to lose weight so I came back
sophomore year and I was like 35 pounds
less than when I was during sturm
freshman year and any freshman year and
then at sophomore year proceeded on I
kept losing weigh kept losing weight
losing weight and junior I just kept
losing weight losing losing weight
losing weight so I went from being 200
pounds to 138 pounds now going from an
extreme 200 pounds to 138 pounds I was
skinny like I was so so so so skinny and
in my head I wasn't it wasn't clicking
in my head that like yo you're starving
yourself dude like you're like like I
was so freaking and I
was like telling myself I'm not hungry
I'm not hungry I remember I used to use
the ramen noodle packs I used to come
with a little um seasoning powder I used
to actually boil hot water and just pour
the powder in it and that would be my
dinner like I used to do extreme things
just to lose weight and in my head like
now that I'm older I'm kind of rethink
about it like you know what the was
I doing like I was trying so hard to be
skinny and it's not like I was trying to
track guys gonna do that because at that
age I didn't really care about guys I
was just worried about school and my
friends and hanging out and stuff like
that so I don't know where I was getting
this kind of like push to lose weight I
think I was just so caught up in the
image of being beautiful and looking
skinny because back then um growing up
I'm 25 now they didn't really talk they
I mean they didn't really have like they
didn't make being plus-size like
plus-size modeling and stuff like that
something that was popular things like
that were kind of like embarrassing like
being a fat model or being like anything
overweight so I just was so used to
seeing skinny models and skinny girls
and this and that and it's just kind of
nauseating because like you were
repeatedly seeing all this
all the time you're just kind of like yo
what the hell and I'm like sitting here
like 200 pounds at 13 years old looking
at myself like yo what the hell like so
I really tried hard that summer to lose
weight and ever since I lost that weigh
in high school I've been kind of like
maintaining it and then eventually I
kind of trick her back to my 200 pounds
so last August 14 I was about 218 pounds
and for me for some reason I'm really
confident myself like other than weight
loss weight is just something that is
just always going to be a triggering a
woman's mind that's just something I
always deal with so I was really
confident though cuz you know I was
always doing my hair I would tie my
makeup done I was really shocked to like
drop by nice clothes dress myself up got
my nails done and did everything that I
had to to be beautiful because I still
feel beautiful it was just that the
weight was kind of becoming a burden
because when I went to stores to buy
clothes I wasn't being ate I wasn't able
to fit most of the clothes like I would
buy pants and my pants at that point
we're almost at size 17 I was wearing
about like a 15 16 it was kind of
getting snug so I'm like what the hell
and I will tell you guys in five four
and a half inches so that's like a my
BMI is like extremely morbidly obese at
that point so I'm just kind of like okay
um Dom you gotta like you got to figure
this out so after seeing a Beyonce
concert weeks later I was like okay Dom
maybe today's a day so I went to Weight
Watchers in my local town and I signed
up for Weight Watchers so in the
beginning I'm thinking like your weight
wiped is gonna be nothing like I'm it's
just not gonna work I'm just
gonna still be fat like blah blah blah
but I'm gonna tell you guys right now
this video is not sponsored by Weight
Watchers or I'm not like endorse or blah
blah blah anything like that from Weight
Watchers I'm gonna tell you guys right
now it works
I lost 33 pounds off of Weight Watchers
in this light at the span of August till
about April so I don't know how many
months that is I'll put it somewhere in
here so you guys know because encounter
your fingers so I lost 33 pounds from
that point on the only reason why I
stopped is because at that point I was
well on vacation I felt like I could
maintain it by myself so I was um kind
of following the same regimen and then
when I went went to LA last year and I
went to like Philly I went to all these
places on vacation so of course when I
go on vacation I'm not gonna sit there
and try to pick nitpick through the
foods that I want so I couldn't enjoy it
a little bit of food just you know
courtesy just eating a little bit more
than I usually ate and things that I
wasn't eating when I was on Weight
Watchers so of course I gained like 6
pounds or so and I also got a breast
augmentation so therefore these put on a
little bit of weight on me as well so um
yeah but these are things that I
understood and that I was able to work
through so what I decided to do now
since the winter seasons are in and
usually we cover up in the winter and
start Weight Watchers again so I have
Center for Weight Watchers again and I'm
trying to do this play waitress thing
again I have no problem with my weight
right now I really like my body right
now after the breast augmentation the
weight loss I was trying to consider
getting liposuction or something like
that but I probably probably like wait
for that and I know people are gonna be
like girl you don't need all that listen
I'm gonna get it if I want to
get it so it is what it is so at least
I'm telling you guys the truth but I was
considering getting like maybe like
weight liposuction or maybe I was even
considering a tummy tuck because I do
have access skin on my abdomen region so
I thought that
be better for me to get a tummy tuck the
thing about the tummy tuck though is I'm
a little bit um like kind of scared
about it because I don't know if I'm
gonna have too much scar tissue
underneath my abdomen so when I get
pregnant and if I do have to have a
c-section
it just becomes a problem because I have
to get on the c-section I have to get
cut down there and scar tissue can get
in the way during the procedure so just
want to make sure that I'm okay with
that I'm not saying I'm gonna get a
liposuction but I'm just saying that it
was one thought that was on my mind but
like I said if I want to get it I'm
gonna get it regardless on what anybody
has to say so yeah so now I'm to Weight
Watchers has decided to start this thin
tea routine and I've noticed that a lot
of people on YouTube ever review thin
tea and I got two packs I got the 28-day
detox plan and I also got the 28-day
fat-burner blend so what I'm assuming
that I'm going to do is split these up
and I'm going to do 52 days of diabetes
so what I was thinking that I'll
probably do is do um like the fat burner
one day then to do the detox the next
day together these two should last me 52
days and if I continue doing this with
the Weight Watchers in a balanced diet
and exercise that I should probably lose
a good 20 pounds which is my goal weight
now so I'm crossing my fingers I could
lose 20 pounds within apatow April or
whatever it is they did send me this
cool little tea sifter thing in here I
was using 4x4 gauze pads to do it just
because when I was at work I need to sit
my I need to actually do the tea bag so
I had nothing so I used on 4x4 gauze to
do it but this is cute they sent me this
cute one in the pink it's pink and you
could just put the actual um tea
sprinkles in here and then play it in
your hot cup of water so yeah um there's
instructions on the back of these that
tell you exactly what to do you're going
to do one teaspoon of the loose leaf
detox plan and you're going to let it
you're going to let it sit in boiling
water for three to five minutes and then
you'll remove the strainer and drink it
I usually do not put sugar or honey or
anything on these if I do want a little
bit of sugar I use sugar substitute I
just um just feel like it's zero
calories and I just don't really like
with sugar you really have to keep
adding scoops and adding scoops and I
knew scoops I ain't got time for that so
I'm just going to use a sugar substitute
which is just the same thing and it
gets the job done these do time these
deities do tend to have kind of like a
weary taste like a awkward taste but if
you want to put some some additives in
it you can put additives in it if you
want to it's not gonna it's not going to
affect the effectiveness of the tea
itself so like I said I'll probably
transition on these uh probably do one
of the fat burners one day and then one
of the 28 detox the next day just to
give myself some balance and when I was
on Weight Watchers I was going to the
gym two to three times a week now that
I'm working I'm doing home care more so
now that I'm doing pediatrics I do do my
work home care kind of longer shifts so
it's um it's a bit like time
constricting so I do have to work my
schedule around now about my work
schedule with my gym schedule so
hopefully it works out for me in the end
I have high hopes on this weight loss
training again because like I said to
you guys when I was doing my way watches
before I lost 33 pounds and I've been
able to somewhat maintain it but I'm
doing this now and I'm redoing Weight
Watchers and using thin tea just to kind
of give myself the extra boost and I
hope that this works and I'm really
excited for the future I will update you
guys with the tea and my weight loss so
if you're interested in that too stay
tuned and keep on watching my videos
guys I know this video seems so long but
it's a very informative video and it's
way it's about weight and a lot of
people struggle with weight I strive
struggle weight my whole entire life and
right now in my life I feel like I'm
able to get my life together when it
comes to weight and I thought I would
