today and I'm stopping my to do a review
on the bentonite powder and the powder
that I purchased was the Topaz color and
this is a 1.4 ounce bottle full
container and I bought this from Amazon
for about six bucks four dollars
shipping and it came in two to three
days I ordered it Monday night and
received it Thursday early morning so
I'm really excited about this I really
like this powder what the powder used to
use before was really really light and I
look like ghostly but it's okay because
I stepped my cookies up and I bought
something better so the one I used to
use before was this Maybelline shine
free loose powder and I was just using
this as a highlight and I'm really early
in the t-zone area so when it says shine
free I got so excited like oh my god
this is like the best thing ever but the
mistake I made was that it was way too
late because Maybelline they only do it
to a certain extent of a collar like
0.03 and there's like no darker shade
but that is why it's just it's a
translucent powder but whatever so I
ordered this bentonite powder because
I've seen a lot of people doing reviews
on it and I was like man I should get
this because you know my my face is not
looking as spectacular as I want it to
look so I'm gonna get this now I'm just
joking guys but um I only got it because
I wanted to try something new out and I
know that my face was looking a bit
lighter before so I'm trying to you know
improve by buying more products that
suit dark-skinned women or women of
darker color whatever you want to call
it so I decided to try this out just as
a tester so I got it and I loved it so
I'm going to show you guys today that I
did put it on and if you guys can see it
it doesn't look that bad well it doesn't
look bad actually looks good compared to
the one that it was to him before it
blends really well and it kind of like
just looks like my skin like it doesn't
look like I'm wearing this dusty dusty
done I don't have like a dusty face and
I even took pictures with flash and the
flash came out looking good so I'm like
okay this is good they did have the
banana version and I know a lot of
people who buy the banana
but if I'm gonna try to improve I'm not
gonna go back to buying light color
because I am NOT light skinned I'm a
cocoa chocolate looking girl so I'm like
you know this one is actually better and
it has like kind of like these light
orange undertones that um kind of make
your skin look a little bit more
luminous and pretty and I try to like
show you guys that a good lighting so
you guys can see it from the light
outside how it looks it doesn't look
dust yet on and actually looks like it
blends with my face and what I do is add
bronzer underneath it to kind of
brighten it out even more to make it
look more natural and pretty so I love
this product I love this this is really
really good and for six bucks I mean you
can't even beat that and I mean it's
that's really good price cuz even the
one that I bought from Walmart was
almost six hours five something so even
if I'm paying four extra dollars for
shipping I don't care cuz this is worth
it I'll show you guys what it looks like
um like I know like a little brush and
this is how pigmented it looks it's like
really really nice I mean it kind of
comes off looking kind of orange but
when you put it on it like kind of seeps
into your skin so that it kind of like
blends with your own skin which is like
really good so I really like that
product I mean for a lot of people using
the banana powders where women are a bit
light skinned looking I mean that looks
better for them as a highlight but for
me I used taupe as their sienna and
there's like a bunch of other names but
I prefer this one better because this
one just looks nice on my skin to each
his own so everybody to go out and you
can go out and look further powders they
have a whole collection of colors and
figure out what best suits you but what
best suits me is a topaz color when I
open it I kind of thought like oh my god
this is like really like orange looking
but once you put it on your skin you
realize that it's not that bad of a
color it actually looks way better than
that dusty stuff and I'm saying this
coming from me because I was using that
dusty stuff before myself so therefore
I'm actually you know improving which is
a good thing if you watch the video
before a couple makeup videos before I
did a foundation and concealer video
you'll see what I'm talking about
I was looking really dusty there and the
real test is if you take a picture with
flash and you look at the flash you can
see whether you look ghostly down here
and now and when I took a flash picture
with this I wasn't looking all ghostly
down there so that I was like okay this
is actually pretty good and you know I
picked the right color that's that's
what it's all about it's like picking
the color that best suits you and that
will flatter you and I believe that I
picked the best when that flatters me
and I go say I'm trying to show you guys
the natural lighting outside I'm trying
to show you guys a natural light from
outside on my skin to show you guys what
it looks like and I think it looks
pretty pretty good so that's what I
wanted to do just cut mine and show you
guys the product that I purchase I'm
really proud of myself for buying
something different this time and I did
jump on the bandwagon but that's fine
you know that's how you learn and I'm
learning off of YouTube which is the
best thing that could ever happen to me
so just leave your comments down below
and yes I mean you guys gonna ask me
whether this is still the hair yes this
is the hair and it's still looking
