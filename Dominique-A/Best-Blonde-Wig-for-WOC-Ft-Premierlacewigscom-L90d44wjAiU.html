another big Wednesday video so in
today's video we'll be showing you guys
a unit from Premier League Swisscom now
this is the celebrity inspired unit and
it is a blonde on breed unit like this
one
now I've reviewed wigs from them before
but I was never partnered with them or
working with them until now so this unit
that I have on here I will leave the
link down below for this unit I actually
showed you guys how I custom colored in
and everything to this kind of like ash
blonde look so this unit today I did the
same exact thing to it but I use well in
charms 218 and I will link that down
below for you guys so you guys don't
have to worry about that now this is a
bob style unit and you know Bob's are
like popping for the season so I wanted
to do one that was ombre blonde this
time just because I'm going to give my
woman of color some variation when it
comes to wearing hair colored here
especially so this one I did ombre the
same way so I basically achieve the same
Cod that I have on now guys you'll see
some parts in the front that are a
little bit more blonder than the back
and it's not too ashy but it goes really
well and it blends very nice which I
really really like now this is a really
nice cut it's really short in the back
and then you get like a lot of length in
the front I part of the desert as a side
part just because I wanted to give
myself like a little bit of a bang in
the front this is a lace front and it
comes with three combs in the front one
at the base and two on the sides as was
an elastic band at the back oil nut
elastic and an adjustable shop at the
back I did add an elastic band for extra
security show that it's really tight on
my head so the wig did not come in this
style I just went in and I just added
some soft curls with my curling wand
just to give it a little bit of a wave
and that's about it so I'll show you
that what this looks like and if you're
interested in see
then I want you to this is it this is it
like I say this all the time but like
sometimes I'll make like wig reviews
into me to be like kind of like a mess
or kind of like a hit but this unit is
so fnq like let you guys see how pretty
this is
and even the color is not so much of a
distracting ass color where you see you
see a girl color welcome to you like
this your hair is way too blond we know
that bitch I know my hair is not blond
but I'm able to pull this off very well
let me show you guys what the back looks
like
so that is what the back looks like guys
look at the look at this look at this
cut now I did mention to you guys before
that the front of the hair looks a
little bit more blonde versus the back
and the back is like kind of more ash
tall but for some reason I don't know
why but I really like it that way
because it doesn't it kind of looks like
you made a mistake but the mistake turn
into a good mistake so it just just I
don't know it just brings a little bit
more brightness to the front and then
kind of dulls out in the back which
makes it look more kind of like a
strawberry blonde in the back and then
kind of like a more subtle a sheer tone
blonde in the front so the back looks
more strawberry blonde and the front
looks more just blonde but tone blonde
now I wear blonde units like I
frequently do like every single single
summer this is going to be one of my
summer blonde units I think it looks
realistic ly nice I did put some press
powder at the parting space and just
kind of like I didn't do a baby hair
magic with it I just kind of like baby
hear it or whatever because if I go like
this you'll still see a lot of that
hairline in the front and I do have a
lot of baby here it's hidden down here
so if I wanted to I can go here and just
kind of play with it some more but I
just kind of like it when it's kind of
like a cascading curl in the front just
kind of makes it look more lively and
not too much put together I did do a
video on how I curl on my hair so I link
that down below for you guys I'll insert
it somewhere I'll be here so you can see
that this is very simple it's kind of
one of those messy styles instead of
just being perfectly straight so I
really like it

later one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
