another hair of you now this interview
is going to be brought to you guys by a
company called RPG RPG here I keep I
keep wanting to say RPG show but it's
not so this is from RPG here calm and I
would sense a unit from them and this is
electron unit now I'm reading it off the
info sheet that I got so this unit I'm
showing you guys is a loose wave engine
revving here in the Google play's front
wigs it's a loose leaf texture on hair
colors natural color and it's 18 inches
long and it is 130 percent density so I
didn't get this one longest time because
I didn't want to do like a long long
wavy wake just because sometimes when
it's longer the hair tends to be a
little bit thinner so I want to keep it
like a 18 inch just to see if I'm going
to be decent enough now this hair
company has I've seen a lot of reviews
on this on the Terra company so I
decided that a let me try it out and
I've been into these wake reviews lately
because it's just been easier just to do
wigs and put them on this is a custom
unit that I made and I will link down
the video for this hair down below I
absolutely love this wig and it is so so
flawless so yes I will link that down
below and I'll respect to the can be
linked down below as well the weight is
very nice guys like I said it has like
this nice soft Swiss lace there are
three combs at the top that's two on the
sides and one here at the base of the
head and also has a comb in the back
with adjustable straps they do leave
like a little bit of lace in the back of
the wig for you so if you want to do
like high ponytail and stuff which I
never do so I never used effort but I
really like this it does have some good
parting space I'm not going to bleacher
any toys that have got like three into
supporting space I'm not going to bleach
it or anything I'm going to leave it
like that I'm probably action pressed
powder what I am going to do with this
one is I'm going to use the got to be
glue method to do glue this down I'm
going to try to wear this for a couple
of days to see how it works and how it
looks it is a little bit short so what
I'm pregnant is just wet it up in this
kind of line an air dryer or diffuser
just to keep the curls nice and bounce
it 730 percent density I don't know what
do you guys think I think it's close
enough to hundred thirty percent density
and you can see the end
very pretty the hair is actually really
nice guys look at that texture it's
really really nice it's like a nice
loose wavy texture which I was really
going for so yeah so I'm excited about
this if you guys are interested to see
what this looks like I want you to stay
tuned and keep online de piqi na na ki

day one thing I got younger girl see me
boy fall for my sky once inside job and
showing us up
he's I see the professional I've been
pumping I'm locked in love like tweaking
strong together he got a strong desire
up to the morning Arthur Young she's
moving up
maybe multiverse so I'm finally done
with the unit I've actually cut the
lates all that kind of stuff and I do
guys saw in the previous clips I was
trying to use the got to be blue method
to kind of get the lights to lay down
I've always run into problems when it
comes to the air tabs the air tabs are
really hard to get down I don't know why
that's the problem and when it comes
back to tying the lace down more like a
headscarf after you finished applying it
it like doesn't even set out so you
really constantly have to stick your
hands like right here and go like this
to get the air to us to stay but I
really like this here guys I think it
looks good I had to go in and kind of
pluck some here at the parting cuz
there's a little too weird looking this
is what the sides look like I kind of
got this side to lay down pretty good I
hope this looks good enough for you guys
I would add some more about dr.
beautiful John on the baby here to kind
of get them to lay down I use my flat my
curling iron to try to press this part
down and kind of press this part up this
way so I can get like a nice sleek kind
of like side part over here if you guys
can tell I wet to here and then I use a
little bit of styling products I use the
canned tuna shea butter for natural hair
leave in conditioner cream this is one
of my favorite creams or leave-in
conditioner to use on curly wigs I just
think that this looks really good and
works really good on the curly hair it
actually um has the curls pop a little
bit and it keeps the style really nice
and then I went in with my diffuser and
I just diffuse the hair to actually get
it to look a little bit better and
define the curls more so this works well
along with the can - what I used to do
is I wet the hair first and then add the
Cantu products on the hair to get it to
look great
sorry guys is the light is coming in and
I apologize for that but yes so this is
how I got the hair to look like this the
hair is about 20 18 inches so substrate
above the boob it's not too too long but
I argue like this because it's just
simple you can wear it in like a
ponytail I probably won't wear a
ponytail I just don't like I'm just not
a ponytail person and I have trouble
with the side so I would kind of try to
find a way to
pilot side so that doesn't look too well
that actually doesn't look too bad
well yeah that actually doesn't look bad
at all guys so I might just get away I
like such a long job also like you can
never really see the thing but from what
I try to the side you can see really
good the necklace my chin is
like super too long but I think this is
cute guys I think this is a good way
it's a very simple way in a very
inexpensive I will link down everything
down below for you guys I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I try to give you
some dimensions in this video by showing
you guys how I put the weight down and
stuff like that I really like this hair
a lot I'm very pleased I do receive it a
little bit of shedding with the hair
matches it because when you cut the
width I think it cut a little close to
the hairline so some of the hair came
out but other than that I'm running my
hands through it not getting any
shedding so that's a plus plus make sure
you leave all your comments down below
also make sure you thumbs up this video
as use and also subscribe if you haven't
and I would catch you guys later
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
