a quick quick quick review on my head
and basically I'm gonna talk to you guys
about the new hair that I have and what
I like about it and what I don't really
like about it so the hair that I have is
hair from China from vacillating comp
and this hair is Chinese virgin hair the
closure I will leave a link down below
and the hair on the bottom is what I'm
gonna talk about so this here is weft in
here and this is Chinese virgin here and
I have inches 20 out of 20 inches 24
inches and a link to a bit of 18 inches
I paid oh look at the ears tangling guys
okay I paid about 230 for the hair 24
inches 120 inches was 285 and 18-inch
was about $65 um I have brought hair
from this place before and I did a
review earlier in the year before maybe
a year or two ago I bought a wig that I
bought what that was SWE OAB too and
that was um Indian remedy plate and I
showed you guys how I like that hair it
was good I still have that wig it's a
bit limp right now but I mean I'll never
wear that again right now but I wanted
to try something new and affordable and
because I am on a budget so I decided to
buy this hair I did see two other people
I bought this here and they said it'd
suck this stuff but I still wanted to
give it a chance sorry I bought it
anyways one of the problems I have with
this hair is a shedding normally you
know honestly every hair sheds
I wish the companies would just come out
and say that the hair is gonna shed
instead of lying about the product but
you know what the shedding that I get
with this hair is not it's it's not like
I can't handle it's manageable
it's not unmanageable it's really
manageable I did still the wefts and the
still sheds but what I realized is when
I straighten the hair the hair sheds
less than it is in the natural state
when the hair is way
it's a natural body wave kind of texture
the hair sheds even more so that's
something I kind of learned and that's
why I prefer wearing my hair straighten
and then put in curls cuz I don't know I
just like the way it looks anyways as
you can tell and it just better and it's
less work for me because I don't want to
deal with all that shedding so but like
I said it is manageable I mean if you
hold the hair from here and then comb it
out like that you'll reduce most of the
shedding and I'm pretty sure that most
people that wear extensions know that so
if you're gonna comb my hair you might
want to hold it from this part and then
brush it down that way to prevent from
snatching the hair off the actual web
with that I mean there's different ways
to prevent shedding but like I said no
matter how many hair companies will tell
you that the hair does not shed honestly
speaking all the hair sheds so we have
to keep that into consideration when
we're shopping online for weed but
tangling it tingles alone as you can see
I just pull the tangle through like
right here I'm back with tangling
problem right here but tell you that
it's not unbearable like I can slide my
hands through with no problem sometimes
well you will get kind of kind of little
ring hair like a bit of kinks in there
but like I said for me it's okay cuz
it's not like I spent like frickin four
or five hundred dollars on three bundles
of hair I only spent about two hundred
bucks on the hair so this is to be
expected but the hair is still good the
hair is actually still good it does
tangle slightly and it does shed but you
know those things from me is manageable
it's it's whatever works for you some of
the good things I love the hair's
natural luster and shine the hair is
Chinese virgin here so it has like kind
of resembles African American hair in my
opinion and I love how thick it it's
just thick and rich so it doesn't look
all weak and Limp and even if the hair
sheds the weft of the hair is so thick
you get so much they pack so much hair
on that little little wrap that you'll
never get one of those bald West I know
I haven't even seen one piece of a bald
well on my
and the hair is so thick like it's
unbelievably thinking I'm making all
these ugly face expressions just so I
can tell you guys how thick this hair
that's another thing that I like about I
love the luster it looks so beautiful
and shiny you don't have to add all that
extra thing that extra gloss to it and
what I realize is if you do add extra
gloss to here eat some gloss like that
that's how thick this hair is it just
eats the gloss just like that but you
don't need all that extra stuff because
the hair is already like it already has
all that extra earth so that's a good
part um
I'll select the affordability and the
shipping the shipping it took three days
for the hair to come in literally three
days to for it to come in best least
wigs come they don't lie about stuff
like that fast shipping three days this
BAM you order it Monday night you get
the hair took Thursday morning just fast
so that's a good thing about the hair I
really I really appreciate their
customer service if you do message them
and tell them something's wrong they
will email you like that so the lady
she's really nice and I appreciate her
patience with us and she delivers the
hair it's not like she's sending you
things and if she does mess it up she
will send you something back so I
appreciate that about her to some big
ups to you and also the affordability
it's really affordable if you're on a
budget you don't have that much money
and you wanted to achieve a nice look
but you want to do it and still be in
the strengths of spending too much money
this is the place to buy the hair and
I've seen thousands of reviews that can
actually agree with what I'm saying and
I can agree with them this place is good
so that's it
so I guess I could tell you guys want
the style of my hair right now I did to
a middle part kind of like um I was
going for maybe like a Kim Kardashian
kind of look like the middle part
through our foster look I'll go Farrah
Fawcett cashews the first one to clean
this look and it's really just like nice
pretty waves I curled it but the curls
are kind of dropping right now but I
actually like the way they drop they
dropped together and they bundle
together so I cut the closure of a bit I
just like trimmed the ends the closure
is pretty thick um has like a lot of
hair I didn't want to bleed it down I
just left it the way it was um I
basically just
custom lanes into a mini affair foster
kind of style and I did on breathing
here I bleached it here first with a
developer and then I did go in and I
added some color into it some parts may
be a bit lighter and like right here
like some well right you could see in
the light some parts may seem a little
bit lighter but that just gives it's a
beautiful contrast and everyone is
obsessed with the hombre I mean I don't
think where I live a lot of people as
our effect I don't think that many
people where I live I live on the east
coast in Connecticut so not that many
people did their own braid down here I
think I'm like one of the few where in
my town has ever done it and everybody's
like oh my god but yeah so like I said
guys check out best lyrics calm if
you're interested in shopping here I
will shop here definitely again because
I love this hair I did see two other
people that did reviews on this but they
didn't do reviews in depth and they said
it sucks but I don't really think it
sucks I actually liked it in lasted a
long time
it's lasted about three months and the
hair is still it still have like a lot
of life song just um you know gotta keep
your options open out there so nice
talking to you guys have a nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
