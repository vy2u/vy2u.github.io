so this is the hair now this hair guys
came from Wiggins hair company and I
created my own unit with this hair so
this is their curly hair texture now
this one could have turned out a little
bit better but I was trying to do too
much with this hair so I'm gonna be
completely honest with you guys I wish I
would have kept this hair black just
because when I came natural color to me
it was just perfect I know that it was
gonna turn out to be like just a great
wig but I was trying to do too much
trying to create colors trying to do
summertime springtime things and then I
got caught up so basically with this
hair guys I processed it and if you want
a video on how I color this unit I just
leave your comments down below because I
do have some clips of it now for this
guys I did process it and kind of color
it up and stuff like that and I kind of
just did each bundle by itself to kind
of give myself some kind of dimension
and you can see here there's kind of
like different mixes of blondes and
stuff like that
and at the end obviously it goes back
down so blonde so I like the dimensions
um I was kind of going for some type of
like Beyonce kind of color style hers is
really platinum but I wanted to do one
that's gonna complement my skin so this
is the kind of color I came up with now
I really like this but the issue with
this guy's is the frontal just failed me
all types of way the frontal will not
keep its hair so basically I have like
at least two bald spots on my right hand
side right here which is the side that
actually favored so I was able to cover
this side perfectly with no issues but I
was cold I was washing the hair and I
realized when I was coming with that hat
I was receiving a lot of shedding and
I'm like why am I getting all of his
shedding so when I flipped over the wig
I was at it's coming from the
front oh so I don't know if I over
processed the frontal because what I
initially did was bleached a whole
entire frontal and then I went in and
added roots after I don't know if I left
it bleach on too long or if the cuticle
too cuz just did it kind of handle it or
something I don't know what it is but
the frontal fails me miserably guys so
I'm definitely like a little bit
disappointed in that I wish I would have
kind of just left it black like I said
or kind of did just like little
highlights in the unit instead of trying
to go overboard and do the most now I do
like this guys I do like the color I do
like the style now as far as a frontal
matching the closure I mean
the frontal matching the hair it doesn't
match all the way but it just gets by
just enough so you guys know I have
these issues with kind of like these
companies are saying you know but
bundles that are all the same kind of
pattern and then the front will be like
the same pattern when you get it but
then when you wash it it's like two
different worlds so I'm gonna
particularly don't like that kind of
stuff just because I want my hair to all
be unison all match that's why I prefer
sometimes to just buy wigs that are
pre-made because you already know it's
gonna all match one pattern but with
this one guys
I do kind of get like a little bit of a
looser wave in the frontal and then I
get like a nice kinky curl at the bottom
but the thing about this that I like is
that it's kind of like a crazy wig not
crazy it is it's kind of like one of
those Crazy Legs the wings that you
created that's just colorful fun and
playful so even if the wind hits just
the wrong way I wouldn't be offended
just because I would like it to be kind
of crazy and out there I mean the baby
hairs are slayed the part is realistic
so as long as those aspects of the unit
is are like OnPoint I really don't care
if this is kind of crazy out there or
whatever but I do like it one thing I'm
gonna let you guys know is make sure you
let it air dry don't play in it because
once you play in it it's gonna just
destroy the curl pattern I still have
some curl pattern in it so it's kind of
like you know it didn't get damaged the
bundles in the back actually did very
well when it came to processing like I
said the frontal just has like a really
different pattern and I don't know if I
over process the frontal and that's why
it's doing that but I definitely have to
scrunch a little bit to manipulate it so
it can all blend together but right now
like straight on the camera I feel like
it looks nice it looks decent now what I
would say to you guys if you purchased
this here I would recommend that you
know think about bleaching it um I don't
know if I just did a bad job I don't
know if this video is a fail video but I
did my best and honestly the ending
result didn't come up too bad I just
wished that I would have reverted back
to black before I kind of went too far
and did the most so guys I will leave
all the information down below if you're
interested in purchasing this hair from
wiggins hair company
do not forget guys the thumbs up this
video leave your comments down below
subscribe and share this video with your
friends and family people and I would
catch you guys
