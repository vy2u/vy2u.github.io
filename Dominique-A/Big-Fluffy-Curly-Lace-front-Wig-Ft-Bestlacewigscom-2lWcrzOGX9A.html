how's it going so I'm back today with
another hair view so today's here of
your view is brought to you guys from
best lace wigs calm now today's unit
that I'm showing you guys is the style
number swo 9 - now this is a natural
color and it is the length 22 inches so
this way right here is a virgin
brazilian deep way styled hair now it is
curly deeply as curly whatever you want
to call it now I've been reviewing a lot
of the curl units because I want to show
you guys different things other than
straight and body wave because that can
just get boring as well so I'm going to
show you guys another color unit today
so this one is pretty pretty deep wave
guys it's really really pretty
now I'm Co washing here I'm going to
just unbox this one cut the lace off and
try to style it on my head as usual it
does have about two to three inches of
parting space at the top right here
along with three combs two on the sides
in one at the base as well alone with a
comb in the back with a little bit of
lace for ponytails and it does have an
adjustable strap now the capsized on
this one I believe is a size medium calf
size it is very stretchy so if you do
have a larger size head you'll be okay
with this unit now I'm really excited
about this one because I do really like
the curl pattern and the fact that I
didn't co wash it previously before
actually show you guys the unit's going
to be better because I can send your
combing out with a wide tooth comb and
kind of make it more of a kind of dry
big curl instead I am probably going to
do a side part or a middle part with
this one just because those are my
security blankets
I'm not going to do like up down here
start with this one just because I want
to try something other than that so I
hope you guys enjoy this if you are
interested in the hair that I'm wearing
right now this was my last Wednesday
video so make sure you check that out
this hair is poppin I'm not going to say
anymore just go out and check the video
and if you're interested in seeing what
this unit looks like today guys I would
like you to stay tuned
alright guys so this is what the unit
looks like once I've put a little bit of
the baby hair down I cut the lace off I
did add some powder at the parting space
and I just played with it a little bit
like I said two guys I wasn't in the in
the category of wetting this here I just
wanted to kind of curl out the curls
just to make them look like big dry
curls I think that this looks good it's
nice to kind of call wash it and then
kind of letting it dry overnight and
then try to wear it the next day but for
some reason I love when you first get
the hair and it has its distinct curl
pattern I just think that's when it's
like it's most prettiest so I wanted to
do this unit just straight off the path
on my head and styles which I mostly do
with some of my units but with my
Kirlian is I like to wash it before I
put it on but this one guys looks really
really pretty
I do like the curl pattern like I said
it's a deep wave so when you do finger
coming out it gives you more of that
kinky spicy cool look it definitely is a
nice unit guys and it fits my head
perfect I just adjusted the straps in
the back and I put the combs in on the
side and in the back it is pretty full
and does get a little bit flat in the
back which is a little bit weird so what
I'm having to do is kind of comb it in
the back and kind of buff it up a little
bit but let me show you guys what the
back looks like so the hair is a great
length guys it's not super long it's 22
inches long but when you're dealing with
curly hair you do lose a little bit of
the length so this is about how long it
is guys like I said I do like it like
this if I'm going for really nice long
curly hair I'll go for 24 to 26 inches
well 24 to 28 because that'll give you
like that really really long look
but for this unit I'm very satisfied
with it I have not received any shed
shedding I do get a little bit of
tangling but that's just because the
pattern has been broken yet but I do
like it a lot guys
leave all the information down below for
you guys if you guys are interested in
this unit and this is going to be one of
my favorites and I might add it to my
wig sale next month so stay tuned for
that
