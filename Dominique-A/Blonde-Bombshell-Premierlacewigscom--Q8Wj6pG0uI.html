hair review and this hair review is from
a company called premier lace wigs calm
I was not sent this hair for a review
I'm reviewing this hair for my own
pleasure I wanted to do a different
video today just because I never did
reviews for on wigs from companies I'm
used to creating my wigs by myself but
today I decided to actually purchase a
wig and customize it with myself all the
products that I use to customize this
way will be listed down below in the
description bar this wig was 12 inches
and it's in a bob style and it's
basically the Ciara inspired lace wig
they have a whole bunch of the weights
on their website but this one jewel me
because I'm looking for our nice blonde
color for the summer um but when I first
got the hair I noticed that the hair was
very very like brassy looking I didn't
like the tone of the blonde so basically
what I ended up doing was toning the
hair down into an ash blonde color that
would suit my skin complexion so I hope
you guys find this video very
informative and make sure you thumbs up
this video and subscribe if you haven't
already and I will catch you guys later
all right guys so I'm back today to show
you guys that the hair looks like so
this is the hair from premier lace wigs
and this is a seer inspired way
obviously if you saw in the beginning of
the video or in clips or whatever the
hair was not what I expected it to be um
now that I have covered the hair and
lighten the hair up a little bit now you
can fully see the color that I actually
wanted like I said this color is more of
a color that compliments as darker skin
tone women like me for my Coco skin so
this looks really good it's like an a
sheer blonde it is not one of those high
yellow pigmented blondes if it was me
wearing this sweater right now would not
look right it would look crazy I think
that it complements if I were to wear
like a yellow outfit or like a yellow
dress or something this will work
perfect um and that's a baby here's our
under perimeter by didly some of my
hairs on the side not too much because
I'm I just got my hair my real hair done
so I just got a little bit of my own
sides out um you can go in and I was
think about going in ages targeting this
a little bit right here just to give it
some more definition but I do like the
concept of the blonde starting very high
up into the to the Bing part and kind of
setting high up here cuz it just throws
a lot of contrast to the face and so it
looks really good
this is something like really summery
really really springtime look I really
like it I would try to do some makeup
that's really toned no dark eyeshadows
no nothing crazy maybe this would be
perfectly fine for it but I really do
like this here guys and it is kind of
like a nabob wing so I will show you
guys to the side looks like and
obviously this sides a little bit longer
than the other side I just pull it a
little hair out like that sometimes so
this side is much like this versus this
side which is a little bit longer you
guys could see that variation the back
let me see I could show you guys the
back the back is about like that nothing
crazy um in yeah so I pretty much really
really feel like I could rock with this
hair I really like it and I hope that
you guys found this video informative a
lot of girls
who are like of my skin complexion they
feel like they can't pull off hair
colours like this for reasons that I
don't really know because I feel like
anybody can pull off a hairstyle like
this as long as you make sure that the
color combinations that you use to
achieve the blond is it's complimentary
to your skin complexion so I really like
this hair color I really like the style
the cut
it's fun it's free and it's perfect for
vacation
summertime looks um I'm definitely gonna
keep this rockin and yeah so like I said
guys if you guys are interested in more
hair reviews or wig reviews from
companies I can do those for you I did
purchase this wig with my own money just
because I wanted to do it for fun like I
just wanted to try something else out
for fun so if you guys found this video
informative and would like to see more
like wig reviews from companies and just
leave your comments down below um I
never been sent a wig well maybe I have
been sent a wig from a company before
but I primarily do extensions sold in on
a cap and then create my own wigs but
this time I wanted to try something
different that was already pre-made and
just put a spin on it by myself so I
thought that I hope you guys think that
this was somewhat informative and yeah
so make sure you thumbs up this video
also make sure you leave our comments
down below and make sure to subscribe
today and I will catch you guys later
