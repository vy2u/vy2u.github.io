Padma yeah yeah what if you what you
beat you yeah it's a five part Indian
what tell me Mike is not let's stop down
back today on another with Wednesday
with another wave review now this big
review is brought to you a from a
company called my first wigs calm and
this website is specialized for first
time wait where's the wig buyers so it's
this video quality wig website made for
beginners so I thought this will be
perfect for my channel especially with
Wednesday seeing that a lot of my
subscribers have been asking questions
about buying wigs and purchasing weights
for the first time so this company
specializes for people like you who have
never won a wig before and want to know
more about it and a ways to easily
customize the wig or kind of like pieces
that will help you on to the wig at the
beginning of a wig life basically so the
way that I'm showing you guys today is
the Valentine's Malaysian ombre hair
this is a color to and number five and
it's a wig stock number l fw oo 7 this
is 14 inches long it is a yaki texture
and it is a cap size number 1 I have a
medium brown lace and my wig cap color
is brown as well and this is a lace
front wig now the weight comes in this
awesome box with all these cute
accessories that come with it so first
obviously are you get the wig caps that
the favor your staff color this one's
kind of like a brown color this favors
me good it's just enough its slide
enough and dark enough just to kind of
blend in with my regular shop color so I
definitely use these all the time using
black doesn't really benefit you that
unless so it's better to just kind of
use a wig cap that matches your scalp it
also comes with this cute little packet
right here and this is like a little zip
up bag with some - accessories and items
in it that will help you on your journey
so first time wig wearing so then the
packet you get this cute little pamphlet
it's an instruction book it basically
tells you everything you need to know
about like putting your wig on you know
22 have eyes in here and she's actually
the person that's actually showing you
guys how to do it in here to them so
they actually show you everything that
you need to know about putting your
weight on for the first time how to make
it look natural and they also have
muffins is my lever on here too so they
have a lot of people from YouTube on
here showing you guys how to put the
wigs on how to make it look natural etc
etc so what comes in the bag it comes in
one carrier bag one rat tail comb a
foldable wig stand polyester wig cap it
comes with two hair clips and a pack of
bobby pins which is 18 pieces so
obviously you get all the stuck in the
bag
didn't say elastic good mmm
diva said but it does come at elastic
band as well so as we put these on all
my wigs because I like my wigs to be
nice and secure if you if you guys watch
it I mean that give you guys seen me
before I'm always adding elastic band to
my wigs just because I like the way it
stays flat better with an elastic band
so they did give an elastic band with
this you get your rat tail comb to kind
of blend in and make it look natural you
also get two clips and then your set of
bobby pins as well so everything that
you need to kind of achieve your look
with these wigs they provided for you in
the pack now so many guys with the hair
looks like it comes in this cute little
pack right here that says my first wig
and it's so cute it has its own little
wardrobe right here so this is a unit
that I opted for and this is gorgeous
guys it's kind of like this kind of like
a dark blonde kind of like orangie
brassy tone color obviously toned down
to make it look good but it's more so
like an orange look and the light right
now looks kind of orange but I'm kind of
going for that look right now so I'm
really excited about this
it does have about six inches of parting
space no doubt like the parting space
starts all the way up here and then it
ends like all the way down here so it's
about six inches the parting space may
be more it does have two combs at the
top right here and also has a comb
in the background here with an
adjustable strap and a little bit of
lace in the back in case you want to do
a ponytail or whatever you want it does
come in a middle part style so I'm
probably just going to keep the middle
part style the way it is and I'm going
to style this here for you guys so you
guys will see a different way to style
it if you do get the wig so this is
going to be kind of a learning
experience people so one thing I'm going
to say that I really like about this one
is I want to point out is that it is
dark routed but it's not only dark
routed right here is even if when you
part the hair the hair is dark routed
anywhere so even when you're parting the
hair and other options the hair is still
saying dark routed which i think is
excellent like you that's like top
right there so I'm really excited about
this one so I'll be interested to see
what this unit looks like I want you to
stay to make evil that's all you know
Padma yeah yeah what video what video
yeah it's about not in dead what gel
might fit on that me I will click on
ugly because when you watch topic you
might click on a stereocenter
bring it on up
and I like to do anything and I must be
like Monday why number damn am i doing I
know my skin but Monday I am only what
you want them to yell over this controls
my mother is also white and blue you
gonna be time accurately so tell me what
you want me to do I will give you all
that more godmother feel awful

with your mother cries I'll feed in her
feeding her so i one thing i want i want
no more control yellow godless control
my mother
while um cool people will be paired with
me so that was the one I will give you
all your guys so this is what the unit
looks like I absolutely love this custom
unit from my first weeks comm if you are
a beginner with wigs and this is the
first time that you're considering
purchasing a wig I would recommend
buying your way from this website they
provide so many things with the wig so
that you're fully prepared and that
you're fully ready to try your first day
out for the first time see this is a
really cute style guys this is a bob
style I did kind of go out there with
the coloring I just thought the color
would just be something different I just
like it's kind of more so of a ginger
tone wig and I love how they did the
ombre on the roots I did add a little
bit of pressed pot in the parting just
to kind of make it look a little bit
more realistic
I didn't tweeze it or open it up this is
a natural part that they have created
for this unit so it is flawless so I am
absolutely in love with this unit guys I
think it's so cute I did go ahead and
straighten it all the way around I'll
turn around to show you guys at the back
looks like so the hair looks so flawless
guys I didn't have to do any adjustments
to it by cutting it or anything like
that the wig was already pre-cut and
it's like perfect like this so I am
really really pleased with this unit I
haven't had like a custom colored unit
in a long time so this one provides all
the custom quality that I really like
you know I have to die to do anything to
it so it's perfect like this and I just
like this orange reddish look I don't I
thought it was kind of like orangish
kind of to me the light is giving me an
orange vibe but I just think it's so
cute and if you're looking for a bob
style that's effortless and that's
minimal work this is the perfect bob so
yeah make sure you guys check out this
website I will leave all the links down
below for this unit and the website
itself don't forget to thumbs up this
