hey guys how's it going son back today
with the hair of you and this here I
refuse a little bit different this time
around I decided to try crochet for the
first time I was online looking for like
hair cool hairstyles last year I did do
the braids with the shave sides so I
decided to try this dreadlock look out
so the hair that I purchased is the body
boss bomba dreadlocks
and I bought three packs of it I only
have like a little patch in my head that
I wanted to crochet so I wasn't sure if
I needed two packs or three packs so I
just bought three packs just to be safe
I've ordered this half of Sam's Beauty
calm and the hair came very fast it came
within like four days four to five days
um and they had a lot in stock I think I
recently went to check and they didn't
have that much in stock so if you're
really interested in trying out a
hairstyle with the full dreads I would
suggest that you go and check out a
couple of the online websites or even
try your beauty supply store this is
what the package looks like guys and a
lot of people on YouTube have been
starting to do reviews on this I just
wanted to come and show you guys my
rendition or my style living of doing
the dreadlocks I obviously do not have
hair all over my head so therefore I
ended up just doing the small portion of
my hair that is actually um long enough
to braid and this is basically the braid
but as you can see that anchor braid
right here is very loose because my hair
is very soft so like I said next time I
will probably just use braiding hair
just to give it like a really tight
braid um other than that I'm not not
like I really like it so I'm not really
like sweating about it not be about it
being too loose I did I order three
packs as you can see there's some
highlighted parts in here I got a number
two and number one being a number one be
30 I just wanted to do the 1b 30 to give
the hair like a little bit of highlights
to make it look really nice and
different so far so good I do notice
that the hair does stick together a lot
like you'll have to separate some of the
hair sometimes but the only reason why I
like that is because it actually will
stay in the style that you want so if I
want to do it like this then I leave it
like that for awhile and just keep it
like twisted so I like this it'll stay
like that
I do do like a high bun at the top of my
head sometimes too I'll just show you
guys how I kinda like to the high bun
and I do sometimes do this high but at
the top of my head like this just if I
want to change up the style or do like a
cute little ponytail like that or just a
side ponytail like this so the hairstyle
is very versatile you can do it like a
lot of looks with it which I really like
so yeah I hope you guys think that this
video is very informative I just wanted
to do something different I've been
doing a full head I thought that maybe
if I switched it up and just did my half
head that'll be really nice and I've
been getting a lot of compliments from
people so therefore it's a thumbs up
other than that guys are here in spine
for in I will list the price down below
but I'll tell you guys it was $6.99 a
pack so that you cannot be they do have
other brands that saw the dreadlocked
crochet extension so if you want to try
those out just kind of look through the
search engine on YouTube to find other
women who have done the dreadlock
extensions as well but for this price
and the texture which really sold me
because the texture looks very very
natural I definitely bought the bombuh
dreadlock so if you're interested in
this here I'll leave the link down below
for you guys and if it is out of stock
here you can try a thousand on their
website now to provide the hair for
around the same price as well so leave
all your comments down below make sure
you thumbs up this video and I will
catch you guys later bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
