is just an update on my breast
augmentation it's been approximately
like three months almost four months
since I got my breast augmentation and
I'm not having been coming to you guys
like often with these videos but because
I just went bra shopping for the first
time ever I decided to come today and
talk to you guys about my experience and
how my girls are doing so basically um
everything is better now don't get any
pain I can sleep on my sides now the
only problem I see is sleeping on your
stomach it kind of comes with a lot of
pressures out on the boob so I just stay
away from that the star where my implant
is that is under the areola so therefore
because I'm moving to target skin
complexion and my nipples are all
naturally dark this scar is not really
visible to the naked eye as much as I
can see it like if I'm standing naked in
front of you you're not gonna see the
scar tissue out of the scar at all so it
looks really good and I'm very happy the
last time went to see my doctor he's
very pleased with the way they look he
actually said that they actually healed
very very well and I always come by
telling him how I did it and like how
the boobs were really coming close
together at the same time the anatomy of
my body prior to the breast implants my
boobs were never like perky up and close
together so therefore with the breast
implants when you get them done you need
to massage the boobs together so I
haven't massaging my breast implants
together and I haven't doing all the
massages and stuff that he recommended
so I do see a lot of improvement with
the boobs coming closer together I mean
I didn't mean like I want the boosts to
be like this because that's just not
gonna actually happen my breast implants
are moderate-plus profiles so therefore
they're not like the high profile I
didn't want the high profile because I
felt like the high profile kind of looks
unnatural a little bit and moderate-plus
profile was just right in the middle and
it just drops naturally and it doesn't
look so high see if I would have got the
high profile that have probably been all
the way up here and I just it just
didn't go with my natural Anatomy so
yeah so I'm very happy with the way they
look and
everything about them I don't like I
said I don't have pain anymore I'm able
to sleep regularly and another thing I
still wear sports bras and now I'm
wearing bras before after the surgery
he's telling me I can only wear sports
bras but he finally gave me the clear to
wear regular girls and like I said if
you guys don't remember if you guys
haven't watched my last videos I am I
got 400 cc saline implants so when I was
talking to him about the point two cc's
he told me that it would be when I go
get Sasha bras it would be in the D
range so I already might automatically
knew what size I was going to go for or
what size I was gonna get when I
actually got size so I went to
Victoria's Secret and wait a minute I
know you guys gonna be like I don't
recommend Victoria's Secrets to go get
size the first time for people were in
bras because you guys don't know before
when I didn't have breasts I would
rarely I don't I didn't really wear bras
because I didn't have boobs so it didn't
matter just wear nothing sometimes so
this is my first time going to a real
store and actually buying a real bra so
it was really exciting for me um and
because I know that a lot of people said
that Victoria Secrets wasn't the place
to go to get fitted for your bras I
still went anyways and I I made the
final decision with what fit me the best
I did let the lady size me up but I did
tell her I like this I like this I don't
like that don't like that and she kept
giving me other bras to try on and stuff
like that so I did have a chance to pick
what I want and really really get the
chance to size myself correctly so the
size that I got is the 34 double D
breast implants when I press the place
34 double D bras the bra that I have on
today right now is the Victoria's
Secrets t-shirt bra and it basically
looks like this and this is just one of
their two for $48 bras and it's um it's
like a basic bra guys and as you guys
can see the boobs are looking absolutely
great and if you could see right now and
I'm telling you guys that it doesn't
come like like very close very close
together like this but I guess this is
like a natural way of the breast
implants looking um I'm not sure I don't
really I can't compare my breast
implants other people's breast implants
because like I said we all have
different Anatomy so it's just going to
be different no matter what
I do feel like they look very natural I
have tried bikinis on and I've tried
like dresses without bras and they look
absolutely great so it's really really
exciting but this is what they look like
right now just with a regular t-shirt
bra and teacher bra does have a kind of
padding on the outside so that you don't
get like hard nipples which I've been
getting a lot of hard nipples with the
sports bras obviously and it was really
embarrassing and annoying but this is
t-shirt bra and it's very nice and I do
have it on the first hook so if I were
to put it on the third hook they're
probably very hosted up like this and
stuff like that but this bra does
wonders um I'll show you guys two other
bras I got I got this bra from out with
this bras called maybe I'll link the
name of this bra down below this was a
bit more expresses like fifty two
dollars and this is kind of like when
they're supposed to be like good ass
bras and I did try this on it I'm not
gonna lie this looks absolutely great
and like I said guys this is a size 34
double D as well and this is just what
the bra looks like there look it's it
fits goods very soft and it's black and
has like this little lace pattern in the
front of it and I absolutely love this
bra guys and like I said this was fifty
two dollars and the other bras I got
were two for 48 so this is the other
broad guy and it's just basically like a
multi-way bra I like this a lot because
I want to reel out a tube top kind of
outfits or dresses and jumpers in the
summertime and I don't want to have like
hard nipples if I don't wear it if I
don't wear a bra and these outfits so I
decided to get a black a bra can make
strapless and this looks really good
strapless it does hold the girls up very
nicely and you can convert it like
several ways you guys know when you can
do this multi way cutting bras so it
just looks like this and I got a new
just because um I wanted a new bras well
other than black so basically I bought
two black Ross and one new bra and I did
purchase a new uh I did go ahead and
purchase new sports bras as well just
because I like the way sports bras feel
and the way they look and he does
recommend that I could see you wearing
sports bras to bed so therefore I just
stock up on the new sportswear else
which I'm not gonna show in this video
but yeah so that's basically it guys if
you guys have any
questions or comments yes believe it
down below I believe my doctor's
information down below for you guys if
you guys live in the East Coast I'm from
Connecticut and he's out in Westchester
New York which is about 25 minutes from
where I live
if you're in this location you're
looking for a good plastic surgeon you
can just go check them out set up a
consultation get to know him a little
bit and feel comfortable with him and
maybe set up a breast augmentation on a
scale of one to ten my experience was
basically a knock I'll say basically a
ten it was an amazing experience what I
do it again I probably would do it again
but I feel like I wouldn't need to even
go up another size because once I have
kids I'm pretty sure my boobs actually
get really really big on top of the
implants but if I ever do decide to go
up to a 500cc I would most certainly go
back to talk to Greenwald because he's
amazing and that's about it guys thumbs
up this video guys if you guys liked it
leave your comments down below and I'll
catch you guys in another video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
