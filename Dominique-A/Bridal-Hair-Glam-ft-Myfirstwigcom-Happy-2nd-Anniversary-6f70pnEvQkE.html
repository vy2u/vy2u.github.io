Hey
so here's what the final results of the
hair styling and the whole theme of the
look looks like now when I first started
recording the video I was kind of
confused on how to get like a bridal
inspired looks just because I'm not
married and I don't know this is
happening soon for me or whatever but I
was kind of going through the phases
trying to figure out what to do but then
I thought to myself Dom what would you
actually wear to your wedding I'm not an
updo person I just don't like up to this
is not my thing
so I really like my hair down like
really long and I feel like I'm flowing
so I decided to do like a mermaid look
for this wedding inspired look now the
crown the floral crown definitely add
some extra pizazz to it because it gives
you more of this this nubian kind of
flower child kind of look and it is
going to go well with kind of like a
wedding thing just because it looks very
very refined and put together I did try
to do like some type of Bridal makeup
I'm not a makeup artist so you guys
already know that so I try to do
something that I would do for my wedding
I probably go a little bit crazy on the
makeup but I wanted to make it subtle so
therefore it looked kind of like a nice
effortless kind of fun look so I hope
you guys like this now as far as this
wig goes I will link down everything
down below for this unit this unit is
excellent it's from my first wigs as you
guys know it is really really pretty
guys the hairline and everything is
super super perfect now I did have this
in the cipher at the beginning of the
video but I decided to go in and make it
a middle part which I honestly think
looks better so I did do a middle part
just added some pressed powder to it to
kind of make it look more realistic and
it is a full lace wig so you can part it
any freaking where you want I usually do
my just I don't know this wig looks just
so good like it looks so realistic now
if you check out my last wig review
through my first ones you guys were in
love with that short haircut now this
one to guys is very very pretty I think
that this is a look that a lot of girls
would be familiar with doing for their
wedding I just thought this was I was
being true to myself by keeping it into
something that I would do and I really
liked it so I hope you guys enjoyed this
