today and I'm stopping by today to do an
eyebrow tutorial I've been asked to do I
brought tutorial requested that I do an
eyebrow tutorial and as you can see I
one of my eyebrows is already done right
now and I did do my full face makeup
routine makeup already so therefore
that's already done if you guys want to
know what type of lashes I have one I've
been asked a lot about my lashes these
last days right here are probably the
most at Rose lashes I've ever had
naturalist they're probably the most
natural lashes that I've ever had and
these lashes are the elf natural lash
kit and these were $1.00 at Target and
target also carries that up a whole
bunch of elf items and they're all
priced like $1 $2 $3 and up and well
three thousand then goes five so nothing
over $5 you will buy from ELF which is
really good so you should check out your
target cos owner is trying to carry the
elf line which is awesome
because I live around a bunch of targets
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
show you guys how I get my eyebrows to
look really cool on this side because
I'm trying to match it with this side
the thing about my eyebrows are they're
really small and thin so basically I'm
just reconstructing my whole eyebrows if
I was getting plastic surgery right now
so it's not like I'm starting from an
actual framework I basically have to
make them by myself because as you can
tell my eyebrows are like super super
thin which really sucks and I blame that
for going to the salon the nail salon
too much and getting my eyebrows waxed
but I had like I just had this thing
about I had to get my eyebrows up even
when it wasn't time for me to get it
done so that's my fault
but it's okay that's the wonders of mint
of makeup cause look what I could do
with my eyebrows down so it doesn't even
matter
um so I'm gonna start the video it's
gonna be really quick because I'm used
to doing this a lot I hope you guys can
follow along because some of you guys
probably already know how to do this
I've tried it before I mean there's a
lot of cool videos on YouTube that show
you how to get your eyebrows that look
all pretty and stuff like that so I hope
that this video is very informative and
I hope that you guys like this video I'm
trying to do different videos so I hope
this one works and so what I'm gonna
start off do it with is my eyeliner from
Jordana and I got this from Walgreens
for a one buck and it's in the number 38
or 38 dark brown and it's pretty
cool love this eyeliner it's like a nice
dark brown color perfect for my eyebrows
and I'm gonna try to draw my eyebrows in
right now just to see the form I want my
eyebrows to be so I'm just gonna shape
them up the way I want them to be and I
did clean my eyebrows yesterday with
like one of those little razor thingies
um like I said I don't go to the nearest
line in order to get a wax there's
nothing I'm really waxing off my face
right now of my eyebrows so that have no
eyebrows so I rather just get that
little cleaner-upper and I just clean
them up so it's gonna look like they're
really chunky and like they look like
really big caterpillars on my face which
is fine because I will get it to go down
like this
and I don't draw a box I used to draw a
box before but I don't draw a box
anymore I I just like mesh it in and it
turns out the way I want it so now it
looks like a big old caterpillar like
this right here is not the way to rock
an eyebrow some people wear their
eyebrows like this but for me no I'm not
gonna wear my eyebrows like that but to
each his own so what I'm gonna do now is
get my Maybelline New York concealer in
the number 30 in its um cafe so this is
a Maybelline concealer it's a bitch
shades lighter than my skin complexion
but I like it
the consistency of this concealer is the
 so I just want to get a concealer
brush I really think of Stella brush
like this my pink one loved it and I
just want to put some concealer on it
just just a little bit and I'm gonna put
this one right below her apart and try
to clean it up a little bit
if you guys have like any questions or
anything you guys could just leave the
questions down below for me and I'm
really good right now with answering
some questions it's just like I'm really
preoccupied right now I'm trying to make
videos today is actually my day off of
school so I can actually make videos
today which is really neat and I'm
excited about that but I have a lot of
remediation to do so this is just
temporary because I have homework to do
when I'm done have a lot of stuff I need
to do a lot of pharmacology and a lot of
med search is killing my ass right now
so got to make sure that I get on my
feet so I can graduate guys um so
basically I'm just cleaning it up right
now to make it a little bit thinner than
what it was before um so now I'm gonna
go to the top and get a little little
bit cuz I don't want it to look too like
crazy on the top part so I'm gonna go
towards the top on the top of the
eyebrow and I'm just gonna get some
concealer and put it up like a little
bit of its concealer on the eyebrow in
the top part and this is how this is how
I do to clean it up a little bit it'll
come out looking bright as hell but I
will freakin mix this button really
badly okay
and all they just do is take my my hand
and I just blend this one on so now you
can see like that big indentation right
here where the gap is between so what I
do with my fingers just take it and I
swipe it back like that and you can see
the tail right here needs to be fixed
just a little bit so we just want to
make sure we go down into that one and
mix this in a little bit so it doesn't
look so dramatic and just run your hands
I usually run my hands to like that oh
my god they actually want to take a
little bit higher than the other but you
know what I do for that one I take a
little bit more concealer just a little
bit not too much
and I go on the top again and I just
decrease his line just a little bit
what I so that's how the eyebrows come
out looking and if you want to you can
go back in a little bit more and you can
just shave just a little bit more in
outside on both sides and take your
fingers and rub them back so you don't
look like you have a unibrow so now what
I'm gonna do is take my ELF slash brow
and clear mascara and I'm gonna just use
my concealer to go steal a blush to get
some of the clear stuff off and this is
what it looks like it's pretty cool
and I just want to feel like a little
bit on my brush and I just want to put
it on the brow
okay
so so guys um that was like probably the
quickest eyebrow um video I think I was
rambling a lot earlier before the video
so that's why the video is almost like
at eight minutes right now but that's
how I achieve my eyebrow look you
basically just let the eyebrows sit for
a couple minutes in the clear draw the
clear um
brow well the clear stuff on the eyebrow
will dry off and that's we speed it guys
if you guys have any questions or
comments leave them down below and this
is a quick weave from the previous video
