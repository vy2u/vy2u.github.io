- guys I'm back today with another wig
Wednesday now today's with Wednesday's
from a company that I've worked
previously twice now this company is oMG
your hair calm I just been working with
them a lot lately just because I've been
very pleased with all the unit steps are
so at this time when I'm doing a bob
style unit it is bob season so I wanted
to come with more Bob's I did one bob
from my first weeks calm now this one is
just all black Bob that I want to show
you guys I'm going to keep in it's all
black colleges because I think it looks
really sleek and cool so I'm just going
to keep it this way
and I try to do any additives to it to
make it look different so it is a Yaqui
textured unit and it is 12 inches and
they cut it into this perfect bob look I
think this is so epic you guys one thing
I noticed about this one is that you can
see the texture like very close up if
you look at it the textures like real
african-american textures it does have
about like three inches of parting space
at the nape I mean at the nape at the
top doing that's three inches of parting
space up here obviously you could carry
it down a little further where my hand
is indented right here it does have baby
hands around the perimeter and it does
have a little bit of lace in the back in
case you want to do a ponytail but why
would you do a ponytail with a bob I
don't know but it does provide lace in
the back as well for you guys it comes
with three combs at the top two on the
sides and one at the base it also comes
with a comb in the back as usual with an
adjustable strap yeah just about wrap so
what I'm going to do is actually add an
elastic band to it just because I like
my waist to be a little bit tighter I
have a small size head so it's really
hard when I'm trying to look for ways
that fit me they don't really fit that
well so yeah and if you're interested in
my lipgloss the lip combo that I have
one I will link it down below for you
guys as well because I know you guys are
going to ask me I never really wear
gloss and this is the first time in a
long time but I hope you guys like and
I'll leave it down below for you guys
too so if you're interested in seeing
what this bob unit looks like I want you
to stay tuned
so this is what the unit looks like I
absolutely love this cute ass Bob wig I
kind of wanted to wear it straight but
then when I saw the texture of the hair
I decided to go back in and add some
curls in it so I basically kind of curls
it up into hair and then I let the ends
go straight
I think this is a really cute edgy kind
of way of curling it shorter hair it
makes it look a little bit more fun and
edgy I just really like this here guys
the cut is really nice and fun I didn't
really curl too much of the back I kind
of like just switched around with the
curling iron to make it look fun and
crazy I did not receive any shedding any
tangling or anything like that my
favorite thing about this wig is this
quality of the texture the quality and
texture is the best thing the hair has
an african-american feel to it so it
holds a nice curl and it strains
beautifully so let me turn to the back
and show you guys how long this unit is
so that is how long a unit is it's 12
inches and obviously in the front where
the Bob kind of comes forward it's a
little bit longer in the front and then
you get back to mention in the back so I
really really like this unit guys I will
leave all the specs down below for you
guys if you guys are interested in this
unit if there is a coupon code I will
insert that on the bottom as well -
