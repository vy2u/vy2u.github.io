Wednesday now in today's video I'm
showing you guys from here I would said
to me from a company called La fiere
calm now I would set 118 inch bundle to
roll 120 inch bundle to 18s in a 16 inch
closure now I custom created this into a
unit and let me show you guys what the
unit looks like so this is the unit that
I created with the hair now I use all
the bundles in the whole entire closure
know what I say that is so funny but and
I use the closure and all three bundles
I didn't use any combs this unit just
because for some reason when I make my
units they just fit my head like perfect
and when you're using elastic then is
what kind of enhances the factor that
it's going to fit tight because the last
weave in helps flatten the wig down so I
just put that I just showed all the
tracks and this is a dome cap that I use
I showed it in my last video I added the
elastic band on and it is a little bit
snug but the reason why I made it a
little bit tighter this time is because
I have the wickets older it kind of
expands a little bit so I'm just going
to let it expand naturally instead of it
loosening up and being loose in the
beginning so that's why I made of a bit
tighter this time the wave pattern is
very pretty guys it's a natural wave
texture and this is Malaysian regulation
natural wave texture I absolutely love
this here guys I've only had it for
eivol that maybe you ate like two nights
ago and I've never even worn outside yet
but what I worn in house it just looks
so good I don't receive any shedding or
tingling whatsoever from this hair so
that's an a-plus-plus
can get past that in the beginning that
is just like everything right there
because I thought like the worst trouble
you'll ever get here but I don't get any
shedding or tangling or any of that mess
in this unit identify any products in it
I just basically co-wash it and just let
it air dry and then this is the pattern
it came in and this is what it looks
like I wish I'd have got the closure in
the 18 inches because the closure is
kind of like it's a little short for me
and the way patterning on the closure is
a little bit more labor than the actual
bundles but what I do with the closure
is I just kind of blended in what the
bundle is kind of like doing like a
light twist at nighttime so that I can
mold together so that's an easy fix so
if you want to see what this unit looks
like on me I wanted to stay tuned and
keep on laughing
and it looks like guys it's a very very
pretty loose wave texture as you guys
seen I really really like it like I said
guys it doesn't shed it doesn't tangle
and it's a very very minimalist
hairstyle like I said my unit is tight
so I'm probably like I got like a
facelift right now I just want it to be
tight as you guys can see that the
closure pattern is a little bit more
wavier than the bundles but all you have
to do is just kind of do like a light
twist with the actual here kind of fold
it into the bundles itself instead of
having it just hang out flat like that
but let me show you guys the length so
here's the pretty good length guys and I
think it looks really really good um you
can see that section hopefully you guys
can see the textured stuff but I really
do like this here guys
and I will probably rock it for my
vacations because that's the perfect
beach day here it's very very easy
simple
you're not playing any heating products
in here or any products whatsoever so
therefore even just go out with you like
this and they could even be wild and
it'd still be very nice and cute I did
add powder into my parting space
off-camera just because I wanted to make
sure the light was perfect for it but
the closure itself is pretty good and
you do do like a little bit of baby here
at the beginning of this unit are the
being of the closure so yeah so cover
with you guys think about this here make
sure you leave your comments down below
also hit that subscribe button as usual
and also um how much you think if I said
that already
oh yeah okay so I will catch you guys
later another wig Wednesday bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
