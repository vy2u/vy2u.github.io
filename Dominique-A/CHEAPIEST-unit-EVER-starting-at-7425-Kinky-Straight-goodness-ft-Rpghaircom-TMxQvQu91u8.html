today with the hair of you now today's
hair bewbs brought to you guys from RPG
hair calm
so today's week that I'm showing you
guys it's like a lace front but not
really a lace front so let me show you
guys exactly what I mean so this unit is
a kinky straight unit it is 22 inches
long and it has this much lace so you
only get like a little section here of
lace you get a lot of combs in this one
I think there's more stuff like a half
wig style or if you have like a
naturally kinky hair and you want to do
kind of like half wig styles with kind
of pony tail styles this you know be
good for you but I'm gonna manipulate it
into what I want to wear cuz right now
I'm bald so ain't no half Wiegand for me
so it comes with two combs that they
inserted on the side right here and we
Clips it also has a comb right here in
the base with a comb in the back and
adjustable strap that I've already fixed
so this hair is really long guys it's
kinky straight and I do love the texture
a lot on this unit so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna sigh part this out and I'm
gonna obviously brush some powder on the
part and straighten it out just a tiny
bit now let me show you guys the inner
part of the cap right here so you see
how they kind of like sewed the tracks
and very close to the edge so even if
the we were to lift going backwards like
this you wouldn't be able to see any of
the tracks or anything they sold like
little tracks in the inner portion right
here so therefore if the one does Bowl
you won't get any of that exposure so
the cap construction is made very well
guys so that's one thing I like about
this but I'm going to see what I can
make this look like guys so if you're
interested in seeing what this looks
like I would like you to stay tuned
I don't know what you want let's have a
beautiful fall my love if you feel like
I do right now don't say you're on the
road to the other side this is the
uniform RPG here now it doesn't give you
a lace where you're gonna do baby hairs
and stuff like that so if you're looking
for a wig like that they do have kinky
straight hair that you can lace up do
baby hear all that kind of stuff this
came absolutely no lace to cut off you
just get a little bit of lace in the
parting space one thing about this unit
is that it's very inexpensive so if
you're the type of person that doesn't
have time to be putting baby hairs down
to be cut in lace and doing all that
extra stuff then this unit will work for
you I believe this starting price for
this about like eighty seven dollars and
minus twenty two inches so I'm not sure
exactly what the price is for this one
but I will link down all the information
down below for you guys if you guys are
interested if you do have natural hair
and you have length in the front you can
definitely use this as a half link as
well too so you can definitely leave
some hair on the front and then pull it
backwards and pull your hair over to
make it into a half wig style for me
obviously because I am short haired I
have no hair right now I'm just gonna
wear mine to the middle part look you
can't do it at the side part so all you
have to do is just twirl it off to the
side and do you a good old side part
look for me I thought the middle part
was fine so I probably won't wear it in
the side part I thought the middle part
was perfectly fine the way it was it
does have a really nice texture guys I
did go in and straighten mines out you
can strangers out or you can leave it
the way it is but the texture before and
after is perfect so specifically for
this unit I have not received any
shedding or tangling so far the hair is
super super soft guys like I said it's
22 inches long so you get in a lot of
length the hair is like about a 150
hundred eighty percent density so it's
definitely giving you a lot of life I
definitely think that this is a nice
unit if you like kinky straight hair and
you're not looking for a lot of action
in the front you definitely can wear
nice scarf sets with it make it look
really Afrocentric and stuff like that
so I thought that was one thing that I
liked about this one this is definitely
also
hair I had this is also definitely a
great wig to wear with your hats if you
want to wear like baseball caps and try
to have like that cute sporty look this
unit will work perfect with that so let
me show you guys how long the hair is in
true fact as I was saying guys this unit
is truly in fact like a wonderful unit
it doesn't give you a lace that you see
most of the time like in all my videos
this is the first one I showed you guys
is a little bit of lace but for simple
styles and things like this this is
definitely a go to the texture of the
hair and the style the hair is perfect
I'm starting to really like kinky
straight hair and this kinky straight
hair is so beautiful and the 22 inch
length definitely makes it a little bit
more glamorous so yeah so don't forget
