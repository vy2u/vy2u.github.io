with another Kirby slash stick girl
China so today's video guys is actually
sponsored by hot Miami styles now hot
Miami styles guys let's just put this
out there their size range goes from
small to large so when I decided to do
this video I was very very skeptical
because I did not think that any of
these items are gonna fit me now when
you're shopping on these websites guys
make sure that you look at the material
that the items are so if it's kind of
like a stretchy material on the
description or it says it's polyester
you have a better chance of actually
fitting that item so I chose a lot of
the items that were marked polyester or
super stretchy extra stretchy or any of
that stuff now I know you guys have
noticed that I've lost some weight so I
will make a video entire video about my
weight loss journey but right now that
I'm doing it I want to keep quiet
because I'm really successful at it
while I'm keeping it in my ownself and
working towards getting better myself
involving a lot of other parties and it
just makes it crazy and then it just
ruins the whole entire feeling in the
whole entire process so I'm keeping it
to myself for now until I reach my goal
I am down 20 pounds and I'm ten more to
go and it's been great and this is the
most control I've ever had in my life
when it comes to my weight so I'm really
trying to keep a positive route and just
keep it to myself until I'm ready to
release the video for you guys but
anyways that's a side note but like I
said guys I was really skeptical about
this but when I try the items on for
this video guys I was really really
excited that some of this stuff fit now
this is not going to be your 2x 3x type
of video where you're gonna find an item
that I try on number one X and be able
to find it in two or three X but maybe
this video will give the company some
insight to introduce their items in a
plus size variety I do think that the
quality of the items from hot Miami
style are definitely up there their
quality and material is very very good
compared to fashion OVA this doesn't
this is way higher in quality wise and
actually the price wise is actually in a
higher bracket as well too so these are
things to keep into consideration if
you're someone that's looking for nice
pieces they have really great dresses
and stuff like that for occasional vents
I would definitely say check out hot
Miami styles as far as kind of like
casual wear and stuff like that but keep
it very minimal on the website but
everything seems to be really good and I
actually like everything that I
selected so guys if you're interested in
seeing what I have to offer in today's
shrine hall I would like you to stay
tuned and keep on Wow right guys so the
first item that I'm going to talk about
is a super awesome top that I have on
now so this actually came in a two piece
set so it came with a skirt and it came
with the top now I will show you
everything on the side screen so I don't
have to hold everything up for you guys
now this was a really cute item guys but
unfortunately the skirt did not fit me
the skirt was SuperDuper tight and very
short now if I was someone that was
SuperDuper flat and with skinny had no
shape had nobody or whatever and just
had that flat stomach to rock this would
be really cute but unfortunately if
you're very curvy and stuff like that it
just does not work out that well now as
far as the breast area goes on this it's
definitely very boobalicious so if
you're someone that doesn't like to
expose their chest area that much or has
like a who is very conservative
I don't think this outfit will work out
that well for you I do think that the
top is very nice it's almost like a
light sweater material it is a burgundy
color top guys and it looks super cute I
felt really comfortable in this one I
think it will look cute with
high-waisted jeans jean shorts and stuff
like that so if you buy two piece set in
the set like either/or of the item
doesn't fit it doesn't really matter you
can always convert the item into
something else so if the top doesn't fit
you you can find it another top to wear
with the bottom and if the bottoms don't
fit you can find other bottoms too at
the top so it's kind of like a win-win
situation when you buy two pieces so I
don't really feel like this one was a
fail actually found a way to wear it and
still be queueing it now the next set
that I got is a really cute set guys
it's a two piece set and it's like a
stretchy sweater material so this one is
a black and white color and it has kind
of like these long wide white sleeves
with like a black trim on it the skirt
and the top is actually fully black with
white trimmings on it which I thought
was really cute so the top comes in like
a cute little crop top with those kind
of wide fan arms and as well as the
skirt as well too so there's a slit on
the left side of the skirt that goes a
little bit high but not too high so it's
kind of like a nice clean and classy
type of two-piece and not too exposed
which I like now this one fits very good
guys it's a size large and everything
that I got is a size large this one fits
very well I feel comfortable in it if I
put some heels on with this one it'd be
really cute and like a classy outfit to
wear it's not too overly exposed and
I kind of feel like a sense of you know
like I feel like really clean and
organized in it it does show like a
little bit of stomach but you can just
roll the skirt up a little bit higher to
make it kind of like a two-piece set
without having kind of like a you know
crop top feel to it I thought this was
really nice it is one of their new
arrivals and I picked it out and I just
thought that it was cute and I'm happy
that I got it because it fit better than
I expected
so I'm super duper like in love with
kind of like bodycon style dresses so
their website actually had a body con
dress so it's kind of like a seamless
body contrast now this one does have
sleeves it's like a little bit off the
shoulder so I picked this one out in
black and you know black so I picked
this one out guys and I thought it was
really nice so this one is a size large
as well guys it definitely has a
seamless feel to it so if you do wear
shapewear underneath it you really won't
be able to see it it has that material
that I talked about in my last Tron haul
with rainbow it has this type of stretch
to it that kind of like really sucks you
in and it holds you in I don't know like
the material it's polyester material and
sometimes when you get a good polyester
material in a dress or like I like a
jumpsuit or something
it really snatches you up really good
this dress highlight this seamless
polyester feel to with that it was the
materials thick and it was covering all
the imperfections and stuff at that at
the same time snatching you up in a
really nice way this dress I really
really like and if I have like some
regular event to go to I would wear this
dress too with the belt I did try to
style this with my own belt just because
I want to kind of see what it looked
like but I like the whole entire look I
thought the look was nice it was clean
fresh everything that I was looking for
in a body kind of dress and I felt super
confident in it and it's super stretchy
which is very very good that this one
worked very well so this next dress that
I chose was super duper duper sexy like
OD sexy so this one is kind of like a
tuxedo style dress guys it comes with a
lot of accessory gold success really
success really gold accessory details on
it which I really like I'm a gold person
straight up so I was really appreciative
of all that gold accessory now this
dress is kind of uniform and it does
come with two slits in the front which
were a little bit too high for me so
I'll probably have to go in and just
close it up a little bit but as far as
the dress form-fitted wise it fitted it
fit really well
and to kind of accentuate the curves in
the right way now with this one you do
get a lot of breast action which I like
because it just kind of makes a dress
more professional and then sexy at the
same time not even professional it gives
you kind of like that professional
tuxedo look and then that really large
sex appeal with the breast and then the
cut-set that's in the front now this
dress could have been an extra-large I
could have really done well with an
extra-large it is a little bit tight on
me but I do like the way it feels if I
drop this 10 pounds I'm gonna be
snatched up in this boy so I'm just
waiting for that day to happen but I do
like how this looks I think it's really
nice accentuates my curves perfectly I
feel super confident in this one and
like I said for some reason I don't know
if it's just this company but they seem
to create stuff to hit you in the right
areas which I like so this one
definitely hits you with the peaks of
sexiness in the right area which I like
the dress is super thick guys you're not
gonna see anything in the back when I
turn around it's super super concealed
it's not thin material and it definitely
is something I would consider if you're
sick of buying stuff that's cheap
looking and that's see-through and I
would consider buying some of their
dresses or higher-end dresses on this
website because they're definitely
well-made so this two-piece set that I
got I was not really a big fan of it
when I tried it on now this is a type if
you have a belly like I do I have like a
nice pouch I like a lower pouch and I
hate it I'm almost tempted to just get a
snip the hell off but I'm not gonna do
that because it just doesn't work with
my life that way but I just these type
this type of two-piece for me just did
not really work the way I wanted it to
work now it definitely is this type of
two-piece that's going to give you a
very large camel toe and if you do have
like a belly it does put your belly in a
nice exposure type of way but I kind of
just put it on almost like to myself you
know what it is what it is my stomach is
not SuperDuper flat but it's getting to
the point where it's gonna be SuperDuper
flat
I've lost a pretty good amount of weight
where I'm starting to see a lot of
changes in my waistline and stuff like
that so it's something that I'm working
towards and I hope I can reach the goal
I want to now this two-piece is super
cute it's super sexy I really like it a
lot now it's a type of two-piece like I
said if you do not like the bottoms and
you are okay with the top you can just
put different bottoms on which i think
is a cool idea
with this one I did tried to top on what
some shorts on that thought was really
cute so I'm gonna save that outfit for
the summertime so I already have ideas
in my head now with this two-piece set
guys it's a ribbed kind of tan color
two-piece set which is cute the color is
nice the way that the dudes like a
Bardot top a Bardot top with these kind
of ankle style legging type pants is
really cute now the thing I hate about
certain place is that they don't make a
real waistband tie for the pants it's
kind of like this false one that's just
on top of the material I actually wish
the companies would just go ahead and
make a real elastic bit elastic tie just
so that if I want to tighten the pants
up I can but this one is not so
basically whatever you get with this
pants to begin in its wrong size it is
what it is you can't make it tighter and
you can't make it looser so that's the
only part that sucks I think it's really
cute it definitely fits the body very
nice accentuates all the right curves
like I said if you do have like a pouch
a stomach and you got a you know and
you're trying to work the high waist
away it doesn't really work out that
well maybe I'm just complaining because
I'm the one that always sees a problem
with my body but I just kind of felt
like this one the material on the bottom
was just not right and if you're
SuperDuper curvy or super duper like you
know muffiny or whatever it's just not
gonna work that well but for the sake of
the video I tried it on anyways I showed
you guys what it looks like and I
thought it was cute I do feel confident
in it but I like I said you know a
little bit more work on the BOD and you
know just telling myself like I do every
day
it's okay damn you got this but I do
think that outfit is cute like I said I
wish they would've thought if they had
bigger sizes this would be a really good
seller on their website just because
it's a really nice combination together
and if you notice it's not that type of
thin material when you turn around
you're gonna see all the nooks and
cranny's this one held all the nooks and
crannies together so you weren't getting
all that kind of cottage cheese effects
so I thought that this set was nice I
just wished that maybe I've got this one
if they had like a size extra large and
it had been a little bit more looser on
the body and not so much I wouldn't feel
so confined this was the only bodysuit
that I got out of the whole entire thing
and this bodysuit actually was really
really nice so this is a white rib body
shoe and it has like a little bit of
gold detailing in the
top area where you kind of have like the
buttons popped out now I like this a lot
just because it's white it's crisp it's
a bodysuit and you can either snap on a
snap off now I thought that this would
look really nice with jean shorts for
the summertime it's a really lightweight
material guys it's not itchy you're not
feeling uncomfortable in it now this is
a size large but I actually could have
size down to size medium and this one
just because in the waistline area in
the crotch air is a little bit bigger
for me but when it came to the breast
area at the top it actually fit very
nice and my boobs were like very well
you know put together in this I thought
that this one piece was the business and
like I said versus a lot of companies
their material on their items are super
thick so you're not not super thick
we're like it's 99 degrees outside
you're sweating bullets but thick enough
that you're not gonna have a lot of
exposure on any if I did like if you
don't wear a bra with this one your
nipples aren't going to be flashing
outside at the top that type of stuff
so I thought that this was really cute
guys I don't know I think it was priced
at $22 which is kind of like your
standard fashion over price but I
thought it was well put together and it
was worth the money and I just think
it's really really nice and clean like I
said I wear this with like skirts jeans
shorts jeans or whatever multi shorts
because I felt this short look like the
shorts with it just look really crisp I
really feel like I chose a lot of black
dresses this time but I do like black so
I'm gonna stay true to myself but this
dress is a little bit different because
it has a little bit of detailing line so
it kind of puts it in a different
category I think so this dress is really
cute so it's a really nice thick strap
tank dress and it does go below it goes
past the knees and it's kind of like a
gues MIDI style dress now this one is a
body con style dress but it has that
kind of like a sweater material on it I
found this dress to be very very
flattering now one thing that makes this
dress very very flattering is that on
the sides of the dress it has kind of
like an outline it basically outlines
your shape basically so there's like a
nice white band on the side that goes
all the way down and it comes with those
kind of gold accessory buttons now
they're not real ones that you just snap
off so it's kind of it's cool because if
did snap off like you know when you open
them up it'd be kind of annoying because
you would have to keep walking and worry
about it just snapping open but
this one is really cute and the white
pattern in that gold button detailing on
the side of SuperDuper cute and sexy now
with that kind of detail and on a dress
like that it definitely kind of sucks
you in and gives you more of a curve
that dress fit me so freakin nice I was
so so in love with it now this is
definitely a dress I would tell you guys
to dress up like when I mean trust let
me go put a nice heel on that and then I
would even dress down to a whirl just
like some flat sneakers I thought that
this dress was perfect it's not a
super-duper thick material where if
you're wearing it out in the 80 degree
90 degree weather you're gonna be
sweating up a storm I think that you're
gonna be just fine with this dress it
fits very nice like I said it hugs your
body in the right ways and conceals all
the imperfections and you're just
looking really snatched now this was by
far one of my favorite dresses from this
Tron huh I thought that for the season
and for the look that I was going for
that it fit very nice and it just gave
me all types of vibe so the last item
that I got is a nice plaid dress very
simple now these are really popular on
their website as well now this dress is
actually super short now I tried it on
and my sisters were like yo bro that's
too short like you're not gonna be able
to wear that but I do like it now with
this one on the website they did show
the models wearing it with a belt so I
went in with one of my waist bust and
just put it on and just looks so cute
together
I'm a platt fanatic I love plaid shirts
I I know I particularly like red and
black I think that's a really nice color
I think red looks really good on my skin
so I usually go towards the red plaid
instead of kind of like the other colors
now this one is cute but it's so short
guys so what I'm gonna say is that you
probably should wear like those biker
shorts underneath it and like some over
the knee heeled boots just to kind of
distract it a little bit but these are
soup this dress is super short but at
the same time it's very cute and it's
like it's almost like sexy and put
together at the same time so it's kind
of like a casual and sexy mixed together
the dress isn't like overly done and it
just has more of like a casual Flair so
therefore you can wear this type of
dress with sneakers and heels and kind
of like make different outfits for
different occasions which I like now I
do like how the dress is kind of peplum
saw at the bottom so kind of flares
which is cute and you do get like a
little swing in it which is you know
get like a little bit of a shimmy and
swing to it and it fit pretty good I
just felt like in the bus area it was a
little bit tight when I put the belt on
so I was kind of like you know what
maybe I should just get a bigger belt
because I don't think the dress actually
itself wasn't too big but when you're
adding a belt on it definitely kind of
shrinks up the dress even more so keep
that in mind as well alright guys so
that basically wraps up this video today
I hope you guys enjoyed this trying haul
