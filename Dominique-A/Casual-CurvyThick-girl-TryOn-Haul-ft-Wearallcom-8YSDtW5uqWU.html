girl Tryon huh now in today's try on huh
I'm showing you guys Adams from a
company called we're all calm now
everything was provided for me in for
this video so I'm going to be completely
honest with you guys
but I really really like the stuff I
actually like 90% of the stuff that I
was scented so if you're interested in
seeing what I have to show you guys in
this video I want you to stay tuned and
keep online right guys so what I'm going
to start off with first is this kind of
like sweater dressing when I first got
out I was like okay it's going to be
like a sweatshirt dressed as the ones
that select the pocket particular your
hands inside of and this is so nice they
even synthesizes so they translated
aside to us I so this I believe is the
size 14/16 and I'm going to show you
guys this I'm not even I was aware of
1416 but I tried this on and it was not
what I thought this is more like a
sweater not a dress maybe if you're like
a little bit skinnier and you're not
really curvy like I am this will fit you
but for the most part this was giving me
some trouble girl but it's really cute
it's like a distressed green army green
sweatshirt it has the pockets on the
side like I said before two pockets that
aren't too deep and you could just put
your hands in and style it up I thought
that this was really cute guys I really
really like this a lot
I will wear this so I'm not going to
wear it as a dress just because it's
just too short I probably just put
leggings on or like some jeans on
underneath pants and sneakers and that
actually would look really cute so I'm
priming awareness and this was the size
14/16 so I really like this one guy so
yeah now the next thing I want to show
you guys is this cute little cardigan
that I got and all the damn clothes off
two things
yowzers so this one is a cute cardigan
now this cardigan I was drawn to this
because of the color I love colors like
this like these khaki color well yeah
like a khaki color oak color
others will kind of call you a call this
one I want everything down below for you
guys so this one is a size medium/large
1214 which I'm more of a range of a like
that 11 12 14 10 so in color Rangers
in the that sighs but this will fit
perfect guys I really like this is cozy
it does have those perfect flips on the
slide that I really like with these kind
of cardigan sweaters and it has pockets
in the front right here which are
perfect if you just want to put like a
debit card or like shuffle coins up in
there real quick so I thought that that
was really cute and I just love the
color of it it's like a really nice
color and yeah so this was one of my
picks that I thought with great
solemnity so the next thing that I want
to show you guys are these pants now
these are supposed this is a masked boy
so these are supposed to be like palazzo
pants or whatever those wide-leg pants I
just wanted a pair of these just because
I wanted to well suck it out I want to
just wear them to the beach level of a
case in like a week and a half to the dr
so i wanted to wear these on the beat to
like make my famous or whatever and just
kind of have them or either wear them
now if you're curvy you got you have to
dissolve it off whatever you want to
call it you will not be able to wear
these I try to wear these all types away
I mean I got to go wear like a g-string
or like maybe like a nice song oh
 no but you can see your ass
cheeks right through this and this is
probably not something I would wear like
on the streets because they don't look
too classy I honestly would keep these
pants for the beach just because because
there's like a beach thing they do have
the wide legs but I'm not even that Tom
five four and the legs are kind of short
so it's just kind of like I'm just going
to say these pants for beach beach
attire and this is a size 1214 so I mean
they were inexpensive so if you just
want something like beach wear like
Beach pants I think these are dissidents
so the next thing I got is this body
suit now when I first got this body to
or when I like to pick it online I
thought it's going to look completely
different but when I got the body so I
just I wasn't really a big fan of this
same thing goes to the palazzo pants
that I got I wasn't really a big fan
when I got them but these are workable
pieces so I'm just not really too
pressed about I'm just like okay it's
not a big jacket where to go so I would
probably wear this with jeans guys it's
just like a bodysuit and just have like
a keyhole in the back right here gave
you a little bit of back
closer and the thing I like is the cold
shoulder some what they call it cold
shoulders or whatever like bixlow
shoulders right here which I really
really like because it just gives you a
little bit more sexiness this I would
wear with jeans cards I honestly would
just wear this with jeans I would not
worthy to leggings I would no fifteens
not even a skirt to be honest with you
just jeans just kind of what else hurts
it does have the clasp on the bottom so
that if you need to use the bathroom you
can just pop this off and then pop it
back on so I thought that was pretty
good so I mean like it's not my favorite
item like the palazzo pants but it'll do
so the next thing on a sir guys is this
two-piece that I got
I've always wanted to wear kind of like
loungewear / kind of like a two-piece
set this one is I think of the size let
suicide janessa so this is a US size 12
and this was so cute it's kind of like
this gray stone gray top and hat tones
with the matching still great stone gray
gray pants to the pants out pockets and
it does sound like a fake tie as these
actually are not elastic the tie doesn't
record but I think it's cute with detail
the pockets are pretty deep and it does
have kind of like the tight legs at the
bottom which I like this I probably
works I like the airport or just wear
just like kind of like lounging with
like sneakers and stuff like that and a
leather jacket just keep it real simple
I thought that this was so cute I never
ever had one of these pieces before so I
definitely had to get it one thing I
know that's kind of funny about it the
pants are kind of like really high up so
if you want to transition the pants they
were like a crop top in the summertime
or something you can get away with that
but I just don't like how high up the
pants are it's just kind of funny it
looks plenty but because the sweatshirt
is kind of like you know nice and
comfortable and like oversized you can
just cover it up or whatever but yeah
it's like really cozy and nice I love
this one right here one of my faves
now the next thing I want to show you
guys is kind of like this long shirt now
I don't know what color this is I
believe this is the size 1214 I think
and this is kind of like I'm going to
call it some matte color because it's
kind of like a cement color now this is
really cute guys I really like this
it has like flips on the side and I love
flips on the side with certain things
like this just because if you're curvy
these flips give you kind of like they
really accentuate that little forming
your body you don't say so I really like
stuff like this now this does have
adjustable arms
I guess not even a decibel it just I
guess yeah there are decimal arms to
kind of extend the arms out so it does
have the button to do that with right
here and it also I don't know it's just
I just like it guys inside obviously is
just plain and you look funny inside
inside a set size large
but the I guess size large is size 12 to
14 UK wise I'm not sure but yeah but I
believe I got when I got this attached
to size 12 but I really really like this
it's very nice and I think it's so
stylish just to throw on like leggings
or like little Spanky black shorts or
anything like that or jeans but
obviously I tried it without it so
whatever you know what to do that was
next thing I'm going to show you guys
there's two sweaters I'm really a
sweater a person and these are sweater
dresses per se now the first one that
I'm going to show you guys is this grey
one now I fell in love with this when I
saw on the website just because I
thought it was so cute and chunky when
you're curvy you're automatically
assumed that when you were like these
thick heavy chunky items that issue is
going to make you look bigger and when I
first started on out said oh my god I
look like a stuffed pig in this but like
I've been I thought about I'm like it's
gonna lose and it's supposed to be like
a chunky sweater so regardless if I
those are just stuffed pig pig in there
or not it's so cute I mean the Cooper no
you know so I thought this was really
cute it has like one of those cowl necks
I think you call it very very chunky
neck which just make it looks like
really like you I just wanted to be like
that so I thought this was cute and it
says it's a dress but
disclaimer guys you have to wear
something underneath this because it's
not a dress you can get away with we're
like Spanky shorts and over the knee
heel boots which will probably look
slimming and that you will oh my god
I'll be so cute on my yes so it does
have like a little slit on the side it's
just nice guys
this print that this is really cute
business it's one of those playing
pieces and this would even go nice with
that oversized jean jacket that I have
and maybe sneakers you're getting a reco
sneakers this is curved
now the next sweater just I got is size
1416 and I'm not sure how I picked these
items out so for this sweater dress it
was a little oversized for me so what I
had to do with the sweater dresses that
have to attach a belt to it so I added
an accessory belt on to it so that I can
pull up the material when I if you guys
have clothing arms that are too big you
guys know exactly what I'm talking about
so I use the belt to put on the way so
that I could pull the shirt pull the
shirt or the dress up over the belt to
kind of pull the material outward so
that it could like sit on my body well
so you guys will see obviously a ton
well this is also Chuckie neck sweater
dress I love this very sexy and I try to
put the bun on when it's two and a
bunless Sochi with it very very sexy it
is a size 1416 so there's a lot of
material I would definitely say wear
this with an accessory belt just because
it'll just save you time and you can
actually shrink the dress up with a belt
which is exactly what I did but this
does show your curls and I notice that
you can see my cheeks in the back when
when I turned around but it's really
nice I would just say we're kind of like
all black bottoms I mean like we're
split underneath just so that you can't
see like anything in the light but I
thought this was super sexy and I just
really like it you can run as a boot or
whatever just make it look really really
cute so I thought that this was great
you got even you can actually even just
whisper sneakers to be honest with you
but overall I thought this was so
freaking sexy and cute so my last item
that I'm going to show you guys
something I'm probably going to wear or
bring with me on my trip which I'm going
on and week and a half and this is just
a basic kind of one of those to prop
dresses I just kept this simple I just
wanted something that was like a
different color I could have got it away
but I'm like Vicodin why it's going to
be fluffed up so I just got like this
khaki colored
tube dress I love to dresses like this
because they really should mess on the
boobs and you don't have to wear a bra
with it it just sits romex on the boobs
and it's long it's a long long dress and
I just picture myself walking on the
beach with it you know the time it's
just just a very simple dress so I just
really liked it and I picked this up I
think this is a size it's a size 1214
and I don't know how they translate this
one but let me yeah I don't know so
that's everything guys I hope that this
video wasn't too too long for you guys I
loved mostly everything that I got I'm
very very happy and I'm like really
loving these charm halls
