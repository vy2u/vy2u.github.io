do a chit chat get ready with me video I
do have somewhere to go later so I'm
trying to get myself situated before I
head out the house so I'm gonna do my
makeup and talk to you guys at the same
time so I'm just gonna get right into it
just to start off I will try to list all
the items down below because you guys
asked me all the time so the first thing
I'm going to use is the NYX HD studio
photogenic primer and it's like kind of
like a creamy white base but I'm gonna
use this on my skin just to kind of get
me nice and photo ready so today's video
is sponsored by best fiends now best

of fiends to defeat slugs by matching
saved colored objects so basically what
I'm gonna do is just match off the same
items like there's like strawberries
mushrooms leaves etc etc now when I was
first introduced to this game I was a
little nervous because I am at a phone
savvy person and I'm definitely not a
game savvy person but this game is super
easy to do guys is super easy to play so
I actually had a really good time
playing this game it was fun and I
wanted to keep going and going and going

it's definitely something to keep you
preoccupied this holiday so as far as my
life goes there's nothing new that's
change guys I take I'm still working and
yesterday I was supposed to post a video
but I had like a Christmas part of the
day before and all these other events so
I kind of like drifted into party mode
and stuff like that I still have like a
whole bunch of other Christmas parties
to attend to that's for work and stuff
like that cuz if you guys know I work
like seven different jobs like I just
per diem a lot of places and when you're
nurse you can per diem a lot of places
and work so that's what I like to do I
don't like to stay at one place because
I get bored so I like to jump around at
different places one of my main places
that I work is in Pediatrics
so that's kind of like my safety place
and it's just a place that I like to
work at so I go there and that's kind of
what I consider my permanent place
permanent my job in a way you guys do
know that I do that and then I do
nursing and then I do do youtube at the
same time and it's it's just fun but I
am really tired but these are the
commitments that I made I'm still young
this is my golden year so I turned 27 on
December 27 so I'm still young so I'm
able to multitask and do stuff and plus
so you try to make some money you got to
do stuff you know you got to go to work
and YouTube is fun like I always say to
you guys but it's not something that I
consider to be long-term for me it's
good now to kind of get yourself you
know and you know it's a good it's a
good thing to get yourself out there to
kind of create a hobby that you enjoy
and stuff like that and I always say
that on my channel it is definitely fun
people make careers out of this thing
but I always feel like a back-up plan is
always good at the same time too so I'm
happy I did go to school and that I got
my nursing going so that's definitely
good and yeah so I I don't know so I
definitely had a lot to do this I'm like
I'm like changing the subject Lee had a
lot to do one on Thursday and Wednesday
so I definitely didn't have enough time
to film the video I want it and whatever
video that I did film it wasn't to the
quality that I would have liked it to be
so I just said you know what I'm not
gonna give him this video like this
because it's just not it's not the video
that I want to produce or to give to my
subscribers so I just say you know what
we'll do something else so I came today
I do have somewhere to go I have a
surprise birthday party to attend
tonight so I said to myself let me just
do my makeup with them and kind of
update them about what's going on like I
said there's not really that much going
on in my life I'm just doing this doing
work and being tired I really don't get
sleep because in the last few days I've
been working on my website so some of
you guys are asking me to do wig sales
and stuff like that
so I did work on the website and the
website should be going up sometime this
week
but with stuff like that always be traps
with stuff like that you it's a lot of
preparation it's not something you just
say to yourself oh I'm just gonna start
a website out I'm gonna sell my unit
and stuff like that like you have to
think about shipping you have to think
about packaging and like I'm really
particular about design and stuff like
that so I really wanted to make sure
that I got like the proper stuff because
I wanted to send you guys thank-you card
stuff like that for shopping on my
website and stuff like that but I
definitely will announce guys like not
that the day the night no you know
announce of the day before this time
around probably gonna just do a US only
because honestly when you stuff send
stuff out to other countries you have to
go through customs and it's just a lot
of work like I'm and you know I've even
for the giveaways I did one and I had to
send it out overseas it's not even
overseas get overseas whatever you had
to go through customs so it's just a lot
of work and it does cost a lot of money
to send stuff up especially if it's a
big package and stuff like that so those
are things you have to keep into
consideration when doing giveaways
period so if you start trying to start a
channel you want to do giveaways
just keep that stuff into consideration
seeing that I do have like almost
hundred twenty thousand subscribers I
have people that are everywhere some I
realize that to consideration and I do
it's not I'm not saying that I'm not
gonna do a giveaway that's for people
that are far away from the United States
I just have to UM not even giveaways
sell my wigs and stuff like that I just
have to kind of have like a plan because
honestly I don't know if you guys know
this I do this by myself I do have my
best friend Alex helping me out and then
my sister helping me out but they have
their own jobs and my friend is actually
getting her master's and social work
right now so she's really busy and stuff
in it so I can't really rely on them to
kind of help me all the time so I'm
really pretty much doing this by myself
so it's a lot of work on top of going to
school and then producing my every
Wednesday and Friday videos which never
really is Wednesday and Friday I post
videos that maybe like four times a week
just because a lot have a lot of
deadlines to meet so that's why I do
that so yeah so I also want to tell you
guys that this video today is sponsored
so it's basically I just started playing
this game on my phone and it's called
best fiends now I'm not guys I'm not
really someone that's really into stuff
like that my sister's growing up they
were into like a lot of video games and
stuff like
that and I just never was able to get
the knack of video games so when I saw
this game and I got contacted I was like
okay let me try this out even before I
do the video I'm gonna be a hundred
percent honest with you guys I decided
to play the game first by myself to kind
of get it because I'm not gonna come
come on here and lie to you guys so um I
played the game and I was like okay this
is easy and like I said I'm not really a
phone savvy person so the game was
really easy for me to navigate which is
excellent I am traveling a lot this
coming up next year so I wanted to have
like a game or something that I can keep
be preoccupied with on the plane cuz I
am going far I'm traveling a lot out out
of them the United States by then I'm
going to tile in and then I'm going to
Europe and France so I'm doing a lot of
that and those will be within the same
period so I'm going away in March and
I'm going away May and then I'm going
back to Jamaica and I'm just doing a lot
of those things again probably just do
another la you know la trip again too
because that's just what I do every year
it's like my second home I just go there
for the beach and for the fun so you
probably guys will see so next thing I'm
definitely gonna start trying to
incorporate a lot of those types of logs
into my channel just because that's what
I'm gonna be doing mostly I do have a
special video and a boob update because
someone asked me about my breast
implants and stuff like that so I'll be
doing a boob update next month in
January the beginning of next year for
you guys or maybe like towards
mid-february but you guys will have a
special video up for that I know it's
like a random thing to put up but you
guys know I've had plastic surgery
before so I wanted to do that as well
too so I have like a lot I like a lot of
things that I'm doing next year so I
really want to keep you guys so
basically I do my brows and I just put a
little concealer on my lids I'm going to
actually set the concealer on my lids so
that it's not looking mmm I'm ass so I'm
gonna just set them up so if you guys
are interested in my contact lenses you
guys asked me all the time these contact
lenses are actually from panis cocom now
I will link it down below they changed
their website a few times so last time I
posted a video up on this people were
confused because they didn't know where
the website was that so they kind of
like switched up they were on Big Cartel
I believe it is and then they kind of
like I guess to their own site or
whatever so I will link it down below
you guys so you guys know exactly what
website or where these contact lenses
can be purchased these are the Sierra
Browns that I haven't and they're by far
one of my favorite contact lenses
prescription by the way prescription so
people ask me that as well - are those
prescription lenses yes people these are
prescription lenses and originally the
first time the company came out they
were $29.99 somebody did tell me that
their 59.99 now so I guess the
popularity rose a price but they're
definitely very natural-looking and I
get so many compliments people are like
oh your eyes are really nice and I do
like them a lot these are really natural
I did show you guys with the blue ones
look like now the blue ones are cool but
the blue ones for me just don't look
realistic at all so I would just say
stick to these if you have like brown
eyes or like your brother you know like
just you know play play by looks and
you'll think about it that's what I
always say I'm not gonna say you know
you can't go out there with the baby
blue eyes on but just kind of think
about it when you purchase them I will
wear the blue ones like if I'm going
away and I want it like if I'm doing
like a minimalist makeup look and I'm
gonna have like this kind of like
sunkissed look on the beach maybe I'll
bring them to with me to Thailand or
something like that but it's not
something that I particularly like just
be like busting out the house with just
because they don't look real and it just
throw you throw you off a little bit and
what kind of like clash with your own
beauty you know what I'm saying like
these right here to enhance your beauty
and they don't clash too much so I
definitely think that these are
definitely one to purchase like honestly
like and everyone talks about the
solidity contact lenses the okra ones Oh
gray these are actually similar to the
okra but these to me kind of look a
little bit bit better they don't have
that ring light around the ring ring
light Wow
they don't have that limbo ring around
them so therefore it kind of like melts
into your eyes and gives you more of
like this pixelated look which I do like
so I'm just adding the LA girls
concealer and toffee on under is this
toffee
yeah I'm adding toffee and I'm actually
gonna add another color on it too so I'm
gonna add let's see what this one is I'm
gonna add almond now almond is a little
bit lighter but it gives you like the
type of highlight you want I still want
to add highlight on
later on it's just no highlight or
highlight I highlight like what is this
conceal why am I saying dumb stuff so
when I conceal a definite thing it makes
me look a little bit more glammy
so I'm just gonna conceal these little
areas right here just to give myself a
little bit more of a look so I'm gonna
set this up and buff it out for you guys
and you guys will see what it looks like
so I'm gonna just buff this out so you
guys can see how the concealer is now
the concealer let it sit a little bit
for a little bit a few minutes just
because I want it to kind of like soak
in or kind of like really kind of get
into my skin Oh
embarrassing so I don't be like la girls
when I la girls first came out they were
a dollar ninety-nine yo that price rose
so much these are like two three dollars
nine to nine they're 399 I'm like I'm
not paying three dollars for a four
dollar for this when this first came out
people wasn't even on it like I was
paying nothing but as popularity Rises
and in product becomes in demand
I guess these companies really feel like
I can raise the prices on these these
mofos real quick so the price definitely
rose ooh what the hell I'm gonna have to
I'm gonna know more i'ma fix that so as
the company got popular and the prices
decided to rise so that's definitely
like annoying because it's like all the
real people that were there when you
guys first start out this is how you
repay us oh my god but yeah but I like
girls they do have some good stuff I'm
also gonna show you guys um when I
actually contour this out to kind of
bring out this word ashy look I'll show
you guys one of their powders that I use
it's actually a face powder but I don't
use it as a face powder just because
it's a little too dark so I used that
one as a contour pattern powder I got it
from I kick house when I did a haul for
IKEA house in the summertime and when I
saw on the website I initially thought I
always go for the darker color because
I'm afraid so I went for the darkest
color and obviously the darkest color
was too dark so I use it as a contour
and actually works pretty good so that's
one thing I like and actually I thought
my makeups turning on right now it's
like really matte looking it's not um
that's oily and you guys can see the
highlight just kind of really turns the
whole entire look completely different
so I hope you guys can see
so I took up a headscarf so I just go
down the baby here's a little bit with
this one so this week is the wig that I
custom colored from RPG hair and I
absolutely love this Auburn orange color
guys it's so pretty like I get so many
compliments on this like it's so nice so
for tonight I'm gonna wear this wig I
would sell this wig but I love it so
much and I kind of feel like if I
attempt to color it like this again it's
not gonna come out the way it should be
or it's not gonna come out like this
especially because the way that they set
me was a strawberry blonde mix color so
I'd have to get another unit that's kind
of like a strawberry blonde mix in order
to get this one to look the same way so
I'm kind of like saying to myself I'm
not going through all that if you want
to create a unit like this and you can
go ahead and purchase those items
yourself to create this unit so I'm just
going to go in and have and add some
powder just to set this up and then I'm
going to come in contour for you guys
right guys so I'm gonna use a little bit
of the Sasha buttercups
Sasha buttercups Sasha buttercup mixed
with the graftobian powder as well so
the graftobian one that I use is
buttercream banana cream and then the
Sasha one I guess it's only one color
I'm not sure I don't even know what to
do with the pad but I'm gonna use those
and mix them together just this
definitely gives you like this orange II
kind of look but I'm gonna try to bust
this one the right way so I'm gonna set
the concealer first cuz the under eye
crease is so fast like I kind of think I
waited too long to conceal I'm to set
but the under eye crease is a lot so I'm
gonna set the under eye first and the
under eye that I said I'm also gonna set
like right here at the top where
concealed a little bit as well - and
then my chin area down here and then I'm
going to go in and can do the contour I
also do right here where the nose is
that because this is a part where I get
really oily at this little Crescent
crease so I'm gonna cut I'm gonna powder
there as well - and what uh people were
looking at so I'm gonna do that so I'm
gonna let this sit while I go in with my
la girls port prophase now this is a
common tongue on this one was a little
bit too dark so I'm gonna use this as a
contour powder instead that looks
something - hey
happens I hate when I film something
that I realized after that I have this
humongous booger in my nose that's so
embarrassing but as a part of keeping it
real on here I'm not gonna edit that
part out like I don't know something's
like tickling my nose right now but I'm
gonna use this little angle brush that
I'm going to contour so I start here and
I come down I'm not a professional guys
this is just this is just Dom's way of
doing stuff but you can already see that
line came through and as I say it was a
little bit too dark so it works out
perfect I am gonna show you guys how I
do my perfect little lip combo that you
guys are always asking me for them like
the colors I do on my lips I will
definitely incorporate that into this
video as well
so this part that was a little bit like
funny-looking I'm gonna contour the top
areas well too so that could just bring
in a little bit more color on the top
here so it's not looking too Caste
looking some I feel like this is working
up he one thing this is working you see
that you see that face coming through
yes I do like makeup guys but I do like
regular videos that I do like my hair
video so here videos are definitely
different since I started adding colored
hair videos like doing like a lot of
colors and stuff like that I noticed
that you guys are really receptive to
that so I'm trying to do more of that
coloring here it's definitely a process
and just so I am doing the affordable
hair serious things too so you guys will
get some affordable hair videos this
week so you guys will see some of those
as well too so I'm definitely gonna try
to give you guys a lot of holiday glam
so I hope you guys appreciate that and I
want to say thank you to everybody who
has watched my videos and who have
supported me anyways despite anything
that you guys don't like that I do like
I know you guys say I used to cost a lot
I actually really just kind of recently
realized that I've really chilled out
with stuff like that anyways like I used
to cuss a lot and it wasn't something I
was doing intentionally it's just like
you know that's just how I am
it's not a Connecticut thing or anything
like that because everybody here is too
proper but um it was just something that
I was I don't know just it's just I
don't know I don't know but I'm not a
fake person so I keep it a hundred
percent all the time that's just how I
was so there you go guys and this is
what it's looking like someone let it
set come back wipe it
and then reload so I'm just gonna wipe
this off guys and I'm just gonna get it
off all ah you can kind of see like
those harsh lines in here so then I'm
gonna show you guys how I do my lip
combination cuz you guys always ask me
and I know it's kind of ridiculous with
someone to do like six different type of
lip colors mixed together to get a look
but honestly I feel like that's the best
type of look there's not one lipstick
that you're gonna like so I feel I feel
like when I mix my lipsticks together I
get like the definitive look that I like
so that's why you guys see me oh wow
this looks really pretty well I like
this sash of water clap it looks nice
you guys can see how my face is coming
off oh girl
like this well baby here's a little
fragile there but it's okay cuz I'm
doing like a little Cascade of being
anyways so it's not gonna be that much
of a difference I hate how the light
changes so much when you do like it's
the slightest movements but I do like
this so I'm just gonna go in with my
pressed powder again just so that I can
really buff it and I don't want it to
look you know
cry-cry or whatever cuz you're probably
I mean I girl you have no look I'm just
gonna go in with my um this one that
uses the Maybelline fit me 360 powder
and I usually use Maybelline anyway it's
just because I like the way Maybelline
is mattes up
they say it's matte but it's not really
matte but it does the job so that's why
I like it you guys to see that so let's
get into the lipstick those lips is all
but just start off by using tall from
color pops and I just use it a little
bit just to do a few lines in it so a
few lines in just a few dots of it into
there cuz the colors really strong and I
didn't realize it was that strong to
like now then this color came out like
two three years ago so then I'm gonna go
in with Lolita which is one of my
favorites lipsticks so I'm gonna mix
Lolita in with toe so I know you guys
are like girl why are you mixing all
these things together cuz this is just
how I do it
hello so then I'm gonna smack that
together and I think I lost my other lip
gloss my lava lipstick honestly
oh no it's right on the floor let me get
it for you let me get it before I move
on so I'm also gonna
you thanks so I'm also going to use it
like fall on the ground so I'm also
going to use my Milani which is also one
of my favorites as well too so I'll use
the Milani and this is covet by Milani
so this is like a chocolate brown matte
lip club lipstick like a lipstick when I
kind of use it like as the overall base
for my lips and this one actually works
good and I thought you guys would hear
background stuff I'm actually watching
something on TV now I actually do my
makeup and watching at least like like a
little TV show or something so that's
why you guys probably hear that
but I hope you guys don't hear so I'm
gonna just put this on and automatically
as I'm doing this my lips already
matting up so this is the color that I
like so what I do go and do now is I use
the wet and wild color a pencil lip
pencil or eyebrow pencil and I use Brown
and I just kind of go around the edges
and really really buff it out so that's
how I get like that kind of like harsh
kind of like nude ma flip not needed ma
flip so this is signature lip guys I
wear this all the time there's no way
that anyone can pull me off this lip
combination I'll do Reds and stuff like
a like deep berry cuz but this is my
favorite color by far so I do this all
the time so let's see mm-hmm
you guys can see how rich that looks
like look at that and even if you mess
up a little bit I just use my concealer
brush and I just clean it up if I could
find it I'd be great but I can't so what
I'm going to do is put my lashes on I'm
gonna come back because I'm gonna do
something with liner but I'm gonna try
to do that color line at this time you
guys see that I'll do blue liner
sometimes I do like different colored
greens and stuff like that so I'm gonna
do a car liner because I think that this
hair will go look good but kind of like
an electric highlighter electric liner
so I'm gonna do like a color liner with
this look I definitely like the hair I
think the hair looks good for today's
look with kind of like a simple eye and
like a nice regular lash I think it'll
look good so I'll be right back guys I'm
gonna put the lashes on and I'll be back
alright guys so I just went in and add a
little bit more powder underneath
because I felt like I was cruising up a
little bit I did change my top to this
kind of like green sweatshirt type of
top I just think the color green
and I did tell you guys it's gone too
like a little bit of a green liner so
I'm going to use the Jordana ez liner
for eyes and it's basically like a green
color I want to do that because I feel
like the orange hair with the eyes will
pop really nice with green so I'm just
gonna add some orange orange on some
green light on the bottom of my eyelid
on the walk bottom of my what am I
saying right now on my waterline let's
see how this turns out
yeah I like that a lot so we're gonna do
some both sides and I think that this
one just give it a little bit more of a
it'll kind of bring in the or the Auburn
or orange here I don't even know what to
call this is it a burn here or orange
here just don't know what so then I'm
gonna go in with a little bit of
eyeshadow just to - it a little bit so
I'm gonna fast for the rest of this
video and I'll come back to you guys
with the finished look and I'll tell you
guys exactly how much
Oh
alright guys so this is the finished
look of today's chit chat get ready with
me video I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I like doing these videos kind of
sporadic throughout my channel it is
holiday season so if you're looking for
like a nice holiday glam look I think
that this one can pass as a holiday glam
I do love the concept of the green eyes
and then this auburn hair and then even
adding the pop of this orange blush on
my cheeks has really brought the look
together so I'm really really feeling
myself right now and I really really
like this look so I hope that you guys
enjoyed this video guys do not forget to
