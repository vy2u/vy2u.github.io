going to be a curvy girl chan-ho and
this hall sponsored to you guys by a
company called zap fool calm and I'll be
featuring some accessory swimwear and
clothing items so if you're interested
in seeing what i dr you guys today i
want you to stay tuned and keep on
signing up this video i'm going to start
with some of the sweater kind of items
that I got the first thing that guys is
really cool sweater and it says dirty
hippie on it and it just tastes like
your basic sweatshirt I like too because
I don't really have a lot of sweatshirt
so I wanted to give some it a little bit
more relaxed so I can just do casual
outfit of the days and stuff like that
so if the blacks Lennon has white riding
and it says dirty hippie I just like
it's really nice and sick little kind of
cool screen t sweater type of situations
this is in a size 2 XL it fits pretty
good I like it you can wear with jeans
or wear with whatever and make it look
really good you can also dress it up i
wearing like a nice leather jacket so
i'm over the knee heel both in some
leggings if you want to make it like
slightly casual and slightly like put
together i think that this is really
cute and like the whole dirty hippie
thing just you can really go crazy what
like your makeup in your hair style with
this type of style you love saying guys
so i really like this one is the size 2x
the next thing i have is this kind of
like sweater it looks like a sweater
dress now i'm going to say this about
this sweater dress it doesn't really
come off as a sweater dress reasons
because it is short now some people can
be risky and want to wear this and then
get away with it but if you're curvy
like I am you're not going to give it
away with this the nice way so you just
been out pouring like some skinny jeans
or some leggings with this and then
wearing looks casual kicks so this is
what it looks like it has like a nice
detailing on the top front right here
and the detail task also continues down
at the side right here as well
it does have kind of these white
strengths of this little kind of silver
tassel at the end just to give a little
bit of character and it is all black
with minimal pockets the pockets are
deep pockets they're kind of like little
pockets which are cool now this is in
the size 2x as well now this one fits
two ex-wives I guess I feel like it
could have been a little bit bigger but
the problem with this one is it's short
so I would
recommend wearing this as a dress if
you're curvy or if you're tall or yeah I
would just recommend wearing this at
kinda a hoodie oversized shirt with
leggings but I really like it and if I
was risky enough I would but it's too
damn cold out here to be trying to be
all extra sexy but it's really nice and
I really like it the next thing I get I
got doubles of it just because I was
like the concept these were supposed to
be drafted but they ended up being kind
of like sweaters
now I've had in two colors I got one in
the like this nice kind of gray color
and it's kind of burnt orange color
now the gray one fits really really nice
it's not too big and these are the size
extra large these are way these are like
overly big the gray ones over the big
before somebody's in the burnt orange
one is kind of big the gray one I could
wear pull off a jeans and be fine with
they're like leggings I really like it
it's like when those de-stress type of
flares is it's like a lot of holes in
the front the front part and the side
part and it just has kind of a nice
collar right here where you can wear
like a nice choker with it to kind of
like jazz it up a little bit which I
really like about this the orange one is
nice as well - I love the orange color
there's my skin tone so I feel like this
looks really really good but the problem
with this one is billick it's really
really big and they're both the size
extra large but the orange one just has
a little bit more pull to it one thing I
would say about these is that these will
snag against stuff and you'll get kind
of like unraveling of the threat of the
thread so just be careful when you like
go against sharp or like pointy items
will kind of pull and it will snag this
the threading but I really like these
are very comfortable sweater it's very
warm and they look really good and
stylish for an in-season wear and also I
really really really really like these
items right here so the next two items
and it is starting a distance cream
cheese that I got I've been into the
screen tea thing and I like crazy I love
cream cheese they just say solid thing
and just get the message right out there
this one is cute and it kind of goes
with my hat that I have on today this
one says 90s on it's just a white
t-shirt and it says 92 black letters I
just like this onboard 1990s so I just
thought the school goals read along with
me describes me to a tee now the problem
with this one which I didn't notice
until after is that they sent me this
one and in size small about four summers
it's like a small t-shirt style with you
tonight be careful because these Chinese
based website so excite small could have
been like this little-ass crop top this
sub leg right here but this one actually
fit really good so I was really really
pleased with this one it's just kind of
t-shirt size and decide small so we
don't warden just make sure you
correctly order this stuff right or I
didn't accidentally sent this to me I
mean I honestly put the orders in the
way I knew my size was but what ask but
identify semana fit so I'm going where
the next one that I got is this black
one and it has weight riding on it and
it says this cute little logo it says
Pablo and the only reason why I like
this one so much is because I have a dog
and my dog my dog's name is Pablo my
boyfriend name is all cobble and it is
so cute so I got this one on just
because I really thought like though
it's just so cute and I could just wear
it like you know I probably would on
Valentine's Day Zico look at I got
something for you this is what I'm
wearing for Valentine's Day
wow that's not an extra fucking corny I
just thought it was really cheesy and
cute especially because the dog's name
is Pablo so I'm representing him as
Pablo's mom so I really like this and
you know you can just wear it any type
of way just something cute so the next
thing that I got works in swimwear and
I'm sure you guys that I also pick stuff
up the floor for fact if you don't shit
all over the place okay so the next
thing I was in swimwear now I got two o
bikinis now these are curvy girl
plus-size girl-friendly bathing suits
now the first I'm going to show you guys
is this scuba type and I wasn't you guys
can hear as I'm wrestling around with it
it's like a scuba material bikini little
high-waisted bikini set both of these
are high waisted so this is the first
one it's like really cute like this nice
orange color if you are a cocoa color
girl like me orange and like yellows
look really good on a succession like
the summer time like if you're going to
like a nice tropical beach I'm going
away from Valentine's Day so I've been
just to be so cute and is that this
orange scuba collar this one has stretch
in it but the problem with me as I'm
very dumb bottom-heavy
so like like the bottom part is like
really cheeky like if you're cheeky
you're going to have like a lot of extra
you can have like a little a lot of
extra munchkin rolls come up
side of the thing but for me I really
don't care I still think it looks cute
it's always nice and sexy to have a
little bit of fat hanging out I don't
know whether your stats is not or they
you know like you all automatic think
that girls wear bikinis like
high-waisted thing whatever kind of cut
things that have to be like really lean
and whatever I still feel like it looks
really sexy if you have like a little
bit of fat hanging out so so I think
this is cute and I really like it
I just come with the bikini tops of the
keto it was a little bit large for me I
did have to adjust the straps too but I
do like the whole concept of this kind
of like boxy uniform look this is one of
my favorite videos well I only got two
in both of them are my favorite because
they're both great I really like this
one a lot the next thing I got was kind
of like that African Explorer inspired
tribal bottom some bikini um
high-waisted bikini set now this one is
really cute too guys in this one gosh
this is great now the other thing too I
thought was in a size large and this one
is in size large I could have swore that
I ordered these in Excel because I was
trying to be careful with the
accessories abundance but for some
reason the company sent these to me in
large what asked they said but like I
said when it comes to these little side
cage parts on these waiting suits I do
have little chocolate munchkin rolls
coming out the side which like I said I
don't care oh my god sweet okay well
once I have like little munchkin donor
will come out the side but I really like
these I think it's really sexy and it's
like really Afrocentric oh my god
oh my god I've excused mwah
now here's a bikini top the bikini
bikini top is a little bit big but you
just have to adjust it the top it does
come with like that middle boob string
part right here which they're like okay
oh my god and you know I woke up saw the
video but I'm not because that's just uh
be too much god I said I'm allergic to
the damn dog
Pablo gotta go okay so this sounds like
this cute little adjustable area right
here so I sent me not just what happens
this cute little design like that like
middle boob center parts of a splitter
and I just liked it a lot I think this
point too is rocking I'm definitely
killing when I go to dr with my honey so
I already told my husband to babysit a
zombie height so the next thing is that
I got at sector II have to do custom
accessories in this haul because I just
saw systems on these reviews haul
reviews I might as well add some
accessories and a why not something to
say that the scenes look like I'm not
really gonna try them on because you
guys might know what these things look
like so this is the kind of choker style
where you slip the strings inside a hole
and you kind of adjust it towards to
your neck I thought this was really cute
I have a fat neck a little fat gobble
down there so I probably won't have
these adjusted too tightly because I
don't want to suffocate but I really
like this it's kind of like a velvet
material looks kinda like a Belton is it
a velvety and I think it's cool so I'm
definitely attracted when I thought this
was pretty cold I think what's really
cheap just lets you know everything will
be listed down below for you guys so
don't fret don't be worried everything
will be down below so the next one I got
is kind of that cool little string one I
don't even know how to put this on I'm
gonna have to watch or like youtube how
to put these on because I have no clue
now this one has like these little gold
tassels at the bottom of it and I'm a
gold fanatic I love gold accessories so
I guess this one you just tied double
waves around and then just tie the
strings whatever way it is I'll figure
it out a number racquet but I really
thought this was cute so I definitely I
think it this one and these are really
cheaper so the next thing I got were a
couple rings there's like a ring set and
I saw these little rings are cute listen
up fashion rings like I said I'm going
away for Valentine's Day and I just
bring these accessories with me just for
like dinner and stuff like that
nothing major just actually things for
me to go on my trip with and I just
thought it was a perfect opportunity to
get these items since I was doing all
any goddamn way so these are the Rings
they're just really simple rings of this
is my ring right here this is the ring
on top like you kind of knuckle rings
and then like this cute little hearts
would be perfect for Valentine's and
stuff like that size babies are cool and
this is really inexpensive too so I
definitely had to let me try to feature
my nails up a hair yes girl
but I thought this was totally cool so I
got these two and yes so that I lie to
have one more item for you guys
so the last item I'm going to show you
guys is this dress oh my god like the
custom stuff is video of boy so the last
item I got is it's really cool kind of
simple dress I only bought it because I
really liked the stripes on the dress
I thought the structure kind of cool
especially because I like a lot of black
and white sneakers I could just pair it
with so I picked up this dress
I got it excites excellent I probably
should've downsize to maybe like a
larger and medium just because it's a
little bit oversized but what I ended up
thinking I was going to do with this
dress is wear this as a cover-up for my
trip just because it's kind of like
loose it's a little C to Durham a little
see-through so I probably just save it
to my trip and just wear it like when
I'm going to the beach or like if we're
going to do an excursion or something
like that just for fun now it does have
like little pockets on the side on the
front here and what you could just add
like some change or whatever or like
whatever you want to put inside pockets
it's very loose and slowly which I like
but like I said it is a little bit
see-through so I probably say this like
if I'm going on like a beach ship or
something that like we're going to do an
excursion during the day when I go to dr
so yeah so now this finally wraps up the
review these are all the items that I
got I'm very satisfied with this company
I think times are gray and I think it
looked great so I'm really excited about
the things I chose I do have some more
haul videos coming up for you dr. guys
are interested I absolutely love doing
Harvey's not just because it's fun I was
so used to doing the videos in the hair
of you as a makeup tutorial and I still
love doing those too so I'm going to
continue doing both and kind of
multitasking at the same time but I
think I'm doing pretty well guys what do
