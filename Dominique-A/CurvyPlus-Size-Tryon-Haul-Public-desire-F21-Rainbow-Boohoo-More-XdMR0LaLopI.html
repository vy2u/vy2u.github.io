going to be one of those fun haul videos
again so I wanted to come and talk to
you guys before it to the Harvey do just
to give you guys some insight about what
I'm doing for my channel so I'll be
doing more lookbook and haul videos and
for my channel just because I noticed
that you guys really like those videos
and this is kind of more base for
plus-size curvy girl or average girl
sizes my size varies depending on where
I'm shopping and what kind of material
the clothes are so I could I'm kind of
like in variations with sizes so that's
the kind of cool thing because this
video could be met for anyone so in this
video we'll be showing you guys a lot of
the items that are recently been buying
in this video I did add some thrifted
items and some items I borrowed for my
boyfriend's closet and I did add some
shoe accessories or shoes in this video
as well so this video probably a little
bit longer than my usual hair tutorials
and stuff like they're my makeup
tutorials but hey it's closed so um yeah
so I'm going to jump into the video and
show you guys all the items that I got
make sure you leave all your comments
down below for me thumbs up this video

mark and I want to thank you for to
everyone say thank you to everyone for
subscribing to my channel and supporting
me through this YouTube journey it's
very wonderful to see how much people
aren't influenced by the things that
I've brought out to you brought to you
guys so I think that's really nice and I
want to say thanks so furthermore just
stay tuned and keep online so jumping
right into this video I'm going to start
off with t.j.maxx
I do enjoy shopping on t.j.maxx it's
just one of my favorite places to shop
at they usually every Friday I think as
my sister used to work there every
Friday they usually have like new
inventory Thursday and forgot with Davis
but they usually have a new inventory a
lot so I go there a lot I'm just
unraveling this shirt because I actually
wear this shirt already and I love it so
this is the first item I got for them
and it's one of those basically like um
big neck wide neck kind of tops and
obviously the neck is kind of like one
of those large neck tops this is a size
large and it you can actually cut a
little see-through but it is actually
pretty nice it's a long style shirt this
was about 16 dollars for this shirt 1699
but it is a really nice khaki color I
just like it the sleeves are very nice
on this item
well the thing that's told me more on
this shirt is to cop the neck the neck
my neck collar is actually very very
fluffy and nice so I really thought this
would be cute just wear with jeans and
stuff and like maybe ugg boots just like
a very simple look when you're trying to
style anything up I just thought it was
a nice like kind of like a comfy
sweatshirt or sweater to wear so that's
why I picked this one out so the second
item I got is this cute little far
jacket it's not even a jacket it's a
huge first style jacket I absolutely
love this I actually got this in
extra-large I don't even know I got an
extra large I think I was going for more
of that big big big fluffy look but I
mean it looks good it is a little big
but I'm still gonna rock it the way I
want it does have pockets on the side
right here which is really good and it's
almost like a sheep's jacket I just
really really love this guys it's like
so big and has a flappy collar right
here which makes it look really cool
this will probably styled more the thing
about I live in Connecticut so it's kind
of like when people like see walking
around with stuff like the dick I'm like
oh my god girl like this is not New York
saying you don't need to get all
fashion-forward and stuff like that but
that's the cool thing about being able
to be yourself wherever you live and do
whatever you want I really don't care
I'm going to wear this and I'm going to
wear this the right way and well even if
I wear it with sweatpants I'm going to
wear it guys I just think this is a
really nice item just having your closet
especially when it thought the colder
days you could put like a nice like
sweater underneath it or long-sleeved
shirts and jeans in like black booties
and I think will be really cute so I
definitely picked this up and I know
it's a little bit outrageous but I like
it a lot guys and this is about 25
dollars so yeah so the next items that I
have and I'm like gonna have to get off
the floor are a couple of items are
rainbow I have rainbow on my town this
actually they're actually closing it
down so they're gonna have a huge sale
so get ready for one of those big
forever
rainbow hauls because they're actually
having a sale right now and they're
actually getting made a lot of stuff but
these items I picked up way before
they're they're closing day they're
closing hole shenanigan so I'm a
turtleneck fan I love turtlenecks
obviously as you can see from the first
door this is a turtleneck shirt I'm
probably not going to try this on
because I don't want to ruin it but you
guys get the gist of a turtleneck this
is a size medium shirt it's a
long-sleeve white turtleneck shirt and
it's kind of ripped this was about $7.99
you can't go wrong with turtlenecks I
blacked when I was great turtlenecks
green turtlenecks I just I like the look
of the other shuttle neck like kind of
hiding my neck yeah but I always have to
get turtlenecks in wintertime so I
picked up a white one because I already
had different colors so the next items
that got there are two of the same items
I just got one in black and one in this
burgundy color which I love so these are
basically kind of like those throw over
cardigans they share our sweaters
now cardigan throw overs whatever the
thing I like about this one it does have
like a little peekaboo slit right here
which is Q so it kind of like they
really kind of accentuate your curves
because it'll split off right where that
kind of curve on your hips is so it kind
of gives you that kind of like it gives
you like more of a curvy look so I
really like that it is kind its ribbed
and it is a little bit see-through but
this is not something I would just
suggest wearing when it's like 42
degrees outside if it's like a 65 degree
they're 61 degree day and December which
it seems like it's going to be soon I
would say you can wear this with like a
long t-shirt underneath it or even
putting a scarf on with it to wear it
with style it so I got this in Burgundy
and I also got this in black which you
know black goes with everything so I had
to get me a black one as well too these
are both a size large and I got these
for 12000 99 cents I just think these
are really cute things just to put on to
kind of make an outfit look a little bit
better so I always buy stuff like this
so the next thing I got was from forever
21 now I only have one end for for
Robert 21 this time no I got two items
from forever 21 but I just go with the
clothes first and I'll show you guys the
shoes after so this is just a very
simple dress that I got from forever 21
it is kind of one of those sweater
dresses now this one is kind of like it
goes over then it goes past the knees so
I'd really like that
and this is a really nice burgundy color
which kind of matches my hair so I
probably would not really wear this with
this wig I probably just wear with a
black unit I got this in a size medium
and it's kind of one of those
form-fitted body con dresses and it
really makes your body look really
really really really really really on
point I did wear this to like a
fundraiser a fundraiser party for Haiti
and it was just like it was like I was
just you know I was feeling myself in it
was really cute and just have kind of
quarter length sleeve so if you want to
wear like a leather jacket with this
would be really nice
to jazz it up a little bit but I do like
this dress a lot guys and it's a size
medium and I think I purchased this
about like sixteen dollars which is not
bad for forever 21 the next item I got
is actually from H&amp;amp;M and this I'm not
sure how much for how much this was but
this was just a plain blazer that I got
it is kind of like the Thanksgiving and
Christmas season right now so I was
looking for like some type of salvaged
jacket that I can get and this is a
jacket that I picked up it's like a very
oranjee jacket I just really really like
it it's not one of those really big
Blazers the padding inside it's a little
bit on the thinner side but it does a
job when you need to let you can layer
it off with a sweater underneath and
wear some jeans and some booties it
would just look really really good and
the thing about this this color for the
complements my skin tone so I just
thought it was great this is actually in
a UK it's actually in a US size 12 and I
actually would I I got this just because
I was like okay let me just get
something and use it which things like
this my arms are kind of I see my arms
look skinny but my arms do I used to
have a hard time putting my arms and
things like this especially things that
don't have stretch but this one actually
didn't give me a problem I just got in
the UK at the u.s. 12 because I was like
ah whatever you know and I don't like my
clothes to be too too tight unless it's
a dress but I just didn't want it to be
too tight so I got in the u.s. 12 and I
loved it guys I think this was about 20
bucks it's a perfect color perfect kind
of like peace to just kind of get your
outfit a little bit more of a stylish
look I just this is just it guys this is
it it fit it so the next few items that
I got these are some items that are
thrifted so I got these jeans from the
goodwill and these are kind of like mom
inspired jeans if you're looking for mom
inspired jeans now they're expensive oh
I like on a sauce they're like $50 and
I'm just kind of like bitch I don't pay
that much money for jeans point-blank
period if I'm shopping up fashion over I
get like a pair of jeans for $30 and get
like 25% off okay that's a deal you know
I'm saying well I got a sauce you're
looking at jeans are mom jeans that are
like frickin $50 $70 I'm not doing that
so that could just be dumb because I'm
not about to do that so I got these that
are kind of mom inspired jeans and these
kind of these are gap blue jeans don't
even ask me the size because the size
the tag on the size has kind of worn out
from washes so whatever but these are
about like $10 I don't know not $10 or
like $5 at the goodwill yeah but like $5
at the goodwill which I thought was a
steal so I absolutely picked these up
these are kind of like they have like
the kind of like top hot glue back
pockets like this and I have like a
curvier in the backside so I do have
that kind of like a bum
so these are the kind of pants that you
wear and it's kind of they come up high
around my waist my waist is small so
they come up high around my waist and
then you can see like you know look you
guys will see I wanna show you guys clip
but they kind of make you look a little
you know boom boom you know like that
kind of look so mm-hmm girl you know I'm
saying so the bottom of the jeans are
kind of like a little tight I usually
cuffed them up because I usually like to
wear like these pants were like heels
and you know try to start up like I
don't know I just have like this open
mind I like this this look in my mind
you know guys I don't know this like
look at my mom like I want to wear stuff
so you can wear these with jeans I mean
you can wear this with seal sneakers and
stuff like that I just think this is
good you'll see sometimes I like to pair
stuff like that off with like a little
belts but I have a hard time finding
belts for my waist I don't know why but
this would be nice to be paired off with
like a new a cute little belt on the top
and then you know where like maybe like
a body suit or something looking all
good so yeah so that's that so the next
items that I got these items are
actually from boohoo calm eyes Shep on
boo calm quite often the only thing
about boo boo it's very kind of tricky
with boo calm cuz you don't know what
you're gonna get so I usually like to
look at the the material before like you
could look at the details for the
material before you actually purchase it
so I've got two tops and I got a dress
so this is kind of like an off the
shoulder dress that I got and I got this
in a US size 10 this is a really nice
dress guys I just thought it was cute to
wear to like me like a bot a baby shower
that I have a baby shower first birthday
first year birthday party that I have
one of my friends it's an off the
shoulder top dress and it's kind of
peachy color you can see these cute
little sleeves right here and the dress
is pretty short guys I know my sister
like was like to me you cannot wear that
but I like it these buttons on here
actually fake button so they are not
real buttons guys so um that's cool cuz
you don't have to worry about peekaboo
boobs coming out I probably just wear
this with a band Oh anyway so that my
boobs don't kind of like y'all boom boom
pointing out at the world so I'm I think
this is really nice it's something you
could really pair out for just any type
of um blazer or duster jacket I thought
it was really cute so I pick this up and
I went down the price of that below I
don't remember off the top of my head so
I got a body suit from them and it's
like please going to those screen t body
suits I absolutely think that this is so
cute guys I really really like this a
lot Allah Allah and this is really the
only reason why I really like this it
has a little snap ons on the bottom
which makes it like look really awesome
so it does snap at the bottom with the
like the loop snap snappers and it's
really this is like really really cute
guys now this is a Guns and Roses styled
basically a onesie what I call this up
yeah onesie I believe whatever um
bodysuit so it's a Guns and Roses ones
in the screen t it's a very nice
material it is a thong styled frickin a
bodysuit
and the thing I was thinking about this
like I'm supposed to I'm going on
vacation um for Valentine's Day so I was
thinking that I would wear this as a
bathing suit I'm all I'm really I know
this is like so out there like down why
do you have to say this but I'm really
into like the cheeky bathing suits like
I like like the thong style bathing
suits I don't care like I think that's I
like the whole Brazilian like bathing
suit type of look thing so I think that
this would look really cute like as a
like a thong style bathing suit I
definitely wear this as a bathing suit
like who said that you can wear a body
suit as a bathing suit well I'm going to
but I do wear this I just all this with
jeans and stuff but I think this is
really cute with the leather jacket and
some kicks I just think this is cute
this is about 10 bucks the next item
that I got was this cute t-shirt it's
kind of like an oversized t-shirt and I
got this in the size large and it is
supposed to be an oversized t-shirt and
it says girl gang I just thought that
this was really dope and be something
really cute to style up I just I don't
know like you can wear this with adidas
or like you know Air Force Ones or
something like that just thought it was
a really cute top to kind of style up so
I was interested in so much that I
bought it guys and
like buoy walls has good sales so this
is five like fifty percent off so I put
this up like seven bucks I thought this
was great so the next things I'm going
to show you guys are some shoes the
first place I'm going to show you the
shoes from is forever 21 like I said
have I mentioned this I have bigger
thighs and wider calf so it's hard for
me to find shoes that are over the knee
that will actually fit my thighs so I
picked up these boots from forever 21
and they're just flat top over the knee
boots you know you can't go wrong with
these type of boots I've already worn
them guys so they're like really flat
boots but the thing about these that
have a zip in the inside they're very
basic style boots but the thing that
sold me is that they are super duper
stretchy so the thing about this that
you can wear these over jeans you can
wear them just with a dress the only
thing I see with this problem with this
one that they keep rolling down off my
leg so I probably have to wear jeans
with it and stuff like that that will
prevent it from rolling down but I do
like these a lot and I'm so happy that I
finally found boots that will fit over
my knees because I also want to be sexy
sometimes to people so I thought that
these were excellent and these are about
$30 so the nice place I bought some
shoes from with public desire and I got
two pairs of shoes from public desire
obviously I've worn these already so
these boots are the Arya boots and these
are kind of platform style booties I
really like stuff sound like this my
friends always make fun of me like oh
you're always looking like gothic or
like like you always go for that kind of
edgy edgy look but these are the things
I do I'm the type or size to switch
upper style a lot like sometimes I like
to look like you know like pretty
princess type and then sometimes I just
like to be really grungy and really like
oh but that's just how I am
um I've always been like that so these I
got these these are the re and these run
in the UK size 7 which means it's in the
US size 9 these are really cute guys I
got these turn about 40 bucks and
they're really comfortable they have a
great grip so you're not going to be
slipping and sliding all over the place
and they look really hot on if you saw
them with like a miniskirt
if you saw them with jeans and just I
just really really like this it gives
you kind of like that really grungy you
know power woman look so I really really
am in love with these boots the next
book I got from public desire actually
just got them in the mail the other day
these boots are the over the knee boots
as well again
but these have a heel on them so these
are kind of heels these are three and a
half inch heels I'm not going to play
myself and make a sea magnet could wear
those 4 or 5 inch heels because that's
not something I can do I'm a little too
top and bottom heavy that I cannot be
wearing them little ass freaking little
sticky leg heel so I respect myself and
get black heels just because if I want
to run a mile on these I can and if you
think you can run around the little ass
heels and so be it but I know that
that's something I can do so I respect
myself and I wear heels that have black
heels like that and three and a half
inches is perfect for me it just have
like a little of a box shape in the
front but I do like them they're very
sexy and they do make that little click
click noise when you walk and these also
are stretchy as well as you guys can see
you can see the detail right here which
shows you that is stretchy so that's a
good plus I just have an inside zip
right here and yeah
so that basically wraps up the video
guys I think I went through everything
that I got sorry that the light kept
coming in and out in this video this
thing that really really sucks and of
course my boyfriend is texting me right
now so I'm sorry that the light kept
going in and out guys in this video um I
hope that you guys are interested in the
items that I got I obviously showed you
