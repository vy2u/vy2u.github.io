with another Kirby slash stick girl
triangle now in today's video guys I'll
be showing you guys some clothes from
forever 21 and Primark now Primark does
not have an online store so you guys
already know the deal I will show you
guys the items and I'm crossing my
fingers that you guys have stores and a
Primark near you that you can shop at as
far as forever21 goes I will link the
items down below now today I have a lot
of accessories I have a lot of clothing
items and most of the clothing items
that I have are kind of transitional
items so it'll kind of go from summer to
fall so you can definitely pieces office
together and kind of create a look for
yourself that's going to work for both
seasons so I'm really excited about this
video I hope you guys like all the items
do not forget to thumbs up this video
leave your comments down below subscribe
and share and if you're interested in
seeing what I have to offer in today's
video I would like you to stay tuned and
keep online okay guys so we're gonna
start with primer so the first thing I
got from Primark is this really cute bra
let now this bra that was only three
dollars on the clearance rack and I saw
it I was like oh I'm definitely gonna
get it now this is a size large and I
really like it because it doesn't have a
padding in the breast area so it's just
it's just kind of real soft and you
don't need all the extra up there it
just made my boobs look really big but
it is the lace material which is really
nice and they do have a covering on this
so therefore you won't be able to see
your nipples or any part of your boobs
now the back is cute because it has like
this little opening in the back right
here which gives like a little skin
exposure in the back I got this in a
u.s. size I believe it was a US size 12
UK size 14
yeah u.s. size 1012 in a UK size 14/16
which converts into a large I really
like this it's a definitely a good
transitional piece you can wear it just
like this in the summertime but then put
like a plaid shirt leather jacket bomber
jacket a jean jacket on to cover it and
that's in the winter or even put like a
jean shirt on and it would look really
cute with some boots so I thought this
was really cute and it was only three
dollars Oh like how you gonna like come
on now the next thing I got is a flannel
shirt I'm really crazy about flannel I
love flannel
I usually do like greens reds and blues
so I decided to opt for this yellow one
now this yellow one is yellow blue and
white which is a perfect perfect color
yellow has definitely been one of my
cause this summer I've loved yellow so
much this summer so I said hey why not
transition into the fall so I transition
into the fall by doing my checkered
style top it's really cute this one was
only nine dollars on sale so I
definitely picked this one out and I got
this one in the u.s. size 12 and it fits
perfect now the really the thing that I
really like about this one it does have
like this gold the buttons are like gold
detailed so I love gold so I thought it
was really cute and golden yellow go
well together so I just thought that
little accident kind of sold me and it
was inexpensive it's soft and it's just
a great piece for the Fall the next two
items I got were some jeans from Primark
now I'm very worried about shopping for
jeans so I took a real big chance on
this usually when I shop at Primark I
would try the clothes on at the dress
room because I'm not gonna drive all the
way to Danbury that's like a 35-minute
Drive just return something so I tried
everything on before I hit that register
now these pants are US size 12 a UK size
14 now they're both similar in style one
thing about the dark ones that these
don't have splits at the knee now the
dark blue ones that I have they do have
split at the knees which is really cute
it gives it a little bit of style and
the thing that I really was attracted to
about these pants at the bottom of the
pants leg now the bottom of the pants
legs are kind of cut frayed so therefore
it gives a little bit more of an edgy
look and these would look really good
wearing like heels or like sneakers so
you can definitely wear these pants like
all types of ways it does have like a
little bit of distress on like that on
the part right here it's very simple
super super stretchy so if you are
really really thick and you really have
a hard time finding jeans that are gonna
fit these fit really well and like I
said they're size-12
someone asks me what jean size I wear
besides fashion over jeans fashion over
jeans I can fit a size depending on the
style jeans but plus size jeans I wear
1x they do tend to be a little bit big
but they don't make extra-large talk
deal with the 1x when I'm wearing
dragula jeans I compared to Levi's jeans
jeans I wear size 12 so and leave our
jeans either shut you're not stretching
I could fit a size 12 and Levi's jeans
so if you want to know what jeans size
that where it's either between a 12 and
a 14 I would be saves 1214 so that's
what jeans size that we're so this is
jegging style so I picked it into 12
it is very stretchy you can definitely
size down to a size 10 which would be
fine too now the black ones themselves
have a little bit of a different style
the but the bottom is also frayed like
this one but it does have some distress
knits on the bottom as well too and it's
just really really nice I like how they
cut it and the ankles on these are so so
skinny these definitely will look so
good with heels I you can just do so
much with this it looks really good and
they do have a spot where you could put
a belt in so you can definitely put a
belt on to kind of pull the looking
together so this parent was actually $10
and the dark blue ones were 15 so it was
just kind of like it was a no-brainer I
was gonna buy them because like the
price was absolutely amazing so the next
few things I got from Primark are just
accessories so I'm gonna show them
closer on this on the screen for you
guys because I would lose all the light
in the world if I put this thing up wink
too close so the first thing I got are
these really cute little circle earrings
now these circle earrings are so so cute
guys they're like a gold style not
primary section usually has really
inexpensive jewelry I got these earrings
for a dollar 50 and they're just really
nice flat plain
earrings I have not opened them yet just
because I want to show you guys before I
style them but I used to wear these in a
high school like crazy so I picked these
up for a dollar 50 and they're so so
cute now the next one that I have is
also kind of one of those flat top
earrings but this one is different this
one's more soulful rose gold color and
it does have like this amazing amazing
diamond studded area it does have a
double circle so you get a mini circle
on a big circle and they look just so
cute guys these were 250 and I'm
definitely gonna rock these two I've
never worn dangly earrings like this so
it's kind of be different for me but I'm
gonna try to rock it out the best way I
can now one other thing that I got in
the clearance rack from Primark is their
necklace now this necklace was a dollar
and I know you guys look
like it's just a bandana bitch what are
you talking about so this one is a
bandana with a connected silver chain
with it now I basically goes around your
neck like a choker style look I thought
that this was so cute guys and I really
had to pick this one out like it was
only a dollar from being $7 $10 like who
why Wow like oh my gosh
I was so excited and I wanted to do this
I know this trend is probably gone now
but trends always return so this would
be so cute styling I just thought it was
cute I'm not really a silverware but I
will wear silver just for this look just
to pull this look together so I thought
this was a steal alright guys moving
along so now I'm gonna show you guys the
items I got from forever 21 now I got a
lot of stuff from forever 21 like a lot
a lot a lot so the first thing I'm gonna
show you guys is this halter top crop
top that I got now it's a really thick
sweater material to style crop top and
it is halter so you're not getting any
strapping in the back on the sides and
anything it just goes right around your
neck and on now I got this in a size
medium and this was twelve thousand
ninety cents it's really cute guys very
simple it's a sweater material that kind
of makes me feel like fall so I
definitely thought it would be great for
the summer and fall transition you can
layer it after a while and just rock it
that way
I actually think this will look nice
with a long-sleeve white t-shirt
underneath it I don't know why I just
thought that would look so cute so I
just thought this is a good deal and it
was only 1290 so why now now the next
thing I got I'm trying to be real daring
this winter or whatever so I got this
see-through red top no I'm like really
worried about stuff like this like I
randomly I really would not wear this
just because I kind of feel like it's so
trendy like when I see through but when
I saw I thought the red color was really
nice so I picked this one out I think
this one was this was 8090 cents which
is probably why I got it and it is a
size large it's really cute it would
look great with like a dark ombre red
lip I just had so many ideas leather
jacket leather boots skinny jeans I had
this whole envision idea with this one
so I picked this one out I just think
it's really cute finding good bralette
to put underneath it would just make the
outfit go to the sky so I definitely
picked this out just try to do like more
of an edgy feel this winter a real
grudge feel so I thought this will look
really
so the next topic that I'm not gonna put
it up to the light because it'll wash me
out so it's this really cute white crop
top now it's a very simple crop top and
I picked this up and it was only ten
dollars and ninety cents I got this one
in a size medium and I just thought it
was really cute white looks good all
season long every season it looks good
and I wanted something that I can just
wear with jeans or kind of really like a
little skirt or something just to kind
of play up I don't really have too many
going out outfits so this can be part of
my going-out outfit it'd just be
something to put on with jeans or a
skirt and just kind of rock it and kind
of work it through so I picked this up
for 1090 I do like the fake crisscross
strap thing it has in the front it does
not have the real pull up string so I
thought that was cute and it's kind of
ribbed so I was like why not so I picked
it out now the next thing I'm going to
show you guys it's awesome awesome
awesome crop top guys now this host
distressed sweater kind of half boob up
type of crop top thing has been really
popular and I've been looking for one of
these for so long so I found this one at
forever 21 and this was 1590 I got this
one in a size large and I absolutely
loved it it definitely looks good with
jeans you definitely go crazy with this
one and it definitely is a transitional
piece I would highly recommend that you
do wear a bralette or a sports bra or
some type of bra underneath because you
will get full exposure brass lifting
your arm up is just disastrous so I
would not recommend you doing that if
you don't have anything underneath
because your boob with Duffy fly out
it's really cute guys you can make it
sporty off you can make it into a sporty
classy dressy fasci
whatever outfit you want that's how far
you can take this to and it's just so
freakin cute I love this and it was a
little steep I feel like 1594 this
little cutout top is a little bit
expensive but it definitely is cute and
it definitely pretty trendy this winter
it's already trending now so it'll carry
off it will carry on its trend to the
end of this year honestly so the next
thing I got is this cute little bodysuit
now I know it's like a random bodysuit
to get but I love the color of the
bodysuit
now this bodysuit came with like a quad
color so came in white blue like a burnt
orange color in a yellow color and I
thought it'd look really good it kind of
gave me more so of a 70s vibe especially
when I tried it on with my suede skirt
it gave me like a 70s feel which I
really like so I picked it up I when I
saw it at the store I thought about it I
was like imma get it just for that look
I like it so much it's very simple but
the colors and stuff go well so go
together so well that it looks really
good and I thought it would look cute
cute oh god why am i messing up my words
I thought this would look cute with like
a cardigan sweater over it maybe a long
a long bomber jacket just you can work
this one out so well so I definitely
picked this out and it does have the
clasp at the bottom so if you need to
use the bathroom you just snap on well
snap off and snap on so I definitely
think these are great alright guys so I
want to show you guys another bodysuit I
got from forever 21 now this was tech
looking in the sports section but I
thought it was like a regular bodysuit
but I got it anyways because I liked it
I probably won't wear this is the gym I
probably wear this as an outfit look so
whatever so it's really cute it's black
and it says power on it now the thing I
like about this is a mesh paneling and
towards the belly part sew up mesh
panels all the way around and it's
really really cute now this was also one
of the expensive items this was 1590 and
this is a size large I just thought this
was really cute and it's so funny
because I thought I'd like I thought
about like black power like black power
I don't know if they were doing play on
words but I thought it was cute I love
the mesh design it just gives you more
of an edgy look I probably wear this
with black jeans and sneakers and call
it a day so I definitely thought this
was a deal so I had to pick that one out
I just had to pick something up on my
toe so if you watched my last lookbook
video I featured this shirt now this
shirt was on their little rack sale you
know they usually have stuff that says
like fourteen dollars sixteen dollars
ten dollars like that type of stuff so
this is this really cute silky satin top
now the thing I really like about this
one of the sleeves now the sleeves have
a nice lace pattern right at the end of
your hand or your wrist which I thought
was really cute I love this nice cherry
wine color I just thought it was so
pretty
it really looks really good on my skin
so I was like I'm gonna get this now I
got this women in size large and I
believe this was $10
I get so many compliments on this top
people love it like and this is a size
large if you want to size down you can
because it is a bit oversized but I like
the oversized look because it just makes
me feel comfortable and it just looks
more relaxed and not so tight and like
you know really restricted so I thought
this was great and for ten dollars the
color and everything is just great this
would look really good with a nice berry
lip like oh my gosh perfect perfect it's
got the last three items that I got from
forever 21 clothing wise so this is just
a plain black dress now this is a size
large and I got it for 1290 it's a very
simple black dress the only thing about
this when it does have two splits on the
side that I liked I like it just because
it's simple you can definitely style it
up with the jackets and stuff like that
you can wear heels sneakers or boots and
I just thought it was really cute it is
ribbed so if it does kind of hide a
little bit of the imperfections with the
ribbon 'us which I like but I totally
was sold on it because of the cut on the
breast area it does get a little bit
boobie so you want to be careful with
that especially if you're going to
certain places so just beware with that
if your boobie if you have bigger boobs
in mines you're definitely gonna be
spilling out all over the place so just
be careful but like I said you can wear
a jacket with this styled up so many
ways and the way that this split is the
line on both sides looks great and very
very sexy it adds like a little touch of
sex appeal which I like now the next
thing I got I got it in the plus-size
section because I'm not buying stuff
like this in a regular section because I
know it's not gonna fit and it's not
gonna look good so I got this really
cute red sweatshirt dress now I got this
in a 0x which convert into extra-large
but they call it 0x + 21 + now I thought
this was really really cute it's a red
color and it's just so nice it makes me
look like a big red like the big red or
whatever I just think it's so cute super
comfy it's like a sweatshirt sweater
material type of dress it does it's not
as short as I'm so happy it's not as
short as I thought it was gonna be it
actually goes right above the knee cap
so it's definitely appropriate and it's
something you definitely with sneakers
I've seen people wear these with heels
so you can definitely want to if you
want to jazz up and make it like a sexy
kind of sporty look you can wear heels
with this one which will look really
good like some
Brown heels or some black heels oh that
would look really nice so I thought this
was really cute and this was sixteen
dollars and like I said I played safe
this time and I shot I got this one from
plus 21 plus because I'm not taking
chances with stuff like this sometimes
when you get this in the regular size
and you have like a button curves it
cuts the wrong way this one is perfect
and I think I'm going to go back and get
the tan color in this way and this was
only 16 dollars now the last dress that
I got is my favorite favorite favorite
dress and it's a wrap dress now I got
this in a size large and I believe this
dress was fourteen ninety I wish they
had different cause in this one if they
had like a burgundy color a green color
a tan color like a black color I would
get all of them that's how much I love
this dress so it's a nice gray tone
colored dress and it is a wrap dress now
it just fits so nice you don't have to
wear shapewear with it you can just wear
it just regular it's just so nice it's
just I don't know something about it is
really nice I like the way it looks on
my skin I didn't have to wear a bra now
I would say it does have like a low-cut
boob area so if you want to wear bright
and with like a plunge bra with it or
you can just wear like a little bandeau
bra underneath because it won't give you
a little bit exposure I mean if you have
boobs or whatever you don't have to wear
a bra with it if you're fine I didn't
wear a bra with and I thought I look
fine without the bra I just thought this
was so cute guys the only thing I'm
worried about is getting sweaty pits in
this because it's a gray color but like
I said with pieces like this you
definitely could put like a jacket with
it to cover up from 20 pits I probably
wear this for my boyfriend's birthday I
just thought it was so nice and so
pretty you can wear with sneakers just
go hand with this one I just was really
really happy with this and I'm gonna go
back to see if they have different
College because I want a whole bunch of
these for the winter and the fall it
just will look so good with over the Neo
boots like just oh my god I love it so
so much guys this is one of my favorite
items like are basically accessory items
now hold it up - I'll put it on the
screen for you guys to see it up close
because you guys already know so the
first thing I got are some nice hoop
earrings guys now these are kind of like
a double-play to style earring which is
really cute not a double plate it kind
of like a double look layered look
these are really cute guys I'm gonna put
one on so I could show you guys what it
looks like they are really really cute
earrings if I could even get this off
there are really really cute hoops one
thing I would say about these hoops guys
they're super heavy so I would be very
careful you don't want to split your
earlobes but they are kind of heavy and
I don't know if heavy earrings aren't in
style now but they had a private tool
and oh my god oh my god
yeah it's with some long black hair
mm-hmm yes yes our oh my god I love
these guys they're really cute they are
definitely a bit thicker and they're
heavier than usual so if you have ears
that are already splitting do not put
these on because your ears would drop I
don't know if they're in season right
now these thick earrings so I think
they're because they had a whole bunch
of these like heavy thick earrings in
stock so definitely check them out for
these they're really pretty look at that
oh my god I love these so they look
really good I'm ready just gonna end the
show with this and the show in the video
with this earring home now the next
thing I got was some MIDI rings like I
got just basically mini rings I usually
get these all the time
they came in a pack two of them three of
them fell off and they're just really
simple mini rings that I usually wear
and they're gold
I love these they're very nice to
accessorize I am getting henna done
tomorrow so I think it's gonna look so
cute so yeah I got the mini rings and
these were six thousand ninety cents now
the next thing I got is that kind of I'm
not sure if this is a choker but it
almost looks like a choker and when I
put it on it's probably going to end up
being a choker so I'm really excited
about this one now it is a really cute
triple plated triple knot triple it in
it's like a triple necklace it has three
no light it has four necklace chains
connected to one and it's basically kind
of like a layered necklace slip which I
love I'm definitely gonna rock this when
I'm gonna try to get it to be as close
to my neck as possible so I can have
like that choker look cuz I really
really like that nice over layer choker
look now so I picked this one up for a
five thousand ninety cents now the next
one I got is really a choker now this is
one of those really thick gold-plated
chokers now this one definitely comes
like right above my neck my fat neck
fold so I really think that this is cute
this is like one of those necklaces that
you really have to have
now if I can even find a long ones one
that kind of ends up right here and put
this on together I would be bitching so
I'm really happy about this one this one
ran me about 590 as well their jewelry
is pretty expensive at this place like
they really know how to rack up the
prices on a forever 21 with the jewelry
but it's well worth it it doesn't last
as long but adjusting gets the outfit
looking alright guys so that basically
