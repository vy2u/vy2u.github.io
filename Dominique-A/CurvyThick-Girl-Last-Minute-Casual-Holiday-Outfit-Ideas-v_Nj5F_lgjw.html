today with another fashion Friday video
so today's video guys is gonna be a
little bit different obviously as you
guys saw in the title so this video
today is gonna be like a last minute
holiday outfit like pics or whatever so
basically what I'm trying to do is show
you guys some kind of last-minute outfit
ideas now I was kind of like frantic
this whole entire week trying to find
outfit ideas like for up-and-coming
parties and stuff like that and I kinda
just like took like a minute to think to
myself like honestly why am i
overthinking outfits when I'm just like
real simple and straight to the point
so I'm the type of person that's really
casual when it comes to outfits I like
to kind of amplify my office with my
makeup my hair and kind of like my
accessories and stuff like that when it
comes to clothes your clothes doesn't
have to your clothes don't always have
to emphasize your entire look adding
accessories and stuff definitely kind of
like take you further as well too so
what I want to do is show you guys a
couple outfits ideas that I had in mind
for the holiday season even if I'm just
going out with some friends and going on
my boyfriend I'm going to a holiday
party or whatever I do have a couple
outfits that would be great for those
occasions and something that you guys
might be interested in so in this video
I kind of showed you guys head to toe
shots so you guys can see my hat if I
wear a hat my hairstyle my shoes
everything so this video I hope is very
helpful for you guys and I hope you guys
enjoyed this one today's video guys is
sponsored by 50 so 50 reached out to me
and they wanted me to show you guys a
new product that they have in stock so
if you're familiar with 5050 basically
has like the teabag packets and they
have the 14 day and 28 day detox so
about three years ago when I was on
Weight Watchers and I lost like 35
pounds I used to take the actual fit T
itself and I used to do it
mix with like a new diet plan and kind
of like exercise and I was really
successful with my diet plan and my
weight loss around that time so once I
kind of dumped that plan along I kind of
gained on my way back so 2018 is
definitely my resolution to get back in
like a nice lifestyle kind of like
maintain my weight or kind of tone my
body up and kind of get myself a boost
of energy so they do have these new fat
burning tablets that they have now these
type of new tablets are supposed to give
you a boost of energy and are supposed
to help you kind of increase some weight
loss so I'm gonna try really hard this
year to use this product and
try to kind of find a way to live a
better lifestyle
try to lose some weight I don't
necessarily want to look like 20 pounds
35 pounds is definitely not but listen
like 1015 pounds will put me where I
need to be at I just want to be a little
bit healthier I definitely catch myself
breathing extra hard walking up the
stairs sometimes so I'm like yo I gotta
get back so basically those give you a
60 days 60 tablets as a 30 day supply
you take two tablets a day and you drink
a lot of water with an extra Swift
exercise and a nice diet plan you should
be able to lose this weight now the
pills kind of remind me of kind of like
a Hydroxycut but I'm hoping that these
all like stroke me out or anything like
that so they're made with all-natural
products so I'm crossing my fingers that
it's nothing that's gonna be like a
cardiac issue or whatever but we'll see
I have that seen anyone else review it
yet maybe I should actually look it up
on YouTube but I will come back and
update you guys with this product just
to give you guys a full hundred-percent
review on it so that you guys aren't
kind of lost about the product so I will
leave everything down below in regards
to this product if you guys are
interested and if you're interested in
seeing what I have to offer in the rest
of this video I would like you to stay
tuned and keep alright guys so the first
time that I'm gonna show you is probably
my favorite outfit out of the whole
bunch so this one is really casual very
simple and it's very cute and I kind of
pieced up items that I really like so
the first thing I want to show you guys
are these nice shoes and I showed you
guys this before one of our other trying
haul videos and these over the knee Hill
boots are from public desire and then
it's nice burgundy color and they have
like this block Hill SuperDuper
comfortable guys they do have an amazing
stretch on the ankle part on the calf
part and all the way up to the thigh so
if you have like really big calves and
really large size they definitely fit
really nice because it stretches so this
one definitely fits well and it went
well with my outfit so basically I wore
this kind of sweater dress and the
sweater dress is like a Manilla color or
like an off-white color dress sweater
dress now I like this a lot I was
referred 21 and it's a size large and I
believe this was the one of the ones I
was on sell for like $14 or $12
now I wish that I bought this maybe like
last year and it's like I feel like I
wish shows like a little bit bigger
because the devil is rising up on me
because of my blood but when I put the
jacket on top of it and defecated pieces
I the Alpha end together properly so I
wasn't exposing
too much but I do like the kind of
off-white kind of like Manila color
makes it the kind of burgundy boots I
thought it looked cute and then I also
added my fashion over long distressed
jacket on top of it
now this one I realized after I recorded
that I didn't take the tags off so this
one is from fashion of a curve it is
they're hyper crushed jacket and 1x and
it's a really cute kind of like a
longline jean jacket very nice it's a
nice kind of light blue color distressed
jacket and I thought together with the
outfit and look really really cute
together so I was definitely feeling
myself in this one I definitely think
that putting a long jacket like this
with kind of like a short dress because
the jacket is long it kind of has
illusion in a way that it's not too
short and with the over they need help
boots only had like a little gap of skin
showing so it kind of like made the
outfit look appropriate in a way so this
is an outfit I definitely wear if I was
going on like a little date night with
my boyfriend to go see the tree in the
city the tree in New York City if he
doesn't I mean or try to just go with a
little casual date like I am going to a
Lakers game tomorrow Saturday not a
Lakers game whoa I'm going to see a
Knicks game on Saturday so it'd be
something cute to wear like two Knicks
game or sports man whatever you want to
do so I thought it was a nice
last-minute outfit idea
it's that be comfortable it is chilly a
F on the East Coast like when I mean
cold 23 degrees cold at night so I
definitely thought it was cute I would
definitely put a scarf on it like and
then if I even had like a different
jacket like a heavier jacket I'll put
the heavier jacket on top of it as well
too so I definitely like layered up
times three but in reference thinking
like I'll be like casually cute and
casually popping so I definitely like
this outfit a lot guys and I definitely
think that you have these types of
pieces and definitely over the knee heel
boots definitely just make everything so
much better and the heel is not a really
skinny heel it's a nice chunky heel so
therefore you're not struggling
throughout the evening or whatever
you're doing or wherever you're going
alright guys so the next up and I'm
gonna show you guys I really really like
this outfit a lot
it definitely has like a taste of class
to it that is just so cute now I
definitely added Dom style to it by
adding my fedora hat and some nice cute
boots to go with it so the fedora hat
that I'm showing you guys I believe this
one is from romwe
I'm not sure but I did get one dose from
forever21 so I'll try to link one
similar to this down below now I love
hats like this for the wintertime it
just gives you like this extra glam this
extra chic look so I definitely wear
these a lot with my short hairstyles my
bob styles are my long styles so I
definitely thought that this was cute to
piece with this outfit I did also go on
with some shoes I got from romwe these
kind of like ankle booties and they're
like really pointy at the front and it
has like a black heel as well too now I
have wear black heels guys because heels
that are really really skinny just like
my big body cannot support that little
heel and I'm not even being funny I'm
like wobbly in those types of heels but
you'll catch me wearing a sporadically
like once in a while I'll kind of slap
one of those on but I do like to keep it
safe and comfortable with block heel so
you always see me with a nice block heel
and I definitely like these because they
definitely give you more of like a sleek
chic look because it's so pointy at the
front and definite has like a stretchy
ankle part so if you have wide ankles
big calves this stuff is gonna fit good
and it hugged my ankle up really nice
and it look really chic and really slim
on my leg so I thought that this was
really cute now the dress that I got is
a crushed velvet dress and this dress is
from simply B so I was looking for an
outfit that was kind of like an Alfa
Decker works like a Christmas party some
type of formal party and add my own
style and spice to by adding the fedora
hat in the boots so usually I feel like
with dresses like this you were like
like a baby heel or something
and put like a little like picot on top
of it but that's just not what I'm gonna
do so I thought this dress was really
cute it's like a crushed velvet dress
it's a berry color and it's kind of
pleated has like a three layered pleat
on the bottom I did feature this dress
before guys on my lookbook I did a few
months ago for simply B so I'll link
that down below for you guys I just like
the crushed velvet color just looks
really really nice on me and because
it's kind of like one of those pleated
dresses on the bottom it's definitely
the type of dress you could do like a
little shimmy shimmy in it and it just
looks really cute and glamorous so I
thought this dress was really cute and I
honestly would wear something like this
too like a fun little gathering or like
to a nice like formal Christmas party
for my job or something like that I just
think that it looks really nice and it's
really one of those dresses that will
really like you walk us through my runs
up oh my god
like that is amazing so I thought it was
really cute dress and I definitely
wanted to show you guys this because the
whole outfit together when I piece it
together I just was feeling and I was
like this is really like classically
chic AF so I really was feeling it like
a lot so this happen I'm gonna show you
guys it's definitely something that you
guys have seen me wear but I feel like
with it comes to distressed jeans people
feel like it's not something you should
wear like in the wintertime just because
it's really holy but I'm obsessed with
books distressed jeans now I definitely
love turtlenecks shirts as well during
the wintertime so you'll see me with a
lot of turtlenecks just because it gives
you like this really cute look when it's
kind of like choked up on your neck and
stuff like that so the first thing I
want to show you guys is a simple black
turtleneck now I always wear turtlenecks
I like to do white grey black or white
for the wintertime it's just those steam
colors that I like to wear with
turtlenecks or in the winter you won't
never catch me like a mustard color like
a green color I keep it real simple
white gray burgundy and black so those
are my color eternal next I like I
definitely like the ribbed one as well
too but I definitely just got this plain
one right here now I got those from one
from forever 21 about two years ago it's
a size large and it's really really nice
it's just a plain black turtleneck and
it does have like a nice thick
turtleneck too so you don't necessarily
have to wear it kind of a scarf or
anything a def that covers your neck up
if it's really really blisteringly cold
outside so I thought this was really
nice it's very soft it kind of has like
that ashy black look but whatever will
disregard that
now I paired this one off with some
jeans I got from forever 29 I'm told I'm
from fashion OVA and basically I got
these jeans guys and a size 15 which is
a wet a waist 31 or is that waist 31 and
I think that these are so cute now these
are the ones that are really distressed
guys and these aren't distressed all the
way to the ankle part right here now
usually I would wear these without like
a bootleg or something that covered the
ankle part but because it's a little bit
colder outside and like I said I do not
like wearing like open-toed shoes and
stuff like that too much in the
wintertime unless it's kind of like New
Year's or you know what I mean so with
this one I paid it off with the black
boots from the last app that I showed
you guys I thought that the black boots
look really cute with it it was also
like a very chic look and I did go in
and change my hair up a little bit for
you guys and I did kind of like that
Auburn hairstyle so I really
fill my outfit all totally like that's
definitely I got a nice going out outfit
to meet with your girl's just chill
something real cute
I thought the outfit was really nice and
even though it's a distressed Jean type
of outfit and I know people are just
don't like that in the wintertime and
think that distressed jeans are like a
winter look I personally just like that
outfit so much I thought that it was so
so cute and just the structure of
tucking the shirt in if I had a black
belt it would have set the outfit off
guys so I'm definitely give me myself a
black belt just to kind of add with it
it just would have set the outfit
entirely off and it kind of cinched me
in a little bit in the waist area a
little bit more and I would have just
been like girl but I definitely thought
the outfit was cute the way the jeans
are really skinny at the ankles and it
goes into the boot just gave it just
gave my look a little bit more of an
edge to it so I really liked it a lot
and even the hairstyle just kind of set
the look off so that definitely is one
of my favorite outfits as well too guys
and the first one I think everything
that I chose was really nice I kinda
have like a hard time trying to pick out
what I like but I try to stay true to
myself in this trend in this video just
because I wanted to show you guys my
sense of some things that I like to wear
I don't necessarily wear the same style
all the time sometimes I'll wake up and
say I'm just gonna wear this bunny off
and do like a beet face so it's kind of
like it's like one of those things I
just have like I just I style whatever I
want I don't like having like a
definitive look or style I wear what I
like to wear how I feel so I'm not
feeling shitty one day like I'll wear
like a shitty outfit you know I'm saying
but I'll just do my makeup and then have
that kind of like a bunny outfit but it
would be kind of an outfit with
structure so I dumped it that does this
outfit was excellent guys I just liked
it a lot and it just had like an extra
bit of sex appeal that I was just like
yes so another fun outfit choice that I
had guys that I thought was really cute
now this is super duper casual like I
said this is a casual look book or look
ideas so this dress was one that I got
from Zach fool.com
now this was really cute like this crash
crushed velvet green dress now I like I
said I'm like obsessed with this green
velvet crushed velvet kind of style like
kind of trend now it's really trendy
right now guys and I'm probably gonna
kind of like go into the - 2018 as well
- so I'm not gonna get all caught up
into it now because it's gonna linger
linger linger linger
so this was kind of like that t-shirt
dress style and definitely has this cute
little collar on it this is a size large
and I wanted it in a size extra large
but it didn't have an extra large so I
got this one just kind of playing it
kind of like safe but cautious at the
same time now this one is really cute
guys it definitely has a little bit of a
rise to it so if you're curvier which is
mostly any of you writing wipes my
channel is pretty curvy like me so if
you're curvy like me or curvier this
dress will kind of rise up a lot so with
the walk that you do I don't know like
my butt just listed up a lot and this
has two slits on the side which is kind
of annoying at the same time but it
definitely gives you like a little bit
of sex appeal
so with this dress I definitely wear a
jacket over just to kind of conceal some
of that extra additive areas are out but
I think that the green color really
complements my skin tone it just looks
really good the dress has a great shape
to it as well too
it does have like a collar on it so
therefore you do kind of have like a
little bit of a style a little bit of
swag with it but the thing I like is the
front pockets in the front and just how
it's like a nice length it's not too
short in the back it does have the
little slits on the side which kind of
gives you an illusion that it's kind of
short but not really short so it's kind
of like one of those iffy things but it
definitely looks really good guys and I
definitely really like this a lot it is
a really nice soft material and it's
something that I would recommend wearing
just at any age any type of social event
you can definitely wear this with boots
too but I decided to pair your mind off
with my vans my high-top vans I thought
it was really cute it gave the outfit
more of a casual look to it it wasn't so
dressed up and so kind of like confined
and conformed and I just thought that
together like the kind of like a sporty
edgy kind of vibe to it was really cute
in here and everything obviously goes
together as well too so it's not be
acute outfit if you're going out with
your friends just a quick little date
night bowling whatever but it's
definitely one of those great
last-minute outfit ideas that you can
bring together and just make it look
fabulous and vans are trending right now
and the dress crushed-velvet is trending
so it's kind of like two trends on top
of each other just absolutely gorgeous
like I just thought this outfit was so
fun and it's not something that's too
tight where you're gonna feel like
really stuff like a sausage or you're
not gonna feel like oh my god my rolls
are hanging out everybody's looking at
my fatness
it's not that type of dress you
definitely be super comfortable in this
and I definitely think that this is
definitely one of those really relaxed
cute sexy casual outfits like I love
this so much so that basically wraps up
the video guys I hope you guys enjoyed
