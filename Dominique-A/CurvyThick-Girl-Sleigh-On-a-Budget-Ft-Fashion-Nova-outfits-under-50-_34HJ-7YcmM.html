with another Kirby slash stick girl
trying halt so this video today is
sponsored by fashion over comm so I will
link all the items down below for you
guys if you guys are interested in any
of these items so I'm gonna show you
guys today six outfits under $50 so it's
kind of going for like the holiday theme
New Year's Christmas Christmas parties
Kwanzaa Hanukkah whatever you celebrate
I got an outfit for you so fashion OVA
is a bit on the sexy side so what I've
done for some of these pieces are kind
of plung'd I did have to go in and sew
them close them up a little bit by
selling it together so if you're someone
that's really conservative then you
might kind of want to reconsider buying
some of these pieces but you can always
wear like a bralette underneath it just
to kind of protect your womanhood so I
just want to see here in the beginning
before people are like oh my god she
expose so much this is not the type of
holiday look I would go for but this is
the holiday look Tom's gonna go for so
as far as all the items that I selected
guys I did try to keep in mind the
quality of the items so this time around
guys I'm very very pleased with the
items that I chose a lot of this stuff
is definitely slaying so you definitely
will be slaying your faction over
clothes this frickin holiday season so I
hope you guys like this video I really
like the items that I got and I'm really
excited about this one so if you're
interested in seeing what I have to
offer for today's John haul guys I would
like you to stay tuned and keep home
alright guys so I'm not gonna go on like
any special order when it comes to this
I'm just gonna go through them and talk
about and show you guys what they are so
I did kind of do a lot to pieces are
kind of the velvet pieces and it's funny
cuz you're like the Christmas colour I
got one that's kind of like a burgundy
red and then one that screen the velvet
for me I don't know something about it
the crushed velvet colors for the winter
and the holidays just really stole my
heart this time so when I saw them on
the website I was like oh my god I
really have to have that now I've had
experiences with fashion over in the
past where some of the items that I
would receive just didn't fit or the
material wasn't what I expected so what
I'm gonna say to you guys is when you're
shopping make sure you read the reviews
down below and they're um under the
clothes wear the clothes listed at when
I was selecting the items this time I
definitely read the reviews from other
people who purchased from them and then
kind of looked at the materials and
stuff like that to make my ultimate
decision on whether I wanted to choose
this item or not regardless if I paid
for it or not you still I still want to
come in
you guys quality instead of things that
are not going to be good
so I'm going to say all the items that
have gotten everything is quality so
this is going to be this is I'm really
excited about this one so the first off
I'm going to show you guys it's kind of
like this berry crushed-velvet
is do you even call it cross velvet like
it's crushed velvet the name of it or I
don't know so it's kind of like this
jumpsuit and it's like a berry color
guys I how my god like I'm like really
like weird when it comes to jumpsuits so
this one for me was a one this was a one
so I got this one in the size I believe
extra-large and with me I get kind of
nervous with stuff like this because I
have big thighs like I know sometimes
when you guys watch my chart haul
doesn't look like I'm really like my
thighs are humongous so when I'm buying
clothes out from fashion over like
specially jumpsuits and stuff I really
have to be kind of careful with the
jumpsuits because sometimes if it
doesn't have them on a stretch I need my
thighs will swallow and eat the pants up
so it would be kind of like pointless
I'll just look like a stuffed sausage so
this time around with this one I was
kind of nervous but I selected the
extra-large because I read the reviews
and other people said that you can
either size up or size down with this
one because it was it was real roomy and
stretchy so I was like yes
so definitely like I said to you guys
when you're purchasing on this website
if you're not sure read the comments in
the in the video read the comments
underneath the clothes Joey so this is
what this one looks like it's basically
it has like a little bit of a plunge in
the front guys it's not to like it's not
to expose it's definitely not as exposed
as a lot of the other pieces are but
this one does have like a little bit of
a boob areas showing it is really nice
it's a stretchy kind of velvet material
guys the best part to this one I'm
usually not a belt person but this one
came like this nice gold-plated belt
that kind of matches what doesn't kind
of match it matches and together in
combination when you put the jumpsuit on
with a belt
okay I just I'm getting bad height
because I know like I like oh my gosh
guys this outfit right here altogether
and it's one outfit and the outfit
wasn't even expensive to begin with so
that's outfit number one guys and it
came with the Belen
like my expectation level rose highly
once I started trying these clothes I'm
like yo this is where they step their
game up at fashion oh because this is
just everything to me
guys this one the bottom of the pants
like it's kind of like a wide leg too so
therefore it's really long so you
definitely wear this with heels and just
be oh oh my god not even for New Year's
I wear something like this with like
really like a nice bedazzle choker would
be cute and even my hairstyle with this
one was poppin you couldn't tell me
nothing like I just you know what I'll
do is what kind of like switched my lip
into kind of like almost like a berry
lip you guys know I love my ma flip but
a berry lip what even went oh and like a
nice
Creasy black brown and like kind of like
a berry crease guys this this alpha hat
woke me up like and I'm I know you guys
are watching you guys probably yo this
is that's it she did that like like that
outfit what this alpha right here is
everything so and then this office not
even expensive to begin with it's kind
of like all you need to do is slap some
shoes on a car today you don't really
have to do anything like this is the
outfit hair makeup outfit done so I'm if
you if you were looking for this and I
know once you guys watch it on a blank I
need to get this you guys definite to
get this I'm not sure if they sell this
in other colors but as far as being
other colors I don't even care this one
was perfect guys and do they have other
clothes I don't know but I'm starting to
think that they probably have this in
like a blue I'm not sure if they do have
it in the pool I think the blue is sold
out exactly why I didn't get the blood I
got the berry but I'm very happy with
the berry the berry looks really good on
my skin so this was a win-win now the
next outfit I'm gonna show you guys it's
actually a combination off it with pants
in the top so I usually don't buy the
pants like the stretch pants from them
because I'm nervous that they not gonna
fit so this one I got in a size extra
large I believe and these are kind of
like high-waisted kind of like palazzo
pants or dress pants now the material is
definitely different from what I thought
it was gonna be when I looked on the
website the website kind of showed it
different so when I first got I was like
this little bitty bitty waist is not
gonna fit me but the pants are super
stretchy guys so you don't have to worry
about that that like they're extremely
stretchy one thing I don't
like about these in a ways that little
little zipper it has so if you're
somebody that has a big butt or if
someone who's really rough with their
stuff you definitely will break this
little zipper in two pieces two seconds
done so I wish they made like a kind of
like a sturdier zipper because this is
the type of zipper guys if you know what
I mean this is tab as if but that's
gonna break so I'm gonna say be
light-handed not heavy-handed with it
because you will break that baby in a
second so the basically the pants are
really cute they're wide leg pants they
are extremely long I'm not gonna lie I'm
5'4 and a half and these are really
really long on me so I'll be like five
seven five eight five nine you're gonna
get away with this one with no issue I'm
kind of like on the shorter end of thing
so this for me was really long but this
being long is perfect because I can wear
my nice platform heels with it and work
something out so I'm not even worried
about it I'm still happy still pleased
with it the entire look that I went for
with this outfit was just everything
very simple guys very cute
now the pants does have like this little
pleated look in the front way of this
little this is pleated I think it's
pleated and the front goes all the way
down very nice it just gives the pants a
different structure a different look I
also paired this one with this cute body
bodysuit now this body suit and these
pants was a little over the budget by
three dollars so I still stayed with
them budget well kind of three dollars
over but it was like fifty three dollars
for this entire outfit right here which
is not bad at all guys like I said this
is a two-piece office so it's kind of
like a bodysuit and pants and these two
pieces you can actually wear with other
stuff so it kinda is worth the money
like really worth the money so this one
is a body suit guys it's kind of like
this cranberry color I like this a lot
and going for the theme of the holiday
the colors and stuff like that I didn't
purposely do that I just saw it on the
website and I liked and I was like oh
I'm gonna get that so it's kind of like
it's kind of weird cuz then after I
looked at my car I was like yo
everything is kind of like Christmasy
but it doesn't matter everything's gonna
work out I'm sure of it
so this is really cute guys I actually
had to go in and sew this together so
this is one of the pieces that was the
plunge was way too sexy way way way too
low and is this kind of like I can't I
honestly can't where am I gonna go with
this I don't even go clubbing so I
closed it up a little bit just to kind
of bring it
a little bit so it's not to expose the
expose II so I think it looks better and
it's a body sue and I just snap open to
snap clothes on the bottom it does have
like a wide sleeve and this is a size
extra-large as well too and this one is
actually more expensive than the pants
the pants were 20 bucks and this was
this says it was 30 2.99 but I feel like
this wasn't there I thought this was 20
to 99 I don't even know but all I know
it's like three dollars over budget so
therefore owes one of the this has had
to be the 33 and the pants had to be
$19.99 but I do like this often in
combination guys I thought it was really
really cute and it just really liked the
whole the hair no no some but it was
just really I just I was feeling myself
I was really really feeling my so the
next dress I got is a little bit sexy
guys so I was a little bit wary when I
first got it cuz I was like wow that
cuts a very high so this is just a basic
sweater dress not really basic it's a
sweater dress concept but they kind of
did a lot of sexy additives to it to
kind of give you a little bit more of a
lift now I would wear this to maybe like
a New Year's thing or like something
where it's kind of like socially out
like party style I wonder where this
occurs this party or anything like that
I would keep this more on the New Year's
bound even though it's kind of like
basic they did add sexy pieces to it to
kind of amplify the look so this is
basically like a cutout sweater dress it
has the cold shoulder sleeves it's just
this one is a size large and it fits
very well guys this one is super
SuperDuper stretchy so you can if you
are 1x 2x 3x you can definitely size
down I thought that this was cute now
this is where it gets really really
tricky so on this side right here all
the way up to at least the upper crotch
area like right where the pelvis or the
groin area starts at that's where the
dress starts so it is um it's a pretty
sexy dress might I say but I think like
it looks really really good now like I
said I wouldn't wear this to nobody's
house for Christmas or I wouldn't try it
you know just think about the areas and
the places you're at think about your
surroundings before you try to walk out
with stuff like that so that's number
one just put it out there before
somebody tries to tell me about myself
but I thought it was really cute though
it does strap up all the way it just has
this really cute sex appeal to it that I
was really vibe
and even with heels or whatever whatever
you want to put on your feet I just
thought it was simple and the thing I
liked most about it was an actual
turtleneck that turtleneck kind of gifts
this dress a little bit of a different
vibe your hair definitely has to be
different for a dress like this because
then your neck is covered so you're not
having jewelry show it on your neck so
you kind of got you're gonna have to
kind of keep those in mind when trying
this type of dress on but all in all I
thought that this was a great price
it has great details on it and it
definitely has a sex appeal and it's
definitely cozy because it is a sweater
material so I would say if you're going
to like a yacht party or something like
really cool fun low-key chill type of
situation this would be very nice and
you definitely will turn your you a lot
of heads will turn when you walk into
the room because this is definitely a
bad one a bad guys moving along so the
next item I'm gonna show you guys is
this two-piece set now when I initially
got this one when I saw it on the
website I was like okay I'm like really
like thigh heavy so when I pick up
pieces like satin pieces I definitely
need to size up but for some reason they
sent me this in a size extra large so
it's kind of like a if you thing now it
fits me in the bottom part like on the
waistband part but when it comes to like
the Crescent thigh part like the middle
thigh gap area I get really it gets
really tight in that area just because
my thighs are really big in that area so
I wish that they would have sent it to
me in a size 1x instead of an extra
largest because the bottom should have
been a little bit wider a little bit
bigger for me just to be more
comfortable the size extra large top
fits good but if you have large large
breasts I highly recommend you size up
because this one almost I almost caught
in nip slip in this one so it's kind of
like something I wouldn't recommend
wearing if you have extremely large
boobs but this is really cute it's like
a burgundy color so I'm kind of sticking
with the fall holiday theme or whatever
so it does have like an open shoulder
area right here and it does have a tie
in the front it's really cute it's a
sexy piece and it's upsetting obviously
so definitely gives you kind of like a
romantic sexy holiday vibe there are no
pockets in the pants but whatever what
you're going to do is wear like a bring
like a little side bag or something it
is wide leg at the bottom but like I
said because this type of material kind
of my thighs swallow this type of
material it kind of shrunk a little bit
so I'm not getting like
the the pants are kind of hitting the
floor like I usually like them to so you
can definitely heels on it to kind of
counteract that that factor but other
than that I think it's cute I just wish
I could have mixed match the bottom and
the top and got the bottom in the 1x and
then kept the top and extra-large but
other than that I think it's really cute
it's a nice color it's definitely sexy
AF so it's something to consider if
you're interested in like a piece like
this I definitely think that it's really
cute so the next piece that I got which
is probably one of my favorite pieces
well not really the Burgundy's jumpsuit
is my favorite and I have another one
I'm gonna show you my favorite buy it's
one of the ones that I really like as
well so this is an all black jumpsuit
guys and it's really cute it's more of
like a relaxed kind of look so when I
kind of styled in the video I kind of
were kind of in a more relaxed way and I
think it's something you could wear if
you're going just to like a holiday
party that your friends throwing or
something like that or even just to like
a social hangout at a lounge or whatever
I really really like this and I know you
guys are gonna like it too they had this
one in black and they also had it in tan
but I went for the black just because I
like that whole edgy vibe that whole
vampy vibe for the fall in the winter so
that's why I opted for the black one it
definitely has a lot of sex appeal so
this one did have a little bit of a
deeper cut in the breast area and like I
said for people who are more
conservatives I don't want to be too out
there and one expose their entire
motherhood I mean motherhood their
womanly hood I would say go in and sew
it together so I did go in and sew this
together just a little bit with my
needle thread just to cover it up a
little bit cuz I don't want all that
exposure sometimes it's good for one one
type of thing and not good for
everything else so I try to keep it a
little bit clean with this one so
basically it's a full jump in jump suit
and it's kind of like a it's kind of
like a ribbed material it does have a
waist belt that you can tie around you
give it a tie to the back or tie to the
side I tied my to the side just because
I thought look cute now this is really
cute too soft material guys super super
soft it's not one of those like thin
kind of rib types suits or whatever it's
very thick and looks so cute and I can
imagine all the pieces I'm gonna wear
with it I actually styled it with like
my middle part Bob in the head I just
gave me kind of like a cooler vibe so I
thought that was a cute outfit so I was
really proud of myself but I think it's
really cute it is kind of ankle staad so
you're not gonna have any
flair with this one it just stops at
your ankles it does kind of like this
word thing it'll stop at your ankles but
it'll still be like a little flare so
sometimes what I'll do is go in and sew
it to shut it up a little bit so that it
does really suck my ankles but other
than that I think it's a fabulous piece
you can style it up and sell it down is
definitely going to be a party pop and
outfit and the fact that it's a jumpsuit
you don't really have to utilize too
many pieces you just jump in it and go
so I highly highly recommend you ladies
pick this one out is definitely one that
you need for the season guys the last
item I'm going to show you guys is one
of my favorite as well and I did tell
you guys before I was kind of going for
a lot of that kind of crushed velvet
theme so this one is kind of Christmasy
you guys it's definitely green this is
the first time I'm ever doing like a
velvet green color but I really really
liked it on the website I believe they
had this one different colors but this
one was the one that was available and I
never had a green velvet so I was like
let me just get this one so this one is
kind of like one of those cowl-neck
dresses so a definate has a lot of
gaping in the front of it and it it's
like a body con dress
now this one is really really cute guys
I like it a lot this one is a size I
believe extra-large and this one was
priced at $29.90 it's a body con dress
it has that nice large cow neck whatever
it is I think that's what you call it so
basically with this one and what I would
do is kind of do a lot of layer
necklaces with it or like a statement
piece earring which I did feature in
this video and I will show you guys in a
few minutes so adding like little pieces
like that too would be really nice so I
would consider doing that it is a midi
dress so goes but it goes on past your
knees which is really nice and
conservative as well so if you're not
someone that likes to kind of expose
yourself out there too much or going to
an event that you need to keep it nice
and tight I would recommend this dress
just because it's not too sexy it does
have an opening but you can kindly close
that opening up or wear something
underneath to cover it but it definitely
looks really good guys and I think that
this is gonna be my Christmas dress so
I'm probably gonna wear it on Christmas
or during the holidays this whole month
it's kind of like a festival or a
festive kind of mob so I'll find
somewhere to wear
I got some places to go so you know what
the last thing I'm gonna show you guys
are some accessories that I picked up as
well and I did feature them with a few
of my outfits on here so the first thing
I want to show you guys are these really
cute earrings now I'm not really someone
that's really statement piece
earring type I like kind of like studs
or like hoops just regular hoops but I
saw this it was kind of like the double
layered and earring set and I was like
you know what I'm gonna try this out so
you might have seen me feature this with
the green dress it's just kind of like a
drama it adds a little bit of a drama to
like a plain dress I thought it was
really cute my hair tucked back and I
don't know I felt this vibe so much so I
thought it was cute on the website so I
picked it out and it's the first time
I've ever tried an earring like this and
I thought that it worked perfect with
that outfit I think this was marked at
ten dollars it's really cute and adding
a piece like this just in general like
with your holiday dresses is definitely
to care you look farther so I definitely
recommend checking these out on the
website now the other thing I got is
this kind of cute necklace now I usually
do these necklace often so I featured
one of these in one of my hair videos
and you guys kept asking me where I got
it from that was from H&amp;amp;M that hmm
Charlotte Russe like months like not
even months ago like two or three years
ago so I saw this on the website and
this is more so of a choker style and so
it's really up on your neck so I did
show you guys what this one looked like
with the outfit with the pants and the
shirt and I thought it was really cute
it has like this nice kind of glare on
it it's a gold I love gold accents stuff
like that just really brings me to life
so when I saw it on the website I was
like I gotta get this I have to have
this these types of necklaces definitely
work for the holidays if you're trying
to have that extra glam that extra glitz
it just works a lot so I definitely like
this when I wear any wigs to because I
definitely match my wigs with my jewelry
which is kind of weird if you know what
I mean leave your comment down below so
this one definitely can go with the
light of my units too so I just saw a
lot of potential with this one so I
picked this one out alright guys so that
basically wraps up this video I hope you

actually had a lot of fun with this
video because I liked all the items that
I got
