Kirby slash big girl China now in
today's video I'll be showing you guys
jeans only this time so if you are a
sick slash curvy girl who cannot find
jeans in your size then this video is
the video for you
now these jeans are provided from a
company called mono teks comm and
they're an la-based website now they
have jeans from size zero to size 3x so
the jeans that I'll be showing you guys
today are emphasized extra large two
sides 1x but for you thicker thicker
thicker one they also carry 3x so I will
leave all the links down below for all
the jeans if you guys are interested I
am going to show like distress jean
shorts and like all that kind of stuff I
did kind of base this one off a lot of
distress style jeans just because
distressed style jeans are really hard
to wear when you're little bit thicker
in the thighs so I'm to show you guys
some types of jeans that I thought look
really good with thicker thighs and kind
of meteor thighs so yeah so make sure
you guys leave all your comments down
below don't forget to thumbs up this
video and hit that subscribe button if
you have it and if you're interested in
seeing what I have today in this video I
would like you to stay tuned and keep
online so I'm going to jump right into
this video and show you guys these jeans
these shorts so I'm going to start with
shorts person I got 2 pairs of shorts
and these shorts are similar in style
but they're different color so I got a
black parent and like this army green
pair of shorts now the thing about these
shorts are they're kind of like those
kind of like high cut-up shorts in the
butt area where it's like really
high-waisted now this I would have
honestly been afraid to wear before but
I'm like I just have that now I'm just
you know I'm I'm happy where I'm at
right now
with the weight and stuff like that like
impact with my body that I don't care
anymore like these I'm going to wear
these this summer I'm probably going to
wear these to Jamaica when I go to
Jamaica just because it's going to be
blazing hot 97 out that bitch so these
are the brim for these shorts are the
Aphrodite pants now I got these in a
size extra large now there are really
cute and they're kinda like the frayed
shorts at the bottom so you get like a
lot of bit of that a lot of it you get a
lot of fray at the bottom and they're
high-waisted and there are also a high
cut
so you do get some cheek action on the
bottom so I will put in parental
advisory here so you guys don't get
offended but they are rather cheeky but
they're really cute guys and they do
have a perfect stretch to them so
wearing these you definitely will be
slaying the game so I did get two pairs
I got a green one in the same size and I
also got a black one so I'm definitely
excited about these like I said they're
super stretchy so um if you're like
don't know I feel like if I would've got
at 1x had been too big so the extra legs
work perfectly fine for these and
they're really really good guys and it's
I think these are whether you could
solve this up any way that you want to
either were distressed you with it or a
tank top to top whatever it's just an 8
so these are the next plants that I'm
going to show you guys that I think I've
showed these pants before in another
video now these are the Aphrodite brand
again and these are size 13 now I got
these in black just because I needed
some black ones for work so I want to
utilize them for work and just kind of
like play an outfit you want to saddle
up just with jeans with black jeans now
I did get other black pants on this
website but unfortunately they were way
too big for me so I had to send them on
back but they do have really nice to
stress side both black jeans as well too
so you definitely look into that now
these are just plain black pants and you
guys know what these are they sound like
the baby pockets on the back and they
really give you that that big booty type
of look like they really make your I
mean if you have already have a big butt
they're probably just emphasized it but
if you've got like a little but this
would definitely give you like that
really nice scoop on the bottom so you
definitely got a fatty in these so I
definitely like these they're
comfortable they're stretchy I mean like
these to me are like really sturdy I
guess like if you wear them a lot and
you wash them off and do kind of have
like a smiled wear and tear if you wear
them a lot they do expand a little bit
so that's sometimes I would get these in
a size 11 just because I know that they
will expand but my thighs have gotten
bigger so I just went up to size 13 and
I think that these are really cute and
you can wear these as like to go to an
interview to dress done you can do
whatever you want with you just because
they're black plain and simple BAM now
the next pants I want to show you guys
are these really cute kind of like dark
wash jeans not these Clark wash jeans on
one X and they're from the brand after
that again now these are really nice
because they distress that the kneecap
in the front now the distress of the
kneecap is very simple guys it's just
like a nice little cut in the front they
do have like the ends of the pants I
really want Jimmy they're kind of like
just a blunt cut at the end of the pants
and like even on the back adds like a
little bit of distressed to so it's just
kind of like a nice straight through cut
it's not like a it's a frayed cut that's
like I want to say afraid cut or
whatever now this is what I really like
about them is when you turn to the back
of the jeans it has a hole a cut of
distress cut in the back of the kneecap
which I thought was different because a
lot of jeans don't come like that now
these are high waisted jeans they look
very very nice on they do fit the body
well one thing I would say is add a belt
on if you have a smaller waist and it
doesn't kind of quite fit your waist I
didn't have a bucks handable to me so I
just just wore it the way it was but you
can definitely I like a nice accessory
belt on it to kind of bring in the look
a little bit and kind of stitch in the
waist just a little bit more but these
jeans were my favorite jeans I
definitely wear these with the heels and
kind of cut the leg up just a tiny bit
to kind of give it a little bit more sex
appeal and coolness but these were
really really nice and I really really
like these now this though the next pair
of jeans that I have to show you guys
are these painted these jeans from the
effort I brand again now these are size
extra large and they are really really
nice now this is more solve a lighter
wash with a nice wipe distress on it the
reason why I like these a lot is because
of the color like it's a little bit of a
lighter cut it's like a lighter denim on
top of the white de-stresses and it just
looks really really good with them any
type of piece like a nice white shirt
kind of tan shirt like those types of
colors you get anything so I really
thought that these are nice now these
are an extra large and they sit perfect
I've asked this before someone left of
the time before with the difference
between extra-large and 1x and I kind of
feel like they're the same they're just
kind of like I don't know I play through
the same but this one is marked
extra-large now these are really nice
the pockets are perfect it does have a
good stretch on it but what I can say
about these it's like a really really
good Jean material so that's one thing I
really like about this like the Jean
materials like
perfect but they are really comfortable
guys and they do have they don't they're
not cuff you can cut them at the bottom
if you want and it's kind of de-stress
like crazy all over sides I thought
these are really cute and like nice to
kind of style
these I'm going to show you how these
really cute distress ankle style jeans
now these are so cute guys and they are
frayed all the way down to the actual
kneecap part which I absolutely adore
now these are the after deck Branigan
and these are the size extra large now
these are very perfect guys if you want
to like I mentioned previously before
you can go in and add in about two kind
of cinch in your waist with these or you
can do darting I think that's what you
guys told me it's causing calls like you
can go to your local lady or get your
parent to do it your mother or whatever
a grandmother and they can just kind of
cinch the waist and kind of make it
smaller but these are like these are so
cute I've always one of these and it
can't the way they distress it really
gives you like that kind of like meaty
sexy thick look you know I'm saying my
extra tie out there and this will go
good with like a nice crop top tank top
body suit heels like I just saw so much
potential with this like I think that
these are so nice and they are very
inexpensive guys like I said you can
check out the website but like these
right here a plus like I just think that
these are it and I've always wanted
these I'm so happy I got my hands on it
finally these are kind of different it
seems like I'm getting all them that
kind of looks similar but I'm really not
because I made sure I watched out on the
website when I was taking these out now
this one has a different kind of a tinge
to it these are like the regular ones
out probably jump for but I want to try
these out now this is kind of like a
weird watch it's kind of like a dark
light kind of like off like wash and you
guys can tell I'm saying it's kind of
like dark like like real like white
light like it's just kind of like all
over the place but I wanted to try this
outfit because I thought that these were
pretty decent these are my kind of jeans
you could just wear with like a t-shirt
or like just kind of like a button-up
shirt or like overtimes button-up shirt
and just wear them it's not these are
like my first choice of jeans that I
pick up I wanted to pick them out to
show you guys that
you can wear any like type of jeans that
just kind of style them up it's not like
just because it looks like not your
style that's not going to work but I
thought that these were cute and some
people would really appreciate the
patter the the technique of their color
like I think that's pretty cool
they did distressed in the good areas
like right under your cheek right here
they got a little distress on the back
leg part so I thought these were cute
cold q and I definitely I'm going to
wear these I think that these will look
really nice and I can style this up to
my liking so I definitely thought that
these were great steel as well so lastly
I'm going to show you guys one of the
last jeans that I also got to and I
actually like these a lot
now these are a size extra large and
they are also part of the African I'm
starting to things like once like once I
got to the end of this video that all
the jeans are from the aphrodite brand
now if you familiar Alfred I bring like
I think fashion over carries it and I
also think Judy online carries it as
well it's a very popular brand and they
have perfect stretch perfect elasticity
just everything about it is perfect so
don't ever be afraid to buy ever tight
jeans in your size or size that yes to
buy them in your size basically so these
last ones are another pair of distress
these are one of my favorites to you
guys to just like how they distress this
one it is all the ways down it's like a
regular straight skinny leg pair of
jeans and it just has a perfect like
nice design on these I just thought that
these are really pretty guys just
because of the distress like I said I
like jeans that are distressed forward
and then have something in the back but
the reason why I like this is because
this one has no distress on the back and
just plain on the back and all the
action is in the front so it's just not
too much distraction going on all over
the place I thought it was a simple
distressed Jean to wear with sneakers or
heels whatever you want they are high
waisted and they're very simple jeans to
wear so I just thought that these are
cute and I wanted to show you guys these
and so guys that basically wraps up this
video I hope you guys enjoyed the pizzas
