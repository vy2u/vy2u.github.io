today with another curvy slash big grill
triangle now in today's video these
items are provided from fashion over
comm now I picked out a few items for
you guys and I'm really excited about
this video as you guys may know in the
past I haven't had a good relationship
with fashionable when it came to
purchasing their jeans but in today's
video I'll be showing you guys some
jeans from the curved collection that
fit perfectly now some of the pants were
a little bit big on the waist but
there's always ways to kind of
manipulate it to work I do have a dress
and a two-piece as well so everything is
going to be shown in this video and I'm
going to try it on for you as usual so
don't forget to do four important things
don't forget to leave your comments down
below like this video subscribe and also
share this video for more videos and I
would like you to stay tuned and keep
online alright guys so the first thing
I'm going to start off in the tall is
this really cute two-piece set that I
got now this two piece set is called
Netflix and chill set is a size large
and it's retailed at 3499 and it is in
the color khaki I call this more soulful
oatmeal color it's a really cute crop
top guys one thing I would say about
this cloud top is if you're like really
happy boobs like double D boob or like
large D boo that you'll probably get
some boobage leaking out just because it
cuts very high it is a really nice warm
color and it's definitely an airport
style on to peace which I liked the
pants are longer than colossal pants and
it does have a nice band on the waist
too so it kind of holds you it does
going to hold you in buttock space up
and said are you having to kind of like
wrestle with the pants to pull them up
it stays up pretty well and it looks
really good I love the length of it and
they fit perfect one thing that really
sold me on this is that these come with
pockets and I just love a pair of pants
with pockets pockets is like any type of
pants just works you don't have to you
could pull anything money sup like that
it's just like really um convenient
that's what I'm trying to say and I
thought this was cute looks good on the
body and if you want to even wear Spanx
with it whatever you want but it's
really relaxing outfit if you are my
size a kirby whatever you want to call
it then this will work for you and I
will mention that because I know
somebody does it ask
I'm 190 pounds and I am five five three
five four and a half inches tall so I am
that's but those are my those are my
stats I broke my stats I'll probably go
in and kind of measure myself around so
I could tell you guys exactly what I am
but that's what I am morbidly obese but
whatever I don't care I don't care about
BMI or any of that crap because that
 is all made up dump right back so
the next thing I got is it's really cute
sassy kind of it can be kind of like a
dress up or dress down tight at the type
of dress just because it's it's like
it's like sexy I feel like I can wear
this with sneakers and heels you get you
guys will get what I'm saying when I
want to put it on so this chest is
called let's see what is tunic and it's
in the color white is the size extra
large and it's retailed at 3499 now
fashion oh they're going to keep their
prices around the same number honestly
because it's honestly all the things are
probably around the same price so this
is kind of like a white tunic style
dress and I'm sorry to like he's coming
in and I'm is how you put white up to
you like especially if you're
african-american like you kind of like
it washed out with the color so my
colors coming back in now so this is the
dress right here guys it's really cute
at the white dress it does have it's
kind of like one of those if you're
curvy like me it kind of hits you in the
right spot Abeka cover your butt but it
kind of leaves like a little bit of a
kind of like a peekaboo areas on the
side and the vag part so I definitely
won't say wear Spanx with this when I
wouldn't recommend just walking out the
house when in being extra boldly it is
really cute on it's a lightweight style
shirt so you're not really heavy and you
don't you're not like dying in the
summer with this one definitely not you
can definitely wear this on like a 68
degrees 70 degree day you'll be
perfectly fine now it does the thing
they're going to sell this to me that it
comes with this cute cute like corset
piece that's attached to it and the good
thing about this corset pieces that it
has developed around the back so you can
snap it on and snap it off which I
thought was excellent and it does have
like this beautiful lace design on the
front pattern part and that does really
cool detail leather pattern on the
bottom as well and it really cinches you
in one thing I wish is that I would have
gotten this size well I wish I could
just respond you can size down
I'd like to criticize them but I prefer
being a
that loose I did wish that the belt was
a slipper small like a size large that
would have been a little better for me
just because it would have looked better
and it would have fit better but I'm
very pleased with that thing looks good
and like I said you can wear with tennis
shoes you can wear with heels and kind
of style upside down it just was just do
wonders like it's just do wonders and I
really think that this is I got two
pairs of jeans from fashion oh but now
these jeans are excellent I didn't
realize that I got them in the same
color but I prefer wearing kind of dark
style jeans
anyways I can kind of make my thighs
look a little bit bigger and leave for
comics ambles you know what I'm saying
like it just kind of draws a lot of
attention to your thighs I kid you were
like a light wash Jean but it has to be
like wholly in distress and kind of like
not obviously you know there I don't
know that's just me but I picked using a
dark wash now the first pair of jeans
I've got are they're both in the size 1x
the first one I got is called canopy
genes in their medium wash and they're
our size 1x and they're $44.99 now
they're really cute pair of jeans other
thing about these jeans is they have the
ultimate stylish or that's different
about these jeans is that it has a
cousin knee cap now these jeans fit very
very very very very very very very very
very very good
now you can definitely wear a crop top
with this you can wear I mean like you
couldn't just do cool you can go all in
there with this one you could wear a
freakin on body suit and now when I was
mentioning in the beginning video about
ways ways to style so if you have issues
with the jeans being too big and you
have like a smaller waist and you need
to about the actual waist part is a
little bit big what I used to do is get
a nice belt plain belt kind of like a
black belt you know just a black belt
you kind of gather the pants up and try
your hardest to kind of get the belts
and get the belt to cinch it in and most
of the time it'll gradually look good
like that what I also thought about
doing is just going into the like a
little old lady and having her kind of
fixed waist for me it's not going to
cost that much money but if you really
these jeans aren't for the good quality
jeans so I definitely consider going to
get the side put pulled in a little bit
because it's worth it now these right
here fit absolutely like this you listen
the many times I've ordered jeans or
fashion of and has just been a
this is definitely a win like these are
like this is it right here so I'm very
happy with these jeans they retard at
$44.99 I used I bought jeans from
American Eagle and they fit for some
reason American Eagle will fit me like I
could fit a size 12 in American English
in these kind of feel like American
Eagle jeans and American Eagle jeans are
about $30 $35 and this kind of reminds
me of them in a way I don't know why
even though they're not like super like
stylish and high waisted like this it
just has I get like a memory flash of
the quality of the jeans so these are
definitely a plus like and I'm just this
common so the next jeans I got are these
other one exercise jeans now these are
called the beach bum jeans they're
medium blue and they're inside 1s and
these are $37.99 now I bought these
originally before like before this whole
review thing I bought these in a size 15
now the 15 fit but the 15 was tight
emphasized like I have a large size so
it's it's a lot of work putting jeans on
to begin with but my just mind I was
like a lot of rubbing I just I was
uncomfortable with that price I can't
like do a high kick and jeans I'm not
wearing it so these jeans I could
definitely do a high kick in these these
are great now these are the pair of
jeans that I noticed our a little bit
bigger on the waist area so I definitely
will go in and get a little old lady a
little old lady to go in and kind of
sold it by kind of like make this a
little bit more tighter or bring in the
waist a little bit but these are cute
these are super distressed you get like
a humongous hole right here and some
patterns patches there too and these are
kind of cuff for me I probably will wear
a copper pipe what we're cops the dance
about cuffs jeans is that you can wear a
nice heel with it and look really classy
well not classy you can work you can
dress it up or dress it down and wearing
heels will kind of de-stress skinny-leg
jeans look so sexy to me and like a body
suit so that's definitely brainstorming
in my head this summer any season
honestly to say the two but I thought
that these were really cute guys and I
definitely had to pick these out so this
is my session of experienced guys I'm
actually very pleased even though these
items were sent to me for a review I'm
not just going to come over here and
feed you guys because that's
just not what I do but I am very happy
with the jeans is the first time that
I've gotten jeans recession over and I
have not been disappointed you cannot go

perfect items guys and I'm just super
super pleased so make sure you guys
