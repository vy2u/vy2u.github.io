so today is going to be another curvy
plastic girl triangle so I'll be showing
you guys some products from Primark
romwe fashion or forever 21 and more so
in today's video I mixed it up a little
bit so I'm going to be showing you guys
some clothing items shoes accessories
and makeup so if you're interested in
seeing what I have to offer today I
would like you to stay tuned and keep on
watching so I'm going to start off with
is this two-piece that I got from romwe
calm so it's basically like a crop top
sweatshirt thing with kind of like the
steak and datas inspired stripes on the
side it does come with the skinny
legging style pants with the same
pattern now this outfit is really cute
guys I just think it's like really
sporty and you can wear with sneakers
and kind of style it up if you're bold
enough or if you want to be sassy you
can wear heels within a rocket that way
I got this one in the size large and
when I first got it I thought that it
was going to be way too small for me but
fortunately it fit perfectly and I was
like super super excited about that and
this I will leave all the links down
below for these items so don't be
worried about that
but this outfit is really cute and
sporty you can wear it any style the way
you want and it just really really works
so the next thing I got is this little
dress it's not a little dress I
accidentally got in size 2x and I could
have gotten in size large but when
you're shopping on these asian-based
websites you got to be kind of careful
because some items fit like a Chinese
like they like an Asian size and Asian
people are not no offense to an agent
who are really thin most agency were
thin so they kind of have their items
like really really for thin people so I
picked this in a size 2 X and it's kind
of like this oversized dress and the
oversize just is a gray color and it
comes with this belt so basically what I
had to do was belt it and then kind of
like pull the shirt over and kind of
scrunch it together to make it work I
thought it was a really cute dress
though guys it's really sporty and you
can rock it with tennis sneakers and
just like really boring sandals or like
kind of plain sandals and just make it
look really nice so I definitely like
this one and I definitely would style
this up and you guys will see how I did
it you can style it up several ways to
make it look better like putting a
jacket on putting a hat you know
switching up your hair so I'm all about
that kind of stuff but you guys will see
so the next thing I got is this arm one
arms bodysuit now this was kind of
strange for me because I didn't know
to put the body suit on properly like
the arm situation was kind of weird for
me and I just didn't get it but I kind
of figured it out and guess you guys
could let me know but I thought it was
really cute cause it's like a
one-shoulder bodysuit and it's black it
does have this snap clasp on the bottom
so you can if you went to the bathroom
you to urinate you can just pop it open
and use the bathroom you don't have to
take the whole thing off it's really
cute like want off the shoulder like one
shoulder and it just thought it was like
really nice to wear with like a skirt
jeans I just really like that with heels
or something just keep making it outfit
a casual up into a really sexy outfit so
I definitely recommend picking this one
out this one is really really cute guys
now that and that one was actually in a
size large now the last thing that I got
from romwe are these really trendy
glasses and before I put them on I might
have to clean them because you're really
staining because I was like just playing
around with them lately so these classes
are really trendy right now they're kind
of like that glare lens glasses now I
really think that these are totally cute
guys I think like fashion-forward
because everyone is kind of rocking
these down and I kind of not I wasn't
living into that to sort of look as -
it's too cliche too trendy or whatever
but I definitely pick these out on
runway just because I was like let me
try these out and I absolutely love
these they look so cute and they make
they look kind of really hip and stuff
so I was like damn these are really
popping and you know you go ahead to get
them and I think this is the gold
version they do have a rose gold version
in this too but they're totally bitchin
and I look totally - you and me so yeah
these are definite like a summer summer
look guys so definitely check romli out
for this stuff because I definitely
enjoyed all the items that they sent me
so huh
and so now I'm going to show you guys
some stuff from Primark now I got this
really cute book back from Primark now
this book rack is really cute because
it's kind of like one of those bomber
jackets material book bags and it has
like this really cute leather pleather
accent on it I am traveling so I wanted
to wear something that was simple
nothing like a big purse
carry on with me so I thought the book
bag look really cute and I just it was
only $11 11 or $12 I picked it up I was
like hey why not
it does have enough space inside of it
so I could fit things that I need to fit
in it so I was like you know what I'm
going to try this one on this trip just
because we're doing
virgins and stuff like that and I wanted
to have something that I could like
actually hold on to instead of carrying
a bag or like one of those body bags so
this was twelve dollars and I thought it
was a really really good deal now the
next thing I want to show you guys are
some really cute Skippy's that I died I
don't really think I'm going to wear
these on the trip just because they're
white and I don't want to get them
messed up or dirty or whatever so I
picked up these white Skippy's from
Primark and they're really really cute
they are white colors just like your
regular Skippy's kind of like adidas
aspire Skippy's and they were only seven
dollars and I got them in the u.s. size
9 and then a UK size 7 I thought thought
they were good still just really what
nice white tennis shoes to wear an
ex-player I picked up two accessories
now these are tube and an accessory
headbands you can wear them as it had
been or you can actually wear them
around your neck for style so I usually
wear this to run my head because I just
liked it so let me show you guys how I
would really stylist so usually wear it
just like this just because I like that
whole little 90s not 90s 50s inspired
look so I usually wear it like this on
my head so I picked this one out and
these were 250 I got a black one and a
burgundy one and if you watched my
previous videos before I also have like
a red one that I think is really cute
and it's not gang-related people so so
the next things I got are these two nice
crop tops
now the crop tops are kind of like that
cool stretch material crop top this one
is in a color like turquoise green and I
got these in a size US 8 they're really
cute crop top nothing like too crazy I
got in a black and this turquoise green
color I thought they're really nice
they're super stretchy and they look
good you don't have to wear a bra with
it you can actually go full exposure and
if you mean like it's something simple
that you don't have to get all crazy
with it
and these were only four thousand fifty
cents so I definitely have to pick these
up so the next thing I got was this
really cute pinstripes
kind of a dress now it's a really long
dress and it's kind of like an
off-the-shoulder style dress but this
one actually comes with two straps on it
so that you kind of have a little bit of
support if you have larger breasts it
does have an elastic cinch for the waist
so therefore if it is a little bit
bigger you want accentuate your waist
you can actually tie it up and make it a
little bit more tighter
I think that this is so cute to wear
just like plain sandals and just kind of
styled up with some jewelry or whatever
it's really cute and this was only
fourteen dollars in Primark so it was
definitely a steal especially because
I'm going away so I just cannot give
this one up I just thought that guys
like this is this is cute so definitely
check that out our primer the next thing
I got is it's really cute pink floyd tee
it's like it's rock Fanti now the reason
where I like this a lot because it comes
with the cutout in the front and then
you get a little bit of its collar piece
hanging I thought that this was really
cute guys it is it is in a size let's
see it is in a size 10 and it is fits
perfectly it's kind of one of those
ashley to a black t-shirt worn out looks
and the logo is pretty as well guys I
thought it was cute it's a cute shirt
just to wear with the jeans I read
libyans of sneakers so I definitely
picked it or not because it was a deal
this was only $11 I believe it was only
11 bucks so yeah so I definitely had to
pick this one up so the last well not
the last thing so a couple makeup
accessories that I got were really cool
so I picked up some lipstick from
Primark makeup selection and now make a
selection makeup section yeah so I
picked up a few lipsticks in an eyeliner
now I've been really into that blue
eyeliner look so I picked up a cool
looking eyeliner and it's blue and it's
from what allows this a mega liner so I
definitely have to pick this one out
because I just thought that it was so
pretty so I will swatch and show you
guys what it looks like this is really
nice guys it was about a $2.00 and I was
just like yeah I gotta get I got to have
this one the one that I had previously
my videos kind of dried out so I was
like I need to get a new one so I had to
pick this one up now I did go in and get
the Milani lip colors as well that the
Milani lip cause I only got two I got
one of the metallic lip creams and then
I just got one of the regular style ones
now the more matte one the metallic lip
color is in the color number 10 pretty
problematic this is really nice because
it's matte and it has a nice frost to it
I really thought this would be cute for
the summertime so I picked it out Reds
are usually like Reds berries and
chocolates are usually colors for like
the spring well you definitely can't
transition these into the summer in
spring so I definitely have to get this
one and I will swatch this one for you
guys as well
now the next Milani one I got is just
the regular more matte lipcream now I
got this one in the color 19 cousin and
this one is like a pretty pretty
chocolate brown color and I just thought
it was so nice against my skin so I
definitely have to pick this one out
because it was just too fabulous and if
I didn't mentioned these were $8.99 so
these were not like a discounted they're
like a regular price like the regular
like if you go on their website just a
regular price these don't change and I
don't think anyone sells them for
cheaper than that maybe walking doesn't
$14.99 I think I'm not sure but the
price really doesn't change for the for
the Milani they don't ever go on sale so
the next thing I got is a Jordana sweet
cream matte lip color now these are new
and these are actually really affordable
guys I picked this up at at Primark and
it was like $2 or $2.99 and I just
thought this is great now this color
that I got is the number 21 and molten
chocolate cake this is so so pretty guys
I think it's like a really nice like a
mix between brown and red so it's kind
of like if I can think of a cause that I
have in my collection that's like this
it's kind of like a mix like it's like a
red velvet cake to me that's what I was
on so it's not really chocolate molten
chocolate cake it's more like a red
velvet cake but a little bit more
chocolate in it so I just really thought
that this was cute guys it's just a nice
color like I said to transition into
this for spring in summer so it
definitely has to look this one out and
these aren't really matte in their
excellent so got this cool brush from
Primark it's kind of it's a double
blended stippling brush and it has two
sides to it kind of has like a small
brush side and a big brush side I just
got this for three dollars because I
usually use this for like my foundation
I use a big side for like the liquid
part and then I'll use the small side
for like kind of stippling and some
powder just to kind of map me up and
this was only $3 I couldn't let this go
so I just picked it up now the next
thing I got with some accessories I got
some MIDI rings and I'm usually not a
silver person but I picked these up for
a 4050 set they're really cute I love
this a little design on the ring so I
was like you know what I have to get
this and it you know with a fresh
Medicare it just looks so good so I was
like you know what I'm just going to get
these even though they're not gold they
are silver put the design on them are
particularly pretty stars just like I'm
going to get this I also got a pack of
chill furs and I really like
these chokers a lot now they were only
$4.50 I will show you guys up close what
they look like and you kind of get like
a variation of gold rose gold and like a
little bit of pearl design in it I just
thought they were cute especially for
festivals and stuff I like to
accessorize a lot like I'll have my name
plate and then I'll put some chokers on
with it so I just thought it was really
cute so I had to pick this one up as
well so the next thing I got was sent
from someone on YouTube now this person
on YouTube her name is candy sweets and
I'll link her channel down below so she
owns a company called the barb life and
she kind of sells custom frontals hair
extensions eyelashes and her lashes are
100% mink lashes so they're like
tippity-top
now she sent me some lashes and they are
absolutely gorgeous guys now she has her
own YouTube channel and if you go check
her out she does hair reviews makeup
tutorials and all that kind of stuff so
she's definitely on and poppin on this
YouTube life so I definitely want to
tell you guys to go out and check her
Channel now these lashes are absolutely
gorgeous guys I honestly and honestly
these are like the best lashes like they
give you complete fullness and complete
de venise evenness Jesus yet whatever
and these lashes that I got are called
iron sorry and I just think that these
are fabulous they are probably like the
perfect combination of what I like I
don't like my lashes too too thick but I
feel like my lashes too too thin and
these are just perfect for what I'm
looking for so it's definitely going to
check her web site and also check her
YouTube channel
al she's really great and she's a really
nice person guys and yeah so I
definitely featuring this in a
up-and-coming makeup tutorial so stay
tuned for that place I picked some items
up from because I had a gift card laying
around with fashion over comm now I
picked two regular basic things out this
first America it's really cute kind of
like summer dress it is kind of one of
those stretchy dresses the tube top
dresses but this one has like little
quarter length sleeves on attached to it
I thought that this was really cute and
something that you can just wear in the
summer time on a trip to the airport
something real basic and cute that you
could put on this was about weather 129
or $25 and I just picked it up and I
thought it looks really good fits nice
you don't have to wear a bra you don't
have to wear strapless bra you can just
put it on and go
so I had to pick this out and I got this
limit in the size I believe size at
large so it definitely fits perfectly
and it does exactly what I need to do
you can style it minimally with like a
little bit of jewelry I usually am
wearing a ton I just wear my nameplate
and that's it the next day are from
fashion OVA is this little bralette now
in the beginning when I saw this broaden
on the website I thought it was cute
however and it's not it's too much
exposure with this one like you have to
be I'm not saying out to be the boldest
bitch but you have to be like slender or
small boobage like this thing is shown a
lot and like for me I would actually
have to wear this with kind of like a
plaid teacher over a plaid shirt or like
maybe like an oversized jean jacket and
leg jeans or something like this is not
something I would just wear like that
and it's what I'm like tempted to give
it to my sister but it is manageable
like you definitely could rock this in
the summertime with like a really
minimal outfit and make it look slave
full but it's really really like hoochie
like really you know I'm sings like
really like like spandexy so I'm just
kind of like it's like an empty
situation with that top but like I'm
eventually going to wear it I'm not
saying I'm not going to read because I'm
not bold enough to wear I just feel like
it's really skimpy and they could have
did a better job with the material on
that one but I'm going to try it on
anyways so this is the only item that I
picked up from forever 21 now this is a
really simple bodysuit I just selected
because the material is really nice the
reason why the material is nice is
because the material is very thick so if
you're like if you don't want to be all
jiggly and Wiggly and like all kind of
like flappy all over the place this
would ever give you some support if you
want to wear body garments underneath
there or anything like that this would
definitely suck you in now this was only
twelve thousand ninety cents that I got
in this size medium and it's just like a
really basic ass tank top it does cut
kind of like right here so it kind of
gives your boobs a little bit of more it
gives it boobs a little bit of a style
or look kind of like like a little boob
at the top here I really thought that
this was cute this is cheap and it does
have a clasp on the bottom of this body
too so if you have to use the bathroom
you just unhook it and there you go so
that's one thing I really like about
body suits it's a must to have that it
does have adjustable straps
you can adjust it and this is something
you can wear with jeans high-waisted
skirts shorts or whatever and it could
just turn into a good look so I
definitely picked this one up and they
only had in a black if they had it in
white or tan I definitely would pick
those up too but I only found black so
bummer but this works so guys that
basically wraps up this video I know
wasn't the longest video but it's not
the shortest video but I hope you guys
