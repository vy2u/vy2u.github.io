with another crappy plastic grill trying
huh now in today's video I'll be showing
you guys some items from shitty online
Road gaol and Happiness boutique so I
try to do like a little mix today I got
some clothing items some accessories and
some jewelry so it's going to be pretty
interesting so I hope you guys enjoy
this one don't forget to thumbs up this
video guys we've already comments down
below and also hit that subscribe button
if you haven't already and I want you to
stay tuned and keep on watching so the
first company that I'm going to set up
with for this review is Ginny online now
Junie online is kind of like one of your
fashion OVAs type of situations
now this company's based out of Miami
Florida and they have like really nice
outfits for plus-size women regular
sized women and just about any type of
woman so they do have a wide variety of
ranges and stuff on style and sizes so I
really like this and I'm going to go at
this company way before they even
contacted me to work with them now one
thing I'm going to say is that without
the tab from the company if you're
purchasing something they will not do
returns exchange or refund so make sure
that if you're returning any items from
this cup to this company you have the
pink tag attached to the clothes so I
got four items from them and I'm pretty
satisfied and pretty pleased because
they're not some things are some pretty
cute stuff so the first thing I picked
out was this green tea now this is like
a distressed green tea
now don't forget guys everything will be
linked down below so don't worry you
will know where these items are so the
first thing I got is just really choose
distress tea now when I need to stress
me I mean distress the t-shirt is
distressed all the way down to the
bottom and on the sleeves and the
shoulders and all that kind of stuff and
it's kind of like a skull head and
inside it don't even know what the hell
this says girl
it says jump wait I don't even know what
it does but it's a really cute cute tee
and you know how distressed tees are
really in style so I picked this one up
as I was at one somebody cute on me so
I'm just going to get it any damn way so
I got this in a size large now the next
item I got is a cute little backless
it's not really like a backless dress it
has like a low back and it's kind of one
of those cute dresses that comes with a
two amazingly sexy splits now this is
the color mocha and this is also size
charge I thought that this just was cute
I am going away and three months I'm
going like in the next three months I'm
traveling a lot so I want to toss some
items for like expecting some going to
islands and stuff like that so I wanted
to have something really nice this is a
really pretty dress guys I think it
complements my Coco skin very well and
I'm definitely going to rock this one
like really like rock this I thought
that this was a really nice shed it does
have a two long splits in the front too
long splits towards the side of your
thighs so if you I would recommend
wearing undies with this or something I
don't wear undies I would say we're
undies with this one just because you
don't want to catch you slippin but it's
a really cute dress is very very sexy
now the next thing I got from that is
this amazing two-piece suit now in the
beginning when I first picked this out
was kind of wary that it wouldn't work
with my body like just because it's like
certain things like if you're like
really cellulite or you really like a
thick like certain pieces just don't
work well because you're just like
really really like I'm just joking but
like I just didn't think that this would
look good because of what my thighs and
all that lotta stuff of that so I tried
this one on it I got in a size large
taking a risk I got a size large and
this is so cute so it's like a two-piece
bell-bottoms about paisley pattern
two-piece and comes with this really
cute crop top and it's just like so cute
very it's like very beachy very summery
you definitely wear this out with
sandals you don't have to get all fancy
schmancy with this all you wear with
sandals and rock it really nice I
thought this one was so so so cute and
this is a size large and I will link to
down below for anyone it does have
amazing stretch so that's one reason why
it fits well if it didn't have good
stretch I would be in major major
trouble
but this one's definitely had like
perfect stretch so I was all set with
this one and I just thought it was
fabulous now the last thing I got from
them are these cool distressed jeans now
they have jeans from the same brand and
I'm going to say this I'm not want to
come at Fashion OVA cut
I don't work for them and I mean like
I'm not partner with them or anything
yet but SAS Innova has the same brand
genes and this is a vibrant brand now I
okay like this is this is going to be
like the weirdest combination I'm going
to try to say this quick and cool so
that I don't get my golf offended or
offensive to fashion over but I try to
fashion I wear size 11 12 depending on
the stretch now fashion dope with jeans
like the regular size dream jeans will
not fit me I can't even try a regular
size 15 jeans will not fit my thighs my
god it just doesn't fit and it will fit
it like zip up and everything and this
is size 15 but I'm uncomfortable I
refuse to wear those jeans especially
the high-waisted jeans I would think in
my head that ok this was going to fit me
no no it just doesn't fit like it's
really disappointing and discouraging to
be honest with you so I decided to shop
in the plus X section for this company
now I originally ordered in the 1x but
I'm happy they sent me an extra-large
because that 1x would have been bigger
slob so they sent me these really cute
distress jeans
now the thing I like about these jeans a
lot are their legs the legs are
distressed all the way down it's a very
tight ankle style these jeans are so
ready
like I think these are so cute I stay at
a size large I could do a side large but
they don't think that have a size large
I didn't know the head size extra large
so they send me the extra large they
probably make a better judgment than I
did so I got an extra large and these
are B they're high-waisted very good
they're not stiff they have real pockets
in our superficial pockets these are
just oh my god like if you're if you
have trouble buying jeans and fashiona
with jeans aren't really cutting it for
you I would say go on this website and
look for it at their plus size section
jeans and try to manage I told one X
with a Simon extra-large so I'm not sure
if there's you have it in the drop bar
but they do carry now that in those
extra large in these pants and these
pants aren't amazing amazing so
the next thing I want to show you guys
are these awesome necklaces that I got
from a company and Julie company claw
happiness bootie
now the first necklace I got is a cut as
a rose gold necklace now let me show you
guys what it looks like first and then
I'll explain it to you so this is
basically what it looks like it's like a
cute little square box necklace it's
very nice it's rose gold now the reason
why I like this alive is because with
this necklace it has like little sayings
around the cube it has wisdom belief
courage and luck
I just thought those were really cute I
love necklaces like this especially if
you guys know I wear my name necklace
all the time and my necklace is from my
name necklace calm so if you're
interested in that I'll link that below
too but I love these little necklaces
with kind of like little words and
meanings or something like that just I'm
just into that so I really like this one
now the next one I got is one of those
double layered chain necklaces and this
one is cute because it's gold and I am a
gold part that I love gold jewelry it's
just my thing I love gold I'm not really
too much of a silver person other than
earrings but I love gold so this is this
be like the - it's like a layered
necklace it comes with these cute little
little circles or whatever to kind of
give you the layered effect I just
thought it was cute and simple this is
gold and I just I don't know if
something about it was cute the whole
layered necklace thing is really in
right now so I wanted to kind of do that
I usually like buying jewelry for the
summer because in the summertime you
really kind of like are bare with tank
tops and stuff like that so adding a
little bit of fun accessories like that
definitely is my thing so I just left
these okay guys so less but not least is
rose calm now I got sent three clothing
items some accessory three necklace and
some kind of like fun accessories that I
selected just because I liked it now let
me start off with the clothes first um
so yeah so the first thing I got is this
jean dress now this is kind of like a
doll baby style dress I try this on guys
and it would disappoint the dress fits
but I kind of feel like if it's
supposedly in the plus-size section
especially because this is an extra
large
it shouldn't be too tight I couldn't
even blend it past my boobs up here like
the part where the breast part words
that I could have button it and the arms
are a little bit snug but not too bad
where I could estimate
I just had trouble biting the dress up
when it came to my breasts and I just
did it I just didn't like that about
this dress
but I thought it was really cute dress
it does kind of give you the prego
the prego Lego look so and I just was
kind of like bitch I'm not
pregnant but I thought this dress is
cute though so guess what I'm going to
do give it away so if you're interested
in this dress I will actually give this
dress away to one subscriber so like
last time I asked you guys to pick a
number so I'm going to text to do that
again because that was seemingly well I
was actually surprised about how many
people guessed the number I chose let's
see this time if I can get it the first
number that I see that's the correct
number will be the number of the winner
and it's zero to a hundred so I'm going
to actually give this just away because
I'm not going to is it you know I'm
saying so this just will go away to one
of my lucky subscribers then actually
another item may go as well so I won't
tell you guys the other item but
remember I won't tell you guys the other
item but there will be two items that
someone will win from this clothing haul
so make sure you enter in for this one
as well now the next dress that I have
is this cute awesome dress now this one
is a bit short guys but I do like it I'm
into like these cute floral Paisley kind
of dresses this one is a royal blue
color with a kind of like a weird little
floral design on it it's not really just
stick with the floral design I just
thought that it was really really cute
now this is a dress not a robber it does
have a time of front and it's off the
shoulders however the dress is short now
short for me maybe short for some of you
guys do however if I want to be risque
and I'm like I know right now my wife is
going to be like bitch no but yes no
bitch no I hate like bitch no I'm like
boy yes I'm definitely gonna wear this
when I go away
I mean I'm protected by my friends I was
going to come runnin up on me real quick
but I'm Jessie's going to wear this out
when I go maybe to Mexico it's really
cute this is really really cute so I
really want to rock this out for Mexico
I think it'll go so cute with some sand
a little hat but I think it's cute but
it's just too short for my body type so
if you we don't have similar body types
and you a little bit skinnier on the leg
part a little bit leaner than I than me
then you'll get away with this but this
is definitely cute now then the last
clothing item I got is this cute wrap
dress now it's kind of like in this
pepto-bismol color and I didn't know
it's going to come this pepto-bismol
color but evidently you did now it is
cue and I'm not gonna throw shade on it
it's kind of like a nice polyester /
satin like want to be set materials not
really satin satin
it is a bright purplish-pinkish color of
pepto-bismol color it's really nice this
is a size I believe this is a size large
this is a size large I think it's really
cute it's very sexy and very simple this
is the type of dress that you're going
to like a wedding like a quick wedding
or like a quick ceremony graduation or
whatever you can just get away with
wearing this it's not short I would say
wear something underneath that will
cover so you don't have any you know I
want to wear it on with the summer kind
of work for panties because this is type
of dress to go into your butt crack so I
would just be careful with this one is
it trying to go to like a socially
appropriate place you know I would have
where to sit the club though and I
didn't go through the club but I want to
wear this to go out like that I went to
a graduation maybe like a dinner date or
something simple but it's really cute
and it's a wrap dress and it wraps
once's always fit the body right okay
guys so the last few items that are
jewelry items now this first one is the
necklace guys now this is a really cute
necklace it kind of is like an EKG
reading with a heart attached to the end
of it I thought this is really cute
especially because you know I'm like med
savvy so I just thought it was a really
cute statement necklace especially
because of the length is kind of like a
choker style necklace so like I wear my
name necklace I could just put this on
and rock it like that so I definitely
thought that this was cute then next
necklace I got is another layer necklace
layering necklaces are in so sorry guys
I'm not killing you with you layering
necklaces so this laying necklace is a
little bit different it has like little
diamonds on the each layer and this is
triple layered so it has a diamond on
so I just thought that this was really
cute and I love gold accents so this was
kind of like one of my favorites when I
saw it on the website so I'm definitely
going to rock this one pretty heavy now
the last necklace I got once again is a
layered necklace now I know you guys
probably why she thought to review
necklace legitimately these necklaces on
the website were like three bucks like
how can you be three dollars for a
necklace like that's like a good-ass
deal so that's mainly the reasons why I
chose these methods because they were
very inexpensive and if you're looking
to buy an expensive jewelry this website
does have inexpensive jewelry
now this one is also another double a
necklace but the problem is my systems
all messed up so this one has a triangle
Penman and it also has this little gold
medallion type of style and I guess the
medallion goes first and then the
triangle goes second but this one is all
raveled like a mixed up but it's really
cute guys I thought that this was cute
the concept is cute so I picked that one
as well so the last two items it's
actually three items but obviously I'm
going to show you what I got doubles of
this one so these are kind of basically
like body tattoos I love these two body
tattoos when I went to a dr for
Valentine's weekend I kind of like put
these body tattoos on because I just
thought it looked cute my bathing suit
so I thought kind of like a gold one a
gold body tattoo art ding I thought that
this was really cute and it also got
like a regular black one which it has
like kind of like these are the designs
on it I thought that this was pretty
cute as well as let me show you here so
warm side by side so these two were
really awesome so I picked these two out
because I just thought like you know if
you want to accessorize a little bit
engage like a little bit of extra glam
with your swimwear and stuff like that
these two items definitely go very well
so that basically wraps up my video I
