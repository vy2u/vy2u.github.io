today so today's video is going to be
another Kirby slash big girl trying all
video non today's video I'll be
featuring she inside romwe and andy club
where now there are all the items that
I'm showing you guys I pretty much like
them some items I did have to send back
to the company just because I really
wasn't feeling it but for the most part
everything that I'm going to show you I
was pretty much satisfied with to an
extent like some things I'll just say a
little bit you know fine like it's not
but a lot of these items aren't you're
able to work with it and that's a very
very good plus now I will leave down all
the links to the items down below and if
there is a coupon code it would be in
the video somewhere or I will link it
down below in the description bar as
well now do not forget to like this
video guys leave your comments down
below and hit that subscribe button for
more videos guys and if you're
interested in seeing what I have to
offer today I would like you to stay
tuned and keep on live shaker so the
first place I'm going to start off with
ami club where now they did send me a
bunch of items but some of the items I
didn't really like and they didn't look
good so I haven't sent back so I kept a
few items that I thought were pretty
good pretty consistent with summer
fashion and whatever so the first thing
I picked out were these shorts now these
shorts are pretty pretty short for me I
never really like wearing shorts this
small but I thought these work use a
nice light wash and they were distressed
so I wanted to pick these out I got
these in a size extra large and they're
kind of like feeling really good cutter
pants now when I wear these types of
jeans the only problem with this is
because my waist is like a little bit
small but it's not that small my waist
is just a little bit tiny the back is
all I'm always having get a like gaps in
the back which I really don't like so
for these pants I definitely have like a
nice gap in the back of it so with these
jeans out with these shorts I would
probably have to wear a belt which sucks
because I hate wearing belts with shorts
is just kind of weird so probably not do
is just wear shirts that kind of covers
my back a little my butt a little bit so
that I don't have to do all the extra
stuff they are very short guys and I
just love the distress pattern and it's
very nice and soft
they're very stretchy stretchy pants
short so you can definitely get away
getting like a good size I got a size
extra large if your mind said to get
extra large of unit 1x 2x whatever it is
would fit but if you're not someone that
likes to wear things that are really
sure I don't suggest wearing these
because these really cut really really
underneath the ass cheeks oh but they're
too and they were very inexpensive too
now the next thing I got is this kind of
like see-through top now I didn't try
that some of the broad I just quickly
tried on afraid again because it wasn't
something that you know like I would go
crazy about I probably wear this to the
beach and the cover-up just because I
thought it was choose to wear with the
bathing suit underneath it now it does
have that cool floral print on it and
this is really in season right now and
another reason why I got is because of
this kind of like sporty neckline that
ahead and it is see-through and it does
have like that hemmed line that line
what do you call that you know what
I mean
so I thought it was really nice and like
I said I would wear this as a cover-up
with a bikini or something like that
just to wear to the beach just because
it does have a little bit of a fashion
to it but it's cease doing I'm just not
like a really too much of a see-through
person that much but I thought it was
cute so I definitely picked this one out
now the next thing I got our two rappers
now then to our I thought was cute
trying to be on trend still I got
another rapper with that floral design
this one is kind of like a black chiffon
style or kind of like it's like a
chiffon style dress romper it is really
cute I got to sit a size extra large and
it fits perfectly it does have a nice
back piece that comes out so you can
show your back a little bit but what
really sold me was the pattern on the
front it's the same exact pattern as the
last one I showed you but I thought this
was really cute just because it's in
trend it's black and it just it's a it's
great for the silhouette it looks really
good and you can just wear this with
sandals to grow with convert sneakers
and just rock it out and make it real
look really cute and simple so I hope
you thought this is nice it's not too
short either so if you're someone that
doesn't like short short stuff this one
will look really really good I could
wear this when I go to LA Jamaica any
music festival and it'd just be perfect
now the last one I got is one of my
favorites I just like it because of the
coloring now they didn't have this one
in the set did it you know what is this
a size extra large I'm not sure yeah
this one's size extra large and I kind
of felt like it wasn't a real extra
large it's all out the sides large
because it did really stick to me but
this is really cute guys and it's just
basically you'll see when it comes up on
the screen
it's so cute has like a Thai breast part
in the front and it's like shorten it
it's short it's really really sure my
life and it kind of has like these bat
wings on it too and things are really
swimming on this is the pattern the
pattern is really really pretty
it's a nice purple pink like all these
colors that complement each other are
mixed into this piece
the only thing else about it is it's a
size extra large but it's really it's
really tight so you got like if you got
big subway arms like foot long arms like
you're gonna have a hard time kind of
like pulling through I just I feel kind
of I barely got mines on my arm so I
would definitely say if they did have
the cinah size 1x I definitely would
recommend if you're my size to get a 1x
this is kind of tight for me so I could
just imagine other people who are my
size trying to on it's kind of like
it like but I thought it was cute and
I'm going to try to tone up a little bit
move like 5 or 10 pounds before I go to
Jamaica because I was never into Jamaica
with me in July so hopefully I can swing
down a little bit and I could slide
right up in this one with no problem but
this is one of my favorites from any
club where it's just so F and cute guys
so the next place I'm going to show you
answer machine side comm now Cheers
sighs calm and like Rahui calm I kind of
feel like there's sister companies to be
honest with you so all the things are
going to be kind of similar but not
really really similar and retro spread I
do kind of pick out separate things
obviously but this they have the kind of
same material the same kind of concept
of fashion so you'll see what I'm
talking on now the first thing I got is
this jean dress now this is a tank top
jean dress it's kind of like a wrap
dress when I first picked this I was
skeptical because I didn't know what
kind of material is gonna get and they
only had a size large I believe the
highest size of size large so I'm really
winged this one however the dress does
fit but the problem with the dress it is
short as hell now if I was being bold
enough where I wanted to be risque
I would wear it but I definitely have to
put shorts underneath it like some type
of Spanx or something because this is
just kind of like an appropriate ass but
it is really cute to wrap just it is
like Jean material it's not like that
fake jimothy hmm
it probably is but
not too much of that big G material but
it is really nice guys it does give you
a good silhouette it just should have
been a little bit softer Jean material
just because then it really what it gave
you a better looking silhouette but it
does well it does get you don't have to
wear a bra we could just wait you know
just if you have flat chest big big
breasts whatever it just kind of hold
you in so you're not going flopping all
over where you have to have like a titty
action out or whatever so it definitely
does work I think this is cute guys and
I'm definite about this one and I'm
definite about this one now the second
thing I got was a two-piece now I know
you don't know about business the
summertime why did you get this I only
got this because I like the material or
the look of it so this is a two-piece
and it's kind of like sweatpants and a
hoody but it is army fatigue now I
thought this was really cute on the
website and I got a size large in this
one but me getting a size large in this
one because it's stretch I already knew
that it was going to fit now this is
really cute guys it definitely makes
your buns look really nice and the top
is a really nice top to is just a
regular crew neck and it's like it's the
material so nice even if you're like
sick or whatever and you think that when
I know you guys know and you guys are
going to know what I'm talking about
like when you were like legging material
and your thighs are bigger you actually
and it's like a pattern type of legging
material your thighs are so big that
they stretch them the pattern out and it
looks a mess I thought that this is
going to be the Kitsch for this one just
because it kind of looks like a cheap
pattern but disclaimer this is like the
best quality sweat suit I've seen so my
size don't like I'm not getting like
that guy look at me so it looks really
good and the pattern stays and it just
looks really good
this was probably one of my favorites
from she inside to be honest with you
guys but I do have another one that is
pretty good too but for this outfit I
really visualized to guys and I
definitely wear this to the airport or
whatever it's just really really cute
now the last thing I got from them is
distressed now in the beginning I was
skeptical about suggestions because I
was like like when I first tried it on
the bottoms
it's like see-through when the bottoms
just didn't fit like the panty part was
like hard to snap on because it's kind
of like a body suit in a way now I got
this one and a size let's see because
sometimes these damn tanks gonna be on
here I got this one in a size large
now I
a very skeptical about this one it is
really really cute it's like a really
really form-fitted suit like like dress
or whatever have like this pocket patch
in here right here but it's really cute
and like you could have like the UM my
eyes like we call those things like the
shoulder pad shoulder pad and it's like
a nice material on the breast parts you
have to wear a bra you could just your
baby's up I thought that this looks
fabulous
it does get a lot very very cheeky guys
so I was just said be careful with this
when you're going to be very cheeky in
this this is not something else I don't
even think I will wear I would actually
have to convert the bottom pieces I
would have to actually wear bottom of my
own bottom pieces underneath it I can
own like my own Spanx on it because the
bottom part rolls up my ass like a thong
so it's just kind of left oh my god but
this is really cute and you can like
with straight hair back stitch like it
was just everything I wish I felt it
like that felt this one a lot like I
felt it like this was really really hot
like so I just like this it is too hot
outside
well it's see-through so it might not be
too hot out there but if there's a
different of that and I find like a
bottom like a sub Spanx that are full
coverage Spanx for my ass cheek saying
jiggle all over the place are definitely
worth it because it's definitely
definitely really cute guys so yes this
is definitely one of my favorites as
well from she inside alright so the last
place I got stuff from was rock romley
calm now I got a couple t-shirts I
really like their t-shirts from these
Asian based websites they're really cute
and they have like these funny things
you're like really cool things you can't
really find that many t-shirts at down
the US which is weird but they do
provide a lot of those cool screen tees
so the first shirt I got is it's really
cute shirt now this turns like a
coca-cola inspired shirt and this shirt
is red and it says chocolate on it now
obviously doctors because I'm a
chocolate girl so I thought it was
really cute and it's a really cute
screen tea
it wasn't expensive on the website now
the material is kind of like a polyester
material so instead of me wearing it
like hanging down and kind of like tied
it up because the material is too silky
like soft it's not too much of a cotton
style shirt so you can definitely wrap
this up and make it look cute now it is
really nice guys I think that it's cute
and for all my chocolate girls out
they're represent this is definitely a
cute shirt to get now the next check
then again is another screen t and this
one says Bonjour bitches I thought this
was really badass I know that sounds
corny but it was just like really in my
face when I saw it so I picked it out
it's black and it has red and white red
and white like writing text on it I
guess and it says Bonjour bitches and I
just thought that was so cute it's dope
and it's like it's in your face I don't
know something about it was really cute
now this is cotton style shirt so
therefore you can wear this just regular
with jeans you don't have to try too
tight you can tie it up but it's not
it's more of a constructed type shirt so
therefore you can wear this with jeans
and be relaxed or whatever I thought it
was really cute guys and the the detail
on the neckline too was cute it's more
of like a sporty detail so that really
sold me too I know these little details
are weird but I look into stuff like
that a lot now the next thing I got was
this cute tie-dye dress and I don't know
if it's a dress or a short but maybe for
me it'd be a shirt which I would have to
wear like Spanx with or like leggings
because that's just something that I
have to deal with in my life but it's
okay so this one is cute and it's like
really tight I use like pink blue and
like yellow and it has like this huge
smiley face on it I thought this was
really cute
it's just something just to wear like I
just like stuff I felt like I loved
tie-dye I loved like all those mixed
rainbow colors it just is just my thing
I don't know I just that's something
that I like matches because I represent
LGBT or whatever but it's just because I
really like that mix of colors I just it
just makes me happy so I definitely love
my ties and I have a whole bunch of time
action at my house so I definitely like
this and the smiley face just was so
cute too so I picked this one out and I
promise is wear this with sneakers and
like I said I have to wear Spanx on
anything and that's it it's just
something simple to wear and I just
thought it was cute now the next thing I
got is this really cute dress now this
dress I liked it but it's too short I
feel like all this add has become too
short for me because like you have to
like when you're putting clothes on you
got it understand the structure and the
shape of things you know I'm saying I'm
thinking about when I put it on it's
just going to like flex the back and not
it has to go over something to like land
in the perfect position and I never
think about that like
when it comes to me trying on clothes
you're buying clothes never think about
my leg my asset so that's the issue that
I have I'm always thing like oh it's
going to be okay it's going to fit bitch
no so this one fit however it's too
short so I probably have to give this to
my sister it's a really cute us what do
you call it skater dress it is this nice
gray color and I love gray colors just
for the summer I do like the high neck
right here and kind of the open shoulder
tank top version it's really cute I
would definitely wear this to sneakers
and stuff like that a jean jacket but
it's too short so I would have to end up
wearing Spanx with it or kind of like
shorts or whatever to kind of make it
look good but it's definitely one of
those inexpensive pieces kind of like
regular basic pieces that you style up
so that's why I picked this one out
because they just thought it was really
really point point I just thought it was
on point now the last two things that
are dresses now I'm going to wear stuff
like this well not too too much like I'm
just like I'm just kind of like one of
those like boring addresses and dresses
out I don't know just I'm not really too
frou-frou and pretty pretty like kind of
stuff like that like too frou-frou and
stuff like that so this is definitely
different for me on these two items so I
picked this one up versus because I like
this style now this one is kind of like
the off-the-shoulder look and I showed
you guys a dress that I got from fashion
overdose similar to this but the one for
fashion OVA is a bit more you know
fashion or sexy type but this is
cute the only thing about this one it is
a size large I believe anything that's
the size large and I feel like I wish I
should have got I wish I would have got
a size a medium it's a little bit big in
the book like this doesn't even say up
on your boobs the material is weird but
it's a really cute dress it took a lot
of time and detail into this dress like
putting like like these little designs
into I just thought it was really cute
but it just does not fit the way that I
would like it to fit I felt like it
should have been a little bit more
tighter on the on the chest area and
then bit looser out but the looseness
that's out on it's just weird
but if I'm going to if I'm going to
someone's wedding or like doing like
something like really like you know like
a tea party of a tea party um shut the
 up
a bridal shower baby shower I'd wear
this I'm not gonna lie I worked a bridal
shower baby shower so it has a purpose
guys it has
purpose now the last chest that I got is
another dress that you guys probably
won't really not see me wear that much
because it's just it's like different
for me I'm like a cinema but this is the
direct last shot it's really pretty it's
a blue dress and it's kind of like a
chiffon II dress it's like really really
like like flowy and nice it does have a
little crisscross design on it on the
front the breast part and I just thought
was really nice the royal blue color
really complements me and I know you
guys are going to mention that I did get
tanned like crazy so you'll see Tan
marks everywhere in my chest have those
little fake tattoos on and like the Sun
roasted me outside in Mexico so I just
kind of figure out how to match my
makeup with my new skin because I had
darker makeup so like I like
I worked so hard to get this to work
today so incredibly I got burned I like
I got sunburned all over the place but
yeah so this is cute guys and I really
like it it's flowy and like I said this
is something I were to like a bridal
shower or ever worked with like a baby
shower or something just there is
something very flowy cute where some
sandals with some baby heels with it and
just go off with it
so that's everything guys for this Tron
haul I hope you guys enjoyed this one
obviously there were some banger pieces
up in this bitch and there were some
pieces that were like okay but like I
said everything you can work it out and
figure out how to make this look good
and I usually do that one so I always
try to find a way to incorporate into my
fashion in my looks so yeah so don't
forget guys to thumbs up this video
