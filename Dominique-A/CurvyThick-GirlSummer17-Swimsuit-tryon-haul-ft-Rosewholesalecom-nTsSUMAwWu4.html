curvy plastic girl try and haul now in

swimsuits from rose wholesale calm now I
think they're like a sister company to
zap all calm and I've worked with them
before so some of the items are kind of
similar in style and taste so you get

you're interested in seeing what I have
today I would like you to stay tuned and
keep online so what I'm going to start
off today is with the cover ups just
because the cover ups are really
important lately we have been using
cover ups just because I haven't been
feeling like my best self I am trying to
do this weight loss or anything so I'm
trying to get back down to like 10 I get
down 10 pounds just so I can feel really
comfortable comfortable but that's
another video for you guys that's
interested in the weight loss video just
leave your comments down below so I'm
going to say that the cover ups first
and I got two black cover ups and one
white cover up now the first one I got
is really cute it's just like a
spaghetti strap crochet type of cover-up
this is something that you would wear
like with a bikini very cute I have like
the fringe on the bottom which I really
liked which is why I picked it out I
don't even know what size this is I
think it was like one size fits all and
I assumed that when I picked it up that
it was going to sit but a distant it
looks cute you can wear one like a one
piece bikini whatever you want and just
something cute to put over just to kind
of conceal a little bit of whatever you
have just so you're not to expose the
second one I got is a see-through one I
actually lost the string in the dryer I
don't even know how I lost the string it
does have a waist belt string on it but
dumb of course that one up so let's
see through and it does have a like a
little bit of that fringe or tassel at
the ends of the bottom it's really cute
it does have like these nice it's kind
of like a nice fishnet kind of like a
hex like a floral pattern to it I don't
know if you guys can see that it's
really pretty and lightweight and it's
short sleeve so definitely looks good on
it's just something to cover up as like
I said before if you're going somewhere
with his kids around you got like one of
those dogs bikinis on or something like
that
you don't want to be overexposed in
front of people this is perfect just to
cover yourself up just a little bit
around a crowd this is the white one
that I had from this company as well now
this white one is a bit different the
reason why I like this one a live kind
of an off-white color and it has like
these really cute tassels on the back of
the top of the kind of like a nice
colorful tassel design it is like a
crochet it does have like a crochet
outline around the arm collar and the
back area so I thought that this was
really cute it is a bit cheeky so you
will get like a little bit of a
explosion with the cheeks but I just
thought it was a really nice really
simple classic white color and it just
looks really good on the body so it kind
of accentuates your areas with a good so
I definitely wanted to get this one most
okay so I'm going to show you this two
one-piece bathing suits that kind of
look similar but they are not so me
showing you one after another what kind
of wreck will kind of show you guys that
they're not the same now the first I'm
going to show you is this really cute
blue pink and white one and it has
jellyfish on it now I really like this
one a lot guys because it looks it looks
first of all they put the cuts on this
one perfect it is actually crisscross
all the way down to the side so you have
a lot a lot of skin exposure it's really
cheeky but it's cheeky to the point
where it's sexy cheeky and not too
 cheeky and I know because
I do but this is really cute it
just cuts really nice and in the back
this print is good too you're not really
rolling up in the back it does have a
little bit breast pads in the boot part
and it does kind of cover the hard nips
up and it does give you like a little
bit of a push
nothing crazy but it does fit very nice
this is actually one of my favorite
businesses in this website I just love a
good one-piece bathing so you can like
it's really hard finding one that's
going to fit right and this one fits
perfect now the second one it got is
also a really nice one too guys this one
is different the cuts on this one are
actually in the back and they are
actually a lot in the front now I was a
little worried about this one because it
like a scottex for my family it's got to
be too fatty and like I was ready to
dispose but I just sucked it up and I
was like to myself you know what I'm
just going to try it on anyway so it's
not a big deal so
this one is actually it looks similar to
the last one but it's really not this
one's a little bit more royal blueish
purple color now the cups in the front
are coming the front right here it is
very exposed in the front sir president
roll-up too much but I was so nervous
it does have cuts in the back as well
which are really cute it's like a cage
look it does have a padding in the
breast part if you're not a big fan of
that you can just take those out and
just say it I'll just keep mines in
did you hide I really feel like hard
nips a lot so it does kind of conceal
your hard nipples which I really
appreciate so I'm going to keep mines in
and both of these do have adjustable
straps they can just adjust it if it's
too civets too tight or too loose so I
just I just sort of think that these two
were like one of the best ones I do
prefer the one before better just
because it just looks really good I look
really great so the next time soon I
want to show you guys is it's really
cute yellow one-piece now these are
really cute these ones that are trending
that say that have kind of like stains
on it
this one says drug spice and I really
like this one it's like a really really
tough material and it really does suck
you up really nicely which I like I
think I got to send an extra large
if you want to deficit size down for a
little bit extra and I feel like I could
have size down to larger got it to be a
little bit more tighter and suck me and
nice but I think this is really cute
it's one of those fun bathing suits
should just wear to the beach with your
girl just really simple and I thought it
was really nice now the second one will
not decide on the next one that I got is
it's actually a three piece but first I
don't literally like the bikini actual
bikini top part just because it's kind
of funny and it has like a weird padding
in it that just just doesn't look right
so I just opted not to wear but I will
show you guys anyways what it looks like
so this one is a two-piece and it has
like this high-waisted bottom now the
time with the bottom has cuts on the
side and with me when I get cuts on the
side like that or gap you like this your
large I usually have like a very large
fat pocket that comes out but I don't
care so I do have a fat pocket that
comes out with these one but it's still
nice I like how sporty and athletic it
looks all together now the top is
hysterical because the topics we'll just
say running through the six with my woes
but
oh yeah it just set something completely
different and I'm not I'm probably dumb
as hell for picking it out thinking that
was saying the right one right thing but
it was cute and I didn't look at the
writing when I saw I just thought it was
like really cute so that I'm going to
get this anyways so this is what the top
looks like it's black and it has the
same pattern sleeves at the bottom and
obviously they that writing up
miserably but I guess I'd be copyright
if they had it the right way anyways but
it's really cute I love this sporty
athletic surfer look it has it does come
with a bikini top like I said but I
opted not to wear the bikini side
because I don't like it I think just the
bottom of the top to go perfectly
together you could just get away with
that one and it just looks so cute and
fun it's not you're not trying to be
sexy or any crazy thing it just looks
really good and I really really really
like this bathing suit guys it's like
one of my faves as well I think like
everything was my thing so the last two
swimsuits that I got are kind of similar
similar and style I guess I didn't
realize this when I picked them up they
are different colors and slightly
different in style so please bear with
me so the first one that I got is this
really cute fun floral design one now
the thing that makes these both similar
is that they both have this mesh padding
in the breast area said device which
kind of gives you like a little bit of
sex appeal which I really like because
it really makes your breasts look nice
this one has kind of like a low-cut back
it is very very nice you can adjust the
straps on this one and it is a size
large and it fits very well I was
surprised I thought I actually thought I
got XL but I got a large and it fits
perfect this is one of my favorites as
well I was kind of going for more of a
cultural trend this time because I'm
going to Jamaica for seven days and I
need to look I need to be colorful at
needs to be bright I need to be tie-dye
so that's what I was going for when I
got these ladings is obviously the trend
is very bright and fun now the second
one we got is a black one the black one
to me I thought it was cute it's it the
breast really nice that doesn't really
made the breast nice it has said about
the lower cut than the other one and it
has a much panel on the top in the front
here and basically now that I look at it
it basically practically the same style
same look this is just black I don't
like the black material the materials
kind of funny and it kind of makes you
lumpy all over it definitely gave my
pooch
like a bigger appearance which was kind
of like annoying this but I do like
the red black and blue pattern and color
together so that's what definitely Jew
me to this one and I thought that this
was cute and yeah so that's basically it
