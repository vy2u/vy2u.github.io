with another heavy plastic girl China
now in today's video this video is going
to be strictly shapewear now you guys
asked me so much to show you guys the
shapewear that I use when I'm trying my
clothes on a shapewear that I wear in
general so I decided to come today and
give you guys that video I will show you
guys some exercise garments as well as
some workout trainers that I use as well
too sometimes I always try and do it
throughout the day if I'm working like
an eight-hour shift or 12-hour shift so
I will show you guys that as well as
some garments that I wear if I'm wearing
dresses etc etc so I will leave sound
everything down below for you guys if
you guys are interested do not forget to
thumbs up this video leave your comments
down below subscribe and share and if
you're interested in seeing what I have
to offer today I would like you to stay
tuned and keep on watching guys so the
first things I'm going to show you guys
are from a company called killer curves
calm now they send me two garments just
to try and I absolutely love these
garments now I was skeptical in the
beginning because I had so much trouble
shopping from a website called body fat
I will show you one thing from body fat
that I actually like to actually work
but I had trouble in the past shopping
from them just because like their
garments and waist trainers they kind of
give you a lot of back fat and like I
usually ask them for long torso cuz I
have a longer torso so but they usually
send me these freakin short ass court
says garment waist trim is whatever and
I always have like an extra-large back
fat now they sent me this one and this
one I don't get back fat in which I like
it's really undetectable just because of
the boning now they did a really good
job on this one and it's black obviously
they did carry this one in to cause
they're cute in the tan color and black
but obviously I'm going to pick black
hello
now this is really good because it does
come with three class up here so if
you're trying to start off and you're
trying to get it on number one which is
the hardest part just because it is a
little bit tight so you can kind of
transition like as you're training or
you kind of slimming down you go from
the first lash to the second lashes
third latch I think I'm on the first lap
your second left I'm not sure yet it
does have a zip at the bottom so you
just zip it up and close it it is latex
material so there
sturdy it's very very sturdy and it
doesn't have that boning that was going
to pop out I hate that boning
that ends up popping out and you kind of
have like jabbing in the back I can't
stand that and body sab offers those
expresses it like really leather leather
one another the things that this is like
kind of that leather latex I don't know
what material this is I always it down
below for you guys but it's like really
good material now I got this in a size
large and when you're shopping on this
website make sure that you pick the
items on your t-shirt or shirt size I
wear size medium large but I also going
to take any risk of the medium sorry
opted for the large and I'm very happy
if it's very nice it's undetectable it
looks smooth and just absolutely popping
the next thing that they sent me is its
workout that
now this workout this was something I
was interested in just because I'm
trying to work out I'm trying to loose
weight now this one is a zipper best at
the top and it has a velcro belting at
the bottom so basically you put yourself
in this and you just velcro yourself in
it so um and the hole means of hole
purposes of this to kind of help you
sweat out work out you lose inches off
of your waist so I would recommend
really getting in and tightening the
waist the but the blue parts a little
bit tight though so if you're very busty
I would deficits eyes up I got this in a
size large so if you have like double D
breasts or large D breasts I would say
get a size extra large this works really
good and this is something that honestly
and truly would wear with leggings
outside because you can wear this and
make it look like it's kind of part of
an athletic outfit no one would honestly
know that this is not this that this is
a garment I'd wear leggings with it and
just walk out the house just like that
you definitely get away with that if
you're trying to do like a whole day
sweating process type of situation so
this is definitely something that I
would consider wearing or if you're into
working on you want to lose weight and
you're trying to live that healthy
lifestyle this can be something that can
help you because it does help you lose
inches off your waist by the sweating
process so definitely look into this one
and I'm happy that I got so the one
thing that I got from body fab which was
a while ago
it's ass waist trainer and I got some
type of liquid on Ellen what the hell
still on the ship but I'm going to show
you guys it anyways so this is supposed
to be a workout trainer and I got it in
the color blue
so now body stop is different they go by
inches so you definitely have to measure
yourself before you purchase stuff in
them so I got this in the size 34 which
is about a size medium to large I
definitely need to size up and kind of
transition my way down just because I'm
still on the first class I don't know
I'm just I need to get back to my old
program of doing things because I suck
now now this one comes with two this one
comes with two hooks so usually I go for
the ones with the three hooks but this
one has two hooks on it this is a short
torso and I was really obsessed that
when I got this because I am NOT a short
torso I have a long torso so therefore I
do get that back fat in the back so I'm
trying to wean off of this one right
here and trying to wear the black one
from killer curves just because that one
is a full-coverage one where you don't
get that back fat hanging out this one
is way too short on the torso end so
therefore it will give you that
excellent hamburger meat back fat so I'm
definitely I wear this like I would
definitely wear this just like I'm going
to the gym and stuff like that but like
I said if you're working on your try to
cinch your waist in you're going to have
a lot of back fat and you're going to
kind of divide yourself into like a back
fat section which I've done to myself so
I'm trying to slim down the proper way
by wearing a garment that fully covers
myself so therefore I can swim that guy
so the next things I'm going to show you
guys are these two little shaper pieces
that I got from Walmart now these are
part of the Cupid brand and I think
Walmart provides always a cupid branding
garment now I got this one in a size I
believe this is the size of larger
medium I'm not sure we're going to go
with the medium so this is in the size
medium and it's black now this is a kind
of like up underneath the book boobs
shapewear so it goes pretty high so if
you're wearing like a pencil skirt or
stuff like that or jeans you definitely
don't have to worry about it showing
you're fully covered and fully just done
now this is what it looks like now it is
all black and it does kind of have like
the seamless padding spot in the back so
this you see right here is like it's a
seamless padding area now if you wear
this with like a skirt anything you will
not see any panty line at all you will
not see anything you're completely
covered it does have like a little
boning in the back right here
which kind of gives you some upper back
support and it also has a little boning
at the on the top on the sides right
here so you don't have to worry about
this rolling down on you it will stay up
firm and be very supportive it does give
you a nice firm extra firm hold which I
like and this will guide this honestly
and truly was only ten dollars and ten
dollars you cannot be ten dollars off an
item like this it does what you needed
to do full coverage you're totally
covered and it looks great so I
definitely pick these up at war as much
as I can
once I wear them out I kind of go back
and buy a new one buy new and buy a new
one they just work really good and
they're inexpensive versus going and
buying like some twenty thirty dollars
cheaper this is only ten dollars shaper
that I got is this black one now this
one I think is in a size large and it's
black now this is very simple as on now
this one is not like the extra tough
hold like the first one this one has a
very light holes but it carries you on
carries you on and kit picks you up and
carries you where you need to go so
that's one thing I like even if you
don't if you don't want like a really
firm control like I wear something like
this on if I'm having my menstrual just
because I won't feel like it helps you
know kind of hold your stomach and
especially when you're bloated so it
definitely gives you that type of
support a bloated support it's a very
simple black one guys it is a silky
texture it is really cute it's very
simple this is a size logic I said it
has like a really medium control on it
so you're not getting like a full
control but it does the job like I said
and it's just something that I wear just
because it really helps if you're like
if you have like a menstrual blow or
you're just feeling kind of stuff it'll
kind of help kind of flatten you out
just a little bit but not give you that
extra from controller to other one and
this was about six dollars so it
definitely was something that I picked
up at Walmart it was like it's something
I could wear when I'm feeling bloated or
I'm feeling you don't next alright guys
so that basically wraps up this video I
hope you guys found this video very
informative and now you guys are no
