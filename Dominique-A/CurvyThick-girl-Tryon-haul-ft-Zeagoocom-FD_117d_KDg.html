today with another curvy girl trying huh
so in today's video I will be featuring
some products from a company called
Eagle comm and I've seen a thousand
reviews on YouTube from other people who
have reviewed products in them as well
so of course I jumped on the bandwagon
so some of the products I'm going to
show you guys are terrific there are
some a few things that I noticed but for
the most part I'm very pleased with the
products that I was said and I hope that
you guys enjoy it don't forget to thumbs
up this video subscribe and leave your
comments down below and I want you guys
to stay tuned and keep on watching okay
so the first piece are going to set up
is kind of like one of those jumpsuit
pieces now this is more towards athletic
type of jumpsuit piece this is a size
large guys and I will link everything
down below directly from the pieces that
I got I got this one in an army green
color and it's basically like a long
sleeve and long pants the bottom of the
pants legs have that kind of like tight
stretchy part at the bottom kind of
giving that like tight substance at the
bottom of your legs and it also does
have switched up the knee cap I really
like this outfit guys I think that this
looks really good on it's like it fits
your body really nicely and that army
green color goes perfect for the season
so for this one I probably wear this
when we heal it does have kind of like
the elastic band waist so you can kind
of make it smaller and tighter to kind
of accentuate your waist a little bit
which I really liked when I tried it on
because it kind of get it kind of sucks
you in and make you look really good I
did have to spank something with this
one so therefore it will kind of like
mould you out really well so I do
absolutely love this outfit I probably
wear this this weekend when I go to a
concert with heels so I just think it's
just something simply so more like a
sporty outfit that you can jazz up and
make it look really feminine so that's
really one thing I really like about
this off and it's probably my favorite
one so far the next item I have I'm like
sticking with a green trend because I
just love greens especially for the
season so this one right here is kind of
like this green kind of like split
dressing it's actually not a dress guys
but I wore it when the try on obviously
the DLC I tried on a dress it does have
a massive split in the middle of it so
there's no buttons or
in there so if you kind of let slip your
legs over you're going to get a lot of
couch like a lot of coochie so I would
be careful with this one arm which is
just where like kind of like those biker
shorts spandex biker shorts that you get
from for every 20 for like $3 and those
will actually help like diminish kind of
the exposure a little bit so I
definitely want consider getting some
Spanx to things or you can wear leggings
but mostly what I would do with this one
is work when I go to Mexico is just a
cover-up when I go to the beach of my
bathing suit or if I want to be daring I
will wear Spanx with it and maybe like a
tube top underneath it just to wear it
out but it's really cute with short
sleeves it does have a belt that is
attached to it and it has pockets in the
front and it has it gives you a really
nice silhouette which I like so it makes
you look really nice and form-fitted and
nice a pretty color and it's a nice
satin material so therefore it's not
heavy at all so I really really like
this as well too guys so the next day
I'm going to show you guys is just like
one piece is just very simple and I
picked this one out just because I was
kind of like oh I love I love simple
activewear so let me just pick something
I could just throw on Express you like
it's kind of cold still it's kind of
getting a little bit like one the warmer
sound like in the 6065 lately so this is
basically like a sweater expect kind of
like one of those like girls t-shirt
hoodies pal hoodies or whatever if I'm
saying that right I'm gonna phone saying
that right away
so it's just like a really basic top
guys it's like a gray it's like white in
the middle and it has like a gray
outline on the hood in the arms I just
thought that this was cute like I said I
wear sneakers and stuff like that and
jeans like that sometimes I like to keep
it really simple so this would be really
simple with jeans and sneakers I just
think it's like a really basic product
really cute and comfortable and
especially when the changing of weather
like it's going from winter winter to
spring so this would be just something
good just to put on with a leather
jacket or something very basic people so
I definitely just up because I just like
the color great white that was in it I
hope dorky horny right so the next item
that I got is really kind of fancy so
this is a dress now all the other items
I just showed you guys are all size
large as well now this dress is a size
extra large this chest I got it XL
because I wasn't sure how
Bini like may the product sometimes you
get products are too too tight
expression asian asian based companies
they're usually a little bit too tight
so i wanted to be careful with this one
so i picked this one out and extra large
and it's basically like a wrap dress it
is too big so what I have to do when I
try this on was trying to wrap it twice
around and I ended up tying it on the
wrong side because it was too big but I
thought it just is very nice it's a very
sexy red color and I actually wore with
this wig on but I had like straight in
the middle part I think it looks really
really sexy like that I do wish there
was a lot of material in the front on
the bottom here if my tear asunder by
was a little bit shorter if I can get it
like kind of fixed to be a little bit
shorter it would actually be like a
little bit more hotter
I know shorter and hotter well done but
so I just kind of feel like this little
bit looks a little much material but
it's a really really nice dress a wrap
dresses go perfect for curvy girls and
girls of the body so that's one of my
favorite things to wear wrap dresses
just accentuates your curves even more
and in this dress you're a killer in it
like this is a killer dress guide so I
definitely recommend if you're curvy and
you've got that bottom piece and you got
that little top feed that this will look
really good with some hips and
everything so I definitely recommend
this dress for anyone who is on the
Kirby Kirby Kirby side because this
definitely will flatter anyone who's
very very accentuated look like who
wants accentuate yeah so the next thing
I got was a toga
the next thing I got and I'm always
picking shit up off the floor I don't
know like I'm always never prepared of
these things in my lap but that's the
purpose you know filming right so the
next thing I got was kind of this is
kind of like one of those it's the items
for me I just think that this this piece
just gave me too much crotch like I
kinda feel like I had like the large
camel tone on this and I'm being
completely on it completely blunt with
you guys I just felt like I had like a
really huge crotch in this like a long
crotch so this is basically like a
two-piece set and it's also comes with
the kind of like exposed kneecaps like
the first outfit that I showed you guys
the only difference is the bottom of the
pants aren't tight they're kind of loose
so whatever I would do is - that one's
kind of sew it in seconded up a little
bit cuz I hate like flappy ankles it's
just fucking weird
so it does come as elastic band on
elastic waistband and it doesn't have
pockets
bummer no pockets in the front which I
think that's why my camel toe looks like
my vagina looks like so large in it
because it doesn't have pockets which is
like why would you put pockets in
something like that like come on so it's
just like this is very simple and this
is an aside a large guys and it also
came with like the the crop top as well
but they have like a small hoody on the
top of the crop top very simple if you
have large large boobs I don't recommend
getting this in a size large because
there's no way like the shit was almost
lifting on me a little bit and what I
mean like I was saying maybe not wear a
bra with them and just wear like a band
deal with it maybe because I had a bra
on and like my boobs are happy as hell
with I wear a bra but I wouldn't
recommend wearing this with like a bra
maybe just like a t-shirt bra or like a
sports you know what sports for our
people sports bra but this was very cute
guys and it I thought it was cute
together expenses the body really nicely
and it cuts perfect the problem is it
kind of gives your your woman part your
triangle a funny look like it kind of
looked like I had like a sasquatch purse
or whatever just it just didn't look
that great but like I said you could
just kind of wear maybe like I
definitely I recommend wearing there
with no panties I know girls out there
do that I recommend wearing was some
nice you know song shorts and board
shorts and the mine's like something
that's really nice that's not going to
give too much exposure because the first
thing to remember to do is look straight
to your crotch when they see you so be
careful with that one but like I said
accentuates pretty good makes you look
like a low you know low badi and I think
it's cute so last night last but not
least is the super duper cute cold
shoulder top now this is like at
response style shirt guys and it has the
cold shoulders I thought this was really
cute especially when you're just trying
to go on like a regular brunch or dinner
day or whatever it's just like something
simple that you can wear with jeans and
slacks you don't got to get all crazy
get all sexy and fantasy I think the
clothes shoulders kind of give away a
little bit of sexiness to and appeal so
I really thought that this is cute and
this is also size large guys and I
thought that this was just a good piece
just to put on just a style up with like
any regular outfit so I picked that one
out too so that's basically it for this
try on haul and what
minimal items but I think that like the
items look good like usually with some
of these companies you have to be kind
of wary when you get the promises you
don't know how they're going to fit for
the most part multiple products to fit
me very nicely I think the size of
two-piece which is kind of funny but
like I said if I'm being risque one day
and I just want to wear it uh probably
wear it and yeah
so that basically wraps up the video
guys I hope you guys enjoyed this video

say also subscribe and leave your
