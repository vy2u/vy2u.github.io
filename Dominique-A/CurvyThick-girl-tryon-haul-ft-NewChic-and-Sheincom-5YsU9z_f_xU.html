today with another curly flash big girl
trying haul video now in today's video
I'll be showing you guys I Tamar mushi
kimchi and side Calm now if you're
interested in any of these products from
today everything will be linked down
below now if you're interested in seeing
what has to offer in today's video I
would like you to stay tuned and keep
alright guys so I'm going to kind of
jump right into the video so it is going
to be different today because I'm not
used to not trying on clothes with
different hairstyles I don't know if I'm
like the weirdest person that does that
but I kind of feel like when I do the
chai and haw I like to show you guys
like the way I would wear it if I was
like going on a day to day basis but I
do have my LOC extensions in now so I
can't really do that for you guys so
hope you guys enjoyed thus far and
thumbs up the video if you do like my
hair it's something different I think
it's actually pretty cool I'm actually
really liking it a lot I just try to
have my own twist reppin Haiti right
here and stuff like that so yeah so the
first thing I'm going to show you guys
is this when I first got this act this
is from new chic so when I first got
this I thought that this was a shirt but
then when I try to know that oh it's a
dress now for some reason I don't I
don't know if it's a material I really
like the material this item the material
is kind of like one of the tails that
hugs and conceals in a weird way so in
this one I don't look at lumpy and dumpy
and bumpy so and this one it actually
looks really good and it's kind of one
of those curved hem style dresses where
it has like a really nice curve at the
bottom which I like it kind of goes the
dress more body this is a size extra
large and I do like to army fatigue look
I probably just wear this just if I have
nothing to wear and just really like
slides within it just because it look
cute like that so I'm definitely I like
this one a lot and I wasn't expecting it
to be like this honestly in the next
video to show you guys it's really cute
tie-dye romper now when I put it up to
the camera kind of really washes me out
so you guys will see it when it comes up
in the clip basically it's like a really
cute like romper that's like a short set
it's very bright and it's a tie dye
color one thing I want to say about this
website is when they do tie-dye they do
tie-dye really good obviously some
manufactures tie i but it looks like
really good and perfect so I just I just
like it like a lot of stuffs I get a
stuff or items that I get that are tied
as you get it from these Asian based
websites because they're like perfectly
tie-dye now this is really cute it is
short but this is the type of thing I
would wear if I'm going to get breakfast
or if I'm just on the run and pretty put
like a long long line cardigan or like
little thin sweater over it just so that
it doesn't show my cheeks too much but I
thought that this was really cute and
inexpensive so I picked this one out now
the next thing I want to show you guys
is this little set that I got I usually
get these sets of lockers because I like
the material and how relaxed it is now
I'm probably going to wear this to the
airport just because it's very very
laid-back simple and cute and I could
wear with slides I might wear to the
airport I'm not sure you I just I don't
know why I keep formulating an airport
up in my head it's not that serious
but for me I need to know what I'm
wearing just because I could take it out
of my bag the luggage before I go if you
get what I'm saying so this is what it
looks like it's one of those off the
shoulder style on one Pete 1 jumpsuits
it's a long leg it's long legs it's
always done skinny ankles style pants
now I really like this a lot guys just
because number one it's black and number
two it looks really good and put
together and it's very in why am I
having a hard time taking this up it's
very nice and inexpensive now when I put
it on I kind of felt like it looks
really good and I will link down the
shapewear that I want is video I wore in
some outfits so don't worry I'll be
linked down to be the first link down
below because you guys ask me all the
time now I really like this a lot guys
just because it looks really good on the
body and it's kind of off the shoulder
and gives you like a little bit of sex
appeal which I like and it does have an
elastic waistband so you can tighten in
and make yourself look Snatcher more
snatch than usual and it is ankled so it
does have like a tight angled leg which
I like so you can definitely wear
sneakers slides or whatever and look
really cute with it it is a little bit
linty though so the thing about this one
is if you're like you will catch a lot
of lint specks on here which is annoying
so I'm going to have to be careful when
I wash this especially that I don't wash
it with a lot of white clothes or well I
want to do that anyways but I have to
watch how I wash it and not dry it
because I feel like when I dry some of
these items they shrink up so much and
I'm already big so it's kind of like I
can't have a shrink of too damn much so
I need to be careful when I'm
buying all these items as well but I
really do like this it's really
comfortable very very soft and like this
is a southern see that I think this is a
size extra-large or 2x I'm not sure let
me see so I wish you told me that but um
I'm going to go with size large guy so
this would be really well if you're big
if you're big like me or a little bit
heavier than me you could definitely get
away with an extra larger 2x so this was
definitely a good catch
now the next thing I got is it's really
cute black it's kind of like one of
those fashion Nova little jumpsuit
things but this one's different because
this one has no tank top it's a tube top
version and you just slide into an in it
stops at your ankles at your knee cap
which I really like
now this one I did wear my garment with
it just so I can be extra snatched and I
think it looks really good I was asked a
question someone loved the comment in my
last try and haul video and they asked
me this several times and I've addressed
it before
I've been asked if I had like a
Brazilian butt lift or something like
that no I told you that I think was a
Q&amp;amp;A that I told you guys you can't get
me on this one
didn't get one only thing I got was
breast implants you guys already know
that I was flat as a board before so you
guys know I got breast implants and they
look so natural now it's like crazy like
I'm happy with the results by the way
and yeah but um someone asked me about a
brazilian butt-lift no boo not over here
but if you know if you know me like you
grew up with me you know that I've
always even in my habits what I've
always had a big butt like and I felt
like once I started losing weight it
seems like all the weight would get like
the weight would push that off of
different sections and just go right to
my ass like my butt's I was in big like
I feel like every time I lose weight or
formulate some type of weight loss my
butt just gets bigger it's kind of weird
I don't know but no I didn't have a
Brazilian butt lift people many ways
back to the outfit so this is what the
it looks like it's just regular black
you just jump into it and it's real cute
real simple this can also be airport
outfit too just because it's really easy
to put on number one you can wear with
sneakers flags whatever and just throw
like a nice cardigan sweater over it
just to keep it kind of cool I'm warm
and that's that I really like it a lot
I'm not a bra wear with stuff like this
I would just
women you know just boom done but if you
need to wear a bra you can wear a bra
with or whatever it is but it's pretty
it covers pretty well so I think this
was a good catch - I like this a lot
this is one of my favorites
now the next thing I got let's see let's
see the next thing I got I got it last
time I showed you guys this from a hall
from any club where it was in and this
was from any club where not previously
showed it before I'm not going to I'm
not going to do it again to the document
what I'm trying to do on the tents of
circuses again off of our new sheet with
the see what the smell is differences
one now when I try it on for the club
where I pack my pattern and I said sure
the McCanns different wasn't a mess but
when I try to weigh hi now I got this
one and it is short my legs my thighs
like eat up the shorts part and but the
thing about it is like the arms are
stretchy the boob area is nice and
stretchy you're not like suffocating
your titties and like your arms you can
do like like punches high ups and stuff
like that you don't have to be like you
know you're not constricted in this so I
was kind of like how is that possible
because this is a size extra-large and
the other ones a size extra large so I'm
like why why does that why's that with
tight and why is this one loose but I
realized that this material this this
the material used to make this is
actually stretchy material
the other one is more like a firm
material which is weird as well because
it's the same exact pattern but I like
this one although my thighs are really
really large and like I was eating up
the shorts I still wear this when I go
to Jamaica less I don't see nothing
wrong with it like it's a quick outfit
to wear it's good and I know it's going
to be hot so I'm trying to prepare
myself so that it's not like I'm not
sweating and done hence why do now I'm
not wearing away during exam because
this is not going to work so I hope that
this hope it works out now the next
thing I got is a seat what am I not
able to find out I'm oh here's the next
thing I got now this next thing that I
got I wasn't too much of a fan of this
when I first saw I was like this is what
I saw on the website
I thought the material is completely
different
that's number one I thought the material
is going to be completely different
completely this is noble but I still
tried it on it's still a decent I
accidentally lost a strange fur which is
kind of where topping the pile of
garbage on the floor mmm what is so this
is what it looks like it's kind of like
a weird polyester material which I
should have read the material closely on
this one I don't know why I didn't do
that that was like weird and I never do
that I always be the material so this is
what it looks like it's kind of like a
it's like a weird polyester material
it's like a blue color and it has a
distant gigantic lying spacer so oh is
that a tiger line the type tiger Wow
I'm losing it and it does have like the
little crisscross breast part but I lost
the string but I actually didn't think
it looked that bad without it to be
honest with you but is this something
that I really like no Isaac it wasn't
what I thought you know I wish it was a
different material which it was like
cotton material or you know something
different this materials is fact that
like I don't know it's just really weird
but I try to offer you guys this is size
extra large if you're into like this
type of style and I don't even like
animal print like faces like that on I
don't know why I picked that one a kind
of strange but I try not anyways to show
you guys if you guys are interested in
stuff like that but for me not really
dumb style but I want to give you guys
the option of seeing it anyways now the
next item that I got that is probably
one of my favorites very first while
embarrassing it's just cute little sassy
sexy piece nowadays I thought that disco
always picks up these see through things
like you know who does she think she is
okay but I like this one just because I
needed in a black outfit for on vacation
because there's like a theme party or
whatever that I guess you have to wear
black so I was like you know what I want
to wear something sexy you know I'm
going to be sexy so I picked this out
now this is really cute and when I got I
didn't anticipate it to be that cute
like the company sent me a few of the
links of the things that they had that
were new
and this came up and I'm like okay you
know I'll take that out no big deal
so when I got I was like wait really
like it's really really cute so this is
what it looks like guys now this one
it's it's basically they give you like
this long dress and it just has two
slits on the side right here it does
have like this cute little tassel and
shimmy shimmy Coco Puffs type of design
on it which is like really glaring like
you can walk into a room a be like boom
but I like that I'm not really that's
not my first choice of things that I
would get if I go shopping but I like
the whole theme I like the sex appeal
the sexiness and then you guys will
definitely see what I'm talking about
now it does have a low-cut cleavage I
don't know if your bra wear it doesn't
have padding in it doesn't have any of
that stuff so you got to let your
boobies just do what they need to do it
does have an adjustable bra strap area
on the strap right here so if you need
to kind of make it tighter or make it
move so you can do that with adjustment
or does have a nice detailed zip back up
here so you're nice and secure obviously
if you guys can see it feature on the
bottom there is no bottom but they do
give you a small pair of high-waisted
bottoms to wear with your dress now this
whole entire just a size extra large and
I got myself an extra large briefs that
fit perfect and that it just looks
really good I'm definitely going to wear
this when I go away something about this
and it has like I said it has two large
what I mean large splits two large
splits ever each always the top of the
dress part like right near like come on
girls like you know so you definitely
see a picture post on this oh come on
make sure you know harden like it so I
definitely like this tool I think it's
really sexy and you know it's okay to be
sexy when you want to be sexy so I just
thought you know I'm going to get this
because I like it and I don't care so I
got this one and I'm really happy with
another next two items I got are pretty
cute and I actually like these too and
kind of it away now this one I'm going
to show you guys is another mustard
style of romper I've been obsessed with
yellow you guys know I've just been like
on this yellow bin to just I don't know
something about it has really been
giving me this like crazy fancy so I've
just been really buying it like crazy
now this one is kind of like a
the cool print and kind of a lot of
colors I blue red white well that was
just about it blue red white patterns in
it
I just think it's really cute does house
like this pleated kind of like cascade
look at the top you can do a little
shimmy in now the only thing that's
worried about this it has like a long
crotch which is kind of weird like where
it should end that it doesn't end
correctly and then the pants the pit the
pants legs itself are high water so I'm
not sure if this is supposed to be kind
of like those above the ankle to style
pants but it just is kind of weird I
really want to like it because of the
color and the style but it doesn't fit
particularly the way I would like it to
so I probably end up giving this to my
sister because she's a bit thinner and
she's shorter than me now this is a size
extra large but I'm sure she could just
wear it like a oversized style on thing
but I think it's cute it just doesn't
fit the way the typical way that's how I
say it but it doesn't fit the typical
way that
yeah the typical way okay now the next
thing that I got that's really cute
isn't this jean dress now I have a lot
of heart I have a hard time buying Jean
Jax's or getting jean dresses from this
websites these Asian based websites just
because there's not a great amount of
stretch you don't know what type of
material are getting obviously it's not
gonna be 100% Jean and kind of mix your
materials together so I'm like really
wary of that but this one really said
the only problem with this one is it's
not a sturdy material so when I lift my
arms up the dress Rises which is kind of
weird I don't I don't see why that is
doing that I don't know if it's the way
they made a dress but it's really cute
so I am going to wear this but I'm going
to wear with black biker shorts
underneath the ones that kind of go just
above the knee cap so that it doesn't
I'm not looking too crazy on these
streets so I do like it it does have
that cute little sexy lace-up breast
area right here which I like I just like
the little detailing of a gold clasp on
the string and then the D to the Goldy
ton on the actual area where the string
goes through I just think this is really
cute the Jean material look is nice it's
one of those really nice kind of dark
wash jeans with yours that I like and it
looks really cute especially these
sandals that I tried on with them so I
was just kind of like wow I really
really like this so I'm definitely
definitely definitely going to keep
this one it is the size extra-large and
I think that's the highest side they
went up to this one if they had a 2x I
probably gotten the 2x to kind of expand
it out and be a little bit more free in
it and it has been it would have been a
little bit more forgiving but thus far I
really like this one as well
now the next and last thing I want to
show you I believe it's the last thing
hopefully I didn't forget anything but
if I did I just add in the end so I got
these little sandals now like I showed
this to my friend Alice and she was like
she was like oh they're cute I I don't
know I was just picking stuff out I can
I picked these out I don't know what I
mean I can pick them out cuz I had I
started my head like oh these are gonna
be billed guys I don't really know about
these shoes if I'm going to keep them
I'll probably give them to my mother
because my mother will really appreciate
this and she comes in and raised my
heart my place well she doesn't care
she'll take all my stuff and just be
gone with it so I really like these and
I'll probably give it I like them but
not for me I really like them for my mom
so I'll give them to my mom maybe she'll
wear them maybe she'll do something I'll
probably give it to granny granny would
like these see okay I already got an
idea now alright so the next place is a
well the next only place is she and
sicom so the first thing I'm going to
show you guys is this cute bodysuit now
this body's who drew my attention just
because it happened I had the word Queen
on it and when I tried it on it ended up
being one of those sides new types of
one pieces so if you have a larger
breasts or bigger like areolas make sure
you are very careful because you will
get a lot of to the exposure on the side
my boobs aren't the biggest ones but
they're pretty good from my body shape
my size I actually wish they were a
little bit bigger but that'd be in a few
years I'm not too worried about that now
I'm pretty good right now
but I thought this was really cute black
on black and everything I just thought
it was really bitchin so I picked this
out and it looks good and I might even
take it to Jamaica with me now the next
thing I got I got this in a size 3 XL
because I wasn't taking any chances now
this is supposed to be like a sweater
style like a sweater sweater dress to
have a hoodie has a strings on it and
it's kind of like high-low so the front
is short in the back is long I just like
this because this is one of those
transitional pieces I was talking about
so in the wintertime I mean going from
summer to fall like autumn you can try
to wear some like that when it gets a
little bit breezy the other day out here
in Connecticut it was like 70 degrees
but there's a little bit of a wind chill
so it's kind of like this is the type of
offer you could just wear on a day like
that with some sneakers or some slides
or whatever and just kind of make a cute
outfit so I would get stuff like this
just because it's something you could
wear like if you're a little bit chilly
or if you just want to have that real
relaxed look and I just love stuff like
this now the next thing I got is this
really cute dress now in the beginning
when I got this dress I wasn't - like
fond of it just because it has like
these really work slits in the front the
slits in the front are like they're not
that they're not like they're not
symmetric that's what I oh my god I
don't know whether it's just where I
want the pattern and I love I love this
spot because you are larger than the
largest one they have on your arms and
it's for the guns like this one I'm
going to slip in the front just to make
them a little bit longer and it does if
I cut to split up a little bit longer on
the top it'll kind of spread the dress
off the dress has a little bit of a
stomach brush area and then it looks
kind of weird just you'll see that a
tunnel out but I do like the concept and
style of dress is just was created funny
now the next thing I want to show you
guys this actually came at a two-piece
but I did not I did not like the
combination together and I'll probably
show you guys in a clip how the
combination looks I just did not like
the skirt with the top the top itself
though is is pretty poppin like it's
really sexy and it reminds me of the
wild thoughts video with Rihanna I don't
know something about it was really cute
and sexy so I definitely got my hands on
this the skirt was just too much the
material together was way too much
material way too much red and way too
much frou-frou I just it was just not me
so I just said to myself dump dump that
dangerous that damn skirt maybe I'll
give it to my sister she could wear with
the crops I don't know she'll figure it
out or I'll figure it out but I just
don't like it but the top askew is very
nice to have
three ways to tying it up you tie it up
at the top you tie it up in the middle
and you tie it up in the bottom you can
give yourself like a little bit of boob
exposure if you're just cutting you know
want to open it up a little bit like so
you know I'm saying if you want to do
that but I advise you not to be a little
bit respectful take care of yourself but
I really like the illness shoe item that
I got from she inside are these shoes
right here now these are like guys look
at this now I love those Birkenstock in
spoken stuff inspired shoes now this one
was the aqua blue that's kind of you
guys can see I don't have to describe it
like I really really like this what I
saw on the website so I picked them out
they are super comfortable super nice
and stylish so I definitely picked these
out and I had to choose these I had to
choose these yeah you guys I'm saying so
I really like these and I'll link these
down below make sure you guys check
their shoes shoe selection out because
they have amazing shoes and when they
come to you they actually come true to
size and they look exactly what they
look like on the website so definitely
check them out so I believe this is the
last item I have to show you guys I
don't see I'm stretching my bed ran out
I don't see anything else so I'm
assuming that this is the last item now
this was one of my favorites too now
this is one of those dress type of
situations where you have it's kind of
like a it gives you like the choker
style dress it's like an oversized
t-shirt dress that's what I mean it does
have like a nice cute little logo on the
front even know what it says it says
traveling engine and wings something
like that I just thought this was really
cute it's kind of like really trending
right now for these t-shirt dresses so I
picked this one up this one I believe is
a sighs let me see like a Sun that sign
this one here is a size grande large Wow
that I'm surprised the material for this
one is excellent it fits really well and
it looks really good on so I definitely
recommend picking this one off I
definitely were a biker shorts
underneath here just because when I move
