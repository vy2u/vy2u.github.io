today with another fashion video so
today's a little bit different because
I'm not shooting this video for a Friday
video if you did watch last Friday I did
not post a fashion Friday video up
simply because I had a huge computer
malfunction so I had to take my computer
back to max so that they can fix it the
computer crashed on me and I wasn't able
to use my apps the way I needed to to
edit my videos so I got that fixed
everything's back to normal so you guys
will get your regular scheduled videos
this week so that's a good thing so in
today's video I'm gonna show you guys
clothes from Plus and laughs shoes from
public desire and some jewelry from
soulful comm and I know you guys are
gonna ask me about my lip combination
because I've been noticing that you guys
have been asking me a lot about my lips
so I'm gonna show you guys the products
that I used for my lips so the first
thing that I use as a bottom base in my
lip is the Milani amore matte lip cream
and this is in the number 19 covet so
it's basically like a brown color that I
use all around my lips to give myself
kind of like that chocolate lip
I used to use limbal and they're brought
the same price but have it order from
color pops in a long time so I picked
this one up act actually Primark they
have actually a little section with
these items the next thing I use to play
in the center of my lips is a NYX soft
matte lip cream in the color London so
it's basically kind of like a nudie
color that I use in the inner part of my
lip just to kind of make my lips a
little bit more pouty and cute and then
I basically kind of outline my lips and
kind of bold my lips out with a wet wild
lip pencil or lip or eyebrow pencil
eyeliner and I use the dark brown color
so I use this all the time this about
dollar so each of the lipsticks range
from 6 bucks to 7 and then this lip
pencil is 93 cents so those are the
items that I use for my lips I know you
guys are gonna ask me so I just want to
say it out and straight and before this
video even starts and I know you guys
have recently been asking me about
makeup tutorials I'm gonna try to make
up to choice but I kind of feel like
when I shoot makeup tutorials they never
come out the way they look like when I'm
doing like my other videos so it's kind
of like weird so I'm probably just gonna
randomly shoot myself to make a video so
then I can you know see if it comes out
this way because makeup videos take a
while and you guys know I'm not a makeup
artist but I'm gonna try so that's
enough of the chitchat guys we're gonna
get straight into the video so if you're
interested in
I have to offer in today's video guys I
would like you to stay tuned to keep on
watching all right guys so what we're
gonna start off with first is some pants
that I got from plus and love so we're
gonna just start up a plus and love in
general just because they've got more of
their clothing items from them so the
first thing I'm going to show you guys
are some kind of like athletic leggings
now I really was into these leggings
because I seen them like on a lot of the
other Asian based websites so I wanted
to pick them out now plus and love
obviously with the name it's kind of
like a plus-sized website they do carry
smaller sizes so if you're like a small
medium large you def Akande find your
items there as well so the first thing I
got is a size extra large and they're
kind of like these polyester kind of
polyester mix cotton material leggings
the reason why I got these leggings was
for the design on the ankle so basically
it has like a crisscross opening area on
the side right here which I thought was
cute I see these trending a lot
everywhere so I wanted to try them out
these are really nice too bitch stretchy
I do feel like with these you'll get
like kind of like a long crotch I'm
really thigh heavy so therefore I kind
of like swallow into these types of
leggings so um I'm not too worried about
them not looking right if you do have
that kind of like a long cracker kind of
like a real big camel toe I would just
recommend wearing that kind of like a
t-shirt that's a little bit longer and
then putting a cardigan sweater or some
sneakers but they're just kind of like D
hyping it a little bit this the whole
point of this is to show off that pretty
cool design on the inca part so as long
as that part is being presented who
cares what the crotch part looks like
the butt part looks like as long it's
just covered up nice and the design is
accentuated that's all that matters so I
thought that these was really this was
really cute and it's actually priced
pretty well on the website
now the next pants I got are palazzo
pants so both of them are palazzo pants
so the first one that I got I liked it a
lot because that's kind of like what is
it floral kind of tribal accent to it so
it's a really nice kind of white Brown
brownish reddish like mixed color and it
does have cool prints on it I thought
that these were cool now one thing is
I'm not a tall person I'm about 5'4 and
a half inches tall which is not tall at
all so I kind of have like the weird
type of body where I'm kind of shorter
and then like I'm bottom heavy so
therefore with issues like that it's
like when you put the pants on it
actually has to go over a few features
on the on the back side so therefore the
more features it has to go over the
shorter the pants leg is and if you
what I'm talking about leave your
comment down below because I'm pretty
sure a lot of people deal with the same
issue top four tops it's kind of
different like if you have larger boobs
you'll probably make some of your shirts
would actually end up being the crop
tops but for me some of my pants will
end up being like capri pants which is
kind of weird especially kind of
material pants like this so this one
kind of lands a little bit short on the
ankles I wish it was kind of like one of
those well cover up my foot
this one doesn't kind of stops I've got
a word area so with these what I
probably do is kind of like get some
nice over the knee heel boots or
something like that it's kind of like
some flat boots Arkana or odd boots or
something like that and tuck them into
the pit into the boots just because I
don't like the bottom of the pant flag
but I do like the pattern and everything
like that it does come really nice and
another thing I noticed they do cut kind
of low so you do I mean like if you have
a tramp stamp like I do you probably had
that exposed which is a little bit so
like I said where the top like with
pants like this outbreak kind of like a
loose long top so it can cover the
imperfections of the pants but overall I
do like the design of them so I guess it
works so the next ones are also kind of
like a polyester cotton mix type of
pants as well - these are mmm you know
what I'm saying they're kind of like
that mixed material almost kind of like
a costume material speaking of Halloween
happy Halloween people cuz by the time
you see this it's Halloween so these are
kind of like a polyester mixed type of
pants they do have the wide leg as well
and like I said the pants the back of
the pants has to go over my butt so
therefore it kind of pulls a little bit
of the length away so with these I also
do have an issue with these being kind
of like high water issues in a way which
is kind of sucky but what I would do
with these ones is tucking them into
some boots and wear like an oversized
top with it and maybe a cardigan sweater
and kind of like like develop the outfit
differently from what it was supposed to
be so those are things have been doing
when you kind of have like pants and
stuff like that that didn't really work
out you can kind of turn the pants into
something else which I'm probably going
to do with these but I do like it's very
soft and comfortable so if you're
looking for like a very soft material to
wear something that's not too tight to
cut you know like something that's
really loose and free I think that these
pants will work they're really really
nice pants guys honestly and truly okay
so the next thing I'm gonna show you
guys are like three screen tees we're
kind of like graphic tees and I
a few more to show you guys but I'm
gonna start off with these three cuz
these are actually my three favorites so
the first one that I got is this really
cute one that's grain has white writing
so a business says hashtag hashtag
hashtag dog mom and I just thought it
was really cute I'm I really I love gray
material so much for the fall season in
the winter season like a nice heather
gray color looks like really good and it
did have the white writing so I was like
you know what I'm a really nice like
sneaker wear heavy white sneaker wear in
the winter time and I do like the gray
so let me get these so I thought this
shirt was cute it's a size extra large
guys and I thought that it fit really
well the sleeves for me were kind of
tight in a weird way and it kind of came
a little bit longer than I expected them
to so it's like kind of like one of
those weird tops but I do like the
material this shirt it's more it's not a
polyester it's a cotton top and it does
look good it's very comfortable and it's
an extra large so you do have a lot of
breathing room in it like if you just
ate like a large meal you definitely
have some breathing room where you're
not popping off the scene so I thought
that this was so cute and I am a dog mom
so I gotta appreciate a shirt that
represents Who I am so I thought that
was cute so the next shirt it's kind of
really trending and I've seen this like
on a lot of people so I got this one in
extra-large too and I love this so much
guys it's really it's really edgy really
fun something could definitely style up
style down for any type of occasion so
it's a basic black top with the kind of
like a right fire writing that says
Thrasher Magazine I just thought that
this was really cute I envisioned so
many cool ideas of my outfits sneakers
jeans and stuff like that with it so I
was like to myself let me pick this one
out it is a size extra large but you do
get a lot of area space in it so
therefore you are not like kind of
confined I'm all about being comfortable
on the winter season especially because
you know you're gonna have a jacket on
most of the time anyway so what is the
point of wearing like this really tight
outfit on with a big ol puffy jacket
nobody's gonna see so I'm more soba cool
chill relaxed type of chick in the
winter time I turn my loose top so I
lose this kind of baggy pants you know
and try to keep it real you know cute
but comfortable so I thought that this
top was really cute
you depakote where this is some ripped
jeans some sneakers maybe a pencil skirt
and some little heels like you could
just really go crazy with this it is a
really trending top notch I've seen a
lot of people with this so I just
thought like it to myself oh damn you
could find
really cute things to wear with this so
I picked it on I'm really happy it is
long and it fits like a t-shirt but it's
more so of a girl t-shirt so it does
give you a little bit of accentuation on
the curves if you know what I mean now
the next topic I'm not gonna put it up
to the light too much because it'll wash
me out like it usually does white and
all these bright colors with the wash me
out so we're gonna do a quick flash
there you go so it's basically like a
tie-dye top and I thought it was so cute
so I'll show it on the screen obviously
you guys know so it's basically like a
tie-dye shirt and it kind of has like
this cute little elephant in the front
pocket and then on the back and the
elephant I think it says ivory Ella I
don't know if that's the elephant's name
but I every Ella is a brand of this
elephant or the elephant name now one
thing about this top that kind of threw
me off was the polyester material I
initially when I saw that was maybe like
a cotton material sweatshirt or kind of
like a cotton material shirt but it's
not guys it's more sort of like this
kind of polyester ish kind of material
which always throws me off so make sure
when you're shopping on these websites
guys make sure that you look for the
detail of the items like the clothing
detail just because you want to give
something and be like what is this is
not what I thought so this is defi kind
of like a polyester style material but I
do like it guys though it fits really
nice it's comfortable and there's ways
to style up and start down like with me
I would wear with my kind of burgundy
style leggings with some ugg boots or
some Minnetonka boots and put a little
jacket over it and call it a day that's
basically like what I like to wear in
the wintertime I like to keep you a real
simple real cute real fresh so I thought
it was cute I do like it and I would
recommend buy they had a variety of
colors for this one and I believe I got
this one in a size extra large or large
but I will link that down below for you
guys so the next screen tee that I got
guys and the last green tea that I got
is this really cute one now it's a black
crop top style screen tee and it says
body goes on it I thought that this was
so cute when I saw it on the website
guys so I picked this one in the size
large and it's a little bit bigger than
I thought so what I would recommend is
if you have at the smaller top and you
kind of want to size your regular shirt
size with this one I would recommend
sizing down to like a size medium it is
really cute I think I'm gonna save this
one for the summertime they'll just
because right now I won't really be able
to wear it the way
want to so save it for the summertime
and where it just says hashtag body goes
on it I thought it was a really cute top
and you know what's funny like with all
types of fashion and stuff like that and
like the world is evolving right now who
cares
body goes before used to be like skinny
European stick you know that used to be
the essential beauty right there but now
nowadays anybody's about ego your body
go I'm a body girl
we're all body goes and as long as
you're confident yourself you can be the
body girl you want to be so I definitely
thought this shirt was a very cool
motivational type of shirt for women
plus-sized women curvy women all types
of women so it's just setting the
standard to explain to people that you
can be a body girl I can be a body
though everybody and anybody can be a
body go so I thought this was really
cute so I'm gonna say this for the
winter for the summertime or springtime
just like a bust out in it like yes body
goes so I definitely am gonna keep this
one for a little later into the year of
next year preferably Wow this year is
coming to a wrap that's crazy so the
next thing I'm going to show you guys is
this cute little great it's a shirt and
it's pretty long so I don't recommend
wearing a t-shirt because they're slits
on the side that are way too long so I
thought that this was cute guys it's
basically like this gray top now it's
gonna wash me out so let me just hold it
to the side now it comes with these two
nice slits on the side and it's
basically like a great kind of like a
shirt dress now the reason why I
wouldn't recommend wearing this without
bottoms on is because the slit comes up
way too high so I definitely think this
will look cute with like jeans maybe
leggings over the knee heel boots long
boots just flat boots whatever sneakers
whatever I just like the color gray for
the fall it's just like such a nice
heavy gray color throw on a scarf with
it and a leather jacket and you're just
you're just looking like everything so I
thought it was really cute I did have
black I believe in some other cause but
like I said there's something about gray
that just really sets everything into
motion so I picked out the grey one it
is long it's really nice and the way
that they put the slits on the side
definitely accentuates your curves a
little bit because it cuts you in the
right area so that's one thing if you're
a curvy woman and you want to accentuate
your curves find those types of shirts
that have the slits that come up right
underneath kind of like
right where your boobs are at and gives
you kind of like a little bit of a
curvature because dole shirts will
always put you right where you need to
be honestly now the next thing I got
it's kind of it's supposed to be kind of
like a nightgown slip dress type of
situation but Dom had like other ideas
for this so when I first saw it on the
website
hmm okay this can potentially be
something I were into a dress no
honestly I thought I was gonna wear it
as a dress and I'm actually thinking
about wearing it as a dress so I'm
definitely trying to do like something
for New Year's meeting like I'm trying
to do like a dinner with my boyfriend
for New Year's I said I go I don't go to
the club like that anymore anyway so I'm
thinking like maybe I'll do like a New
Year's thing I definitely have like a
Christmas a Christmas party and stuff in
my house and then I want to do like a
New Year's dinner in the city so I'm
trying to find like outfit ideas and
stuff like that now I'm really like I'm
like I like to dress up but I like to be
as much as casual as possible I like to
be comfortable so I thought that this
was queueing this can definitely be like
something to wear for like um like New
Year's honestly so it's messy like a
slick dress guys and it does have like a
great like lace detailing on it now it
is black and it's a little bit bigger
than I anticipated I wish I had got in a
smaller size I believe I got this in a
size extra-large if I would have got a
size large it would it just fit a little
bit tighter and carried me a little bit
better the boob area is a little bit too
big for my breasts so I'm gonna have to
find a way to finagle this one and kind
of change it up but it's definitely
queue and it has like this great lace
detailing on it it does either tie up
they do have a little two little tabs in
the back but I'm not sure if this goes
through here I'm gonna have to figure
that out and it's pretty long and at the
end of it it does have a lace detailing
as well so it's like a really nice dress
guys and I even thought to myself like I
could wear this with sneakers and I love
a jacket and be like totally cool with
it and you know put a different wig on
and just and just be you know you know
what I'm saying so I had those I
envisioned that in my a knows a girl you
could do this so I don't know I thought
this was cute let me let me know what
you guys think you can tell me just this
one on justice justice up or dresses
down so I had all those ideas in mind
I'm like y'all honestly I'm not even
wear this to New Year's or there's a
couple fashion over dresses that I have
that I might even come up on New Year's
with because let me tell you something
I'm trying to look sexy but this one is
queued everyone look sexy a guy
honestly mm-hmm all right guys so the
last two things that I got our Pinsky
accessory items I didn't get any bags
this time with shoes and that's kind of
weird for me because I usually always
pick out like stuff like that but I did
it this time so what I'm gonna show you
guys is this cute little faux fur I'm
kind of like like collar thing I got and
I wanted to get this one just because I
was like you know sometimes you don't
want to wear a big jacket you want to
wear that little leather jacket you want
to kind of let kind of have like a
little bit of a extra fling to wear or
you know what I mean
so I was like let me just get this and
try it out so it's basically like a
black little fur collar collar that's
what it is black for a collar so I
decided to get this one so I could test
it out now they did have it in other
colors but I was kind of like skeptical
about the other colors it does have like
a little bit of a clasp area right here
so if you want to that's my bag it has
like a little a little area where you
actually stick the end of this one into
it and hold it together so you kind of
have it like situated like this so I
thought that this was cute guys and I
was like you know what those days when I
want to wear my little thin Jack and I
want to act like I'm secure and I'm not
cold I can just put this on with my
leather jacket and just go out like hmm
oh yeah I'm not cold not at all I'm
comfortable mm-hmm knowing damn I'm
freezing but I thought it was really
cute and it's just an accent you know
just putting it on with your outfit and
trying to really change the look up you
can wear with your Blazers and all that
kind of stuff just trying to give
yourself like a little bit more of a
pick-me-up or put the outfit together
the right way take the situation so I
thought that this was cute so I picked
this one out now the next thing I got I
have to come out with my with my scars
for the season and my favorite type is
Scott's with the season or my tartan
scars my plaid stars whatever you want
to call it so this is the one that I
picked out it's a tan one and it has the
traditional traditional plaid style
color so I was really really excited
about this guy's so let me just show you
guys what it looks like once I put it on
hairs all in the place and this is
definitely winter here guys I will link
this in the video for you guys up here
if you guys are interested in purchasing
this here off Aliexpress because these
are what I like to call your winter
curls so this is what the scarf looks
like guys and I and
in heaven I love this scarf this is
definitely one of those scarves that
sets you up for the winter it looks
absolutely amazing guys I love it's a
chunky sweater chunky sweater boy
it's a chunky scarf and it's definitely
one of those really nice warm scarves
it's nothing at all
it is a bit of a thicker scarf so
therefore you got a lot of layers to
work with but then again if you're
wearing like a little jacket like I said
before that wooden little jackets try to
be cute you definitely I would
definitely recommend putting a scarf on
to kind of carry you through so people
ain't looking at you like girl I know
you cold I know you cold so definitely
adding these types of pieces to it would
definitely carry you through the winter
if you're trying to be queueing it
listen I understand like I sometimes I
would like to remind little leather
jacket but let me tell you something as
soon as I attempt to do stuff at I get
sick in the quickness so be sick this
year guys to be saved alright guys so
moving along so I'm gonna show you guys
some shoes that I got from public desire
calm now public desires a uk-based
website but they actually do ship the
stuff pretty fast cuz I've ordered from
them before in the past so I'm gonna
show you three pairs of shoes that I
picked out that are actually pretty
trendy right now so almost like you know
what let me show my subscribers what
they got so if you're from the UK you're
familiar with this website and if you're
not I'm pretty sure these fashion savvy
sisters out here and girls and all y'all
lovely ladies out here know exactly what
I'm talking about
so the first shoe that I'm gonna show
you guys that will link the information
down below I don't remember the name
I do I remember the name of this one I
don't know I was so fabulous when I saw
on the website I was like oh my god but
I'll link it here for you guys so you
guys know exactly what it is so this one
is the one of the really cute ones that
I picked out now this platform style
heel thing has been really trending and
I'm the type of person I cannot wear
those little little heels I have to have
like some type of support with the
platform so all my shoes are usually
like this and they do give me maximum
height so I usually order by my shoes
like this height now these shoes are
really nice guys a diamond a UK size 7 a
US size 9 now they're really nice and
platform they do have a bit of an arch
but you do get a lot of support because
of the platform heel so you don't have
to worry about being like really nervous
of falling over anything like that these
really do support you a lot and they're
very very comfortable guys
do you like these a lot and you can
definitely style these up or down like
these are definitely it with jeans or a
dress you just lookin like you lookin
like everything so I did like these a
lot so I picked these out I'm definitely
to wear these for the holiday season so
hopefully I can get a lookbook in a
couple of holiday Look Books and for you
guys because that would be really great
because I know you guys would appreciate
that a lot
now the next shoe I got is pot it's been
trending for you or like maybe like the
last year and a half here or two so
basically at the clear style heels now I
have never purchased one of these before
and I just picked this one out from
public desire now I like these because
they're simple now they're simple to the
fact that they're clear so therefore if
you don't have shoes to wear with
certain outfits you can put these on and
get away with it like this so they are
the bottom is like a clear is um the
bottom is like a tan color and then you
get like the clear strapping this does
have an arch in it but like I said with
the supportive that with the support the
chunky on the back you really not gonna
be stumbling rumbling fumbling and all
that kind of extra stuff you'll be
really supported why did I just get so
brave
anyways so you'll definitely get a lot
of support from these shoes so that's
why I pick stuff like this out with this
type of heel check email because it
really carries you if you're not someone
that's like really like can really walk
in heels like that and I hate little
heels I do fine and chunky heels but
them a little little thin heels no I
cannot so I I never you know play myself
I go straight for heels like this
because this is what works so you
basically have to do what works for
yourself and not try to do other extra
stuff because that stuff just never
works just be true to yourself and wear
what you know you can wear stop trying
to be like everybody else honestly so
the last pair of shoes that I got from
them are these over the knee Hill boots
now I have wide cabs so I was looking
for some shoes that could fit my calves
now these are really stretchy and just
off the strength of seeing kind of like
the banning area right here you would
know that they're stretchy so when
you're looking at these on the website
if it does carry kind of like a band
like this chick cha-ching you know that
they're gonna be stretchy so as soon as
I saw that I said you know what those is
gonna be it
now I got these in this nice burgundy
color because I wanted to I have black
ones I'm like I'm gonna do like a car
this time I absolutely love these guys
so these are Chucky Hill as well like I
said I don't try to play myself so I got
the Chucky hill as well these are super
duper comfortable guys like I feel I
feel super sexy in them I can walk a
mile in these and there are just
everything like especially with the fall
even if I paired it up with this
beautiful scarf like and like a bodycon
dress in our let one of my oversized
jean jackets guys this is this is it so
honestly I highly recommend if you're a
wide calf type of girl like I am I
recommend checking public desire their
shoe selection or their over the knee
hill bullshit shoe selection because
they definitely have shoes that will fit
I have a hard time buying shoes that
will not if you find ones that have like
a stretch panel to it you are in that
safe zone because I have a hard time I
could go to Charlotte Russe and I'm not
able to fit one up there over the knee
hill boots that aren't white cap I can't
fit them my my legs will not fit that so
I'm very thankful to public desire for
having shoes that fit all types of
calves because that's a major issue and
everybody wants to be fabulous like I
want to wear stuff like that so public
design definitely has them so check them
out cuz if you got white calves like I
do you are gonna be shopping in the
right area for the right shoes guys so
the last things I'm gonna show you guys
are from a company called soulful calm
so they basically sent me some cold
charm bracelets custom charm bracelets
as well as the name necklace so I'm
gonna pull everything up to the side so
you guys can see it because it's gonna
be really hard for me to show you guys
directly cuz it'll kind of mess up the
scenery in a way so basically there's
somebody's really cool charm braces that
I picked out three of them so they did
come silver they didn't have gold ones
like this they kind of had like this
weird kind of rest color but I prefer to
skin in the silver because silver and
gold who cares so basically they're like
little custom charm bracelets and I got
like little pictures so I got this
little cute picture of me which is one
of my favorite pictures so egocentric
then I got this really cool charm of me
and my boyfriend right here along with
this really cute heart one with my dog
in it and they're like really cute
they're almost kind of like that outs
and Auntie bracelets charm bracelets you
can customize putting your
so basically what you do is upload the
picture from your computer and they'll
kind of like minimizing kind of make it
fit the charm so it's really cool
because the pictures actually look
really really close to what an actual
picture would look like so the company
worked really hard getting back done so
they definitely are skilled with that
these gifts these are perfect gifts guys
for like the holidays kind of showing
you prefer guys to watch my channel if
you want to buy your girlfriend a really
cute bracelet and kind of put a picture
of yourself and her together would be
really nice too
along with a female too if you want to
buy yourself a bracelet custom bracelet
or across from a custom necklace with
your boyfriend's name on it you can do
that too I have a name necklace on with
my boyfriend's name on it because I'm
corny like that so I do stuff like that
too I also will show you guys the scene
of the charms that I got so I got a cute
little charm that's it's like a doggy
bone it says Pablo on it my dog's name
is Pablo I thought it was really cute
they also sent me this really cute heart
styled one it's kind of like a red
colored heart charm as well too I also
picked out this cute little infinity 2
hand piece kind of charm as well too and
they're very hard to see right now but
I'll show you guys to them on the side
and I also got this cute little elephant
charm bracelet charm for my bracelet as
well too so there's like cute little
things you get attached on it I thought
they were really nice and just a cool
little accessory to add on to your looks
if you want to kind of be more jazzy so
the last thing I got from them is the
name necklace now this name necklace is
a little bit different from what I
usually get this is a different kind of
colored necklace so this is kind of like
one of those really yellow gold
necklaces I usually tend to like the
kind of like the kind of darker gold
necklace meaning like this one that I
have one right here but this one is
actually not that bad guys I'm actually
going to wear it up a little bit and the
longer you wear this one it'll be a
little bit more darker in color and it
just has my mother's name on it Marie so
I thought it was cute and I picked this
one now it's definitely you could adjust
it three ways let's say you could
actually adjust it four ways it has four
hooks on it so you can adjust it four
ways to kind of get it to be tighter and
longer tighter longer shorter whatever
but it definitely is going to be a cute
little piece and I love my name
necklaces if you guys know I always wear
named necklaces all the time alright
