Wednesday so in today's video I'm going
to be showing you guys a wig from a
company that I previously worked with
and this company is oMG her hair calm
now the last unit that I got from them
was excellent I had no complaints about
that hair and actually a lot of my
family members and friends have
purchased wigs from that company since I
review for them so they have no
complaints either so the company's
quality hair is pretty good guys and I'm
very very pleased with their products so
I did go ahead and work with them again
now this unit is a 360 wig unit
basically meaning like four inches of
parting series at the top and then like
about two or inch and a half fighting
straight to the back what this wig is
basically more suitable for is if you
want to stand in like high ponytails
high top bun and stuff like that and
just a wide variety of styling methods
that you can use with it so I'm going to
shake hands with the unit looks like
it's about 18 inches long and silky
straight Indian remy hair and it's just
a natural color I really think it's
really nice and soft guys and I always
do the ponytail test when it comes to
wigs is to make sure that it's enough so
this would be enough for a ponytail it's
not the thickest ponytail but it's just
enough right here to make it look
realistic realistic so this is what it
looks like on the inside the inside has
three cones at the top and has two on
the side of one at the base and there's
one's a lace up there it actually says I
believe this has a pre tweeze the front
of the hair I'm probably going to go in
and just fix it up a little bit myself
the last unit I got was pretty good it
wasn't thick at the top or anything like
that and this one doesn't look big
either but you know you always have to
customize
your unit so I'm probably going to
customize this one it does have like
that stretch stretch cap in the inside
so you don't have any visible tracks
showing there is one common the back
part and also a lot the adjustable strap
and then you'll get some weights in the
back just adhere that down so therefore
the baby hairs will be appearing in the
back when you try to do that the high
ponytail or something you have some baby
hair covering the back of your head so
that is excellent guys but what I'm
going to do it too soon is I'm going to
kind of do something different have a
lot of long straight black hair
especially this one that I have on now
and kind of it the same color so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to dive it
here I'm not going to show the whole
dyeing process on this if you guys are
looking for a dyeing processing of this
hair hopefully it comes out looking the
way I think it's going to be then I can
do a video for that because I think this
is going to be cool especially for the
springtime when it comes to Diamond hair
you don't have to bleach the hair prior
to using these products you just put
them on the hair with a 45 developer or
20 whatever you want but I recommend
using 40 bottoms developer because 40
volume developer really get straight to
the point and it dies in here precisely
the way you want it to so yeah so I'm
going to do this and I'm going to see
how it turns I'll probably leave it on
for about an hour and let it kind of
marinate in the hair and then I'm going
to dry it out and see what the style
looks like the ends aren't too straight
so I'm going to kind of just blunt the
ends on the way just to keep it kind of
like a straight look I'm not going to
make it a short you know I'm going to
keep the 18 inch link I'm just going to
blunt it out and then try and then like
salad in a ponytail for you guys so
hopefully this works out make sure you
stay tuned and keep on watching
happy
ah
I'm back and this is what the unit looks
like now as you guys know I did dye the
hair and I was hoping and I'm so happy I
didn't record because I have been so
disappointed that I gave you guys that
you've been asked recording on dyeing my
hair this time wasn't the best dye
I was looking for more like a violent
violent violent bright kind of look some
of those just made the place look a
little bit different but instead it just
gave me a burgundy color and if that was
the case I could have just bought the
L'Oreal techniques red hot or red hot or
magenta color to get a burgundy color
which is the one I usually do from all
my red units but this one I tried out
their little color and the colors didn't
come out like I wanted it so it is what
it is I still think that this looks
great the thing I liked about this hair
is Pierre version here like I said
before you can dye whatever color you
want I got this little burgundy look
which is good I did receive a little bit
of shedding when it came time for me to
dive in here which is typical of when I
was watching I did receive shedding but
after that went the air dried out it was
perfectly fine no shedding and it's 18
inches long so stuff like right where my
boobs are at which kind of seems to me
more like a 16 inch I'm so used to
wearing like 22 inches 24 inches at
please it's kind of different but one
thing I like about this is this natural
appearance it looks for very realistic
it's a silky straight textured here so
it looks like you just got your hair
straightened and the length is perfect
for middle part styling I think a middle
part looks killer in this it just looks
so natural I did go in and cut like a
little bit of layers in the front right
here which is so uneven whoop
god I probably have to go on to fix that
but I cut like a little and the four
inches so if I want to do curls or
something it'll cascade backwards and it
was just so kind of more naturally um it
will look more natural if I had like a
little bit of a layer whatever so that's
why I cut a little bit of layer in the
front the hair texture is great I love
the quality of the year two guys I do
receive a little bit of static nasaan
the hair dye and all that and the
straightener but you just put a little
bit of oil on it to keep it maintained
down and flat it is a very very sweet
guys very very sleek and pretty
you can't do curls but I probably want
to do curls with this one just because
it's not as long as I would like it to
be if it was about 20 22 inches and I
would have put curls it but it would
just look so short and funny so I just
will leave it like this straight
and probably rock it this way guys so
make sure you thumbs up this video guys
leave your comments down below I will
link the direct link for this wig down
below for you guys I won't forget to
mention you can rock this in a ponytail
hmmm I don't know yet maybe but you have
a different stuff to do with it it does
have a lot of parting space for you to
do braids and stuff like that I probably
come back with a styling video for 360
waves closures front toes whatever you
want to call it but yeah so my shades up
comment down below and subscribe if you
have it and I will
ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
