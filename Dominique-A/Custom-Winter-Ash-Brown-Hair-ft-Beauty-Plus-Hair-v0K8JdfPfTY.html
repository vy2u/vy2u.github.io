back today with another hair review now
there's hair reviews a little bit
different I am looking on my phone now
so I can actually find the email so I
don't mess anything up for you guys but
I will link down everything down below
for you guys if you're interested in
knowing what this hair is and all the
products that I used to achieve this
kind of brownish ash color this hair was
sent to me by a company called beauty
plus here after Aliexpress and it's been
a while since I've done an al Express
based company here in view and I gave
this one a try just because I wanted to
do a frontal for the first time so this
is a unit with three bundles in a
frontal I was set to 16 inch frontal a
20 inch at 22 and a 24 inch bundle
obviously I've cut the hair just because
a lot of those long length bundles that
you receive from these Ali al Express
based companies tend to be very thin at
the ends so when I got this hair
initially it was really thin at the ends
and I was just kind of like I knew that
it wasn't going to work out that well so
what I decided to do is just kind of cut
the hair just bluntly and I cut it
straight through like this on both sides
and it actually came out pretty even
guys so I cut it blunt and then what I
did was bleach the hair and then I added
him um I believe it was a dark ash brown
or light ash brown I'm not sure but I
was insert in the video say yes and see
how I did that and it was a very simple
process
I think this here is a really nice kind
of a winter look it's not like a blonde
summer blonde or like a summer light
light color it's pretty much like I try
to get like kind of like a fall inspired
and winter inspired like light brownish
ash color and I think I did really wide
gains I've been getting so many
compliments on this hair color so I
guess it's nice so like I said I will
link everything down below for this
company and like I said the hair company
is called Beauty plus hair from
Aliexpress so they contact me a couple
weeks ago and I decided to finally get
the review out for you guys the hair is
very nice a process perfectly I did
receive like a little bit of shedding
from the bleaching process before I got
the hair didn't really sweet really
receive any shedding but obviously once
you process the hair you will get a
little bit of the clippings from the end
I'm at receiving kind of long length
strands I'm kind of receiving just
little strips of hair like gradually
coming out like just little pieces when
I'm calming and brushed
it it does tangle in the nape area a
little bit which I have noticed lately
that it does tangle the nape area which
is slightly annoying as how because um
you're constantly like especially when
you're wearing a jacket you have the
back of hair like ruching out like that
and it's like really embarrassing so
you're constantly having to kind of pull
your hand out back through like this and
bring it up so you kind of get the hair
to loosen the hair is this is all three
bundles and this is the frontal at the
top it's a pretty good friend so I do
kind of help you guys to see that I do
go in and kind of like fix it up I
didn't glue this one down just because
you guys already know I'm doing like a
whole bunch of hair of you so I just
didn't want to glue this down and have
to rip it off my head and try something
else on so I just kind of put it on I
did where it glued down for a couple
days especially during New Year's I did
wear this unit for New Year's and I
absolutely loved it I got so many
compliments in the last haul video that
I did for this hair and I know you guys
were excited so I had to bring this
video out today other than that I think
that cutting it made the hair look
better especially because if I would
have left it on the longer lengths it
would have been a mess and if you order
from Aliexpress before you know exactly
what I'm talking about when I'm telling
you that the longer hair has really thin
ends and I just didn't want to go for
that look so I customized this hair to
my liking I hope you guys think it's
nice I will insert you've also seen this
video I've inserted how I did that
process so that you guys know that it
wasn't a hard process and when I
literally tell you guys that I just put
the hair dye on the hair I legitimately
just pour all the hair down the hair and
then I just that's it so I did process
by bleaching first and then I called the
hair after to just achieve this look I
try to do like some streaks and I try to
make it like a balayage or whatever but
I'm not professional so I kind of got it
like if he Bali eyes but I really liked
it and if you do want to glue your
frontal zone you can glue your frontal
zone I will linked on the link for a
video that I did two weeks ago on how to
use the gossipy glue method to glue my
units down that video seems real helpful
for a lot of people who watch it so if
you're interested in seeing how I glue
my units down you can check out that
video I'll link that video down below
for you guys and that's about it guys
this is not a long review um hopefully
maybe I'll come back with some more L
Express based companies I've been really
chilling on that lately just because
they've been really funny with their the
cup
very funny but this company is really
good I'm very happy and pleased with
this hair and is actually it's been a
while since I've gotten really good hair
like this and I'm very happy with this
company so like I said everything will
be linked down below make sure you
thumbs up this video guys also leave all
your comments down below and subscribe
if you have it and I will catch you guys
later bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
