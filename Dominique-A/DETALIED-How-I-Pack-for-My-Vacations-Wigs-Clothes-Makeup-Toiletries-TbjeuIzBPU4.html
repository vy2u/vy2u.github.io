a fashion Friday video so today's video
is a little bit different so by the time
you guys watch this video I've already
I'm already in Thailand right now so I'm
on Thailand for 10 days I went on a
Thailand tour or whatever vacation
whatever you want to call it so
basically I'm gonna show you guys how I
pack for my trips just because I did
bring a lot of wigs with me and stuff
like that because I was kind of doing
this video the trip is gonna be a vlog
and it's also gonna be a lookbook as
well so I wanted to kind of have all my
things set in motion before I get there
so I'm prepared for any footage that
needs to be shot during the trip so I'm
gonna show you guys what I brought with
me as far as travel items like soap the
order and stuff like that and also I did
do like a small medikit as well too just
because I've never traveled this far out
so I want to make sure that in case
anything happens we're kind of covered
when it comes to like you know benadryl
stuff like that and I also bought like
I'm gonna show you guys how I also kind
of pack my wigs to go I pre styled and
preset all the units before I'm bringing
them out so therefore I would recommend
you doing that bringing styling tools
and stuff is cool whatever but like you
don't really want to lug around with all
that stuff I usually preset the wigs
before and then when I get to tell them
they're already ready pull out the pack
and I'm done so I'm gonna show you guys
how I set them in the bags and tie
everything gets put into my luggage some
of the items that I have are going to go
into the check bag which my boyfriend
has but I'll show you guys the items
that I'm gonna put into the check bag
and most of the items that are gonna be
in the carry-on our items just in case
of luggage gets lost we have these items
just in case so you got to keep that in
mind so guys if you're interested in
seeing what I have to offer in today's
video then stay tuned and keep on
watching alright guys so I hope the
cameras settled here perfectly where you
guys can see everything in motion so
what I'm gonna start off with now is the
stuff that I'm actually checking in the
check bag so we're standing for ten days
so I don't know if I overdid this or
whatever but I wanted to make sure
everything was cool now instead of
getting body soap guys actually got bars
so at this time because it's the worst
thing when you open your luggage and you
realize that they're so busted all
inside of your clothes so I wanted to
avoid that even though I got lotion I
kind of feel like it always happens with
the body wash so I got bar soap instead
and I got two of the Dove ones these
actually smell really good so I got this
the next thing I got was a V no lotion
daily moisturizing lotion I got this
just because I didn't want to bring the
little travel-size one it's not going to
last
I'm probably gonna be Ashley more often
because I'm going to a lot of water
activities and stuff like that so and
got the real size one instead and also
that baby oil too just because I like
sometimes I like to be a little bit oily
and you know swim wise and stuff like
that even though this does attract bugs
if you use this with your off spray
you're pretty much all set so I got this
as well too just for an extra gloss
extra shine I also got some face wash
from Walmart this is the equate brand
and it's an energizing facial cleanser I
use this all the time and I do take my
makeup off with my micellar water so I
do that first and then I wash with this
one it tells you that on the micellar
water that you can just do it without
washing your face after but I just don't
trust that so I actually washed my face
after than micellar water so this is
what I use and it was like three dollars
and 47 cents from Walmart the next thing
I got is the SPF 50 sunscreen and I got
the sports one just because if you're
sweating it will keep the actual spray
on you so therefore you can avoid
getting sunburned so definitely trying
to avoid not getting too too burnt this
summer I was peeling like crazy last
summer so I'm trying to avoid that this
summer too and this vacation so I got
the SPF 50 and the sports version I also
got the off spray and I actually have
two actually had one for my last trip so
I'm gonna bring both I got this one and
this is a family care one smooth and dry
I use this religiously I'm not saying
just because in other countries there's
mosquitoes everywhere you go and I just
hate getting bit by mosquitoes like it's
the worst the scratching the itching the
oh my god it's just like terrible so I
definitely gotta bring two of these just
because I want to make sure that I am
like drenched in this before I go
anywhere with shorts on anywhere with
anything that's like slightly skin
exposed so I'm definitely bringing this
when I'm bringing two of them I also got
two optic optic white toothbrushes these
are actually pretty cool very simples
like 2 $3 so I got to pack one for my
honey and one for me then I also got the
toothpaste and I didn't get the regular
size in this one just because toothpaste
is like I mean it's a you do like a line
morning night line it should last pretty
well so I got two of the small ones I
think this will be fine if not then I
probably just take the toothpaste I have
here and take it with me but I thought
that's gonna happen so I'm probably not
gonna do that so I got two of these I
also put I use a specific feminine wash
and it's not I don't know it's like a
cranberry one or whatever something for
like I don't know something like
refreshing I don't know what it is
but I put in here just because I don't
want to bring the bottle and I want to
keep some here so I put in here it's a
really good smells like cranberry I
forgot the name of it but I'll list it
down below for you guys it's a really
good feminine wash so I use that and I
brought brought it as well I also got
two travel-size deodorants one for men
and one for women degree ultra clear
it's pretty simple and you only need one
the mini ones will be fine for ten days
sliding OD on these I just got two I
also got Listerine I didn't know which
one to get I usually use a cool mint so
I saw the Total Care one and it was
purple so I said you know I'm gonna get
it because it's purple so I got the
purple one and I also got the cool mint
one and we don't have to split it we can
just share it's not a big deal I just
wanted to get two just in case you never
know you might lose one and got one
laughs so I was maybe I'm overachieving
right now I don't know let me know in
the comment section but I kind of went
above and beyond this time so speaking
of the micellar water when I went to New
Orleans last week I bought the micellar
water and obviously it's kind of it was
full but now it's kind of like at like a
really low scale I'm probably gonna have
to clip the top off of this one and I
have like a large sized one so I'll
probably pour some into here but I
thought about it after I was like you
know what I got makeup wipes anyways so
I'll probably use the makeup wipes in
this together to kind of get my makeup
off and who knows if I'm gonna wear
makeup every single day
probably just wear makeup with the
portions of the days where I'm actually
doing my lookbook so I'm not sure if I'm
gonna probably use all of this but this
stuff right here guys it's not sponsored
or whatever I would tell you guys right
not to bottom by this this is really
really good it gets all your makeup off
guys and like it's the best thing ever
it doesn't leave your skin dry it has
like a little oil base to it so
therefore it'll kind of keep a little
moisturize after but like I said
with this product I also use the face
wash after just to kind of you know give
my skin an extra brightness and just get
really clean like I really don't I trust
this but I don't trust 100% so I would
say use this first and then go in with
the exfoliating scrub and use exfolia
scrubbed after just to make sure you get
all the makeup off it's I definitely
recommend this and I did pick up the
actual the cosmetic pads from Ulta so I
have a whole pack of these and I bought
these two they're actually pretty big
size these were a dollar and I usually
use this with in my cellar water too so
I'll just pour it on the pad and then
just wipe my makeup off I use about two
or three of these so I bought this with
me as well too just because I don't want
to use tissue tissue is the worst to use
when you're taking makeup off so I use
that with in my cellar water or I also
use just a regular makeup wipes and I
got the equate brand it comes with 10
sheets sometimes I'll split the sheets
in half and use one sheet one day and
one sheet another day but because I have
this corresponding I should be fine I
probably would even use the entire pack
to be honest with you guys so this may
sound corny but I did bring some face
masks to I don't know what the weather's
I don't know what the you know if it's
the pollutions like over there how the
air is I kind of feel like whenever I go
somewhere my skin is affected by certain
conditions and I know that sounds corny
I know I'm not crazy and I know other
people feel the same way that I feel so
I just want to make sure that I kind of
take care of my skin while I'm there
because sometimes if you go to the place
that's really polluted the air is really
you know dense it kind of really affects
your skin so I did bring two face masks
one med mask and then one gel cream mask
just to kind of like you know when I'm
like taking my makeup off in the end of
the night I can kind of like do like a
face mask or something just to kind of
get my skin you know nice and clean and
kind of safe I don't know I'm just weird
I saw and I was like you know I can do
that it's not like I'm gonna be running
around the entire trip doing this and
that so I can actually take some time
and do a face mask out of the what ten
days that I'm there so I bought two face
master Walmart now I also got the equate
flushable wipes I got these guys because
I'm like I am NOT against toilet paper I
love toilet paper but sometimes having
like a nice wet wipe expressed on the
plane the plane isn't
it's a 19-hour ride and some for some
reason toilet paper to me if it's not
soft paper I'm kind of like really weird
about that so I bought two packs of this
it's 18 wipes these are pretty large
wipes as well guys so if you want to
split this in half you can just cut it
in half and use one wipe and then like
just like put the shove the other white
back to end these are really good
they're flushable so they're not like
going to harm the toilet or harm the
plane or harm the facility you're
staying and the resort you're staying in
so these are pretty good guys I didn't
want to get a full full pack just
because that's really heavy
and imagine if you know some type of
impact hit it would squeeze all the
juices on your clothes I know that
sounds weird but I'm just maybe I'm just
like really like really like worried
about stuff like that but I got these
two you know one for him one for me just
in case or correspondingly use it
together but I thought this was good
this is like a dollar 97 so I got two
packs now I'm gonna save this portion
for last because I want to go into that
section to talk to you guys about my
wigs after so I'm just gonna run through
this stuff so what I did was I did like
a little medicate guy so what I did is I
went and I looked up not looked up I
found some things that I thought that
would be suitable for a plane or for a
trip anyways so I got a first aid kit
and I know that sounds corny because a
lot of like a lot of like hotels have
first aid kits but if we're doing
excursion and there's no first aid kit
and I got like bit or something like
that I'm gonna have that the first aid
kit with me just to make sure that I'm
safe so I got a first aid kit comes with
band-aids like your basic stuff basic
essential first aid items guys so very
simple if you got like if you have like
a deep puncture wound or someone stabbed
you this is not gonna help you probably
have to go to the hospital but for minor
incidents and minor situations this is
probably gonna work really good so I got
the first-aid kit
now I also got Dramamine now these are
the trouble tablets now this is just for
it prevents nausea dizziness and
vomiting so just in case you're nauseous
from like a the plane ride or like a
boat ride or whatever like getting on
the back of an elephant or you know
whatever it is or if you just have like
a really they were having like a really
bad you know GI issue or whatever and
you feel really nauseous you can use jam
I mean it really helps it's a
quick-acting thing so you're not going
to be sitting there waiting for it to
kick in it'll it'll really help you out
try
got this one and they're just about I
think it's like how many true it's for
orange flavored chewable tablets so
it'll just help you now the next thing I
got is the anti diarrheal and I got the
equate brand I was not going to get the
regular brand imodium if you guys know
the monuments anti diarrheal I just got
the generic brand it comes with twelve
tablets and it's two milligrams and you
take this one
if you ever travel like often you'll
either have the bubble guts and certain
food that you eat from the country
sometimes it doesn't agree with you it
could either be the water or it can be
the food now to prevent any situations
from happening per se I would definitely
recommend next time going on a trip to
bring some anti diarrheal it'll help you
out tremendously so I definitely brought
this with me the next thing that I got
is benadryl now benadryl is something
that I would highly recommend you bring
with you now with benadryl it can either
be anything that happens to you can get
like bit by something you can like a
mesquite or whatever and could initially
swell up even if you have allergies you
know to bring your EpiPen your benadryl
the protocol everything but for some
people that don't have allergies and
just could get bit by something and just
their lip swells up or whatever
Bennett Jo definitely works to reduce
the symptoms of it and if it does you
know kind of persist and you go to the
emergency room or whatever in the area
that you're in but just for like rashes
or anything that happens if I touch
something and I feel like I'm slowing up
or you know I see a rash appear take
benadryl is the first action plan and
then you know proceed on depending with
the symptoms you know persist too but I
would just recommend bring a benadryl
just in case because you don't know the
country you don't know what not to touch
you know you just want to make sure and
I think that this will definitely help
you when you go out there so there's my
little med pack guys so the next thing I
got is just Advil I personally feel odd
field works faster than title and this
one entitles every six hours this is
every four to six hours so if you take
tie it off first the first six hours you
can add this in and then kind of like
Connor I go back and forth with it but I
definitely feel like a leave advil work
faster they do a better job with pain in
general compared to the title title
takes a long time to kick in and nobody
has time for that and if you have a
headache or anything like that I
definitely recommend getting yourself
like a little
advil they work pretty good and they
pretty much keep you where you need to
be throughout the entire trip so I
definitely recommend getting Advil
now the last thing guys that I got is
just hand sanitizer and no shade on any
country or anything like that I'm not a
germaphobe I'm someone that's really
like cool about stuff but I just want to
make sure that I'm not bringing germs to
people and I'm not taking germs back
with me so I want to make sure that I
wash my hands as often as possible and
also apply hand sanitizer if I don't
have a facility where I could wash my
hands just to make sure I kind of
minimize the germs and I'm not bringing
anything back home with me and I'm not
bringing anything to them or bringing
stuff back to my hotel period so
definitely bring hand sanitizer with you
just to make sure that you cover all
bases and just make sure first thing
hand-washing now one thing I'm gonna say
is this pack that I created it's
actually gonna go into my book bag so
throughout the trip when we're going on
excursion the stuff this will be my med
bag so along with my like money and
stuff like that this will go into my
book bag with me so therefore anywhere
I'm at any place I go I will have this
pack with me just in case we have an
emergency and something happens so I
call this my med bag guys as corny as it
sounds this might actually help us out
like a lot so yeah all right guys so
this is the part that you guys probably
want to hear so I'm bringing four units
with me guys so I'm bringing this short
curly hair that I featured a few days
ago that you guys have already saw I
absolutely love it i co washed it's
beautiful and this is the curly hair
that you guys have been asking me about
as well - this one guys honestly - god
I'm not joking - with you guys this hair
is everything guys like I love that this
is a hair from Wiggins hair company guys
and it's their malaysian wavy hair
believe it is don't quote me I'll leave
it down below but guys I made this unit
this hair Aiko watching everything
beautiful so I will be taking this long
curly black one this short curly black
one and this luxurious long black one
that I'm sporting right now along with
my favorite blonde one now I know you
guys are probably like girls just stop
but I am doing the lookbook so I wanted
to make sure I have my styles and stuff
ready so that's what I'm going to
so what I'm gonna do to pack these wigs
up guys is I'm going to use the wick the
packets I got from the wig companies and
I know that sounds corny but it's
actually a smart idea if you think about
it so I'm going to place the wigs into
these packs right here I'm gonna just
show you as an example I am gonna put a
fish net a fish net and net over it so
that it can protect the curls and stuff
like that so what I'm basically gonna do
is take them and put them back in the
packs of hair away with it wherever I
don't know I use random backs from any
company and I'm just gonna put them in
like this with a hair net and voila
shove it in the back shoving and luggage
just like that and I don't know the curl
pattern will still be intact with the
net over and everything like that gotta
be perfectly lined and settled in the
luggage so therefore when I'm ready to
take my wig out all I gotta do sign my
wig out and I'm ready to put my wig on
now I pre-wash pre-styled all these
units guys and I did going with my
powder and add the powder on it already
so therefore I don't have to do anything
all I have to do is just put the wig on
and be done if I want to add water to
the wigs I can add water to the curly
units I did go in and pre part and pre
well these were already pre part if
those for the blonde one I actually
parted it to the side this time guys and
I did add some curls in it so it's
already curled and the curls are kind of
like curls at the roots and then
straight at the ends which I like so
this is already pre parted pre powdered
pre everything the wig is in its full
glory guys I'm just gonna simply roll
the wig up like this put it in the pack
and then that's it so these are already
done now as far as styling products like
I tried to mention to you guys before
I'm going to be bringing the mini got to
be glues now it is hot in Thailand so I
have to be very careful with how I use
these products most of the wigs that I
have guys have elastic bands on them so
therefore I won't really need this only
reason why I need this is for the baby
hairs which I probably won't do too much
of because it's too hot so if I'm gonna
do baby hairs you guys know I use the
black one and I use the yellow one just
kind of interchanging it and I also do
use the yellow one to cool them down but
I really don't think I'm gonna glue
these down depending on the weather out
there but these will be the only two
products I bring with me too
here my wigs for the ten days now as far
as styling tools I'm not bringing any
styling tools the way the hair is curled
right now if I do spray with a got to be
glue an instant freeze spray it'll last
so therefore I don't need to bring a
curling iron for this hair this hair is
whatever this hair looks like is what
its gonna be and I guarantee you guys it
will last I don't have to bring that
code out and straightener curler all
that stuff no no no no this is gonna
last like this this is all I'm bringing
and this is what it is so yeah so those
are all the units upbringing and come in
you know with this one as well too
so it's four units two curly ones two
long straight ones one blonde one black
and two black curly wigs so that'll be
my Styles and I'll incorporate those
into the outfits which I will show you
guys okay so as far as clothes I kind of
kept it really simple for this trip a
lot of alright guys so as far as clothes
I kept it really simple for this trip a
lot of people were saying that it's best
to wear lightweight stuff just because
it's really hot out there and stuff like
that so I'm gonna start off with shoes
and stuff I'm gonna just show you guys
the basics so I only bought one pair of
shoes these are knockoff Skippy's these
are actually from Primark and I bought
them for seven dollars if you guys don't
know me by now I hardly like I really
really tell you guys Primark is where
it's at if you're looking for
inexpensive stuff Primark has it like
just straight up so I would buy $7 shoes
and these are really cute fresh crispy
white shoes I did kind of beat them up a
little bit but you know what I mean so
they're crispy white where these with a
cute little dress or whatever very
simple I bought these for seven bucks
and they're comfortable I also got a lot
of flat sandals guys these aren't really
good they don't hurt my feet in this
part doesn't hurt either a lot of people
complain about the actual thong part
hurting their foot these are fine for me
I got two pairs and these are size 9 I
believe or 8 these are really
comfortable I got these really cute
dressing ones from Rainbow and I thought
these are cute
I'm a really fan of these buckle part
but I like the whole single toe gold
area accent so I got these as well I do
have two other pairs at my boyfriend's
house and they're kind of like the tan
colors so I'll just get those after but
these are basically kind of the things
that I bought I didn't bring no
expensive sneakers I didn't bring any of
that kind of stuff because I don't want
to rule
so I just kept it real simple only
bought one pair of sneakers and just a
whole bunch of sandals now the good
thing about Thailand is guys it's really
inexpensive out there so if I do need
another pair of shoes I can just buy a
pair they're actually pretty cheap they
have a lot of knockoff things like
Yeezys and stuff like that so your girl
will be the one trying to buy some now I
did bring two bags I bought a fanny pack
which I thought was really cute just her
excursion purposes it was that product
for like six dollars and like I said I
don't care if I talk about karma too
much it's not a sponsored video by
Primark they're just legitimately the
 so I went there and got this one
very nice has little compartments I can
even fit my camera in here to be honest
with you guys and a couple of other
things but yeah this is cute got this
back from Primark to a while ago was
about like four dollars and check simple
cheap and when I'm going on to dinner
we're going out to like a like a party
or something like that I have something
real simple to kind of start up with
doesn't have to be ultra fancy hair and
makeup on point outfit on point you good
so I did pick up some wings from Primark
- very simple I'm a gold accident type
of person got these I also got some
regular earrings I'm kind of stylish
kind of like glam II so I picked these
out - I thought thought these were
really cute no I got the dangly earrings
huh I got two pairs of these now I'm a
really gold fanatic person these were
four dollars of $0.50 now if this came
in a yellow color it would be terrific I
only saw it in blue and red and I just
fell in love with this so I picked these
out I know this is a little bit extra
but like I have often ideas that can go
into extra zone so I really wanted to
kind of you know just be myself and
dressed nice and weird things that I
like so I definitely picked these down I
absolutely love these earrings guys they
are so freakin pretty so I definitely
have to get these two these these
earrings now as far as the clothes part
guys let me just shift this over so what
I did was I rolled the clothes in here
because I'm gonna have to switch this
out eventually with my boyfriend stuff
in conjunction so some of this stuff
will stay in here just in case and I
know this sounds crazy but I'm gonna say
this to you guys just in case the check
bag either gets stolen or lost you need
to make sure you have a couple of
outfits in here like combined like
boyfriend and girlfriend you guys have a
couple of office in here just in case
that checked in bag gets lost that's why
a lot of this stuff like my wigs and
stuff like that will be with me
I'm not losing my stuff no no no no so I
kind of will have to change this up a
little bit put some of his stuff so I
kept it real lightweight I'll show you
guys examples and I rolled everything up
so I put like these kind of maxi dresses
something real simple real light and
guys what I mean this is like this is
like the lightest maxi dress I've ever
seen in my life I did bring leggings I
bought biker shorts as well too if you
guys remember my mono cheeks video that
I posted up about the jeans I bought
those really cool jean shorts I mean
this isn't really a something that's
appropriate for just regular stuff they
are they do practice um do that are they
Buddhists they have like a really strong
religious background there so I don't
want to offend anyone um so I'm gonna
have to kind of be careful when I wear
certain things like this or put a
cardigan on top short shorts for them or
kind of like a No so I gotta you know
respect the culture too so I'm gonna
kind of be worried about the places I go
with certain outfits so I kind of did
the wrong method in here now one thing
I'll show you guys from prime work that
I would recommend you guys purchasing
they have these really nice kind of
woody Khali's trial tries or wide wide
leg trouser pants if you guys do not go
to pomegranate and get these you guys
are insane these are marked as $11 guys
and their wide leg to the floor trouser
pants now I got to I got three pairs I
got this kind of eggplant color right
here
I got a mixed color which is the one
right here it's kinda like a black and
white box color and I also got a full
black pair now these three will be in
trend and transition or that transition
and rotation because they are so freakin
comfortable and lightweight so air you
guys like crop top and these or like a
tank top and these are just definitely
going to be what I'm gonna be wearing
very very nice very comfortable I got
these in a US size 14 now I fit the 12
but I want it to be I fit the 12 but I
wanted to be like kind of like loose and
flowy and kind of like relaxed I wanted
that relaxed feel instead of kind of
being like all tight and like you know
like nah so I got these in a US 14 guys
these were $11 like $11 it's like you
guys need to get on this like you guys
need to get on Primark I don't know if
you guys if you live in Connecticut hit
up the Danbury fair and more cuz they
have it on
in there everything it's like I go there
every Sunday and Sundays when they get
the new stuff and I always get the new
stuff I always get it so yeah I also
bought like a couple dresses like late
night dresses just one dress I'm not
gonna show you guys so they're probably
wear it anyways and you guys will see if
I take a picture
I bought rompers that I had from a
couple of years ago I did get like a
little creek crop tops from forever 21
and stuff like that I did bring a parrot
pack of thongs
socks sports bras and stuff like that
and just like really cute stuff that I
will show you guys in the vlog and in
the lookbook so you guys will see that
but basically what I did guys was roll
them up to kind of make it more compact
I do have a lot more room in here I can
actually put like another layer stuff in
here but I will kind of move some of
this stuff into the check bag so
therefore we actually have some items in
here together and most of the rest of
the stuff in the check bag so yeah so
that's about it alright guys so that
