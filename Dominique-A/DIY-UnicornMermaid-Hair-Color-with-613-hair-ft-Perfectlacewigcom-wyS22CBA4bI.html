first I'm gonna try to saturate like
maybe let's see like thirty three
percent of this week and I'm going to
put the pink at the top and do it in
section so it always like no matter what
you're doing you heart it always goes
pink purple and blue now I do wish I
would have done like purple at the root
but more like blue instead of the pink
the pink doesn't look off the bat like
it's gonna come out very bright but it
turns really really bright which kind of
freaks me out a little bit but you gotta
make things
you like it straight like this obviously
have to add touch-ups to it but it's a
little flat for me so I definitely not
going to like this like but I do like to
color overall
so what I'm going to end up doing is
just going in and deep
all right people for the sake of trying
something new I attempted this unicorn
style unit now this is not something
that I usually do on my channel but I
tried to do something different just
because I'm bringing you guys a little
bit of different fire so this hair color
was achieved using the kiss hair dye and
I got it from the beauty supply store so
this was actually printed very well this
time guys so I got all three bucks here
- for about fifteen dollars they were
four dollars and 49 cents plus tax so it
was a great deal now adorn is definitely
a great hair dye to use and I've used it
in the past but I wanted to try
something different out and see kind of
Li you know what their level of you know
quality was so as far as the hair dye
goes guys I think the hair dye is
actually pretty good the hair coloring
came out it's very successful but one
thing I want to mention to you guys
I would definitely highly recommend you
mix the actual hair dye with developer
it does come in the bottle but I kind of
feel like the bottle dye is a little too
thick and to dilute it a little bit is
definitely important to mix it with a
little bit of 40 volume developer or
whatever developer you have laying
around cuts up for the volume doesn't
really matter it's gonna pick up the
color if the hair 613 so this unit came
to me 613 guys it's a full lace wig has
three combs in the front a comb in the
back and adjustable strap now as far as
this wig fitting guys that actually fit
pretty good now I did have to go in and
customize the ear tabs just because they
didn't land the right way that I wanted
it to and some of the parts were
actually sitting on my ear and besides
going directly in front of my ear so
kind of fix that up so all you do is
just kind of cut it and customize it to
your your head the cap itself was
actually good but like I said the ear
tabs are just kind of a little too large
in this area so all I did was cut them
up a little bit and try to fit it now as
far as baby hair goes don't even ask me
about that because I didn't do it I
don't know if anyone else mentions it
mentions this in their videos who do
coloured hairs baby hairs are extremely
hard to do with colored hair I don't
know what it is I don't know if it's
kind of like your the foundation that's
on my face already that mixes in with
the color or whatever contrast happens
it just never works out that well so I
opted just to leave it the way it is
what I did was glue the unit down and
allowed the baby hair to stick to
whatever got to be glue was left on my
forehead and that's where the baby hairs
were created and it just makes kind of
like one of those natural kind of
flipped sails I did initially try to do
a part on this one but the part to me
was just a no bueno and just didn't work
out as well as I expected it to so I
just decided just to do a flip over
method and you guys already know what it
is crimping is my thing so I did do like
a nice deep way set to it to kind of
give you guys the full unicorn full
mermaid colored style effect I
definitely think that the pink is a
little bit too bright for me I do like
the purple and the blue I feel like the
purple and the blue transition very well
and it looks like nice but I kind of
feel like I should have got a darker
pink the pink is darker at the root but
when you get like a little towards the
middle it just gets a boat right so it's
a little bit throw off you but I can
deal with this I can actually work with
this one pretty pretty well all right so
that base gave wraps up today's video
guys I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial hope it was informative on how
I showed you guys how I died this hair
and stuff like that now I will leave all
the information down below in regards to
the hair dyes that I used to achieve
this color along with this unit that was
