a quick review on what my hair is
looking like now and as you can tell i
posted a video last night up longer here
and it wasn't wig that I did put on a
dome cap but I took that wig off and I
decided to do something a bit shorter
because if you guys haven't noticed who
lives on the east coast the weather is
switching on us right now so it's either
cold one day and really hot the next day
and it's just way too hot for me and I
can not have it here on my neck and
stuff like that so I decided hey why not
let's do a shortcut I have done a
shortcut previously like a couple months
ago and I love the short hair style
everybody loved it on me too it kind of
makes me look a little bit older than
what I am well I don't want to look like
a teenager because I'm not a teenager so
you know it's kind of fitting into my
career and how old I am so therefore
it's a good thing and I'm 21 by the way
so I'm not that old but I'm not a
teenager I'm an adult now I'm a young
adult so yeah so basically I got a 27
piece I know you guys think this is my
natural hair but this is definitely not
this is the Milky Way 27 piece that i
got from their beauty supply store for
10 bucks and I got in a number one and
this is a shake-and-go pack and the it
also usually comes with a free cap
closure and a shower cap which I didn't
mean I don't know what I did the shower
cap I should use that but I don't really
use that I just put a head scarf on and
take a shower um and I brought I only
needed one pack and I have so much hair
left the hair that's in the front of my
head right now this here is a some
chinese version here i had and some
mixed kind of years i just slept
together because i wanted the front of
the hair to be like you know like to be
crazy and big so that's that's that's
how i like it so i put like a bunch of
other like expensive here because i cut
curly and I could wedding they'll just
be really cute and I've done it before
so I know exactly what it's going to
look like and what I expect it to look
like so basically it comes like a bunch
of lengths i got some some right here to
show you guys this is I probably like
the longest length that you'll get out
of it and I I put those probably like
towards the top of the hair like yeah
those are choices top of the hand and
this is probably like one of the second
to the largest one and it's
this size and the smaller smartest one I
look peeled through this frickin pile
and I still can't seem to find that
anybody itty bitty one but then any
bitty bitty one it's probably the one in
the back and i'll turn around to show
you guys what the hair looks like so
that's what it looks like an idiot a
bitty one would be the one all the way
in the back of my head so what I did was
I decided to leave my natural hair out
and I've been natural for a while so
what I did I actually went from natural
so relax um whatever I could always cut
the hair back off because I like we've
anyways so I really just where we've no
matter what so if I ever wanted to know
just basically cut the hair off and redo
it again and I'm okay with that because
I wear wigs I wear lace firms I don't
wear wigs wigs but I wear lace front
wigs and full lace waist that's just
what I like and it's I like week because
you can switch it up as many times you
want to you could be this person that's
day you could be that person that day
but at the end of the day I'm always
mean I just like switching my hair up a
lot so what I did was I relax the front
of my hand is yes until my hair is like
finally out when I did burn my stop with
the perm right here and it's like stuck
in I'm sketching mood but next time I
wash my hair I'll get this party moved
out but I relax my hair and as you can
see it's all going to relax and I left
like this much of hair out at the top
and then I lay the tracks down living
down and i took this is not my hair this
is my hair in here so what i did was i
just took the curl and I curls it over
and I just finger comb the end together
to mesh together when I did for the bang
part is I lay the tracks downward so
therefore um all the hair comes down
this way and the thing about this one is
if you want to do be all Barbie and
princessy and want to throw your hair
back you can do that because I put the
baby tracks in the front right here so
it's kind of going like it looks it
looks decent it looks pretty good so I
just put the little tracks around it so
if you want to do like a mohawk kind of
look you actually do it because I left
some of my hair and it also did put the
baby pieces in so if you want to rock a
style like this you're able to do it
what I do it mmm maybe but if you want
to rock your hair like high up like this
you can do that
so it's a plus you can do I also did
like a brain in front of my hair I can
put make a nice little fat braid and I
picked pinned it up my hair and it was
cute but if you that's why I mean you
can do whatever you want with this and
it's the easiest here sell all you got
to do is wake up in the morning press
the hair like take the iron put some
like a little bit of a little bit of oil
on it or sheen on it and press it down
with the iron curl it tuck it and then
alright I just shake this up and you're
good to go and literally I get so many
compliments people love my freaking here
like this it's good so it was very
affordable if you ever want to
transition from long hair while
transitioning from long hair to short
hair is a big transition and it's kind
of awkward because I'll go to short hair
for like a month and then I'll jump
right back to long hair so everyone's
like oh my god you know for the people
that don't know about extensions or
stuff like that this is also a weave for
you ones out there that rock in this
video and our coolest this is a weave so
weaves can either be long or short I
mean take it as it is but honestly I
love this and I began so many
compliments about how natural looks how
people are like oh is that your real
hair stuff like that and of course I'm
gonna say yeah I'm not a while I'm not
gonna you know tell them it's not it's a
wheat price night you guys know my
secret but most of my friends were
shocked when I saw they're like wow it
looks so real so um yeah so that's
basically what it looks like and like I
said very affordable if you don't want
to go and really cut your hair this is
the best alternative way to do it and
all I did was use this one stocking cap
and i molded my hair back into like a
little miniature bun and I gelled it
down and letting and I blow dried it so
it could be hard and firm and then I put
the cap on and once I got to the top of
the hair I cut the cat and for you guys
don't know how to do this at Google
extensions down so what I used was the
Nattie's bonding glue and I use this go
to glue my extensions on so this is
really good it lasts a long time I
haven't had any slips on it and I've had
this hair styling for maybe a week
almost coming up to a week so it's
pretty good so um if you guys have any
questions just leave your questions down
in the comment flats and i will post a
video tomorrow about my makeup look
today and this is um basically my
everyday makeup look I'm going to be
honest with you guys is just what I
probably look like every day mine is
still white right here I just started
doing colors down there and i will show
you guys the way i do the blue one it's
so so so so pretty in my opinion but i
do do papa colors at the bottom because
it just makes my face look so much like
bright and pretty so um just leave a
question or a comment at the bottom i
will do an eyebrow and eyeliner i will
do a whole half of the face review for
you guys to show you guys with my
everyday makeup looks like and what i do
