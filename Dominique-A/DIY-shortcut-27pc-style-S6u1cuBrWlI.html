do a quick review on what my hair is
looking like now and as you can tell I
posted a video last night up a longer
hair and it wasn't wig that I did put on
a dome cap but I took that wig off and I
decided to do something a bit shorter
because if you guys haven't noticed who
goes on the East Coast the weather
switching on us right now so it's either
cold one day and really hot the next day
and it's just way too hot for me and I
can not have it here on my neck and
stuff like that so I decided hey why not
let's do a short cut I have done a short
cut previously like a couple months ago
and I love the short hairstyle everybody
loved it on me too
it kind of makes me look a little bit
older than what I am well I don't want
to look like a teenager because I'm not
a teenager so you know it's kind of
fitting into my career and how old I am
so therefore it's a good thing and I'm
21 by the way so I'm not that old but
I'm not a teenager I'm gonna dump now
I'm a young adult so yeah so basically I
got a 27-piece I know you guys think
this is my natural hair but this is
definitely not this is the Milky Way 27
piece that I got from their beauty
supply store for 10 bucks and I got in
in number one and this is the shake and
go pack and the it also usually comes
with a free cap closure and a char cap
which I didn't even I don't know what I
did the shower cap I should use that but
I don't really use that I just put a
head scarf on and take a shot um and I
brought I only needed one pack and I
have so much hair left the hair that's
in the front of my head right now this
here is a some Chinese version here I
had and some mixed kind of years that I
just slept together cuz I wanted the
front of the hair to be like you know
like to be crazy and big so that's
that's that's how I like it so I put
like a bunch of other like expensive
here because I cut curly and I could
wedding those just be really cute and
I've done it before so I know exactly
what it's gonna look like and what I
expect it to look like so basically it
comes like a bunch of lengths I got some
some right here to show you guys this is
I probably like the longest length that
you'll get out of it and I I put those
probably like towards the top of the
hair like yeah those are towards top of
the hand and this is probably like one
of the second to the largest one and
it's
this size and the smaller smallest one I
look peeled through this freaking pile
and I still can't seem to find that
anybody any bitty one but then any bitty
bitty one it's probably the one in the
back and I'll turn around to show you
guys what the hair looks like so that's
what it looks like and the idiot any
bitty one would be the one all the way
in the back of my head so what I did was
I decided to leave my natural hair out
and I've been natural for a while so
what I did I actually went from natural
so relax
um whatever I could always cut the hair
back off because I like weave anyways so
I really just where we've no matter what
so if I ever wanted to know just
basically cut the hair off and redo it
again
and I'm okay with that because I wear
wigs I wear lace fronts I don't wear
wigs wigs but I wearing lace front wigs
and full lace wigs that's just what I
like and it's I like wheat because you
can switch it up as many times as you
want to you could be this person that
stay you could be that person that day
but at the end of the day I'm always
mean I just like switching my hair up a
lot so what I did was I relaxed the
front of my hand is yes until my hair is
like finally out when I did burn my
scalp with the perm right here and it's
like stuck and I'm scared to move but
next time I wash my hair
I'll get this front part moved out but I
relaxed my hair and as you can see it's
all gonna relax and I left like this
much of hair out at the top and then I
laid the tracks down lay them down and I
took this is not my hair this is my hair
in here so what I did was I just took
the curl and I curls it over and I just
finger comb the end together to mesh
together what I did for the bang part is
I laid the tracks downwards so therefore
all the hair comes down this way and to
think about this one is if you want to
do be all Barbie and princessy and want
to throw your hair back you can do that
cuz I put the baby tracks in the front
right here so it's kind of going like it
looks it looks decent it looks pretty
good so I just put the little tracks
around it so if you want to do like a
mohawk kind of look you can actually do
it because I left some of my hair and I
also did put the baby pieces in so if
you want to rock a style like this
you're able to do it what I do it
mmm-maybe
but if you want to rock your hair like
high up like this you can do that
so it's a plus you can do I also did
like a braid in front of my hair I can
put make a nice little fat braid and I
picked pinned it up my hair and it was
cute but if you that's why I mean you
could do whatever you want with this and
it's the easiest hairstyle all you got
to do is wake up in the morning
press the hair like take the iron put
some like a little bit of a little bit
of oil on it or a sheen on it and press
it down with the iron curl it tuck it
and then I'll just shake this up and
you're good to go and literally I get so
many compliments people love my freaking
here like this it's good so it was very
affordable if you ever want to
transition from long hair while
transitioning from long hair to short
hair is a big transition and it's kind
of awkward because I'll go to short hair
for like a month and you know jump right
back to long hair so everyone's like oh
my god you know three people that I
don't know about extensions or stuff
like that this is also a weave for you
ones out there that rock in this video
and our coolest this is a weave so
weaves can either be long or short I
mean take it as it is but honestly I
love this and I began so many
compliments about how natural looks how
people are like oh is that your real
hair stuff like that and of course I'm
gonna say yeah I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna you know tell them it's not but
it's a weave Christ now you guys know my
secret but most of my friends were
shocked when they saw they're like wow
it looks so real so um yeah so that's
basically what it looks like and like I
said very affordable if you don't want
to go and really cut your hair this is
the best alternative way to do it and
all I did was use this one stocking cap
and I molded my hair back into like a
little miniature bun and I gelled it on
and let and and um I just blow dried it
so it could be hard and firm and then I
put the cap on and once I got to the top
of the hair I cut the cap and for you
guys don't know how to do this I glued
extensions down so what I used was the
Natty's bonding glue and I used this
glue to glue my extensions on so this is
really good it lasts a long time I
haven't had any slips on it and I've had
this hair styling for maybe a week
almost coming up to a week so it's
pretty good so um if you guys have any
questions just leave your questions down
in the comment box and I will post a
video up tomorrow about my makeup look
today and this is um basically my
everyday makeup look I'm gonna be honest
with you guys is just what I probably
look like every day mine is still white
right here I just started doing colors
down there and I will show you guys the
way I do the blue on its so so so so
pretty in my opinion but I do do pop of
colors at the bottom because it just
makes my face look so much like bright
and pretty so um just leave a question
or a comment at the bottom I will do an
eyebrow an eyeliner I will do a whole
half of the face review for you guys to
show you guys with my everyday makeup
looks like and what I do for like
certain color eye popping colors like
blue purples and this white that I do
right here but this is basically what I
look like every single day trust me I
don't change it up I just this is just
the way I like it but thank you guys for
stopping by if you have any questions
like I said leave them down below and I
will be sure to get back to you guys and
now that I know how to work this mag
