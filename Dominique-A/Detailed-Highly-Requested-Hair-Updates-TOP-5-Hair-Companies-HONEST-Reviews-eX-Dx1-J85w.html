today with another video so today is not
going to be a hair review day so today's
video is going to be a hair update so a
lot of you guys have been asking me to
update you guys on certain units that I
recently been wearing so I'm gonna kind
of go back to a few units so I can kind
of tell you guys how I feel about them
now if you watch my channel not only my
hair reviews you'll see my fashion
videos and some makeup tutorials and
stuff like that you'll notice that in
those videos I usually show you guys
certain units on heavy rotation even in
my fashion videos I'll kind of like mix
my outfits with different wigs just
because that's how I am a hundred
percent of the time of like in my
general life I usually wear my hair
based on what my outfit looks like so
and most of those units that you guys
see me showing are units that I
absolutely love and I will honestly wear
forever and ever and ever so therefore
you know that I with those wigs and
those companies now I will name a list
of companies that I can tell you guys
straight off the bat i 100% feel like
they are SuperDuper great I have not
been disappointed by any of the units
that they sent me they've always been
extremely great and I wear those on
heavy rotation so um I kind of feel like
sometimes you guys get frustrated
because you guys will order the units
and some of us on YouTube who review the
units we actually have great experiences
with them sometimes they don't have all
like the greatest experiences and I'll
let you guys know if it's not good some
of the units that I get there probably
customized units that the companies have
sent me the recent one that I did was
like that
Auburn colored one and I told you that
straight up if you're not someone that's
wig savvy that can spend that type of
money to phonate that way the lace was
orange and it was kind of like what's
going on I personally would not buy that
wig for myself and I wouldn't recommend
you buying it if you didn't know how to
fix it it is an expensive wig it is
nicely it's a nice color so nice concept
or whatever it's a good concept to look
at but like I said that's not a wig I
would recommend like people who watch my
channel to buy just because some people
are weak savvy and some people aren't so
if you are with savvy you'll be able to
handle something like that by pulling
the color off the lace for instance but
I try to keep the videos as kind of like
try to make them as affordable as
possible and try to make them as
understandable like expression when
applying the wig so I try to give you
guys that type of video setup and not
all the time you're going to give videos
like that most of the time you're gonna
get just like straight reviews and stuff
like that but I'm starting to think that
adding these monthly updates will help
you guys understand the review and
understand the wigs more so that you
guys don't just make a Rastus rash
decision and purchase the wig and then
get mad at me I hope that the companies
are being you know respectful and are
being honorable and they're sending you
guys the same exact units that they're
sending us I used to be just like you
guys and I used to sit right behind my
computer and watch YouTube videos which
I still do to this day and spend my
money on bundles and stuff like that
after I watch the UM other youtubers
review them so I know exactly what it's
like when you have your own money you
spend you work hard for your money and
then you end up buying something and the
thing is like pure but when we get
the wigs when I receive the ways
whatever wigs I receive I personally
give you the review off of what I got so
I'm expecting and I hope that the
companies are being as loyal as possible
and are sending in the exact same way
that I received I don't know what kind
of tweaks are doing Tikas people are
saying oh I bought it and it was nothing
like that
that's that's frustrating as and I
do understand where you're coming from
because I used to buy wigs too and I
used to buy stuff and but the thing
about is I never used to blame the
youtuber I know this sounds weird I'm
not trying to say don't blame me because
your frustration could be like on
anybody it's your opinion I don't really
get mad when you guys put like your
comments down below and I kind of go in
on me or things like that because it's a
free platform did I ever used to do that
stuff on when I was at when I used to
watch other do this video no but hey
that's what I signed up for so um yeah I
don't want you guys to think that I'm
like lying to you guys or I'm like
telling the company send me the good one
and send in the trash so if you guys
have issues with that you guys need to
contact the companies but if I start
seeing a trend of a certain coming that
I'm reviewing you guys are saying the
same thing I'm just going to stop
 with that company in general and
give you the reviews for the companies I
believe strongly will provide you guys
at the best quality wigs so guys that
was like a long-ass intro but I wanted
to do that before I got into the video
I'm gonna try to make this video not so
long because I want to try to give you
guys my overall opinion about the unit's
kind of give you guys a little bit more
trusting heart a trusting feeling when
you're purchasing your wigs and just
based off my opinion that you guys are
kind of confident a little bit more so
guys if you want to hear about what I
think about these wigs stay tuned and
keep online okay so starting off with
the companies I'm gonna name them the
companies I can obviously 100% tell you
guys that I flock with hard so the first
coming to tell you guys is oMG Queen
hair now every single unit I receive
from that company I've been in love with
their company has like great variety of
hair wigs color stuff like that now most
of the ways that I usually pick from
that company are mostly natural style
wigs I have done some wig reviews for
them with colored Styles they do have
like pink blue on all that gray kind of
colors I'm not really a big fan of that
but I recently reviewed a pink unit from
them and I absolutely love that unit it
was really really nice for Valentine's
Day they do have like curly one short
little curly ones stuff like that
straight ones yaki straight ones and
things like that that I really really
did like the cap construction is your
standard cap construction for those
units and they just look great I have
not had any issues as far as shedding or
tangling with those units they're really
solid and they stay like that for a long
time so I definitely reviewed those wigs
and have not had any issues with oMG
Queen hair at all now the second company
which I absolutely love is our PG hair
now these lists the listen give me right
now they do have affordable units I'm
somewhere a little bit on the pricey set
about 300 but I don't think anything
goes past 3 you can get some good deals
from these companies from like starting
out like $99 so um it's pretty
inexpensive pretty affordable
so our PG here guys I love yaki textured
hair and this company is probably the
one company that I have gotten yaki
textured hair from that has been
absolutely excellent every single unit I
receive in this company that's been yaki
textured has been amazing the cap is
great it has like a nice realistic look
it's pre plucked and everything about
this hair company has been sod from day
one even before I started reviewing some
of their units I so watched other
people's videos and I was like Tam they
have some
stuff even other colored units or ombre
style units have been good as well too
what I'm really really big about with
that company is their yaki textured wigs
so if you're someone that likes yaki
textured hair I definitely highly
recommend check out our PG here com they
are super affordable guys and the hair
is a freaking one now the third company
that I really like as well too is my
first wigs comm now I'm gonna use my
first week's comm regardless if I have a
wig line with them every single unit
that I've received from this company has
been great I have not had any issues
with their hair whatsoever now this
company is definitely styled in detail
dialed and created for a first time with
wares and witbier so if you're someone
that really doesn't know anything about
hair and is just starting off this
company has a great platform for you to
just begin with every single unit I've
received from them has been great
quality the hair lasts a long time they
do give you a lot of parting space and
it's just everything about it they think
about they think about a lot of what the
buyer the customer would like and they
also think about like the arrangement
when you're putting it on that's the
first company that ever noticed that
actually gave you that extra patch of
lace on the back of your wig your 360 so
that you can actually glue it down there
the first wig company that has ever
created a wig that has that patch on the
back so when I start what I notice that
they're the only one that did I was like
yo they actually really think about
stuff like that when they construct
their wig so they're very they're very
smart when it comes to constructing the
wigs the quality is good you can either
get ya silky texture yaki texture and
for some reason I'm not a silky texture
type of person but they're silky texture
it's okay for me I actually really
really like it and obviously I like the
yaki as well too now the fourth company
guys that I absolutely love as well its
oMG her hair calm now onto your hair
calm is super affordable as well two
guys that have reviewed wigs for them
for a while now now one thing I bought
them guys is they have a wide variety of
styles as well too and every single unit
they've sent me guys has been solid now
I did recently review a curly unit from
them and guys that curly unit was the
business so I did a floor review showed
you guys hi stealth and all that kind of
stuff I even brought that
they're with me today baÃ±o and writer
bring I brought another unit from them
with me when I went I went to Thailand
recently and it just did very well
so these wings guys they hold up very
nicely this website on G R here is very
affordable as well too and I have not
been disappointed the first video that I
did with them was kind of like the first
one when I really started doing YouTube
again and that wig I still have it till
this day and it's actually really really
good guy so those four companies are the
companies that can tell you 100% oh I
forgot one the last company I'm gonna
tell you guys about is China lace wigs
calm now I did I do a lot of videos with
China lace wigs calm and honestly guys
the ways that I do for them all of their
units hands down are pretty plug their
pre plug game is probably number one I'm
not gonna lie so this is one thing about
this company that I want to say they're
pre plug game is number one I have not
seen a company do pre plucked as well as
they do they really get into the wig so
therefore you don't really have to go in
and even if you're someone that doesn't
know how to do that stuff they pre pluck
it so well around the corner around the
perimeter so therefore you don't have a
lot of work to do the wig construction
the cap construction is excellent they
do have like your regular standard cap
adjustable strap and everything some of
these companies aren't even nice enough
now they're adding elastic band to it
and I think two of the companies I just
mentioned do so they're really stepping
up their advances when it comes to
creating wigs that are gonna work for us
China and lace wigs has collar units
that I love they also have great 360
wigs that I love as well too and if you
don't want to spend a lot of money on
360s they have the lace front wigs that
are kind of like a fraction of the price
and that are great as well too so those
are five companies guys that I can 100%
say that I've not had any bad
experiences with every single unit that
I've gotten from these companies have
been the best units like that you can
get I don't see any failure any flaws
with them if you're trying to be if
you're someone that's really kind of
scary with stuff like that I would say
start off with the most basic way from
one of these companies and then work
your way up I want to say go out to one
of these companies to buy a pink wig or
buy a purple wig or buy like a really
super super curly wig kinky curly wig if
you don't know how to use it or how to
maintain it
I would say start off really basic with
maybe like a straight Bob unit and then
work your way from that and also watch
my videos on how I install them then you
really know how to do it then but those
are the five companies that are hundred
percent can say to you that I have not
had any issues with I did I do know that
some people complain about premiere lace
wigs I don't really do videos for them
anymore so people have complained about
that company mostly other than any other
company that reviewed premiere lace wig
so I will not be working with them
anymore guys so that's that but these
companies right here these five
companies I can guarantee you guys are
100% legit alright guys so the first
unit I want to talk to you guys about is
one that you guys asked me about a lot
and it's the one that I'm wearing this
hair is from Williams hair company guys
and it is their Malaysian curly hair now
link the information down below for you
guys in regards to this unit and I will
also link the video up here so you guys
can just tag it and click it and go
straight there now this is the hair that
you guys were like oh my god I love it
now I have worn this here for about
three to two weeks guys and I did take
it with me to Thailand and I went to
Thailand for 10 days and I wear this
here about 80% of the time I went in the
water with it I did a lot of activities
with this one does all that kind of
still got into the hair I watch the hair
after the day was over like most of the
time I would if I got into like the
water and watch the hair with like
shampoo and conditioner at the hotel and
at the resort and it's fine this is the
here today guys and I just recently got
back like almost a week ago and this is
what the hair looks like I do not use
products on this hair guys I have not
used any products on it whatsoever the
only thing that I do is call wash it
here and let it air dry overnight and
then just put the wig on my head a dump
Oregon oil in it because I don't have
any and I don't put any like Cantu or
anything like that just because it's
unnecessary so this is exactly the way
that here looks like guys and I
absolutely freaking love it now one
thing I want to say guys about this and
I mentioned this in the last video that
I did with this hair guys I noticed that
the frontal and the bundles matched
perfectly a lot of these Aliexpress
based companies when you're getting like
curly styled units after you co wash the
hair watch the hair after you'll notice
that
you'll notice that the frontal curls
don't match the bundles with this here
and I mentioned in the last video I had
no issues with that the bundle hair and
the frontal hair match perfectly so this
is the first company I can say off of
Aliexpress that I had like perfect
results the hair guys does not tangle
whatsoever I do get a little bit of
shedding when I'm detangling when it
washing but that's normal but just daily
weird doesn't swell up like during the
day and it doesn't kind of get all crazy
and unmanageable this is what it looks
like like right now and even if I went
throughout the day with this one it
would just look the same the next day
this is how great the hair is so I know
you guys asked me about this here a lot
guys I definitely recommend purchasing
this year for Wiggins hair company I do
have some other here coming so to tell
you guys about as well
from Aliexpress so I'm gonna get into
the next one now now the next hair
company that you guys ask me about and
to update you guys about is au Leisha
hair company off of Aliexpress so
basically I've been kind of showing you
guys a lot of these 6:13 ash blonde
custom ash blonde units that I've been
doing now this will probably my last and
final one that I do because I just kind
of done it too heavy but this is the 1i
dark routed and I asked blonde it it's
about 24 inches long guys and it is
super full super nice now the thing
about this hair guys I like it just
because with these bundles these bundles
are actually bodyweight bundles and they
actually hold a lot of body so with this
hair guys I just put a curl in it like
and I do like that kind of loose curl
and I strain it at the end this will
last me about two weeks it does not lose
its style doesn't lose its shape which
is an excellent excellent trait of this
here now the thing about this year that
it's kind of annoying guys it sheds a
lot now all hair sheds guys but I kind
of feel like with 6:13 here because it's
process it does do a little bit more
shedding than usual and I'm not a big
fan of that because a lot of the black
units that I have a lot of like the
colored ombre style units that I have
that are pre colored and sent to me they
don't shed as much as this blonde one
does this blonde one takes the freaking
trophy for shedding this one does tangle
a little bit I don't recommend that you
go ahead and sleep in the unit if you
make a unit if you're someone that does
so ins then you're by yourself with that
one because I don't think that someone
would be appropriate either for here
like this 613 here is very very hard to
manage sometimes even after you process
and stuff like that with this type of
here I would say do like a lot of deep
conditioning just because it's been
through a lot so therefore you kind of
have to you know adapt to its new the
hair has to adapt its new follicle its
new style and 6:13 here has a hard time
doing that so that's one thing I would
say but other than that I do really like
this here guys if you guys know any hair
companies that sell 6:13 here that's a
one let me know down below cuz I'll
probably just purchase some six thirteen
year that's quality quality I know her
hair company does as well too and I
probably should have reviewed the blonde
but I wanted to give the curly air from
her hair company a chance and that here
to guys is legit now that's another hair
company that I honestly can tell you
guys they're curly here and I don't know
about the rest of the hair like your
stringer that's six thirteen year but
the curly hair was a one perfect so like
I said this one I would say if you're
someone that is not really good with
stuff like this or like coloring hair
whatever like that the hair has a lot of
shedding but like I say in all my videos
all hair shed so that's like something
you really can't you know put your hands
up and fight about
so either you seal the weft on this baby
or you just don't buy it but I do like
it because I'm not the type of person to
play around in the hair once the hair
styled like this guys I legitimately
keep it like that and that's that now I
did take this with Italian too and I
wore it I think I wore one night in
Thailand and it did well it was humid it
sparkles like 95 degrees the hair didn't
swell up or anything actually looks
really nice and it was like really
pretty like I thought it was really nice
and if you watched my blog you see the
footage it just looks really nice guys
it didn't swell up but like I said teddy
is a major issue with this here guys so
definitely keep that in mind when
purchasing this 6:13 hear from you
Alicia hair company now the next recent
hair company that I reviewed off of
Aliexpress was from West kiss hair now
this one is a video that you guys
absolutely loved and you
love the color on Instagram and all that
kind of stuff now I wanted to do that
popular Auburn Auburn styled hair color
so this is what the unit looks like and
I am an actual natural light now so you
guys can actually see the colorful
thread but no filter or anything like
that because I know you guys have the
issue with filter and whatever so this
is what the color looks like guys now
this one is let's see what is it it's
three bundles of hair and it's also a
frontal I believe they sent me like some
short lengths like 20 inch 22 inch 20
inch 18 and then like a 16 inch frontal
now with this one I mentioned in the
video to you guys that the hair was
super dry it did come to me natural
color black and I had to bleach the hair
then process it with add or hair dye
Cajun spice and I also use Revlon color
silks light Auburn so I did like this
whole process I'll link that video up
here to all the hair that I tell you
guys about on the video I'll link it up
here so you guys can just go direct to
it so this one guys I did feel like
after processing it was super dry right
now when I look at actually really think
it's really pretty it almost reminds me
of the one I review like a few days ago
but this one is custom made by me and I
actually think that the older it gets
the better it looks I have worn this a
few times and like I said I still feel
that even even since I've boarded a few
times guys which I'm being 100% honest
with I still feel like it's still dry
and maybe I need to go back and deep
condition it for like a baby like an
hour and sometimes I'll even deep
condition for like a day
so I'll maybe have to deep condition
this for a day and then kind of like it
is a natural wave I believe this one is
so therefore all I'm probably gonna have
to do is go in and just leave it like
this or leave it in this natural wave
state I did a wild curl this one I even
think adding a crimp to it would be
pretty so I might even do crimps in this
one next time so I'll come back and show
you guys this
and one of my trying hauls or something
but one thing about this one guys that I
notice it's super dry and I kind of feel
like it's super frizzy as well too in
some spots and like I said I feel like
it's like that because I process it but
I mean it's virgin here well it's not
virgin here if you process it dumb so
you guys know what I mean so
definitely lost some of its glory but I
do think it's it's a nice color what I
say go ahead and process a wave a
texture like this probably not try to do
process it color processes with straight
hair it's easier when you're doing color
processes with curly hair it just kind
of gets crazy because you're already
fighting against the pattern so then
you're also fighting against the color
too so you caused yourself a little bit
mayhem and it's a little bit harder to
get back any color or any bit of life
from the unit so I don't know I think
it's still dry to me I don't really see
any other thing from what I told you
guys in the video before so definitely
just keep that in another company that I
reviewed from Aliexpress and I'll
actually link it up here for you guys
it's from very go hair company now on a
lot of my videos in the beginning of
some of my hair videos you guys will see
me with like a long straight black wig
kind of like long string curls now that
wig guys is from vertical hair company
off of Aliexpress and that is my day one
black wig now that one I did not dye jet
black I just kept that one in this
natural color I absolutely love that
hair guys so it is four bundles of hair
and a frontal and it's 24 inches to 24
inches 122 and a 20 and then I think the
closure is like a 18 or something like
that but I'll link the video up here and
you can go directly to that video that
unit guys is absolutely flawless in the
beginning when I first got the hair and
I made the unit I did not like it
because I felt like it was a little too
flat and it just didn't look good but
after wearing my hair for a little bit
longer and kind of changing the part
around and stuff like that I realized
how much potential that hair has it
curls so nicely it has a great look it's
a great density because I did use all
four bundles and it just looks
absolutely great I always wear that here
guys I will wear that hair forever ever
ever
it's really nice and I kind of feel like
when I custom create these units I kind
of fall in love with them more just
because it's it's custom to me it's
custom to what I like other than that
the hair quality guys is perfect it
sheds just a little bit I don't receive
tangling from it it's easy you can
easily straighten that here you can
easily put curls in it
do any style with it and have no issue I
absolutely rotate that wig like
constantly and you guys always ask me
about that unit so that's the unit where
it is from vertical hair company I use
four bundles in here in a frontal to
make that unit and I have a unit like
months ago and I still have it to this
moment and it is song guys I hope you
guys found this video very informative
and very helpful I will try to do update
videos every month at the end of the
month for you guys so I can kind of give
you guys an overview of all the units
that I reviewed do not forget guys to
thumbs up this video leave your comments

video with your friends and family

later one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
