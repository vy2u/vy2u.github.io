of saturate the hair with water first
I'm only doing this so that the softer
the girls a little bit before I start
detangling honestly I tried not to
detail and go in the here's where I try
to detangle after the product is put in
the hair because once it conditioner
kind of softens the air it'll be easier
beautiful to do it now I do not use
chien-po just because I feel like
shampoo dries a year sometimes so I only
use conditioner and I don't buy
expensive condition or the conditioner
can honestly be from $2 to $5 tops I'm
not studying on the 20 on that because
there are Syrians all the Mucca same job
but I used to swab one and I keratin it
in and it seemed if it's gonna work but
like I said do not try to detangle it
when it's just with no product in it
just because it's going to be harder
you're gonna get a lot of snags and
you're gonna kind of pull some of the
hair out so you just want to make sure
that you I have a conditioner on first
and they detangle it
as you can see this part I've left the
hair in sit for about 20 minutes with a
conditioner in it and now I'm just gonna
ride the comb through it and obviously
it's a little bit softer now so it's
easier for me to detangle you do see
that there's a some Shetty with the
tangling but I like always saying on my
videos all hair sheds so don't expect
that you're gonna buy here that doesn't
shed that's like unrealistic ash so I'm
just do ten million now and then I'll
rinse it out what I do in my hair is I
do not play with it I didn't put any
products in it I didn't put in the argan
oil and nor did I put any of the can to
twist unlock leave-in conditioner just
because I wanted to see what's in here
look like air dried with no products in
it at all and what I'm gonna do is just
hang it up upside down like that and
come back to the next day
alright guys so this is a final result
of the hair once I've Co watched it now
I did not put anything in this hair guys
as far as products so you guys know I
use a can to twist and lock leave-in
conditioner I didn't even use that this
time on this hair once I washed the hair
all I did was let it hang up upside down
I let it air dry this is what the curls
look like when - air dries completely
without any products I didn't put any
oils in there or any curling products or
leave-in conditioners this is a natural
state of the hair once it's air dried
this hair guys is so frickin pretty now
I love the wick product but obviously
the curls look more defined and they're
more kind of like soft and it looks kind
of less but you know what hair looks
like we have a lot of product on its
kind of weighing it down and this hair
looks great without product it does help
when you put a little bit of stuff in it
to kind of like maintain the frizz like
in this ear right here once you start
playing around with it you kind of get a
little like a little bit of frizziness
but what I say for that one is I do like
when the hair has a little bit of
natural frizz just because the natural
frizz that the hair has makes it look
realistic versus it just looking like Oh
her hair's not Frazee's probably either
synthetic or something like that but I
feel like the natural frizz just gives a
hair more of a realistic look now I just
went in guys and I just play with the
baby hairs on the perimeter like I did
in the first video if you haven't
watched that video I'll leave the video
link somewhere up here or down below so
I just went in play with the baby here's
a little bit added some powder I didn't
feel like I need to do a part with this
one just because I
sometimes like to do that kind of flip
over method style thing so I just kind
of just kind of like do like a little
bit of a flip over and didn't do kind of
like a definitive part which I like
better now I did use a keratin
conditioner from suede is this what a
swathe is this swab I think it is but
you guys see in the beginning video so
you guys know and all I did what the
hair was I white at first and then I put
some conditioner all over and I tried to
Duke it detangle into the beginning I
was like you know what you can't really
detangle curly hair without a comb so I
went in and I put the conditioner it
kind of let it soften a little then went
in and detangled it with the comb I did
get shedding but like I always say in
all my videos all hair sheds so there's
really nothing you can do to control
that it's gonna shed
I got minimal shedding with it it wasn't
anything crazy and I showed you guys
exactly how much shedding I got so it
wasn't bad at all it was something
that's just kind of like typical with
hair but when I tell you guys when I put
the conditioner in the hair and then
just detangle de and my detangling
process about like five minutes it
wasn't even like a long detangle process
I actually extended it by going in like
like really intensely trying to get all
the tangles out so I could show you guys
the hair was like butter after like it
was just like sliding through even right
now I don't want to play with it too
much just cuz I love it and it stay
right now but even right now
the hair is super duper soft guys and
like I said there is absolutely no
products in this hair whatsoever it's
super super soft and you guys can see
how to find the curls are it's just it
looks like it's like perfect vacation
here guys and I really really like this
I'm really impressed with this company
guys like curly hair is really hard to
maintain really hard to find from a
great company but this hair from this
hair company I have no complaints this
hair looks really pretty and it holds up
the style hopes up the quality before
wash and after wash though after washing
it just got even better so I highly
recommend checking her hair company out
if you're interested in buying their
bundles so guys I will leave all the
information down below if you're
interested in purchasing this hair I
hope you guys like this video I try to
do something different I never really
show you guys how I maintain my wig so

showing you guys how to maintain some
good curly hair so guys do not forget to
