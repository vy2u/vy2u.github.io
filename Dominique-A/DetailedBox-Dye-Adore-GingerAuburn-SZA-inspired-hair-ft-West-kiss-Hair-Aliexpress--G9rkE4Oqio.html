look of the hair now an issue when I did
this hairstyle guys I was super duper
nervous just because I didn't think it
was gonna come out this cute now I did
go for that nice bright urban look that
coppery looked at everyone's doing it's
really trending it was something big in
the beginning of the winter so I think
it's definitely gonna be something
that's gonna last until the spring and
summer so I wanted to do a wig so I can
keep it and kind of rock it throughout
now this one guys I didn't go dark Roux
to this time just because it's orange I
wanted to kind of get myself like a full
head of color and I think this color was
very good against my skin tone so what I
deal with this guy that showed you that
in the video I video video in the video
I bleached your hair in the beginning I
bleached it once on camera and then
after I went back and bleached it twice
the first time I bleed for about 30
minutes in the six second time I
believed for about 15 minutes I just
wanted to kind of lift the colors up and
I did use the prison lights and with the
prison lights it kind of gives you like
a little bit of level of color so I'll
give you like highlights lowlights
so therefore you'll see like a lot of
dimension and colors in my hair right
now so I do like that about the prison
lights if you want like bleaching
products is gonna give you dimension and
color definitely check them out so I did
the bleaching process first and then I
went in with the hair dye so with the
hair dye guys I used three boxes of
Revlon color silks bright auburn and I
mix cinnamon and Cajun spice and to back
to the contents of those bottles the
bright are burn and kind of made like a
mixture so what you see the colors you
see that I've created is between the
Revlon color silks in a door so I'll
link all the information down below and
in regards to the colors if you want to
try to achieve this color so it was
really hard to try to figure out whether
this was going to come out the right way
with this color in with the bleaching
process if you don't bleach all the
bundles the same you're going to get
different colors so that's one thing to
keep in mind so if you're going to
bleach all the bundles make sure you
bleach a real precise go through it with
the comb and stuff it that and actually
time each bundle you do
so therefore when the final result comes
out you'll actually get the same blonde
on each ones I don't like doing that
because I like to have my wigs have
dimension so I just do the bleach on the
bundles and just waiting for it to
process so that's why in this wig you'll
see like a lot of different kind of
oranges and blondes and stuff like that
especially in the back area you'll see
like a lot of like blonde - dark
brownish kind of Auburn looking here and
the closure itself took the hair dye
very super SuperDuper fast so that's why
I see the front areas very focal and
very bright one thing I'm going to tell
you guys about the processing and house
effect of the hair I definitely here is
super dry the frontal a super dry and it
just is hard to manage so I did have to
go my curl wanna just do that curl lines
throughout not throughout some parts of
the back you'll still see some of the
curl pattern from the loose wave
textured hair but I did curl one a lot
of the front and a lot of the crown area
so therefore it could blend better look
better and I actually do like it like
this it's very the hair super big guys
and it just has more of a body and more
of a look so I definitely like it ten
thousand times better than when you just
let it air dry it was just a mess it was
just it wasn't good I didn't like it at
all
so it definitely practicing wise it
definitely puts a strain on the hair
follicles so definitely beat this hair
to life so I would say if you're gonna
bleach the hair just be careful when
you're bleaching the hair I guess I was
a reckless AF but hey look at the hair
now alright guys so that basically wraps
up today's video I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I hope you guys liked my
hair I'm really feelin this color I
think the vibe is really going it's
really trendy right now and it's
definitely something that I would try if
I were you I feel like the switch up

color and I do have some more color for
