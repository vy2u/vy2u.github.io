today with another hair review
now this hair appeals brought to you
guys as as you can see in the
description bar up here is brought to
you by Diamond virgin hair company and
they contacted me recently to do a hair
view so I was like yeah and this is a
little bit different because it's off
it's not an alley spread space company
so on I know I'm used to doing a lot of
Aliexpress based company so this time
around I'm giving us a video from a
company that is not Aliexpress space
which kind of gives you guys more
variety out there when you're selecting
hair companies to purchase your hair
from so the packaging is pretty bright
but it's pretty nice guys I'm not gonna
lie it's gonna kind of shine reflect off
of the camera so I hope that it doesn't
bother your eyes guys but this is how it
came in the mail and it's pretty it has
like a pink writing that says Diamond
virgin hair company and it's important
undred percent of virgin remy human here
so I was really excited about this
because a lot of youtubers have done
reviews on this hair company and when I
got the offer to do the hair view I was
really excited um they are said to have
like really amazing hair and I've heard
nothing but good things about this hair
company so I wanted to really try it out
for myself
and give you guys kind of like a
different kind of like sense of hair
company spoiling period I'm Alyssa I'm
linked onto this hair and the hair
company itself you can check it out the
prices are vary in price um it is not
alice most based type of prices so
therefore you will be paying more money
but I'm pretty sure you be paying more
money for quality products so um yeah so
keep that in mind
I did get send for bundles of hair and a
closure and I'm gonna open right now to
show you guys what I got I got uh lets
us you with me so I got four bundles of
hair and I got it closed I don't show
you guys the plastic you know cuz they
do actually really take their time to
actually make each thing labels I got
four photos a 22 inch and all the labels
came with a 22 inch on it and they did
come with this signature
little Pat sealant which says diamond
virgin hair company and each bundle came
in two separate packaging I will show
you guys what the bundles look like
first just to start off so like I said
I've got four bundles of the mink
Brazilian straight hair and these are
the four bundles together and this is
how much you get a 22 inch bundle
getting longer hair you're probably not
gonna have that much more here than
what's in this so keep in mind that the
longer length you get the less hair you
get but all the hair is true to length
this is 22 inches all bundles match up
and even at the end of the bundles
actually cut that hair straight at the
end which I like because it just kind of
gives you like just a defined line and
it's just that's the length and on each
bundle they actually has a diamond
virgin hair logo on it as well I think
that's really cool that they tryna they
really really love their company that
much I think this far um but yeah so
this is four bundles so I feel like I
always do the ponytail test with this if
this is gonna be like a thick thick
ponytail then you know that this is
enough hair but keep in mind I make my
wigs on dumb caps so therefore um I'm
going to use a closure obviously in the
closure I will show you guys the culture
is I think it's about a 3 by 4 or 4 by 4
closure I'm not sure I will actually
link the information down below the
direct link and everything to the hair
down below for you guys just because I
don't want to say anything crazy and
then you guys look at me crazy so yeah
so this is the closure and I love how it
has a border on it so that it doesn't
tear that really helps the hair
supportively because you know if you're
like really the type of business
stretches this out and stuff like that
using elastic band you don't really want
this to tear and it's very the
reinforcement is very well done on here
and the closure is a 14 inch I think
this is the longest of closures that the
company goes to and it's a very nice
closure you guys can see it's the thing
I like about the hair is the hair is
thick from root to tip you're not gonna
find thinness at the ends of the hair my
hair is thick all the way through and
that's one good thing it does come with
baby hairs and the baby hairs on here
very very nice baby hairs which I really
appreciate they're not like kind of like
thin baby hairs without character these
baby hairs are very very nice and they
actually come out of the closure and are
really prominent the hair closure is not
too thick I'm gonna bleach it so I can
get some definition in it so when I'm
parting in here I have a realistic look
so that is one of something I'm really
gonna do but I'm gonna bleach this and
I'm going to install it on a dump cap
with the bundles so this time for this
hairstyle to do something different in
my last last two two to three videos I
did on Ali Mota
um malaysian loose wave here in the
beginning of the video i had a certain
color hair that everyone was asking me
about and I have a wig that is kind of
like I made into like a layered look and
it's a red color and it's kind of like a
burgundy magenta color so I want to
reenact that hair color with this hair
but what I'm going to do is it's gonna
be kind of the same concept if you check
that video but it's just gonna be longer
and luxurious and I wanted to use some
good virgin hair which this is good
virgin here to do this hair review to do
this color with so the color I'm going
to use for the hair color is the L'Oreal
techniques new chroma true red hair dye
and I just went to Sally's today pick
this up and I was just I'd like to test
things out and I do I do love the
L'Oreal techniques hi color one so this
one was kind of like a subcategory for
this one is a little bit more expensive
I'm not gonna lie but the color payoff
when I was looking at the things is very
very nice friends so this is what it
looks like guys and they saw at Sally's
hopefully my camera is focusing and this
color right here is the color Garnett
and I got three packs of this one and a
forty bottom developer I know some of
you guys are looking at me like now
right now like why did this bitch just
get only three three little boxes of
these doll means oh my god three boxes
of these is because I'm using 40 volume
developer and I'm gonna saturate the
hair I don't really want to here to
catch a permanent permanent like bright
red look I just want to saturate the
hair enough so that I can pick up the
color and that it's like a red color but
it's not - it's not - Wow in your faith
checker right so um even if it doesn't
come up if it does come out while your
face wet I feel like it would look
really nice against my skin complexion
so that's the look I'm gonna go for and
like I said I've got three boxes and I'm
gonna mix these three boxes with 45
developer and I just use the salon care
of 41 developer to achieve that
beautiful red look for the springtime so
this will be
so I'm back and this is what the hair
looks like after I have color the hair
and after I've installed the hair on a
dome cap with elastic band and all that
kind of stuff so this is the diamond
virgin hair companies a mink Brazilian
straight hair I have four bundles of
hair and in the closure and I did use
every single bit of the hair that was
sent to me I do not have a strip club I
do not have a strand lamp I use every
single bit of the hair and the hair is
extremely extremely full guys I will try
to show you guys what the hair looks
like to begin I do called the hair off
and the hair is straight but you
probably see a couple of like little
dents or Kingstown in the back but okay
but the hair is very nice guys you guys
can see like kind of like the shake and
the wave of the hair it does hold a very
good curl I did test it by curling it
just to make sure that the hair was
completely what it said it was going to
be
I just basically were been wearing it
like this for now it is on it is a wig
so therefore I just take it off at
nighttime and put it back on in the
morning when I'm ready to go so I
haven't really slept in it to tell you
guys how it does if it matched up but it
doesn't tangle it does shed though and
the shedding that I'm receiving from the
hair is not long strands shedding it's
more of like clip shedding I didn't
bleach the hair when I colored it so
therefore I don't know if you know that
box that I used was a high processor
it was meant for dark hair so therefore
it was a red dye for dark hair so
therefore I didn't have to bleach air
anything to get the color you guys
probably won't see the color too much in
this way but if I go outside or I'm like
in a like bright setting like maybe like
in the springtime or summertime the
color does come off really really nice
and vibrant if I do turn on the side you
can see some shades of it in towards the
back of the bundles which is pretty much
explains what it looks like I did tweeze
in part the closure I am gonna keep this
as a middle part unit just because I
just want to do a middle part unit but
sometimes I'm able to swap it over to
the side to do a side part but for this
one because it's a sleek straight hair
style I'm probably just going to keep in
the middle part and then go and do some
layers in it just so that when I curl it
it kind of curls and folds in like a
layered effect so that it's just not all
kind of like one leg one way
I'm gonna probably do that too just to
kind of give it a better like visual
look but the closure is very good guys I
did actually bleach the cold riff I
didn't mention in the beginning video I
did
please took hold closure for um just
kind of kind of make it look a little
bit more realistic and obviously I added
concealer on it so the concealers give
it more of a realistic vibe the closures
of fourteen and so you get it to come
about right here which is not too bad
because it does have kind of like the
jagged layered effect which I do like
with closures I don't really like
closure that like our past 16 inches
went along here because I kind of feel
like it looks kind of funny and I do
want to kind of give myself like a
little bit of a face kind of like frame
were in the front so I thought that was
really nice
all bundles are very full they're full
from root to tip which I really like it
does have a really beautiful luster you
don't really have to add stuff wanted to
make it look shiny because it just has a
nice shiny effect anyways which I like
as well other than that guys the only
thing I see that the problem is that the
hair is a shedding part like I said it's
not full strength shedding it's kind of
like clippings of shedding I don't know
if it's because I dye the hair naturally
without like bleaching it or whatever
but maybe that's something to kind of
think about but it is really nice guys
to get a lot of compliments and it just
looks really really flawless I don't
know if my wig application or something
was good but it lays very nice and flat
and it looks very very very very
attractive guys like it's like a nice
hairstyle and because it's straight I'm
probably just gonna leave it in the
middle part look just because it will
look more nice and this is definitely an
ear style you could wear in the
springtime in the summer time if you're
trying to go just for like that sleek
edgy look so I'm definitely gonna be
rocking this in the summertime so that
basically wraps up with my video guys I
don't want to keep talking and talking
and talking and talking cuz this videos
already long as it is I hope you guys
find that this video was informative I
try to add clips in here just to show
