I'm recording this video so I'm
completely bare face so what we're gonna
do today guys is review the ghost bond
so this is gonna be a start to finish
video because I have an amazing
hairstyle that I want to do with this
unit so this unit guys is from RPG here
calm so this is the lace front unit guys
it's about 18 to 20 inches long and it
is a yaki textured unit so what I'm
trying to do with this unit guys is do
like a different style I'm not gonna
mention it now you guys will have to
wait till the end of the video to see
the final look and you probably already
saw it in the picture so you know what
that looks gonna look like so I'm
reviewing the ghost botton today you
guys have asked me to review the Ghost
fun so I decided to purchase it off
Amazon I got this one off of Amazon for
about 21 dollars and 50 cent and I
didn't like two days off prime I will
link it down below if you're interested
in buying the Ghost bond honestly feel
like 21 dollars for Ghost fun it's
pretty expensive I'm like true I love
got to be glue I find got to be glue to
be really good it's inexpensive and you
can't go wrong with that now this is my
first time trying this so I'm a little
bit nervous it does look like this like
what are those white consistency oh it
is it's like a creamy white consistency
so I'm a little nervous that this kind
of give me some issues but it's what
consistency consistency just like - got
to be glue but this one is a little bit
thicker now on the bottle it does say
that it's an invisible bonding for poly
&amp;amp; Lace systems it's specially formulated
for oily scalps high high humidity and
heavy preparation this guys if this
works I recommend I mean like if this
really comes out and works really good
and definitely is good for humidity and
stuff this is probably something I would
recommend wearing using for wigs in like
hot humid weather like if your long
vacation this summer or just in general
I like got to be goo cos got to be glues
really easy to take off so I'm wondering
how this is gonna turn out guys so if
you guys want me to do a video on how to
take the unit off after with this just
let me know down below so let's just get
right into the video
alright so I don't really know how to
start with this so I'm just gonna do
like I do the got to be blue so I'm
gonna put the product on the back of my
hand and then we're gonna do layers now
this is definitely thicker than got to
be glue and it's kind of like a white
cast
I hope this dries clear so I
just gonna put like nice thin layers
around this edges now this wig does have
a little bit of lace in the back so I'm
gonna turn around and show you guys how
I glue the back down this is a lace
front wig guys it is not a full lace wig
so it does have a section in the back
where you can actually go ahead in and
glue it down to make like high ponytail
styles so for the purpose of this video
I'm going to actually go in and do that
so that you guys can see what this wig
looks like in a ponytail I guess if you
want to wear your hearing your wigs and
ponytails but these companies certain
companies I've told you I've mentioned
in my videos before have wigs that have
like this nice extra piece of lace in
the back and it's a thick enough piece
that you can actually glue down and
create like really nice like a a nice
back and then you can actually do like
nice high up styles without having like
you know gaping spaces in the back and
stuff like that wow this actually dries
really fast like it's actually really
like really sticky right now oh my gosh
I'm actually afraid that my um my hair
my little bit of edges I got are gonna
get like snapped on this because it's
super duper tacky so I'm just gonna
cover those up with my um my stocking
cap because I'm afraid that I'm gonna
lose whatever a little bit of here is I
got so I played that one layer is a quo
it's super super strong guys wow it's
like super super uh like tacky I'm I'm
gonna put on the back of my hand I'm
just gonna put it on with the thing I
should probably go on and get like a
little brush so I can apply my um
adhesives I'm a little afraid that this
is not gonna come off the way I think
it's gonna come off but um it's
SuperDuper quick dry so it dries pretty
quick so I would say work fast and make
sure you aim that that make sure you
like kind of aim at the spots that you
should so definitely work fast at this
product because it dries fast and it's
definitely really sticky but now I'm
looking at it it definitely dries clear
so you don't really have to worry about
it not drying clear so I'm just gonna
apply this and then I think I'm just
gonna plop the hair down because I feel
like it's so dry already that I don't
want it to be too dry and that it's not
tacky enough for me to put the wig down
so I'm just gonna like fan it a little
bit it's already kind of clearing off on
some size especially this side right
hand well it drives yo
this Giants clear faster than got to be
blue got to be glue takes forever to dry
and then you always have like that white
app overcast but I'm not gonna play got
to be good because I love them and I
always use got to be glue so we're just
gonna dry this bad boy out and like I
said is super look at that it's super
tacky it's ridiculous so what I'm gonna
do is just position this in the right
position so this is ear to ear right
here and I told you guys sometimes I'll
pull it in the position so that I know
that the ear to ear tab is going to land
right so this is where should land and
this is where should land and it's not
like the ear tabs aren't like overly
large I hate big ear tabs I just ruined
everything so um it's pretty clear Oh
God look how clear that is it's already
super clear so I'm going to just pull
this down Wow oh wow you know it I feel
like I just got a facelift I really feel
like I just got an entire facelift right
now like this dried so fast and it's
super secure guys like it's wow wow it's
like no for real not like no lies bro
this is like super duper tight insecure
Wow okay
okay I'm a little I'm a little taken
aback I'm not gonna lie okay like look
do you guys see that oh so you know
I'm ready to go back so I'm gonna go
back and just fix a little bit of this
wow like guys I feel like I'm having I
just got a facelift like it's super
tight and secured down I'm not even good
I'm not even worried about this lifting
at all it's like super tight so what I'm
gonna do is just go in and put some glue
on the imperfection spots the spots I
didn't kind of get and then I'll come
back and
so I'm basically done drying I actually
put the headscarf on for about like five
ten minutes just to make sure that it
was actually skate it
so the wig is SuperDuper tight like I
like it is super tight you cannot pull
this awfully now I'm gonna say this in
regards to this product now if you're
someone that wants to wear the hair for
a little bit longer than four days or
three days I got to be good usually does
for me I wear got to be glue for about
three to five days sometimes this one
actually I feel like this one can last
like a week this is SuperDuper tight
guys like it's SuperDuper tight so what
I'm gonna do now guys is I'm going to go
ahead and and customize a hair line by
tweezing the hair in the front the back
actually is pretty flat as well to it
lay down in the back pretty well I'm
sure I'm really shocked guys this is
like really really like strong glue and
I just want to mention do not do what I
did and use your fingers with this one
it is all over my hands it's super duper
tacky I'm gonna have to wash my hands
like really hard like use a lot of
friction to get this glue off my hands
but so far I think it's a good adhesive
guys it's really sticky like I didn't
like and then one thing I want to
mention it doesn't have the residual
there's no like cast-off from like the
glue like we've got to be glue you get
flaky I don't get flakes with this one
at all at all no flakes no fix eyes so
this is one thing this one is not flaky
another thing it is it is white when you
apply it but it does clear it dries
clear and the gossipy glue doesn't do
that either it doesn't dry as clear as
you would like so this one does it dries
clear within like a minute so you're
really gonna have like a really clean
install with this one so what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to customize the
hairline and then I'm gonna come back to
you guys but obviously I'm gonna fast
forward that part you guys like to see
that part because obviously this is a
start to finish so that bar has to be
included so let's move along
alright friends so it is day 3 and I'm
coming back to give you guys a final
review of this ghost bond now the ghost
bond process for me this time was fun I
do still really really enjoy got to be
glue more than this product and I'm
going to be completely honest with you
guys
first of all price wise the ghost bond
is just like three times the price of
got to be glue I can get got to be glue
for about five dollars at Walmart and
the ghost bond was twenty-one dollars
off of Amazon if you have a better price
just leave your comment down below now
the second thing I didn't comparable for
those products because I'm just in love
with got to be glue got to be glue
actually stays down a little bit better
than the ghost bond like with this one I
was still seeing like a little bit
lifting after day one day two I was
getting like a little bit of the air
tablet but you know that's common with
all kinds of ways you wear with all
kinds of adhesives the air tabs never
really stick that well but with this one
I noticed that but the ghost one is that
any drop of water or liquid or whatever
the thing is detaching from the from the
head so with got to be glue I don't
really have that issue I can wash my
face fully wash my face and then like go
to bed and wake up the next day after I
put my headscarf down and my wig is like
still glued to my head with this product
I was trying to slip down my bun and I
kind of like wet the hair so I can kind
of get a real slick as soon as I wet my
hair I noticed that the wig was already
lifting and I'm like what the heck now
ghost one says on the bottle that it
works for kind of like people who are
perspire a lot or like humid weather
when it's really hot and I'm thinking to
myself oh this is gonna be great for
like one of those tropical vacations and
you want to wear your wigs and you want
to glue them down but that didn't really
work out the way I thought it was
because as soon as I sprayed water
around my perimeter the wig already was
starting to lift up so I was so confused
about that but like I said it is an
expensive product it works for a lot of
people one great thing about this
product though it dries very clear so
it's not going to give you a residual I
had no residual at all with this unit
with this glue and on the unit so I had
none of that kind of stuff and it was
really sticky so it almost gave me a
facelift when I planted it down
just kind of cool so it was like really
really tight and it curated right on my
forehead and it was just perfect so
those are things that I did like I'm not
sure if I wasn't applying it the way I
should have applied it but I did the
best way I thought was I did the best I
could thinking that it was similar to
got to be glue adding some nice thin
layers on it and then letting it dry
this one dries very fast guys and dries
very clear so you really have to work
hard and fast with this one I do
recommend that you use like a small like
makeup brush to apply this on your your
head because it is very sticky and if
it's very dirty and gets like really
like all over the place so definitely
use like a small brush to apply this if
you're going to purchase this product so
guys I will leave the website down below
where I got I got a foot Amazon solely
the direct store length if you guys want
to purchase it from Amazon like I said
go swag works it I just feel like it
just doesn't do what the bottle says if
I can just drop a little bit of water on
it and it's already lifting I just come
back if you go into the water and like
the whole entire work is gonna come off
but I don't anyone's going to do that
but I think it you know for something
else trying something else on my channel
I thought it was cool if I had an event
to go till I was I needed to do it
really quick and put the wig down quick
and make sure that it stayed I would use
this because this one dries very fast it
dries clear and you won't see anything
like I did whatever I could to it to
make it look as good as possible I feel
like it actually looks very nice and
natural you don't see any residual
crustiness or flakiness on its own
that's a good thing and like I said I
did glue the back down and I did show
you guys what the back look like in the
beginning when I was going it down so I
hope that was helpful for some people
who want to know how to go their backs
down on their units now this unit by the
way came with a great piece in the back
that you can glue unit units down with
which is a piece that I always tell you
guys it's like a nice big piece of lace
so therefore you put a nice amount of
glue on the back and the wind just lays
very flat so I did show you guys how I
did that because I thought that part of
the video but very important for those
who want to know how to glue their wings
in the back so I thought that actually
came out good guys I do like the ending
result I just trying to wear this wig
and kind of like buns and styles one
thing about this unit though guys they
need to add more hair in the back to
cover some of the cap because I did
turnaround at one point oh
wait I can see my cap so I had to go in
and kind of readjust things around so I
can kind of cover the scalp the cat so
that's not obvious to the world that hey
she's wearing a wig but other than that
I do like this unit I think it came out
really good
it is a Yaqui texture unit and you guys
know I love RPG here's yaki unit so this
is very nice guys and I think it looks
realistic enough to be mines so guys I
will leave all the information down
below if you're interested in purchasing
the book go spawn and if you're
interested in purchasing this unit from
RPG here calm guys do not forget to
thumbs up this video leave your comments
down below subscribe and share this
video with your friends and family
people and I will catch you guys in a
later one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
