gonna be a top 3 video on how I do my
foundation I will be using a drugstore
foundation in the foundation I will be
using today is the maybelline superstay
better skin foundation and I really love
my drugstore foundation and recently
this has been my favorite foundation to
use so I'm going to feature this in this
video so I could show you guys and talk
through with you guys how I apply my
foundation and actually finish my face I
have done my eyebrows already and I did
my eyes with just some basic lashes just
to be natural today well as that as
possible but yeah so what I'm gonna
start off as an X to do perfect 411
primer it's an oil-based primer I do use
it pretty much every single day when I
add when I profound ation well from not
doing foundation that is good as a
primer or like a moisturizer
anyways and you can see I have a lot of
dark imperfections on my face right here
in these corners I thought you could see
them more when I'm looking at my mirror
but when I look in the camera you can't
really see that much but I see it so it
really bothers me what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna use the Mac Pro concealer qua
no quad it's a six piece palette and it
comes in these colors and this is a
colored dark I'm just gonna use a little
bit of the color corrector the orange
color corrector just to put it on some
spots I see I'm really dark in this ear
right here so I just try to put it in
the mustache area and a little bit right
here turn it in the t-zone area in here
so she does have some imperfections in
that area as well there's some spots
right here so I'm just gonna put this on
these sides right here just to kind of
give it a little bit more coverage
whenever the foundation on alright so
like if you guys know the super state
foundation it is very very warranty
tinge so that's one day I'm going to be
wearing with with this foundation you
have to be careful when you're up on
this foundation I'm just gonna use the
elf foundation brush it's very small I
like it because it does a good
application when the two squirts on the
brush and I'm just gonna try to blend
this in the best I can so yeah and this
foundation is like eight dollars that's
why I got out one more for eight dollars
you can get it at Target
Walmart's probably the cheapest if you
have coupons go to CVS but I didn't have
cope on some ticket to good old Walmart
and Walmart there have really good
prices so I really really like Walmart
when it comes to drugstore foundations
they have the best price on Foundations
even the Revlon that even the Maybelline
fit me foundation is like 5060 cents
there like where are you gonna get that
for five dollars that like that's like
the best price ever for a foundation and
I usually get it from them and it's
really really good so I'm just gonna
keep applying the foundation on my face
and yeah so we went into two more pumps
on the other side like I said this has
like an orange tangerine you guys can
see it's a really orange base so um it
does come off looking like you look
really orange with this on but once you
set the foundation and you know created
your beautiful highlight and stuff like
that the foundation tends to come a
little bit better my parents and it is
really oily so you they have to get in
there with the foundation and I just
like wash my hair this morning and so
just gonna it's looking kind of like
Baldy ugly and looking kind of Baldy
Ozzy right now so yeah so this is the
first time done we'll talk to video guys
leave comments down below in time what
you think about the top the video you
guys always asked me to do this because
I never like I never did talking videos
or just to like fast forwarded videos
with me apply my foundation I know it's
kind of annoying because you don't
really get to hear the aspects of me
talking to you guys well have the right
foundation I just quickly do it and then
put it on a video and have you guys
watch me do it um I'm not I don't
consider my considered makeup artist I
don't consider myself a makeup Kondos or
or makeup whatever I just do makeup for
fun so therefore I don't want to make my
channel about makeup and a lot of stuff
like that but it is something that I'd
like to do and I do it I consider pretty
well so I don't mind making videos for
you guys on my foundation and stuff like
that so I'm going to use now as just a
highlight and I'm gonna use toffee from
pro conceal and we're just gonna do a
regular all highlight underneath my eyes
I actually set my face after I highlight
just because it'll all be perfect
together so I just do that after I know
my steps are very different so like I
said I'm not super a professional makeup
artist I'm not an MEA or whatever you
guys want to call it so I'm just doing
this just from what I learned and how I
do my makeup it works for me so I hope
you guys think that it's interesting I
have to do this in every video so you
guys know how I could seal I just use
the end of this Beauty Blender and I
just highlight really well I make sure I
like indented in the eye part so that I
have like a beautiful highlight oh yeah
and yeah so I tried to get it really
good and then you can see like the
foundation coming through right now what
I'm gonna do after I let this sit for a
couple seconds I'm gonna add a little
bit of a cream contour in this just so I
can get like a more defined face I have
kind of like a natural contour on my
face right here on my cheeks just cuz um
I think it only appears when I have
short hair when I have a long hair it's
kind of distracted by the long hair so
um yeah I'm gonna just run that
concealer down to my um my mustache
right here so yeah just gonna blend away
and if this video is kind of long sorry
guys
I've been wanting to do a Q&amp;amp;A video so
you guys can get to know me I've been
getting a lot of subscribers at least so
it's kind of like I want to kind of get
your like you know feel me who I am
stuff like that so I am going to do in
Q&amp;amp;A video or I'm just gonna do a 25 tag
a 25 questions or facts about me video
that would be interesting if you guys
get to know a little bit more about me
this summer I'm planning to do a lot of
stuff like so I wanted to kind of get
you guys into the groove of me so yeah
so I'm gonna go back into that quad that
quad why do I keep hauling the
 of quad
what is this quite we're just gonna
record it we're just gonna ignore guys
so I'm gonna get into the dark part
right here and I'm gonna just use this
little brush that I got from wholesale
buyers wholesale buying calm and we're
just gonna get a little bit the brown
one in everybody is a cream concealer on
face just to kind of give me a little
contour and I use the same beauty
blender for most of the stuff that I do
just because it already has a good
foundation on it so there's no point of
me you know trying to use other stuff so
I'm gonna get my major forehead up here
once I finish doing my hair and once my
hair starts trying on the top it's gonna
be all pretty when I have like a nice
contour cuz my forehead is really really
large so I tried to contour it with my
short hair and if I don't contour oh wow
I mean like it still looks good so I
really don't care and you guys aren't
used to seeing me with like such a large
forehead because my frickin wigs be
having me looking like I ain't got a big
forehead but I really do so inside of
this in so now I'm just gonna go in and
just kind of blend it in just try to
make it look a little bit more realistic
but I actually like this color umm
contour it's really nice against my skin
and I'm gonna add a setter on it so you
guys can see in the center that I'm
going to use I will show you guys
shortly it really makes your contour
look absolutely great so I'm just gonna
add some of the lighter toffee on the
bottom from the end of the other end
where I used to do my concealer just to
kind of define the contour okay and this
will give you that definition and I just
kind of melted the rest of it and so
that can look really good okay
so I'm gonna come back mmm that's
obnoxious stuff in here just show you
guys so I'm gonna set the phone set the
concealer set the face so what I'm gonna
do now is that and I usually mix powders
together so I'll list some somewhere in
the video so you guys can see or it'll
be in the description bar I'm just gonna
use a small angle um sponge and I'm
gonna press this powder into it and this
is just like a highlight powder this is
what gives you that like perfect like
looking glow and you know I gotta have
that absolute glow um you're just
breathtaking you know I mean me okay so
what I'm gonna use to kind of balance
out this contour that I do cream contour
is the covergirl Queen collection at
be bronzed now if you do not have this
bronzer I don't know what to tell you
because this bronzer is everything it is
everything so I'm going to use it the BH
Cosmetics is just a regular old powder
brush I'm just gonna use a little bit of
this and I'm going to kind of cover up
or kind of like trace over the contour
that I did before to give my face and
definition and then I'm just gonna come
down here and do a little bit of it here
just to kind of make it more defined and
girl oh my god it's so nice and you can
see how define it it's gonna get now
this is what I do usually just to define
my face just to make it look more you
know so then what I'm gonna do is just
take one of those old elf I'm kind of I
think it's a blush blush or whatever or
just pop the damn thing off and I'm just
gonna wipe this off and I think it's
easy look at that highlight guys it
looks so pretty good I'm just gonna run
it over the for hair from the mustache
area as well just to make sure that I
have gotten it so one thing I'm gonna
add this not a drugstore product but as
well it's not really yeah it's not a
drugstore product this is the nurse
pressed powder and I really like this
pressed powder because it kind of
balances off the foundation a lot and I
use this all over my face and it was
really good it's a little on the pricey
side but hey whatever so I'm just gonna
do that underneath the contour a little
bit above the contour too as well
when this depth it makes it look a
little bit orange but um once I've said
it then everything is done it'll look
really great so I'm gonna use you know
the good old prep and prime from Mac and
just spray my face I can get
and I usually like doing this so I could
let it sit and be all nice
my eyebrows are kind of getting a little
messed up but whatever so the last thing
I do to get like a really natural face
of thin lips my lips is chap right now
the last thing I'm gonna use is the miss
Yulan palette and you know I'm like this
is just way too good and I'm going to
use the highlights or the missing limb
palette just because they are just
absolutely everything so I'm gonna use
the one that I've dug into which is that
pink tone one all the way at the end
right here and this one really gives you
a good highlight guys so like it's just
like wait a minute oh wow so it really
does give you a good highlight
I do like to run somewhere on the bridge
of my nose and I might keep it slow so
yes
and that's highlight magnificent so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video this
basic conclusive video and I did add
some extra like underneath eyeliner a
little tear duct and my lips and for my
lips I did use mahogany from NYX slim
pencils lip pencils so that's about it
guys I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I will catch you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
