today with a hairstyling tutorial now
today's here selling tutorials going to
be on how I deep wave or crimp my hair
I've been asked a lot of questions
lately on how I get like the deep wave
pattern in some of my units so I decided
to come today and show you guys how I
get that book so I'm going to use three
products and the actual crimper itself
to get my hair to be nice and styled the
first thing I'm going to use is the
protectant spray and I use a Garnier
Fructis tile flatiron protector
Perfector and it's a straining mist it's
just a basic key protectant spray it is
meant for straight hair too sleek in it
but I use it as he protected from my
units all the time even if I'm going to
curl it or just do a crimps or whatever
I just need something to keep the hair
from burning so the next thing I'm going
to use is the Aussie awesome volume hair
spray and it's a finishing spray it is
maximum holds and it's like in this big
big big thing I usually get to sell one
more for like three bucks it's really
inexpensive this works very well it
holds your curls and your Styles really
really well so I use this for everything
even my flyaways at the top of my head i
use this and i put my curling iron down
on it to keep it nice and in place so
this off you have some really good
hairspray products that you guys should
really look into I really like it so the
next thing I'm going to use is a
technique aren't wild styles next day
here and this has been just one of my go
to products that I've discovered lately
and it's just really good for synthetic
unit straight units and it's just it
just works really well when you try to
get that next day here or let giving the
hair like texture of volume or giving
like this kind of natural look I really
really like this part of the eye and I
do recognize and I do recommend this to
anyone if you're looking for something
to give your hair little more texture
and oh this is it no linked on the
website where I got this and I got this
from Ulta so last but not least would be
the product itself so this is my deep
waver this is really old guys I got this
about three years ago
and I got this from I think it was
Sally's that I purchased this from I'm
pretty sure Sally still sells this if
they don't sell in the store you might
want to check online because online they
usually have like a thousand things
online so I would check out online if
you're looking for this product Walmart
to sell out as well and Harmons
beauty store sells it as well too so
try them this is the hotshot tools
crimper or a deep waver I call it crimp
cuz it kinda it's kind of crimp in a
deep wave so that's not just whatever
whatever you preference of calling it I
call it crimps so I crimp my hair this
is my crimper or my deep waver i deep
wave my hair that's my deep flavor that
of that so this is the product guys it
does have settings up to four hundred
and thirty degrees so I was put on four
thirty
it just gets the job done faster and
quicker and you can actually get nice
results I will show you guys how I go
down and do the crimps
you know piece by piece to show you guys
how I get it depending on how long your
hair is you're probably going longer and
longer and longer but this unit is only
like twenty two inches so it's not going
to be that long to do this so if you're
interested in seeing how I get my hair
nice and deep wait I want you to stay
