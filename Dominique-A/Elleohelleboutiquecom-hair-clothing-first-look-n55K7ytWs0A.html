today and I'm stopping by today to do a
quick review for a company and this
company's name is called lol boutique
and they contacted me through my youtube
channel and asked me if I wanted to
review a couple of packs from their
company and I gladly agreed guys they
sent me two clothing items and they sent
me three bundles of hair and one closure
so um I was able to pick whatever I want
on the website so I did go for the hair
and the two items of clothes most of the
clothing that they had we've had a sold
out at the moment they saw items very
fast so therefore it was sold out
obviously there was a lot of other
things on there that I really wanted to
get but I didn't have the chance to get
so I picked some things that I thought
were cute and that was it sold out so
these are items that I can actually wear
and rock and make it look real cool so
I'm gonna start off by show you guys the
items the clothing items that I got to
start off I went to I actually went to
the most of the clothes in the junior
section where it kind of sold out so I
went to the plus-size section and they
had one XL so I decided to pick up this
really cool kind of throw over when it
kind of like sweater item I don't know
how you guys explain this one I forgot
that I don't even know the name I will
post on the name that they put for the
item on down below so you guys know
exactly what the name of the shirt
design is but it's kind of like a
oversized kind of like throw over I want
to call it has this really nice leather
panel on the front of it and the reason
why I like this Alai is because I'm kind
of like leather is like really sexy and
cool for the summer for the wintertime
so I thought it would look nice with
some of my liquid leggings or anything
like that you could just spice it up
with some booties or something like that
it's really nice it's pretty long so it
covers your backside if some of you
girls don't like to show your rear-end
out and stuff like that it comes down
pretty far so that all your your whole
entire body is not exposed to the world
so this I really like this one is very
soft and um it's a really nice product
it doesn't get linked here or anything
like that which I like because a lot of
black holes tend to get linty and so far
this hasn't gone into yet but I haven't
really worn this out yet so we'll see
probably weird tomorrow but I like this
like the way it's built the structure
the construction is very nice and it's a
very simple way to make
outfit look a little bit better you know
I'm saying throwing this on can actually
make the aisle go from zero to ten so
this is really nice and I picked this
one up and that guys thought this isn't
a size extra large and this was in the
plus-size area for the actual website um
the next piece that I got and like I
said I only got two pieces and of course
I got another black item because I like
black I know a lot of girls like her I
could agree with me black is like the
easiest thing to wear
I'm not body conscious or anything I
just black I just think black goes with
everything so I just black it up or I
wear colors most of the time like a
beanie cap is like frickin rainbow
colors but I don't make it fun sometimes
but usually sometimes it's black or
whatever you know like just quick
whatever so this is like a Tunica and
it's like really pretty um I like this
one a lot it's like you can either wear
like a half shoulder and stuff like that
put a really nice necklace on it and
make it look pretty it is kind of a
thing is quarter length sleeve which is
nice and it's pretty nice and long and
lengthy so it's a really nice and soft
and it's I believe this is like cotton
so it's like really warm and this will
keep you warm you know put I can light
the nice long tank top underneath it and
then just wear like that wear it off the
shoulder and there you go so this is
what this one looks like it's pretty I
love it and it's just plain but like I
said putting a necklace on it can make a
go from zero to ten so this is really
nice um so that's all I got for the
clothing but we're gonna get into the
hair because I know you guys want to
know what the hair is um the hair that I
received I received well I received I
chose hair that I wanted to choose for
the wintertime and the hair that I
decided to pick is the Brazilian body
wave here I actually got three bundles
of hair I got a 20 inch 22 inch and a 24
inch and it came like this it actually
came in a plastic bag like any regular
plastic bag from a company and this is
the Brazilian body wave hair and I did
told you guys in my last video I was
getting extra long links they're not
extra extra long links it's a little
exaggerated it's like 24 inches but to
some people 24 inches is exaggerated so
I said it's like exaggerating 20 it's 24
inches 22 inches and
chuckles and they hair it's a freaking
soft it's so nice and pretty um when you
gots until the 24 inch pretty much comes
like down to my belly button and this is
the 24 inch into the 22 you can see the
lengths or variations right there and
like I said the longest one that comes
like way past my breasts and the hair
bundle eyes this is what the bundles
look like and obviously the longer
lengths here you get the less hair you
get in the bundle which is okay and the
shorter leg to get more hearing which is
fine but it kind of looks like they're
actually equal which is really cool um
but this is it and I will be installing
this hair soon so I'm very excited about
this it smells awesome
no tangling no shedding it's amazing
eyes so this is what the hair looks like
and it's the Virgin Brazilian body wave
here and I don't think I'm gonna die
this hair at all I think I'm just gonna
wear this for the winter time just as
his natural color just just for the
winter um and I also got a closer like I
said and this is a 16 inch closure the
bundles are repeated again was 20 inch
22 inch to 24 inch and this is a 16 inch
closure they do put a barrier on the
edge of the closure so it's very secure
and very nice which is very good because
it won't rip let me take it out the next
I can show you guys exactly what the
hell you are getting yourself into
um it's very nice guy as a body wave
texture is so pretty it matches the hair
to a tee and you got some nice parting
space in there I might have to tweeze it
a little bit which is fine with me
you also get some really good baby hairs
at the front of the closure and I love
my baby ears so altogether this should
be a good head solid head of here so
this is what you get this is what I
actually got
um and that's about it guys um I want to
tell you guys to check out the website
and like I said before their website is
called lol boutique I will list all the
information down below guys every single
thing you need to know about the company
