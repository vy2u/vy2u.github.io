with another wig review now today's look
of you is brought to you got some all
tray now this wig is styled Dominique
and it is a color number one now this is
the curl unit it is a Swiss lace L party
unit so you do give a nice parting space
and then some very soft lace now this is
a unit looks like guys it's kind of like
a spiral curly way now it does come to
variations in length they kind of feel
like they layer to frame your face which
I thought was cool one thing I like
about this unit is it doesn't have that
really shiny synthetic look so it does
give you that kind of like a natural
natural girl curly love kind of like a
twist out look in a way it is really
really curly and it is very very long
about 20 inches long I love my curl
units for the summer in springtime so I
have to show you guys this one
especially cuz her name is Dominique now
this one does not have baby hairs but
you can custom it does it know you can
custom your baby hairs it comes with
your standard comb in the back and two
combs on the side with adjustable strap
so if you're interested in seeing what
this unit looks like on me today I would
like you to stay tuned and keep on
watching
so this is basically what the unit looks
like obviously I saw the tile like I
just I kind of I like the hair texture I
like the whole look or whatever of the
curl pattern stuff like that I just
wasn't really digging the L part on this
wig I just felt like the L part was a
little bit thinking that root and it was
just hard to make it look realistic so
what I did was create this into my wig
unit my me my hat unit so I really like
this whole curly hair
puppy curly hair and then like the Hat
kind of flattened out in the middle like
this so I'm just going to create this
wig into my hat wig usually what that
means is like if I'm just wearing if I'm
like wanted to a be face so you had that
whole nineties vibe you know the whole
hip-hop v I wear you know like this with
a hat on just because the curls are
beautiful they're like really kinky and
pretty so I don't just look good as like
a just a curly unit that you just wear a
baseball cap with I'm just not feeling
the Pat the actual parting space and I
just think I can't I can't work my way
around that so therefore I'm going to
turn this into a way that's still going
to be cold still let me keep but it's
going to be warm with that so if you
know what I'm talking about like I have
a couple of wigs I just don't I'm not
digging that and making to my wig act my
hat my wishes yes that's what I call it
and I'm also making guys that they know
exactly don't talk about so leave a
comment down below of you know what I'm
saying now the good thing about this wig
is very inexpensive it's only 25 bucks
so if you're in the mood to spend 25
bucks for beautiful hair like this and a
racket other ways like you jessica
practice rock this with the turban on
top or you can even do like
bandana tie it up make you look you and
just kind of have the pattern hanging
out which I really think is the deal
this this hair is pretty now they do
have the half week version of this hair
so if you do
really pretty leave out I don't and I
don't have enough hands front to leave
out because I'm bald so if you if you
haven't let's leave out and you want to
do the halfway version I recommend doing
the half week version
I don't think all tray has really up
their skills with the L part so
therefore it's kind of like a a fee
situation with that one but other than
that if you want like the the half was I
think that would benefit better and it's
definitely cheaper than the way but if
it weighs like 25 $28 its lesson today
also that's one thing that you should
keep in mind when you when purchasing
this unit I definitely like the pattern
I just don't like the way it's
constructed meeting the L part I wish it
was different they should have just made
it into a middle part and then just
called it length luckily you know I'm
saying I could have just turn it to the
side and then reward in the middle which
has been cool with this link you really
can't do that because once you turn it
to the side it's kind of like an uneven
balance you kind of have like a like a
long bob or some like that so I was
just kind of you know what this going to
have to do so I definitely think it's
cuter like this guy just leave a comment
down below on what you think
also make sure you thumbs up this video
and hit that subscribe button I'm almost
at 50k people you guys are really right
a little bit and I'm so happy so I want
to say thanks and I will catch you guys
later on in the week bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
