and so having I came on as my eyes body
and so I didn't touch him I'm mo bhai
bhai
so Heidi
alright guys so this is the unit from
Sam Speedy's calm now this unit is from
the upscale collection and it is their
hundred percent unprocess full lace remy
hair now obviously if you guys saw in
the beginning this is not a full lace
wig it does give you like a little bit
of Swiss lace parting space and it's
already pre parted so you can't really
do that much with it but if you're a
very simple person that's not really wig
savvy and is looking for something
that's fabulous and cute I highly
recommend that you purchase this unit
now I'm not sure what the original price
of this unit is or if it's on sale or
whatever but I will linked on everything
down below for you guys so this is a
natural color it's a natural wave cut
texture it did originally just come in
20 inches long but that wasn't working
for me the hair was too thin at the ends
for it to be 22 inch 20 inches like I
just thought like that was more like a
16 inch or like maybe an 18 inch so I
just went in with my scissors and cut
the hair just directly so now it's more
so like a messy mid length hairstyle and
I absolutely love it like this guys that
look at this yes so I definitely like it
like this and it just looks way better
the hair is very very soft guys I didn't
get any tangling or shedding yet from
this hairy soft very pretty the parting
space was pretty good they pre-curved
parted this once all I did was add
powder too and it's a pretty good part I
did go in and play at the baby hairs
this unit does come with baby hairs but
I like my baby hairs a little bit longer
so that I have the ability to cut and
customize in my own way but if you don't
know how to do that it does come a baby
here that you can play with yourself I
do like this guys a lot it's a very soft
nice natural wave natural look it looks
really pretty and even the cut has set
it off and I even let me forgot this
very here but even the cut itself kind
of sets this style off I just think it
looks so much better cut and I did go
back in and diffuse it here after I cut
it and wet it so that the hair at the
bottom kind of like waved up along with
the entire hair so this hair works in
you
it's not different patterns different
mixes it's all in unison which I like so
guys I will leave all the information
down below for this you know don't
forget to thumbs up this video leave
your comments down below subscribe and
share this video with your friends and
family and I will catch you guys in the
later one but I had</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
