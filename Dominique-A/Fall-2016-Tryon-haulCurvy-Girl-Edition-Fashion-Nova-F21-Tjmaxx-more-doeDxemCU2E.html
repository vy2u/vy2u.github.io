to be sort of a different video in
today's videos you guys can see at the
hat title this is going to be a fall
2016 try on home and these are from
various places that I've just been
recently buying my items that I'm trying
to do different things on my channel so
I hope that this actually works make
sure you thumbs up this video and also
leave your comments down below this will
be a curvy girl edition
I consider myself curvy girl and you
guys will see once I try the clothes why
I consider myself curvy girl so I'll let
you guys see that for yourself but yeah
I don't want to ramble too much I'm just
going to show you guys two items that
I've gotten from various places I've
received packages within the last couple
days so I just decided to share that
with you guys for some styling or some
things that I like to wear for the
winter time that maybe you guys will be
interested in as well so the first place
I'm going to start off with is t.j.maxx
there's like I think there's like two TJ
Maxx and two Marshalls in the city that
I live in wrangle to them a lot and if
you guys know TJ Maxx Marshalls and home
goods are basically from the same
company so they usually have a lot of
really nice items so I did go out and
pick up some clothing items from them
that I really really liked so the first
choice that I have is from hot kists a
company called hot kiss and it also if
you are familiar with this brand so
basically this is one of those strap
those kind of like lace-up dresses it's
kind of like a short dress it's a very
very short dress
it's kind of like an off black color um
it kind of looks like they washed it has
been washed already but this is a
brand-new dress it has kind of like this
weird kind of black green look but I
really like the dress itself it does
have this really kind of velvety
material so therefore it really six to
the body it makes the body look really
really good so that's one reason why I
picked this dress out this isn't a size
large it is very um body might enhancing
so if you're trying to look really
really you know form-fitting and cute
this is a good dress to buy and this was
only $10 so the next two items that I
picked out and one of them is not the
original state because I did distress
one of these I picked up two pairs of
Levi's jeans um for me it's very hard
when it comes to buying jeans because
I'm top small and bottom heavy so I have
a hard time finding jeans that will fit
my waist
and then will fit my but because my
waist is smaller than my my legs in my
thighs my my thighs my butt so it's kind
of hard for me to find pants that are
small at the waist and bigger at the
bottom Levi's jeans on the other hand
they kind of stretch to an extent which
I like I got these in a size 12 I got
two pairs in a size 12
it fits my thighs when my waist is a
little bit small so it doesn't really
fit my waist that well so I just put
like a belt on with it just style it up
these didn't originally come like this
these were actually alway blue jeans but
I just added some cuts in it and washed
them and add a little bit distressed to
it they actually look really good I also
cut the bottom of the legs too if you're
looking for a video on how to distressed
jeans you can youtube search it or just
ask me to insert it down below but I
really like these jeans I kind of did
this to stress all the way through I got
these in the light wash and size 12 and
I also got like a dark wash as well in
the size 12
I love Levi's if you are very curvy on
curvy style girl Levi's jeans work very
well for women who are like very very
curvy just because it kind of like it
kind of forms the shape that you want
and kind of makes you look really really
smooth out so yeah those are the things
that I from TJ Maxx so the next place I
got stuff from with fashion Nova I
actually had some other things that ever
fashion over the during the summertime
but I'm not going to add those into here
because I've seen a thousand people into
review then like I said I usually have a
hard time buying jeans just because of
my body shape so I picked up these jeans
which I looked at before and bought them
from a store in Fordham Road in Burton
Bronx New York and so I know how they
fit and these are the Aphrodite pants
and I know some of you guys know these
are the ones which I kind of like the
small waist appear the high-waisted
jeans pants with those pockets on the
back these pants are do very well on my
body shape I got these I got all three
of these in size 11 I did previously get
size 13 but I noticed that the size 13
was way too big on the waist it was just
way too big and it didn't flatter me
that well so I went down to size 11 I
got them in a pair white hair and a
black pair as well but I did open the
blue jean when I saw try this one out
for you guys they all look the same
there are very high waisted form-fitted
type of pants and it looks really good
to mix that booty look pop it so I
really like that so those are the three
pants that I got from fashion
very simple so from forever21 I just
picked up this really cute hat and this
hat says 90s on it and it's a gene hat
I absolutely love his hat guys this hat
was 9090 cents from forever 21 this I'm
born 1990 so I just made the cutoff
point I thought that this hat was so
cute so I definitely wanted to get this
hat and it just look at that guy's it
looks just so cute
and like I don't know just with like
some straight hair maybe like some
ripped jeans a crap top and like a
leather jacket or something it would
just be all too poppin so I really like
this so I picked this up and it's
already cuffed really nicely so you
really don't have to do a lot of cooking
to this because it's already like know
what I'm saying so I really like this
hat here Wow
so I really like this and this was $10
so I'm very happy about this and the
fashion of jeans there were 30 dollars a
piece I believe for those on for those
style pants don't worry guys I'll link
everything down below for you guys you
guys aren't interested but those
fashions over jeans there were actually
30 hours to so the next thing I got from
forever 21 are these cute little ears
these ears were 3,000 90 cents I just
thought they were cute um a little cute
design to put on your head and stuff
like that
I'm really dorky like that and with my
short hair looks really cute so I just
got it because I thought it was cute for
the October Halloween s kind of period
so I just got these guys I know so the
next thing I picked up was probably the
most expensive thing for our me 21 was
this long line bomber jacket and it's in
the color olive and has black trim this
is actually better than what I thought
when I got in the mail this is actually
the bomber jacket that I got its long
line so basically it hits the bottom of
your little past your buttocks it covers
your bodice and little below but you
know it okay
so this is a more different than what I
thought when I got I thought it's going
to be really thin but this is actually
very padded inside and it's very warm so
if you are have if it's like a 60-degree
56 degree day and you don't want to wear
like your bubble jacket like it real
your real winter jacket you can actually
get away with this jacket from forever
21 it is very very thick has pockets on
the side right here like little pockets
right here as well as pockets in the
front I think that this jacket rocks and
this jacket was $39.90 and it actually
was worth it I did
Sara Ganim a snow jacket it was a
Michael Kors jacket and I got it from TJ
Maxx and I was like a hundred and twenty
dollars that took us X I'm gonna wear
that this summer but you know it's just
a couple dollars this is a couple
dollars less and I feel like it's just
as warm as that jacket that I got so
this was actually a really good deal for
the winter time although it doesn't have
a hood on it but those days that it's
not snowing and it's not really the wind
is not too sharp you'll be fine just
wearing this so the next thing I got
from forever 21 is this cute little crop
top sweater this crop top sweater oh my
god it's like inside out Dom hello so
this little crop top sweater I think
that I was really cute is this really
cute kind of orange E and that orange
yellow is kind of mustard look I got
this a couple months ago but I didn't
wear it in the summertime because it was
too hot so I purposely planned to wear
it this winter
this color is great for for the fall
season especially with the leaves
changing colors I thought this was cute
it's a nice thick material Eve I got
this one for about ten dollars $9.90 as
well so I thought that this was a great
deal the next thing I got and I got two
of the same items so the next thing I
got are these cute dresses from forever
21 and these were nine dollars and
ninety cents each I got these in a size
medium and this is the color walnut
these are body con dresses I think that
this color is so cute it's more so of a
stone color or I guess walnut I gotta
know where they get the walnut bumper
this is more like a stone color I think
that this is so nice guys in a submitted
dress it does have a nice thick strap so
if you do wear a bra your bra will not
be shown and you have some good support
there's no deep be cut in this one so
you basically have a lot of protection
you're now looking to boobage in front
of people and that's that and I also
picked that one up in black as well
because you can never go wrong with
black so the next thing I got is one is
something that I really like I picked
this up actually in store and this is a
cute shirt these distressed tees that
they have and he's distressed kind of
like rock panties um this one was a
little bit more pricier than I
anticipated I never would really pay
that much money for screen t all those
distressed I feel like I kind of did it
by myself but I'm lazy and I didn't want
to do that so I decided to buy it
so this I know they feature this online
so I
pick us up in the store I kind of got in
the store it's basically like a
de-stress a t-shirt like a screen t this
is not a rock band obviously but there
I've seen a lot of people worn the ones
with the distressed rock band tees this
one is really cute it has that go this
little like a shoelace pattern right
here it does show a little bit of boobs
but because it's so um thick so much of
that lace thing you want me to get that
much of a breast look but you get a
little bit of a skin shown and a little
bit of a cleave I think this is really
cool what I'm probably going to do with
this one is am just take a bleach spray
a bleach bottle and just spray just to
make it look a little bit more edgy and
add some holes in just to make a look
more oh you know like real distress um I
think this one actually go good with one
of my high waisted pants on fashion over
or my distress Levi's jeans and some
heels as just a kind of like a date
night or going out things so I'm really
excited about wearing this if you guys
want a styling video just leave that
down below for me and I would do a
styling video on these items that I've
done so the next thing I got was this
cute little bodysuit this is a very
simple bodysuit guys the thing with this
bodysuit is it's a very you have to be
careful with this bodysuit just because
it shows a lot of breasts I would
probably say we're a plunge bra with
this or actually take your breasts up
but I feel like yeah I mean yeah I want
to either say tape your boobs up or wear
plunge bra that kind of really like
holds the babies together because I got
a lot of tits in this one this is cute
it's a very nice it's kind of what
colors is this is this is a Coco color I
thought this was so nice it was like a
nice color I got this in a size medium
it fits very well I thought it was
perfect this will go really well with
jeans or any of the high-waisted pants
that are from fashion Nova any
distressed jeans or boyfriend jeans or
girlfriend jeans I thought this would
look really good with that I mean just
have the clasp on the bottom so you can
collapse yourself shut so that was cool
and like I said does have a deep punch
line so if you have breasts like boobs I
would say either wear plunge bra or take
them bad boys together if you ain't got
no boobs which I wish I still had no
boobs I'm just joking if you have any
boobs you probably get away with it no
problem but I usually have hard nips all
the time so gotta tape
or cover-up so once that's true that I
got was this cute little choker and this
is basically for four thousand ninety
cents and this is uh just kind of like a
material o'clock material choker it does
have an adjustable adjustable area in
the back so I just thought it was cute
and it was kind of like a wide style
choker it would look really cute just to
wear with the bodycon dress jean jacket
and some converse sneakers just simple
and maybe like a ponytail I just always
think about stuff like that so yeah this
was only to be an idea picked it up well
I like 490 and I picked it up so the
next item and I think it's the last item
is this cute crop top that I got this is
a keyhole crop top this crop top I
really feel is like really really nice
guys it has a has like this little cute
crumb keyhole on the front of it the
thing I like a lot about this crop top
is that the materials are very nice
material you can dress this up with
dress up pants maybe a pencil skirt
high-waisted pencil skirt it would look
really cute for night outfits in the
wintertime with a nice long trench or a
blazer jacket on top of it
like I said with these you want to be
careful if you have big boobs because
you will show a lot of breasts in here
so that I would be careful with I
actually got this one in a size medium
this was twelve thousand ninety cents
and it fits good and I'm surprised that
it's not as tight as I thought it would
be so I have one more item if I could
find the item I don't know what I did
with it yeah
 okay
so last but not least guys this is the
last item that I've gotten from the from
forever 21 and this isn't an axial basic
collection this is another shirt another
style the lace-up style but this shirt
is different guys it's kind of like that
legging material that really kind of
spandexy legging material but the thing
with these types of shirts they really
really are very tight to the body and
they really form the body up I got this
one in black and this is a size small
medium and this was $12.90 it's just a
regular shirt but like I said this is a
nice material where you can pair this
with high waisted pants high-waisted
skirt jeans or anything like that and it
can just you can go from being not so it
could be go from being basic to not so
basic people so I think that this is
cute and I picked this up too I don't
know if I'm kind of falling off the
trend with all these lace-up things but
I think I'm coming back to the trend so
yeah so that was my um fall 2016 haul a
fashion haul and I hope you guys enjoyed
