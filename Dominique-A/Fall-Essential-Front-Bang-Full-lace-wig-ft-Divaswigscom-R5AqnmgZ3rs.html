calm now it's a really really nice sweet
guys
so I reviewed a front bang wig like last
year or last season so I wanted to do
another one for my channel now this one
is longer this is about like 22 inches
long now
this wig is really really nice when I
received the wig when I was ordering
processing the order with the company I
did ask them to thin the bang out the
only issue that I had with his wig was
the bang the bang was way too thick and
too long so off-camera guys I did have
to go in and cut the bang just a little
bit to frame my face and to not hug my
eyes too much and then I do go in with
my eyebrow shaper and that kind of like
been the bang out a little bit for me it
was just a little bit too thick and I
don't like that thick look just because
it doesn't even up with the hair I hate
having hair that's not not necessarily
thin my hair that's not as bulky as a
bang cuz it just looks funny initially
when you look at it so I went in with my
eyebrow shaver and I just kind of shaved
the front bang out a little bit and I
think that it actually blends in really
nice now I actually like it better like
this and I didn't show you guys how I
did it because I was terrified when I
even started I'm not really good at
stuff like that so I didn't want to mess
it up and then just be like damn this is
embarrassing on camera so I kind of did
it alone and away from camera so that I
can perfect it myself so it's not one of
my favorite things to do but I managed
to kind of get it the way I wanted it to
I probably have to add some hairspray
just right here because when I was kind
of thinning the hair out
you do kind of get like some spiky parts
some kind of flyaways at the top so I'll
go in with a little bit of spray just to
cover that out a little bit and use my
flat iron to press it down but I do like
it though it's kind of it's a little bit
thinner and it doesn't look so bulky
like I hate that bulky look so this
shoot is about 22 inches I think 20 or
22 inches I will linked on everything
down below for you guys I do like it a
lot it's definitely a really good unit
for the fall it's not so thick I believe
this wig is about one hundred fifty
hundred eighty percent density it's a
nice length guys I do like the fact that
the hair texture is not a silky texture
it's almost like a late yaki texture
which kind of gives you more of that
realistic bye
it is a full lace wig so you therefore
you can part it and do all that kind of
crazy mess if you want to they do do
like a little bit of parting space up
there so I just added some powder on it
to kind of define it a little bit but
other than that I do like this it fits
perfect ear to ear so this unit is
pretty pretty popping if you're looking
for a unit that is a front bang unit you
don't necessarily have to find a get a
full lace you can just get a lace front
or kind of like a good portion at the
front that is you know front bang styled
so I do like this I'm trying to think
I'm gonna do that hairstyle where girls
usually do that front bang they have
like that but at the top so I'm gonna
try to get my cousin to come over in
style this week that way because I think
that would be cute so you guys will see
me in my hairstyle in a later video
maybe an on a trying haul so don't miss
out for that one now I'll definitely
post a picture on Instagram for you guys
to show you guys what it looks like when
I do style it that way it is a full lace
wig so I can glue it all the way around
the perimeter and then style it as I
please so that's a good thing so the
only thing I did with this one was just
straighten it just a little bit the hair
was already straight so I just set my
straight straightener through it for
like two seconds and I was done so that
was a good thing I feel like you guys
it's a really nice light it's not a
heavy unit and you definitely can switch
up your Styles with this look in the
winter and I also think if you put some
light curls into this here will look
pretty to like light curls and then like
straight at the ends that kind of like
messy fun look which I love but that's
for another video
so guys do not forget to thumbs up this
video leave your comments down below
subscribe and share this video with your
friends and family and I will catch you
guys in a later one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
