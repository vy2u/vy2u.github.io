today with another try on haul video for
you guys so in today's video I'll be
showing you guys some clothes from a
uk-based website called we're all calm
now I would set a whole bunch of items
from them and I'm really excited about
this one because I have done a haul with
them
with the collaborated with them before
so they do have some really nice items
especially for the transitioning of fall
so in today's video it's going to be a
little bit different so when I turn on
the clothes this time I'm going to
actually style them so you've probably
seen with a lot of jackets and stuff
like that and pieces obviously changed
my hair where all the outfits that I
ever do so you'll see a lot of that as
well continued in this video so I want
to kind of show you guys how to pull the
outfits together if I was actually
wearing it out on a daily basis so that
you guys can get the full idea and that
is easier for you to purchase these
items of confidence now I will link all
the items down below for you guys if you
guys are interested in purchasing these
items
this is uk-based so if you live in
Canada or you live overseas somewhere
else I will leave the shipping
information down below because that's
really important I know some people in
Canada have a hard time getting packages
from overseas and it takes a little bit
longer for me it took about 7 to 14 days
so they didn't expedite this when they
sent it to me the same way someone the
United States would get it so keep that
into consideration so guys I will linked
on everything down below if you're
interested in seeing what I have to
offer in today's Sean hall I would like
you to stay tuned to keep on watching
alright guys so the first thing I'm
gonna start off today with guys is some
tops now the first thing I'm gonna show
you guys is this cute bodysuit now I
usually don't like that see-through
stuff too too much like I'll wear it
like once in a while but this whole
pattern with like the floral pattern
type of see-through top thing has been
cute
now one warning and I'm gonna put
parental advisory down here because I
don't want anyone trying to flag my
video so this top is definitely a
see-through top now the model on the
thing actually worked like it was able
to cover her nipple area so I'm gonna
say especially when it comes to
african-american it's kind of different
cuz your aerial is actually brown so
therefore it'll kind of mix with the
black mesh paneling on here but I still
feel like I could see like my nips a
little bit but I thought this was cute
it does have like maybe like one flower
PC that could
kind of cover you which is right in the
front right here so if you kind of
squeeze your boobs right in the front
here kind of covers areola
it's very nice guys it's like a floral
style mesh bodysuit it does come with a
black bottom and I would definitely wear
this with high-waisted jeans I actually
would even wear this sort of fall fur
which is funny if I had like a jacket
faux fur like a long or like a short
crop top black one it would look so cute
with this one with some over the knee
heeled boots and some jeans but I
thought this was really cute it does
come with a zipper on the side so once
you put it on you just want to step into
it and then it'll fit and you just zip
it to the side to close yourself in it
is plunge neck and it does have these
two like accent strings in the middle
it's kind of weird because these strings
are actually really loose so I'll
probably have to just double sew it down
here to kind of tighten it up but it's
really cute gives it a little bit of
detail and it is very very sexy guys so
if you're going like move it to like a
party or something like that and you
want to just jazz up some jeans I
definitely recommend wearing this I also
would recommend maybe putting like those
little black pasties on your boobs just
to kind of hide that areolas a little
bit if you're not too bold Z I probably
would just because it's a little bit
daring and not every day you want to be
daring and this outfit can also be
classy so you can kind of set it off
that way too now the next thing I got it
is white so I'm not gonna hold it up to
the camera because it'll wash me out so
it's basically what it was really
popular kind of long sleeve cropped tops
that you have to tie too close
now this one is a white color and it's
so so cute it is a very very soft cotton
material which is strange
I almost envisioned it when I saw it on
the website is being kind of like a
polyester material but this one is
actually cotton and it's really cute
like this one is a size 14 again and iOS
it made in he has to size 14 I'm not
sure that's a UK 14 or US 14 but like I
said I will link all the sizes down
below for you guys now this is really
cute a very soft kind of like forgiving
material so it's more loose and like
free and fun so I'm definitely going to
rock this one with like a jacket leather
jacket um palazzo pants like stuff like
that would just really make the outfit
look really cute and I just thought it
was really nice if you do have large
breasts and
in the highest sizes maybe like a 14
you'll be okay because this is very very
loose and stretchy I don't have big
boobs so this fits fine so I'm really
really excited to wear this and style it
up in the winter okay so the next I'm
going to show you guys this is super
cute cardigan sweater now this is a
longline cardigan sweater and it does
say that it's a size 16 18 I don't know
if that's UK or us I'm so confused
alright guys but it's like this charcoal
color it's really really long like what
I mean long it's super super long I love
stuff like this in the winter time just
because it looks good with like leggings
like t-shirts and like Minnetonka boots
like I don't know it's something about
it just really really I like so I wanted
to get a charcoal color cuz I don't have
one it does it's a really really long
really long sweater
it has about quarter length it could is
it quarter length season if it's not no
it's full link sleeves but it doesn't
come all the way to the end of your is
so it comes like a little bit like right
here but it's really really cute guys
very soft materials like a cotton
material I actually wish that I had some
pockets in the front right here I
thought it would been cute if you had
like a little bit of pockets and like
two little pockets in the front but it
does fit really nice
I also wish that it was like kind of
like a little bit bigger where it kind
of really wrapped around you this one
kind of stops right on the sides and if
it did like a complete wrap it would've
been like perfect but it doesn't but hey
but it definitely is something that I
love in the winter love style miss up
with a nice scarf
ooh scarf for me a jean jacket or Jean
vest oh I love stuff like that alright
guys so the next thing I want to show
you guys is this longline jean jacket
that I got now this has been trending
for the last few weeks maybe a month or
so and it is so so popular like even
fashion Nova has it a lot of these
websites just showing this so big skates
like instead of having a longline bomber
jacket it's a longline jean jacket so
you get the jean jacket all the way past
her butt and it's just like so cute to
stress and everything so we're all
actually had this in stock on their
website so I picked this one out and I
think I got this one in a size let's see
I got this one in a size a large people
size large now
this one is super distress all around I
will kind of show you guys a little bit
of it because the light is gonna wash me
out it's super distress on the sleeves
on the back it's really nice the way
they colored this one is perfect too
they have like some dark parts and then
kind of some like nice light like blue
parts on it it fits very well it's
almost like an oversized jean jacket so
if you are a little bit bigger than I am
I believe you'll be able to fit it I do
have large arms so my arms fit and it
was not not even being tight or anything
like that so this one worked out good
and to follow the trend this is actually
really really nice you can wear this to
a body contrast sweater dress you can
wear with just about anything styled up
with boots over the knee Hamm boots
sneakers which is my favorite and I did
actually go buy some sneakers of the day
that'll be for my next I'll show you
guys a whole bunch of stuff that I got
in a collective haul but yeah
so there's ways to start and keep it I
don't know I'm just really excited about
this fall this jacket is so pretty guys
and I highly recommend getting on the
long line bottom jean jackets because
that thing is like really popular right
now things I'm gonna show you guys are
some really cute dresses now I've always
wanted this one dress I'm gonna show you
guys and it's been it's like it's like
such a cool like kind of schoolgirl
style dress and I've always always
wanted a dress like this and when I saw
it on the website I was like you know
what I'm gonna get it so I am gonna try
to do like a fall lookbook for you guys
hopefully I can fit it in in a week
where I'm doing a try on haul lookbook
and a couple here videos because that's
what I like to do I like to give you
guys extras and it's funny because I
always be like oh videos every Wednesday
and Friday I say that because my videos
are technically every Wednesday and
Friday guaranteed I usually stick a
Sunday video in Monday or Tuesday and
maybe a Thursday video I really do
Thursdays but I like to give you guys my
permanent schedule and they surprise you
guys with extra videos just because
sometimes I want to give you guys a lot
more than what you guys expect from me
you feel me so this dress that I'm going
to show you guys it's cool it's kind of
like a schoolgirl style dress it comes
with that little cute detailed collar at
the top which I liked and I like this
because I'm really a dress and sneaker
type of girl so and the far likes to do
a lot a dress is with stocking sneakers
like
let's mix my style up a little bit and
this summertime I'm more and then
in the wintertime I become more refine
you know really like cloaked up let me
stop playing around before you guys like
why did she even say that but you know
what I mean
and that's summertime you weren't free
when you wear your clothes you don't
care I'm not sitting on a twitch I still
care but I'm trying to be warm in the
winter you don't know say I'm trying to
be warm and cute at the same time so I'm
keeping my outfits in the wintertime
more comfortable but very nice put
together classy and poppin so I thought
that this was cute it's more like a
skater dress and it does sound like this
really cute white collar I like this so
much because it made me think about
outfit ideas to rock it with my high-top
van sneakers my adidas track star I did
a track star
adidas superstar sneakers or something
like that even like Doc Martin boots
will look cute with this it's very kind
of like schoolgirl with an edge so I
like this a lot guys it is long-sleeve
and it's very pretty it's not a short
and I'm happy because sometimes I buy
dresses it ends up being shorter than I
want and I just its unwearable at that
point but with this one you can
definitely wear it with like a longline
bomber jacket the jean jacket a leather
jacket and just kind of elaborate on the
style so I thought that this was super
super cute now the next choice I got
it's not it's more transitional I'm
gonna say that it's more transitional it
definitely is a tank top style dress I
like this one because it was so skater
stand star inspired so I got it so it's
kind of like a nice kind of mocha tan
color and I thought that this was really
cute I love colors like this against my
skin it's very simple it's like a thin
material and it's a size 8 12 8 10 and I
believe that other dress is a 8/10 as
well I liked it because of the color and
I thought about like pieces that I could
put together with this one this is like
a very nice soft dress that you can just
wear with like maybe like fishnets oh my
god I love you so cute we're kind of
like fishnet stockings and the leather
jacket and like kind of Doc Martin boots
just like very simple pieces like that
that you can style so I thought this was
really cute and I wanted to get it so I
picked it out and I believe this was
kind of this wasn't the basic item items
and it was very inexpensive too so if
you're looking for dresses like this
they had
I think that Burgundy but I went for
this mocha color just because I thought
it would be really nice to style up for
the season and this is definitely like
one of those seasonal colors so the next
thing I got is a really cute sweater now
this was supposed to be a sweater dress
but there is no way that this is getting
worn as a sweater dress because it's way
too short now it's really cute though
guys I tried it on the other day and I
was like oh my god this is so cute and I
have like my straight wig on I was like
oh my god this is so pretty so I
definitely liked it when I picked it I
was like you know let me just pick this
out because I want to see what it looks
like I'm not really like too big and
buying sweaters from companies just
because if you some companies their
sweaters are itchy AF so I was like you
know what let me just try it out so this
is kind of like one of those it's like
I'm considering it a sweater because I
can't wear this as a dress my body is
not gonna press that gonna permit that
so it's a sweater that actually has a
cutout under the top so your head goes
through here and it has a cutout right
here it also has the cold shoulder
sleeves on the side and it has a ton of
distress going down the front side and
the back side so it's kind of like a
holey sweater so you get a lot of action
with this but I like the way it's
silhouettes on me and the way it looks
we're almost cut out parts it looks so
so cute now it is kind of chunky at the
neck so the fact that it's chunky at the
neck and then has that opening and the
opening on the sleeves just gives it
like it gives me like a different vibe
like I really really like it this is not
an itchy material at all and it's not
thick so it's a little bit thin so you
can get away with this in like October
kind of into November like the beginning
of November and after that you need to
put something underneath this or
something over it I would recommend
wearing this with kind of leggings and
then just boots like some regular
opening heeled boots they don't have to
be heels just regular over-the-knee
boots um I think that would be really
cute I'm a minute talk a person in the
wintertime so I don't know if you guys
and I mean I'm pretty sure you guys know
what Minnetonka's are I have like
they're from the long frayed ones and
those are my favorite ones are like the
nice natural tan color or kind of like
the Minnetonka flats I love stuff like
that in the winter I like kill those
every season I always buy a new pair
beat them up
throw those out the next season
by a new one so these are like this is
like sweaters and Minnetonka's with
leggings it's like something I like to
wear and I'll instead of put your what
Minnetonka's look like or maybe I won't
because you guys should know what that
is by now but yeah that's something that
I wear and I just like that on the
winter just leggings Minnetonka
sweatshirt sweater cardigan and then I'm
good to go so that's mostly what I wear
for the most part especially you have to
run errands but I do like this this is
very stylish guys so I'd recommend
styling this up it's really cute it's
very soft not heavy and it's definitely
going to work so the last two items are
pretty simple pretty straightforward
very comfortable on the contrary so this
is a two-piece suit that I got and I
believe I got something like this before
the last time I'm not sure I'm trying to
recollect but I don't remember guys so
just act like you've never seen it
before and that this is the first time
so it's a cute little grey sweater set
now I really like these two-piece sets
for the winter just because if you
really don't got nothing to wear and
this is in your closet I recommend
wearing something like this now it is a
really nice soft kind of sweater
sweatshirt material it's just like a
regular sweatshirt and it comes with the
matching sweat pants now it does have
pockets in the pants which I like I love
a good pocket in my pants it does have
like a fake elastic a bit elastic string
in the front but these don't it's not a
real band it's not a real string so
these are kind of like stretchy anyways
I believe I got this one in a size why
is the size not on here peeps I believe
this is a size 1214 or let's see nope
this is a UK size 16 a US size 12 and it
fits very very nice it is skinny at the
ankles guys which I like so you're not
getting that wide ankle so it's skinny
at the ankles and skinny at the arms as
well so it's very very soft this is
something that I would recommend wearing
if you're in a rush I like to put layers
with this stuff too meaning putting a
jacket over it and I will also wear this
with sneakers and maybe like some kind
of furry furry slides and stuff like
that it's really comfortable very quick
outfit to wear and you get you put it on
and you're
go if you want to style this up make it
real fast you can make it real fast but
it's a sweat suit I don't know how much
fast you can get out of this one but
it's something comfortable and I do love
having my comfortable days and I know
everybody loves a comfortable day so
getting yourself a two-piece set like
this is definitely gonna work for you
it's definitely gonna be something you
gonna run to especially when you're in a
rush and you need something to wear now
the last item that I got is a very
simple item if you want to my last try
and I will link it up here I showed you
guys that one cute little jumpsuit thing
with the kind of Hammer style pants
hareem's does have a Reem hurryin style
pants so this one I actually got in that
kind of tan mocha color again but this
one is different because this one is
more so of a shorter version the other
ones came all the way down to my ankles
and this one stops like right above my
ankles which is kind of weird but I do
like the color which is the reason why I
chose this and for this one I'm
definitely gonna style this up it's more
so kind of like a blob outfit so you put
it on and you're kind of looking like or
than the well so I'm definitely gonna
have to go in and kind of flavor this up
adding an accent belt a jacket cardigan
sweater I wouldn't either still wear
this right now in the beginning with
sandals and maybe go off and wear that
kind of Converse sneakers with after
just to kind of elaborate this is
definitely something you can make more
of a sporty look so I like this a lot
guys I think I got this one and this one
is a UK 1618 a US size 12 14 so like I
said guys they do range in sizes so they
do go up to a size 14 in the US and I
believe some items go into 16 u.s. so
you definitely find your stuff on this
