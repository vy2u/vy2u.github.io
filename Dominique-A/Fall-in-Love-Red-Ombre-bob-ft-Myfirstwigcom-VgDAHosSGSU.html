Oh
and that
how's it going some back today with
another with Wednesday video and today's
wig that I'm showing you guys is from my
first wigs calm now today I'm going to
show you guys one of their ombre style
units now this unit is the number two
and a 99 J so you get some dark roots in
the beginning and then you get a nice
cherry red burgundy style ombre now I
picked this wig up for the purpose of
transitioning from summer to fall now
red is usually a really nice color for
the Fall like more of a burgundy type of
red this one works perfect so I thought
it was cute to kind of show you guys a
Bob that was transitional unto the fall
so this one was a perfect unit to choose
now this does come at about five inches
of parting space in the beginning that's
a lot of parting space guys right hence
that stops all the way here and it also
has two combs at the top along with a
comb in the back with an adjustable
strap so this one will be nice and
secure on my head I might not add an
elastic band to that so I'm gonna see
how it is without an elastic band now it
is a really nice stretchy cap as well
too so if you do have a larger size head
you'll have a lot of space in this unit
now it does come with baby hairs around
the perimeter as usual and they are a
bit long so I'll probably trim them up
but I will show you guys how I do that
now it's really really pretty guys look
at the texture it's silky straight and
it is such a nice color so what I'm
gonna do is straighten this out cut the
lace off and then come and show you guys
how I baby hair down and how I style it
I hope you guys are interested in seeing
what this looks like guys today so if
you're interested thank you to keep on
watching
so this is the unit and this is how I
got it to love guys I'm so so happy I
love love love this look like it's so
pretty
now this is 12 inches long I did not do
any adjustments to the cut I basically
just went in with my curling iron and
just did some soft curls and basically
what I did is curl the base of the hand
I left it at left and go straight so I
didn't curl it all the way through I
just like how choppy and fun it looks
like that so I want to go for that look
now this is definitely unit I would
recommend you guys purchasing if you're
looking for holiday looks like this
would look good for Thanksgiving this
will look good for Christmas New Year's
Valentine's them go all the way into
next year because this unit right here
is it now it gives me really really a
nice sexy vibe like the cut and then the
I had in the middle part before but
middle part for me it's like I'm stuck
here and they're like sometimes like and
sometimes I don't
so what I did is I went into like kind
of like a nice curved part remember this
has about five inches of parting space
so you can go about anywhere you want
and get yourself a beautiful part so I
do like a curved part right here fix
some of the baby hairs and then I also
put a little bit of glue on the side of
sideburns right here so I can lay down
this area right here so I can achieve
this kind of like behind-the-ear look
now I did play with the baby here's
around the perimeter - I didn't go too
crazy because the hairline is so
realistic on this unit that you don't
have to go ham I guys I just I really
really really really like this like this
is definitely a wig that I would
purchase if I have events coming up and
you don't want a lot of hearing your
back this is definitely a great unit
from transition from summer to fall this
red color is
so it's a vibrant but it's not too much
and it definitely pulls on my skin
complexion too so and then I even had to
put the red lip in because I had to come
to you guys correct with this one
because listen this is it guys like and
look at the balance look look this is a
silky straight unit and you get so much
bounce and like fun play with it it's
just let guys please leave one of the
comments if this is not it because this
is it like my first week's comm has
definitely been coming through with it
with the wigs that I'm very very
impressed very very pleased this is my
fourth unit that I'm reviewing for this
company and I'm absolutely impressed
I really rarely have anything negative
to say when it comes to units like this
but this one right here guys is
definitely definitely one that I
purchased the color the style everything
about it is a plus so guys that's about
it do not forget guys to thumbs up this
