today with another Kirby slash think
girl try and haul video so in today's
video guys it's gonna be slightly
different because today's video is gonna
be a strictly ma haul video so you guys
asked me a lot of times like what story
that shot that when I go to the mall so
I went to a couple places in the last
two weeks and shopped around and found
like a little bit of things that I liked
so I definitely went to Primark at the
Danbury Fair Mall I also went to forever
21 and Charlotte Russe now I haven't
been to Charlotte Russe in like three
years so when I went in I was kind of
like mmm you know I'm used to buying
shoes from them but I didn't find any
shoes that I liked this time so I kind
of went straight to the accessories
section so I'll show you guys a lot of
items that I got I did get more
accessories this time versus getting
clothes but I did get a bulk of clothes
to show you guys as well so that it's a
good consistency of a video so I'll try
to link all the information down below
for you guys as you guys know Primark
doesn't have an online website where
they feature the items so if you do live
by a Primark if you're in Connecticut
there's one I'd am very fair model and I
believe there's one in New York that's
getting built in Brooklyn I'm not sure
if it's up there yet if it's already
done but it should be done around this
season so crossing our fingers that it
comes up by December because it's
definitely a great place to go holiday
shopping like it's poppin' so I believe
all the information down below as far as
forever21 and Charlotte rules and if
you're interested in seeing what I have
to offer in today's try and haul guys I
would like you to stay tuned and keep on
well we're gonna start off with today is
forever 21 now only got three items from
forever 21 just because I was going
through the stuff and it's so confusing
when you walk in that store you're just
kind of like your heads like like it was
just really confusing so I just picked
up three items that I saw that I liked
and I tried on and I was like okay this
will work so I kind of try to keep my
things kind of fall inspired guys just
because it's fall so it's not really
like I could run away winter will be
here like December 22nd so it's kind of
like Dom you got to kind of combine
outfits together layer up and kind of
get your things situated so I'm gonna
show you guys some items I got and there
are three tops that I got so and they
were all actually really inexpensive I
don't think I paid over $10 for any one
of these tops and usually you could find
shirts and stuff like that for good
prices if you look in forever 21 in the
front of the store they usually have all
their discount and item
your cell items so it's going made for
my seven bucks it's a 10 bucks 12 bucks
14 bucks and it can either go from being
a jacket to address two shirts so you
kind of have variety and even sometimes
they add pants something for like $10 so
you got to be really looking when you
walk into the store because they
definitely always have great deals so
the first type that I got it was trendy
about like last season so I might not
even last season like two seasons ago
two years ago but I saw and I never got
the opportunity to buy it because I
didn't know how to wear it before so I
picked this one up this time so
basically it's like a white top guys and
it has like this lace bralette that's
attached to it now I can't really put it
up too close to the screen because it'll
wash me out
white definitely washes me out when I
try to show you guys and you guys know
that from my previous videos so it's
kind of like a white t-shirt style top
guys and it has like a black bra lit on
top the black Prahlad is really cute
it's kind of like like a regular bra lit
but obviously it's not it's opaque so
therefore you'll be able to see like if
you wore this without the top you'll be
able to see your nipples and stuff like
that so I thought it was cute the
concept of attaching a t-shirt it kind
of gives them more like a casual slash
kind of like a going out type of vibe
and if you're someone that's really
casual I actually think that this would
be really cute to wear wear like joggers
I know that's weird like going with
joggers and sneakers I thought that
would be a cute idea I got this in a
size extra large and it was only eight
dollars on sale like I said this was
kind of like a two seasons ago type of
top but I liked it I saw and I never got
the opportunity to buy it the first time
so I was like you know what I'm gonna
take the initiative this time and
purchase this one and try to style it up
for this fall so I thought it was really
cute so I picked this one out and it was
only 850 and 850 forever21 has been
getting kind of expensive lately so when
I saw this for 850 I was like this is a
yes now the next stop I got is really
cute guys and I liked it I'm not usually
someone that likes to wear like a lot of
girly girly tops so I had the next two
I'm going to show you guys they're
really girly girly meaning like it's
kind of like frou-frou and like pretty
and stuff like that
I'm usually boring I usually kind of
wear like kind of like shirts like
t-shirts with like riding on it or like
kind of graphic tees or I kind of do
like playing tops like playing mom's
sleeve over oversized
tops and stuff like that I just take a
lot of my boyfriend's clothes and where
it has tops and stuff like that and kind
of pair with ripped jeans leggings so
I'm really really
kind of like a casual person most of the
time other than going out so this type I
thought was so cute and I'm going doing
like a lot of holiday things this season
so how about holiday parties to go to
and like I have like a lot of events to
go to so I thought this was a cute top
so it's a white top and the thing that I
really like and that's really trending
now is the sleeve thing so kind of like
those wide sleeves kind of like those
what do you call it bell sleeves or
whatever so the sleeves aren't really
nice and like Bell style I got this one
in a size extra large as well this one
was was nine dollars I thought that this
was cute it's kind of like a woven
material so it's very light and airy
it's not cotton and it's not that really
satiny kind of polyester mix material so
it looks really nice it fits really nice
and it just has a really light kind of
look to it and I thought it would be
really people to kind of dress pants
flats or like maybe like a really small
heel and some like nice plain black
jeans and like a leather jacket I
thought that would look so cute together
so I'm definitely to wear this to one of
my Christmas parties that I'm gonna turn
this season I just thought it was really
nice it's a nice white top like wearing
like a really simple hairstyle I kind of
have like a couple wigs I wear with this
kind of like a pixie short wig or kind
of doing that maybe like a nice long
middle part curled wig or straight wig I
don't know I have so many ideas but you
guys know I always style all my outfits
with different here because I'm just
weird like that but I definitely thought
this top was very cute now the next
topic is kind of like one of those
peasant tops and I used to kill peasant
tops peasant tops like two three years
ago I used to kill it because peasant
tops they're not tight they're kind of
flowy and they're kind of like a
pregnancy tops as well and they just
like look really good I used to wear
them all the time because I was so
comfortable wearing them so this one is
the size large and this was ten dollars
this one's really cute guys it's like a
navy blue color and it has like a really
cute kind of like see-through design and
the top kind of lace design it's a kind
of woven material so it's very soft very
nice guys I do like the blue color
definitely its fall kind of inspired
blue Burgundy's green and blue burgundy
and green yeah blue burgundy and green
are kind of like your fall colors so I
thought that this was really cute they
did have it in Burgundy and yellow as
well but I
decided to go for the blue cuz I don't
really have that many blue items in my
closet so it's for the cute guys it has
buttons going down and you kind of
button it to open it up but I just put
over my head it fit perfectly fine it
does kind of have like those kind of
bell sleeves as well not even bell see
they kind of get tight at the ends which
I thought was nice and but they're kind
of wide sleeves as well too I just
thought that this was really cute it's
very comfortable it's a nice color to
wear with kind of like jeans dark jeans
black jeans leggings and you can just
kind of go crazy with the shoe wear just
whatever with this top I just thought it
was nice and it just gave more of a
winter feel it gave more of a
comfortable feel as well too like I said
in the fall I love to be comfortable
with my clothes I don't like to be tight
and secure I just like to be real
comfortable and nice alright guys so the
next few things I got were some things
from Charlotte Russe and I also got some
stuff from forever21 alright guys so the
next thing I'm going to show you guys
are some accessory items that I got from
Charlotte Russe and I also realized that
I got some items from forever21 as well
so I kind of mix the accessories
together so the first few things I got
from Charlotte wheels are some stud
earrings like I really like stud
earrings so I picked up two packs so the
regular wants the dark just like regular
diamond earrings and I'll bring it up
close to the camera so you guys can see
on the side so I just got basically like
regular stud earrings and it came with
three so they give you like a large size
medium size and a tiny size they're not
real obviously and the sale was two for
$10 which is always your sell on jewelry
so I got to the next one I got it's kind
of like one of those kind of rhinestone
diamond ones which are kind of like
crystallized and kind of have like more
of like expensive look to it so I don't
you pick these up to an hour obviously I
already took one off of the set that I
was rocking I like these because they're
like really nice small and they give
like a lot of glamour to your look I
like that kind of like diamond kind of
sparkly look to it so I just I don't
know i usually wear those a lot if you
guys ever see my hair videos when i
close up my earrings are always like
diamonds glam like earrings not too big
but just enough to give you like a
little bit of a glare a little bit of a
feel so i always buy these now i've been
really into layering necklaces so
obviously you guys see our layered
necklace is now more often I've been
cutting into where
hoop earrings and laying my necklaces
and stuff like that it's just something
I've been really into so um this
necklace that I have right here is from
my name necklace it's my mom's name and
Arabic and it's I got in the kid side so
it can be like choker style so I usually
wear this a lot along with my
boyfriend's name that's also choker
style and this necklace tri necklace set
that I got here is actually from romwe
calm so I really like these a lot and it
just gives your neck like a little bit
more of a glam look now my earrings are
from the hair store and they're just
regular I've been into wearing hoops too
something about that whole vibe like
wearing hoops and earrings are just into
it it's so 90s for me so I'm just
feeling it so I went to forever 21 I
picked up some of their necklaces so I
got another necklace said that's kind of
like a double necklace set this is not
tri so this is definitely gonna work to
add to this one right here now it's just
simple it's just kind of like a pleated
necklace one thick one and then like a
small one with a small little medallion
on the end of it so it's very simple but
I like simple because when you layer it
up together just gives you a lot of
drama so I thought that just is cute now
the next one I got is just basically
like a try necklace set so basically it
comes with three necklace three choker
style necklaces that I thought were so
cute so I'm basically what I'm gonna do
is just kind of chop or do the chokers
two chokers and then wear this and just
kind of find ways to layer the necklace
sets up just because I don't know I just
really like it I kind of feel like that
extra jewelry that extra bling kind of
gives you like a different feel so I'm
trying to do more of that kind of stuff
and I've just really been into that for
the last few months so you guys will see
a lot of this accessory things that I'm
doing it's just crazy alright guys so
the next few things that I got were from
Primark so I'm gonna start off with this
that's three items first for you guys
just so I can get that out the way and
then I'll show you guys the clothes so
the first thing that I got which was a
random thing that I found at the
checkout was this water bottle
now I had like two of them that went
missing and I just cannot seem to find
them I don't know if people are coming
and picking them out from my house or
whatever or my sister's taking or
someone but they're just kind of like
missing so I went purchased this one and
I thought it was really cute simple it
was only like a dollar three it was two
thousand eighty cents well I've never
seen them price something for 280 they
usually do three or something but
whatever so I picked this one
it's very simple just the water bottle
put some water in it holiday so I saw
this up to checkout and I picked this
sweat out because I definitely need to
replace mines now the next thing I got
was just a pair of shoelaces there were
a dollar and I have my Vince are kind of
getting like really dirty but she listed
getting dirty and if you don't like it's
like certain weird dirt spots I don't
like so I was just like you know let me
get a pair of shoelaces just so I can
just chain my shoelaces out these were
done they want to check out so I picked
these one out now the next thing that I
got was this one right here so this is
probably one of my bigger items but it
was kind of the cheapest item it wasn't
a cheapest item overall but cheapest
item as an accessory so this one is a
duffle bag that I picked out now
originally I'm in the beginning of the
season this was priced at $18 and when I
saw for $18 I was like I'm not buying
that for $18 so lucky me this one
actually went on sell for $7 and it's
just one of those nice kind of size
travel bags or kind of like gym bags and
I needed one desperately just in kit
like you know if I'm going to the gym I
have to work I want to have the stuff
prepared in my bag so that when I'm
leaving my job and go to the gym put the
stuff on and get working out this is a
major reason why I procrastinate I go to
the gyms because I don't have a bag I
don't have a plan so I thought I looked
at this and I was like you know what
this is gonna be my plan I'm gonna take
this gym bag and bring it with me to the
to work and then or leave it in my car
and then when it's time for me to go
home I'll stop to the gym and go to the
gym and work out so I've been
procrastinating on my weight loss and
you know stuff like that so I'm trying
to get back into the game hence why I
bought the water bottle and hence why I
got the bag but mainly because this bag
was $7.00 and I was like come on
especially what I'm doing like quick
like getaways quick travel like on the
weekend and stuff like that I definitely
need something you know cute and
fashionable and I can let go along with
it definitely has it has a side strap
too so if you want to put it around you
on the on like hanging on your shoulder
you can it does have it has like one
pocket in the front right here where you
can add your mini items too but mainly
inside is what you're looking for
there's a lot of space inside for you to
add like you could add like a pair of
shoes pair of sandals and like other
stuff that you would need just like
quick items that you would need if
you're going on a vacation or mini vacay
chin or if you're going to the gym so I
definitely thought that this was a great
deal and I think that me and my sister
grabbed the last two that were on the
back I don't even know if anybody else
realized that when I went to check out
the girl was like oh my god this is
seven dollars and I was like yeah so I
thought this was a great deal so the
next thing I picked up were these cute
little running sneakers now I thought
that things were originally priced at
$15 when I got to the register she rang
them out for seven so I don't know if
they had like this major sell when they
were cutting down the prices but I'm not
complaining I was very happy when I saw
that these rang out for $7 so there are
basically red sneakers and I love a
colored sneaker I have vans this color
I've been this color pink like I just I
just love like solid colored sneakers so
I thought that these were cute they look
really simple I don't think that these
are something I would wear in the rain
because I felt the water would just seep
right through them
but as far as kind of wearing them like
to dress up yeah or just wearing them to
the gym maybe but I would mostly I
mostly bought these to dress up with
them kind of wearing dresses and stuff
so I thought that these were really cute
guys and they were priced $7 $7.99 for
$7 listen I'm cheap
and I'm I will go for the $7 any day so
I thought that these were really cute
guys and I got these in a size 8 or 9 I
believe I'm not sure I just rip the tags
off and I haven't even worn these and I
can't wait to wear them we're lied so I
got them in a UK six at a us eight so
they're a size 8 and they fit perfectly
I'm usually a 9 but these ones fit
perfectly so the next thing I got were a
couple B kneecaps they were a dollar
fifty so I picked two I picked a red one
out and I picked a gray one out they're
very simple style beanies I just like
putting these on my head in the winter
time just to style up they're very
simple and if you want to kind of like
you know do the extra make your outfit a
little bit more particular and make it a
little bit more q you can add these I
definitely like wearing this one my
short hair when I wear my natural hair
my naturally is very short so usually
what I'll do is kind of gel it down and
I can mold it until I kind of like a
like overcast kind of
little short hairstyle and then I'll put
like a beanie cap on it with hoop
earrings in that kind of natural beat
and it's just that look for me is like
everything guys especially if you're
like rushing and you don't have time to
put like a wig on and I put the powder
down and I put the baby hairs all up in
and style it I definitely would do that
hairstyle more often in the winter time
just because it's easier for me and it
really looks cute guys would like a
fresh beet and some hooves I should do a
video on that I should I will now the
next thing I got is this really cute I
think you father's a beret I'm not I
don't want to say the wrong thing and
then you guys try to come for me in the
comment session but I don't care so I
think it's called a beret like when will
some French hats and has that little
little peak peak at the top and I
thought it was so cute so this was $6
before I went to Primark I went to
forever 21 and noticed was $15 I was
like 15 dollars for this I'm not paying
$15 for this and I'm like this little
chain design on it I didn't want to
chain I just wanted the hat so I saw
this one for $6 and I picked this out I
thought it was really cute very simple
something to put on your head to style
up be kind of fashionable where you go
on places and stuff like that you know
so I thought it was cute so I picked
this one out and I was like you know I'm
gonna style this up wear it out
I might this weekend I might even go to
the museum I might even do something
different this weekend with my sister if
my boyfriend's working I probably just
hang out with my sister this weekend so
I probably go to the city and put like a
little cute outfit on and like you know
do something fun you know I don't know
I've like all these plans this fall last
fall me and my sister did a lot of stuff
so this farm I'm I'm betting on a lot of
a lot of events and stuff like that so
the next thing I got was just some
undies and I never really showed this
kind of stuff on here but I wanted to
show this cuz I don't know I thought it
was cute so I got these I'm kind of like
silh kind of cheeky style undies now
these are size extra large which
converts into 1416 u.s. they were just
really cute they have like a little lace
trim on it and they're full full
coverage or not thongs cell phone
coverage undies
when you have your best friend on the
monthly which I rarely do because I have
Mirena but just FYI if you you know if
you do and if I case you may spot
through sometimes so I like to our full
coverage full coverage panties so I
thought that these were cute they were
nice style and they have like a little
h-him on the outer edge and they're very
nice and soft so I got them in an
extra-large
I let them nice and comfortable I don't
want to have something too tight on me
leaving those kind of like panty marks
in the back of my jeans or leggings
almost like you know what let me get it
a nice bigger size and you know cover up
this little booty of mine now the next
thing I got are these kind of thong
style kind of like they're kind of like
shapewear style it has like that shaper
of material but they're thongs styled um
briefs or panties thong style undies
yeah so I got this one in a three pack
and it's a size extra large as well
they're not g-string just a regular
thong style they're very comfortable
guys they're really soft material and it
almost reminds me of like shapewear has
that shapewear feel so I just picked
this up because I needed some new ones
and I got them in black so you can never
go wrong with stuff like that so I just
pick three of them so so moving along
guys so I got three clothing items from
Primark they're very simple like I said
when I was rummaging through the items
at the store Billy didn't find a lot of
things that I was crazy for I feel like
more so the accessories and stuff like
that were really booming and popping
this season for me or this AHA that I
did so
sowwy so the first thing I got is a
bubble vest now I love bubble vests
they're very simple and if it's if
you're having like a 60 60 degree day
you don't really necessarily have to
wear a jacket I would say wear a long
sleeve shirt and a bubble fest I always
wear a bubble vest in the winter now I
have a whole bunch of other colors so
this one was the first red one that I
got and it matched my beanie and matched
my sneaker so I was like you know what
it's a great day this is working out so
I picked this one out and I got in a
size large so large converts into well
larges of 1416 UK in a u.s. 1012 so I
thought it was really nice as a very
soft material is it going to be a UH I
kind of what do you go through in a
fleece or whatever that's gonna keep you
extra warm no but it is gonna do what it
needs to do if you were a long-sleeve
shirt on a sixty to sixty degree day
whether it's gonna be fun you'll be fine
it's gonna give you the coverage you
need and it's gonna look cute I thought
it was nice it fits really nice it just
gives me more of an athletic via
let it feel is this come with this
little bag in it I don't even know I
think you can actually like roll this up
and put it in here so it's that super
light packable quilt I don't even know
what that's for but yeah so I thought it
was cute it was nice very comfortable
guys and I think I paid about I believe
this was like fourteen dollars or
something for this one which is perfect
now the next thing I got is very breaker
so I'm gonna just show you guys on the
side so I got this cardigan sweater and
usually I would not pay $18 for
something like this this was I believe
18 or 16 dollars but guys I love it and
I love yellow yellow has been like my
color
I just loved yellow in the summer I
still love yellow till this moment guys
so when I saw and it was like 16 18
dollars and I was like mm I'm not trying
to spend that type of money on this cuz
you know what I mean so when I saw now
is that oh my god it's so nice it feels
very soft guys and the thing was this a
longer sweater and it kind of has like
this curve to it which will really make
you look nice and curved out I don't
know I when I saw and I tried oh no it's
like I have to have this the colors
perfect and I feel like yellow goes for
the season as well so don't be afraid to
wear yellow into the fall it's just
something you can do the leaves got
yellow like you know I'm saying it's
just it's just part of the season I
thought that this was so cute guys it's
very soft I believe I got this one and
let me see I got this one in a size
large which is a US 1012 UK 1416 and
it's absolutely worth it guys they only
have this color if they had more colors
I probably would've picked up a gray one
and a red one as well but this is
definitely one of my fun favorites for
the Fall now the next thing I got is his
dress and I accidentally like put like a
make up put my make up print on the back
of the dress so there's like a small
stain on it
but I do like this dress a lot this was
$14 guys and it's basically like this
gray dress and it has kind of like to
tie up in the front so I got this dress
in a size US 12 which converts into a UK
16 I believe
yep UK 16 now me and my sister were like
we bought the same dress and we're
sitting like oh my god it's kind of big
I don't know if I should size down
I'm not sizing down simply because once
you watch this type of dress it'll
shrink so I got it in size 12 and it's
so comfortable guys
it's it just gives you so much it's like
really comfortable it's like a nice soft
kind of like cotton material and it
looks really good like I feel like with
this like I could wear with those red
sneakers in style it up style it down it
just gives me more solved with athletic
v and it just looks really good so I
picked this one out I highly recommend
if you have a Primark to pick this one
out the vest in this and the cardigan
sweater these were kind of like really
pop and people were like snatching these
off the rack I thought this was really
cute has that really cute bow tie in the
front and I just was feeling it so much
guys
so I highly recommend choosing this one
just wash your hands with your makeup
I'm gonna have to wash this to get that
stain out I kind of like made the sand a
little bit bigger so I'm gonna have to
find a way to get that stain out I have
no idea how that happened but I was
really sad when I tried on and realized
that I had to stand on my booty but
whatever it's still cute guys and I
still alright guys so that basically
wraps up today's Maha video I hope you
guys enjoy the items that I got I'm

clothes that you guys expected to see

shopping I haven't done that in a while

time for myself to do things that I like
