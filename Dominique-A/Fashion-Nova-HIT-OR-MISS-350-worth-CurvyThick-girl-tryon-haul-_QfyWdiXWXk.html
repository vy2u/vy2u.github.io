with another curvy slash stick girl
trying home video so today's video
sponsored from fashion over calm now
they sent me 350 dollars with the items
to review for you guys today so today
I'm going to give you guys my honest
opinion on the clothing items that I got
from them and I'm gonna tell you guys
the items that are hit or miss and
reference to is it worth buying these
items at all now when you're shopping on
fashion over comm it could be really
tricky and really deceiving sometimes
you're clicking pictures and clothes on
a sexy skinny model and then when you
get the item in it looks completely
different
the material is trash or it's just not
what you thought it was gonna be so
today I'm gonna kind of help you guys
and guide you guys through shopping on
fashion over and show you guys the items
that I got and tell you if it's really
worth it or not now you guys are allowed
to leave your comments down below do not
forget to thumbs up this video subscribe
and share this video with your friends
and family and if you're interested in
seeing what I have to offer in today's
drawing hall guys I would like you to
stay tuned and keep on watching alright
guys so the first thing I'm gonna start
off with are some really popular trouser
pants that are like trending everywhere
now the first one I'm gonna show you
guys are the ones with the kind of
snappies on the side these are really
really popular guys they've been
trending girls have been wearing them
with heels and stuff like that body
suits so I saw this on fashion of a
curve so I picked this one out they
didn't have the black ones and they only
have the blue ones so I picked the blue
ones out obviously but they still will
work with black shoes and a white top so
I didn't care I just wanted them cuz
they were nice now I got this in the
curve collection in this size one XL now
I purposely got into one XL because I am
really bottom heavy like my thighs my
butt and I didn't want this to be too
tight on me I wanted it to have more
soul of a loose kind of fit so I got
these and I think is that price pretty
well now it's a really good material
these are not thin at all so they're
really thick and nice it does have the
palpable leg more palpable sides all the
way down so if you're really trying to
take your clothes off quick you just
have to go like this and pop these off
and they come right off they're really
really stylish thighs I would wear this
with a crop top maybe some heels
any type of way cuz you know I like to
switch my wigs up I thought that this
was really nice guys and I will honestly
say that this is worth it if you're
trying to be really if you're trying to
step up your trends and trying to you
know give yourself more of an edgy look
this will definitely work I like this a
lot you can wear this with sandals heels
or sneakers but I would say heels will
actually look really cute with this one
like if you're going like to like a
brunch or a rooftop little get-together
something like that this would be really
really cute so I got another pair
similar to that one now this one's
different because this one doesn't have
this snappa both sides this one is just
a regular old high waisted wide leg
pants now this one I think I'm into the
price and I will link everything down
below this one is $25 guys now this one
I actually prefer the other one better
than this one I feel like with this one
it's kind of like any type of wide leg
pants so it's not really that special
but I liked it because of the coloring
so these are black but on the side you
get this really cute kind of fake Gucci
inspired a pattern which is green and
red I thought this was really cute
against the black and they are wide leg
trousers as well but these for me come
up a little bit too short on the ankle
so you definitely what I would
definitely recommend wearing these with
heels because they come like they just
they needed to hit the floor a little
bit for me i'm 5-4 so i feel like it
could have hit like a little bit lower
on the floor they are really cute though
i got this one in a size 1x as well they
do fit with these if you're having like
not a small waist for a waist that's
smaller than the bottom half of your
body i would say get at 1x XL but i want
to be more comfortable so I chose the 1x
instead just for comfort just to be
comfortable what was I gonna even say
but yeah just to be comfortable so I
think these are cute or for $25 not too
bad not too bad so these two pants are
definitely a plus right here
moving along guys so the next thing I
got the next two items that were two
piece sets now I've been really into the
two piece set slightly just because it's
approaching like the colder season soon
like next week is like I mean I'm 90 for
next week tomorrow that's 64 degrees so
it's kind of like getting into the kind
of colder weather or kind of like
seasonally Pleasant weather that's what
I should say so I was trying to find two
pieces that would be really good for the
transition and when it does get a little
bit colder something you can put on
really quick and go so the first thing I
got is really popular and I see a lot of
people wearing this and I actually got
this from another company before and the
size was way smaller than what I thought
I could even fit my leg in one of them
so I found on fashion Ava's website so I
chose this one now this is a size 1x and
it's the coat in the bottom well like
the little jacket in the bottom and it's
just nice velvety little tracksuit thing
now this is really really popular I see
a lot of people wearing the pink one but
I wanted the blue because blue to me
looks really cute and cool and the way I
styled in this video I thought it was so
cute with the sports bra the hoop
earrings hair back and tuck me how my
answers just thought it was so so fab
so I really was like carried away with
this one a lot this one does come with
kind of like the strings to kind of
tighten it this fits perfect for me guys
like I said I'm bottom heavy so this one
fit my thighs and my butt really good it
doesn't have stretch on it so if you are
heavier than we have a definitely
recommend sizing up I'm not even sure if
they have it in a size extra large so I
just went straight to the 1x like I said
guys I'm always about being comfortable
I do not want to be really tight and
like you know like stuffed up this
winter I want to be kind of loose and
free and my clothes a little bit so I
wanted to I'm sizing up and I size up on
this one and I'm happy because had I got
to extra-large
I'd have been looking like a stuffed
sausage pack and I'm just not going for
that right now so I'm happy that I sized
up it's really cute it's kind of like a
windbreaker type of material if you can
hear it the jacket is cute the jacket
I'm not gonna lie the jacket is could
have been smaller it's a little bit big
so the jacket I could have gotten an
extra large in the bottom I would have
stuck with the 1x because like I said to
you guys I'm bottom having my top is a
little bit smaller than my bottom so
ratio-wise I'm small at the top and then
a little bit bigger at the bottom so the
jacket I could have the got a size extra
large but they just keep it in the set
you buy the set 1 set 1 X so couldn't
really change that but I still like you
guys I do kind of leave mines open you
can wear it with like a tank top sports
bra or whatever and just give it kind of
like an extra edge to it make it a
little bit more sexy so this one I
definitely will recommend getting I
think that this
is worth it if you're somebody that
likes to dress up and dress down you've
been tough to get away we're wearing
four furry slides with this one sneakers
heels etc etc this one Debbie can go
really broad during the autumn and
winter season so I definitely think that
this is a definite hit now this two
piece that I got guys is kind of
different no I got this one in the
actual regular size they had this one as
size extra large I wish that this was a
size 1x and I'm gonna tell you guys why
now it is from the top fits good the top
is very stretchy it's it's like a nice
cotton textile material and I can't even
get this okay what the hell come on like
work with me work with me so this is
definitely like a nice cotton material
it's really cute it's like a Bardot top
and it has like those kind of hanging
sleeves the reason why I chose this was
because I like the pattern and I was
like you know the pattern is pretty I
was planning on going on vacation in
December but the plans got ruined
because of the Hurricanes and send your
praise out there to anyone who lives in
the areas where the hurricane devastated
you I'm sorry I'm keeping in my prayers
and everything but I was supposed to go
on the trip and that guy ruin all the
Caribbean islands practically got ruined
so I'm not going to any of that so I'm
trying I'm gonna have to wear this for
Valentine's Day because I do mean my
boyfriend tend to go away valentines day
just as a treat so for Valentine's Day
we're planning to go to Aruba so I
probably wear this when I go to real but
just because it's gamal too cool for
this but now this suit together was
39.99 hmm
now this will be the first one I he'll
let you guys know I could have went
without this one I could have done
without this one for $40 No now it's
cute but four in size extra large then
what they do with the pants is really
annoying they put the stretchy as part
of the pants in the back why wouldn't
you just make the whole entire waist of
stretch band now and this is a problem
area people usually have a problem area
in the front so the front has absolutely
no stretching is just like a hard
material front so kind of like divides
your stomach up and gives you more of a
defined muffin which we're really
pissing me off I just didn't like that
about it it's really cute not if I do a
couple crunch
and kind of get my stomach to flatten up
a little bit and kind of like cut off my
pooch down there maybe this would be
really cute but I just feel like this
band right here should have been elastic
all the way through and if you know what
I'm talking about guys if your comments
down below like I hate when companies do
that just make it an elastic band waist
all the way through do not make this
part non stretchy that's the worst part
to make a non stretchy and they did that
with this one not for $40 absolutely not
I would not buy this for $40 to be
honest with you guys that's just my
honest opinion it's cute and all but
I've seen cuter cheaper and more
reasonably made items that are better
than this it is cute though it does have
like that kind of like wide leg
appearance and the bottom has that cute
design that the sleeves have on the top
it's a cute concept cute style but the
way they constructed this one is not
good for the curves so if you are
skinnier and you don't have like a nice
stomach pooch or you don't have all the
extra bodies and this will work for you
but for people who are on a curved thick
side or plus-sized not know this is not
gonna work at all so the next two items
I got guys they're kind of the same
category kind of same color scheme and
they definitely are jumpsuits now this
one I got this is the first one that I'm
gonna show you now I like this one a lot
and I seen other people review this one
as well so in the beginning I looked at
I was like you know maybe this is gonna
work maybe it's not gonna work a lot of
people complain about the pant leg being
like really really long and really
really wide now it's gonna be funny when
I explain this to you guys but I didn't
have that same experience just because
my thighs swallowed up the material so I
didn't have kind of like long pant leg
so my thigh swallowed it up scrunch it
up and it was just kind of like okay
this will be just bell-bottom pants and
that's it but this is really cute guys I
initially didn't like it because I feel
like this material will make you look
really fat well not really fat it make
you look fatter than what you are and
I've been told on here in the comments
that I'm fat so um this material
definitely generate a lot of cellulite
and you know a lot of exposure of
dimples and stuff like that but if
you're someone like me who doesn't care
you can get away with this one and make
it look really nice
now I think it's a cool concept in the
beginning when you put this on there's a
lot of strapping in it so it's really
confusing so what I would say is before
you put this on kind of figure out where
the straps go I kind of had a hard time
figuring out where these straps went but
once I put it on I had my sister assist
me with zipping in the back and stuff
like that because where the waist comes
in at it gets really really tight and
it's really really hard to zip up right
where the waist is at but once you put
this on with a nice weave a nice makeup
look and just like really really like
nice gold heels maybe or something
really simple it would actually be a
really cute outfit I would say that I
would wear this one for New Year's or
something like that I wouldn't wear this
like if I'm going to the club or
something is just not a club look like
but if you're going to like it like nice
occasion maybe like a baby shower or
something and it's a baby girl it'll be
something cute to wear
I just I think it's really cute it's
just that if you're someone that's kind
of like cautious about your body you
don't want people to see like your lumps
and dumps and stuff like that then I
don't recommend buying this one now this
one is priced at let's see
$34.99 and this is a size extra large it
is a bit tight so I could have gotten it
1x in this one but the extra large kind
of gives me more of a good like feel
good comfort so I'm happy with the extra
large but if you want to I definitely
recommend sizing up so that you kind of
have a little bit of wiggle room in the
waist area because it does get really
tight now $34.99 that's a little bit
steep for this one so I might recommend
maybe not purchasing this if you ain't
got the coins but if you're going on
fashion oh but you want to blow your
money up or blow your money one shot
then maybe get this but if I was buying
this by myself I would not buy this for
$34.99 this should be like $24.99 $34.99
is a bit excessive to me for this
it's Cuban ah but it's not that cute
honestly and truly believe it comments
down below and some what you think now
the next one I'm gonna show you guys
it's kind of like what do you call this
it's more of like a velvety suit and a
lot of the things I got here are either
velvet or satin so my whole haul is kind
of like
and items all the items but these are
actually trending right now so I kind of
feel like I'm on point right now so this
one is cute guys I got this one in a
size 1x now I'm gonna say this for this
outfit and another just I'm gonna show
you the the cleavage part is way too low
I know some people are okay with wearing
their cleavage you're very very low to
their belly button like that but I just
feel like that's a little too much so I
ended up having to go in with my needle
and thread and closing these up a little
bit so I did go in and close this one up
just because it is way too low for me
and it's kind of almost in a way
inappropriate I know like you doesn't
like inappropriate but like you get what
I'm saying like it's just kind of like
close it up a little bit and then the
opteka turn into an outfit that can be
worn during the daytime you feel me
so I definitely close this up and it's
really cute though it's a mauve color I
could have got this one in a size extra
large but 1x is always my safe zone I
just like to do 1x just in case because
if you get an extra large and it's too
tight you're kind of out of luck so
I got a 1x in this one it has a nice
little belt and it's kind of like it
stops like right below your ankles it's
really cute it has a bell and I wrapped
it around twice and then brought it up
to the front to give me like a nice
little cinched in waist it is a very
soft material and this one is priced at
$27.99 now this is price good I feel
like that price the price for this one
for a jumpsuit is it's pretty well
priced versus of $34.99 for that one but
the $27.99 for this one I don't think I
would pay that either
I would actually pick the other one over
this one for that for the $34.99 for
that one over the $27.99 this one is
definitely I'll work $27.99 but like I
said if you're going on the website and
you got money and you're trying to blow
it up on the website then go ahead and
purchase this but for $27.99 it's a no I
would purchase this for $19.99 honestly
and truly $19.99 for this one
the other one should have been $24.99
but fashion oh but they love doing that
they love doing the $34.99 $27.99 like
why just make the price more reasonable
but this is cute guys and I do like
these kind of blush pink colors
especially for the fall season I just
think it looks really cute and you know
good on the skin alright so the next two
things I'm gonna show you guys guys are
some dresses
so I got two addresses from them I
actually got three but I misplaced one
of the dresses and I have no idea where
it's at and I'm really sad about that I
wish I know where was that I think I
left it at my boyfriend's apartment I'm
not even sure but I'll add it into
another try and haul for you guys just
because I love you
now this first dress I'm gonna show you
guys I'm gonna tell you guys straight
off the bat it's a note for me I just
this is on the model on the website he
looked so much different different and
the model that try this on she was
actually plus-sized so in my head I'm
thinking like okay it's gonna fit me a
little bit longer it's not gonna be that
much mmm I can't guys so this is another
one that I had to go in and sew in a
little bit closer in the front they make
the dips in or like the plunge and this
one way too too long I just kind of feel
like that shouldn't be that long I mean
like come on seriously so I went in with
my needle thread and kind of closed this
one up a little bit now the reason why I
got this one is because I like the color
the material is very nice it's a nice
kind of like micro is that what it is it
is that's like a micro fiber micro fill
it whatever you know what I'm talking
about that type of material so it's
really really nice and soft it's not
cotton it's like that fake cotton no it
has a cute little slit in it which I
like but the dress is it's too short
it's just way too short now I got this
in the size extra large and this one is
$29.99 guys $29.99 for this one isn't no
$24.99 okay but the dress is too short I
honestly would not wear this outside
I don't club like that anymore so where
am I gonna wear this - I would never
embarrass my boyfriend by going out with
it with him in this type of dress
because it's just too short
it's the slit it's just like it's like
I'm going out there to expose my entire
self especially before I cover it up the
really low deep it deep cut it would
have been too much it's like where are
you going with this like if I was going
to Vegas and I was going to a strip club
maybe I would wear this or like some
type of really raunchy type of scenery
but I don't really do that anymore I'm
kind of like more of a homebody and
hubby and wifey body right now so I
don't really do stuff like this anymore
I
chose this thinking that it was gonna be
different but it's not it's just way too
way too way too short way too skimpy for
me and for 29.99 it's a no I'm not going
to buy this with $29.99 I just I
couldn't I can fathom spending that much
money on a dress like this now this
dress on the other hand is very very
cute and I like it a lot it does have a
low boob area but with this one you can
adjust the straps to make it more
friendly and for certain occasions and
stuff now this one is cute and this one
is $19.99 in size extra large
now this one is reasonably priced it's a
really nice red colored dress definitely
perfect for Thanksgiving holiday seasons
Christmas or whatever it definitely will
be a really nice dress to wear now with
this one being kind of it does have a
little explosion in the breast area
putting a nice little kind of furry
jacket like a short crop furry jacket
over and some heels will be so cute guys
and I would definitely wear this to like
a Christmas or like a holiday party or
something like that nothing too crazy it
this kind of like this ruching in the
middle so you can actually adjust at the
bottom to kind of make it tighter it's
really really cute it is a bit of a thin
material so if you're gonna wear
shapewear and stuff like that worse
shape or this time is seamless
I work shapewear but my shapewear rose
up right in my fat pocket in the back so
it kind of gave me more of a kind of
divider I didn't I wore like the pan
shaper and that I featured in one of my
videos before but I thought this was
cute just wear that seamless shapewear
will be really nice with this one and
like I said wearing one like a nice cute
little furry jacket and stuff like that
would be so cute so I'm definitely gonna
be on the look for something like that
for my fall looks and stuff like that
but I thought this was cute for $19.99
this is definitely a good dress they
have this in a variety of clothes I
think I had in green black 10 which were
really good colors so I picked the red
one just because I was thinking more of
fall so I thought this was excellent so
the last clothing item I got is this
really cute distressed denim jacket now
I got this one and a size 1x now this is
oversized for me but I was tech I was
definitely going for that look I
absolutely love this longline jean
jacket now you guys know I did I showed
one of these in my last try on haul and
wanted to get another one just because
I'm obsessed the last one I showed you
guys from where it all was a darker
color this one's more so of a lighter
gene color and it is so freakin cute
guys I absolutely absolutely love this
one so much guys
it's really really nice a very soft
material it does have like that total
distress effect which is really nice
all the way around and the thing that
really sold me about this one is that
the bottom of the jacket the actual
bottom of the jacket is kind of like a
frayed hem as like afraid hemline is
that what you call has like a frayed
hemline I would say I hope I'm saying
the right thing but you guys know what
I'm talking about but I thought this was
so cute guys now like I said I got in a
size 1x so it's a bit Spacey but it's
something you could wear with like a
nice tight body con dress and sneakers
or know of fashion over track suit and
sneakers you guys know me and my
sneakers I am gonna do a shoe huh I've
been I've been thinking about that
lately cuz I do have some collaborations
coming up with some shoe companies some
mmm so it would be nice to do some shoe
hauls to and you know more look books
come on people you know so yeah but I do
like this one and this one guys is
$44.99 now let's get into the verdict
right now $44.99 fashion OVA do you
really think it should have been $44.99
now it is nice it's almost kind of like
a blazer or a duster style because it is
long I mean it spills pasture but but
$44.99 you could have came down to
$34.99 and I know you guys probably that
girl shut up with this you're decreasing
the thing about $5 or $10 but honestly
that 5 or $10 makes a huge difference in
your pockets especially for something
like this don't get me wrong it's really
cute and I also want to mention too this
is meant to this to you guys when you're
buying in the curve collection for my
curvy plus-sized they do kind of bump
the price up I don't know if anyone
noticed that I'm pretty sure from my
memory that they bumped the price up
just by a few more dollars so keep that
in mind too so $44.99 I kind of thought
they could've came with a $39.99 above
it 5 $39.99 or maybe even like I said
$34.99 but it is really cute and if you
want something like they
so you're looking for a nice long jean
jacket to style up um I would get this
like this is this is Stephanie at guys I
really really like this a lot it's you
can do so much with this oh god I love
it so much guys so I would definitely
say that this is a success right here it
is steep but like I said if you want if
you want to do if you want to get
something nice I would sacrifice some
money for this one but they should lower
it down to 39 89
lastly guys the only thing accessory
wise or she wise that I got from them
are these babies right here so last
season these were really trending kind
of like those nice gold style shoes now
I've already worn these ones I did a
surprise birthday dinner for my
boyfriend's 27th birthday so I popped
these babies on for the evening now they
are pretty comfortable actually were
these mostly the whole night they are
chunky style wet heels so therefore
you're not gonna have too much of a
painful night out like I told you guys I
don't want like that anyways anymore so
if I'm going to dinner something like
that I'm trying to be cute I'll wear
these but these are really cute guys I
got these in a size 9 which is my
regular size one thing I'm gonna say to
you guys is the part right here the
strap part your toes will definitely
crunch up here you do have a night a lot
of space in this area so it fits but
they make this one tight and I kind of
see why they would do that when they
make this area tight it'll keep a little
bit more support so that your toe is
sitting nice and tight in that area
you're not having a like a lot of moving
around shifting in a pain cuz when your
shoe is loose that's when your foot were
really really hurt so I do appreciate
that they made this area a little bit
tighter for me or for everyone but I do
think these are cute and like I love
