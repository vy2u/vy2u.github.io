channel today so today it's going to be
another Kirby slash big girl China now
today's video I'll be showing you guys
some jeans from fashion over comm so
today's video I'm going to kind of show
you guys how I kind of get that small
waist big booty look so and today's that
I'm going to show you guys how I get
those books together now there's two
items that I usually use when it comes
to having pants that are too big or kind
of like I want to get that smooth look
so my pants are too big and a lot of
spacing in the back of the front I
always use like a belt to kind of close
it in a little bit and I don't use like
a big dog I use that kind of little
skinny belt because the skinny belt kind
of accentuates the waist and makes you
look a little bit more curvier and
leaner so that's one of my tricks now
the second thing I use is kind of one of
those zip up waist trainers or corsets
now you can use like the regular waist
trainer but I try not to use that one
because the boning really hurts number
one and the boning is exposed
now the zip up one is undetectable so
you can't see that one so I usually get
away with that a lot unfortunately the
one that I have right now is a little
bit too small for me so I'm trying to
squeeze myself in there with my little
fat pedals hanging on the back but it is
what it is I'm going to weight-loss
journey so you guys will see the results
soon so stay tuned for a weight loss
video if you're interested in that but
for today's purposes I will show you
guys all the jeans that I got and how I
achieved that little coke bottle shaped
look that kind of slim stick sticky
dik-dik look so if you're interested in
seeing what I have to offer today I
would like you to stay tuned and keep on
watching right guys so the first two
jeans I'm going to start off with other
jeans that I got from the regular size
collection now both of these jeans are
black and then the size 15 so the first
one that I'm going to show you is one
that I really like now these are so cute
and they're very fashionable so this one
kind of has like the crisscross design
all the way down and it does have the
strings at the bottom of the pant so
therefore if you want to tighten it you
can but if you don't tiny do get a
little bit of die exposure which I
really like
now these fit perfect they are like true
size 15 and they're it's very stretchy
so if you are you can size down if you
want or you can just keep it at the
won't get the size I see but they're
really stretchy they do make the book
look good and these
one of my favorite genes very in style
and they actually look really good with
a period he'll do and the outfit that I
tried this on with just went so well
together and I think that this is
definitely one of those outfits I wear
if I'm going out like it is just really
bitchin
now the next pair of jeans that are
these other black distressed jeans now I
love distressed jeans but I don't have a
black pair of distressed Jean so I
wanted to get these now these are
effective teen and these are a little
big but they're fit fine and it's a
really good material stretch their
distress all the way down to the leg and
it does have a little zip pockets in the
front part right here which I think it's
cute for design I think that was nice
that they did that the back explain is
no distress on the back these fit good
just like the other black jeans it does
have a great stretch and these look
really good as well too and this is just
something you've just drawn and you kind
of style the way you do usually with
these high-waisted jeans I usually wear
body suits and sometimes I wear crop
tops tile and depends how I'm feeling on
this particular two pair of jeans are
ducks
now the next two pair of jeans are kind
of similar in color and a little bit
similar in style but there's just a
little minor things that are different
so the first I'm going to show you are
these that are kind of distressed kind
of like randomly it's like one little
distressed pattern here one at the
kneecaps and one at the lower leg now
these are kind of plain and they're kind
of like a darker wash Jean and I'm not
used to wearing too much of a dark wash
G and I like kind of like a light wash
these are size 1x and they fit perfect I
just like these just because they're
playing don't have they're kind of like
middle like middle it fits so you say
they're kind of really plain and simple
where you can style them up for me like
I said I just use you wear a body suit
crop top or just a t-shirt and tuck it
in because these are high waisted they
do figure they have an amazing stretch
and their size one XL I definitely like
these now the next one I got is just the
same color they have an amazing stretch
as well to guys and I think that these
these ones are actually one of my
favorites from the two out of the two
now this one just has the knee cap cuts
and I love a knee cap cut it just looks
really good
these would look good with some nice
kind of like maybe like beige heels or
like something even sandals will be nice
they're skinny leg jeans these are size
1x and
look these look excellent guys I just
really really like these a lot
now for this one like I said salad just
simply I put a belt on and most of these
garments I'm showing most of these pants
on and show you guys I do work kind of
like my um my trainer my zip up trainer
so it just helps me smooth out and give
myself more delusion of that coke bottle
shape so I definitely utilize that in
some of these outfits today and I just
think that this one is one of my
favorites guys along with the black
jeans with the kind of a crisscross
design so this is definitely a must and
it just fits really really nice now
these jeans right here I'm going to
single these out just because these were
a little bit strange for me now I did
get these in the size 15 a while ago
before I started doing fashion over
Tryon house or sponsored ones and I got
these in the center see and I had a hard
time putting them on just for the simple
fact that they didn't fit on my thighs
now these are stretchy like really
stretching these are size 1x now these
are the dark wash jeans that they have
just like those really plain ones and
they have them in light wash and these
are kind of the popular ones that
everyone purchases when they long
fashion over comm now I went to the
plus-size section got the 1x I wish that
the company sold these in size
extra-large because I feel like the
waist is way too big like I just have
like like it just gives me a big Fupa
it just is just like it's just like way
too big on the front on the top part the
part that I had a problem with the 15s
with the thigh part now the thigh part
is very stretching it as well but so
when it comes to like the waist part it
is extremely big so what I did for this
one is um I used like a plaid shirt to
turn against my ways to kind of give me
that more of that cinched in look that
would help if you have jeans that are
way too big it really helps pull the
outfit together and pull you in to make
you look a little bit more structured if
I did have that would be really hard to
rock these just because there is just
their look too big in the waist even I
don't know it's just too big in the way
for me but it's crazy because the bottom
the leg part fits perfect it's just that
the waist part is just being you guys
mentioned before my last video you can
get the pin started I probably get these
done like that just because it's kind of
hard to deal with bike pants like this
when they're tubing in the way so like I
said adding like
the tie around your waist definitely
helps give you more of a physique you
know what I mean but these are cute
though I love the color our gravity just
gets them darted or I probably just keep
stung it with like a plaid shirt around
my waist and just kind of doing that
look so but these are really nice guys
and they are very popular no these jeans
right here are Marin next pair jeans oh
these are my favorite jeans these are
size 1x
and don't worry guys I will linked on
everything down below for you guys if
you guys are interested in these pants
so everything signs and all will be
listed down below so if I forgot to say
something and probably pop up down here
or it'll be listed down below now these
are my favorites too now these are
really distressed guys and the thing
that sold me about these is the
distressed is on the bottom ankle part I
just think that these pants are so so
cute well I am turning orange right now
what's going on guys what's going on but
these are really cute and these fit very
well guys these are size 1x and they
just kind of fit so perfect like I
didn't have any trouble style knees I
just use the buff to kind of cinch my
waist and then I did going to use kind
of like my waist my zip up waist of
course that trainer thing to kind of
give me that more of that tight smooth
slick body pop and kind of look so I
definitely these right here are these
are in like these are these are
absolutely and the distressing on these
are amazing it's definitely sexy I would
definitely wear this with like heels
just go okay guys so the last pair pants
that I got are these bell-bottoms are in
Spanish pants now these are really nice
guys these are size 1x for these I also
do wish that these came in a size extra
large is because these are a little bit
big on the waist as well and the thigh
part was a little bit big surprisingly
now I just like the bell bottom look
it's really 70's and 70s it's coming
back so it's like a nice wide leg bell
bottom sauce pan now it does come with
buttons all up the front right here
which i think is really cute it does
kind of give you more of a pull and kind
of brings you in a lot so I thought that
these are really cute now these are
actually popular for the season right
now so you definitely get away with a
lot of like hippie inspired looks and
stuff like that with those pants so I
definitely would wreck
looking for those jeans on fashionable
cuz they are really popular and they do
sell out that and that basically wraps
up this video guys I hope you guys enjoy
the Jean selections that I chose for
this video I'm very happy with the
products that I got sent to me some of
the jeans I do have to go back and kind
of fix or get kind of like tailored or
whatever you want to call it started I
think but I'm very happy thus far I
