today with another hair of you
so obviously I'm just like really glam
right now and I'm really really feeling
it so I definitely kind of had like a
Valentine's Day vibe in my head when I
was kind of recording this video so I
try to add some pieces into this video
to kind of give you guys the feeling by
adding this cute little robot from
Primark and it's cute and a necklace
from fashion Nova so I'll link those
down below if you guys are interested in
buying some of these items now this way
guys this from devil leaf wig calm now
this is your 360 body wave textured unit
now I receive this in a twenty inch and
the cap size about average cap size now
a lot of people ask me what the cap size
don't let explaining to you guys now I
have kind of like an in-between head so
my head can either be small it can't
even be big so I have like a small head
so when I get my cat my wigs I usually
pick it like a medium or small just to
be careful now even when I've gotten
small units they fit my head perfectly
but I wanted to be really careful and
safe with this unit so I got this one in
a medium cap size now if you have a
bigger head guys remember just get
yourself a large or even if you get a
medium you can except the straps are
kind of like not too tight or kind of
placed in a perfect position you'll be
fine with that
so with this unit guys it didn't I have
to put a elastic in on it I didn't have
to glue it down or anything like that so
the unit fit my head precisely guys like
all I did was just glue like a little
bit of baby hairs down and not even cool
just cut a baby hair magicked it up and
that was that now I did adjust the
straps in the back so it's pretty secure
obviously I could take it off and put it
on the next day which is a plus as well
too now I just went in with my powder
guys put some powder on there gave it a
little bit of a realistic vibe I did go
ahead and put the baby here it's
underneath the bank but I kind of
thought after like there was no point in
me doing that now I know you guys want
to ask me about the kind of bang I did
not cut the hair in the front the only
side that I cut was this side here just
because I wanted to give it more of a
little bit of a layered kind of like
elevated look so I did go in with my
hairspray and spray it in I use the
aussies instant freeze so is how what it
is whatever so I just kind of sprayed it
just to give myself a little bit more of
a lift on this side just so it kind of
looked more elegant oh my I really like
this here
I really feel this hair so freakin much
is so cute now I did go in and do a kind
of like a sweet bang now my method of
doing the sweet bang is a little bit
different I don't cut it what I do is
curl the hair backwards so that when it
does fall forward it falls forward is
more of like a cascading bang so
therefore it looks more kind of like
soft and natural I do that all the time
with my hair when I want to do kind of
like long curls or kind of like big nice
wide curls fat voluptuous curls I
usually do that and it kind of worked
really nice with this hair guys the hair
is super duper soft guys and it
definitely has like this really nice
luster to it I really really like this a
lot and I'm not just gases company up
like it took me like lessoning out not
even like 30 minutes just to kind of
wrap this up I did curl it off the
camera a little bit and showed you guys
a little bit of my curls on camera so
you guys can see how well curled the
hair is super super soft guys I got it
when I was straight in the body wave
texture and all I did was just curl on
top of the body wave texture so it
definitely has like more volume so I'm
definitely liking this guys I will leave
all the information down below if you're
interested in purchasing this unit or
any unit from this company if I did not
mention it does have about four inches
of parting space in the front then about
two in the back which is your standard
360 wig now you guys know how I am with
360 wigs either will be my pony tail wig
my bun wig or just be a wig I do
appreciate the bigger parting sweets in
the front so I definitely utilize a lot
of the 360s for that purpose just
because it's a lot of parting space but
guys I do like this I'm really feeling
this Valentine's Day 5 it's kind of like
a get sexy kind of look like you know it
gives me like a real sexy sultry adult
type of look and you guys did say that
you guys love my makeup look and
Glastron haul I did so I wanted to come
back today and show you guys the makeup
look so it's really nothing because I
really don't do that much but you guys
like my eyes and my eyes are blue
they're marble gray now marble grade
there
yeah marble grade contact lenses from
panas cocom along with the blue eyeliner
on the bottom and blue mascara toppled
with black mascara and a little bit
black liner on the edge so I kind of do
like a mix I just think the bull and
bull on contrast against my skin looks
really cool so I hope you guys
appreciate that leave a comment
