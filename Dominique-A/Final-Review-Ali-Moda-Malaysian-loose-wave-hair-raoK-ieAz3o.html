and get this video out just because it's
been a while and this is just an update
for the Alamodome Malaysian loose wave
there and today was just a good hair day
for the hair as you guys can tell the
hair has looks different I have cut the
hair it's been approximate like two or
three months since I've having hair and
I want it to wear for a longer time so I
can give you guys a good definitive
review on the hair and basically I like
the hair guys but the problem with the
hair obviously I had to cut it is that
the hair sheds a lot I'm not sure if
it's because I processed the hair or
whatever whatever whatever it is that I
did to the hair that has caused it to
shed this much but it shed so much guys
it still looks pretty full and it does
look really really nice what a good deep
conditioning has done this hair very
well and I'm not sure if it's because I
overlapped the processing time or
whatever it was but I know when you guys
sit here and look at me you guys are
kind of like oh my god the hair looks
nice but honestly and truly I did have a
lot of problems when it came to shedding
and that was really frustrating with
this hair because it's really nice hair
and the processing and coloring that I
did on the hair is really nice but I
don't want to keep walking around with
strands of hair just sliding out of my
head it just looks crazy so I kind of
don't really wear the hair every single
week and if I do wear it I wear it out
to like an occasion that the style like
this would look very nice so I just
don't worry like every single day I wear
the unit maybe like two three days in a
week or maybe like one whole week and
maybe like one day when I just feel like
putting it on just because the shedding
and I thought that it was it's not it
was kind of more so in the beginning
just kind of like clippings like split
ends but now I'm pulling hair and it's
like full strand shedding coming out and
I just don't know why that's happening I
was saying my C on the west but I
already created the wig so I'm not
sealing wept on the wig or anything like
that it's already done for but what I
will suggest for you guys is if you guys
buy this hair make sure you seal the
West and also make sure you watch your
processing time when it comes to
bleaching the hair I do not do
and I just actually just looked just
waited to one bundle that light and then
proceeded on to the next bundle and then
that's what I got but I wished it was
like some magical like kind of treatment
for here that sheds
I know it's virgin here it's not my real
hair whatever I need not even burns
anymore cuz I dyed it but I know that
it's not really hair real hair anymore
um so it's kind of like it's done for
but I still still wear it guys the
shedding to me is just a problem with
this hair it does kind of give you that
kind of mat up in the back sometimes
when you have like a jacket on
I do use argan oil to kind of tame it
down a little bit so it doesn't look so
you you know like that but I do really
like this hair guys and I the thing I
like about the hair is I like the style
I like the color and I like the look
even when I cut it it just looks so much
better in the hair it's kind of like
this really cute kind of like blondie
ginger tone I don't know it's like a
like a really cool blonde ginger tone so
I really really like the hair so I'm
like determined to keep wearing this wig
but minimally wear it instead of wearing
it kind of more like an everyday wig or
something like that so yeah I would say
that the hair quality per say when I got
it before I dyed it was good I didn't
really wear it when it was just this
natural color so I can't really give you
like a definitive definitive review on
that because I dyed it like the day
after I got it so I would suggest you
look at other videos on this hair type
the Malaysian loose way from Ali moto
just to see what it's like if you just
keep it in that restraint steak but for
me I did process two here so this is the
results I got from processing the hair I
met have just been a bad experience for
me and I know some people think that
youtubers get here and set for free and
they get the best hair well obviously I
didn't get so lucky guys and I'm just
giving you guys my honest review I
wouldn't even life I got it like the
best quality air this is just a raw true
review about the hair and so far I mean
I'm gonna rock what I'm gonna try my
hardest to keep it from shedding or do
whatever I can to keep it and it's good
graces it looks good I know you guys are
probably thinking oh my god that really
sucks because in here looks good
but the fact of the matter is the
shedding is it's crazy like it's just
really crazy I really have to vacuum my
carpet like all the time and like I just
cannot wear the wig when I'm preparing
food
anything because I'm afraid like a
little pieces gonna slide off the phone
to the so they dinner like it's just
it's bad but other than that yeah so I
would write this here probably like a
five and I know that sounds bad I know
it because I process it I'm saying that
but I just don't really like the quality
ver of the hair I mean I just don't feel
like it should be shedding this much but
hey so you can check out all the
reviewers from Ali Mona's Malaysian
loose wave if you're interested in this
hair this is just my review on it I just
wanted to give you guys the heads up on
my hair and how I perceive it I am still
gonna wear this and I'm gonna try to do
my hardest to kind of like tame down the
shedding and it is what it is it still
looks really good guys and it's still
semi full it's one extent so I'm gonna
still try to keep rocking this here cuz
I like it and yeah so leave all your
comments down below guys as usual and
make sure you thumbs up this video and I
will catch you guys in later video bye
