and I'm stopping by today to do my final
review on my virgin brazilian body wave
hair that I purchased from Aliexpress
calm and the company was new start hair
company and I had the hair in for about
three months I had two 26 inch bundles
one 20 inch bundle one 24 inch and one
22 inch bundle and the first four
bundles that I bought I bought a 14 20
22 and 24 I got it for a one hundred
eighty seven thousand fifteen cents I
believe and the last two 26 inch bundles
I bought for $126 the 14th bundle I used
that I gave that away to my sister as I
mentioned in my last two videos of the
hair itself so all together had five
bundles complete and it also had a
closure I what do you see half didn't
begin a I put three bundles in my hair
then I went and I put four bundles in my
hair and I took one of the older bundles
out so from the last video that you saw
I had to I had to 26-inch bundles
124 and 122 inch bundle and then I had
the closure on the top I've been getting
a lot of comments about the closure so I
want to show you guys how I did the
closure the closure was the elastic band
method and this closure like I said is
from heavily in here and you can see
this closure I had it for a while so
it's been through hell and back so this
is what the closure looks like I just
attached a elastic band to the side of
the rim right here
and this elastic this band is actually
from a dome cap I just got it off of a
dome cap I cut off the edge of a dome
cap because it's elastic II and I just
attached it to the side of this and this
is a sublease closure like I said you
can tell cuz if you parked in here at
down you won't see the pattern if the
closure is not bleached or the closure
not bleached when you party down you can
see the parting in the back but this is
silk base closure
Jessen see very sturdy and it's good you
can see the parting on the front it's
not that bad it's been through hell and
back so you know I've been wearing this
a lot but someone asked me a question
about that so this is how I do the last
tube and method and I just you know it's
very tight and secure and make sure I
don't really tight so that when I put on
my head it fits perfectly so this is the
closure and I've layered it off I've cut
I've did everything to it to match the
style to design hairstyle
I want it so this is what I was using
guys for all you guys don't want it to
know and I did get some comments people
say that I look unnatural but I mean it
is what it is I liked in a lot of other
people like this so so one person's
comments not going to discourage me from
wearing the closure I'm gonna wear
whatever I want I mean I love this
closure I mean I try to apply it the
best way I can I'm not a professional so
to some people may look unnatural to
some people may look natural but to me
it looked perfectly fine so that's all
that matters
is my opinion just open guys okay so I'm
gonna get into the hair so the hair it
was very good like I said um I have it
here for three months i bleached I
processed the hair I did so much stuff
to it the only problem I had with the
hair was a little bit of shedding and
the shedding wasn't coming from the weft
of the hair and it was shedding at the
ends of the hair like I wouldn't get
long pieces in here and get like little
like num-nums of hair and I kind of
think that's because of over processing
kind of because I bleached it here like
I'm gluten here twice I believe and then
I colored it four times two times blonde
and then two times red two times right
so it's like I have over processing hair
and I think like over processing I
bleached it way too much that probably
is the problem because it looks like the
hair was kind of like split ends it look
like split ends so you know how you get
split ends in here kind of falls off at
the ends so I'm basically under the
impression that's what happened but
that's only because it's my fault it's
not the company's fault or anything like
that it's my fault for my um neglect to
the hair but other than that after after
I bleached her hair dyed the hair the
hair was so good to me it still had like
a nice little natural pattern after I
watched it it curls really good and
straightens and blow dries perfectly
like after I would wash my hair I would
blow dry it out and I like run a flat
iron through it and the hair would have
so much body so it was like like every
single time I would dive in here and do
any process of the air the only problem
I had with the hair was like a little
bit of dead end shedding and that's it
like I said it was not no it wasn't like
the whole hair coming off from the web
it was just a breakage at the end but
that could have been due to my over
processing which you know I take the
blame for that I mean it's not the
company's fault it has nothing to do
with the company it has to do with the
care of the hair and obviously I
neglected the hair when i was bleaching
it but other than that i
washed and conditioned it wasn't dry -
it wasn't dry and it didn't tango so
that's a good thing so out of a 1 a 1
out of 10 I would give the hair about it
9 other than the mistake that I made
with the hair but that's fine I get a
lot of comments about all products that
I use on the hair I use just regular
Garnier Fructis hair products -
fortifying conditioner and shampoo very
simple I use all Garnier Fructis
products on my hair I mean they're very
inexpensive and as long as you do a
really good deep conditioning with the
hair and give it a nice shampoo the hair
will last you a long time just make sure
that you take care of the hair to your
best ability I mean I always stop my
hair everyday I was cold my hair I was
you know fix my hair everyday I don't
really wear ponytails or anything that I
like to style myself up when I leave the
house all my hair was always done and I
was watched it every week and took care
of the hair but for some people that are
look that wanna you know are very low
maintenance and they don't really like
to do all that extra stuff I mean just
find a method that works for you but for
me I would constantly be you know making
sure that my hair was up to par and it
was good you know it smelt good it
looked good it was curled nice and stuff
like that that's just who I am but still
teaches on but if you're a very low
maintenance person finds a method so
that you can you can make sure that you
take care of the hair and that it looks
good and it's not that you're not
putting that much work into it because I
feel like I put a lot of work into my
hair cuz I spend a lot of money so I
don't want my hair to go to waste you
know what I'm saying
I don't want to just buy a product for
like almost I spend like almost $300 out
together on here so it's like I want to
make sure that I'm getting the best
product and I'm taking care of it
because the hair that I still have the
hair now I'm gonna use that hair in the
summertime and then here is still good
like like I said I process it about
about 4 times like maybe four six times
and like it's been it's still good every
time I watch it comes back right the way
it like just went right back in shape
and you can see on all my other videos
what the hair looks like and I went from
blonde
I had a black first to red when I even
took it down one read in the last video
because I did get a question from
someone about the coloring and red arm
brain results video the hair was a bit
brighter and
the bentonite powder video the hair was
a bit darker I just took it down one
color I dyed it down one more color so
as you can tell and in the in the last
video that I had the curls were so nice
and the hair was luminescent was very
rich and shiny and glossy so therefore I
mean like it's really good hearing I
said that's like honestly that's alright
when they can tell you guys like if you
guys I mean I've done videos and I know
a lot of other people have done videos
on this hair so if you don't take my
opinion if I haven't sold you that's a
product yet go watch somebody else's
video and I'm pretty sure that they can
sell you the product better than I can
because honestly I am gonna order from
aliexpress.com I'm gonna order from you
sign your company again like I really
like their hair and like I said it's
just my opinion you guys can choose to
go out and purchase them here if you
want I mean I'm only on here to just
kind of you know tell you guys about my
experience with the hair and so forth

think I've answered all the questions
