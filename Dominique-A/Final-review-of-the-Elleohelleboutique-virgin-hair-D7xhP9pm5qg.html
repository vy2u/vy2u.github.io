today to a quick update and this is a
final review for the LOL boutique virgin
brazilian body wave here and i've had
this hair and for about like i would say
like a month or so i'm not sure get my
pin point but check out my last video
you'll see how long i have is here and
for um if you also find me on instagram
I delicious time 12 you probably see the
postings that I do for the hair on the
hair went from being black and now the
hair is on braids like a blonde color
the color looks a bit like Tingy and
this light kind of like orange II kind
of not really i don't know how to
explain it but it's kind of like a
orangie brassy looking when I first dyed
the hair I had the worst look
the hair turn of orange brassy color and
I had to tone the hair down so I had to
buy shimmer like shampoo to Tony hair
down and I also use color corrector so
when you have here that turns like a
really brassy looking color the best
thing to do is dive in here in ash
blonde color so what I decided to do
that went to Sally's the next day after
I Devon here and i purchased um medium I
on medium as no light ash blonde and I
added that light ash pond to my hair um
I'm not sure the ladies doing justice
but if I walk outside the hair is really
really light and pretty the front the
top of the hair is lighter than the
bottom simply because the frickin hear
that i use in the bottom to add the
extra bundle if you watch my previous
video before i added the janet
collection virgin brazilian body wave
here and it's a piece of as
soon as I dive in here I noticed that
they are shedding a lot and the back is
really sure it's not that long so I lost
a lot of link 2 to the dying from from
the janet collection here but that's not
what the reviews on but just don't buy
that hair guys it really sucks but as
far as the LOL boutique boutique hair
the hair took color very long as you can
tell the dimensions of the color are
extreme it's really nice other than the
fact that coloring the hair was a
disaster but i was able to fix the color
and i was able to make it customize it
to my liking so this is a final results
of the color and i really really like
um I am going to take this unit off and
as you guys know that this is on a u
part wig with the closure but I will be
removing this unit off and I'll be
storing this for the summer because I'm
do another review for a different
company on some different here so this
will just be going on my shelf i will be
posting a video as well on the on the
beauty by Aphrodite curly virgin
malaysian curly hair because so many
guys been asked me out of the hair
holding up and stuff like that but like
i said if you follow my instagram a
delicious dumb 12 you will see all the
pictures and I do my hair a lot ally to
style my hair different like very often
so you will see all the different styles
that I've done with both of these
hairstyles um this hair on a scale of 1
to 10 I get like a seven the only
problem major problem that i have with
any type of here that i have is shedding
and i got a lot of shedding from this
hair even after i sealed the west and I
co wash the hair um I'm nothing well you
know what it sheds a lot i'm not sure if
it's because after i dyed the hair that
i started shedding because before I'd
outta here it was shedding and after I
got here it was shedding other than that
the hair is really pretty that's the
thing that I like die for when it comes
to hear like virgin hair especially or
like hair like this it's like no matter
if it sheds I'm still able to style this
here in different ways I can do whatever
I want with the hair I crimp it i
currently I straighten it I do
everything to the hair in it works for
me and the hair cooperates which is
really good because sometimes you can
get in here that doesn't cooperate and
this does what I wanted to
do excuse my language but still um I I
did everything with this hair i will
post pictures of stream of pitches at
the end or if you want to go follow me
on instagram you can check out the
pictures that i post daily of his hair
I've curled this here i styled it I've
even put layers and I've done everything
to the hair and like I said when I used
to do my reviews I want to do every
dimension I want to show you guys
everything the hair has to offer because
I just don't want to say it's good here
just because I just wort the way it was
I had to change the hair up so coloring
the hair was just to change for me so
eight colors very well and you guys can
tell the color the color is pretty and
like i said i did lose some length from
the coloring or whatever shedding i got
but it's still pretty long
if you watched my previous video before
the hair was like down to my belly
button so i did lose a little bit of
length but the hair is full it's pretty
and it's fun and like i said i do teep
wave the hair this is deep waste all
this is not the natural state of the
hair it's virgin brazilian body wave so
this is not the natural state of the
hair this was accomplished achieved
through deep waving the hair so I deep
wave the hair and i will show you guys
what the deep waver looks like the deep
waver that i use is the Hot Tools deep
waver and it's like this it's really
cool I got this for Sally's it was on so
I was like twenty five dollars which is
really cool my last deep waver that you
guys see into my video year ago was like
um from one word I believe and it was
they broke thing broke in half so you
had to be careful of these because they
split in the middle they can break in
half but this is a new one that I got it
heats up to 430 degrees and it does the
frickin job see my waves are really
pretty and fun it looks more like of a
natural pattern not too crazy and
actually can pull it off as a deep wave
texture instead of like a curl easy way
to touch her you would buy like you
actually buy the bundle here like deep
wave so that's why I usually buy
straight here are or opt to do like body
wave here because it's easier for me to
do styles that I would like because I
could just wander live deep wave it
straighten it and I'll achieve it
instead of getting the hair that's
already processed or steam press that
way so that's about it um so basically
that's it guys if you guys have any more
questions or comments you guys can leave
them down below happy new years I hope
your new year's resolution is as
greatest minds is um I hope everything's
going well for you guys thank you guys
