let's now we better let Sally better
sorry
this review today is brought to you guys
from premier lace wigs calm so this unit
is a 22 inch 360 loose wave textured wig
now you guys saw the specs in the
beginning I did have to go in and tweeze
his hair the hairline myself I did cut
the baby hairs and basically the look I
was going for today was just kind of
like a wet and wavy look usually out
kind of driving curls up but this time I
wanted to do kind of like a really nice
sleek flat type of part middle part and
then just have the hair kind of nice and
wet wavy so the product that I use on my
curls today was a Cantu shea butter for
natural hair moisturizing twist and lock
gel so I used a leave-in conditioner
before but I just recently picked this
one up at Target and this is pretty good
too
so if you have curly hair and you want
to kind of do a nice little twist ease
and curls in it and you want to define
the curls like number one I definitely
recommending recommend using their
products because they do a good job on
all my curly units and I've showed you
guys the other one previously in another
video and it's perfect so I used that I
kind of wet the hair saturate it all
over and then use that and ran it
through my hair so that I can have like
it's nice to find look I want to kind of
like that wet and wavy glossy look just
because I never do Styles like that I
always usually do like a flip over
method or something like that but I do
like this like this with the middle part
kind of press down and you can see in
the Frog do you kind of go in and tweeze
the baby hairs a little bit to kind of
bring in the part a little bit and make
the hairline look more realistic
so I do like this kind of style think it
looks really cute jazzy with the
earrings and the hair line itself and
the parting space looks perfectly
realistic so therefore you can't tell me
nothing so I did use a got to be gluing
I always get asked this question I use
the yellow got to be go there's a black
one too but I've always been on this one
so I don't know if there's a difference
between the ball both of them so you can
leave your comment down below if you
know the difference because I don't I
did use a little bit of argan oil and
this is argon magic it's intense hair
oil and I used to get this from
Marshalls home goods or TJ Maxx it's
really good it's a light argan oil it's
only ten dollars and you get a lot of
product in this bottle so that's what I
kind of used to give myself kind of like
a finished glossy look you guys got you
guys know what I mean like that kind of
like middle part
all the way back thrown back kind of
glossy sexy kind of like Kim K style you
not elect that family but you know what
I mean
so that's what I was going for today and
I hope I achieved it something different
something new on my channel I always do
the same kind of like hair style looks
but then I kind of switch it up with
colors and stuff like that but I wanted
to do this thinking that it would be
kind of like more kind of Pocahontas
kind of natural pretty and flawless so I
hope you guys like this hair now do not
forget guys I will leave the information
down below and I know you guys are
waiting to know about the giveaway so if
you want to know what to give away stay
tuned this week that I'm giving away for
this giveaway is a very simple wig that
I featured two transformation Tuesday's
ago with my friend so this is kind of
like a it was 18-inch wick originally in
and I ended up cutting it into a nice
kind of like blunt fun style so this
unit does not have parting space all
over it just has the middle part style
and it does have a little bit of lace on
the perimeter so you can glue it down
for you to your liking it does have
three combs at the top one comb in the
back and adjustable strap as well so
this wig is going to be perfect with
someone who is low maintenance it
doesn't have all that time for that baby
hair magic or whatever so what I want
