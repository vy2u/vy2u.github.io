stopping by today just to do a quick
makeup tutorial and this makeup tutorial
is just showing you guys how I highlight
underneath my eyes it's a very simple
video it's informative and I will go in
and talk to you guys while I do the
actual application if you guys have any
questions or comments leave them down
below as usual if you haven't subscribe
to my channel yet make sure you
subscribe today leave your comments down
below thumbs up this video for more
videos and just stay tuned for the rest
of this video guys
I'm gonna end up doing is using my
little beauty beautyblender I'm going to
blend this into it for this concealer
you actually don't have to imprint it
too hard because you do kind of get some
movement when you imprint it too much I
just kind of like tap it around it just
to kind of soak it in an instant tell my
under eyes look way better now with them
it with the eyeshadows and everything it
looks way better than I did before so
I'm just going to tap it in there and
then Beauty Blender actually got from TJ
Maxx it was really an extensive it was
about 25 bucks and my sister used to
work there so I she got like a
10-percent discount so I didn't pay that
much money for and this beauty blender i
like because it has like that little
precision tip so it just kind of like
gets into all the spots I actually bring
this down a little bit further so that I
can actually have like a better like
shade i am going to contour my face
after so therefore i can actually get
like some dimension in reckless instead
of looking just like one way i bring it
down to the mustache what's that and a
little bit at the knowledge and up here
to destroy to make sure i love it okay
so now that you see it guys now it's
like really bright so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to mix three powers
together I'm gonna mix the bed night
topaz powder I'm going to mix abend I
see in a powder and I'm also going to
mix these two powders with the
Maybelline shine-free loose powder in
the color medium I would have done the
banana powder but I never bought the
banana powder because I always can just
buy a bat layer powder and mix it as a
trio so that's what I've been doing to
get that like consistent color
underneath my eyes so what I'm going to
do is just mix these three together and
I'm going to actually put these three
together underneath my eyes as well so
i'm just going to use like a little a
little like sponge or whatever and i use
a sponge to put our month under mat
and I do put a lot I know it looks like
I'm going absolutely sick on it but I
put a good amount so that I have I'm
none of it creases at all on my face
like that it's all like it's all there
so that says look I get to lap what I'm
gonna do is button out and get it really
nice so I'm going to use like a flat
brush like this and this is just like an
out it's supposed to be a elf blush
brush but it does well as just kind of
like that um just to me to wipe away the
excess pod so once I let it sit there
melted a while I go in and I kind of
like pattern now so only reason why i
use those three colors together it's
because there's underst has at my skin
has orange undertones in the foundation
that I use that it's like an orange
tinge on it as well and it just looks
nice to actually mix those powders
together and then it's like for one of
the darkest in complexity I feel like
the Topaz at Siena do really well for my
skin I've seen a lot of girls of
darker-skinned rockledge get to just use
the banana powder and it looks great too
but if you're like if you just want to
make sure that you get like um not too
much of it go like a really white
overcast mixing the toe pads at Siena
does really good as well too so that's
why I do that but like I said I've seen
a lot of woman with darker skin
complexions using the banana powder Oh
me and it looks great as well too so
basically that's just about it so
obviously I'm gonna add a little more
touch ups but i just wanted to show you
guys how I get this under I look mercy
is what it look like before without
under eye but you see it's just really
nice and simple and I'll show you
pictures after the completed 13 that's
okay thanks for watching I'll catch you
