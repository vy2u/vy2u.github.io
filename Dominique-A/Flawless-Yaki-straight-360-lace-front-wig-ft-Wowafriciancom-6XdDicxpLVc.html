pleased
obviously the unit looks completely
different from the beginning when I
showed you guys that the unit looked
like when I got it so this unit is from
Walt African comm and it is their 360
yaki straight wig now I got my unit in
18 inches long so it's not super super
long it is about above the breast and it
does obviously shrink when you do curl
it so what I do with my unit is I went
in and I use my do fully curling wand
and I just did a full head of curls now
you can just leave it straight but with
the Straight style I just thought that
the density wasn't big enough if it was
about like 180 density with that unit
with this unit I thought that that would
have been better
it wasn't buff enough for me so I kind
of said to myself okay I never curled
yaki here before so let's try it out so
this is my first time curling yaki here
and I am in love guys I absolutely love
yaki texture hair curls it just looks
way better and it just gives it hair
like more of a big feel and I don't know
with this unit guys I have not received
any shedding or tangling so it's been
obviously doing good for the first part
this is my first time trying it on so I
think like with a couple wears and I'll
really give you guys a definitive idea
if this unit is good or not
but so far so good it did come with a
lot of baby hairs in the front so I kind
of really had to play around with the
baby hairs which was a little bit
annoying I hope I kind of fixed it up
properly honestly and truly it kind of
blends really well right now so I'm
gonna think it's good so I really do
like you guys they try to do like this
little cascade waterfall look at the top
I think that this looks so good and
playful god the train has to come at
this time why is this always happen to
me when I'm filming we're gonna
disregard that noise but like I said
guys I absolutely love this look
guys I think it looks really pretty and
fun the hair texture is what really sold
me I love to hear texture the light yaki
texture it looks great and it does
really mimic african-american hair so I
just I don't know it looks at you know
I'm not gonna stand mimics
african-american hair and mimics press
hair which is one of my favorite things
it kind of makes me feel like I just
went to the hair salon I got me a little
pressed curl so that's all good so
that's basically it guys with this video
