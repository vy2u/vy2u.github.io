chit-chatting get ready with me video so
this is going to be kind of like kind of
like a fall makeup look or whatever you
want to call it I'm actually kind of
winging this right now so I'm not sure
if it's gonna turn out like you know how
I think it's gonna turn out I wanted to
do a nice beat face today so I hope that
today I can get this beat face so I'm
gonna use some product sponsor from octa
Lee and I please a little bit different
I'm not sure if you're allowed to add in
like more than one clip so with the
video review I'm doing today I got kind
of set some companies so from Mac I got
a set and from Becca cosmetics that got
a set too so I'm not sure if that set is
equal to one because it did come
together as one set and I also want to
show you guys the setting powder that I
got as well that I actually really
really like so this will be fun so what
I'm gonna start off doing guys is I'm
gonna start off with priming my face
first and then I'm gonna do my eyebrows
off camera because eyebrows take a long
time to do so the first thing I'm going
to use is the Becca cosmetics back black
oh wait back light priming filter so um
it comes in a bottle like this is the
first time I'm trying this so I'm kind
of nervous usually when I get these
primers my face comes out looking real
chalky so I'm gonna do two pumps cuz I'm
not sure the consistent rule so it's
kind of like a cream color so I'm gonna
start off with this just moisturize Wow
okay so I'm gonna put it in the areas
that I know I catch that shine which is
my forehead and I kind of like a small
breakout right now so hopefully within
the week or so I can get rid of the
breakout it's mostly because I am
messing right now men say I got my
period so I'm just kind of like really
breaking out at the moment so hopefully
I can recover from that soon and of
course when I'm recording someone text
me that's just like a normal thing for
me so this is kind of real shimmery Wow
hopefully it gives me kind of my
foundation a little bit more of a lips
but it's really shiny I look really
shiny wow that's crazy so yeah so if you
do make videos and stuff like that and
you want to get like some free products
definite check out octel e.com and I
will link it down below for you guys
this is where most of my higher-end
products came from cuz you know I'm not
spending my
any other stuff because it's too
expensive so yeah so what I'm gonna do
now is I'm gonna actually pry my eyes
because I have like this weird routine
where I prime my eyes so I'm gonna use
the pro primer HD high-definition eyes
shadow primer and this is from LA girls
wait is it LA girls real cheap of dollar
looks like a dollar ninety-nine so I
just do the under eyes along with the
lids too and if you guys know me and
watch me I'm not really an eyeshadow
person but if I'm gonna do like some
type of like neutral later on I will
have to put something so that doesn't
crease up so I use this just to kind of
mattify that area so I'm not getting
real Creasy so yeah this is a lot of
priming this time I've been trying new
primers guys because I'm really really
oily so I'm trying to test out different
things that will help my skin out so
this is one test that I'm doing right
now and I'm gonna disregard the text
messages because people are really crazy
so now I'm gonna use a Mac prep and
prime and this came from Hockley too and
I'm just gonna spray my face and then
I'm gonna do my eyebrows off camera and
then come back and just start the look
like I was supposed to and then we can
get talking people
sorry guys so I got the brows on right
now and I have been going a little bit
dark on my brows just because you guys
asked and you guys like girl why don't
you do your eyebrows a little bit darker
so like I said I take your things into
consideration so I did go a little bit
darker on the brows and they are a
little bit thicker than usual but this
is all about trying something new so
when I started using for my brows guys I
started using the kiss collection and
kissed professionally in New York they
have a new brow just called top brow and
I've been using this guys I get the
color chocolate chocolate and it's
basically kind of like the honestest
Anastasio dip brow but they're $20 and
this was $6 and it's really nice
consistency guys I use this one and on
top of this when I put the LA Colors pro
their brow kit as well and I kind of
used this brown one and this dark one to
kind of make it a little bit more darker
than usual since you guys want a darker
so I'll use this too and this was like a
dollar at the dollar store
and I just top it off with toffee from
LA girls which is my favorite and I just
clean it off with this just to get it
kind of clean but after I put the
foundation on everything I'll go back in
with this one and try to fix it
so yeah just drop that whatever so what
I'm gonna do now guys I'm gonna use my
Anastacio cream contour kit now I
usually wouldn't buy something like this
just because it's really expensive but I
went to TJ Maxx and they had these for
20 dollars so your girl got it
originally I think it's like 40 for $40
and I wouldn't have to pay that for that
but yeah so since this is a Titch I get
ripped with me video let's talk so if
you guys some of you guys know Lana I
reached a hundred thousand subscriber
mark and that was kind of like in
September so um I haven't done like a
huge announcement thing or whatever just
because I'm really busy guys like I work
like regular full-time hours as a nurse
as someone you guys may already know and
I know you guys want like videos talking
and stuff like that about being a nurse
this and that school like things like
that and I will talk to you guys about
that I actually am back in school now so
it'll be even better to add these things
into my channel whatever so if you guys
want to see videos about that definitely
that in the comment section down below
and of course outside there's a lot of
chaos going on so here Carlin's going
off outside now and my ears on right now
so if you guys can hear that while I'm
talking
it's hot listen so yeah so yeah so I I
was really excited when I saw the
hundred can I'm like wait a minute did I
really just hit this hundred K like when
I came back from Jamaica I like eighty
thousand subscribers which was in August
and then like I just got the hundred K
in September I'm like damn yo these
people really rocking out for your girls
so I was I'm really really thankful guys
you guys don't even understand I think
like it was kind of like a week after I
had like this emotional breakdown and I
know that sounds cheesy to some people
but like honestly I was really really
happy like that whole week that weekend
that that I got 200k is my I had a
surprise birthday dinner for my
boyfriend cause he turned 27 and I
decided to let some surprise birthday
for a thing for him so then the day
after I realize I hit the hundred
thousand subscribe and working on my
damn I was so stressed out the week
head planning this little thing for him
and stuff like that so I did a really
good time to enjoy you know as much as I
wanted to enjoy when it came to my
YouTube channel and I'm trying to be
more consistent with YouTube because I
like it a lot
and like I say to you guys sometimes I
know I don't want to offend people I say
oh this is just my hobby this is not my
career and stuff like that and I never
mean to say I don't want to say so that
people get offended because this is
people's career it's like people do this
as a career but for me this became this
is a hobby and like I said this how
YouTube is really good guys if you want
to make this your career you definitely
can a lot of other youtubers have done
that so therefore I can just see the
potential in that kind of field but as
far as I going to school I mean I went
to school you know stuff like that so I
like my profession you know I'm saying I
have to collect my coins they're collect
my coins here and just be real coinage
or whatever you want to call it so it's
it's kind of like it's great and then
the thing I love about YouTube is a
community I like the people I know
sometimes it seems like you know you get
a lot of like hate comments a lot of
like things like that notice the more
subscribers I get coming at me but it's
okay
and I know you guys are looking like
bitch you're looking really orange right
now but when I color correct right now
it really helps me out like really good
have a lot of dark spots what's the
foundation comes to that just doesn't
look right
so I know you guys are that bitch you're
orange orange but we will fix this
do not worry so what I'm going to use
for my foundation and even if I don't
blend this out all the way when I have
the foundation it'll blend out so I'm
gonna use the maybelline superstay
better skin foundation in combination
with the Maybelline Matlin sport+
foundation in mocha this is darker and
this is a little bit lighter so I mix
these together to get my combination
color people I mean I don't know someone
left a comment saying on my makeup was
too light and listen I know light makeup
and I've seen videos with light makeup
my makeup is not light but I've been
trying to do different mixes because
like in the summer time I got really
dark and then like as the summer kind of
went away my tan faded cuz I went on
vacation like crazy this year
so everything I was like having to
readjust myself a lot this summer so
this is the mix I'm gonna make I mix a
big chunk of the
Kerwin and they added two parts of the
light ones so hopefully this will kind
of balance that you guys could see it's
like a patchy color so hopefully this
will balance out I use a beauty blender
for this because it just works out
better for me so I'm going to fast
forward this because you guys don't need
to see all this pounding on my face so
I'm a fast forward this part
you
alright guys so I'm done putting this
foundation all over so it still looks
orange so what I'm gonna do is add my
Maybelline fit me 360 pressed powder or
face powder and this basically helps
modify the areas that I need to mattify
it really helps me I kind of actually
like to take my nail and push them to do
my nail into it just because sometimes
they don't be giving me enough of the
powder so I'm gonna just use this
regular Ola colors brush I'm not really
a brush person to let you guys know the
truth I don't like I'm not really a
makeup person like that either just do
it and then that's it so ask me
questions about feeling that Oh No
and I know you guys notice that I leave
my eyes alone I wait to do my eyes after
I do the foundation just because I wanna
this I'm just particular I don't know if
there's a real way to do makeup this is
just the way I do it so I'm just gonna
put the powder on
and this toy that I have on guys it is a
wig that I made it's a 360 unit guys so
um it's really simple I'll leave the
I'll put the description for or I'll
leave it somewhere up here say us and
check out that video it's a 360 28 inch
straight hair that I made and I just
kind of deep waved it up and glued it
down this will be my weekend way because
I'm just not about to just keep
transform transforming ways transforming
my look this week so I'll try to keep it
simple in my lips chat boy so this is
what the foundation looks like so far
hope it actually looks good so obviously
it's still a little bit flat so what I'm
gonna do now is I'm going to conceal my
eyes and I use the LA Pro concealer and
coffee it's just my color so I'm just
gonna conceal the eyelids
I'm just so I can give it all one color
one look one tone and yeah just kind of
moving it but the thing and I'm actually
using my Beauty Blender that's time to
be able in this end cuz I don't feel
like using my finger right now or maybe
I should cuz sometimes I use my finger
and my finger will really know
excellence fine so I'm gonna kind of
melt this in with the concealer what the
Beauty Blender and studies my finger
today cuz using a finger thing gets
really annoying
okay that worked better than I thought
honestly and truly so let me just go in
with a little bit more cuz I like it to
be really really like really really one
tone one way and you know what even
before I do that I'm gonna just add some
powder so I'm gonna use I bought the
Laura Mercier powder and it's really
good I saw a lot of reviews on it but
acting better so I'm just gonna use some
of the loin Mercier powder right here
because this part of my face gets really
oily quick so I'm gonna put this here
and let it sit for a while and under my
chin so while I finish the rest of the
face I'll just be simulated
oh yeah so I'm gonna just leave it like
that for now I want to show you guys
another part of that I got that set and
part of that is pretty legit so I use
this Beauty Blender always I use it for
the I do everything with this one Beauty
butter knives I need to clean it to ask
listen what a Dinge so like I said I'm
just going to Pat this in and basically
now you can see that my face art has one
color one dimension so I'm gonna go in
and do a little bit of a shadow now you
guys know I like to do not a shadow like
a base so what I'm using is the room all
where meliza trim oh I don't even know
it is it's Rimmel and it's a bronzing
powder and this is Sundance number 27
and it just comes in like a little color
wheel like this so I use these as base
colors on my eyelid just so that I have
like a neutral look so I'm just gonna go
over the concealer with this like I
usually do it used to I used to use the
other one I forgot the name of it but I
don't condone below for you guys who are
in here somewhere so I use this as a
base coat because if I want to do like
just like really nice lashes a liner
which is kind of like my signature look
and you guys are always saying oh your
makeup so nice that's pretty basic guys
it's pretty basic pretty basic pretty
amazing you're not supposed to be
uploading a video right now and I'm
doing this like I'm just like
multitasking AF you're honestly I
started school and school is kicking my
ass like I don't like I don't like I'm
not into that I'm not in the mood yeah
or like I'm not into the swing of things
and usually like if I get into the swing
of things I'm really good at it but this
time I'm just not I'm not in the swing
of things right now so I really to you
know step my cookies up and really get
there like a lot of things are happening
and you know what a lot of good things
are happening like in my life right now
so I'm really like it's like I'm having
a really good year I'm having a good
year you know things just could get
better and I'm just really thankful for
everything that happened to that has
happened to me this year since a year is
not over yet so I don't want you guys to
think that anything that happened with
YouTube hasn't been like a blessing to
me it's been a bull
like this year has really changed like
everything every perspective that I
initially had like I just like like
relationship wise family wise work wise
school wise everything has really
improved like I just I was not in a good
place a few years like two years ago
2015 and 2016 I actually stepped out of
a relationship that I was in for seven
years six or seven years and the person
I was dating just did not know what he
wanted and I was like kind of like stuck
and you know I fell in love with the
family the family became like my best
friends and you know even when I wasn't
with him I was always with the family
and they were just like so important to
me and just leaving that leaving I was
more heartbroken leaving their family
versus leaving him because I didn't care
anymore the relationship was over the
love was over and it's over but when I
had to leave the family I was really
really sad so um it took me a while to
kind of dissociate or kind of like
remove myself in that situation so I met
someone else fell in love like it's just
a lot of things happen and a lot of
unexpected things happen like this was
unexpected me reaching 100 K my new love
life was unexpected once I was able to
let things go and let God work his
powers to help me out I noticed a lot of
things were happening for me and I'm so
thankful I'm just really thankful and I
know that there's gonna be a lot of
greater things that are gonna happen so
I'm just counting my blessings every
single day honestly and truly like I
don't even understand like like things
could have been so much different Oh God
I was reckless things could have been so
much different the things that I was so
reckless I didn't care about myself I
didn't love myself and I was just like
right now this is the happiest I am I'm
like you know like I'm I'm happy and you
know people say oh I'm really happy no
like I'm a happy Oh like I'm really
happy so I'm basically just putting this
fighter on because the longer takes me
to do this makeup the more only I'm
gonna get so these are the these are the
target zones for me my Hocker I'm not
gonna put anything on the Hawker I might
just pay a little bit the Hawker the
sides right here definitely catch oil on
the crease the Hat down here and then
right here where my eyebrows are so
little let that sit I'm gonna show you
guys my lashes that I'm gonna put on and
some mascara and then we'll do what I
just put the lashes on I'm not gonna do
anything in my height size like this
base color right here just works fine
for me it looks really neutral and I
don't really have to go above and beyond
so I'm gonna keep it like this and then
just put these popping lashes on so I'm
gonna get the lashes to show you the
lashes that I'm gonna use are from salon
perfect and they're the 6:15 and this is
what they look like let me see if I can
bring it up and they don't wanna wash me
the on out let me stop cussing cuz
you guys hate Pat it's Colin Wow you
guys don't me to be myself but these are
what they look like guys they're really
cute they're kind of like some wispy
style lashes that they look pretty cute
in that too bold so what I'm gonna do
one more thing guys so I'm gonna use the
NYX stay matte but not flat powder face
powder and I got this one is in deep
dark so what I'm gonna do with this one
is add this one on my lid and I'm gonna
use this mostly like a crease color just
to give my eyes a little bit more of a
definition so I'm just gonna give myself
a little bit of a crease on it
and I'm using an eco style in the Eco
style eco brush or whatever you want to
call it you need this from Walmart
getting follow
see that's why don't you conceal
separate so just to give me more like of
a kind of like a deeper like tone on my
lids cuz my lids kind of look natural
lids so does it give me like a deeper
tone I'm just gonna go in with this
brown color or this foundation powder
and it just kind of give me more of
definition so these this NYX flat this
is a really good guys and obviously it's
a little bit darker than my skin just a
little bit smidge but it definitely will
go good for eyelids I think this is a
good transition color so let me show you
guys what it looks like so you guys can
see exactly on top of my so it looks
like that it's kind of like an orange II
base color which is really nice so
that's what I use so I'm going to put my
lashes on now lashes lashes look you
know what I made with my lashes I'm
gonna put some mascara on first and then
up on my lashes and I'll come back and
show you guys with eyelashes look like
eyelashes take forever to put on but in
the meanwhile we're gonna do a little
contour now if you guys don't know about
LA girls cuz most of the stuff in this
video
la girls that's not sponsored well I did
you show you guys I'm in my unboxing a
long time so I'm gonna use their la
girls prophase High Definition mouth
press matte pressed powder now this
one's too dark so I'm going to use this
as a contouring it works perfect as a
contour with this angle brush so I'm
gonna use this as a contour and we're
gonna go so if you guys make sure you
guys follow me on my social media I know
someone was like oh do you ever snap
snap for me is fun but snap can get
really distracting so I try not to do
too much of that snappy stuff if you
watched my Instagram Amazon Instagram
story because I'm always on my Instagram
period so instagram my instagram story I
do like to post a lot on Instagram story
wow this see what I'm saying guys this
is and this is in the column see this is
in the colored GPP six one five Coco
like come on guys like this is look at
look at that so definitely carries you
into that you can get yourself a nice
contour with this one and I do go around
the trail of my baby ears around here
kind of darken up in the areas here and
stuff like that every time I pass my
hand over the camera it turns dark so
let me just be careful when I do that so
you see that guys and then this is how
sometimes you also asked me Oh your face
looks so nice I looked I kind of like
look back on videos like if you add in
the contour and stuff like that and when
your face is initially kind of like that
freaking orange color once you start
adding a definition to you really kind
of lose that flat look which I don't
like I would never walk out the house
looking flat like I would have to put
something with my face to kind of pull
me out a little bit so that's what I'm
trying to do it this way and I hope you
guys can't hear this TV show that I
forgot to put the volume down Melissa
I'm watching Family Matters
Family Matters is actually back on next
is on Hulu now guys all seasons and it's
like 180 something episodes as a matter
fact it's like 200 episodes like they
really I don't even know and I watched
that growing up and if you were born in
the 1990s you probably watched it to our
watch that growing up and I didn't even
realize they had that many episodes so
the next part I want to show you guys
guys before is the Potter from it's
called graftobian and it's their makeup
collection I think I saw um Destiny's
goalie with this yo this powder right
here guys is amazing as I've fallen all
over the place doughy so this powder is
their banana cream pie
this setting powder right here is
actually I would say this that the and
I'm not a makeup artist this powder is
actually better than the Laura Mercier
powder I don't like something about it
it just I don't know but you know what I
do guys I actually mix a lot more CA
powder with a banana cream powder but I
overload the banana cream powder because
I like about it yeah so I'm gonna go
back in with the Beauty Blender and I'm
going to just make sure I emphasize on
the bottom of a contour sometimes when I
do this it like the Laura Mercier one
sometimes when I do with the Laura
Mercier powder yes the line will stay
there even after I buffed it out and I'm
like oh my god like come off but this
banana powder it will not it won't it
won't come off so I really like it with
this one like look at that girl and I
feel like I did my Cointreau kind of low
but I don't really like it too high so I
think this is V this will be dead so I'm
going to just put this on both sides I
kind of like play with it a little bit
um yeah so I'm kind of recording this
late into the - didn't record this
earlier but I want my sister to the
dealership she was looking into my to
trading in her car and getting something
different but she kind of thought about
it she's almost dumping her car off so
it's kind of like why even invest and
she's like so like she like her dream
cards to get Alexis I have a like 7
Lexus NX a Lexus NX F Sport know I've
had Lexus for years the first Lexus that
I got was is 250 and they don't even
make the ice they stop making the eyes
250 last year so there's a lot yeah they
stopped making the eyes 250 I think the
last year so the only one that they have
now is the 350 instead of the 250 and I
got an SUV now I got the I got the EDX
which is more so of a girly SUV the RX
one is way too big when I test drove
that when I was
kind of like so I got that car like a
year ago
and I really liked it guys it's a really
nice car very sporty there was nothing
wrong - 250 it was a really nice car was
white one was ice white nice leather
great leather seats but the problem with
that one was that it was - it was
smaller I couldn't really put a lot of
stuff and I'm kind of planning ahead in
the future so I wanted to get a car that
I knew that I could have when I have
children stuff like that cetera et
cetera and just have more space and I
don't know I wanted to get a new car so
when I got in the car so I really like
it guys it's so nice and used on my
Instagram I post on Instagram when I got
it it's beautiful it's all black with
the cherry seats inside it comes in
navigation all that kind of stuff it's a
crazy it's a sports car and it's an SUV
so it's like amazing so she wants to get
a car like that so she's like I'm not
gonna buy a new car because if I get in
no car it's gonna be a waste because
it's not the dream car that I want the
dream car I want is Alexis so she's
trying to she's trying to work her way
up to again then I really hope it's
gonna happen for it's gonna happen so
I'm gonna put my lashes on her shoes are
on and I am still baking to this moment
right now so the only ways while I'm
leaving this powder on is because I'm
telling you guys I will get oily in a
heartbeat so I'm trying to avoid fitting
back from happening so I put the lashes
on though like mm-hmm
so they're really delicate lashes I
didn't have the mascara nyet on it yet
because I am going to go in and put a
little bit of concealer I mean I can see
the liquid eyeliner not very frugal I'm
telling you guys I use elf I don't care
I'm not gonna use anything else because
everything else is too expensive and as
far as the mascara goes I got this for
like a dollar I was on like clearance at
my girls free store so I got the
Maybelline colossal spider effect so I
use this on my top lashes just to blend
them and then I use this on my bottom
just to kind of give me like more of a
it's like a girly effect or whatever so
and my earring got foundational girly
more of a girly effect look or whatever
so yeah so that's what I'm gonna do and
I want to mention this right now because
you guys asked me often so I know you
guys are like really tempted or really
kind of like girl what are you gonna do
Excel what are you gonna do it so when
you gonna do it so so I'm actually
working on a website right now and my
friend is actually helping with this
website so I'm just kind of we're
working
the price has already started the
website itself on Big Cartel so it's not
up and running yet I'm still working on
the perks and stuff another work the
tweaking it and stuff like that because
you guys know that I'm going to do
waiting sell wigs and you know stuff
like that so it's like there's a lot of
things going on so I just don't want to
kind of rush into anything without
having it like clearly set cuz I'm not
I'm not to this I don't know how to sell
ways online how I collect payment I know
how to collect payment but like like
shipping wise like you know each sending
stuff to the UK and setting stuff to us
would be different so you have to put
all those things into consideration and
like I said I don't want to just jump
into something and be kind of blindsided
when I started so I'm trying to do it
the right way so I'm doing the concealer
side to the arm toffee I'm just gonna go
in with the contour kit again I'm gonna
use this light color just to add it to
this so that I can get more of a
highlighting look you don't have to put
too much I just put a little bit just to
really give me that Oh
so I'm gonna leave the powder it doesn't
matter if the powder gets mixed into the
concealer and I guess I'm using that
Beauty Blender again I don't know if
there's a rule that you're supposed to
change the Beauty Blender while you're
doing a whole entire face but like I
said I'm doing works for me so if
someone's a makeup artist and once let
me know let me know but that's what I do
so I'm just gonna beauty blend this and
I used to use brushes for my foundation
way back when but the brushes for some
reason they just don't do as a good job
assist and I believe this is from Real
Techniques I think this is from Real
Techniques and these just so the camera
decided to cut me off in the middle of
me putting this concealer on so I just
went ahead and did it off the camera so
I'd use the cream the graph will be
graph graph the being you know what
embarrassing moments like this so I'm
just gonna insert it and just not waste
my time embarrassing myself on here
trying to work it out I thought I said I
think I said it right the first time I
just cannot get it now so I'm coming on
here like a real yellow rule so
basically use the luxury powder to the
cast
it says looks Kashmir HT setting powder
whatever so that's what I use under my
eyes after I did it so what I'm gonna
use
was just a regular old powder brush and
I'm going to actually go over the other
stuff that I've done so that I could
kind of make this face come a little bit
better so I'm just gonna use my 360 fit
me foundation I'm pressed powder over my
face to kind of buff everything out
I'm gonna go back in with that contour
color
going to kind of contour a little bit
more because I don't want my face to
look flat I really want to get it to
give me more of a look you know what I'm
saying a look so it's a buck to actually
fix that the contour after to really
give it more of not such a blunt look
like that what I'm going to do guys I'm
going to add a little bronzing powder on
top of it to kind of really finish me
off and like I said this is the way I do
my makeup I don't it's not like
professions for a professional so I do
it the way I like to do it so I'm gonna
go in with let's the absolute New York
it's a bronzing powder that they have
and it looks like this and I've killed
it so I'm gonna use this one to do what
put on my cheeks just to kind of really
give me more of a upbringing so look at
that now you see how my face isn't
saying these turn change no Mike I'm
already like less orange and I was
before so I want I add this on just to
really bring me to life a little bit
it's a bronzing powder so you can just
kind of so that's that for that and it's
already bringing a different dimension
to my skin which I like guys so what I'm
gonna do now is add some liquid eyeliner
and I told you guys I use alpha cos
alpha is really it's cheap inexpensive
and it does a job let me just fix his
mascara issue I'm having my eyelash
caught some of that powder so it's kind
of giving me like some light areas okay
so I'm going to add this liquid eyeliner
now I don't as far as my lashes I mean
I've swallowed my lips like they wanna
do like a nice deep berry lip like I'm
gonna like my outfit today is gonna be
really simple so I just wanted to do
like a little bit of a drama make up a
little bit now look at that winged
eyeliner it's a little bit chunkier than
I like but I couldn't I can deal with it
so this as far as ever they go and my
eyes already turning red why is this
happening
not while I'm recording dude so I just
do one long stroke of my hand I just do
it one time I'm really good
there so I kind of like this routine I
just want you done I'm gonna be sitting
there trying to fix I might go over this
one in just a little bit uh-oh here goes
the mistakes this body so I'm just gonna
clean that up right there
just one little swipe of my brush Oh God
dum dum dum
I messed up okay let's see if we can fix
it
got it ooh magic you see that baby
though okay ready set go
some done that's it that's like
legitimately all I do so now I'm gonna
go in with the spider effects mascara
and you guys see how the face is already
coming like this is my signature look
other than I did kind of give my legs a
little bit more of a darker kind of like
smoke to them that's what it is kind of
a dark smoke so I'm just gonna go in and
when I do in my lashes I'm at the fake
false lashes
I actually just spotted it myself by
going from the root of it and kind of
like shaking up and when you do it like
that it makes the lashes more bigger or
bigger you don't have the more part cuz
it's already here I'm doing so it makes
it bigger like this so I'm on this chap
alright guys so I'm going to use the
colour-pop cosmetics liquid lipsticks
now I haven't used these in a while and
last video I did I have like this dark
lip on that you guys were like oh my god
I love it so I'm gonna do this again and
I'm going to do it like kind of bold ish
like I like it when it's really bold so
I'm gonna keep this bold look on my lips
so let's go so I'm gonna use LAX and I'm
gonna use Avenue so we're gonna use a
pencil first I use a brown lip pencil
and this is from wet and wild it is a
color dark brown I get this from any
place you can practically buy anywhere
and it's
the same thing Jack Brown that's all you
needed huh so I'm aligned and you guys
let me hear everything in the background
while I'm doing this because another
thing in the background that ear is odd
right now so like I'm really can't with
these lights in here I cannot I cannot I
cannot alright
like it just doesn't work so I'm gonna
do sound like experts to go over on the
line like this lip combination is really
nice and I think I'll make it might be a
little too strong for but whatever we'll
see
Oh God look at that I'm gonna try to get
into the crease to the corner it really
round out might keep his well computer
son I think it's okay to keep his vow
why am I talking when I'm doing this
okay
I'm super weird with this R a.m. so I'm
gonna go with Avenue and Avenue is not
really dark but I'm just doing it just
to give him more of like a hue sits now
the reason why I like these lipsticks a
lot they mattify instantaneously so um
I'm gonna let that Matt oh my god that
looks so great once I like this Potter
off but I'm not done yet so this is you
I'm gonna call this video my fall get
ready with me video you know so now I'm
going to go back in cuz I really like
the red in the middle not too much I'm
just gonna shade it in it lightly with
the LAX
oh my listen you buff so
you see that now it's really coming out
really rich so I'm gonna go with my
pencil again and really make it buffer
on the edges that's what gives it like
that really vamp look I might need a
sharp in this cuz it's kind of dull
uh-huh yeah i'ma have to sharpen is this
looking kind of dull but you could
already see what I'm talking about guys
so I'm just gonna go it's kind of like a
layered thing so I'm gonna fast forward
this part because it's gonna turn into
like a repetitive thing so I'm a fast
for this part
coming to the season finale right now I
got a hoop earrings on set the clips out
of my hair and everything oh my god
like I'm really feeling that once I once
I kind of buff this lip in I am feeling
it sis all right so I'm gonna just buff
this out okay
now you guys can see that look at that
face no alright alright alright so I'm
gonna use my tart tart let tight Letta
tartlet whatever palate and it is called
in the bloom in from turn so I'm going
to do a little tear stock magic with
this one and this is what the palette
looks like guys so I'm gonna do a little
tear duct magic whether I use these two
colors right god
so I'm gonna use these two colors right
here to give myself a little bit of a
tear duct go lamb amazing a little elf
brush just of crease brush but it fits
perfect in the tear duct area so I use
it for my tear duct and I love doing a
nice little tear duct I think it makes
your face looks so much so angelic
and I usually kind of buff it in the
white part because I really wanted to be
C to work really nicely thank God
editing this video is not as strenuous
as editing any other video because this
video is going to just be straight up
you know so it's not like you know what
I mean
so I also take the tear duct and push it
a little bit towards the center part
where the lash begins just because I
wanted to look like a transition instead
of just come out of nowhere
so I change I pull it from the middle
just to give me more of a you know time
so bad so now I'm gonna go in with Becca
cosmetics highlighter and the shimmering
skin prefer what is the name it's it's
opal I think it is uh neither freaking
off but it looks like this and it's
pretty light so when you're getting this
stuff from octal you guys it really
doesn't specify skin tone so I'm just
gonna go light with it it's really nice
so it really gives you that highlight
look that you will want but this one's a
little bit late so I'm just gonna show
you guys what it looks like
so that's what that woman saying I'm
gonna do a little bit of my nose
and keep it slow you see that
I almost mess my lipstick up so that I'm
just gonna go on this side as usual - in
my hair it's looking so cute today and
it's gonna hide it right here
oh okay not wait wait a minute wait a
minute oh my god do you guys see that
girls stop stop it why ain't I coming to
over here like that okay mm-hmm oh my oh
my wait a minute you know what guys go
get you a Becca's please this is so
pretty like oh my god so I'm gonna go in
with Becca cosmetics they have like a
little blush that I got now I'm not
really a blessed person but I thought
this blush was cute so this one is in
the color Snapdragon that's a really
nice color suitable reasonable College
like a pink color I'm not really a blush
person but I'm gonna add this with this
one just to kind of give me more of a
look just kind of you know give me an
extra little pink now I might see a bra
good guys like what and I was like I'm
being overly dramatic right now but this
looks so pretty I'm I'm actually shocked
I didn't think I was gonna arrive like
this mmm-hmm okay so guys the last thing
I'm gonna really do to this is just do
my bottom line something you're gonna
use the L'Oreal Paris voluminous
smoldering eyeliner this is by far one
of my favorite eyeliners if you're
really trying to get a nice under eye
black on our black but if you try to
really give yourself that under eye look
I definitely highly recommend getting
this now even if you're using this just
to put the line in and smoldering it out
it really I can't even begin to tell you
guys how I love this product so I'm
gonna do this under my eyes I'm gonna
get it real nice and I'm not too
smoldering I'm just kind of dragging
underneath just to give me like a little
bit of a darker look and this is a
reason why I try not to do like such a
heavy eye in the top area because it's
kind of unnecessary when you're gonna do
like stuff like this now you can already
see my face has just turn like different
like I just it just I got like a sec I
just got really sexy all of a sudden you
know what I'm saying like I just
transformed so let's go
so yeah so now I'm gonna go in with just
some mascara and this is cheap this is
mega proteins mascara and it's like $1
at Walmart so I'm just gonna go in under
my eyes and just add a little bit of
mascara to kind of really bring in the
color a little bit
oh yeah I don't know why this airs still
on the air it's still bumping and like
you making all this freaking noise so if
you guys hear it in the background I do
apologize once again I'm like a broken
record you're apologizing over and over
again for the disrespectfulness of the
air the air conditioning so guys I guess
that is it with this look what you guys
think the color is kind of really making
me brighter than when I am so hope you
guys take that into consideration
because it's looking like my face is
like 17 shades dark lighter when it
really is not so I hope you guys take
into consideration everything else
matches so there's my real color guys
don't get confused don't get confused so
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
