for you guys so I kind of asked on
instagram what kind of videos you guys
would like to see and I got a lot of
makeup tutorials love books try out
house and stuff like that but I haven't
really done makeup tutorials in a while
so I'm gonna try to add these into the
lineup as well seeing that you guys love

basic but I mean basic is always
beautiful so I guess that's gonna work
so I will promise guys I'm gonna leave
all the informations down below for you

products that are used for this video
now I don't know what I'm gonna call
this looking at I'm just gonna kind of
go and just do anything usually
sometimes when my skin is looking this
good I like to kind of like gonna go
crazy with the makeup I'm not really
like a shot a person like you guys know
so I kind of like do a lot of neutral
looks natural looks and stuff like that
I'm gonna do lipgloss because I've been
really into lipgloss lately so I'm gonna
do a nice lip gloss combination for you
guys that you guys would probably really
like so you guys can see that in full
action but this is what my skin looks
like regular guys no makeup whatsoever
no brows and nothing and as far as my
contacts go guys my contacts are from a
company called Color CL and I believe I
believe that these ones are kind of like
the ash Brown I'm not sure exactly what
color they are but they have like a
little bit of a pixelation it's it's
cute oh my god my eyebrows oh they have
like a little bit of a pixelation which
is really cute and they're just brown so
they just kind of amplify my own brown
eyes so I really like these a lot and

like to see her brown ones which are
like the hazel ones that I wear like all
the time those are my favorite and those
