hey guys how's it going welcome back to
another big Wednesday so this here that
I have in today guys it's from premier
lace wigs CO and this is a 360 LWO -
style wig now this is indian remy hair
that i have an 18 inches long natural
color and it's yaki straight my cap size
is a medium cap size and this is 150%
density now this is what i like to call
one of those really really nice simple
units simple meaning it's just a
straight unit that you can really make
look nice and natural around the
perimeter and it just looks like it
could be your real hair now it is a yaki
texture so it's kind of like a light bit
of a kind of like a kink to it which I
like when I did straighten I just
straightened it a little bit just pass
it straight into through it just to kind
of give it a little bit of a bone
straight look the thing I like about
yaki here is that when you have yaki
here you don't really have to go crazy
straightening it just a little bit a
little straightening would just go a
long way I just want the flat iron
through it like twice and this is how it
looks now
mine's was 18 inches but I did cut the
ends off just because when I have here
that's 18 inches I like it to be kind of
like a blunt look or like a even cut so
I just cut the ends of this one just to
kind of solidify and make it look
perfect so let me show you guys how long
this baby is this hair is definitely a
very cute hairstyle it looks realistic
are I show my sister my sister was like
wow that looks really like real it's
like you're real here so um I do like
this a lot definitely check out from ear
lace wigs calm if you're interested in
purchasing any of their units I'm not
sure what this is listed as but I will
link it down below for you guys do you
guys are interested no it's been a long
time since I've had a unit like this I
look really real like when I mean real
guys like it feels so nice so soft and
one other thing when I say I got a
medium capsize in my head is small the
ear tabs landed exactly perfect the way
they should so you can see my hair this
landed perfect and in this side landed
perfect as well so this one fits your
circumference perfect I didn't have to
do measurements I just kind of
guesstimated and came to a conclusion
that the medium cap size would fit me
and this one fits perfect like
everything about this guy's is so nice
like look at the sides I
added a little bit of powder in the
beginning when I showed you guys and the
powder was a little bit light so I just
went it with a darker powder on top of
it just to kind of make it look a little
bit better and I begin our look thousand
all these powders to light but listen
you guys are fixing mistakes I fixed
that mistake so it does look really good
with the kind of crustiness of the got
to be glue I'm just saying go in with a
little bit of oil and try to kind of
clean it up with a little bit of argan
oil which is what I usually do anyways
but other than that I just I love this I
think it looks really good what I would
do guys is just customize baby hairs a
little bit they come a little bit long
so I just use my scissors just to kind
of clip them a little bit and most of
the ones on this that I kind of left
them the way they were but yeah so this
is what it looks like I'm very pleased
guys I'll link all the information down
below for you guys if you guys are
interested in purchasing this unit and
other units from premiered last week's
