what
oh great
guys so that basically wraps up the
video I hope you guys enjoy my little
lookbook video today
so I'm trying to do different stuff some
of you guys hate when I do like long
videos and talk too much so I wanted to
kind of do like a short version video
today and show you guys the items that I
tried on like on for a longer period of
time so you guys can kind of get like a
gist of what they look like now I do
like a lot of the stuff that I got stuff
from pretty little things they are a
great website all my clothing items were
size 12 and 14 so those are the sizes
that I chose and they fit perfectly they
do have a plus size section and their
regular section goes all the way up to
size 12 plus size starts from 14 and up
so you have like a great option of items
and their plus size section clothes are
just as trendy as a regular size section
clothes so you won't have any issues
finding something really nice for
Valentine's Day so because it is
February I have to try to do some videos
like this for you guys if you guys are
looking for looks for Valentine's Day
I'm really not a cliche like that
anymore I think as once I've gotten
older and just kind of like whatever if
I go off to dinner and maybe like a
little movie or something that's cool
but most of the time I'm the type of
person that just wants to stay home and
chill just because it just gets really
cliche really annoying after a while so
you just kind of want to spend time with
your loved one alone so guys I hope this
video was great I hope you guys liked it
make sure you leave your comments down
below but first do not forget guys to
thumbs up this video leave your comments
down below subscribe and share this
video with your friends and family
people and I will catch you guys in a
later one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
