asked a thousand questions on my
Instagram channel i'm instagram page and
youtube channel from you guys you guys
just wanted an update on how the hair is
going and as you guys can tell the hair
looks great
i'm still wearing the hair from there to
there because I am still reviewing hair
company I'm reviewing it for other hair
companies and you guys know that I just
started an affordable hair serious so
therefore I'm trying to bring in the
videos for you guys so um thus far this
here is great as you guys can tell the
hair looks different I did cut the hair
in the hair is a bit darker in color and
I've only done that I did that just
because I was receiving a little bit of
problem from the hair I was getting a
lot of shedding from the hair I noticed
that the Shetty was coming from the 24
inch bundle which was the longest bundle
length that I actually had in my head so
what I ended up doing was pulling that
bundle out and just leaving the 22 18
and 20 inch bundle and just the closure
at the top and then I decided to cut the
hair so the hair is kind of blot now
it's not um that it was really long
before and like I said it was starting
to thin out because I was losing length
so I just decided I'm gonna just go for
this kind of like blunt look and I know
this kind of look is in season right now
so I just wanted to try it off with this
hair and I absolutely love it and it's
an effortless look and it just baby
basically takes like 10 or 20 minutes in
the morning just to get ready I just add
some curls in it and then I just keep it
pushing so I really like this look
basically what I had to do was dive in
hair darker and I used emetic panic
virgin snow and white toner because the
hair was already processed and it was
already a lighter color me adding this
hair color on top of my on top of the
gray already just kind of made the hair
turn chrome and it kind of lifted it a
little bit and then darkened it at the
same time which I like and you didn't
get this color from Sally's I got it for
about like 5 bucks and Manic Panic works
really good you actually don't have to
even mix it with developer you could
just put it on my hair and keep it
pushing I did go in and darken the roots
of my hair as well so I did color
the roots are dark but a black a natural
black color just so that I can give the
hair so basically that everything comes
out more striking like my face looks a
little bit more striking with the dark
roots and then the gray ends it just
kind of brings the structure of my face
and my tones out more prominently with
this hair color so yeah other than that
the hair it's good I consider there
being really good hair I did like I said
longer lengths you do receive shedding
so that's something that the company
needs to work out by themselves because
I'm just doing the review for myself I
did I'm not sponsored by this company I
purchased this here by myself
and I just wanted to do something for
you guys so yeah if I was gonna buy from
this hair company again I would probably
stick to the shorter lengths I wouldn't
go to the 24 26 or 28 until the company
decides or figures out their plan on how
to fix the shedding problem because that
was a major problem that I received with
this hair other than that I don't get
any tangling from the hair the hair is
very nice it has a good luster it does
tend to dry up a little bit but like I
said it was already processed to 1 b613
so you're not gonna get here that's
absolutely glossy or anything like that
so you basically have to add your a
little bit a little bit of moisture to
it just to keep it nice and balanced
but that's like I said to you guys I
just like it like this like you can just
like pop it up like this Jose it up a
little bit and for me this looks great
it looks like it looks like a really
natural look and it looks effortless
which I like so yeah other than that
guys I'll give this hair company about
maybe like an 8.5 they do need to kind
of fix a little bit their kinks with
their hair other than that they do well
I see a lot of people purchasing the
hair and like I said I want to lie to
you guys it does shed and I do and I do
see that as a major problem with the
hair company but like I said all hair
shed so you don't expect that you're
gonna get here that's not going to shed
because that's a lie
so it is what it is like I said I'll be
contacting the company just to give them
a little bit of an update what I think
I'm not even sure that they know that I
actually made these videos for the
company well for the color and
everything
that but I'm pretty sure they're pretty
happy with their sales right now so
whatever and yeah guys so I will be
continuing my affordable hair series for
