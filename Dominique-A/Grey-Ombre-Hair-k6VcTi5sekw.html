come by today and talk to you guys about
my hair
I've been posting pictures on Instagram
and a lot of people been commenting
about my hair color so I just want to
come and talk to you guys about the hair
company and everything so I purchased
this hair file express and is from my
hair company called Karina hair company
and I was not sent this here for a
review or anything like that I just
wanted to buy some hair and I wanted to
color some hair so I purchased this here
in the color 1 b613 which means it's
natural black at the tip and it's
bleached blonde at the ends so um
basically what I wanted to do is go for
some type of a colored look and I wasn't
really going for the gray ombre but I
kind of stumbled upon it during my
colouring process I did go to Sally's
and buy a couple items and the major
item that I used to achieve this color
was the Weller charms t14 and I know if
you guys can see this clearly if my
camera focuses in but this is a wily
charms t14 and this is in the color pale
ass blonde and this is a cog that I used
to get this gray look when I was dying
in here I noticed that um I was trying
what Apple's trying to do is trying to
tone the hair down but in my mind I'm
thinking like okay I'm gonna tone the
blonde hair done you really can't tone
blonde hair down I don't know what I was
thinking
but I ended up talking like this so at
least it turned out to be something
that's actually nice because I'm really
excited cuz I never in like a million
years thought that I was going to go and
do the gray ombre trend but with my luck
I ended up achieving this look and I
know for some people out there they say
that it's really really hard to get the
gray look but I'm gonna tell you guys
right now this is probably the easiest
way to do this like I said if you go out
to south and pick up a couple of these
if you're doing four bundles in a
closure which I have installed right now
in a dome cap you want to get four boxes
of the Weller charms t14 to get the gray
look
if you're going to die here and you want
it to be great the best thing for you
guys to do is get here that it's already
platinum blonde if the hair is platinum
blonde it takes the color like this not
only gray it'll take blue pink and a
wide spectrum of colors very easy versus
dyeing dark hair bleaching dark hair and
then taking a Greg it's very impossible
to it's not impossible but it's very
studious and it's very long and hard
process so if you do want to dye your
hair gray it's better for you to start
off with platinum blond hair which would
be color 613 so I'm really excited about
this because I didn't think that this is
gonna work out this way and like I said
I'm not doing a review for the company
but for all you girls out there that do
shop off my Aliexpress and love
affordable virgin hair this is probably
a website you should look at if you're
willing if you're trying to do a wig
like this or you want to do a hairstyle
like this I got four bundles
I got a 18 20 22 and 24 inch and I also
got a 14 as closure at the top and I
installed a dome cap and everything so
this was probably like one of the
easiest units ever because it legit took
me like an hour to make it and I did
Collyer before putting it on the the
wakes already knew what the result
looked like before and yeah and I took
paid two hundred forty-one dollars for
this hair and it is absolutely amazing
the only thing I noticed about this hair
does shed but you guys think about it
the hair is processed so therefore you
are gonna get some split ends at the end
and stuff like that but I don't see that
as a problem the hair is very full I did
all the hair on a dome cap I use all
four bundles in closure and this is the
ending result and I absolutely love it
guys it's so pretty and so nice I don't
know if you guys could see the texture
if you'll probably see a couple of
blonde specks in here just because I did
I think I don't think I really got
finely in there but I'm pretty sure I
got it covered
like for the majority of the hair so
yeah and sorry guys I got my boobs out
today but you know I haven't done a blue
ball a boob flog in a while so I want to
show you guys what they look like
anyways just in a shirt that actually
has like a little bit of a cut but yeah
so that wraps up the video guys I hope
