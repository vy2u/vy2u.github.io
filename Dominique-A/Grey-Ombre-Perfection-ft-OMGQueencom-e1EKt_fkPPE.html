with another with Wednesday video so in
today's video I'm going to show you guys
a wig from omg Queen here calm now I
work with them previously before so I
decided to work with them again
so today's unit is a grey styled unit so
let me show you guys who I'm gonna brush
I'm gonna left so this is the unit right
here guys and is a very very very shiny
style unit it is 18 inches long and it
comes with your standard cap so you get
three columns at the top one at the base
and an adjustable strap now this wig is
very good on my head so if you're
looking for a small size head just
follow my guidelines for my unit and it
actually fit perfectly fine if you do
have a bigger head I would say keeping
regular size and just adjust the straps
but thinking of I did adjust my strap so
that's probably why my sister is very
good I'm not going to put an elastic
band on just because it fits my head
perfectly so I don't have to go the
extra mile they did already put like a
pre part into it and I hate these pre
parts because they're so like why this
is don't work so I'll probably just try
to put some pod over or probably just
turn this into a side part but what I'm
not going to do with this unit is leave
it the way it is just because it looks
kind of funny and shiny so what I'm
going to do is probably add like a nice
beach wave in it and then I will top it
off with some dry shampoo or texturizing
spray just because it is a little bit
shiny and synthetic like but this is
actually a hundred percent human here so
yeah so if you guys are interested in
seeing what this unit looks like on me
today I would like you to stay tuned and
keep on watching alright guys so this is
what the hair looks like final I just
went in a crimson and I will insert in
the video right here an example of when
I crimp my hair i made a video for it so
i'll slide it in here somewhere and i
also link it down below for you guys so
if you guys don't know how to deep waves
in here now for the color I'm kind of
like neck over all over the place just
because I noticed that when I do play
heat on it
they kind of give me like a yellow tinge
with mixed with the gray I don't know if
it's from the heat it was on high
settings but I'm not sure if that's why
it did that to me but I do really like
those guys it looks very very pretty the
hair is 18 inches long so it just comes
right below the bread line and it just
looks really nice I kind of feel like I
was like the ice princess which is funny
this is definitely still trending for
how festival season stuff like that and
it does compliment my skin complexion
really well which I like I just was a
little afraid in the beginning that I
was going to be too strong but I think
that this looks good and it's working
excellent now I will leave all the links
down below for you guys if your interest
may be interested in this unit don't
forget to thumbs up this video guys
leave your comments down below and also
subscribe if you haven't guys and I will
catch you later on another wig Wednesday
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
