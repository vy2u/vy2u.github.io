barely outside
I don't want always with love
it's no sweet cheese to leading us is
all will ever trust ya know I don't
always would
we'll go
through wastelands through the highways
from eyeshadow through the sun rays and
I phoned away melodies we haven't played
I don't wanna know
go in around these walls to create a
song through the wastelands through the
highways through my shadow through the
sunrays and
alright guys so this is the unit from
China lace looks calm now I'll leave all
the description down below for this
exact unit stock style and all that what
I can tell you guys it is a 360 wig it
is body wave texture and it's 22 inches
long now this is definitely true to
length if I did join this out to be a
little bit longer but it's perfect at
this length it comes right below your
breasts I absolutely love this unit guys
the fact that it was already it already
came to me kind of curled made it easier
all I had to do was go in with my
curling iron and just add some curls in
the front and kind of flatten out some
of the rigid parts that came with the
unit once I Pat unpackaged it but I
think so far it looks absolutely
terrific guys it has a nice pretty
luster it's not nappy it's not really
hard to manage now I did not receive any
tangling with this or shedding so far so
this is day one so I will come back and
tell you guys all what I think about it
finalized bow so far I think it's a
really really nice guys it's definitely
a low maintenance type of style now for
this one I'm probably gonna say this for
the rest of this year so this is
definitely a holiday unit like if you're
like every single month after this it's
kind of like a holiday holiday holiday
holiday holiday holiday holiday so I'm
gonna kind of compare a lot of these
units in my next coming up videos to
holiday style units this is definitely
like a really nice pretty holiday look
if you're going to a party a Christmas
party Thanksgiving party Halloween party
so this is definitely a really nice
classically sexy unit I didn't dye it I
just took it off the pack cut the lace
off playing around with it I like I
usually do and add some curls in it now
I'm going to just show you guys what the
back looks like
so like I said guys this is definitely
an a.1 type of wig I love China lace
wigs calm they do have a wide variety of
selection on units for you guys if you
guys are interested they do have
affordable units and some units that
will range up to the 3s but keep in mind
if your pockets ain't there just select
the ones that are inexpensive and that
are great now I will leave all the
