going to be a curvy slash plus-sized
Tryon home and I've recently been doing
a lot of these while my hair is like
crazy I recently been doing a lot of
these videos on my channel the last
video that I did got a lot of positive
feedback so I decided to show you guys
some more of my fashion items today this
is going to be different because this
video is going to be your roots
crown haul so I got a lot of more items
that I'm showing you guys today and
excuse my remove you guys see things
like around the floor it's just been a
crazy holiday season and before I
continue happy Holidays to you guys and
I'm really excited today because today
is December 27th and it is my birthday
my 26th birthday so I'm in a good mood
hopefully this video goes down goes up
tonight or maybe tomorrow but I would
still be accepting birthday wishes all
month long guys so yes so if you're
interested to see what I got to show you
guys today I want you to stay tuned and
keep on watching
ok jumping right into the video guys I'm
going to start off with something that I
thrifted from BAE's closet so this is a
jacket that I got from BAE's closet um
he wasn't using it anymore so I just
took it you know he gave it to me you
know he was nice I begged him for it for
a couple weeks and he finally gave it to
me so this is a jean jacket and it's
kind of one of those oversized jean
jackets and men's this is a size large
and it's from American Eagle Outfitters
and he had this for a while um so I just
decided to take it now it is a really
nice jean jacket guys I love the color
of the Jean material itself it's one of
those light wash jean jackets that's why
I really gravitated towards this a lot
um one thing I did is I did add some
accessories on mines
I know the whole patches and pin thing
is really cool so I went to Spencer's at
my local monde I picked up four of these
um cool little clips or whatever I don't
what do you call them like um whatever
you know you know what I mean guys so
I'll show you guys this is a girl from
Bob's burger which is one of my favorite
TV shows to watch I am a Capricorn as I
said in the beginning of the video and
this one says Keep Calm cause love is
love and you know I support my LGBT crew
and savages Fox so I was just picking up
these things and I thought these were
really cute to put on the jacket to make
it look really vintage II and really
kind of personal because that kind of
represents me right here so yeah so this
is a jacket I really like this jacket
guys it's really cool it's oversized
and you can just pair it off with a lot
of things so I really really wanted this
and I got it so the next item I'm going
to show you guys is a jacket that I
purchased from TJ Maxx now this jacket
is in a size 1x and I know I'm not a 1x
I'm putting fairly little extra large
sometimes wear large and extra-large
depending on the size of the arms if the
arms are too tight and they're like that
really tight material I'll have to do an
extra large so this is a 1x but I know
you guys know by widest you balance in
1x
I bought this in a 1x for the style I
really liked an oversized jacket bomber
jacket longline environment jacket style
and I featured a bomber jacket like two
videos ago two hauls ago that I really
liked but this one is really really nice
guys this is a really kind of like a
matte bomber jacket it's like not matte
you know what I mean it's not like one
of those silky bomber jackets like a
matte type bomber jacket it does have
the orange trim in the inside of the
jack and it does have the black sleeve
paneling in the collar paneling as well
and this is from a company called love
tree and I got in a 1 X at t.j.maxx and
I pay $24.99 for this jacket guys so
this looks really good it's oversized
and you can really style it really well
make it look kind of like edgy you could
wear like a really tight dress
underneath or wear like a nice body suit
underneath and just put this on top with
like some sneakers or something and
that's just exactly what I was thinking
about when I saw this so I definitely
picked this one up because that was the
idea of the look that I had in my mind
so I'm really really pleased with this
jacket guys and it looks absolutely
great on you can start up anyway I like
oversized things sometimes just because
it looks really really cool so the next
thing I got is from vu and this is just
one item that I got my sister ordered
some stuff so I just picked out one
thing out of it that I wanted boo has
pretty inexpensive things I've already
told you guys to be videos before you
got to be careful when you're wonderful
boo boo because sometimes their
materials a little iffy so this is just
a longline sweater that I got and it's
in the size medium to large usually
sometimes it's like oh it's one size
fits all never trust a company that says
one size fits all because if you're big
it ain't gonna fit now this is called
Alexa belted duster cardigan and it's in
gray medium or large
I'll list down this below I'm not sure
how much it was but usually boo hoo has
40 to 50 percent off sometimes so it's
probably like $10 or $15 or $12 you know
what I'm saying so it's really cute the
great
it is see-through so be careful if you
try to wear something skimpy underneath
is the one thing I don't like about this
it's not really one of those real
cardigans I really wrap over it kind of
sits right where your hips are and it
kind of looks funny so um I would just
wear this like and at least sometimes I
wouldn't consider this like a major
piece or whatever but hey it works
so the next thing I'm going to show you
guys are a couple things I got from
forever 21 now these are dresses I was
looking for dresses for the holiday
season so I just wanted to pick up some
items just trying on so the first
dress that I got from forever 21 is this
really cute bodycon dress now this
bodycon dress is like this coral peach
color it does have like a little pattern
on the front like a little line on the
front to kind of accentuate the body in
the middle I really like this dress guys
I think it's it's a it's kind of like
over the knees a little bit but if you
have a bigger butt that's just gonna
roll up when you're walking so you got
to be very careful with dresses like
this but if you know what you got and
you want to work at work in so I
definitely wear this and I do not wear
this with a bra I know I mean like if
you if you're comfortable not wearing
with the bra I don't wear with the bra
like my boobs just stay up anyway so I
don't really feel like I need to wear a
bra with it anyways so and if you guys
do know my boobs are fake people so um
this is really cute and I really like
this so I got this in a size let's see I
got this in a size large and this was
ten bucks people ten dollars so yeah so
the next thing that I got is another
dress from them and this dress I
actually bought so spend a couple stains
on it so I'm gonna hold it from a
distance so you guys will try to come
for a bitch so this is another just that
I got and it's kind of one of those
color-block dresses and has like the
padded breast part adjustable straps and
it is kind of like a above the knee
length I absolutely love this dress guys
it looks absolutely good especially for
body types like mine's if you're really
pear-shaped and curvy like me and got a
little booze at the top this dress looks
absolutely good I do much to color what
is a little bit different where the tan
is that it feels like a different color
it will be so poppin but this color
looks really good on me so I would
definitely say go out and check out this
dress it does have little gold detailing
in the back which is nice because I'm a
gold person this dress is a plus people
I love this dress love this
yes so the next thing that I got from
forever 21 is let me show you guys
before zip down real quick so the next
thing I got from forever 21
are these heels I'm a heel person but
I'm not a male person to the extreme I
will no wear heels are going to kill me
if I go out
so these heels that I got right here and
kind of like some cat some kitten some
kitten heels they're brought 3 inches
long 3 inches high
and they're not like anything
extravagant these look really good guys
and I would say if you're just trying to
wear some like regular jeans like a
jacket like a jean jacket leather jack
and just trying to do like a little heel
thing wait like don't look for like a
little lunch or something like that and
you don't want to be overdramatic I
think that these heels work very well
they don't hurt like that I mean they
don't hurt i warn't like 4 4 to a half 4
and 1/2 inch heels like and those hurt
like these are really nice and subtle
they don't hurt as much as your 5 inch
heels and I just think they're nice
classic black and it's a little it's
like kind of like a nice velvet material
and I picked these up for $20 at forever
21 the next thing I got is this cute hat
and you guys know I show you guys hats I
like hats it's my thing so this is a hat
that I got for 9090 centrum from forever
21 and this hat says babe on it I
 love this hat so F&amp;amp;Q it says
babe and it's just like this is the type
of hat you wear if you just like wearing
kicks leggings and a sweatshirt and
maybe like a jean jacket little tank top
underneath but this is so cute and it
says babe and I love this I think this
is just I might even wear this for the
rest of the video because it's just that
damn cute so I really like this guy's
and I think that you know mm-hmm you see
that little brown blonde here at the
bottom Wow okay so the next place that I
went to is Primark and I went to Primark
in Danbury Connecticut I live in north
kinetic even you guys know that and
damper is like 45 minutes from where I
lived so I did drive up to go to Primark
it's the only one in Connecticut so I
was really excited about that so I went
I might even go tomorrow to the one in
the city ah so so the first thing I'm
still got some Primark that I got are
these really cute centi inspired shoes
they're really sold out online I would
have probably got myself a real pair but
they're sold out online so it's kind of
extremely hard to find these shoes so I
decided to buy the knockoff
under the kind of Primark ones so these
are the shoes and they're like you can
see the bottom is like that tan platform
creeper style shoe I love shoes like
these aren't worth creepers I had like a
creeper phase like two years ago I just
wore creepers all the time so I decided
to continue the trend guys so this is
what it looks like guys and they're like
a it's kind of like a khaki Mattia color
on the top I don't know what kind of
color to explain but these were 17
dollars and I got these in a size C size
9 or 8 I think these are size 8 and I
really like these guys these are cool
just to wear with like bodysuit maybe
even I would wear this actually with my
bomber jacket a body suit and maybe a
ponytail and this will just go well with
the head to actually be really human
self yeah so I really like these and
those are about 17 bucks from Primark so
the next things I got from Primark are
these cute little hats I'm a Isle of
hats
I love these tax especially the ones
with the pom-poms at the end so I got
this really cool mustard color I think
this goes really nice for the wintertime
and I also got this black one right here
which I just basic black let me show you
guys I really wanted to wear this I'm
gonna take this off and show you guys
with these hats look like so I'll just
try on the black one for you guys the
black one is so cute guys you guys can
see the pom-pom at the top like come on
that's like F&amp;amp;Q right there like let's
go
so this hat is really really cute guys
and I just think it's really cute just
to wear in the winter time you know
style it up whatever way you want and I
just think it looks so fun and the
mustard one as well and I actually want
to try to muster went on because I'm
just that much of a damn dork so I'm
going to try the mustard went on to and
oh my god this is so cute like and this
actually goes really nice with my
highlighted here right here so yeah I
just think this is so cute guys and
maybe I'll wear this for the rest of the
video okay so the next thing I got from
Primark is this cute little jacket now
this is kind of like a sweater kind of
garment thing it has a fur trim on it I
really like this guys and my sister was
like to me what the hell why are you
buying that like it's a little much but
sometimes you got to be daring you know
so this is kind of like a throw over a
hoodie like a sweater or whatever and it
has this fur trim on the back of the
collar and the reason why I like this so
much is the pairing of the fur and the
burgundy color go perfectly together
like this is statement right
now I think I was good think I'm gonna
actually wear this on New Year's with
some jeans a turtleneck shirt and some
heels and keep it real classy and stray
I am NOT doing the club scene this year
I'm probably gonna just do a little
dinner or whatever so I think that this
will be a really nice outfit just to
wear for dinner so I was really excited
when I saw this and this was actually on
sale at Primark this was let's see what
it tags in this was only dad they bit
the price up I think this was
like 10 bucks I don't remember but it
was really expensive in inexpensive and
that's why I got it so that's that the
next thing that I got from Primark I'm
gonna dip down sorry guys so I got this
really cute choker I'm gonna try this on
I mean you guys know what chokers look
like come on hello
so this cute little choker has at this
beaded material in front I just like
it's like a rose gold color with
diamonds in it I just thought that this
was so cute and this was only six bucks
so I picked this one up too I just
thought it was really cute guys so I
really wanted it so I got it
the next thing I got this really cool
dress this has been trending a lot and
it's kind of like the the t-shirt with
the tank top dress on top I've just been
a big fan of it so I decided to get it
so it's just basically like a long long
long long dress that hits about your
ankle it's a black tank top dress
spaghetti chef chest and it also comes
with the little t-shirt at the bottom
now primer cast sales and you guys
wouldn't believe how much I got this for
three bucks people and not three bucks
for the t-shirt three bucks for the
entire set so this was a really really
good deal I really really really like
this guys like on all honesty I really
really like this it looks great on and I
could just pair it with anything
sneakers and I'm telling you guys I
would kill these real quick so I really
thought this is a good deal really good
buy it was only three bucks so the next
item that I'm gonna show you guys is
from fashion Nova now this is just a
dress that I picked up the whole New
Year's thing for me is kind of getting
bored like I told you guys before and I
was kind of certain to what I was gonna
do I didn't know if I was in to go to a
club or do something like that so
because I'm just probably gonna have
dinner and that's it I'm not gonna get
dressed up so I'll save this for another
occasion or some type of event so this
is a dress that I pick up for fashion
Nova it's really cute and you know I was
like this little see-through part right
here
and it's kind of like a knee-length
dress and it is a size large and I got
this for I think was like $32
it was $29.99 and as the militia dress
um in black and yeah I'd like it simple
it just has a little bit of style in the
front if you trying to show you know a
little something some but I like it I
thought it was cool so I got this from
fashion over I think there's some other
stuff of fashion although but
fashionable is very funny with their
sizing and stuff so some of the things I
had to return so I'll come back with
another haul video with some more
products that I got from fashion over
once I figured out their sizing
because they're just so damn confusing
especially if you're not skinny skinny
like the models on there I'm nothing
like them they're way skinnier than I am
so yeah so the next thing I'm going to
show you guys is some sneakers that I
got
so the first sticker that I got is
adidas superstars I really like adidas
superstars I thought they were really
cute and trendy so I was trying to wait
while just to see which one I wanted I
was going to get the all-white ones but
I decided just to go to the classic
black and white so these are the Vita
superstars
they're really cute guys I wear size
six-and-a-half in big kids
which would mean six and half and boys
and the women's would be like a eight I
guess or eight and a half that kind of
size so I thought these were really cool
really nice and fresh and I definitely
could wear these sneakers with that
black and white dress with the tank the
tank top the layer dress
I didn't I'll be really cute and even
with this hat and a jean jacket or
leather jacket Wow
yeah sorry last but not least is my last
pair of shoes that I'm going to show you
guys so the last push shoes that I got
are the vans
I have like a huge van collection but I
don't have low top ones like this so I
decided to pick up these vans now these
vans are a size six and a half and these
aren't kids or I think it's big kids or
boys and I like I said I'll do the size
conversion I'll link everything down
them for you guys so these are the black
and white vans I love vans I have the
high-top hot pink ones and I do have the
all red ones who's just really cool I
like them a lot so I got these as well
