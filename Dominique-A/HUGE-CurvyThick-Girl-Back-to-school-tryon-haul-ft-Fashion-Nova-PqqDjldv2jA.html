today is going to be another Kirby
plastic girl trying on video and today's
video will be showing you guys some
clothes from fashion over calm now
today's theme is back-to-school so this
month I'll be showing a lot of
back-to-school themed videos including
fashion hair and makeup so I'm really
excited about this month in this video
today if you're interested in seeing
what I have to offer in today's video
guys I would like you to stay tuned and
keep on watch so the first thing I'm
going to show you guys today is this
really cute dress now this is a jean
dress that looks absolutely stunning on
now I notice that a lot of the other
curve plus girls who've done reviews
professional it's back to school drama
they've also reviewed the same dress too
so we all was thinking alike now it's a
really cute dress it does have a great
detailing down the center it has a gold
buttons down the center it does have
kind of like these floating please on
the side which I really think are cute
and it's just as simple just whether you
could dress it up or down it just works
all the way around you can wear a
cardigan jean jacket leather jacket when
I jean jacket leather jacket you can do
jean jacket too and it's just a piece
that you can kind of wrap together and
kind of make it look really really good
so I picked this one out and this one is
a size extra large and just to mention
most of my clothes came from fashion /
curves I think I got one item just for
the regular size and the next thing I
have to touch show you is another pic
like jean style outfit so the next thing
is guys these are the only pair of pants
that I got that are Jean now these are
the Khloe Kardashian inspired Bermuda
shorts or whatever so they're really
cute I got these in a size 1 X makes it
very good very nice on the body the one
thing that's sold on these jeans is the
color it's like a light distressed right
here this is kind of like a medium wash
style Jean which I absolutely love
now these pants are size 1x and I have a
pair like this from a different company
in there are size extra large I actually
felt like the extra large ones are fit
bigger than the ones from fashion / and
the ones from fashion / size 1x
these look really good on they
definitely fit the body real nice and
these are the type of jeans like I said
these are the types of jeans you can
dress up or dress down so if you're
going out on like a day
these are wearing heels with it or if
you just want you could if you're just
going to school as the videos
you can just wear sneakers or sandals
and keep you pushing I just think that
these are so cute they fit really nice
they're high-waisted pants very secure
feeling and they just look really really
good so I definitely recommend you guys
check these out they are they're just
like everything and they definitely
aren't a pair of pants or pair of jeans
that you would want to have it you think
I got is this really long line duster
Jean duster now I'll show you if you
like to see you come in the clip it's
really hard to see it if I hold it up
now this is a really really nice duster
guys and I love it so much because it is
Jean now it doesn't have a belt it
doesn't really have a lot of
accentuating kind of like next into it
it doesn't have like a lot of details on
it so it's kind of really plain so the
good thing I like about this one is that
you can pair this with like a waist belt
you can wear it with like a basic up
underneath or wear with a dress stuff
outfit so this is something I definitely
wear to school it's just something real
basic something to kind of bring your
fashion up or just kind of tie the
fashion together and I just thought it
was really cute you can wear it with
like a cat suit or one of those fashion
ovah nova suits it would just be really
cute and sneakers or you can wear heels
with it sandals
it just goes extremely far and I just
think that this is so cute and I just
have to pick it up now this one is in a
size 1x and if it's perfect now if you
do have bigger arms like bigger arms in
this I highly recommend you get a size
up just because my spit is it it wasn't
you know it's funny it wasn't that at
all it just fit I'm just saying a fit so
if your arms are bigger than mine is
definitely say get a size 2x because
you'll probably be you know stretching
it out I definitely lift my arm up and
do a couple kick plug flaps in it so
it's it but if you do have bigger arms
in my arms I would just recommend
getting a size 2x just because you might
have a little bit trouble in the army
the next thing I got is a really basic
item now this is kind of one of those a
little jumpsuit thingies that you kind
of like hop into it is kind of like a
bermuda style it comes like above the
ankle a below the ankle and it's just
like a tube top style jutsu I really
like these because these are so plain
that it's so easy to style these like
you can definitely dress this up or just
as down and if you're running late to
school or whatever if you're running
late in isn't or whatever all you have
to just put
on and keep it pushing I'm starting to
regret to be face but you got an outfit
so this is something that I like it's
really simple it's very very stretchy
guys I got this one in a size extra
large and this is the type of thing I
would wear with the Duster just because
it goes together you can even you could
wear this with sneakers the Duster in a
little book bag or something and just be
cute or you can wear the Duster this
some heels and some hoops and jazz it up
I'm always formulating these ideas in my
head about like an outfit I don't know
what you guys do I'm saying there's ways
to always bring this up or down meaning
you can dress it up or dress it down so
I definitely think this is something I
would recommend you guys getting these
are really easy to wear and really even
next thing I got is just like a really
plain style top now it's plain because
it's just a solid color but it does have
a perfect detailing on the front now I
would hold this up to me but once I hold
right up to me it kind of watches me the
hell out so you guys will see the clip
come up now so it's a really cute top
guys I just it's like an oversized top I
think if I want to check in a gutter
size large and medium in this one it is
a bit oversized I picked this one up in
the sides let's see I think this is a
size large or extra-large let's see I
got this one in a size extra large and
it looks it's really good the material
is very soft on this item it's really
soft and I like the fact that it gives
like it's a simple white shirt but it
gives like this really cute little
design in the front area which I thought
that was nice so I definitely recommend
buying this if you want to wear like
kind of oversized get the signs up but
extra large for me is I consider that
oversized and I wear so if you want to
do an extra lesson too oversized it's
cute you can definitely oh my god just a
relaxed outfit with leggings and
sneakers oh my god I love stuff like
that a jean jacket so I definitely would
recommend getting this is just really
simple them it's like a really really
soft shirt like it feels so soft and
it's simple so I definitely would
recommend getting this one and it is
definitely one of those kind of chill
looks but it kind of gives you a little
bit of design with that little collar
part so it's cute now the next thing I
got is this cute crop top and I think
this is the only crop top I got now like
I said again guys holding white up is
just a mess so yeah so I'll show you
guys it looks like now now this is
really cute guys it's a
crock top and it says clean on it I just
thought that this so cute the one thing
I like about it it kind of has like
almost like a designer feel from the
where it says Queen like I don't know if
it's like Gucci Gucci Beck's linen is a
Gucci I think just like some Gucci since
Bern style I'm saying it does the thing
about this crop top though is if you
have a really had your titties like what
I mean heavy to emulate tees that come
out like boom if you have heavy titties
and you try to lift your arm up you're
definitely get some blue bitch leak I
have to be cord that Tron section like
three times because my fist came kept
coming out which is kind of like Dom so
I definitely do that off the video but
this is really cute it's the way I
stopped in this video I would like a one
of those the suede skirt and like a
cardigan sweater and they'd the colors
were similar but they didn't match and
but it kind of essentially is a little
tan part on the gold the gold part here
such as I was cute like alpha spice a
good is simply style it with like just
like mix-and-match stuff and I just
thought it was so cute I just I
absolutely love that outfit by the way
and that's enough that I put together so
I loved it so much so that's how I
probably would wear this laptop
unpopular I've seen a lot of people
reviewing this dress so I wanted to jump
on the bandwagon and try this dress out
just cuz I was that well I want to see
how it's going to look on me so I got
this dress cause I got this dress in a
size extra large and it's called the
puppy love dress and I will insert
everything down below for you guys if
you guys are interested don't worry so
this dress is really she was kind of
like I got the tan color they had black
and they had a different color so I
decided to choose the tan car just
because I thought it was a great
transition color for the winter or the
fall it does button all the way down so
you really have to either but pre button
this dress or button it was on which is
kind of silly so pretty button adjust
before you put it on because it will
cause less complication now it's really
cute it's kind of off the shoulder so
you can wear what I do mind is that kind
of like unbuttoned it a little bit in
the front so I can get like I don't even
get cleavage just a little bit of breast
meat out I just thought it was like sexy
obviously if I was going to squaw would
not be wearing like that I will button
it all the way up but like I said dress
up or dress down so if you want to dress
it up you pop that little titty out well
it's not like that guys but you just pop
a little chest out
and put some heels on but if you're
going to school you put like little
sandals on booties and then you know
what I mean guys I just thought it was
cute something very simple it is up it
on the sexy side but whatever you have
cursor reason so flaunt your little
curves no problem but I thought it Duffy
was cute so I picked this one out and it
just really fits really nice it's just
in material but it really looks really
good and even if you're like lumpy dumpy
frumpy who cares like whatever so I
definitely like it and I do wear
shapewear in somebody so like I said I
will insert the shapewear the first line
in the description bar will be the
shapewear line guys so I definitely love
this guys it's so soft so nice and it
looks so cute on now the next thing I'm
going to show you guys is another dress
that's a button-up dress but this one is
more of more of my kind of style I like
this elapses because it has a pattern so
I got this one which is like a tank top
version this is also size extra-large
now this one is so cute it's an army
fatigue style dress it also has the same
exact theme going on with a button-up
buttoned down but this one has a large
split at the bottom well you can button
it up but I left it like that because I
like to split it does have a split that
you can open up when I first got the
dress and presents me with the split so
I kept the split like that cause I
thought it was cute but for the purpose
is the school being appropriate but that
dress let up girl
stop trying to be sexy but it's really
cute guys I love this so much so pretty
and just fit really good accentuates the
curves perfectly you do get like a
little bit of boobies in it like a
little bit of cleavage but what I would
say is I would say what would be cute
with this one is putting like a
long-sleeve shirt underneath it like a
white shirt underneath it like a
long-sleeve white shirt underneath it
that would actually be so cute I should
do lookbook that would actually be
really cute so putting like a
long-sleeve shirt underneath this will
be cute so I got me recommend I don't
know something about this cute I wear
this with combat boots or Doc Martens
that will be so dope and ajit a leather
jacket so the next so the next thing I
got is really cute it's kind of sexy and
a little bit short when I first received
it I tried it on and it was it that
short so when I'm trying to Anam
little bit confused either I got like
taller or just got fat but this is what
it's basically it looks like a piece of
cloth like this guy's it's like
legitimately like this it doesn't have a
shape it doesn't produce a shape or
anything until you put it on now when
you put this baby on body is on point
you know what I'm saying
now this is a bit short so for this type
of dress I would say if you're going to
like a first dance homecoming you know
like all of them HBC Lizabeth
historically black colleges HBC HBCU
homecomings or whatever girl you come
out here with a little dress like this
and you be it like this is really cute
like I said it's one of those dresses
that you get it and it's just kind of
like block but then when you put it on
it sucks and pulled your body together
that's worth that so if you have like an
event to go to like one of the
homecoming things your first dance or
you know like what is it called hi this
is what you're going to want to wear for
that event so I recommend getting this
one it looks really good guys it
definitely fits and accentuates the
curves to the tee so I really really
like this I highly recommend this dress
for you guys I probably felt like in the
beginning that I could have size down to
a size large but I got a size extra
large and I'm perfectly happy with
extra-large it makes me happy it looks
good so I have no complaints over here
but this one
now the next just I got is a it's kind
of one of those mini dresses now this
one is really it's really different for
me because I wouldn't really wear this
that much because it's stripes and
strives to the same it to the wide it
makes you like this you know all these
freaking like ideas for people right big
or who are curvier or plus-sized
whatever I didn't want to fall back
trend so I decided to get this one now
it's reason why I like this a lot is
because it does have stripes on it but
if the black and white sex is really
trending now a lot of colors and
patterns are trending so I wanted to
kind of follow a trend a little bit so I
got this one and I'm so happy I got this
now this material is really thick it has
a double layer material where you kind
of like it has like a slit in it but not
really a slit so if you're kind of lumpy
dumpy and bumpy this one will not give
any exposure to that your
hiding your whole lumps bumps and dumps
nobody's going to ever see that so
that's one thing I absolutely love love
love about this dress guys
it will hide all the imperfections that
dimples in your butt cheeks and all that
kind of stuff it definitely covers you
and you're just I don't know I just love
this so much guys I just I just love it
so much it is a mini dress still goes
way below the knees and it's just you
know I didn't have to wear a bra with
that just put it on it just and fit so I
love this dress very simple perfect for
school perfect length perfect look it
just is perfect guys just perfect so the
next dress I got is actually one of the
sexiest dresses out of the collection
now like I said I was refrain from
wearing this to school as walking down
the hallways with it because it's just
not appropriate whatsoever but this is
something I would recommend wearing to
homecoming or you know poinsettia
mistletoe and I think kinetic I think
we're the only ones in Connecticut that
do that so Pierre from Connecticut and
you live in Fairfield County you know
what poinsettia and mistletoe is it's
just an event that they do they're the
holidays but if you have those kind of
events but don't kind of many little
dances at school you can definitely get
away with this or maybe like at a high
school I'm a college party or something
like that
so this is the next dress guys I oh my
god
this dress is super sexy they should
have called this dress they should have
called this dress look back at it like
my cheeks look really good in this dress
I don't know it's really sexy all that
reminds me like a Kim Kardashian dress
that she wore I'm not sure the best
thing about this dress is the kind of
ruching and then the light pattern that
they have underneath the color
combination is so cute and it looks
really good on like I really really like
this I got to synthesize extra-large
it is off the shoulder and it has kind
of like those ruffle parts in the top
part all together completely like
honestly and truly this dress is so nice
guys I definitely wear this at like a
formal event or event that's kind of
like them kind of like something where
you can be sexy yet even if you're going
out like after like you going out with
your friends after college college class
and you guys go in a college class if
you must meet some friends in college
you guys are going out like one night or
whatever you could definitely wear this
out
a little club or something it's just a
really cute and expensive I just I just
love it so much you know what I mean
guys it just does it for me this is
doing it for me two minutes and I just
really think it's going to show you guys
it's a two piece set for fashion over
now it's really cute guys they have a
lot of two-piece sets and I'm not really
into 2-piece words just because it kind
of cuts you funny and I just I don't
know it's just really weird to me I feel
like these two pieces like I don't know
I just I don't know I don't know I'm not
really a Santa but I decide to try this
one out so it's a it's a cute little one
it's like a blue tie blue white and blue
pink
Wow colored line it's blue yellow and
white like tie-dye theme now this is
what the skirt looks like guys it's
matching set I think it's really cute I
like the tie-dye effect that they did to
its what I really liked about this a lot
that's why I picked it out it does have
like a little picture in the front I'm
not sure what the picture is I have to
actually make it out like I don't need
to know I don't know what the picture is
it's a girl power oh my god I realize
that so this is a crop top it's kind of
like a little off the shoulder crop top
I just thought it was really cute now I
got this in a size extra large if you
have a lot of vm's in the top right here
you'll probably have a little bit of
discomfort with this one it is a little
bit stretchy but it's stretchy to an
extent because of the writing pattern in
the front so if you are breasts full and
you might want to get like a center you
can even split the size you just I would
just say size up I'm not sure if this is
sold separately don't quote me on it but
I would say get this top and a bigger
size and get the bottom and your regular
normal size because this set together is
extra large and the bottom fit good and
the top fit good too but like I said if
you were really busty I would definitely
recommend sizing up but I thought this
was really cute something fun to wear
you definitely wear this to school kind
of bring down the crop top down a little
bit you don't want too much belly
exposure so you don't get suspended but
it does the job so guys that binky wraps
up this video I hope you guys enjoy this
fashion over back to school try and haul

more try and haul back to school themed
