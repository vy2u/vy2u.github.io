another curvy /big girl trying on video
so in today's video we show you guys
items from Primark forever 21 and Ramu
is calm now I will try to link all the
items down below for you guys you guys
already know Primark does not have an
online store so those links will not
exist but if you live near Primark
I'm in Connecticut and there's the
closest product for me is in Danbury
Connecticut so if you live near a
Primark I definitely advise you to go
out and check them they definitely
provide the most inexpensive quality
filled items ever and I'm in there like
crazy so definitely check them out as
far as 5 or 21 I'll kind of have to
sharp the website to find it because I
bought these items in store but you get
the gist of it you get the idea
everything looks pretty inexpensive now
I got a lot of clothes to romwe so I'm
really excited about that
I will be leaving for Jamaica in 8 days
so I'm taking some of these items with
me and it's going to be a liddie so if
you're interested in seeing what I have
to offer in this trial all today I would
like you to stay tuned and keep online
so I kind of like watch the intro report
and like I want them so again Susie
astok it's so embarrassing so hope you
guys and I noticed I talked fast oh my
god I was embarrassing ok so the first
place I'm going to start off with is
Rami calm so I'm going to start off with
the coat because there's a lot of
clothes I want to kind of get it out
there for you guys so the first thing
I'm going to show you guys is this two
piece set that I have now I have a
romper this style and I got the rapper
from new chic so I decided to get this
two piece now this is a short set with
its really cute ruffled off the shoulder
type crop top and it has like those
hanging shoulders we just stick your arm
in now I thought that this was a really
really cute guys now I got this in a
size extra large and the pants are the
shorts are kind of tight so they kind of
go up the crease of my back but I'm
going away to an island like who cares
it doesn't matter so I'm definitely
going to wear this regardless I thought
that this was so so cute
it looks really good on the body it kind
of didn't make you look lumpy dumpy
frumpy so you kind of looked it smooth
me out and I looked cute in it so I'm
definitely going to take this with me to
Jamaica if you do not want to wear the
shorts you can definitely wear the top
with like black shorts or something else
or
it was definitely cute I wish the
bottoms are size 2x and said extra-large
because they're not that I need them to
be a little bit more spacious for me
just because it's crazy-- down there now
the next thing I got is it's just this
plain dress now I have a dress like this
too and it's kind of weird cuz when I
picked this on the website I didn't
remember that I had a dress similar to
this not similar in style but similar
and pattern like the texture or the
material that they use so this is a
dress right here and it's really cute
the long sleeve dress is kind of like
those wide arms now this dress is very
simple this is something I wear to like
a like a like brunch or something very
simple nothing but it's like a basic
dress it does have this cute little
tassel design in the front which I think
it's cute this I believe is a size extra
large I try to keep from the size range
and extra large extra large depending on
the material now I'm telling you guys
this because I see the comments are you
guys saying how do you shop for the
sizes I take large risk when I buy stuff
on this website but one thing that I do
when I shop on this website is look at
the material check the material to see
if it stretches over doesn't stretch and
kind of figure polyesters going to
stretch so you got to be very particular
with that so I definitely look at the
sizing I look at the material to make
sure that it's going to be a go but this
is really cute very simple and I like it
a lot now the next one this is one of my
favorite ones and it kinda reminds me
the yellow dress from romwe that I tried
in my last ran haul that everyone loved
now this one is a really cute blue one
and it's a different pattern it has like
a different design in the back so the
back goes like this that is kind of like
a little strap hold in the back it has
like a low back in the back well back in
the back um so the front is cute guys it
has a dispensable silver and white
pattern like embroidery I think it's
really cute it is on the short side but
it's not too short where it's exposing a
lot I just think that this looks so
pretty to wear what flats it and just
like I love it so much I'm actually
starting to be in love with these types
of dresses just because they really
accentuate the curves and it doesn't
expose too much so you look really you
know put together and proper I think
that's the word now the next thing I got
from them is like a two-piece suit now
this is random
I got this because I thought about like
airport outfits and stuff like that
something I could wear on the go now
this is a two-piece set and it's a black
driver style pants now it's supposed to
be like a jogger saw pants well my size
and my legs are way too big so would
never be jogger on me so they just end
up being like leggings but it does come
with a elastic waistband like the little
string it's black and half pockets on it
which is a go it definitely makes the
booty look good which I thought was cute
and definitely it's really cute guys
it's not I'm not going to lie it's cute
I think I believe this is a size extra
large let me see it is a size extra
large now has this off the shoulder
style sweater so it comes off the
shoulder and it's really it gives like a
little bit of sex appeal
it gives it also a little bit more
flavor so I thought that this was cute
now yellow has definitely been my color
lately so I picked up this really pretty
yellow dress now it's nothing crazy this
is the type of dress that I would wear
if I had an occasion to go to like a
wedding baby shower or something like
really formally it's like a nice yellow
style dress and it has a really nice
detail around the off-the-shoulder
pattern here which i think is cute so
this is up with something I would
consider wearing to like a baby shower
or like something more formal not like I
want to bring this to Jamaica just
because it's not sexy Wow so the next
thing I got are some body suits can I'll
go through the body suits in a bathing
suit so these are probably like in the
same category so I'll go through these
first now the first body stood I got is
off the shoulder bodysuit and it's a
white one now I hate hosing white up to
the camera because it kind of fades my
color out so I'm going to try to hold
this up so you guys can see it so it's
like this white bodysuit like this now
it does come with a clasp at the bottom
and I will show you guys what it looks
like on I would think about showing you
guys that looks on without pants and I
was like damn that's going to be a lot
of ass I ain't trying to do that because
it was sent to this video now this is
really cute guys I think the off the
shoulder looks looks good this is a size
large or extra large I believe and it
fits like a glove so a definitely hug
sucks and tightens you up really nice
and this is a size large so I'm not sure
if they would emphasize XL but if they
went up to size XL you can get XL I
think the large fit perfect now
decided to get this bathing suit from
them too now this bathing suit is a size
large I could have gotten a size
extra-large but I wanted it to be tight
so that I could compress on me and that
it could be nice and when I wear it so I
should have thought about that because
it kind of really crushed my kids but I
like this one in the reason why I like
this swimsuit so much is because it said
Island vibes and I am going to Jamaica
and I'm really going to be in the island
vibe so I thought this was really cute
it's like a basic printed screen tea
type to a bathing suit I just really
really like this guy so I picked this
one out it is a size large it is a high
up now I call it the high crotch bathing
suit and I definitely need a wax my I
need to get a wax like next Thursday
because like it's I'm looking like real
like ferocious right now so I definitely
need to take care of that next Thursday
but it looks good but looks great bod
looks great so I'm definitely going to
wear this one to the all the events in
Jamaica cause I'm going for dream
weekend so that way a wild party
the funny thing I got is one of my
favorites
it's like killer major side boobs in
this one now this one is kind of one of
those like it kind of looks like a
bathing suit so if I kind of run out of
bathing suit to wear I'm just going to
wear this it's really cheeky guys like
oh my god it's like that so it's its own
style like this and it has it's like a
high cut high thigh guess you call it
now this one gives you major side boobs
and Jesse looks really really nice now
I'm going to wear this to Jamaica with
my high-waisted shorts I showed you guys
in this clip coming up or clip that one
short the green ones the high-waisted
green ones I'm going to wear the
high-waisted black ones with that too
the all-black party I'm going to and you
know I'm scum girl I'm going to you know
follow me
watch my snap stories that weekend the
weekend coming the weekend after next
week watch my snap stories watch my
Instagram stories and you better watch
my vlog because it's going to be lady so
I definitely thought that this was cute
in it guys it just gave you major boobs
now the next thing I got is kind of like
this knockoff inspired
Tommy Hilfiger and I hope I'm saying
Tommy Hilfiger as if I know that this is
Tommy Hilfiger like a knockoff so it's
best I think that this dress is so cute
expensive for like oh look books back to
school look books now it's basically
like a like a flag like an American flag
I intended another red white and blue
now I kind of mines into Tommy Hilfiger
style that they had now it's a bodycon
dress
I believe this one has been a size I
think I've got an extra large or large
to play it safe now this is it kind of
got loose I used my body shaper from
killer curves and I will link that down
below when I tried some of these items
on obviously the ones that have crop
tops I'm not going to wear a shaper with
that I'm just going to wear it regular
so I'll link down the body shaper down
below that I use for the trial and I
tried on some of my clothes so before
you guys go on a rampage or get crazy on
my ass and be linked down below so this
dress is cute guys I think it's a size
extra large and with the shape or it did
look a little bit big in the back I had
like a little bit of gapping in the back
but I think that this is so cute
definitely will be perfect for a
back-to-school look like with a jean
distressed jean jacket and some convert
oh that would be so cute guys so
definitely look out for a lookbook soon
now the next thing I want to show you
guys this is great dress that I got now
this great dress I thought it was really
simple and cute now the thing I really
liked about this was the
off-the-shoulder looked at it gave you
it gave me like a sense of elegant like
elegance well done that's really bad I
looked elegant if that's what I meant
guys but it's really cute I believe this
one is a size large I can't even find
the tags in here to see I believe this
one oh it is it's a size large guys and
it's an off-the-shoulder gray style
dress now I really like this one a lot
guys's because it was really elegant and
it had like a lot of stress appeal with
the off-the-shoulder look now this one
is it's kind of like a thicker material
so I definitely start wearing this in
the fall autumn season just because you
don't want to wear it now it's like 92
degrees outside and you will burn like
crazy so I would say this for later but
it is something I picked up because I
thought it was cute and it's a great
transition piece so that's definitely a
plus
now the next check
it's kind of like one of those dresses
that I haven't just sent to style
sometimes like what I really want to
wear something that's kind of like
relaxed this dress is the most relaxed
dress I've ever seen ever now it's kind
of you can do a lot to this so you can
definitely put a belt around the waist
in but I kind of felt like it's one of
those dresses like if you're just kind
of in a rush then you put some sandals
on some regular old slide sandals on in
this dress and it's just up it's just
heaven like so this is what the dress
looks like it's like a burgundy color it
does have two large splits on the side
and it's like a t-shirt dress with an
oversized t-shirt dress I absolutely
love this dress guys I don't know what
about it it's just so it's like an
effortless dress this is a size large so
you may want to size down but I just
going to keep it in this size because I
thought I wanted it to be loose and free
so therefore this clothing is not
sticking to me it's nice to wear tight
clothes sometimes but like sometimes you
want to wear stuff that's relaxed and
this is definitely like a relaxed
material it definitely is very
comfortable
and it's something I'm definitely really
hot days where I need to has a lot of
air coming through so I thought this was
cute now one of my favorite favorite
thing to miss China ha is this kimono
that I got oh it kind of looks like a
dress robe like you're going to like
like a shot like a robe like a robe at
home and it's so cute and I tried to
know what the body's to understand I
would never wear this without like a
bottom but I would definitely wear this
with like shorts or something like this
is so freaking cute I love the pattern
like I period it with the hat in the
video and I had a body in this video I
paired it with the hat and like the
bodysuit I probably wear shorts or the
black shorts too it just looks really
cute it does come with a little belt
around the waist but I'm not going to
use the waist well because then it looks
like a shower robe or like a house robe
so I'm just going to wearing without the
thing without the strip belt it has two
slits on the side which are excellent it
just looks so good
it just gives so much sex appeal and I
just feel really like grown and sexy in
this one so definitely check out the
kimono set selection there are a one oh
my god I'm so I'm so pleased at this now
the last thing I'm going to show you
guys clothing wise for this company is
this shirt that I have on now
now I'm going to show you what it says
now this shirt is so cute look wassup
guys so it says why be racist sexist
homophobic or transphobic when you kid
 just be quiet now I thought this
shirt was so cute you guys know I am a
lover of everyone I support the LGBT
community
that's just my community I'm part of
that community I'm just this to me I
just I just love this I'm being raped
like all this stuff is kind of like I
don't know I just love this t-shirt a
lot if you check Rob Lee she inside new
chic they definitely provide like a lot
of those clothes green teas that
actually have like defiant meanings to
it so I love picking those off just
because they're cool I would randomly
put the little cute ones that say like
little cute like frou-frou stuff but
that's like not my major thing to do I
usually like these really outspoken type
of shirts and I definitely going to wrap
this one all the time because this is
who I am
feminist so I definitely like this one
and if you like this you like the
message definitely pick this out this
will be linked down below and all of
that stress trees that I got I got is to
accessory from romwe so the first one I
got are these really cool shades now let
me try these on for you so the last time
I got these I got the red one so I
decided to get these yellow ones but
there are definitely a different shape
so these are what these look like oh
love it is so cute so they're kind of
like that yellow glaze like I can see
you guys and you guys are yellow and you
guys are looking at me like I'm knocking
a little bit my whole entire view is
kind of yellow so I think that these are
really cute guys like they're really
stylish amazing sunglass wear and
glassware but for the sake of the season
in the the style and you know this is
really trending I think that these are
these are pretty pretty it so I'm
definitely trying to pull these off in
the Sun when I go away maybe a few days
around here oh my god my contour is
really like rapport but yeah I just
think that these are cool so I think I'm
going to wear these when I go away so
definitely if you're looking for these
trendy open them up if you're looking
for like these trendy glasses definitely
check out romwe and a whole bunch of
those Asia websites I definitely have a
whole bunch now I got two pairs of shoes
from romwe the first was that I got are
these really cute sandals now I
sandals number one because of this part
now our love with Santa gives you like
an extra toe show off area so the big
toe will be here and it has like this
leopard print pattern in this gold chain
I'm a lover of gold I love gold jewelry
and gold accents everything like that
these are 39 which is an 8 I asked for a
40 which will be a size 9 a woman's 9
but the game is 239 instead of the 40
it's fine they fit I wish they were a
little bit bigger but they do justice
and what I can say is if you are pick up
this to decide so I can fit the egg but
I would feel more comfortable to 9 so if
you're an 8 and you're naturally the
natural ain't working you'll go for 39 I
think that these are so cute guys very
fashionable and just a little bit of
detail that they added on here it
definitely goes a long way you can
definitely wrap this one like all types
away now the next one I got are these
knock off kind of like Santi Puma
inspired shoes now I was going to
purchase the real ones well I was going
to kind my boyfriend in to buy them for
me but I got some different sneakers
instead so I decide to pick these out
now these are size 39 as well which will
convert into u.s. 8 and this is a UK 39
now these actually fit perfectly fine
without surprise well and they're kind
of like a crushed velvet and this is
kind of a cream velvet one thing that's
annoying is that the laces are so thin
but once I lace this up and kind of like
wear them I think they'll be really cute
I don't know I just like the whole kind
of platform thing and this is funny I'm
going to say this I used to be in love
with platform sneakers like three years
ago and my friends used to make fun of
me when I wear platform sneakers and
it's so funny now that it's becoming a
trend again to wear like those really
thick
platform style shoes because I was doing
that a long time ago and my friends used
to taste some fricking makes so much fun
of me but that's just my thing I like
that style like that kind of edge so I
used to wear that a lot so now I'm going
to show you guys some things I got from
Primark now I only got two items from
Primark and the two items I got from
Primark are just shoes now I went to
Primark and try some clothes on I wasn't
really feeling some of the things that
had and stop right now I felt like I was
repeating a lot of the styles that are
already hacks I kind of just said to
myself you know a domme fall back let's
go to the shoe section so I went to the
shoe section
and I found some really cute stuff now I
did have to replace one pair of my shoes
that I showed you guys previously and a
few a few houses all my dogs decided
that it was his item so he decided to
eat my shoes he's been from he just
turned one so he's been acting like a
baby lately trying to go back into his
old habits I don't know what's up with
him but it's just like what his birthday
was approaching he decided to go back to
his always with Pablo get it together so
I went back and got seized again now
these are those Birkenstock and spas
sandals if you follow me on several
Instagram and you watch my stories you
have already seen that I picked this up
now these are $7 these are my favorite
shoes like I wear these all the time
it's just comfortable really easy to
stop really they're really like nice and
easy to make a good look out of so I
definitely always purchase these and
these were $7 they're UK size 7 a US
size 9 Debbie pick these up now the new
one that I got are the these are really
popular those clear style sides now
these were only six dollars at Primark
guys six dollars and I got these in the
size 9 you guys already know like people
aren't selling these for $25 $15 and
like freaking $30 well we'll go for the
range from 15 and up now I'm not paying
15 enough for this this was six hours at
primer where are you going to buy me
okay I tell you guys if this I'm an avid
Primark shopper like like I said you
live by Primark and you're from
Connecticut girl go to the Danbury
Connecticut one I live all the way in
Fairfield County's on all the way
towards get it on towards New York and I
don't care I'll Drive to Dan beer just
to go to Primark so if you live in
Connecticut definitely check out Primark
they are legit like these guys $6 for
these guys is seven for the other so
those were not only two blocks from
Primark don't worry I'll be there after
I come Reverend Jamaica and I'll show
you guys some extra special stuff last
but not least I'm just going to show you
two items I got from forever 21 so I was
looking for themed dresses or colors for
the parties I'm going to in Jamaica so
it's kind of like picking out like
there's a red or white party and then
stuff like that so I have to find
something that was red and white like a
dress so I picked out this dress from
them
now I need to sit the back up in the
video because I'm
by myself I'm going to zip it up no
one's around here to help me so I just
kind of fixed it the way I couldn't hide
my hair so don't worry if it's guys now
it is a bit on the you know very body
concise so if you're kind of insecure
about like a lot of things like a buddy
nah I'm too fat like I'm fat like I just
I don't care anymore like I've already
told you guys and plethora of video and
is what it is like this world is
everyone of this was created different
like you can't I just I'm just
I used to stress out so much about being
a certain type of weight in this and
I've battled with weight for years I've
been big for years so I'm not new to the
dump true to this you know things I'm
kind of like why am i if I'm happy I
have friends family I have a boyfriend
that loves me why am I gonna stress
myself and kill myself up while I look
like I bought this dress it is a bit
tight and who cares I'm going rocket and
I'm going to rock it with confidence and
that's the key to everything in life
honestly and truly so anyways I'm going
off into the tangent so forget that so
this dress I got it's a size large it is
a little bit you know sucking you in but
it looks good I don't look like I'm
suffocating so like I said I linked on
the body armor I use for this one I just
use a zip up garment just to kind of
suck me in and shake me up real well now
it is so cute it definitely makes the
breasts look noise now it is kind of
like one of those criss cross up dresses
but it's not really it's just a design
on the outside it's not really something
you have to criss cross the block it
does have a zip in the back it does have
an adjustable strapping so if you want
to adjust the straps you can to bring it
your boobs up I didn't I just put them
on in mmm growls looking sexy and not
Jessie I was looking good but I really
like this this is size large and I
bought this for like 20 bucks and I
think it was worth it it's definitely
short so be wary but it is what it is
guys to be honest with you it just is
what it is
now the next thing I got I wore this one
time yeah where does one time 10 is that
I went to in New York and it is just
yellows my thing guys I've already told
you that so this is like a differing
y'all this is like a mustard color and
it's a jump it's like a romper like
whole entire jumpsuit now I absolutely
love this when I got in the size large
and this was about $20 as well from
forever 21 it is so freaking cute it's a
mustard color and for some reason this
yellow phase on me has been really well
these yellow colors look really good on
and look good on all skin but for some
reason African Americans skin to me on
myself it just looks it looks Nubian you
know what I'm saying it look real regal
and Nubian in it so I just I've been
obsessed with yellows for the summer so
this is really nice that pants leg is
really long so that's one thing I don't
like about it because it will drag and
then you'll have like a really really
dirty bottomed pant leg so I don't know
but other than that it looks absolutely
stunning on so I really really like this
alright guys so this basically wraps up
