going to be an unboxing haul for some
products makeup products that I got from
Ikea house.com now I have a whole bunch
of items everything will be linked down
below if you're interested in purchasing
these items now they do have a lot of
their items if you're trying to find
stuff on their website usually always in
stock so this is one thing I like about
this website you're not like frantically
waiting for an item to be in stock they
usually always replenish with items now
I do have lip products eyelashes galore
I do have some eye shadow some brushes
and some powder and stuff like that so
I'm really excited to show you guys
these items that I picked out today so I
am going to hope that you guys like this
video because I'm adding it to the mix
because my channel is kind of a beauty
Channel so it's based on fashion makeup
and hair so it would be just great to
add something like this to my channel so
I hope you guys like it and don't forget
to thumbs up now if you're interested in
seeing what I have to offer in this
video today I would like you to stay
tuned to keep on watching guys okay so
starting off I'm going to show you guys
these brushes that I got from LA Colors
now I'm not really a brush person but I
decided to try these out
so the first brush I got right here is
the blush brush and it's just like your
basic brush guys it's kind of like one
of those fluffy flower brushes and Desa
la colors on it's black and it's simple
I just wanted to get this to add it to
my collection maybe use it for bronzing
or you know use it for bronzing or
wiping away that nice baked underneath
my eyes and round so I picked this one
out now the next item I got was a
blending brush
now the blending brush is from the same
company la Collins and I just got this
one just except sometimes I'll do a
crease and I need a brush to do my
crease sometimes so I got this small
blending brush just for creasing and I'm
trying to blend stuff in whatever and I
was like you know what's cute it's
little and I just felt like you know I
had one before that I lost so I was
trying to get into one anyway so I
picked this when I was like this is
gonna be good for what I need it for now
the same Xing our dot was mascara and
now I have mask I got you know how to
have myself on my scale which is crazy
because I need it but I got this mascara
from LA girls now this mascara is
supposed to be
luscious length supposed to be luscious
length I use eyelashes anyways I wear
eyelashes practically every single day
but well every time I want to make up
over eyelashes I do not if I don't wear
makeup I'm not wearing eyelashes it's
not happening it just doesn't make sense
but this one is called the wispy mascara
and it's supposed to make your lashes
look luscious and lengthy whatever it's
actually thing that I notice about this
is that the bristle the actual brush is
kind of curved so that will be really
good for your under eyes so this is
basically what it looks like guys and I
got it in black obviously and a lot of
this stuff I got from this company are
from LA girls or la color so you guys
will see a lot of products so I haven't
tried this yet I'm hoping that this
works like I said it's a curved brush so
basically can help you out really good
when you're trying to do leg under eye
you know your lower lash line and your
upper lash line so yeah and like I said
if I wear lashes I don't even bother
doing my upper lashes sometimes I'll do
it so that it's all black in cases and
fall off from the foundation I'm from
the eye shadow so the next thing I got
are these two lipsticks now I think
these are the only lipsticks I got
actually and I have so much lipstick
guys crazy and I also want to show you
guys three other products I got from
when I get this one from the mall I
think I got them from Ulta and so forth
so I want to show you those two because
you guys asked me this question all the
time and I just want to let you guys
know exactly what it is so these two
colors right here are a really nice
cause now these are the LA Colors matte
liquid lipstick and I got one and it's
kind of like it's kind of like one of
those reddish-brown colors look a drop
and so the first one I got is kind
of like in this like brownish red color
now I did it when I got this outfit okay
it's probably one of those nice Coco
colors I usually like me a nice Kovach
color so this is what the first one
looks like it looks kind of like a
brownish kind of red color and when you
put on your on your hand this is what it
looks like it's almost kind of like a
brown red I'm not sure I can look like
on my list but my lips China has kind of
like a mix of brown red so I hope
hopefully it comes out looking pretty
decent I think that's cute so now the
next one I got is kind of like a really
matte like really like powdered donut
one and I didn't
I do this powdered donut I was not you
guys not over stuff like this so that's
kind of like a shock for me when I saw
this was we kind of like one of those
news but like I said I wasn't going for
that powdered donut look but this will
looks like maybe I could just put this
into the middle right here but I want to
do like an ombre I probably rarely wear
this into the arms as you go that looks
a mess okay what else so those are the
two colors that I got and the first one
the name of the first one is called
illusion and then this powdered donut
when it's called suede and I don't know
if I'm going to worse way to be honest
with you guys so the next thing I got is
this brow kit now ideally what I use now
for my brows is I use the black of
cosmetics brow pencil thing I that I've
out for that one that makes my
eyebrows so nice like it just it's
everything so if you have not gotten
that black of cosmetics one you better
hop on it I wanted to try this one from
LA Colors it's just a simple brow kit
and this one isn't as in a dark is in
the BK 210 medium I forgot to in
dark but whatever it looks like a small
brow kit like that I don't use the brush
I don't use the tweezers I just use the
powders and what I'll do is use my angle
brush you get these powders to once I
feel like if I put like a cream of paint
on my eyebrows first I'll use this
powder as a cover so it doesn't so it
mattifies it so these are what I use the
powder for and I do that often with my
eyebrows I'll put like a wet wet base on
first and then I use a powder to kind of
make it matte so this is useful for me
because I can use this when I do my
eyebrows now but I am still holding
tight to the black of cosmetics one girl
now the next thing I want to show you
guys is this eyeshadow palette I got now
this is from a company closet city
colors it's in a matte eyeshadow palette
now I'm not really a purple person but I
like the brown shades that are had in it
and some of the purple ones are okay but
I'm not a purple person I rarely do
purple eyeshadows but I wanted to try
this out just because it's matte and
they do have other brown shades that
will be suitable for creases and just
like kind of some under I do not want to
like you know what I mean so this is
what this pad looks like like I said I'm
not really a purple person but I can
appreciate the purple colors that they
have in here I definitely
we love the colors on the bottom part
those are really nice matte brown tone
colors natural tone cards that would
look really good so I have to pick this
one out because I just I was obsessed
when I saw and it's funny because on the
website it looks like a dump is this
big-ass pallet and then you get it and
kind of like dinky like this I thought
that was so funny but I can't wait to
actually use this for looks let me just
watch the chest anyway it looks like
because I don't want to just talk and
then I was watching it doesn't need a
swatch so I'm going to try the brown one
at the bottom and see what it looks like
I'm gonna show up on my black ass on all
kind of shows up let me just watch this
you guys to see how my fingertips so
this is the brown one let's watch one of
the purple one and this is what the
purple one looks like right there so
hopefully you know these I mean they're
I don't I didn't expect these to be like
a huge color payoff but as long as they
can give me the look I'm going for my
eyes and you guys know I rarely wear
eyeshadow I'll do a crease sometime so
this would be my sometime palette when
I'm doing creases so I just thought that
was cool
now the next thing I got is the LA girl
Pro face powder I've seen a lot of
people review miss powder so I wanted to
try it out for me I'm a very oily person
so when I do to liquid foundation I need
a powder all around sometimes I'll just
use my setting powder just like the
Maybelline translucent powder or I'll
use the LA girls translucent powder and
just all-around powder my face but I
wanted to try something closer to my
skin so I got this in the color Coco and
I wanted to see if it worked really well
for me it does say it's long-lasting oil
controlling powder and it's mattifying
for some finish for radiant look so I
definitely like not crazy google Gaga
about this I picked it out just because
I really need something that's going to
not grease me up and that's going to
work let me just do some I'm just test
out to see what it's looking like
opening these things are so confusing
I'm trying to open this up in front of
you guys so that you guys can see me
while I'm actually opening it up instead
of just talking and smoking in talking
alright guys let me open this up so I
could see okay so I was actually pretty
cute soon and it has a nice little
mirror on the back
oh this is cute let's just flash it so
we can see what it looks like so this is
what it looks like this is what Koko
looks like and this is pretty good if
it's a little too dark all you have to
do is mix it with a lighter powder to
get it get the look you want and it is
definitely it's a nice rich material of
product do you see
wanna see oh just kind of dark but
that's fine
I'll find ways to kind of mix it
together whatever but I'll find
ways to mix it together to make it work
but I wanted to try this out just
because I've heard so many good things
about this now the next thing I got are
some lip eyeliners and brow pencils now
I'm going to I was you guys know I love
the whole color eyeliner liquid eyeliner
on the topless I'm a blue fanatic I love
blue like this blue color is so poppin
for the summer even though summer kind
of dwindling right now so I wanted to
try mascara because someone put in a
contour time that they wanted to see you
like a blue mascara look on me so I got
this blue mascara right here and look
how electric this is I might even bring
this to Jamaica with me and do some cut
a couple looks with some like Demi wispy
lashes and just kind of make my lashes
really blue and pretty so I might even
try this out right here when I go to
Jamaica and I think it would be cool so
I got this one and this is from the
company NK makeup so the next two things
I got I got a primer I got I actually
got an eyeshadow primer sometimes I do
my makeup I use concealer primer said
but I decided to get an eyeshadow primer
and this is a prime mistake from let's
see Pro primer stick from la girl so
just your basic primer stick it's like a
really nice nude color and I usually use
this just before I put my makeup on so I
can just make myself look good you know
my nose the dirtiest flux on now but I
got this one guys just like a prime my
eyes before I get that Luke now the next
thing I got is the eyebrow pencil and I
got just a medium brown and it says
brownie wound whoa oh wow brow II wowie
brow pencil and it's in the color medium
brown y'all is embarrassing
so I want to try this out because I'm
trying to try pencils out to to see if
pencils are going to work for me
let me just hi my hand like that because
what the my nails look a mess so I
want to try this out comes with a little
spooley at the end right here and I want
to see how this worked out for my
eyebrows I'm trying different things on
my eyebrows because I just started
making my eyebrows dark a prayer request
from you guys because you guys are
saying my eyebrows are too light so I
just tried to make my eyebrows a little
bit darker for you guys or whatever
whatever okay so the next thing I got
are some concealers imagine a swatches
because you guys already know these
these are the these are the LA Pro
concealers these have been around for
years these are the only ones that I
wear from my under eye I just only use
these now that accidentally gave me two
almond I got almond and let's see
talking I was looking for flan guys they
accidentally gave me two of the almond
almond and toffee and flan they're about
the same color they're like in the same
region I just got this as a light to
give myself that actually bright
highlight underneath my eyes so I'm
looking woke so I picked these up and
you know what these are going up in
price these things are like $2.99 now
they used to be 250 and eight you know
what they used to be a dollar
ninety-nine another there another 250
not their $3 the company we brought
we're buying is so much that this
company thinks that they can do that
like this is crazy you guys were out one
when I first came out there were a
dollar ninety-nine they trippin now the
next thing I want to show you guys is
this little stuff that I got now this
came in a complete set and like I said I
think I feel like a lot of LA Colors la
girls to be honest with you guys so this
is Ellen drops and it's um it's kind of
like a setting powder it's a setting
powder setting spray and primers so I
got this one because I wanted to try
them out I've heard great things about
their setting powder now the setting
powder is like a translucent powder it's
like really really translucent and I
wanted to try it out to some like you
know everybody's been raging about this
product and expenses a sign as the
beautiful beauty supply store and as a
really supply store they be trippin on
they prices sometimes I'm not paying
that much money for so I got the mini
kit so it comes with us as mini HD face
primer which I use sometimes sometimes
these things make me look oily that
oilier than
I am so I try not to use II sometimes I
also got the setting spray the setting
spray is just a regular setting spray
I'm someone that uses a Mac one or the
next Matt one which I like a lot and
that's when I use all the time so this
is what this one looks like it's just a
regular setting spray and this is a part
of that everyone's raving about I'm like
really excited to review this product
everyone's been raving about this one
it's super inexpensive and the thing
about this powder it's like really it's
like translucent translucent and it is
consistent outer but it's like simply
white so it's like a white powder and
some I mean I don't know what to say
about it just gotta try it but don't
worry guys I'm going to post I'm going
to do another makeup tutorial using
these products so you guys will see
everything in full flash once that post
is makeup tutorial off now the next
thing I got and I got just randomly
because I used to use these from ELF a
long time ago so I got the elf smudge
pot in the color why not I used to get
one that was kind of like there was one
that needs to get before that was a
little bit different the only reason why
I like these is because if you're trying
to get like a really bold eyeshadow look
and you want like a color similar to the
eyeshadow this one's more like a wine
color and if I wanted to do like a nice
wine eye I can put this done as the base
and kind of build the powder foundation
on top of it to give myself more of a
glow so this is what it looks like guys
it's a really pretty wine color and
basically what it is it's kind of like
um it's kind of like a gloop that's not
a group you kind of like paste it on
your eye and it creates the eye shadow
look I really like this guy's I used to
have one either that's the other one
that I have but they didn't have it at
this place so I just pick out this one
it's like a cream foundation that I just
think it's really pretty and it's right
here I like it so much so I decided to
pick this up as one I do some cute
little eye looks with it so I was I
 am I get it now the next thing I
got is this blush now blush has been
kind of like going down like a lot of
people don't wear blush like that
anymore but for me I'm going away so I
wanted to do like a really nice blush so
I got this blush from LA girls it says
just blushing now the comment I got is
just for fun and it is like an orange e
coral blush I absolutely love this
especially when you're like on a night
oh my god like
beautiful on cocoa skin like you cannot
tell me that this is not going to be
this is not hitting it like this is how
do L mission like this is so nice guy so
I wanted to try this one out
they had other colors and I didn't want
to get the basic pink colors with like
paints you can always get pink anywhere
so I want to try this one out and I look
at guys oh my gosh look at how you can
even use this as an eyeshadow to beyond
you can even use it as eyeshadow look at
how beautiful this is like that is so
freaking nice like and I'm like oh my
god that's going to look so great on my
skin like it's going to look so pretty
you definitely use this as a crease
powder for your eyes you want to that
orange treat not for damn I'm probably
just going to use this as a blush
because I think it's really really
pretty like look how nice this is
okay so the next thing I got before eyes
don't dive into the lashes because I got
a lot of lashes I saw this right here
and I was a little bit like them this is
different so basically what this is it's
kind of like a blending brush but it's a
blending brush for your finger so you
basically put your finger in this and
you basically apply your makeup your
concealer with it on your fingers now
they had some weird reviews on it's like
people some people do like and some
people like this I was like you know
what let me try it out for myself to see
if I like it so basically you'll put the
concealer down you know just the tapping
your hand on it so I think that this is
actually pretty cool instead of holding
the actual Beauty Blender sometimes I
should fall and it's I guess in a way so
this would be quite a cool to kind of
powder to add this your concealer on
with this I decided to pick this up I
have not used it yet so I will tell you
guys what it's like or when I do the
makeup tutorials will see how I use it
on my face now the last few things that
up so that's a small scare so the last
few things I got are some lashes now you
guys know I love lashes lashes on line
the first I want to show you guys on the
inv a super strong hold eyelash adhesive
I use hair glue and I know people said
don't use hair boots not good you can
blind yourself it's not good for your
health whatever but let me tell you
something here
was the best thing that works like that
thing lose your eyelashes down you want
to have this thing coming off at all
so I wanted to try this one you know try
to be good about it you know so I picked
up the super hos black one it says it's
black which is I need a black I hate
that white calf so I got this one for my
NV and it should be good so I'm hoping
that this one works out pretty good I
hope that this is legit okay so as far
as the last we've had to come up close
I'll show you guys so the first flash
that I got and some of them are
duplicates so just think about it so the
first thing I got is a wispy ones from
ardell and these what I saw might notice
a look like this these are really cute
guys but these are wispy lashes and let
me show you guys with these earthlings
these are one of my favorite style
lashes on these are these are it like
sometimes I like volume so what I'll do
is add on individuals at the top of the
rim just to kind of make it look more
thicker but these lashes are pretty
pretty legit guys now the next one I got
from absolutely New York now these are
human hair lashes - absolute New York if
you're from the city or you've been in
the city some of the hair stores in the
city saw this brand and I think some of
the city some of the hair stores in
Connecticut do too but mostly in the
cities where I've seen this brand now I
just positive the name is absolute New
York doorway so this is what I this is
the one I got now this is very simple it
does you can build up the look with this
one by adding mascara on it so I usually
buy these because I can build up the
volume with mascara so I buy them a
little bit like sparse and they kind of
filled it in with mascara but I thought
that these were good I said now the next
ones that I got that I absolutely love
are these 50 lashes and I got two of
them the same thing just because I was
like damn actually when I saw it I knew
it's going to be this nice also let me
get to just to make sure that you know
if I do like to put if I do like them
that I have a second pair so these are
called gypsy lashes in their human hair
lashes as well now these are kind of
like whispies but kind of like a cool
scary spider wispy and I just love it
these are the ones when you build up
mascara on these that they really really
evolved and I like this one so much so
I've got two packs of this one just in
case like and I I knew I was going to
like it so I'm happy that I got
like these are legit now the next thing
I got are the Angel Isis I got two of
the same number 106 now adopting just
because I wanted to like I said build
off of mascara just wear them if I'm
trying to wear like a light beat I just
like this one a lot and these are what
they look like these are the number 106
they're very simple I got two pairs just
because I like when I find something I
like I like to keep it going now the
next one's I got a cherry blossoms now
these are the whiskers from cherry
blossom and these whiskies are these are
pop and - I love wispy lashes there's
some wispy lashes that they have now
that are really lengthy so these right
here are perfect and these are the
lengthy ones so they go to Train blossom
ones and wispy and these right here are
too legit to quit like come on guys look
at that and these are the ones you use
masks and you build on so I just love
this now the next set the next box is I
got I got these ones aren't called
amazing shine professional quality eye
lashes the style number on this one is
311 T now this one very small but these
have a distinct iconic wispy but was
like a dark wispy kind of weirdness I
like like I said when you're trying to
do makeup and it's not going to like a
heavy look it's just going to be eyes
and lips and like contour and stuff like
that these are the lashes that I like to
use because they kind of draw emphasis
towards your eyes so this is what this
one looks like they're kind of chunky
wispy in a way it's kind of weird you
got if you know if you're like a last
person you know exactly I'm telling all
these are like a chunky wisp and I just
love these guys these are so so pretty
so so so so so pretty now the next thing
I got the next lashes I got are the
while I keep getting whispies I'm
tripping so I got another pair of
whiskey's now these are from J lash and
these are obviously human hair these are
another set of whiskey's but these
whiskey's are not like other whispies
these are a bit these are a bit like
lighter with feet but again with these
our whiskey's so these are the whiskey's
that they have and I just
guys I love these wispy so much they
look so nice so I also got the LA Colors
dream lashes and I got the ones in the
style dolly
now the dolly is number
973 and I really like these two guys
these are not wispies but these are kind
of like drama lashes that are kind of
thin but you just like I said before you
build up on these lashes with mascara
these as a matter of fact I think these
were a dollar I actually went to when I
was in Brooklyn one day well I'm in
Brooklyn
every day every like every single week
every practically every day I was saying
here at Dallas run these oneself at
dollar store I almost sort of kind of
logic reaction to me because my eyes are
reacting funny but they weren't but
these are really nice guys
inexpensive AF and they do the job I
just think that these are cute and
because it's on a Clinton how can you
not buy them like Hello like come on
right come on
so the last lash that I have is the car
lashes in number 43 and actually have
these lashes on right now now these
lashes that I have on up the car is kind
of a mix to mix up whiskey's with like
regular lengths now if you see mines
mines I've built
I build mines is mascara that's just my
nails are still shiny so with mine said
build month with mascara mascara but
they are actually pretty thick in the
beginning we first get them so these are
what the other cookin these are the
number 43 these are one of my favorites
as well too I usually wear these when
I'm trying to do like a small drama look
if I'm trying to go out I use these and
put mask on it to give myself a little
bit more are asked or whatever you want
to card it these are not part of I can't
house but since I you know it's a sin
I'm doing a makeup kind of show off like
a Show and Tell whenever I decide to add
ease into so now I just got this one
this one of these I haven't tried yet so
I'm going to try it on my next video my
makeup tutorial so you can see so my
favorite lipsticks that I wear when
they're all is Heather this is ma vie
pouty lip and I use the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills Veronica now this is what
it looks like in the bottle I'm gonna
swatch it on my arm so you guys can see
what it looks like this is one my
favorite liquid lipsticks it's the one
series in it it's the one right here now
it's a very nice mauve color a
definitely complements african-american
skin I just always wear this lip color I
also in combination with the Veronica
Anastacio I also use the Lolita from Kat
Von D this one is comparable
that one as well to it they just look so
similar and they just give you this
amazing like matte kind of pouty lip now
this is that one and they're kind of
similar in color I definitely go for
these two like all the time and my
videos if you guys notice it's just it's
just my lip color just what I like when
I'm used to now I actually actually
bought another one I bought the crucifix
which is the brown color too now
crucifix I've never tried this before
this the first time out of opening it
Wow and the first time I just broke the
seal so this is the first time I'm
actually opening this one and it's
supposed to be like a nice brown color
and I love my Brown sometimes it's a
Lolita in the anastacio I use a brown to
kind of really get the nice lobby tone
mixed in so I do that a lot with those
so that's probably my pairing with those
colors right there so this is crucifix
right here and it's a nice brown color
so I only showed you guys these because
you guys asking all the time about my
lip so I wanted to show you guys the
products that I use on my lips on a
daily daily basis and there's seemingly
these two right here
and I probably add this as a pairing
with these combinations right here so
