slash dick girl Tron haul video so
today's video guys is sponsored by Rose
gal comm so all our items will be listed
down below for you guys if you guys are
interested in purchasing anything from
this website so today's video is gonna
be kind of a mix so I'm gonna show you
guys some clothes obviously but I'm also
going to show you guys some nice gifting
items that you guys can get for your
family and friends for the holidays
now the items that I'm gonna show you
guys are kind of like a mix of accessory
items electronics etc etc so if you do
have people in your family that are kind
of difficult to buy gifts for this
website has a wide variety of things
that probably would work for your
friends or family so guys if you're
interested in seeing what I have to
offer in today's try on haul I would
like you to stay tuned and keep on
watching alright guys so we're gonna
start off with the clothing items
obviously because that's mainly what I
do so the first thing I'm gonna show you
guys is this really cute dress that I
picked out now when I first saw the
dress on the website I kind of look like
one of those fashioned over dresses that
button all the way up with those little
tiny buttons but this one was a little
bit different I got it it had bigger
buttons and it wasn't so exposed like
the fashion over one which is good so
this one I believe I put this one on to
size extra large or 2x with this website
I sized up up because it is a Chinese
based website our Asian based website
I'll call it and you never know what
you're gonna get when you get the
clothes so I didn't want to take any
chances I believe this is a size extra
large but I'll link it down below
exactly what size I got so it's a really
nice black dress and it has like these
white buttons going all the way down it
does have an opening at the bottom that
is not it's like an opening where it's
not gonna like peel open because the
buttons are actually not real buttons
towards the bottom so the bottom of the
dress the buttons are actually not real
so therefore none of this part on the
bottom here where the seam stops will
open the only parts that are open are at
the breast upper breast area which I
thought was excellent it does come with
a little belt too tight against your
waist and I think that is just
definitely accentuates the curl so I
like it a lot it definitely look good
with some like over the knee heel boots
or something very simple it is a long
sleeve dress so therefore you're not
gonna be too cold put a jacket over and
you're looking like a bad one so I
thought that this dress is really cute
and it's actually one of my favorites
from this
our clothing situation now the next
thing I got is this really cute top it's
very simple guys but I like it because
it's gray and it just looks really nice
and kind of like fall/winter and she's
inspired so this one I got him in size
extra large and I loved it so much guys
it has like this nice kind of ruffles
design and it has a cold-shoulder
exposure area which I thought was really
cute and it fits very nice it's
comfortable it's a soft material it's
like a nice cotton material which I
thought was really nice it does have the
cold shoulder sleeves and on the culture
their sleeves it does have the ruffle
design as well - along with the kind of
collar of the neck and the back as well
- so I thought it was really nice
very simple top and it was a size extra
large fits very nice and it's definitely
a shirt that you can add to get the
items piece together looks and it just
will look fabulous so I really really
like this one now the next thing I got
I'm really a platypus and I got my plaid
shirt on right now I love plaid plaid is
just like definitely like a fall
essential once your essential it's just
everything for me so I picked this one
out and I see this on a few other
websites but I've never been bold enough
to pick it I think the only reason why I
picked this one out from this website is
because they sized up all the way until
2x or 3x and because it sized up so far
like that I took a chance of the mic
it's gonna fit so I got this one during
a 2x and it's like this nice green
checkered shirt it does have the great
insides with the grey strings it's
really really soft guys it's very very
nice it is definitely one of those
pieces that can be a layering piece so I
could wear like my leather jacket over
this or my jean jacket like that a line
any like a longline bomber jacket or
whatever with this it's very soft very
nice and it's kind of one of those
pieces that you could dress up or dress
down so I thought it was really cute
when I start on the website so I picked
it up now it is a 2x and it fits nice
it's comfortable definitely gives you a
lot of wiggle room and you can
definitely put like things on top of it
and actually put a shirt underneath it
if you just want to wear this out put
like a nice thick long sleeve shirt
underneath it and you'll be looking like
ready to go all right moving along guys
so the next three items I'm gonna show
you guys are kind of long sleeve style
shirts as well too so the first thing I
guys it's a really nice kind of like
sweater dress thing now this was
supposed to be a sweater dress but when
I put it on
was nowhere near sweater dress so I
decided to wear this with leggings and
boots just period or sneakers because
there is no way on God's green earth I'm
gonna get away with walking outside with
this type of ensemble but it was cute
with leggings I would not recommend if
you're curvy to wear this by itself
because it's just not gonna work so I
take this sweater it's supposed to be a
sweater dress it has a pocket opening in
the front right here it does have kind
of like a pattern design or like a criss
like one of those weird crisscross
patterns in the front it does have like
a really high collar neck part which
makes it kind of look more edgy and more
like athletic vibey so I thought that
was cute it is very soft guys it is
definitely one of those sweater
materials so it's really soft very nice
I do like this one a lot and I sighs I
got this one two three acts and when I
got it 3x I assume that the 3x is gonna
be like super super big so therefore if
it was capable of being addressed I
thought it would be capable of being
addressed but the 3x is just like a
regular sized large shirt or size extra
large shirt so don't get carried away
it's not gonna be like a long sweat
sweat sweat shirt dress which I thought
it was but honestly it is really
fashionable it looks really like kind of
like a retro or a tee not not 80s and
it's not kind of like a futuristic type
of hoodie or whatever and it just I
don't I like it you guys will see when I
wear it like with the long hair just
look like really cool so I liked it a
lot so like I said 3x is the highest
size it goes up to I imagine if you went
up to 6 X what it would look like but I
do think it's nice it's very soft very
comfortable material guys so you're not
gonna be like really tight in it or
anything like that it fits good so if
you're my size I recommend getting the
3x I don't think they had a 4x so 3x
would be the one to go for when you pick
this one up but I really thought that
this was cute guys and I liked it a lot
now the next thing I got was this really
cute grey shirt now this is very simple
and I like grey shirts or shirts in
general that have kind of like that
high-low part and they kind of like the
slit that comes up right above right
where the like kind of like almost at
your highest waist boy I love that the
shirts that have those little splits
because if you are curvier or if you
want to give yourself a curve beat when
the shirt kind of opens up on the sides
that kind of formulates kind
like a curve look and I just I'm
obsessed with shirts like that so when I
saw this one on the website I was like
you know what dum let's get this it's
really cute so I got this one in an
extra-large and it's kind of like cold
shoulder as well too but this one is
kind of strappy so it has like two
straps on the top and it's kind of it
was a little confusing in the beginning
on the website it was cool so I kind of
has like two extra straps on each side
on the top here so the only thing about
that is kind of weird if you wear a bra
because it's gonna be like three a
triple strap look and if your bra is not
gray like this heather gray it's gonna
be like kind of leg I know I'm kind of
worried about stuff like that but it'll
look kind of funny so I recommend
wearing just kind of like a two bra a
tube top bra or something else instead
of wearing a bra with it just because
it's gonna look too much but I do like
this a lot guys and I'm talking but this
is what I'm talking about the split it
has a nice slip right here and it kind
of opens up and it's like a high-low
design so the front is shorter in the
back is long it's a very soft material
guys it looks really really good on and
this is also one of those types of
pieces you could wear any type of
bottoms with it and you can just go
about your business and look fabulous at
the same time so I thought that this was
really cute very simple and very
inexpensive so you cannot go wrong with
this one now the next thing that I got
is a sweater it's kind of Manila color
I'm not gonna put it up to the screen
cuz it'll wash me out so it's kind of
like an off-white or Manila color that's
what I call it that's the right thing to
say but it's really cute guys as a size
extra large what really drew me to this
one was because it had like this
crisscross pattern going down kind of
like at the waistline and I thought it
was really cute so a definite kind of
scopes you ought to live in kind of
accentuate your curves this is a type of
sweater I like to wear with I kind of
like khaki over the knee heeled boots or
boots period it just has like this kind
of like nice Christmasy holiday vibe to
it the sweater it is a knit sweater and
it is a real knit sweater it's not a
fake one and if it's really soft guys
the colors really pretty as well too and
I just think all together with the
design and the sweater suffocate they
came through
excellent with this one it looks
fabulous it's definitely something you
could wear with any type of bottoms like
jeans leggings or whatever bottoms you
have I'm not gonna say whatever bottoms
cuz I don't think it will look humid a
skirt just because it comes down pretty
long
I would say with bottoms meaning pant
bottoms or what everything like that
leggings jeans etc etc I just think that
these will look really good with that
and I don't know I like this a lot
enough I felt like I vibe really hard
with the sweater guys I love it it's so
cute guys and I believe that other
colors don't quote me on that but just
check the link down below to make sure
if they do have other colors I would
give you the thumbs up because I'm sure
the other cows will come through just as
well as this color went through guys
honest so the next two or three items
I'm going to show you guys two of them
are kind of similar because they're gene
material you guys know I've been
obsessed is kind of like jeans shirts
jean jackets all that kind of stuff just
because it's really trending now and it
just looks so good in the fall in the
winter kind of like layering jean
jackets and jean shirts and stuff like
that with different patterns different
textures and stuff like that so I've
really been into that kind of stuff
lately so the first check about it guy I
actually wore this on this shirt because
it's not so thick and it actually looks
really good if you wear it like as a
shirt so I didn't wear anything
underneath I just watered shirt so this
whole floral floral pattern thing has
been popular too so this one this jean
jacket is kind of like a distressed
jacquard distressed jean shirt and it
came with this floral design which I
really like so that's why I picked it
out now the floor design they only kind
of glued it like towards the middle part
just to stick it on so if you want to go
in with some glue gun some gangulu then
whatever you can go and in put some of
that glue on here to kind of stick these
down but I really don't care it just
kind of gives it like a 3d effect I
guess but I thought that this was really
cute guys now I picked this one on a
size extra large so I definitely took a
large risk with this one it is to stress
on the bottom guys it's really cute it's
a very soft materials almost kind of
like one of those like kind of like gia
cheap Jean materials but I wasn't really
looking at that I looked at the design
in the shape and the way they cut the
design out which is why I liked it a lot
so you guys will see when I pull the
clothes up it just looks really cute and
really fun it also looks kind of vintage
so it kind of looks like a 90s inspired
jacket or jacket that someone got and
they kind of customized if I add in the
floral print on it so it kinda has that
kind of like old-school vibe to it
which I really like so definitely check
this out I thought that this was
actually really cute and
nice it has an oversized feel and you
can just really style up or style it
down now the next one I got is also kind
of like a it looks like it was a vintage
jacket that people that I guess rolls
out took and they kind of styled it up
so when I saw it I was like to myself oh
this is cute as well too
so this is dark blue guys and it I'm not
going to hold it up because it's gonna
kind of block my light out I'm trying to
be pretty well whatever you know what I
mean so I'm gonna show you guys when it
comes up on the screen so this is really
cute guys it's just stressed all the way
around one thing that I liked about this
one is that I had the word lucky on the
back of it and I just thought that that
was cute like I said this these jean
jackets look like it's kind of like a
vintage jacket or like a lower-end
jacket that was in poppin they went in
and added their custom details to it and
have the jacket looking poppin now so I
I didn't mind that at all it's just less
time for me to go in and put the work
and to do this but I could just buy and
they did it themselves so I liked it
they frayed it up on some certain spots
I like this one a lot because this one
is really really long so it's definitely
one of those items that I consider a
layering piece as well too you can put
this over like the most basic basic
under like piece like a long-sleeve
shirt and some leggings or long-sleeve
shirt some ripped jeans well not ripped
jeans ripped black jeans that will be Q
rip black jeans turtleneck black
turtleneck tucked into the pants and
then put this over it with some nice
shiny boots or cute boots yeah you see
what I'm saying like little things like
that so this is kind of one of those
pieces are like an add-on piece or you
kind of use this to kind of emphasize
your looks instead of trying to go all
crazy thinking about sell because I feel
like sometimes I Drive myself insane
trying to find outfits to wear and then
most of the times I don't even wear
outfit Atticus on most of times I my
work or my home start where the same
things anyways but when it comes to like
actually finding an outfit I Drive
myself insane trying to find the perfect
look guys so this is one of those types
of things so you can wear the most basic
under part and then put this on top and
you're looking like fab city so I
thought that this was cute guys and it's
definitely workable on the pride for the
price it wasn't bad at all honestly now
the next one I got it's kind of actually
not this is actually a shirt guys it's
not a jean jacket or anything like
so it's a white I'm kind of like a
crossover shirt so basically with this
shirt guys it's a long-sleeve shirt it
has like a little pocket in the front so
it's kind of like look I like a hoodie
material but a t-shirt size style so the
cool thing about this one that I like on
the website is that the back was out and
it has like a little bit of a string in
the back that you tie up to give
yourself kind of like a little bit of
skin exposure in the back I like this
one a lot guys just because it was nice
and simple I picked this one on a size 2
XL because I wanted to be comfortable in
it and I was crossing my fingers that it
was fit so it fits perfect and I really
like it I'm super pleased with this one
guys I like this one a lot and it's very
soft it's not a polyester material it's
like a cotton material and it works very
well so guys I will link this down below
and definitely check this one out it's
very soft and simple guys and I think
it's something that you guys would like
really enjoy wearing it's really nice
and kind of like light so the last two
items guys were definitely a fail for me
I just did not like them but maybe
somebody out here will like them so you
guys let me know my sister kinda was
like mmm so I'm gonna show you guys the
jeans that I got first now these jeans
when I first saw them they were really
really wide in the waist and I already
knew straight off the bat that they were
gonna be too big on the waist area I
have very big thighs so my thighs will
always fit into jeans like this just
because my thighs are huge
so now when I put them on guys the
material for me is just a no bueno like
I just don't like it like them the
material has like this really weird
material that like if you sweat just
though like just a little bit of sweat
touching between your thighs the jeans
are just gonna suck the sweat up and
it's just gonna feel disgusting so I
just did not like that at all and if you
guys know what I'm talking about leave
your comment down below
I just can't vibe with stuff like that
just because it just like even if it's
the wintertime like you know when you're
like you got like layers on and you're
like out or whatever and you're sweating
you just don't want to be sticking to
clothes like this so these pants were me
just did not work for me
the waist was way too big number one and
it just the proportionate the
proportions of the jeans from leg to
waist was kind of like what were you
doing dude so I just don't like it like
I'll probably give it off to mice one of
my family members that
it really doesn't care about that kind
of stuff that just kind of wears loose
waste stuff anyways and just likes to be
really loose like my mom is really
skinny on the bottom so she'll probably
like oh I'll take them cuz my mom cares
she don't care you know there's you
don't care like that but for me they are
a new now the second thing that I got
that wasn't know guys is this jacket now
when I saw it on the website was like
okay like I have like a lot of those
kind of a guy I feel like I had pieces
that kind of went with this one when I
try this on guys I would say nah bro
no so it has a cute concept and I'm
trying to figure out what kind of
concept this is because number one it
doesn't have buttons on it so I I feel
like if I keep it I'm gonna have to go
get buttons put into it so it's kind of
like Dom what are you gonna do with this
one so this one is kind of it's a Manila
it's like a Manila it's kind of like an
off-white jacket and it's gonna wash me
out you guys will see it when I put it
up so the thing that it kind of has like
this kind of like a stag vibe or kind of
like a Native American vibe situation
and I kind of like Native American vibe
patterns and prints and stuff like that
they have these amazing shoes for our
brand called Minnetonka's and I always
get those I usually get the flat ones
with the kind of like the aztec design
on the front or I'll get like the of the
flat plain kind of tan color one so I'll
get the long boots one with the three
layers and I was mentioned this in my
videos to you guys I don't know if I
said the Connecticut thing if it's like
an East Coast thing like a like a Upper
East Coast thing to wear Minnetonka's
but like that's like something that we
were in Connecticut I freaking love
Minnetonka so I like the boots I like
the flats like they're just so poppin so
this kind of gave me a vibe of
Minnetonka boots like I have those types
of shoes so I was like oh this will be
cute or so three layer Minnetonka boot
some leggings and maybe like a sweater
underneath but when I put the the jacket
I almost like this is so unstructured
like this is it's like there's a lot
going on so I think that's why I was a
little fearful about this one just
because there's a lot going on and I
can't see myself honestly wearing this
with all this stuff going on so I'm
gonna try to figure something out like
if I get one stare and it's kind of like
an awkward stare I'm gonna be like I
should have just you know gave it away
to someone or whatever so I'm gonna give
this a chance but straight off the bat
this is a know for me like I would not
comment' if you're not someone that can
like pull stuff off like this which I
know of you know I'm saying so if you're
not something I can pull stuff off like
this obviously I would say kind of be
where I'm choosing this item in
particular on the website just because
it's kind of weird it's just there's a
lot going on and you can even see the
sleeve right here there's a lot going on
it's just it's at the collar it's just
there's a lot going on it even when you
get to the bottom trim it's still
pattern like this with a little frayed
there's a lot going on with this one
guys so I would say if you're not
someone that's kind of like like fashion
savvy or anything like that or someone
that can't piece this one together or
kind of formulate an idea in your head
just kind of not choose this item so I'm
gonna see what I can do but you guys
will see you guys will see it just was a
little scary in the beginning honest
alright guys so I'm gonna show you guys
some shoes that I got from Rosedale
so the first shoes I'm gonna show you
guys are one of my favorites guys and
I've worn them once already so there's
this like kind of patent leather kind of
booties now it's kind of funny because
it has like a sock material at the top
right here but they are super cute and
obviously I've Carice these babies up
already if you know how to avoid
creasing your shoes let me know guys
they do have like a stud design on top
of the actual leather the sole part on
the bottom they're very cute they're
very comfortable they are a size forty
UK forty which is it converts into a US
size nine I really think these are cute
they're definitely very fashionable guys
and when I wore them I got so many
compliments they look so cute and the
way that they fit right here is because
it's kind of like a sock material it
kind of really cinches in at your ankle
which kind of gives you more like a
refined clean look so I thought that
these were cute AF and they're
definitely kind of like nice and trendy
for the fall so I would recommend
choosing these off the website they look
really really good guys thumb now I'm
just joking but I thought that these
were cute so the next ones that I got
are these kind of like slip-on shoes now
I love stuff like this just because
they're really comfortable so these as
well are sized for a UK 40 u.s. nine so
they're basically kind of like these
nice kind of slip-on shoes or whatever
they do have a nice durable sole on the
bottom so
you can definitely wear these outside I
usually kind of use these as house
slippers just to wear or if I'm just
taking like a quick run to Walmart or
just like a quick run somewhere I'll
wear these they're very comfortable they
do have like a little time in front of
fake tie in the front so that's really
useful they don't kind of like make it
tight but there's just four accessory
wise it does have a fur inside so you
get like fur on the edges right here and
fur in the inside part which makes it
more comfortable to wear I think the big
bet these are really cute and they
definitely cute with like plaid shirts
guys and stuff like that so if you're
looking for stuff like this I recommend
these will actually be good as a gift as
well too because like my sister loves
wearing slippers so she might kind of
like these type of soft furry items so
this will look good and be good for
someone who likes this on the holidays
as well as a Christmas gift and these
were like really cheap so you definitely
cannot go wrong with these now the next
pair of shoes that I got are these
really cute red sneakers
now the leisa it didn't come laced up
and I'm even bothered to lace it up
because this is the first time that I'm
showing you guys that I just opened the
box for these so I'm really seeing it
for the first time so this makes it kind
of like fashionable red sneakers right
here
I love colored sneakers like I have like
so many colored full colored sneakers
it's ridiculous now I do have a pair of
all red vans but I wanted something that
kind of looked more sporty more kind of
like fashionable so this is funny
because the side of the shoe says actual
fashion on it which I kind of was like
damn that's tacky I have why can't it
just leave that alone and not even put
that on there they have to put that in
there make it look real tacky but if you
were kind of like sweatpants or whatever
nobody's gonna see that anyway so I was
like you know what nobody's gonna see
that so I dressed come with the red
shoelaces as well too so he just
shoelace them up these are the type of
shoes I wouldn't wear to be
matchy-matchy I would actually wear
these with all black and then this will
be the pop of color and wear it like
with like a red lip or something like
that just because I like these so much
they're very soft the bottom of this is
really sturdy as well too and it's funny
because it says boost on the bottom and
that's supposed to be kind of like what
is this shoe called the Yeezys it's
supposed to be like the easiest title
the boost we noticed I know is just like
the little knockoff Easy's but these are
cute guys and I thought that they were
cheap anyway so I was like you know what
I'm gonna get these as well too so these
are definite kind like a nice sporty
style sneaker
their people are so crazy about name
brands and stuff like that yo you could
buy none if you go buy a knockoff Louie
Vuitton bag you can buy a knockoff pair
of Yeezys and you know your girl will do
that in a heartbeat so these are def PQ
and if someone is as appreciative and
they don't care about brand stuff
they'll be so happy to get a pair of
shoes like this cuz I know I would
alright guys so the next thing I got is
this really cute hat now this hat says I
hate school now my friend is actually
getting her master's right now in social
work so she's like doing this
accelerated nine-month program and she's
always telling me oh my god I hate
school I hate it this is it for me I
can't wait till this is over I'm never
going back to school and I love her so
much so I was like to myself
we actually saw this together on the
website because we're like streaming
through when I was looking for items and
she's oh my god a hat so cool so I ended
up getting this hat for her and I'm
gonna give it to her for Christmas her
birthday's actually the 23rd of December
my to the 27th so we're kind of like
right moshpit in between December
Christmas itself so I'm gonna give this
to her on Christmas she's probably not
gonna watch this much of the video
because she ain't got time cuz he's
studying to watch a 20 minute video so
I'll probably give this I'm not probably
I am gonna give this away to her or give
it to her for Christmas because she is
that advocate the poster child for
saying this like I hate school I hate
school so this is for Alex and she's my
bestie now the next thing I got is this
really cute little thing and I picked
this up random because I was like you
know what let me just look at what they
have for like decor because they do have
a decor selection or section the course
selection to course section same thing
they have like this decor section on
their page so I saw this sort of cute
thing and it was kind of like a boy and
girl
it had so funny it says toilet on it so
I picked this one on I was like it's
like one of those little sticky things
you stick on your bathroom door whatever
so I was like you know what that let's
just get this is like $2 so I picked
this one I was to put on my bathroom now
the next thing I got are some earrings
earrings now these earrings on there I
look at them I don't know how they're
going to work I think that these
earrings were supposed to be kind of
like little clips for you like clip ones
for like your hoop like your your hoop
up here like to clip them on so I'm
going to try to find a way to
incorporate these with my look
now that I looked at look at him now I'm
kind of like why did I get this cuz I
don't I honestly don't think like this
is gonna work so I probably give this to
my sister or something she probably
could incorporate this into her looks or
whatever because I don't even know where
I got that to be honest with you now the
next thing I got is this really cute
book bag now you guys know I'm obsessed
with kind of like book bags purses and
stuff like that but not like handbags
I like side satchels or side bags buddy
bags so I found this cute little book
bag and I liked it because of the print
that I had on top of it this print is
really really nice and intricate guys
and I thought it was so so cute now I
don't know exactly what it is I'm
probably gonna have to examine it extra
hard to figure out exactly what it is
but just straight off the bat you guys
see how beautiful and lovely this is now
this one I got for myself because I just
needed something else now this is
different because it can be a book bad
guys so you can wear like a book bag or
you can actually take it and wear it
let's see you can actually open it up
like this and turn it into like an
actual pocket bag so you can actually
wear it like a bag like this or you
could wear it as a book bag which I
thought was really cute and all you have
to do is zip it up and you're good to go
so this is really nice it's roomy I
don't really care a lot of stuff with me
anyways to begin with I'll probably put
my charger in here my cell phone and my
wallet but I usually don't carry a
wallet so I'm like really simple I don't
like stuff like that so I thought that
this was cute especially traveling I'm
going to Thailand in March so I thought
it'd be good to take with me to Thailand
something to travel around thailand with
so I thought that's was great so I
picked this one out and I love the
pattern I love like it's just something
about it's just so cool it has pocket on
sample little water bottle here
everything about it was cool to me so I
picked this one out now the last two
items guys I saw on the website now it's
kind of like when I saw it I was like
wait this is a joke right there's no way
they have these items here so the first
thing that I picked out with this blood
pressure monitoring cuff and it also
picked out a pulse oximeter fingertip
thing as well so if you've ever been to
the hospital before they use something
called nurse on wheels so nurse on wheel
basically is like your portable blood
pressure cuff your temperature
thermometer and all that kind of stuff
so it basically does your vitals so
that's why we call
nurse on wheels so I got this one just
in case like I work Hospice and
sometimes I have to go do or I work
Hospice and I do home care so most of
the times I'll have to go to people's
house to do visits and stuff like that
so I was like you know what let me just
pick some items up from this website I'm
not quite sure these items are gonna be
as accurate as doing like a regular
blood pressure I'm so used to doing
regular blood pressures with my regular
set to stuff my regular cuff but I
wanted to try this off because I was
like you know what this one might work
so it's basically one of your electronic
blood pressure cuffs and this one is
actually one of the risk ones so you
basically put it on the risk and you
would let it sit and it will actually
calibrate your blood pressure you can do
it on the wrist or you can actually come
up a little bit higher I believe I've
never really used one of these before
like I said because I do manual blood
pressures we're actually have to inflate
the cuff and listen so that's how I
usually do my blood pressures but when
you're working like home care hospices
stuff like that emergency situations
usually at a hospital setting they
actually you know we actually just used
a nurse on wheels a nurse on wheel just
to get the job done faster because in
moments like that you have to be on your
feet and you have to go but I thought
this would be cute to bring around in my
my traveling bag or have in my car in my
nurse bag just in case of there's an
emergency if something happens at night
it'd be their stack I have my stuff with
me and I can get the job done so I
thought that was really good just to let
you guys know you guys definitely
batteries for those so that's one thing
I didn't realize till after I got the
item that any batteries right so the
next one is this pulse ox machine so
basically this one actually reads your
pulse ox and your I believe your your
pulse is Ray as well so basically you
just clip your finger on it like this
and you let it sit for a few minutes and
it'll give you the pulse ox number which
is if you're healthy breathing young
whatever not even young it probably a
hundred percent anyways and it'll show
you your heart rate on here two numbers
will come up and you'll kind of see how
it looks I thought this was cute too as
well and it was something that I could
utilize like I said you don't have to be
a nurse you can know someone who's going
to nursing school someone who is a nurse
and this can be an awesome gift these
two items were cheap AF on the website
guys and most of the time you can get a
kit
Amazon which is priced the same so I
kind of was like to myself it must be
good it must be right so I picked them
out so even if you know someone that's
just graduated nursing school someone
that's going to nursing school or
someone that is in the field medical
assistant whatever it is
they can utilize these as one I thought
these were great items to pick out guys
they were inexpensive and if you're
someone that needs to be stat on
something or if you're someone that does
traveling nursing etc etc these items
would be great so I definitely pick
these alright guys so three other items
that I selected from this website as
well or unit so I selected three
synthetic wigs so I'm gonna kind of go
an order or try to at least go in order
to show you guys what the wigs look like
so the first unit that they sent me was
this kind of like Bob styled angled bob
styled unit that I actually selected
myself now this one is supposed to be
like one of those wavy curly kind of
classical Bob's now I was a little iffy
about it when I received it just because
the parting space looks like that so I'm
not even gonna attempt to do anything as
far as styling this I'm simply gonna put
it on my head and slap a hat on so you
guys will see that it just looks a funny
AF but I do like the curl pattern and
stuff like that so I have like a fedora
hat or like a baseball cap you just
change it into like one of those bad
hair day type of units and that's all
that thumbs gonna do because this is
clearly not something that I can really
wear out confidently just because the
parting space is trash but if you bought
it by mistake and you ended up getting
it it's like crack like this you're just
making one of your wig hats which I have
a few Weeke hats so not shabby not bad
now the next unit I got is like this
really nice curly style unit now this
one is like a lace front to unit it is
synthetic still guy so don't get that
twisted but it definitely has like the
lace like it would be on like a lace
front wig so you do get like a little
bit of lace in the front part right here
you get three combs at the top one cone
oh no comb in the back just and
adjustable strip yeah just an adjustable
strap in the back and three combs at the
top so it's pretty nice it's a nice
curly texture this one I may say maybe
one of those little nice curly synthetic
wigs
this what I actually would wear like a
flip over method style this one knob
it's not too bad as far as putting got
to be glue on the baby here is probably
not just because I don't I've never
worked with I don't know I have where we
got to Boogaloo hair and we got to be
good with synthetic hair I don't know
for this one I just feel like I should
just wear it the way it is and just kind
of style crazy just cuz it's like really
has like this it's not like your typical
synthetic hair it's really really
plasticky and I just don't want to
tamper with it too much to kind of mess
it up so I think that I like the curl so
this won't be a wig I just wear like a
flip over method with and if guys if I
choose to put some baby hair magic on it
I will do so but I don't know man I
don't know but this is cute as well to
you guys and I'm not I don't remember
the exact price on this baby right here
but it's super super soft guys like it's
really really soft so this one right
here might just be one of them might be
might be a winner right here so I don't
know I like this one though this is a
last thing that the other sent me guys
and I'm just a little bit like weary
about this one this one is definitely
really synthetic II and because they did
do kind of like a curl pattern at the
end and just tangles like a mother so
now it is a basically a lace front wig
so it doesn't have about like three
inches of parting space or two and a
half inches of party space right here it
comes with three combs in the front and
it's just an adjustable strap in the
back with this one it does have baby
hairs but because it's synthetic and
they did it's it's super thick at the
ends like look at that like that's
that's a mess
this is this is a mess so with this one
guys I probably will really put this on
and be honest with you I probably have
to just play around with this one to
kind of make it go but the only one
that's honestly my favorite one maybe is
the is the second one the first one I
could deal with but this one mmm this
one is just kind of one of those one of
those myths so if you're gonna look on
the website to find I don't suggest
getting ones with like a curl pattern
like I like a like a curling iron
pattern if you find a curly one like the
one I just showed be previous to this
one then that one is perfect
but this one because it's so it's like a
curly wave type of situation they it's
just way too thick at the ends and it's
just hard to deal with
manage so I just don't recommend getting
away like this but the other tool
that'll do hey guys that basically wraps
