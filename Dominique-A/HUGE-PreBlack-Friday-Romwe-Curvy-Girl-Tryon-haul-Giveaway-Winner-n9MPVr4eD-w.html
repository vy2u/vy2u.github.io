information down below for you guys if
you guys are interested in purchasing
any of these items today now guys I want
you guys to wait to the end of this
video because I will be announcing the
two winners of the fashion Friday
giveaway so stay tuned for that and
Happy Holidays if I don't see you guys
bye next thing next week Thanksgiving
but I do have another wig Wednesday
giveaway next Wednesday so I'm sure
you're gonna stop by for that so guys if
you're interested in see what I have to
offer in today's video I would like you
to stay tuned and keep on watch all
right guys so I'm gonna start off with
like the sweaters and stuff that I got
first just because I got like a lot of
kind of lis these nice cute little
cropped top sweater things so I want to
show you guys this first to get this out
the way and not just kind of like the
hoodie sweaters I also got kind of like
t-shirts and stuff as well to this time
so the first thing I'm gonna show you
guys is this tie-dye style crop top
hoodie now I love tired I guys that I
love a lot of color mix is just so
pretty so when I saw this on the website
I thought it was really cute so it is a
size a large I believe and it is a crop
top style the thing that only throws me
off about this is the black strings but
I guess if you're wearing like black
bottoms it'll go well you definitely
wear white pants black pants jeans or
whatever but the black kind of threw me
off in the beginning but then when I
pasted it together an outfit I said to
myself oh it's not a big deal it's fine
so I thought that this was really cute
guys it was brought like maybe like
seven dollars or eight dollars which is
inexpensive AF so why would you even
like say why so it was really cheap so I
picked that one out now the next one I
got is a gray one I love gray in the
fall I love gray in the winter just a
cool kind of nice warm kind of inviting
feeling wearing gray I know that sounds
weird but that's just how I feel so I
also got this one this size large as
well no I actually got this on that
extra large now this one is really cute
it says wifey on it and I just like
corny stuff like this because I am wifey
so I thought it was cute and I picked
out and it's just like a regular basic
crop top sweater hoody whatever I know
people
kind of like kind of if you when it
comes to wearing crop tops in the
wintertime but if you're wearing like a
jacket on top of it like a longline
bomber jacket jean jacket leather jacket
I mean you'll be fine
just make sure you cover up all the
other areas you're just gonna have like
a little portion of your stomach out
which is not that big of a deal but if
you're someone I can't withstand a
little bit of cold then maybe this is
not a tough for you but for me I can
definitely layer this up and kind of
work them out correctly
now the next one that I got was one of
my favorite ones and when I got it I was
really excited cuz I was like oh my god
this is perfect so this one is black and
it has white writing on it and this is a
size this is a size 2 X now with this
website I just want to make sure you
guys know I don't take chances with
these the items off this website I like
to size up up up up up I'll even do 3 X
just to make sure that I'm really
getting the size a lot of these Asian
place websites still send you clothes
that are kind of like really small so I
didn't want to take any chances this
time so I just make sure I sized up in
all the items 2x extra large large just
make sure our size up and kind of looked
at the material to make sure that the
items were at least a stretchy in the
description because you don't want to
take chances with stuff like this
especially when you're spending your
money cuz you'll be waiting like 14 days
to get your money back or even send the
item back so it gets kind of tricky so
this was cute guys it's black with white
writing and it says cute but psycho I
totally love this I'm psycho I don't
care like I'm crazy but let's just him
crazy crazy in general like fun crazy so
I thought it was cute it's really simple
guys cute little low ball this is just
something you wear just to put on like
the most simple outfit kind of like a
laid-back bloke with jeans leggings
whatever it is so I just thought it was
cute and I liked it it's a material one
thing about these hoodies they don't
have like that fake polyester style
material that I absolutely absolutely
hate
so these hoodies are definitely kind of
like a mix of cotton material but it's
more cotton than whatever other material
they use so that's one thing I really
really like about these hoodies in
general now I got this little piece of
here that's just kind of like coming and
like stay in place okay yeah so the next
thing I got is another hoodie now this
one is white so I'm not gonna hold it up
to the screen because it'll wash me out
so
this one when I initially got out I was
kind of like mmm is it gonna work so I
really think that this is really cute
guys so it's basically like a white
hoodie and it has black riding on the
sleeves and it says East Coast if you
guys know I'm from the East Coast I live
in Connecticut so I'm like 15 minutes
and not 15 minutes I'm like 45 minutes
away from New York my boyfriend lives in
Brooklyn so it's about like an hour
drive for me
hour drive for him so I'm on the east
coast so I was like this is cute they
reppin the East Coast so I'm like this
is really really nice now white is a
thing because you definitely can get
washed out by it in the camera and
another thing when it gets dirty really
quick so I'm gonna probably try to keep
where I'm wear this to like a minimal
just because I don't want to mess it up
but it's definitely very nice soft
cotton material guys and it looks so
cute with jeans so when I saw this
outside have to get it I'm a black and
white sneaker type of chick in the
wintertime of just in general because
Wayne black or black by itself and white
by itself goes with everything so I
would definitely rock this with sneakers
and just about all these crop top
hoodies I'll rock with sneakers because
they are so cute now the next one that I
got is actually a long hoodie so this
one is actually my favorite one too and
the way I styled the outfit when I
showed you guys I thought it was really
cute so I kind of wore my short bang wig
or whatever and I don't know I just I
just loved it like I just liked it so I
wore like this short little pixie I'm
the actual like the short angled bob wig
with bangs and mmm girl I was looking so
cute in this so it's like a yellow
hoodie and you guys know i favor yellow
so much this summer I was killing yellow
I were yellow with everything this
summer so this is really cute guys it's
big yellow and in the front of the hood
it says staff on it on the back it says
I don't it says yeah instead of you it
says purpose loop or something London I
don't know what that is I don't know
where it is but I just liked it just
because it was yellow and it had that
cute little writing on it kind of look
like a rock band
sweatshirt like I went to a concert I
bought a hoodie but it's not so I
thought it was cute it says purpose the
world tour London 16 so I guess it's a
concert that was held in 2016 the world
tour London I guess the group is called
purpose hmm let me act like I know what
I'm talking about but I thought it was
cute guys so I picked this one out and I
got this one in a size 2 X 2 XL so if
it's perfect love is so comfortable and
I don't know I feel like with the
Chinese bangs and like it was cute if I
put a red lipstick on with this will be
cute
some leggings in my vans I just had like
the outfit ideas girls like ass so I
definitely had like a lot of ideas with
this one so I'm definitely going to wear
this one I love the brightness of it you
put a leather jacket jean jacket bomber
jacket on top of this an oversized one
which our vans some nice little leggings
with it in that little bang wig with a
Laurette lid girl you can't even tell me
nothing that's like style it's just all
in one now the last kind of like crop
top kind of sweater thing I got is this
really cute white shirt now I really
really like this white shirt guys now
when I first looked it on the website
that was gonna be more like a brought in
like smaller size looking and I didn't
know if it's gonna be so wide so it's
kind of like one of those wide loose
shirts which is good because if you're
someone that's kind of like top hags
like brought heavy or kind of like kind
of like really top-heavy in the breast
area you'll be so perfect with this
shirt I thought this shirt was so nice
the materials like a nice cotton
material it's very very soft and it just
looks so good when you put it on with
jeans you can wear with leggings over
the knee heel boots or not even over the
knee hill boots just over the knee boots
or whatever just I felt like a really
nice kind of like winter vibe to this
shirt and it has like this nice little
cross in the front area like like tie
area and that's the Train like driving
by like rolling by my house so I'm sorry
guys I'm here to trade in the background
this thing is so annoying I didn't never
record a video at a perfect time where
the trains not gonna come by yes yes yes
that's just what's gonna happen so
disregard that one guys please
so like I was saying guys I really like
this shirt I believe I got this one in a
2x or extra-large I read the material on
the website and I was unsure whether it
was going to be perfect so I just picked
the biggest size just because I didn't
want to get it and it was gonna be like
tonight guys so the next three items I'm
gonna show you are more kind of like
fancier but not too fancy but just items
you and we're kind of like into
incorporated into like a nice outfit so
the first time I'm gonna show you guys
it's kind of like a rapture it's like a
rapture now when I first tried this on
it was really confusing because I didn't
understand how they were constructing
the item now I'm not gonna pull it up to
you guys cuz it'll wash me out as
but it's a really really nice top guys
but the thing about is I kind of felt
like the way it was proportionate kind
of tightened in the wrong areas so I'm
gonna say that if you're someone that's
really busty I would not recommend
purchasing this just because it's not
going to fit correctly and if you do
have like a heavier stomach set it's not
gonna fit nice either so cuz there they
didn't flare in the right area so I'm
just kind of like why would you
construct something like that it's not
gonna be you know what I'm saying but
the shirt fits but I just don't like the
construction in the way they kind of
organized the fit in each section so if
you know what I'm saying guys just leave
a comment down below but it is nice it's
kind of like a blue and white pinstripe
shirt it's really nice for like
occasions like a Christmas party even
for Easter I would actually hold this
shirt off until like Easter springtime
because the white and the blue will
really look nothing to look nice like
fresh into the spring so I probably wait
till then but for some reason I kind of
like this and I kind of did it so I'm
gonna kind of keep it and kind of think
about it for a while and then formulate
an outfit to wear with it just to make
sure that you know it's not sitting in
my closet so I'm gonna try to work out
on work this out just to make sure that
you know I didn't waste my time picking
it out and showing you guys in general
so I'll definitely feature that later on
into 2018 so the next type i got is the
crop top that i've had i've been getting
from these companies for months and i've
been so obsessed with like i keep like
repeating like adding it to my cart i
just really like this crop top guys and
if you see and i featured a white one
red one and this is not black so it's
basically the crop top that kind of ties
together the breast area i've worn in
the summertime a couple of times we were
like oh my god where'd you get a top
from so i never got in black and i kind
of felt like this season is definitely
ready for like a black top like this it
is a crop top guys and is a bit sexy but
for this one i would say you definitely
couldn't layer up with this one if
you're going on a New Year to New Year's
party or any holiday party that's kind
of like an adult party or whatever and
you want to kind of wear something a
little bit on the sexy edgy side I
definitely like this a lot guys it just
has a nice tie area in the front I got
this one in a size large and if your
bust here than I am I would recommend
going the size up to 2x or extra-large
just because your boobs will pop out of
this instant
Dainius Lee like even taking a selfie
and like posing says I might like nip
came right out but I do like it a lot
guys it just has like an edge to it that
I like and I'm deaf and gonna rock these
the entire 2018 year round because they
are so cute and the fact that you can
tie it like at the top and the bottom
just gives you like and it kind of like
has that hanging tassel just gives like
a little bit of a flare and I don't know
I just like it a lot and that's why I
keep picking it because it's poppin so
the next topic that is more so like a I
call it like a peasant top or kind of
like a maternity top I just like it a
lot because it's overflow and it's like
flared it does kind of like those bell
sleeves are really trending now in a way
but it kind of cuts you off at the wrist
but it kind of has like a wide sleeve it
is white guys and I do like it a lot
guys it's really really pretty now when
I first saw this and I got it I was like
this is not like the peasant top that I
am used to getting because this one
doesn't have like it's not loose when I
got it the shirt was kind of stiff but
once you put it on you kind of like let
your body flow in it it kind of kind of
it kind of kind of it kind of like gets
a little bit looser so when you first
see you're gonna be like yo what is this
it's like paper mache right here but
it's not paper mache guys it kind of
flows together you know eventually so
when you put it on you just kind of let
it go on your body and it'll flow out
and look cute
but I definitely it reminds me kind of
like of a maternity top so if you are
pregnant you're looking for some of
these types of shirts definitely look at
Roman they do have kind of like these
kind of like oversized shirts or kind of
like maternity sell shirts they're not
Maternity style but I consider the
maternity style so it looks really cute
guys so I thought it was nice definitely
something I would wear for the spring
like 2018 spring or kind of
transitioning from winter to spring just
because it has that nice crisp white
look and it's just it's like nice and
elegant and regal and this winter is all
about the greens reds yellows and
oranges and if I forgot to cut let me
know but that's what I that's how I feel
that's right so before I skip on the
things that I liked versus the things I
didn't like I just want to show you two
items that I'm gonna add into the
giveaway as well so there's two things I
just didn't fit me so I rather give it
to someone else
I tried to squeeze my big old butt into
this dress and it wasn't gonna work so
this dress is kind of like a Paisley
dress guys it's white and has like this
you kind of like paisley design it is
kind of like a it's supposed to be a
mini dress but I'm gonna say if you're
curvier than I am it's not gonna thick
so it definitely was tight as hell on me
and it stopped like right below where my
butt was that numb but I can't do that
so I'm gonna add this into one of the
piles of the giveaway stuff so if you
didn't enter into this giveaway I'm just
gonna say too that there was a lot I
actually added extra stuff so what I'm
gonna do guys is I know you guys like
are you gonna do another clothing
giveaway I will do another clothing
giveaway this hunt until the end of this
year I'm gonna do be I'm gonna be doing
giveaway so this whole entire like
November to December I'll be doing
giveaway so if you didn't won this time
guys don't worry you have another chance
coming up so just stay tuned for that so
for the giveaway that I'm announcing
today I'm gonna add these two extra
items in there just for the person two
people that won so I'm gonna add this
dress in just because it didn't fit me
and I believe this dress is a size let's
see what size it is hello
so this one is it doesn't go what it's a
size large so it didn't fit me and I
should have known my big butt can't be
in that so the next thing I got was
supposed to be kind of like kind of like
one of those wrap shirts or whatever
like I supposed to wrap it this did not
fit me at all either so it's kind of
like this kind of maroon on maroon it's
like a tan color khaki color it didn't
fit me either guys I just could not get
myself into it so I'm gonna add us into
one of the piles - I'm not so low when I
select the winners for this guy's when I
selected cuz it's already done when I
selected the winners for this I didn't
just choose people that oh it's gonna
fit hurt no I randomly select to the
people so whoever won you won on a
random block guys so I will be sending
this one out - it's over it's a nice
little tight dress I would recommend
holding this off till maybe this spring
but if you were stockings in your
stocking wear and you have that with
definite wear with stockings because it
is a little chilly now in the East Coast
I'm not sure where you guys are from but
it's a little cold on the East Coast
over here so I'm definitely going to
give this away to someone as well - so
definitely look out for this - if you
get it in your giveaway box so there's
another thing
that actually didn't fit me either guys
but for this one I am actually going to
keep this one because I'm gonna have a
little weight-loss goal so this one
actually went on me but for some reason
this was super duper tight so I'm gonna
show you guys exactly don't tell my so
this one's like super tight in the arm
area so it's like kind of tight in the
arm area and I really liked it guys so I
was like oh my god it's really cute it
has like a nice pattern on it and my
sister's like oh my god can I get it and
like I'm like I don't know what I'm
gonna do yet so guys I probably won't
kick it to her but I'm not gonna let her
know that I'm giving it to her so I'm
gonna try to say oh yeah I'm gonna lose
weight and then once I lose the weight
which is probably I could happen to us
realistically speaking I'm pretty much
okay with the way I'm I am not honestly
losing weight is just not that work for
me and it hasn't worked in a few months
that I've been saying I'm gonna do it I
have probably lost me like a few pounds
but not weight loss that I usually am
able to like thirty I'm able to lose
like a good thirty pounds in a few
months and be good but I can't get to it
so I'm probably gonna give it to her
guys she just doesn't know yet
so so I do like it guys it's really nice
but it's a little tight for me so I'm
even I'm just gonna give it you know
what I'm gonna do you know I'm got to so
I wouldn't be fair if I gave it away to
someone in this giveaway because that
means they would have gotten two jackets
and what persona got one so I'm trying
to play fair I'm trying to be nice and
play nice but this jacket is really cute
guys I actually wish I honestly wish
that I could fit this and I wish they
had this one in a bigger size this one
was a size large and it's so cute it's
kind of like one of those nice kind of
70s and that's seven yeah 70s inspired
jackets so cute look at all that pattern
so it could be a goal for me to kind of
drop a few pounds or get my arms to be a
little bit smaller cuz I look so so it's
really cute but I'll see what I'm gonna
do with that but I definitely think
that's a cute jacket guys so alright
guys so there is actually one more item
that I'm gonna add into the giveaway as
well so this dress guys I tried to wear
it I tried to style it I don't know if
it's because the material so polyester
ish I just cannot vibe with this dress
at all now
does have that really cool kind of like
Rasta color band on the side the green
and red bin and it's a black dress but
for some reason I cannot vibe with this
dress at all guys I just I just can't so
I'm basically what I'm gonna do with
this dress I'm gonna give it away to
someone in the giveaway like I said I'm
randomly making two piles and sending it
to two people so don't you know I'm
trying to play fair I'm trying to be
nice so this dress is really cute guys
it just for me it just I don't know I
could invite with it and I didn't want
to keep it and think to myself like oh
I'm just letting stuff pile up in my
closet I'm not gonna wear it
I believe those dresses like a size let
seen this dress is a size extra large it
fits very nice it's almost like a mini
dress but remember if you have curl
curves it's gonna rise over the has to
go over the curves to be a mini dress so
if you got big curves is gonna shrink so
it's really cute as black as a spaghetti
strap dress and it has that cool little
Rasta color on the side the red and
green the material for me is what threw
me off its kind of like a polyester
material - silky - shiny and it really
will expose a lot of your loves dumps
and Trump's and whatever what are you
doing I mean so definitely will expose a
lot of you and I just I don't know I try
to find like ways I even try to put the
jean jacket on to try to make it cool
and I just wasn't cool enough and it's I
was like you know what I'm not I'm gonna
waste my time keeping this in my closet
because it would just sit there so for
someone else if you know someone that
likes you the winner you know somebody
will like it you give it to them as a
gift this holiday season that would be
great you know even if I send the I
sending these two winners something if
you don't like this stuff give it away
to someone for the holidays all this
stuff is brand new like anybody would be
thankful AF to get these items like
Hello so I'm definitely give this away
in the giveaways why because it just did
not fit now the next thing that I liked
is really cute now this one is a little
bit on the shorter side so I would
definitely say it wears some over the
knee heel boots with this one to give
the illusion like it is not that short
but when you got a little bit of a body
you know everyone's gonna just it's so
funny I would say this and I used to say
this a lot especially like in high
school and just in life in general
it'll be like me against somebody else
who's skinnier who's wearing the same
exact dress I would get the most amount
of hate or trouble wearing that dress
the person that's skinnier than me so
it's kind of like are they judging the
dress are they judging my body I don't
know if anyone has had that experience
in their life but every single step in
my life I've had that same exact
experience it's like we have the same
exact dress on the difference between
her and me is she's skinny and I'm
thicker and curvier so are you judging
the dress that we're we're are you
judging the body that I have against her
body and it is just kind of like it's
like in like in high school I so get in
trouble for office not even anymore
nothing crazy if it was like a skirt
that was a little bit short or it wasn't
in that short Hackett pasture you have
to stand up tall and your hand so the
skirt didn't pass her hands or your
fingertips it was considered too short
just random stuff like that like I
almost gotten marked as oh I can't wear
leggings because my butt's too big so
why so she can wear leggings because she
has no ass like I just it's like it's
basically like you're talking about
my body or you like you're like you're
like saying that basically I'm fat or
I'm not perfect I'm not the perfect size
which I know I'm not but it's kind of
like why why do people have to put it
like that so like with this dress it's
gonna be one of those dresses that I'm
gonna say to you if you are curvy you
can work opening knee-high boots or over
the knee over the knee boots period but
for some people they're gonna still be
looking at you like what are you doing
where are you going to the club so I'm
just gonna wear this cuz I don't care
I've been done with this stuff all my
life so it's just kind of like to me
whatever I don't really care so this
dress is cute it's kind of like one of
those little sporty dresses it has the
two lines on the side now it is a nice
olive green color and I love it it's a
really cute guys it is short and it has
two pockets in the front I love the
material it's a nice kind of hoodie
material soft cotton material guys it
looks absolutely poppin now I really
really like this a lot guys and I'm
highly recommend if you go on rhomboid
com definitely pick up this dress guys
it looks fabulous like I absolutely love
it it's so so cute guys and you cannot
go wrong with this one I think it gives
the body a little bit of a curve you got
a little shape in it you know put some
sneakers on maybe like a cute little
over the knee-high boots and you're just
looking like muddy green Cash Money
while that was embarrassing okay move
enough so the next thing I got is this
cute kind now in the beginning I saw
this on the model the model obviously
look different for one I look but I kind
of give it a chance though oh my god
it's actually pretty cute let me see
what I can do with this so this is kind
of like a long maxi dress and maxi
dresses I kind of like think about
summer when I think about maxi dresses
just because you don't kind of use maxi
dresses in the sense of winter so when I
saw this and I saw the cute little
pattern cutout I was that hmm that's
actually really cute so this one is
really nice guys it's pretty long and
it's um it's a basically like a black a
gray and black dress so basically the
paneling of the dress we're kind of
supposed to curve your body out is black
and then the the top part is gray and
some ears and gray in the back is black
you'll see you guys you'll see it so
it's really cute guys and I thought that
what the hair son everything game kind
of like more of like a edgy look Marc
upscale kind of fashionable love now
with this dress I would wear with like
tennis sneakers like maybe like some
really flat converse sneakers or like
some really flat vans I thought it was
really cute and gave me kind of like a
different vibe a different feel and I
usually don't do stuff like this but I
thought piecing this together
and put it like an outfit combination
together even putting a leather jacket
on it and even wearing my combat boots
underneath it even though it's like a
maxi dress what kind of look really nice
so I looked at oh say yeah this is
really cute so I'm happy that it
purchases I definitely versatile and
because it does have that cute sexy
black paneling where the Kirt of the
body curves that it just really gives
you a lot of sex appeal that you would
never think it would give you especially
a maxi dress with a turtleneck so I just
thought it was really cute the way they
constructed the dress was excellent they
did a really good job on so the next and
only kind of bottom that I got was these
leggings now I never got one of these
cool leggings ever but I saw it in the
website I wanted to try it out so
they're basically kind of leggings with
a mesh paneling kind of like in the knee
upper knee area upper thigh area I
thought that these were really cute guys
they're stretchy it does come with like
a little zip pocket pocket in the back
so if you want to shove I don't know
dollar in the back again I thought they
were cute these are size extra large I
believe very comfortable very nice I
usually tend to have a crotch in these
so what I would do with
we're kind of like an oversized t-shirt
on top of it I just like what I really
liked about this is a mesh paneling on
the leg I just think it gives a legging
character it is a polyester stop
material which is not my favorite but in
cases in situation of fashion and style
this works so I definitely wear these I
thought they were cute and very
comfortable and stylish at the same time
now the next three things I got are kind
of like outerwear the first thing I got
is a bomber jacket and I I like it a lot
because it's army fatigue army fatigue
is kind of like an all season type of
thing you could wear it all the time it
definitely looks very good during the
wintertime so it's a really cute bomber
jacket guys it has a lot of these little
patches on it cute patches on it and it
has the original original orange inside
so if used to wear the d-block Jack is
growing up cuz I'm I'm an East cotton
you know it sounds like everywhere so I
used to wear the little black jackets
and they call this to the they call
these so called the d-block jacket I
believe it was called and had the orange
inside and had the black outside we had
the green one and back then that's what
we call it and no one ever called the
bomber jackets until now until they try
to make it fashionable but they used to
be called d-block jackets I believe it
is if you know what I'm talking about
leave a comment down below that I feel
like I'm embarrassing myself right now
myself right now but I hope I'm not so
it has that old-school kind of vibe to
it and it's really cute guys it fits
very nice and I feel like it's something
you could wear with anything you can
style it up style it down very very nice
guys and I like how it's not so much of
a realistic army look but it's it's a
it's a bomber style jacket army fatigue
look so I thought this was cute and I
got this in a size large and it fit
perfect so the next thing I got is this
really cute cozy sweater now this one is
kind of weird guys because the pockets
are really high so when I was trying it
sounds like searching for the pockets
off buddies I like going like this down
looking as if they were downwards but
the pockets are like right really high
kind of like almost underneath the
breast part but I like the color-block
on this sweater so that's why I picked
it out I think the color-block was done
really cool and fun it's pink green blue
yellow its lemon-yellow huh like all of
you I guess or whatever I thought it was
really cute guys it is very very super
super soft so I'm assuming that this is
like a hundred percent like so
material it's not like that fake sweater
material so it's really really soft guys
really really nice and is definitely an
essential essential essential essential
layering piece for the for the winter
why am I forgetting what I need to say I
have no idea but you guys know what I
mean so I thought this was cute guys and
I picked this one out definitely a
statement piece for the Fall now the
last thing I got outerwear wise are kind
of clothes wise period seeing that my
area is empty is this kind of Cape style
jacket or like it's like a cape or I
think a sort of Cape so it's really cute
guys and when I were in the video where
I liked my fedora hat now that fedora
hat that you guys are asking me about
was from like three or four seasons ago
I forgot it from forever21 for $7 I love
that hat guys and I used to wear it like
all the time and it was really trendy to
wear those fedora hats but trends always
come back to life so I think that one
will be coming back to life and even if
it doesn't come back to life Dom's gonna
bring it back to life
so you see me wearing a fedora hat a lot
of my try on all its just because
sometimes I like to put outfit ideas
together so you guys can kind of get a
view or perspective on what the item
would look like when you buy it so this
Cape jacket is really cute guys it
doesn't have sleeves so I highly
recommend wearing a long sleeve with
this one just because you will be cold
it is really really nice I picked this
one out in a size I got this one in this
where's this I'm gonna list the size
down below so please forgive me so it's
really cute guys and I don't usually get
out of wear because I feel like it's not
gonna fit expecially from this website
but because this when is it Cape and
they don't have sleeves I knew it was
gonna fit so it fits really nice guys
it's something I would wear for the
holidays if you're going to a party you
don't want to wear it kind of like a big
heavy coat or your coats at the dry
cleaner you need something just to cover
up the area and we're like a
long-sleeved dress and long-sleeve
turtleneck shirt oh my god
that would be fabulous we're like a
little short like a middle part Bob the
fedora hat a turtleneck shirt and that
well I just I got I got a cousin part
outfit right there
and we're like a little pencil
I got it I gotta get a grip so the only
two accessory items I got in this Tron
hall guys were this headscarf that I'm
sporting now
so this headscarf it's basically cotton
it's not a headscarf it's kind of like a
cute scarf that I turned into kind of
like a fancy head scarf so bass kale
show you guys what the design look so I
basically wrapped it around my little
unit today and this unit that I'm
wearing is the mommy wave from Janet
collection and I will be reviewing this
wig soon for you guys you guys won't
believe how poppin this wig is so I
definitely wrapped it around and made it
into like a cute little body on the back
of my head it's a really nice design
guys it's very inexpensive on the
website as well they do have a red
colored one as long as well as this
green one but I in a blow too but I
decided to get the green for the season
and I just like it a lot it's really
cute and the style design on it it's
just in PEC oblique ooh you in gorgeous
so that's one of the acessories I got
now the next day I got a pair of shoes
now I was looking for some booties that
were kind of not hard to walk in because
like I tell you guys I'm not the type of
person to fake it out in heels because
it's really painful to wear heels
sometimes so I got these booties right
here now these are really good because
I'm a chunky heel type of person they
are really nice and the arch isn't too
bad so I definitely wanted some boots
like this for the season Duffey good for
kind of like those skater dresses and
like just any type of like holiday dress
or holiday look I'm going for these will
work fine it does have a stretch
paneling so if you have a bigger thicker
like back calf or kind of like a thicker
ankle or whatever this is definitely a
fit because it's really stretchy these
are a size 40 which converts into a US
size 9 so these definitely fit very nice
they do not give you any pain aches foot
aches or anything like that so they're
very comfortable and you get a lot of
support from the nice block heel in the
back so these definitely are nice and
perfect and they were really inexpensive
on the website and it's really hard to
find shoes like this so they did have a
lot of sizes available and these guys
are nice pointy and cute so I would
definitely recommend picking these off
from Romney because they're really
inexpensive in there alright guys so
