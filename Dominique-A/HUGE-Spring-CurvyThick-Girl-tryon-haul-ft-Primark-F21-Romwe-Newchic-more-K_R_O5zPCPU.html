going to be another curvy plastic girl
try and haul now in today's video I will
be showing you guys some items that I
purchased with my own money and some
products I would sent to me for review
now all the items will be listed down
below for you guys if you guys are
interested for some items that I
purchased I will have to put alternative
websites down there for you guys so I
will leave a star next to those items do
not forget to like this video guys we've
all your comments down below and also
hit that subscribe button if you haven't
already and all I want you to do is stay
tuned and keep on watching alright guys
so the first part that I'm going to set
up it is forever 21 now for what's
private 21 I just basically bought some
basic items I didn't buy anything like
oak lasting uptight or whatever but I
just got basics so the basics that I got
our two crop tops
now the crop tops are both in the sides
large and therefore thousand eighty
ninety cents now I got a black color in
the white color and they're the same
exact thing so I'll show you guys what
the black one looks like so it basically
is a crop top it has like this cute
little on design that's why I got it it
kind of has like a bra that kind of
style to it and it just has like this
cute little extra flap on the boob part
I just thought that this was cute and I
thought it would be really cute to wear
with my jeans high-waisted jeans or
maybe like a high-waisted pants or
skirts or whatever obviously it says
it's a crop top but it's a little bit
long I could have size down to size
medium but I wanted to place a vendetta
size large and I absolutely love these
two they're very cute for the summertime
and definitely for vacations and stuff
like that so I picked up two of them
black and white the next thing I got
were leggings now I often buy legends
from forever21 but what I've noticed is
forever 21 has actually stepped up their
legging game I actually got white this
time and I never get white but white you
know this year I'm just trying to be out
there and just trying to do whatever I
want I don't care about what people have
to say I never wore white before because
I just thought that I was too sunny
lighting or I just thought that you know
my ass is too big and it just would look
classy it's good but I don't care
anymore so I got a wipe here I got a
great pair and I also got a black pair
now I just want to show you guys how the
leggings are made now so basically what
forever21 has
they've made a thicker band on the
leggings so all the leggings are like a
super thick band and it's better when
you have a thicker band because it kind
of stays up the little thin bands they
had before they were kind of tricky
wearing them sometimes it would be like
to Simone you have them rolling down and
stuff like that but the thicker bands
that they provide on the leggings not
actually provide a better comfort and it
also stay up and actually look really
nice on so I definitely am happy with
that now the next thing that I got is a
pair of shoes now I went to Berlin
sinkhole Factory and there's one in the
time the next city so I saw these really
cute shoes and these are trendy right
now and these are Steve Madden slipper
shoes now the thing I liked about these
shoes is that they had that beautiful
fur design now fashion though will also
sell these but for some reason fascism
was always out of stock with items like
this so I just don't really bother
shopping or trying to get it get it from
fashionable because they're always out
of stock so I got this one from
Burlington cofactor in the Madden girls
they're size eight and a half and I paid
only $16.99 for them and it was a steal
if you have a Burlington Coat Factory in
the area they always have great items so
I definitely was lucky enough to get
this one and I think that this one is
actually really cute and they're like
really nice and furry so I'm very happy
with this purchase now the next thing I
want to show you some stuff two items
that was sent to me from that full duck
bull nut was example it was rom-com so I
have no Apple products in the club so
that Rahway calm sent me two items down
the first item they sent me is a
distressed denim jacket now this jacket
is a size extra large and I bought an
extra large because I thought okay it's
an agent-based company and the
likelihood of this item fitting me is
going to be slim to none surprisingly
guys the jacket is great it's almost
like an oversized jacket looks really
good on its distress like all over like
in the back area the arms are even too
long yeah well the arms on just shuts
but they're so nice that you could even
roll the sleeves up and make it look
real edgy wear a dress with it I just
really like this jacket guys it's really
nice and I highly recommend doing like
oversize jackets like jean jackets it's
really in trend right now so I really
really like this a lot
the next thing I got
it's really cool dobisch shirt I just
thought this is cute it's just a black
t-shirt and the black t-shirt basically
has just a basically two nipples two tix
on it and the front I just thought that
this shirt was so cute like and it kind
of matched perfectly my breasts were so
I was just wear this with sneakers and
like skinny jeans are just distressed
any jeans aren't just leggings I thought
this was cool and it's a cool pieces to
add together and you know and rock it on
now I just thought that this was dope as
 so I picked this up too now I also
got some items from a company called new
chic now new chic is almost kind of like
a romwe what else their place was like
in fact all those Chinese base websites
but this one is a really nice website I
was really happy when I got these items
I was skeptical in the beginning because
when you're buying clothes are not in
the small medium large category because
I were extra large and I know some
people think like oh bitch you're not
plus-sized I wear size 12
sometimes 14 and pants and I damn sure
wear size ledge to extra-large so I can
only go by what I am like I'm not
hundred fifty pounds I'm 190 pounds so I
know for a fact that I'm not gay I'm not
skinny I'm only 5 3 so I'm definitely
considered obese so but everyone shaped
differently I'm bottom heavy and top
small so I guess whatever so when I
order from this company what I actually
place the order I was a little scared
because I didn't think the items are
going to fit because I got an extra
large or what Chinese base website you
have to be careful but I got lucky
now the first romper I'm going to show
you guys is really cute it's long sleeve
and it shorts obviously it's lovely to
have the color and everything it's a
royal blue color and it has like these
cute little designs on the orange and
blue textures to it and design and it's
a little bit short and I'm really not
into wear like really short things
because I feel like I send people if I
do that but this is 2017 and I'll give a
 anymore to be honest with you I'm
just going to do what I want to do so I
decided to go for this one and oh my god
this one slays guys and I once the
picture comes on you guys mumbling bitch
like
this is oh my god it's so effing cute
this is a size extra large and it does
cut a body in this one guys I really am
going to kill this one this summer I
just love it
now the next blog jumper and I got one
was the jumper just robber and what the
 am I saying so the next word I got
is also from new chic now this robber is
cute too but what I love is to this
driver it's a little bit big it is a
size extra large but it because the
materials more like a silky material you
get kind of more room in this one now
this one has a cute little design though
it has a crisscross boob area in the
front I decided to pair wear this off
kind of like off the shoulder to make it
look a little bit more edgy or whatever
so I wore this off the shoulder to give
a little bit of sex appeal now this one
has a lot of crotch and the other one
that I showed you guys it's not elastic
so you can't make it smaller this one
you can actually pull the waistband and
make it smaller but the problem with
this one is that when you're trying to
make it smaller and actually gives you
longer crotch the crotch area on this
romper is a little bit looser and gives
you you know like I say it's a squash
plus so you have to be careful with this
one what I did with this one when I try
to kind of rolled it up a little bit
into the scene so that I can kind of
make it a little bit tighter but I
really like this one and obviously I
paired it with that hat the fedora hat
both farmers at the fedora hat in my
hair it just it's that perfect spring I
like I could smell the trees I could
smell the leaves with the fresh-cut
grass like right now like these are
really going to be it for me to use and
only my statements this summer because
it's just it's legit guys like legit and
I apologize as my life keeps coming in
and I'll explain and you know this the
focus is just all over the place but I
hope you guys enjoy this best farm now I
also got something else from no cheek
and you guys are going to blend bitch
whatever okay so it's more so far so
it's more of a different for me I
usually don't like order like shoes or
whatever from Chinese place left edge
because I'm very skeptical about like is
it going to be right so I picked up
these cuties right here now initially
when I first saw these I was kind of
like oh my god are these good
I thought
it like initially I was like oh my god
these are so cute the reason why I
thought they were really cute is because
they're clear jellies and they have like
this cute bowl with these like bedazzled
dye jewels on it and I just thought they
were so cute these are size 40 which
translates into a US size 9 the thing
about these is it looks like it's the
type of shoe that's going to fall right
off of your foot but because you're
going to be sweating your feet your
sweat actually sticks to the plastic and
it looks really good I just I don't know
like you can make us a boring-ass outfit
fun with these and like just we're like
a really regular ass top like a I don't
know like a genie I don't even know I
just thought that these were really cute
I would tell you guys what it looks like
on my feet but my feet are hella ashy
right now so and I don't have a pedicure
so I'm not going to embarrass myself
whatsoever but these are totally awesome
so I will have this link down below if
you're wild and free want to try
something out I thought these were so
cute and I'm sure I'm quite sure I'm
going to get compliments on it's like
where do you see this at like this is so
cool oh yes so the next stuff that I
want to show you guys is some items that
I got from a company called girly places
calm now girly places calm sent me two
items I actually was supposed to get 3
and I ended up only getting two but I
was like um care I did it was separate
review so they decide to send the other
one I'll just add into another haul it
is what it is so I got two dresses now
the first I'm going to show you guys I
wasn't too excited about the dress I
feel like it's okay like it could have
been you know I just kind of felt like
it was like okay when I saw on the
website it looks so much hotter but then
when I got it the materials not what I
thought so it's just black and white
contrast dress I just like it's an OK
dress but I'm not like crazy about it
like I just think like the material
could have been a little bit better and
the styling could have been a little bit
better like I mean you have to wear a
bra with this one you can wear plunge
burr or whatever you want I chose not to
wear a bra with it but I just kind of
feel like it didn't give me the feeling
that that I wanted when I tried it on so
I probably just this is not something
I'm going to rest in my closet but
almost I don't want to wear nah it's
okay so that's kind of like a it's like
an issue with this dress for me now this
dress is cute this is a white dress and
it's basically like one of those
it's basically like one of those awesome
awesome kind of long cardigan dresses
now I kind of size down in this one
because I did have when I put the dress
on I did have a little bit of room in it
so I definitely decide down in this
dress now this dress is really cute guys
it's been a simple fact that it's like a
nice Manila kind of like off-white color
and it hasn't those cute little buttons
going down a breast bar and it's like
accentuate your curves like you don't
have to work like a shaper I mean you
can wear shape if you want you don't
have to wear like all that extra stuff
because it just really sits on your body
really nicely so I'm oh I definitely
like this one guys I think that this is
a nice dress
the buttons are sturdy buttons they're
not the buttons that you put in and they
just flaps open these are very sturdy
button so you don't have to worry about
this slipping and if you want to wear a
tank top underneath it so that is a does
slip that no one really gets a good look
at you so you want to be looking at you
good slip so I really thought this is
cute I like this one a lot guys now the
next things I want to show you guys are
actually from Primark so I went back to
Primark in Danbury Connecticut and I
just kind of went all in I have like a
whole bunch of shoes and some
accessories I want to show you guys some
primer and I really I absolutely
absolutely love that store guys so I'm
starting off with shoes guys so the
first pictures that I got from Primark
these are were the most expensive items
that I got from this was the most
expensive from Primark this was $15 and
these are kind of like these floral
design loafers they do have like a very
very tiny like clasp of the heel so
small but I thought that these were so
cute these actually a size 9 I really
like them because they're black and they
had like this cute little floral design
I think you could wear this with like
leggings and the oversized Jean shirt or
something just like a plat I don't even
know I thought it was really cute and I
could really style this up for the
summertime it's kind of one of those
shoes that you just slip on your feet
and you go do a real cute beat face and
maybe like it it's just I don't know is
the options that I saw with this one
more endless I'd definitely pick this up
for $15 and this is the most management
at Primark that day like for an
individual items thing I have to show
you guys are these sandals
now these sandals I need them for
vacation because you guys know I'm going
away soon
so these sandals are very very plain I
just wanted some plain kind of
in Santos or the beach or just to slip
on when I'm just trying to I'm in a rush
or whatever
these were $4.50 and these are size 9
who came before down the $0.50 on
sandals like you've got to be kidding me
this is what the best price ever and
that's one reason why I really like
prime market their prices are perfect
now I got these right here now these are
basically like the Birkenstock inspired
sandals I always get a new pair every
single year they actually have them for
seven dollars they had white and they
had gold the gold one I like gold with
the gold ones that they had they're
worth like that official ask oh they
were kind of like that fake choppy ass
gold so I didn't get the gold ones and
the white ones don't look that cute on
my feet like I don't think they looked
that good so I kept it naturally black
and I just got black now this black is
nice because there's black on the bottom
and it's black over here and the belt
axel the actual belt buckle itself is
black now with these shoes they're
really comfortable you can wear them
like with any outfit you just kind of
you can dress it down and rest it up the
longer you wear these and the more the
older they get the better they are which
is so weird I just absolutely love these
shoes and I get a pair every single
summer now the next pair of shoes I got
are these cute little sandals just very
plain tan sandals I wanted to add it to
my collection just because it's plain
it's a neutral color you can basically
wear them to any summer dress any it's
just going to go with everything so I
picked these up and these were $4.50 and
I could not leave these these are size 8
and those actual Birkenstock inspired
sandals are actually a size 9 so 450 I
got two pairs of central for 51 for
7,000 and one for 15 like where you're
going to find us that only Primark has
this type of like I swear now the
next few things I only got two more
things from Primark I got a pair of
pants and a dress so let me show you
that so the dresses are from Primark
with $6 and it's just basically kind of
like one of those simple as kind of like
beach dresses I wanted to get this one
because I'm going away so I wanted to
have something that because just put on
like with my bathing suit and just go to
the pool or go to the beach and very
simple it's not like the best quality it
was only six dollars but for the price
and for the purpose that I needed a four
I just picked it up as like and I'm
going
it so 6oo is very simple very flimsy and
just whatever now the best piece of item
that I got clothing item was these pants
I absolutely love these pants guys like
these are so freakin nice like I love
the abstract design that they did they
did this color hand they kept like a
tribal print I think that's just really
nice they look good on I did get this in
a US size 12 and UK 16 so they're a
little bit bigger because the waistband
is elastic but I said to myself hey
whatever I'm just going to get them in
this size and kind of wear them kind of
baggy looking put my hands in my pocket
be all cool whatever so I opted for this
one in this side I just think these
these are very nice they're long they're
kind of like what do you call this wide
leg pants and they just look really good
guys I absolutely love it and the taxes
design on the front is absolutely
gorgeous guys look at that like that's
so cute
so I definite if these up and these were
11 dollars guys 11 and that dress is
actually a size 10 but don't worry guys
I'll link everything down below so last
but not least from Primark I got this
really cute choker style necklace now
this was three dollars and fifty cents
and it's just a gold choker I just
thought it was really nice to pair off
with any look I love gold accents so
that definitely was when I thought I
definitely was like I have to get this
so I got this when I thought that it was
just absolutely great and I was really
really excited so I picked it for 350
and the last thing that I got from
Primark are these awesome glasses well
this is not the last thing I got
something else oh my god if I could bite
it so these are also tattooed sunshades
and these are really cute guys these are
like kind of like a I don't run in that
explain because I don't really wear
sunglasses because I feel I could defeat
and defeats the purpose of wearing a
beat days but I'm going away so I wanted
to try some glasses so these are the
glasses that I got like these are
totally awesome I think they're like
really Beach ready and just so nice guys
so I definitely got these in each one
four dollars and fifty cents
I would could saw them and I like snatch
them off the rack be for my friends
because I was like so excited about that
so I have one model to show you guys
some framework
so I can get it all the stuff I need to
pick this stuff up so the last thing I
got from Primark would start at $5 and
it's a really cute side bag I was
looking for a bag that I can just wear I
don't wear handbags I don't like like
those bloody handbags that girls that
hold like this that's just not my style
I usually like to wear a bag like this
side satchels or things like this just
because it's it's easy for me I just
don't like to carry those big bags
sometimes it's just really annoying so
if you ever see me out in public you'll
see me with something like this or just
with a jacket back pocket I don't like
big purses or those big lovers like
movie batons and that's not my style I
don't do like that I just like
simple bags like this and I thought that
this was cute only five dollars precious
for traveling so I picked it up at
Primark for five bucks so that does keep
wraps up the video the video traffic
going to be pretty long guys and I'm
sorry if you guys are like slugs wife is
