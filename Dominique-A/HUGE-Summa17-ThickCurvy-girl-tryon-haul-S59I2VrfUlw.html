going to be another Kirby slash picker
trying hull now in today's video this is
going to be summer inspired trying haul
so some of the clothes I'm showing you
guys are from Cheyenne calm as well as
Rama calm and I'm also going to feature
some custom jewelry from a company
called Sol fool now everything will be
listed down below for you guys if you
guys are interested in purchasing any of
these items I'm really excited because
in 23 days I'm going to Jamaica so there
are a lot of pieces from this summer try
and haul that I'm taking with me and
they are popping now I want you guys to
thumbs up this video leave your comments
down below and also subscribe to my
channel and check out my latest videos
and if you're interested in seeing what
I have today I would like you to stay
tuned and keep on watching alright guys
so the first thing I'm going to show you
guys are the stuff I got from shy and
calm now I think she in or she inside
but I think that it's the same thing so
I'm going to run with she inside calm
because I don't want to make a mistake
and get like backlash but anyways so the
first thing I'm going to show you guys
is this really cute jumpy suit thing I
got now this is supposed to be kind of
like those hammer and stars inspired
pants but this one is the Jean material
so you're not going to get that sag that
you really want with these now I got
these in a size extra large and I should
have size to 3x because I didn't get
that bag that I wanted it actually kind
of made me look funny and I actually
recommend this for someone who's skinny
I don't recommend this for someone who
has a lot of curves because it just
doesn't sit right and my thighs are
really big so didn't give me the look
that I longed for so specially those
kind of like jump those like doll kind
of the jumper but it's kind of like one
of those faggy Hammer pants jumpers it
is a slight Jean material and it does
have buttons going up on the side one
thing I didn't like about this one too
much so that it has buttons going up on
the inner crotch part like your baby so
the inner crossbar and the leg part you
have to snap it together to wear it
which I thought was kind of cheesy just
because who wants to go through all that
to wear an outfit especially something
like this
I mean like if I don't have anything to
wear and this is my only option in my
closet a bitch is gonna have to put it
on so I just have to find ways to wear
it to make it look nice okay I guess but
it's just not one of my favorite things
and I mean I'll keep it just because it
can be one of those potential you ain't
have nothing to wear let's do something
so I can make something out of this now
the next thing I got is this kind of
like it's like a dress I don't think
it's a cover-up I think that's just a
dress now this is really really nice and
I've seen this on a couple of those
Asian based websites but I never had the
balls I guess to pick it up because I
don't know whether it's going to be nice
on me so this is what it looks like it's
a very nice long slit dress so I have
two splits on the side of the legs right
here it has this gorgeous pattern I have
not been able to recognize the pattern
this is I think it's just kind of like a
splatter of colors and that's what they
said is going to just splatter colors on
it and make it nice but it's outside
base is kind of like a light pink light
cream color and it does have the cold
shoulder look on the sides oh
Nicole so the looks on the side as well
as this crisscross kind of cleavage area
for this one I probably just wear a
banjo with this one I'm not going to
wear a bra that just doesn't make sense
there's just too much extra business I
would just wear a banjo with this one
and wear some flat sandals I thought
this was really really cute especially
with some hoop earrings this is
definitely potential right hand and I
just thought it was good great for the
beach great for just like some quick
quick outing nothing crazy to where you
just put it on with some sandals and
start up with makeup in here and then
you're gone now the next slide my dad's
very simple it's a really cute top
this whole criss cross kind of like tie
up things were like tying a shirt up and
then you're tiling your pants stuff has
been really trending so I wanted to get
this crop top it's just a plain black
crop top but the only thing I liked
about the reason why Eliza's comes it
was black obviously and then a little
lace up in the front the little lace up
in the front comes with a black string
which is cute and it's just kinda like
your basic top crop top with like two
strings I just needed something like
this in my closet just what I don't have
anything to put on top of like a skirt
jeans or leggings or whatever
I thought this would be cute just to
style up I do have a lot of black shoes
so it'll go with anything the next thing
I got is one of my favorites as well and
I really liked everything I got from
this place so this one is a distressed
jacket now it is not it's not pretty
it's not like a summertime jacket but it
is a summer transition jacket so if
you're transitioning from summer to
autumn fall then this work it's a very
lightweight but it is a real Jean
material jean jacket it is de-stress
perfectly and it's like it comes really
long so it's just about above your bra
or below about depending on what kind of
but you have but it looks so good on
it's very distressed it's oversized this
is a size large and I just like the
color of the Jean material on top of the
colors unit area to distress that they
did on this is amazing like it's really
hard to find a really good distressed
jean jacket and especially from a
website like Asian based website with
the sizing and everything this one is a
one so the next things I'm going to show
you guys are from romwe comm now I'm
going to show you guys the accessories
that I got first because that's always
important now the first thing I got are
these shades I really were shades just
because I don't want to block the beat
but this summer I'm going to step out of
my shell and try some sunglasses so I
just got this one pair of sunglasses now
these are like a red glare sunglasses
now these color glitter glasses have
been very like popular so I want to try
some red ones because red is always cool
for the summer and these are kind of
like a diamond with all shape is this
like a cat eye shape so I want to try
these out so let's see they're actually
pretty cute I wish that the lenses were
kind of bigger but I mean I guess this
is do I like the color the color is
really pretty so I thought this would be
cute to wear for my vacation you know
get it talking real quick or whatever
but yeah these are cute and these are
inexpensive and I'll link these down
below for you guys now the next thing
that I got from them are it's a pair of
shoes now I have another pair of loafers
that I got I show them to you guys
before from Primark side
pick these out and these are kind of in
style right now I guess the whole fur
inside of the shoe and then the whole
black but the buckle thing is in style
so I picked these out now these are size
40 a UK 40 which transitions into a nine
in the US size now these are true to
size they do fit very well and they are
super comfortable and soft inside the
fur really gives it that real soft
impression and they look really cute
now just wear these like regular stuff
like leggings oversized shirt basic rich
 but they're really cute and they
really can make it outfit way more
stylish so I definitely like these now
I'm going to show you guys the clothes
though that I got now I'm going to start
off with the clothes the clothing items
that I didn't fit well now this trip I
really like guys I honestly really like
this dress and I picked this dress off
just because if you if you're looking
for like a dress for like an event like
a wedding or something like that you can
definitely check out around week on they
do have formal style gowns so I picked
this one out no unfortunately this one
did not fit it did not zip on the side
part but the whole concept of the dress
was good I believe they only went up to
size large and I took the risk of
picking size larger but it didn't fit
it's a royal blue color it does expose a
lot of boobage and it is a sheer bottom
so it's super super long and very
elegant but it does not fit it doesn't
have that much great stretch so I'm
probably just going to give this to one
of my sisters who can fit it and if they
can't I'm probably also to someone else
who can fit it I might feel giveaway so
you never know but it's really elegant
and pretty and if you have a wedding to
go to or kind of an a bridal party or
something like that this would
definitely look amazing but the next
item I got is really cute now it is kind
of like a cropped sweater and there's a
size extra large and it's a baby blue
color now this one does have like white
writing on it and it does have like a
white string at the neck part
the sporty casual look and you could
just dress it up or dress it down I
thought it was cute with jeans so I
solved it with jeans and I will link
down the jeans down below if you guys
are interested I did feature them in my
fashion over try on how to now the next
item I got is a dress
now this dress is
very simple it is a size large and it's
kind of one of those like athletic style
dresses it does come with the stripes on
the sleeves - white stretch it's all
black and it has kind of like the hemmed
bottom so the front is shorter and the
back is actually longer so it doesn't
really expose you too much and it does
get some coverage I just think it's
really nice it's a cotton material which
is a plus and it just it's something you
can wear sneakers with just really make
it like a casual look and you can
definitely wear like a jean jacket
leather jacket it'd just be really
really cute I thought this is cute fit
the bag real well and it's just
something simple to put on now the next
thing I want to show you guys is this
green dress that I got and wardo dresses
are really popular right now so I picked
up two three Bardot dresses now the
first one is this green one and this
green one comes with kind of like a semi
cold shoulder so you have to tie the
size up right here this one is pretty
long it comes great about where the knee
cap is at it's a nice green army color
and it's off the shoulder it's very very
pretty it's a great material very
stretchy and very forgiving it
definitely looks good something simple
to wear to like a cookout just something
really simple that you can style up or
style down and I believe this is the
size large as well now the next one I
got is a really cute Tassili one now
this is in the color white and with
white I was getting nervous but since
I'm going on vacation it's going to be a
nice island trip I just thought that
this would be cute now this is white and
it comes with like these pretty tassels
on it
colorful tassels the tassels are at the
bottom and they're at the top as well
and this is an off-the-shoulder style
dress as well and it is super stretchy
very forgiving it looks really good on
and it's just something really simple
like I said that you can style up or
style down and I'm definitely wear this
on my vacation probably for the first
night out when we go out to dinner I
just thought it was really pretty and
something that I could wear on my trip
now the next one I got is one of my
favorites it's you can hear right now by
making noise so this is there like a
Paisley style dress it is off the
shoulder as well - I absolutely
I love this dress I don't know if it's
because it's a color in the color
complements my skin so well it is so
freakin cute so it definitely has a
cinch even tie it up in the waist area
as well at the top right here
very stretch it it's kind of stretchy
not too too stretchy but stretchy enough
it's for it's forgiving that's what I
want means that's what I that's that's
what I mean now I forgot what size it is
I'm pretty sure there's a size large or
extra-large but it looks really good
very simple a little bit of jewelry goes
a long way and it definitely is one of
those things that will look fabulous on
now the last item I got is this really
cute spaghetti-strap dress now the
reason why I picked this one not because
I absolutely love the color it's like a
mustard color and it's nice and kind of
loose in free now the reason why I like
this is because it's really strappy and
it has like a little design on the back
is a little bit of scary exposure on the
back and the color just complements my
skin complexion so well the mustard
color just looks really good and look
nice in the summertime especially that's
going to be trick just it's just really
nice I like it a lot
so I picked this one I think this was a
size large or extra-large but it's one
of my favorites is the last two items
I'm going to show you guys there's some
items that I got from soul fool.com
now it's a custom jewelry website where
you can pick out things like name
necklaces bracelets and stuff like that
so the first thing I'm going to show you
guys is this nameplate that I got now
this is very simple it's a gold
nameplate and it just says my name
Dominique on it I thought it was really
cute and I just really love stuff like
this I will show you guys an up-close
look of it but it's a god named plant
and just says my name and I just thought
it was really cute now the next one I
got is an infinity necklace this
infinity necklace I got you can get your
like names on it so I got my boyfriend's
name at the top and my name at the
bottom I just thought it was so true
when I showed him in he was like oh my
god that's so cute so I definitely
thought was I don't also something cute
suggestion I could've got like my mom
and me but I wanted to get me in Bay so
I can they have like things on it
the first bracelet says remember who you
are and those
I just like the glasses because like
dolger things that you want to remind
yourself every day so this one says
remember who you are and they're just
kind of like regular arm bracelets that
you put on and they're really cute
the next one that I'm going to show you
guys says please the next one says love
yourself and like I said these are just
personal reminder it's personal I don't
know something about these but I just
really liked what they said I just
thought it was really nice just a
hopefully these just go straight on my
 arm that's number one but
all they do Oh God so I just slice his
little personal sayings just because I
