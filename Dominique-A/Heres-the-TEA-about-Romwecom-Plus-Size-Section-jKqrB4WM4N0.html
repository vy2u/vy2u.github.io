another fashion Friday video today's
video guys is sponsored by romwe dot-com
so I did choose a lot of stuff from
their plus-size section and if you
didn't know they have a plus I section
so I do size 0 XL to 1 excel in there
plus I section and everything seems to
fit perfectly fine now as far as picking
stuff from the regular size if it's not
extra-large and it's only large I kind
of can fit it and then I kind of can't
depending on the stretch so that would
be careful when you're trying to
purchase the items and especially the
bottoms and the regular size because
that's where I always run into the most
issues but as far as this video goes a
majority of this stuff fit me there's
about three or four items that I had to
pawn off to my family because it just
did not work so this video is gonna be
pretty good guys most of the stuff fit
perfectly fine I did kind of clump in
outfits together so you'll get like
three reviews in one just to make it
easier so I'm not sitting on there
talking too much cuz I know you don't
like that or whatever so yeah so guys I
will leave all the information down
below if you want to purchase anything
from this website and if you're
interested in this hair the video will
be up in a few days so really enjoy it
right now and then enjoy the video
because it's a detailed video and you
guys will get all the juice so guys if
you're interested in seeing what I have
to offer in today's China huh I would
like you to stay tuned and keep on watch
alright guys so we're gonna kind of do
this video a little bit different so I'm
gonna show you guys some off some items
first and I'm going to show you guys the
set shoes that I got just because I
don't want to wait to the end to do that
- oh just do it in the beginning so the
first thing to show you guys is this
awesome tube top and I match this set
together so it's a pant it's the pants
the bottom and the top they're not set
but I made this it I made this into an
outfit just to make it easier so it's
just a basic tube top it is a bit long I
wish it was a little bit shorter so I
can just be like just at the breast part
but they made it kind of long so they go
like just a little towards your belly
button which is like it's alright
because you can wear this with
high-waisted jeans and make it into like
a bodysuit so I got this one in the
regular size and I got it in size large
and it fits good it's very stretchy and
I actually feel like it's a little bit
too stretchy so I could definitely size
down to large but these aren't really
good if you just want to put like a
simple top liner and just have like a
little bit of skin exposure like
shoulder exposure
actually really like this and I wish
otter got a few colors in this because
these are things that I would definitely
want to be wearing in the summertime and
the springtime is just easy to put on
and you're ready to go now I paired this
off with these kind of uh this was like
jogger style pants on the website that
always look different but then when you
get them they just look completely
different
these are SuperDuper see-through and
they're very very loose these are size I
believe zero XL or one XL I'm not sure
but I will link it down below these are
extra large they're just too loose and
the waist they're just like really saggy
in the crotch area it's not what I
expected when I got these but that's
what they look like and I was just kind
of like uh no so these I probably would
wear and I showed you guys I've wear it
with like a plaid shirt tied around my
waist and then that would be that for
this one just because it's not something
I was I would recommend just walking out
with because your entire cheeks will be
out all the nooks and cranny's would be
showing it just be like too much so I
would say try to kind of stay away from
wearing this with without something
covering your butt yeah also that
another pair of pants now these are cute
this fits pretty well but I wish the
pockets were deep on this one so this is
a black pair of jogger pants with like
this rainbow striped side I really like
the rainbow striped side it just gives
it a different look different feel great
contrast to the black because you don't
want to have all black on but obviously
I wore this sort of black strip up you
know what I mean but these are skinny
skinny ankles I don't know why I never
show the bottom of my ankles I just kind
of figure like if it's skinny you guys
wouldn't know so this is like an ankle
style skinny ankle style fits pretty
well these are very cute I just wish the
pockets were deeper so therefore you can
have more of that kind of like oversized
rugged look this one's kind of like oh I
could stick my pinky in here and then
that's it so I wish the pockets were
deeper but I do like the construction it
does have an elastic elastic waist so
it's very comfortable and it's not too
suffocating on so I definitely like this
for kind of like tucked in the type
shirt styles plaid shirt style stuff
like that I think this would be very
cute so I was really really happy with
this one versus the other one alright
guys so as far as accessories I'm gonna
show you guys like I hat and some bags
that I got so this is the first thing I
got in just really cute hat so this hat
guys I really liked because it had like
the whole pom-pom theme and if you guys
know I like love wearing those kind of
like cat ears with the pom-poms at the
top I thought that this was really cute
guys and I this was trendy like a few
years ago so
I have to get it because I was like you
know what it's so freakin cute so I need
this style just a little style like this
for a while so I picked this one out and
I just I don't know I loved it so much
and there goes a little pom-pom at the
top this used to be so trendy before so
I was like to myself let me just get
this hat and just you know let's just
rock it out so you probably definitely
see me in pictures with this hat but I
thought it was cute so I picked this one
out they think they had other colors but
I just went straight for black now I got
two purses and if you guys know me I'm
really weird when it comes to bags I
like bags that are that are kind of like
different or not I don't like like
handbags I don't like wearing stuff like
that I like wearing like crossbody bags
and you know mostly crossbody bags so I
picked this one out I like the color
block on it blue white red blue and
white and black I thought this was
really cute
something simple I don't need anything
big I just put like my phone in it my
cards and my keys and that's it
so I don't really have like too much
stuff and especially when it's big I
definitely will overclock like over
clutter my bag so therefore I like to
keep it minimal so I keep my you know
everything minimal so the inside is very
simple guys it has no insert inner
pockets it's very simple I would just
use this like I said if I'm going like
to the to the Museum the mall or like to
the movies something just simple to put
on and put on my arm and go it's really
cute too it's very trendy very
fashionable so that gives it a better
key is it well constructed no but for
the price and for the look it's worth it
it's cheap and it looks cute so that's
all I really care about and these
usually last me a long time all the bags
that I've ever gotten from romwe have
lasted me a long time now I really
wanted one of these this bag was one
that I was really going crazy about when
I saw it so this is basically kind of
like that it's kind of like that
knapsack look it kind of like scrunches
in it has like the whole knapsack look
and if you remember a few videos ago I
did another video on a bag that had this
same exact band so this one comes with
that band it also comes with a regular
regular strap like this and I absolutely
love bags like this one and this one was
very very I was like really excited
about this one because this one is
actually a little bit bigger and has
more space so therefore with this bag I
can actually put more stuff in it which
is a good and bad thing but
I have the ability if I'm going
somewhere different other than like a
small little movie date or something
like that I can bring this put my water
bottle and put a lot of other things in
his side thought thought this was really
good so I was really excited that I got
this one and I definitely like adding
color to my stuff so then adding this
cute little colorful band which I
already have is really cute so I thought
that this was well done together it's a
black bag but just adding that a little
bit of color definitely brought it to
like another level now I also picked up
these cute little stocking socks now
it's not quite the weather yet where I
would say that I would honestly wear
this I would probably have to wait till
it hits like the good sixty degree of
weather when I could wear like my
running sneak like my like sneakers
sneakers like my vans and stuff like
this to wear this so these are basically
like the ankle style um fishnet
stockings now I really think that this
whole entire trend is really cute so I
wanted to kind of wear like skirts I
wanted to like jeans skirts like regular
like skater skirts turtleneck top white
tunic top tucked in with my black of my
pants and these and maybe like a leather
jacket I like this whole entire outfit
idea plan but the weather has not been
giving me what I need so I can't really
execute execute execute oh my god I
always must set up I can't really
deliver that look yet so I'm definitely
gonna have to wait until the weather
gets really good for that but I really
think that these are really nice guys I
do have like my foot is like a US size 9
so u.s. eight-and-a-half US nine so
these should be able to fit so I'm
really excited to wear these once the
weather is promised moving along guys so
I'm gonna show you guys a series of tops
that I picked out so the first thing
that I got is this really cute little
zip up crop top now this one isn't a
regular size large guys it has a cute
little zip with this little really cute
little keyhole zipper this is really
popular on their website a lot of their
dresses come with this little keyhole
thing I thought this was really cute cuz
I like the little rainbow right here at
the collar and it's black so it kind of
gave it like a little bit of extra
detail it is ribbed it fits pretty good
it's super stretchy though so you could
size down to medium if you're busty you
should be fine with the large but I
think this is really cute something
simple to put on if you don't have
anything to wear or you want to kind of
jazz up an outfit a little bit I think
that I thought that this was really cute
now the next thing I got was from the
plus-size section I got this in a zero
XL
now I thought this was really really
cute guys and I still think it's cute
like I saw it on the website thought it
was cute so it's an army fatigue style
shirt and it has the cold shoulders I
thought it was really nice because it
has a nice relaxed feel to it it has
this really realistic army fatigue
pattern sometimes would get like some
from a company and it's kind of like an
ashy tone not so realistic looking type
of army fatigue pattern but this one is
actually really really nice the
materials like a mix between cotton and
polyester but it's more cotton material
very soft I like this a lot guys I think
it's really cute and the sleeves thank
God aren't aren't long sleeves they're
like just like kind of like 3/4 things
are kind of short sleeves so I thought
it was really cute and comfortable so I
thought that this was a good steal
now the next up I got guys is this
really cute bright yellow hoodie now I'm
not gonna hold this up too far up to the
camera because it'll wash me out but
it's really cute it's yellow and it says
melanin on it now the website has like a
lot of these screen T's si melanin on it
I just thought it's really cute so I
picked this one out guys and it fits
really nice is the size large I got in
the regular size so it is kind of like I
wanted it to be more of like a crop top
hoody but for some reason this one
appeared a little bit more bag here than
I wanted it to be but I still think it's
really nice very very bright I love
yellow colors orange collars bright red
colors bright fuchsia colors on my
skintone so I thought that this was
really cute so I picked this one out now
I also have another shirt that I
actually left in New York so stupid now
the show I'll just show you guys a clip
of it it's a really cute crop top and
it's yellow now this one fits very good
and exercise large now when I put that
one on guys it was really hard to put my
arms through it like it was kind of
really tight but it actually felt really
nice once I put it on now that one I got
in the size large and that one says yes
daddy with the question mark and I
thought it was so cute yeah it's really
cute so I thought that was cute I had a
word like last week and I forgot I left
it at my boyfriend's house so I'll
insert the picture of it and you guys
will see what it looks like it's really
cute guys I thought the crop top was
legit definitely get that one if you're
the type of person I'd be using a word
daddy so I thought it was cute well that
was embarrassing so the next top that I
got guys is a really cute top very
simple black top now for this black top
I did pair it with
one of the dresses that I picked up in
the website so I'm gonna show you guys
them together so this top is the screen
tee it's a size large and it has like
those two kind of like boobs like
imaginary breasts with like now this one
has kind of like heart shapes in the
nipple area I thought this was cute I
have another one like this but I thought
that this was really cute I wanted to
pick this up because I have the key
hearts on it this is an oversized
t-shirt guys it's not a fitted size
large t-shirt and straight off the RIP
when you kind of straight off the rip
when you see the collar you can just
tell it's kind of like when it was
relaxed style t-shirts so I thought that
this was really nice guys it's a nice
cotton material very soft so how I pair
this office I paired it off with this
this kind of like um like surplus dress
like it's this dress is in the plus-size
section it's kind of like a jean dress
but this one is weird because the back
of it it was so confusing I put on the
back has an area where you can actually
put a white string that it came with in
the back but I do not like the way that
this looks so what I ended up doing is
using a corset that I got from romwe a
few reviews ago and I added the corset
on top of this to kind of make it into
like kind of like a fun kind of
structured type of outfit I actually
really like the outfit guys if I put
some sneakers on with that I thought it
would be really cute but I don't really
like the way they created this if you
don't kind of put like emphasis on are
they putting like a belt or something
it's just gonna kind of fall flat and
you're gonna just look like an oompa
loompa so I really thought that I really
needed to kind of you know add stuff on
it but this is what it looks like it
does come with like a little white
string to strap up the back but this is
a size extra large and even the string
was just it wasn't tight enough and it
was like too big so I thought that
putting a waist belt or like a corset
belt on it would just be better it just
kind of mixed patterns like a jean
material with like a fun corset and like
a fun t-shirt I was just trying to mix
patterns together trying to you know
create like some type of look so I
thought it was cute though so this
outfit together is cute I don't know if
I'd necessarily wear the dress by itself
without like some type of long sleeve
shirt or some type of screen tee just
because this shirt is the dress is just
weird and on top of that it's short AF
alright guys so out of the whole entire
how I only got one swimsuit so this
swimsuit was very cute guys it's black
and I just thought that it was really
nice the way they made it now if you
watched my last Tron haul which was a
swimsuit trial
my first one for the season I did tell
you guys how when you get where certain
high-waisted bottoms like if they add
little details until like little Criss
crosses and like openings on the side
and stuff like that I usually feel like
it really kind of gives your body a
better look so this one sue definitely
it was just perfect I love the way the
high waisted bottoms were they kind of
had like a little detail design on them
so it kind of gave you kind of like a
little bit of style a little bit of a
shape as well too
the top is super duper cute guys it's a
type of top that's not gonna give you
too many folds in your back fat and it's
just really supportive now one thing I
didn't understand about the top was the
cup size the cup size for me just did
not fit my boobs my boobs are either
Hank spilling on the side or they were
spilling down it looked like a pretty
big cup size so I assumed that they
would fit but these just didn't fit and
I think I got this one in the size 1x or
0 XL or extra-large to see I got in size
extra large so I probably need to decide
the top a little bit big and then do the
bottoms I've been finding the
extra-large but I just thought that this
I honestly still know where honest to be
honest is you guys gonna have to find a
way to kind of like disguise my boobs so
it doesn't look like I'm uncomfortable
or it doesn't fit well but I thought
that this swimsuit was very nice guys it
was well-constructed you get a lot of
support in the trunk so you get a lot of
support in the top if your boobs fit in
it but it's very supportive and I feel
like it's the type of swimsuit once you
get wet in it it's got a nice it's gonna
shrink it's gonna like shrink up on you
fit you nice and it's going to be good
so you don't have to worry about it
being kind of like saggy looking and
kind of not being like you know
comfortable in the swimsuit this
swimsuit is definitely comfortable and I
definitely like this one a lot alright
guys so I have a few rappers that I want
to show you guys now I'm not someone
that's really big on rappers just
because sometimes when it comes to
rompers it's like just too short for me
because my butt's big so I took a leap
of faith this time I tried some out so
the first one I'm going to show you guys
is the size zero XL now when I read the
description I maybe just look past it I
assumed that this was gonna have a good
amount of stretch that was gonna carry
me through I definitely should have size
up till one XL on this one because there
is absolutely no stress stretch on this
one but it's really cute I almost wish
that this was um longer as well too
because it's just too short this would
have been the perfect romper to wear for
Easter it's the colors and everything
are just so nice
but like I said I got this in a zero
Excel and it's kind of like a creamy
white color I'll show you guys to the
side cuz it's gonna wash me out I
thought it was really nice guys to
design it definitely it definitely gives
you a body that looked like my butt was
looking real big in this one but I
thought it was cute but the one thing
about this is just too tight like I
honestly won't wear this because it's
too tight unless I lose like another 15
pounds but I thought it was cute the
pattern was good the floor design and
the white this looks really good it is a
little bit boobie so I would say if
you're someone that doesn't really like
showing all that we're like a cami
underneath it so it is kind of like
boobie so that's the only thing about it
it's like a really nice classy look but
then it just gives you all that job with
the breast area especially if you have a
bigger bust but I think that this is
cute I would recommend sizing up in this
one just because this one it has no
stretch so you're not getting any give
or Nothing now the next one I got is one
of my favorites this one is red and I
already told you guys I love red colors
bright red colors orange you know yellow
those types of colors for the summer and
spring for the spring and summer so this
romper to me was one of my favorites I
just love the way it looked on my skin
this one is a size zero XL I believe I
believe I believe I believe I will link
it down below for you guys so this one
is it is their XL so this one is super
cute it kind of has like those little
kind of fanned out sleeves it does have
a tie but to tie the waist and it has
kind of like a little bit of a peplum on
the on the on the shorts as well too at
the end of shorts which I thought was
really cute I absolutely love this guy
simply because of color it just
complements my skin so much and it looks
really good on I honestly said think
that this is like a nice materials very
loose fitted to so therefore you're not
scrunching like really stuffed in this
one I felt like I was really comfortable
in this one I had room to breathe and it
just looked really nice and it didn't
look like a cheap outfit it's something
you could definitely wear if you go on
that on a date night if you have an
event to go to and you were like some
wedges or something I would just be so
nice and maybe like this little
hairstyle - yeah it would just be like
really nice I really really like this
one a lot guys now the next wrapper that
I got was it's a little bit too big for
me but I'm still gonna wear it anyways
because I'm always about being
comfortable I'm not I really like to be
comfortable especially in the summertime
when it's really hot and sticky
do not have time for that at all so this
one is totally cute guys now this one I
think I got in this size 1x know what X
because this one does fit a little bit
bigger than usual so it's basically like
a black romper guys and it has like your
nice floor design now this one makes me
feel very comfortable guys I don't feel
tight in this one I feel very secure but
it is a little bit long the larger size
guys it does have an elastic band waist
it shorts but it's very nice guys you'll
feel very comfortable in it and I just
think that the color and everything is
good I like the roses with the black
design I just really really liked that
when I said in the website so I picked
it out so I don't know I'm gonna rock
this one even though it's like a little
bit loose on me my sister my older
sister lost tons of weight so she came
and wear this stuff anymore and maybe
one of my friends maybe she wants it if
I don't find a way to utilize that I
probably give it off to one of my
friends but I think it's cute I think
even if you put like a cardigan sweater
on it or something like that would just
be really nice I thought that this one
was definitely us yeah the next two
things I'm gonna show you guys are the
only two dresses that I actually got
which is weird because I usually pick
out a lot of dresses now this one was
from the regular section but for some
reason the way they constructed this for
me is just a no like the dress fits but
I kind of feel like the way they divided
the dress up into two sections the
bottom section where it's gonna be like
where you're butting your stomach that
is just too tight I wish they would have
loosened that part out a little bit just
because it accentuated the body a little
bit better but this is really cute it
has those really cute floral sleeves
they have like a floral pattern on the
sleeve I definitely like cause like
burgundy as well - very good complements
the skin as well - this one is a size
large but it said it was a little it was
like kind of like an oversized so I kind
of trusted the detail on the description
and I picked it like I said it just kind
of hugs you in the wrong places like I
feel like it shouldn't hug in your
stomach and it shouldn't be too tight on
your but I feel like the top should have
been like kind of like fluffed out and
the bottom should be fluffed out the
part where they put the seam at the hip
should have been the only part that was
kind of restricted and then it should've
came out into like a nice you know like
a nice kind of like a skater dress but
they didn't construct it that way and
and basically turned into like a really
really tight dress so I probably won't
even wear this to be honest with you
guys but my sister likes stuff like this
so I'll probably give it to my sister I
should have just gave it to her
so I'll probably give this to my sister
because this is something that she likes
and this something I showed where from
me not so much just because the way they
constructed it was just too weird for me
but I do like the sleeves do I like the
design and like the color so the color
and the whole construction the color and
the design is very thoughtful and I
thought it was really nice now the next
dress I got is white so I'm not gonna
pull it up but it's really cute now when
I try this on I felt like a lot of
summer spring vibes I don't know I have
like so many outfit ideas with this one
just because I could wear wedges with it
I could wear like a cute little sandals
with that and even if I had like a
simple baby shower like a bridal party
to go to or something like that it would
be like a really nice dress to wear it's
very simple guys it's kind of like a
light blue like gray and white kind of
dress it does have that tie in the front
so I got this one there's air excellent
and the breast area fit me fine it does
have stretch to it so even if your boobs
are large as long as it could cover
pretty nice you can tie it up which is
good the bottom misses weird the top the
top fifth fine but when it came down to
the bottom section it was a little too
big so I kind of have to keep pulling it
down so that it was just not like
hanging on my waist but other than that
I thought it was nice it's more of a
dress-up type of dress I wouldn't wear
this if I was just running out the house
and you to put sneakers on go just
because you would I really would have to
think about an outfit for like an outfit
like a look for this like the dress can
I wear with sneha like a little Skippy's
white Skippy's or sandals and am I gonna
wear my hair long or am I gonna wear my
hair short these are the things that run
through my head when I'm picking out my
office so I would kind of to contemplate
this one when I kind of picked this one
out so um it would just take me a while
to kind of figure out what I'm gonna
wear but I do like it and just the fact
that you can dress it up or down it's
definitely a good thing so the last two
things I'm gonna show you guys in this
entire haul and I know it's super long
but we're gonna get this we're gonna get
through this and be done so the last two
things I thought were jumpsuits now I
don't usually pick up jumpsuits from
websites because I have like this thigh
ratio thing leg ankle thigh ratio upper
body ratio that just doesn't work here
it just doesn't work for me but I took a
chance with this one just because I was
on the website I was looking looking
looking and looking looking and just
trying it I don't know I was having a
hard time so um this is kind of like it
almost looks like a onesie like a
sleeping onesie so it's kind of like one
of those note fashion know what kind of
jumps to things now
this one has a zip that goes all the way
up it's kind of weird because a zip all
the way it goes all the way up to the
top of your head so am I gonna like lock
myself out close myself in shut myself
in I don't know but I thought that this
was cute guys it has two pockets in the
front now it is SuperDuper stretchy but
this one is really nice guys definite
gives your body a little bit of a hmm
but this is not something I per se would
wear like just out the house like oh I'm
about to put my sneakers on and go I
want to wear this just to where I wear
this if I honestly was like really like
bummed me one day I wanted to be
comfortable and I would just put a
jacket over and just walk outside if I
was running small errands but I don't
think I would like put a beat face on it
maybe you know what I'm not going to say
that cuz I probably will you probably
end up seeing a picture on Instagram
about me doing that but I don't know yet
but I just don't really think it's that
great so I'm not sure if I'm going to
wear it like that but it's comfortable
it looks nice and it fits great guys so
definitely check this out now this jumps
to right here guys I got in the regular
size and I got it in a size large now
this one definitely has great stretch to
it put the issue with this one is I
cannot snap the sides close so I'm
coming to you guys show you guys it's
just the way it is without the snaps the
sides really snap shut but I do like
this I did add a belt on that I got from
romwe Waldo and I added on just as an
accent belt so I really like the outfit
once I did that because I like
accessories I like to jazz things up
it's really nice guys super long hits
the floor but like I said I cannot close
this up because my thighs are too big
but I definitely like it the bra cup
area is perfect it has an adjustable
strap it's very very sexy guys but at
the same time if you're a bit slimmer
they may have smaller thighs and you
could get away with this it's definitely
a trendy jumpsuit I've seen on every
website and it's an inexpensive on this
website so I thought it was cute but for
me it's kind of like a fail because I
cannot wear this out the house at all
