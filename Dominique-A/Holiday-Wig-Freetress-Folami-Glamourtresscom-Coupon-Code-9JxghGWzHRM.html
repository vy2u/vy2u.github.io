private show me what you want to know I
will give you a lot more I'm
we love blue white I'm slow he's gonna
be private oh yeah I know so this is
what the unit looks like so I basically
just put a hat on it just because I
thought it looks so so wintery with the
hat and so fashionable with the hex
where she put my cute little outfit on
today so I just decided to put the hat
on and just kind of wear it like this so
the follow me wig reminds me of Karissa
mixed with Danity honestly the only
difference is that this one has a little
bit of color it does still have that
very very large curl pattern and very
very sexy sultry look I do feel like the
color has kind of enhanced it a little
bit the little highlights that are in
here and the kind of like brown texture
that's in here makes it look really
really like sexy and really really nice
for the fall season in the winter season
I really do like this and like I said I
did add some of my technique aren't wild
styles next day here texturizing spray
at the top just because the top is a
little bit flat and it didn't have too
much texture it was kind of shiny at the
top so I added that on the top the rest
of the hair is very nice guys it has
like a really nice african-american
texture the hair is super super super
super super soft I use a wide tooth comb
just to run it through one thing I would
say that this wig might be the type of
week that will swell up but you just
have to really not play around too much
and kind of keep it the way you got it
which means keeping the style don't try
to put products in it or try to be too
crazy with like extra stuff especially
don't put oil in it that would just ruin
the hair I do really like it like I said
it does have like this really nice kind
of like um wintery vibe I do like
wearing it with the hat I think the hat
looks really cute with it it just gives
you more of like a fall look but like
this itself it looks really nice like
this guy's it reminds me so much of the
crystal wig guys and so much of the
other of the dan80 wig but they are from
the same brand so they do kind of keep
the same style in mind or maybe I'm just
picking out the style that's the same
joy Dom but I really like this guys I
