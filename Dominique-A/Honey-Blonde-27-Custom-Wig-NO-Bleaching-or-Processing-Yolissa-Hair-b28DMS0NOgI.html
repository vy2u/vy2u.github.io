unit so I definitely had a little bit of
a run through with this unit I had to
kind of figure out how I was gonna style
it how I was gonna wear it now this is
basically like a full honey blonde
colored unit that I created now the hair
was sent to me from you olesia hair
company guys so they sent me four
bundles of hair and a closure and I use
every single inch of that hair that was
sent so I was sent to 22 inch bundles to
20 inches in an 18 inch closure so this
is a super super full wig guys about 180
percent to 200 percent density I
absolutely love this freaking hair so
far guys now this is their number 27 and
if you don't know 27 is like kind of
like a honey blonde now this brings me
back to the vibes of like when I first
started bleaching like natural hair or
like one be here and you'll kind of get
like that honey blonde color you get
like a really brassy or color than this
so when I kind of got this house I
thought my god this reminds me when I
was first starting and you know I didn't
know how to do stuff but this one's a
little bit more a tailored guys so this
one came to me very soft guys that's
number one thing about this hair it's
super super soft now you already know
when you're processing here and stuff
like that especially you get from
companies you can run it to like dryness
I have there's no dryness on this hair
at all this hair is super soft it
doesn't tangle and it doesn't really
shed that much which is actually
surprising no as far as this here being
like 22 inches long it's actually pretty
long guys so it stops about like right
where my bellybutton is that so I would
say it's probably like a 20 to 24 I kind
of felt like all the Pat the hair match
very well but this hair did come
straight but as well as matching I mean
like the frontal was the same color as
the bundles which is very good I did
notice that in the bundles it actually
kind of looks like it's like a mixed 27
and 613 it looks like there's like
Hinson 613 in it as well so I like that
because when you curl the hair and when
you kind of we're starting Styles you
see dimensions in the color instead of
it all being one flat color which I do
like about this so guys I really do like
this one thing that I had an issue with
is like all the time I mentioned this in
all my videos with colored units now
color units I find it particularly
difficult to kinda do the baby hairs
this time around I kind of managed to
kind of find a way to do our words
I gotta look crazy so I did use my NYX
tinted mascara brow mascara and I kind
of went in and made like light dark
roots so my mascara is kind of like a
dark brown color I actually linked it in
here I don't remember what color it is
so um
I used that I went like maybe like a
quarter or not even a quarter like a not
not even like like a third of an inch
into here and just do like a little bit
of that mascara tinted brow mascara I
also did it and the areas where the baby
hairs came in as well too so therefore
it looked really natural now I mentioned
this in my last colored unit video that
I did that it's really hard doing baby
hairs on colored units so I definitely
had to tweeze a lot in this area to kind
of pull the hair out and kind of make it
look like you know it will look with
like an actual black colored wig so I do
like this in the beginning when I saw
after I made out uh oh girl I can't do
it
my boyfriend was a little bit like mm
you're gonna have to work that up
because you know put the skills in um so
I definitely have to fix it when you're
first getting here you're gonna make a
unit don't think you about to just slap
this on your head you really have to
customize this so it looks good I think
that the closure is actually pretty good
as well to guys um I actually had in the
middle part didn't really fill the
middle part too much so I decided to
switch this to the side my usual side
and I think the side part looks really
nice the wiggly is pretty flat guys um
yeah this is the wig that I created so
legs pretty flat and I have like a
medium cap size head so guys I will
leave all the information down below if
you're interested in purchasing these
bundles and this closure from you alicia
