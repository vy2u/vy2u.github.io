another wig review and this is wig
Wednesday's continues so the way I'm
going to review today is away from I
think this is red carpet premiere and
this is the lace front wig and this is
the cut this is the style oh god I knew
that oh they do have a name it's called
Amber and RCP 767 now I get I got an
ombre style way but I decided just to
get a full colored wig so this week that
I'm going to show you guys is a
completely honey blonde way but
obviously I'm going to customize it even
though synthetic by trying to add like a
little bit of dark roots at the
tippity-top they do have some air like
the one B of thirty with the dark roots
and then the kind of like the color like
this or lighter color like this at the
bottom but I didn't want to do that just
because one be 30 so born so I just got
a whole honey blonde wig and I'm going
to customize it and see what it looks
like these are synthetic units so you're
going to get that ass you're going to
get you're going to get that shininess
I'm going to try to ask about a little
with some spray and yes but let me show
you how to do unit looks like I'm really
excited about it and I just I'm just now
opening with you guys because I may get
a chance to open to see it yet
so this is what the wig looks like I
it's pretty pretty pretty and it's kind
of like this nice pretty wavy color it
does come up with this orange brassy
color but I'm going to I mean you can't
really do anything about because it's
not human here so I'm just going to try
to make it look nice on me so I'm really
excited about this unit guys a desktop
cold one home in the back and two combs
they're the part that it is supposed to
have like this nice realistic looking
part at the top like I said I'm probably
going to just go in add some little bit
of dark recesses have to try to make it
look a little bit more realistic it is
about like a 14 inch length and it's
kind of like a wavy pattern so I'm
really excited I've been loving my like
shorter length pairs which is big
fluffiness and themselves yeah so if
you're interested in seeing what this
baby looks like I want you to stay tuned
and keep on watching
ya don't know Padma
yeah yeah quasi-periodic video yeah it's
apartment in a bottle might fit on that
we have economists come when you watch
w-what unlikely stereochemistry Madonna
Jeremy no now Mike und animal but wonder
why gnam gnam gnam articulate but Monday
why not tell me what you want them to be
on oh goodness control godmother here
love no wine and flu you wanna be
private cure leader tell me what you
want to do I believe you all that more
admirable of you
why uncle is gonna be private through
your friends they sell you think athlete
your eyes alright guys so this is what
the unit looks like I'm very very
pleased with this hair initially when I
put it on it was looking like wow I
usually do side parts I think this
little cute at the middle part to its
whatever you choose but I like it in the
side part I was using some tie I did add
some mascara to the roots I had to do
that off camera because I accidentally
almost messed up so I wanted to make
sure I like solidified it and fixed it
way before I can like really make it
like a hot mess I kind of went in all
too dark and low to stick right here to
tip so I kind of had to like spreading
out a little bit to make it look more
realistic but it looks really good from
the sides I turn I just think this looks
good and I'm happy that it tells the
honey blonde because the honey blonde
you can actually customize it so but if
you're someone that just like straight
honey blonde here this is a nice honey
blonde color if you're looking for a wig
like this I really really like this
guy's the cut is pretty it's like I
thought
49 3/4 well like a 10 or 12 inch which
is really cute do you see kind of a like
those soft curls or soft waves which
makes it look so nice and natural I
would wear this like if I was going to
church or something like that but I
would just wear a black one but like if
you just go into like a nice little
cocktail party or whatever you just want
to have like a little bit of sexify
anise or just look like really cute I
think this looks really good like this
and as you look like I'm about to go off
right now so but I'm not I'm just
recording videos today but I really
think that this is nice I did use two of
my favorite sprays I've never introduced
it sprays you guys now this is a dry
shampoo spray my friend works for some
pastelon so she just brought them over
cuz she had that job we're giving them
up so it's a really nice job shampoo
what I noticed is that when I use this
it kind of solidified the curls a little
bit so they were a little bit more
defined and it also actually works as a
styling spray too like a hairspray so I
think that this is really good I will
link on this down below I'm not sure you
can get this from but this is good and I
usually use my technique arts while
styler
the next day hand which is my favorite
ones from L'Oreal I got this from Alta
and I will link this down below for you
guys if you're wearing synthetic units
and you want to get like some of that
shininess out these are the best
products to use on your synthetic units
it actually makes it look so much
natural and less shiny so that you look
really really good
and it'll look like you got a synthetic
was all about you I like some type of
human hair wig so yes so I hope you guys
are enjoying my wig Wednesday series
