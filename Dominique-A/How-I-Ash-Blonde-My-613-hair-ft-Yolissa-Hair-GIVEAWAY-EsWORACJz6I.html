today with another wig Wednesday video
so obviously I saw in the beginning I
kind of did another video where I showed
you guys how I die this hair now this
hair guys is from yo Leisha hair company
and I did a previous video from them so
I want to come back and do another video
we're using their hair so I got sent
four bundles of their 613 here and then
24 inches along with a 20 inch frontal
as well so I used all the hair for this
wig guys it's SuperDuper full now one
thing I want to mention to you guys
about 613 here is that when you get 613
here guys it's not gonna be like your
regular natural color bundles so when
you get 613 here it's a little bit
lighter and there's not that much hair
on the weft which I know this kind of
sounds weird me saying that it's kind of
like is it like thin or Shetty it's just
the way the hair is it's just come it
just comes to you like a little bit less
dense than your natural black hair would
now one thing I want to say about this
hair before I start guys is that I do
receive shedding from this here now I'm
not sure if it's just shedding from the
processing that they did for the 613 or
whatever or maybe it's because I did go
in and process it myself again but with
this hair you do receive shedding and
like I said on my videos so you receive
shedding with all hair so any type of
hair that you buy whether it's bundle
hair - wig or whatever it is you're
gonna get shedding so I'm not gonna say
here make it seem like oh this hair is
terrible terrible sheds I actually think
that this year is actually really nice
guys the way I constructed the wig was
perfect in the hair super flat on top
and the bundles are just perfectly
matched and even after calling this hair
guys I just feel like it looks so
freakin good at the same time the hair
is a body wave texture 6:13 but I do get
like a tinge of like an african-american
yaki texture to the wig when I did wash
it I ended up blow-drying it before it
before I put the curls in it and the
curls that do oh really like curls guys
I'm going to show you guys how to do
them just because there was no point in
me doing that but I did blow driving
here before I styled it and the blow-dry
the hair was like big and kind of like a
kinky texture so the hair does kind of
have like a slight yaki texture to it
which is kind of different for me I
didn't really think that 613 here could
be like that but I guess it is but yeah
so what I did do in the video is show
you guys to do the dark roots on the
around the perimeter in the parting
space I did the parting space twice so
there's one on the side and one in the
middle
just because I might want to switch up
my Styles other than that guys I asked
blonde and I like I usually deal with
the Revlon color silks and I will link
that down below for you guys alright
guys I will leave that information down
below if you're interested in purchasing
this hair from this company
I will also list down below all the hair
products that I used to achieve this
look I did use a mesh tone cap and I
used a blonde mesh dome cap and I also
used a blonde thread this time just
because I noticed that when I sewed the
hair on the cap the black cap it was
just kind of distracting and if you have
like a lot of gaps between your bundles
you're definitely going to see the cap
so I wanted to close this one seal it in
and make it look good
so I did use the blonde stocking cap and
blind thread so if you're doing like a
blonde wig definitely try to use those
instead of the black just because it'll
just make the whole entire unit look
clean and not messy now as far as
anything else with this wig guys I just
feel like it's a little bit frizzy but
all hair is frizzy and I do receive
shedding so those are the things that I
said to you already in the beginning but
hair sheds guys is really not that much
you can do to it
people say steal the weft steal the
wefts with something like back in the
day when wig games was just starting out
and poppin I don't even think anybody
steals a wife anymore because everyone's
just in the reality of things that hairs
gonna shed now is this something I want
to tell you to play with all day no I
would tell you just to wear it and
maintain it it's not a unit that I would
sleep in at nighttime I honestly will
put on my mannequin head style it on my
mannequin head the next one and get up
and put it on I did that in the last bit
on this one so I don't have to glue it
down but I did glue it on for this
purpose of this video but if you put an
elastic band on this bad boy you don't
have to glue it down you will be just
fine so other than that guys I do like
it now as far as the giveaway guys I
know you guys are kind of like antsy
about the giveaway so because I did
review you only should hear the first
time around it was straight here that I
review the first time and this is the
body wave texture I am going to giveaway
that unit now you guys were going
absolutely bananas but Nana's about that
unit so what I'm gonna do is give that
you know unit away to one of one of you
guys one of the winners now the way that
this is going to go you have to follow
me on instagram guys and you guys have
to like the picture that i post in
regards to this look as well as you have
to leave a comment down below it doesn't
have to be a specific comment it just
has to say something you know i don't

randomly select the winner for that
giveaway and I will announce the winner

was fair for me to give away the other
unit since I just created another one
from this hair company now if you do if
you are the winner if you want any unit
trim you guys make sure you post the
pictures on Instagram and make sure you
tag me in the pictures I just think
that's good I want to hear some positive
feedback and stuff like that from your
experience with me and if you did
purchase any wigs on my website my last
week so make sure you also post pictures
and tag me in it as well I know you guys
are constantly asking me about what am I
going to do another wig for wig sound
wig stills are more complicated than you
guys think I have like a run of an
experience with just bull with just BS
from people I'm doing the wig sale so
I'm trying to still notify plan so that
none of that stuff happens to me again
so once that plan gets solidified then I
will do another wig sale I have a whole
bunch of units so it's kind of like an
exclusive thing you're only gonna get
one of the units so you'd be the one
with it so once I kind of solidified
that plan I will come back and do that
wig so for you guys I know you guys keep
asking me ask me ask me and I'm not
ignoring your messages I get so many
dm's it's kind of hard to go through it
so um yeah so guys do not forget to
thumbs up this video
