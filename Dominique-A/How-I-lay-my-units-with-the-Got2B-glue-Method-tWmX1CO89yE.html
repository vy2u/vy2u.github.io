today to talk to you guys about how I
got my hair to lays down with the got to
be blue method so this is going to be
one of these kind of show you guys how I
did it videos and excuse me because in
some of these clips I like amassed
people I was late night and I just
wanted to kind of record this video
before I put the wig on my head the only
reason why this time I'm actually
wearing this a little bit longer is
because I really like the texture of the
hair this hair is from very hair calm
and this is the brazilian deep wave lace
front wig and I really like this hair
guys the texture is very nice guys and
it's very pretty at nighttime I just
basically twist the hair up together and
put a little bit of leaving conditioner
on it I don't put the leave-in
conditioner every night I just do it for
like maybe like Monday and then I'll
leave that like that and just wet it up
or whatever and just do like a light
spring on it just to keep it nice and
moist and then do twist if you want a
style video how I maintain this hair
just leave your comments down below but
let's talk about the got to be good so
I've never ever tried this method before
I know this methods been out for a while
and it just became recently popular
because people are saying how it's
really good for kind of laying your wigs
down I'm not a professional at this guy
I just tried this out just now just
because I wanted to see how I can get my
wig to lay down really nicely so
basically I laid it down around the
perimeter and I did have an elastic band
on this way if you watched my previous
video on this wig review I said that I
needed to add one so I did go in and add
that last band and then I basically got
the wig to stay down with the gotta be
doodle method and it's pretty flat
around the perimeter I did kind of do
this here more I did this out a little
bit more intricate and try to style this
set up a little bit more but the thing
about this is them I like where this
here or what they like I kind of like a
side flip over method nothing no parts
in it I just don't like the curly hair
with parts so I like it more so and it's
just kind of tilted towards one side and
because I glued it down and kind of put
the baby hairs out it looks a little bit
more nice and realistic looking
so the gotta do glue method is a good
method if you're trying to get that kind
of look I actually used a yellow one I
know people were saying that they have a
black version of the black bottle this
one they said that the black one wasn't
good so I decided to get the yellow one
and I've been trying the yellow one with
my wigs
I even tried it with mine
so here I'm with my shorter hair just to
get the kind of back to the back and the
sides to lay flat I'm with my styles and
this is really good what I'm gonna say
about this one is when you're using this
you have to make sure you basically
drive the layers out so if you're doing
like one thin layer first you need to
actually like blow dry it out or kind of
let it sit for like maybe five maybe
like a minute or so or 22 minutes and
then you add the second layer on and dry
that one off again and then you apply
the wig on top of it the next thing is
what I did instead of kind of using my
fingers I use a comb to kind of press in
the lace towards on the glue because
your hands are really oily sometimes so
therefore it'll kind of mix with the
glue and kind of prevent it from
sticking properly so I use a comb to
kind of get the hair to kind of jam in
there a little bit and get the glue to
actually stick to the lace so that's a
good thing
and when it comes to cutting your lace I
would say keep like a little bit of
extra lace on the wig just so therefore
you have a lot of grabbing space for the
glue instead of having to go directly on
the hair because you don't cut if you
cut too much lace off you'll have a
little bit of glue on your hair pieces
which is very annoying so when you're
cutting the lace on these units just
make sure you cut like leave like a
little little bit of lace left just so
you could get some extra extra
stickiness around the wig this was the
easy method method I'm not a
professional like I said guys so I just
tested this up for the first time and
watched a couple ladies on YouTube who
have been very helpful with their videos
so I decided to try it with this unit
like I said guys it's really good I
could do the high up and high-low thing
with this one I have a problem and we
just kind of stopped my baby here it's
up with this one and it will just come
out looking fabulous but like I said for
now I'm just kind of wearing out as like
a flip over kind of like a side look and
just tucking this behind or you can even
just do a straight to the side like this
and just do kind like a side thing and I
have my baby here it's cascaded out to
make it look a little bit more realistic
so that's basically it guys I hope this
video was informative didn't want to
make it a long video for you guys just
want to give you guys so kind of like a
talk through or how I slay or lay my
wigs whatever so I hope you guys saw on
this video very informative make sure
you leave all your comments down below
and thumbs up this video if you haven't
already
and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
