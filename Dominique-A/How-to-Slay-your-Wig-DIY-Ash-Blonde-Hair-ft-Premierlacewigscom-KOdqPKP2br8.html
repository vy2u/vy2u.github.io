I'm wearing a blonde hair today
this wig is actually from a company and
I've did a company review before for
this company I was not sent this here
for a review I bought the hair to color
and customized for myself and for you
guys this is from primarily swigs and
this is the Sierra wig and this is a
long version of the Sierra wig I will
link down below the exact link for this
hair this is a lace front wig and it's
22 inches and it's a glueless cap I did
customize it and I only purchased I do
purchase away from premier lace wigs
just because they're blondes are easy
for me to customize I have not tried any
other companies with Japanese
suggestions for any other companies
that's so good ombre blondie or platinum
blonde e'er leave those down below for
me so I customized this one just like
the shorter blonde bob wig I'll leave
the link down below for that video so
basically this is what the hair looks
like after I've customized it to the ash
blonde tone and this video will
basically show you guys the steps that I
did to actually get this ash color and
these subsidies for this video are the
exact same steps I used for the foncier
ombre bob platinum blog that I did
before so I have it a hair man alright
but yeah so those are the exact step
settings for this one there is no method
of me adding the color I'm just putting
the color on each bottle and then
saturating all together I know you guys
are questioning like how am I getting
the color to blend this well I just mix
all color together it's it sounds hard I
don't I don't know how to make it sound
easy for you guys to understand I just
mix all the colors together and then I
wait and then this is a color again it's
a very nice ashy blonde color it could
go for any type of skin colors African
American women
Coco woman like me hispanic caucasian
whatever it is if you're looking for a
really nice ash blonde tone kind of hair
using very inexpensive box hair dye then
keep watching this video make sure you
leave all your questions and comments
down below and also make sure you thumbs
up this video for more videos and I will
catch you guys later
guys this is what the wig looked like
when I first got the wig the wig was a
hot-ass mess it is too dark at the roots
and the blunt is way way way too light
so I definitely had to cut
this one I really like blonde and I
wanted to do something real cool the
party face on this is actually picking
guys so these are the box set data you
so I use too dark ash blonde boxes and I
use one medium a spline so you have one
number 70 and two number 60 you can get
these at Walmart for two thousand ninety
seven cents which is very very
affordable it does come with this
hydrating conditioner inside of it so
the hair does we dry out
well like I said guys to 60s and 172
dark ass one and one meeting ice one so
now I'm basically just showing you guys
a wig construction cap instruction if
you want to pick this whale up you can
pick it up all the way the link down
below the thing about this way though I
didn't have to add some platinum blonde
extensions from the beauty supply store
to it because it wasn't thick enough to
my liking but to each his own so and the
next one coming up a bit time to show
you guys of me mixing in the dye I
individual mix each and every value by
itself when I said in the beginning a
bit of that I'm just mix all the colors
together as you will see it I'm talking
about in the next clip I legitimately
just mix the colors together
there's no I didn't separate the hair
and guys this pieces color is a piece no
I legitimately did this the easiest way
possible and I achieved this look two
times in a row with this look and with
the blonde bob ombre into it so just
stay tuned and keep on walking
so basically in this clip I'm just
mixing all that hair dye in like I said
I'm going one by one with each of the
containers I don't have a method to my
madness I'm just simply applying the
colors all three colors to the blonde
track I know some people say that it's
hard to do this they don't know how I'm
getting the color well this is how I'm
getting the color I'm legitimately just
from the color everywhere and I'm just
saturating my hair with all three
bottles of hair dryers and like I said
before that's two number sixties and one
number seventy that's too dark a splines
in one medium as one so continue to
watch
but once on the color is basically
applied I'm basically just put a wrapper
here and let it sit for about 30 minutes
and after 30 minutes from here we will
kind of seemingly dark and almost it's
kinda like a purple ball instead of the
ash and basically XS women that are
oriented out conditioning and let it air
dry and these are the ending results
with the nice curls and style it doesn't
give any better than this guys this is
very simple
leave all your questions or comments
down below and continue to watch my
videos make sure you sooner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
