with another Kirby slash State girl
trying huh
so today's Sean Haugh guys is brought to
you guys from pawn shop now this is my
first time ever working with this
company so I'm really excited there are
very popular plus-size curvy girls / you
know thick girl Kuip of type of company
so I did pick all my items in size 1x
they start at 1x and go all the way up
to 3x they have a wide variety of very
very fashionable items so I got to pick
out a few items from the website and I
actually liked everything that I got now
in this video guys that did kind of
incorporate some of the items with like
other pieces to kind of make like full
outfit ideas not only do this because
some of the pieces I just felt more
comfortable putting something with it
just to kind of jazz it up a little bit
or try to make it more of my style
daaamn style so guys I will leave all
the information down below in regards to
all the pieces that were shown in this
video today and if you're interested in
seeing what I have to offer in today's
try and all guys I would like you to
stay tuned and keep on watch
alright guys so the first thing I'm
gonna show you guys is this really cute
two-piece set now this whole gold chain
styled two-piece thing it's really
really popular and when I saw to the
website it was kind of like so in love
so I had to get it so this one is the
size 1x and it's like the base of it is
black so it's a really cute kind of like
chain designed it kind of reminds me
like a Gucci design style outfit so that
one the top is kind of like what it'll
tie up front crop tops it's really cute
it's a nice material very soft it's
obviously polyester but it's like a
really nice soft material it also came
with these nice cute bell-bottoms now
the bell-bottoms are 1 X 2 the whole
entire set is a 1x now I definitely
could have got the bottoms a little bit
smaller and kept the top the size it was
but they don't offer an extra large they
only offer 1x - 3 X
but it will do guys honestly it's better
to be like a little bit more loose and
comfortable rather than being really
tight and like you know really
uncomfortable so I thought that this was
really nice guys it's like a wide leg it
goes all the way to the ground
definitely a nice piece to wear in the
summertime with some flat sandals and
you can definitely dress it up I kind of
wear like these really cute earrings
with it and I actually had this
hairstyle too so it's like a really nice
cold trendy style outfit I thought it
was absolutely Q on the website I was a
little fearful fearful fearful when I
selected it cuz I was like I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to
this look off I don't know if it's gonna
be the right theme for me just because
I'm kind of weird about stuff like that
sometimes I think it's gonna work and
sometimes it doesn't work and sometimes
it does work so I was kind of nervous
but I definitely think that this is
really cute it's definitely in trend for
this season right now and the fact that
it just have this like cool little chain
design and then put it and I love gold
jewelry so putting gold jewellery with
this just works perfectly it just
everything about it's like really nice
so when I received and I saw and I tried
and I was like this is going to be
excellent so I'm definitely to wear this
I think it's really cute just to wear
with your friends if you're going out or
something like that nothing major yeah
but I definitely like this so deaf you
looked this up guys because this one is
really cute and they have it all the way
up to size two reacts now the next thing
I got is this white jumpsuit now in the
beginning when I first got that when I
first tried on the jumpsuit I really
wasn't a fan of it and the reason why I
wasn't too much a fan of this jumpsuit
guys is because it was white and no I'm
not gonna say cuz it was white because I
picked it out white from the website I
wasn't a fan because I didn't anticipate
the material to be like this kind of
like half cotton and half polyester
material and if you're bigger well I'm
gonna say if you have big ass eyes like
I do like when you wear white pants you
can see all the crew other nooks and
cranny's the crevices in your thighs so
I'm really somebody that like hates that
look and even when I look in the mirror
I'm thinking to myself like if I had
layers on top of this you're not gonna
be able to see all the nooks and
crannies and stuff it's gonna come out
fine but for some reason I just feel
like everyone else can see like the
dents in my thighs with white so I kind
of get like really like scared to wear
so what I do with this outfit is I put a
jacket on to distract it so I'm usually
would not wear this guys honestly and
when I got it I was like really
discouraged because I was like you know
it's not gonna be nice so it's a halter
top jumpsuit which is different from me
because I don't like collar top so it's
a halter top jumpsuit and it has like a
nice zip in the back with the low-cut
I'm not gonna bring it up to light
because it'll wash me completely out but
you guys will see once it comes up on
the screen so I has a halter top and it
has like a low back not too low like the
perfect low leg right above your back
fat below your back fat and it also it's
like kind of like an ankle style pant
it's not too uh what is it called wide
leg or kind of like boxy so
definitely kind of like a nice skinny
leg and it's really cute when I put it
together with the yellowjacket now the
yellow Jack and I feature kind of I
think was last week of the week before
and it's worms at full I love the whole
entire concept its concept together and
I'm kind of it kind of feels like I'm
pushing into the colors of the spring
and summer but for some reason the
yellow jumpsuit with the yellow the
white jumpsuit with the yellow jacket
just was looking so cute to me so when I
combined the outfit together I was like
you know I actually like the jumpsuit
more so this is one of those things like
if you buy something and it doesn't seem
like it's gonna be a good outfit you got
to kind of work your way through it
because like if the outfit itself is not
cute if you add accessories on top of it
sometimes the accessories could
definitely bring the outfit to another
level so this one definitely took me to
another level I just love the whole
concept of the layered chains that I had
on the jumpsuit in the jacket and even
if I put like some nice kind of like
brown heels along with it it would be
like really cute very simple hair very
simple kind of makeup style and it was
just like fabulous to me so I definitely
had I was really worried about this in
the beginning but once I put the outfit
on and then tried to do different things
with the outfit I definitely liked it
even even even more than I did in the
beginning so definitely check these
jumpsuit on I think that these came in
two other colors as well too so if
you're interested in this definitely
check the company out for this one
because I kind of feel like if you put
like layers on top of it or kind of
style it up it definitely would throw
off the white appearance and kind of all
the distraction of like the crater eat
cottage cheese thighs and stuff like
that which I hate and I definitely had
that issue so I'm always worried about
wearing white but this time it worked
out perfectly alright guys so the next
two pieces are I'm gonna show you guys I
really like as well too like I said I
think I actually liked everything from
this website I'm not gonna lie so I'm
not gonna keep repeating these are the
ones that I like these are the ones I
like because I liked everything so the
next thing I'm gonna show you guys is a
cute black jumpsuit now I always get
jumpsuits but I have to have particular
style jumpsuits now this one was really
cute and elegant so I thought I can kind
of like style it up and make it Dom
style so it is black and black to me
sometimes can be boring but black can
also be really sexy at the same time too
so this one is cute guys is the size 1x
and it has a nice deep v in it so what I
have to do cuz I told you guys I'm
someone that does not like that really
deep plunge line like I have a shorter
torso so might the plunge life for me
goes all the way down to my bellybutton
and I'm just not gonna wear it stuff
like that so I did close it up just a
little bit guys but I didn't close it
all the way up so that I can have like a
little bit of cleavage area so it is
really cute guys and when I tell you
guys that close it up I just basically
sold the inside of it up so that it kind
of seals the kind of low low deep V and
I when I do my fashion over China hauls
I also mentioned that in those two
before I even try the clothes on I make
sure I fix the clothes off to the
clothes before I try it on and I explain
to you guys what I've done so this one I
did kind of have to seal up the the
breast area a little bit just because
the plunge line was way too far out my
torso is not a long torso so therefore
it doesn't need to be all the way down
to my bellybutton if you know what I
mean so I did close this one up but it's
like a nice deep V it does have kind of
like a little bit of a ruching area
right here in the front and it is a very
nice long pant leg it's kind of like a
bell bottom style I am 5'4 and 1/2
inches tall so these usually come like
really long for me so I usually tend to
wear these types of jumpsuits with like
heels or something like that so that can
get like a little bit of elevation but
if I don't feel like wearing heels I'll
probably just really like a flats and
don't kind of have like a nice bell
bottom style look and kind of sometimes
that is better cuz if you don't want to
wear heels sometimes you want to let go
out you're gonna swear flat sandals
because the pants are so long you want
to be able to see your shoe so I always
get away with that one as well so I
thought that this was really cute guys I
did add on that really cute custom that
really cute double belted belt that I
got from zeph flow on top of it and I
just felt like that adding that on just
kind of elevated the look a little bit
and I really really liked it once I put
the belt on so I was totally totally
totally feeling this outfit guys it was
just everything about it was cute I love
gold accessories and the gold
accessories that I added to this one
just made the black look much better so
definitely if you have a belt or if
you're someone that has that kind of
playing office and don't have anything
to put with outfit and kind of feel out
the Alpha is a little bit flat
definitely go in at accessories like
hats belts kind of like stuff like that
corsets and stuff like that I honestly
feel like when I add pieces on top of it
it just makes the outfit so much better
so I definitely really really like this
outfit like there's gonna be so many
events coming up that I need outfits for
so I definitely have a few outfits lined
up already from this company so I'm
definitely definitely really pleased so
far now the next thing I got in this
kind of Rouge dress now this dress for
me is I kind of compare this to the ones
from fashion OVA but this one's a little
bit different just because this one is a
better material this one has a thick
material that's more secure and more
comfortable so if you're someone that
just likes to be nice and comfortable
and doesn't want like really too much
suckage and stuff like that I did get a
fashion of a dress that was similar to
this one that was in extra-large and for
some reason I thought that dress was
suffocating the hell out of me this one
is a size 1x guys it's a color red and
it has like a tan inside now I really
really like this dress a lot guys just
because it's really sexy and February is
coming Valentine's Day is coming so I
definitely want to pick some outfits out
some dresses and stuff out that kind of
matched the season and match the time so
this one's really cute guys it's a nice
ruched type of style dress it is it for
me it comes um it comes past the knee
cap like I said I'm pretty short so my
dress has never hit the way other like
the models on the website do because
they're like five seven five nine ish
whatever it is so this one goes right up
on below my knees I think it's really
cute guys it's not too too sexy I think
the part where they add a sex appeal is
kind of having 210 underneath just to
make it look like it's a body figure
instead of it being like an actual slip
but it's really cute guys I do feel like
it's just a little bit big but I can
work with it if I put in the drought
under the dryer I'm pretty sure to kind
of shrink out a little few sizes but I
thought this was really cute guys I just
kind of had like this a vision of a nice
Valentine's Day dinner wearing a really
simple dress and just looking really
nice nothing crazy and I don't even know
if I'm celebrating Valentine's Day this
year just because not even celebrating
it I'm just not gonna do a lot of stuff
because I have a long line of
Valentine's Day trip I guess I can say
so it's that's it's just kind of like
there's really no point to get out crazy
everyone's gonna over book that day and
you're not gonna be able to enjoy it the
way you want to with your significant
other so I'm just gonna keep it real
low-key that day and just do a little
bit of stuff and then if the weekend
comes up and there's a movie that comes
up and I think Pink Panther comes out
that weekend or the week
after I probably just go see that movie
and call it a week because it's just
turn Valentine's Day so commercial and
it turns into such a big ordeal but for
those of you out there that want like a
Valentine's Day lookbook or something
like that or kind of ideas outfit ideas
just leave your comment down below and I
will give you guys that video soon so
yeah but I do like the dress guys and
they do have its in other colors so if
you're looking for other colors for
other outfit ideas or other occasions
stuff like that definitely check out the
website I will leave the link down below
so the next two things I got are more
jumpsuits so I got two more jumps it's
from the website honestly they had a lot
of stuff but the jumpsuits were calling
me guys it really was calling me so the
next one that I got is really cute now
this is actually different it's not
really all the sound kind of like really
have jumps you jump suit so this one is
basically like an overall set now this
isn't over all that develop it though so
velvet is definitely popular you guys
know I've been killing the velvet game
like I think in every single video that
I've reviewed of this season and maybe
like in December as well too well this
season has been velvet there's been like
at least one or two velvet pieces in my
trying hauls but I can't get off the
velvet velvet to me is just so cool and
like I'm the type of person that mixes
velvet with a lot of different textures
like I will wear velvet with a plaid
shirt applied long t-shirt like I'm just
weird I just like velvet a lot I think
that's texture is really nice it's
almost like a nice girly type of texture
and if you want to mix that grudge
patterns what they are kind of like
denim patterns within stuff like that I
just think it looks so cute so that's
what I'm like so stuck on it and that's
why I keep on reviewing this type of
material so this one right here is cute
it's a nice crushed velvet is this like
a berry color so it's basically an
overall set it actually fit really nice
guys like it what's fitting really nice
now this is the type of stat guys I
actually would wear casual instead of
wearing it kind of like dress-up type so
casual meaning I would actually wear
this with sneakers I don't know
something about this was really really
cute to me and I know it's kind of like
why would you wear that with sneakers
well like I said DOM style so I would
wear this with sneakers guys it was
really cute it has it kind of Criss
crosses in the back and it goes about to
your ankles and it is the type of ankle
that's kind of like a tight ankle
and even if it isn't technical you can
just cop it up a little bit just to give
it more like up like a cool vibe so what
I would do with this one is cuff the
ankles up and wear some low top converse
sneakers with a white t-shirt underneath
girl or even wear a black t-shirt and
then put a let Jean Jack and distress
jean jacket on top of it wait a minute
what now that would be a cute outfit I
don't think I would wear this here I
probably you know me switching on my
wings all the time
I probably our nice the middle part
jet-black wig with like a baseball cap
or maybe like a baseball cap to the back
oh girl you see what I'm saying like
these ideas like flow dramatic like it
kind of seems like sometimes like I
don't dress up all the time because I'm
either in scrubs I'm either at home
working from home and working like at my
job or stuff like that but when I get
the opportunity to actually wear clothes
and stuff at that yogurt I put my
outfits together guys I don't be just
coming on here putting these pieces
together and you guys like oh she just
does that right now she doesn't know I
honestly like go out of my way to look
now go out of my way to look nice I kind
of think about my outfits like I
definitely am NOT gonna lie I switch my
hair with all my outfits I actually have
to look at my wigs before I pick out an
outfit I my hair and my hair revolves
around my look like and I know that
sounds crazy and some people are like
why is she like so upset it's not that
I'm obsessed it's just kind of like
every wig has a mood or like every
morning you wake up you have a mood it's
kind of like saying oh you're dating
someone he's dating like five different
people when I wear different when he's
my boyfriend's dating somebody else okay
like I got I'm like Becky that that day
and the next day I'm like you know Dom
it's just that's just how I am so every
single day like I'm picking out an
outfit I have to find a way to wear
especially the wig is not glued on my
head you damn right I'm gonna go look
for another way to wear and then my wig
has to match the entire look so for this
outfit let me get back to stop be quiet
so like I said I'm the tire person that
will pick out a certain type of weight
for each outfit it's just something that
I do I kind of feel like my hair has to
match my outfit or I have to make it
work or I'll find a way to manipulate it
so that the hair and off it go well
together so like I said guys I really
like this one it fits really nice and
the way I would wear this was it would
be casual I wear I would wear this with
sneakers I
think wearing this with sneakers would
be so effing cute guys
it was just given more like a cute and
athletic vibe so that combination
together with like a plain t-shirt
underneath and like my little chant go
chain necklace and like either a
distressed jacket or leather jacket on
top would just be so freakin cute and
you know what guys I am gonna try to do
some lookbook so I'm gonna try to do
like special kind of like like outfit
idea type of videos if you guys want to
see outfit ideas like that leave your
comments down below but I definitely
thought this was really cute guys and if
you want to get something like this they
had another one that was kind of like a
leopard print which was actually cute as
well too but my heart was for the
crushed velvet so I went straight to the
crest I even I look past other one I
went straight to it guys like that's how
crazy I am about crushed velvet so this
is really cute guys it's a size 1x and
it looks fab now you know I cannot do a
try and haul without like some type of
gene material so this one is a jean
jumpsuit like a Jean material jumpsuit
now with this one guys I I'm not gonna
lie I really like this one now when I
first got it I kind of was fearful that
it wasn't gonna fit the right way so
with this one it did have kind of like
one of those low deep cuts as well and
I'm just I just don't like that so what
I did with this one is just sew it in
just so it a little bit of up just to
close it and like I said I tell you guys
all the time when I do that just because
I don't um like I gotta fix myself
before I put it on especially when i
come on here and try to show you guys
stuff I got to be correct so this one is
really nice guys it's kind of like a
nice v-neck jumpsuit now the belt that I
have on in the video with it is I didn't
come with the belt so I did add on a
little accessory belt on it just because
I wanted to kind of give you guys a feel
of how I would personally wear it if I
find something that actually if I find
like a outfit or like a jumpsuit that
actually has a design belt like they
created their own kind of like cinched
in waist line by making like a little
fold in the the waist area what I
usually like to do is put a belt on it
because they're basically emphasizing
the fact that they want there to be some
type of accentuation in that area so
I'll put a belt on that Aaron just to
kind of gather in the look I think that
this jumpsuit is really nice guys it
definitely fits the physique
very very nice and it looks really good
this type of material is not a cheap
miss here at all guys it's actually
pretty heavy pretty
nice dance material the pant leg is
really nice it goes all the way straight
leg it's a really nice pant leg I would
recommend wearing some type of booties
or like some heels with this one and
with just give it more like an upscale
classic look I would not wear sneakers
with this just because for some reason
the way it's constructed it's
constructed so kind of like it's
constructed so nice and kind of its it
kind of is a perfect jean jumpsuit for
heels or some type of like nice wedge or
something like that you know what I mean
the material the way you look if you
look at the way the material is it's
meant for like heels or wedges and I
just thought it was really cute guys so
I definitely would recommend picking
this one out too I'm a Jean junkie I
were you and like this is another one
and all my China hauls recently I've
been showing you guys kinda like Jean
dresses or Jean jumps it's just jeans
something I just love it I love the
material against my skintone
african-american sick skintone it just
looks really good and I love putting a
nice kind of like brown mahogany or
khaki style bow on just because the Jean
against that tone just looks really good
and yeah so you guys have seen kind of
repeats of things but I think from this
website I got some really solid pieces
though like pieces that I can actually
develop and that's really important so
when you're shopping for some stuff make
sure that you could find pieces that you
can actually wear different types of
ways instead of wearing it one way and
when I pick all my stuff from a lot of
websites I like to pick up stuff that I
know I could wear differently like I
don't have to wear one way I can wear
like several different ways so that's
one thing to keep in mind when shopping
on an any website so the last piece that
I'm gonna show you guys which is one of
my favorite pieces so I wanted to save
it for last so when I went on the
website I was looking through I kind of
looked through their bottoms and their
bottoms had like a skirt section so I
went to the skirt section I do like body
con skirts and I I don't notice I don't
know if you guys know that I really
don't wear body con skirts like that I
just kind of feel like body con skirts
are kind of boring in a way it's just
kind of like you're the only way you're
gonna wear a body scott if you're
wearing a body con skirt it's basically
like you're wearing a dress so you might
as well just go off and purchase alright
guys so the last item got to show you
guys it's probably one of my favorite
items so i wanted to wait last to show
you guys it's item just
cuz it's really cute now I was going
through their sections and I went to the
bottom section in the bottom section had
skirts in it obviously because a skirt
is a bottom piece hmm yeah so I found
this really cute skirt and they had a
few other ones I believe that a few
other ones but this is basically one of
those types of african skirts that they
had now I have never ever had an african
scared before but I've had like that
shiki's before but this does not compare
this is like the pinnacle of all types
of stuff now I've always wanted a skirt
like this but any other website I looked
at they were really really expensive
this website has them for a very
affordable price so I definitely was
like yes when I saw it so I really
always had like these ideas with these
types of skirts they're really really
nice very Afrocentric and just kind of
like something that I would really like
to wear like expressive us going to is
like a baby shower or like a wedding or
like some type of event that was a nice
formal kind of kind of a casual / formal
event I think that this one would look
really nice now I did pair this off with
the top that's probably not the type
that you would work like an event like
that but if I was going to like some
kind of like you know like little nutsy
after a concert or something I wanted to
wear this with that top I think it would
look nice now if you guys have noticed
already in this video I've already
showed you guys with my boobs look like
if you do not know and it's almost
towards the end of the video I did get a
breast augmentation revision so I went
from 350 CCS and I am now at a 650 CC
and I'm exactly one week post-op seeing
that you're well yeah when we oh my god
I am one week post-op today so if you're
looking at me like why are her boobs
look so big I got new boobs guys so um
that's why and they are looking a 1 so
it's only been a week 2 but because I
had the surgery prior it's kind of like
my body so used to so my my body
basically swelled the implants and just
kind of like settled I'm still healing I
still have to wear the bra and all that
kind of stuff so I just I just quickly
try these on and like I wasn't holding
my babies like together because I really
want to make sure I do the proper
healing process and stuff like that so
they can just be perfect towards the end
like right at the end when I'm done
wearing this stupid bra but they you
guys saw them this time
that's the first hello guys say hi to
them yeah it's been exactly weeks since
I got them so I just want to mention
that because I know once you guys see
this you guys and blood Wow her boobs
got bigger
yeah they got bigger but I actually
think I did I think I made a good choice
like I was so worried about the size I
was supposed to 715 if I got 750 I
wouldn't look ridiculous so I'm happy
that I got the 615 750 they look
bomb.com summertime killa so um yeah
that's beside that so this skirt guys I
thought it was so cute with the top like
that maybe like a white top or something
that as my bag I almost put a black top
but I think like a black top with a room
ended the white top goes so perfect this
skirt is so cute guys it's like a nice
vibrant yellow skirt it has blue green
designs on it one thing about this guy I
want to mention to you guys it's super
super big on the bottom when I mean big
it's like a puffer skirt so what I'm
going to do because I dearly love this
skirt so much I just feel so many vibes
from it like I feel so so cultured with
it it was that bad if I know something
with a book I could say like I feel so
cultured with this skirt on guys so what
I'm probably gonna do is take this earth
to get hem so that they can make it a
little bit shorter just because not
shorter like yeah make a little bit
shorter just because it like drags on
the floor and I definitely which like
trip on this and bust my lip so I want
to get it shortened so I can wear it to
like a plenty of places this summer many
outdoor concerts stuff like that maybe I
haven't take it to me when I go with me
into New Orleans you know you don't know
so I definitely really like it it's very
afro so I feel the vibe my eighty-three
percent African heritage you know it's
funny I did what is it called
um ancestry I'm eighty-three percent
African and seventeen percent European
so I feel my eighty-three percent
African guy so I don't know when I wear
this skirt I was feeling like I was
feeling like all types of ways in the
skirt so I definitely recommend you guys
check this out it is one size fits all
guys and it's kind of weird because well
I can see why I'd be one size fits all
so it's one size fit all it's very very
at the waistband it does come with a
belt so if it is too big when you first
slip it on all you gotta do is take the
belt tighten it up and you are perfect
