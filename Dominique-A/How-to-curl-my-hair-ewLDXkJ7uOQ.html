a quick review on how I curl my hair now
I achieve this look and I'm just gonna
simply show you guys how I style my hair
when I'm going out or for my everyday
look if I want to wear curls and this is
the achievable look I'm just gonna show
you guys certain sections and how I
actually curl the sections of my hair I
do also use a hair straightener at times
but this time I just simply use the hair
straight hair curler and at nighttime if
I really want to cross to stay on flexi
rather ends I'll twist them like this
and I'll flexi rather hair and um
basically that's about it so I'm gonna
start off by showing you guys my hair
curler and this is really old so don't
judge me this is from Bed Head
and it's TIG I here curler I'm not sure
how many inches this is I got this is a
really old house for like a really long
time but this is really good and it
heats up pretty well um you turn it on
like this and you can see the light go
up you got to hold it down to turn it
off then you got to hold it down to turn
it on and it's on right right now which
is a high setting and it's really hot
you could go you see how I push it
downwards and it goes to the lowest
setting which is um like yellow and in
the middle right there and you go and
that's actually right here which is not
that which is actually okay yep and this
just basically the blue part basically
tells you that it's on and off so how I
curl my hair tight so right now I have
like bangs so my bangs go this way and I
know people have different ways of
styling their curls but what I do is I
usually like section my hair off and I
usually tough these behind my ear and I
have this piece right here which is kind
of like my bang part and what I like to
do is I need to take this piece right
here and like to roll this like this if
I had a hair pin one second
okay guys and what they hairpin oh you
should just put this up right here and
then I would start calling the hair so
when I curly hair curly hair going back
this this is my right hand side so I
curl these pieces going back this way so
you'll take it like this you'd roll it
all the way up
I usually with tail hanging at the end
you clamp don't put any hairspray or
anything I actually already sprayed some
heat protectant on my hair before and I
will show you guys what the heat
protectant looks like take this like
this yeah there's a curl and then I
would do that one all the way around
show you what curling the back of the
hair looks like for the back of my hair
I don't curl from the root up I'd curl
it that's just like right about here cuz
that's where I want the curl of e what
I'm gonna do is curl the back piece and
show you guys my site the back piece I
just roll it all the way up and hold
your friend me like this because I want
the curl to drop down so I feel like if
I hold it like this Tacoma like kind of
flop down better so that's how I always
do it just see how hot it's really hot
to it so gotta be careful now you see
that one that girl came out good too
okay and then this right here is a
little bit shorter because I later this
part off as you can see so this part
when you curl this one and automatically
flip backwards so I usually just curl
this a piece like this and I curl it all
the way as far as high as I can to the
tip I usually leave that part on for a
while cuz that's where the winged effect
comes in so you want to make sure that
the bang and the wind on this side where
the bangs out at is like really nice and
windy windy so I actually leave that
in it do a couple pumps and this was one
on this piece will automatically just
fly backwards like that so now I'm gonna
take my bang down and what I'm gonna do
it today is a stranger club with my
hands and your because I that the bank
is going this way I also curl it the
backwards way not the forward way
because it doesn't look that you know
right to me that's how you come in so
that bumping like this on the top man is
awkward right guys so I just pump this
one like this you can see that but
Carla's like big and then now what I
gotta do is bring everything to the
front and then just finger comb comb
these paths like that and make sure that
it's nice um this hair is not virgin
hair or any type of expensive hair this
is Janna Herron sensational - natural
yaki here so this hair is very
inexpensive but you can find this at any
beauty supply store so basically the
hair the curls on this type of texture
here in the African American Texan area
they're very yaki cut in here
it pretty much last with this type of
them um drunk I mean beauty supply store
here so I don't really have to do
anything it'll drop later but the drop
looks really cute with any type of here
you buy that synthetic though guys don't
get that messed up
so um want to play with it a little just
mess around a little bit with it
okay and once you feel like that's
pretty much it
um then you're all set I don't put your
hairspray on I'll put anything like that
in it because I feel like hairspray
makes the hair look less natural looking
and it kind of makes it more dense and
weighs it down so that's what it looks
like show you the back view and I'm very
happy and pleased so this is a lot guys
if you guys have any questions or want
to see what my makeup looks like I mean
when I'm wearing on my face today you
guys just leave a message down below and
I'll be more than likely to give you a
hit back ok guys so thank you very much
and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
