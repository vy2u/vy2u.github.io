alright guys so this is the finished
look of the unit now I'm someone that's
really not too crazy when it comes to
that kinky kinky straight hair you guys
and I love a Yaqui straight hair but
this one is SuperDuper kinky
so with this unit guys you really have
to put some work in it I didn't want to
come to you guys with the just away came
out the pack so I did run the straighten
it through some of the front parts of
this here just lightly and I did some of
the back I only did it did a little bit
of straightening just because I like how
um I kind of like buff it is and I'll
kind of fluffy it looks and I didn't
want to kind of over strain it so then
it'll be a nice kind of like thin
looking and not so puffy I do like this
kind of natural look this is a 360 wig
guys so you get about four inches of
parting space in the front and about two
in the back I just did a side part with
this one like I usually do and just play
with the baby hairs a little bit I did
have to go in and tweeze this a little
bit it did come pre tweeze but I wanted
to pull some more hair off just because
this is super thick guys so I wanted to
kind of really make it look like it was
coming from my head it is a type of here
guys that you're not really gonna be
able to do a like really deep baby hair
magic with just because the texture and
the kink on it is definitely one of
those that's really definitive and
anyways when you're wearing texture here
like this anyways you really want to
mimic it as natural as possible so I
would say like you can slicked down the
baby hairs like a little bit and then
just kind of leave it with this natural
kink I actually thought that this you
know was made pretty well guys it fit
ear to ear and like I always say my
videos I'm about at 21.5 222
circumference so that's how my head is
although I do go in and adjust the
straps just to make them tight that's
the head size shape of the cap and I
always use just because it's like right
in the middle and it's either gonna be
big or small it's just gonna fit perfect
so I usually get 221 21.5 / 22 so that
one is what I use now I really like this
guys like I said I'm not really someone
that's a big fan of this type of texture
just because it is very very buff and it
could be very heavy I did do a review
one time with some hair from a company
that was like this and I did curl wands
in it and the curl was actually
pretty like they actually wear it looks
really good so I might even try to do
that with this one but I'm trying to I'm
kind of feeling that kind of like you
know flip over method kind of like let
it all free type of style I think that
it looks better like that and it just
looks like real effortless and like it
looks it looks actually like it could be
my real hair honestly and truly so I
feel like that I hope you guys like this
I'll leave the information down below I
believe this one is about 20 inches long
but I just snip the ends a little bit
just because I felt that the ends were
like a little bit straggly it's not as
thick at the ends as it is in the front
or in the roots so that's one thing
you're gonna kind of see when you get
the unit but if you kind of like shape
it up a little bit you know add like a
little bump at the ends of the unit I
think you'll be perfectly fine if you
really want to switch up and want to
kind of wear something that's very
natural looking guys I think that this
unit is definitely perfect for that I
actually like how the hair line is and
how it fits ear to ear with no issues I
glue this one down guys so it's pretty
much secured on my head and it looks
really good so guys as usual I'll leave
everything down below if you're
interested in purchasing this baby guys
and this unit is reform gr here calm now

friends and family people and I will
catch you guys in the later one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
