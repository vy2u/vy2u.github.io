by Ron we calm so I will link all the
items down below if you're interested in
purchasing anything from this website so
in this description bar as well I will
also link the units that I'm showing you
guys as well so I do like to switch my
hair up a lot when I try an office
because I really want to be in the mood
and kind of like in the moment as if I
was really stepping out the house so
linked on in chronological order all the
wigs that I featured in this video so
I'll link the direct link to that video
down below so if you want to see that
wig see how I style this yeah I slayed
it you can just click the link down
below and to watch that video so guys
the format of this video in the style
this video is going to be the same as
the last video so if you did not see
that video I'll leave the link up here
for you guys just click that a lot of
you guys liked the way I did that video
so I'm gonna do the same style this time
and I'm just gonna add a couple of words
in because I do want to explain some
stuff on this website that was a little
bit tricky a lot of this stuff I did get
from the plus-size section and some of
the stuff for like hits or misses so I
want to explain to you guys why they
didn't did they didn't work but I did
put them on in the video anyways to show
you guys how I incorporated so you kind
of don't really see where the mistake is
at so yeah so I did call it's kind of
like a pre spring haul just because I'm
going away I'm going to New Orleans in
two weeks and then I'm going to tile in
in three weeks so I wanted to kind of
get some stuff that were kind of like
spring inspired by the time I get to
Thailand I'd be there they're kind of
pre summer so it's gonna be extremely
hot so I did pick out like some short
little sets like a romper and stuff like
that so I hope that you know you guys
think it kind of ideas if you're going
on vacation I'm traveling a lot this
year so I'm gonna do a lot of packing
videos and kind of like how I pack my
units videos pack my makeup pack my
clothes and the outfit ideas and choices
that I get if you do follow me on
Instagram you guys will see a lot of
posts this year and a lot of fun things
as well too but for the purposes of this
video I do call it like a pre spring
haul just because a lot of the stuff I
picked are more so in the spring vibe so
it's February anyways by the time marts
comes into April is gonna start getting
a little warm so here's the beginning of
the end
just joking so guys if you're interested
in seeing what I have to offer in
today's try on haul guys
I would like you to stay tuned in
one thing I encounter with this romper
though guys a little bit tight and just
giving the arms in general the top part
in general bond is really hard the
bottom is very stretchy fitchburg
perfectly fine I actually like this with
a hat but the color combination is
definitely something I'm definitely
don't have to wear what are going to
tire
so the next series of like tops now I
really like this top it's very sexy I
think it goes forward front this is the
front I tried the back way and it didn't
make sense so I really like this outfit
definitely reminds me of Selena those
vibes are definite poppin right now so I
definitely this outfit a lot and you
guys will see a couple more tabs that I
just absolutely adore
so I'm continue with more time so this
is a body suit so a lot of the ones
you've seen our body suits the only one
that wasn't a body suit was a clear
see-through top now this is a body suit
that I wish actually wear as a bathing
suit but unfortunately it's thong style
and it's like really g-string thong so
and it just will be so inappropriate but
I really love the back and they have a
lot of back fat but this one just looks
so frickin good
I feel like this string landed perfectly
where my back fat is that so it kind of
conceals it a little bit it just gives
it this really like amazing sex appeal
like I just I love this this one piece
is amazing with jeans I paired it with
these kind of like squishing Palazzo
type bell-bottoms stop pants I'm
definitely over to Thailand it's very
hot there and it's gonna look so sexy
mostly the top this is just way too so I
think I've gotten size 1x they didn't
have an in cero accident which owner
garden 0 actually because the one is too
big for me but it definitely looks like
a beach attire it definitely goes good
with the bikini and you know just be
really nice to her on the beach and yeah
guys here's a reveal where my boobs look
like with a bikini on I just love them
I'm just so happy that I went through
with the revision like you guys I've
never seen so many babies at all it's
just gonna be lit this year
like the red color with the lace trim
and I don't know I liked it with this
hair too I just thought this table was
really nice and professional if you're
looking for some work retired the next
is this time and the next table are deaf
people Turkish work attire tops very
nice I just so much
so I still wouldn't care I thought it
was cute doing the whole head scarf the
pop of earrings and another shirt this
shirt is actually for Robins lovely you
can find that they have a whole bunch of
colors I kind of killed those tops last
year and surprisingly these ones still
fit me even after my procedure I really
like this off with the vibe is really
cool I can't wait to find somewhere to
go to kind of wear like something like
this I think this is definitely
something for spring and summer
transition it's just really cute
so that basically wraps up this video I
hope you guys really enjoy this video I
kind of worked really hard on it like I
always do I don't think people
understand how hard it is to actually
edit videos it's like a complete cycle
almost a long day process especially
when it comes to the Tron hauls because
you're really trying to perfect the
flood the clips and stuff like that it
just gets really crazy but I'm trying to
improve the game trying to improve my
style of videos for you guys so if you
