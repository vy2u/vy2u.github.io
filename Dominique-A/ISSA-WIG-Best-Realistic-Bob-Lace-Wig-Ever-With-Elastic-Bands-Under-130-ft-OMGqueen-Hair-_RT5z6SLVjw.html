today for another wig Wednesday video so
this unit that I'm sporting today guys
is from oMG clean hair calm so this unit
right here guys it's kind of like a lob
stalled unit so basically it's shorter
in the back right here and then you get
a nice bit of length in the front guys
please tell me this wig is not popping
now first of all the best thing about
this unit to me guys is that the texture
is a Yacky texture
I love a Yaqui textured unit when you
strain the unit out it looks beautiful
and then when you co wash the unit into
an wash unit after it keeps a great life
but it gets better and better every time
I am an avid lover of you I can touch it
here it just has more of a body as more
of a vibe it definitely has a great
style great texture when you kerley it
looks gorgeous so when I saw that this
unit was actually a Yaqui texture I was
hype now like what kind of say the
length is kind of like dimensional so
it's kind of like 2 or 3 different types
of lengths so in the firming outs it's
probably like a 12 or 14 inch in the
front and then the back is about like a
10 kind of dipping into the 12 and then
a 14 we'll go with that one so I
definitely did an excellent job as far
as cutting the unit I didn't do anything
what I mean anything to is you and I did
nothing to this unit all I did to this
unit was a fixer adjustable strap and
just pop it on my head and put some
powder on it and then kind of flatten
the top out now with this one these
units they do actually add an elastic
band for you on it so the only issue I
had with that one was that the last pin
was too big so I'm kind of thinking to
myself like how's that gonna work out
for everyone so all I did was cut a part
of the elastic band off and restore it
down to make it fit in my head they just
kind of put their band on there and if
they kind of have to kind of figure out
whether to either measure the heads or
kind of make it go along with the
elastic band on the head on the wig cap
itself but that's the manufacturers
issue nut mines but all I did was just
cut the lasted van a little bit and then
just resew it down to kind of make it
fit my head so definite fits better now
I definitely think it's nice that they
added it on instead of having throwing
it in the box and then having us to
because that's not gonna extra stuff
that everyone doesn't know how to do and
everyone doesn't have time to do so I
thank them for that because that
definitely can help so guys
other than that I really don't have
anything negative to say about this unit
I didn't get any shedding tingling or
any of that kind of mass the hair is
really nice and I definitely think that
this is a holiday wig a christmas wig a
new you New Year's New Year's wig I
would definitely say put a little put
the strainer through it a little bit get
it kind of nice and flat it definitely
has a lot of it a lot of that flyaway
which is annoying I have so I definitely
have to go in and press the flyaways
down continuously to kind of get it to
calm that down but I definitely think it
looks nice it's very sleek very edgy
elegant and it just kind of goes with
the home attire look like a girl so I
definitely turn around and show you guys
with the unit looks like 360 so you guys
can see exactly what it looks like now
guys do not forget to thumbs up this
video leave your comments down below
subscribe and share this video with your
friends and family people and don't
forget I will leave all the information
down below for you guys if you guys are
interested in this baby I do think they
have a Black Friday so that's continuing
so maybe you get this unit just in time
and I will catch you guys in a later one
