Street guys now this hair is a natural
wave here guys it's 24 inches long and
it's a medium cap size it is a medium
medium brown color lace and guys it is a
hundred eighty percent density and full
of wave now I reviewed a wig for this
company probably like a few months ago
and the hair that I reviewed for them
was similar to this pattern but it was
more like a kind of like a wet and wavy
style and that one was two hundred
percent density guys and that two
hundred percent density was like spot-on
it was SuperDuper thick and I actually
think I'm actually putting that wig on

hairline looks like guys it's super
super nice guys and with this you know
one thing I want to point out to you

being an issue for me and it's an issue
for a lot of people I've heard from a
lot of people that you guys have the
same issue air tab on this unit Falls
perfectly now if you have a medium sized
head small head large head whatever it
is

fits ear to ear right here I glued it on
