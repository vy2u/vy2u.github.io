review now this hair review is brought
to you guys from Aliexpress based
company and this company is the modern
show hair I've had this hair for a while
I just haven't had a chance to upload
the video for the hair review as you
guys can see on my last video you guys
commented someone commented and asked me
what kind of hand this was so this is
the Peruvian loose wave hair I have four
bundles that I have two 22 inch bundles
one 20 inch bundle and an 18 inch bundle
as well as a 6 inch closure and so I
have to read this from my phone because
I don't quite remember what the specs
were for this hair I was supposed to
pull this a while ago but it took me a
while because I had a lot of things to
do um
pretending to the summer time I was
working and stuff like that I won't
answer some clips into the video show
you guys what the hair look like when I
first got it I just recently started
wearing it one thing I would say that
this is the natural state of the hair I
have not straightened it or curled or
anything like that I simply just when I
first got the hair I didn't wash I just
put all the bundles on the cap and
constructed the wig cap and then I went
in and I did like a deep conditioning
with the hair and this is the pattern
that I got with the hair I really really
like this guy's like this is probably
one of the best patterns I've seen from
aliexpress based company it is a real
textured loose wave texture and you guys
can see how loose wave they are to the
end obviously some parts of the hair
like the closure won't be as loose wave
and you have to keep in mind that the
closure is shorter than the rest of the
bundle so it's kind of like a little
change in the lengths or whatever but I
really really like this guys um like I
said I'll try to insert it somewhere in
this video to show you guys if the hair
look like when I first got it so this is
completely four bundles in the closure
the closure is very nice it's nice to
see the parting I just recently started
doing kind of like slant parts were kind
of curved the part up I think it looks
more realistic and looks natural as you
guys know I never leave my hair on the
sides I don't leave any edges I don't
leave anything out I just simply just
put the wig on and try to make it look
as natural as possible but I noticed
when you're doing like a curved part it
actually looks really really nice and
more natural than usual and I just want
to shout out my Harry Potter shirt that
I got from forever 21 I really like this
shirts a crop top style shirt and it
just has Gryffindor on it
let's get that out there cuz I'm gonna
like to share and if any of you guys
know I'm Harry Potter fit and I did get
through Harry Potter books we'll go out
and get that book as well too so uh I
really like I said I don't leave any
baby hairs out of my natural hair or
anything like that so I feel like when
you do like a closure and you just kind
of like a nice side part it kind of
makes it look more natural I did add a
little bit of pressed powder just my
regular pressed powder that I put on my
makeup obviously to kind of make the
parting look a little bit better there
are some baby hairs around the perimeter
not too much I noticed with a lot of
these aliexpress based companies the
closures come with like a really long
baby hairs so I really don't like that
long long baby hair type of look so I
usually go in and try to like snip them
a little bit so I was able to snip this
one night I'll show you guys to here is
very very long guys by the way he's very
very long it's two 22 inch bundles one
20 and 18 and for 22 inches that
considers to be practically like a 24 26
and I was actually purposely getting
shorter links thinking that I was
getting it shorter lengths but I ended
up getting something that's long but
yeah so I'll leave all the specs down
for you guys down below and I will come
back with an update video on this hair I
just want to share this here with you
guys before they're transitioning into
winter because I have different hair
styles I've been doing for the winter
time so I hope you guys found this video
very informative make sure you thumbs up

will catch you guys in later video bye
