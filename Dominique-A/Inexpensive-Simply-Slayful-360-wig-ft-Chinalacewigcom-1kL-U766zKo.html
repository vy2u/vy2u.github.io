it you but you big deal these guardians
and reviews are honest so this is the
fact that the unit came in today and I
didn't receive it like this last time I
don't know if they've upgraded they're
kind of like manufacturing system or if
they just improve they're sent out but
they do put in this nice bag real
official the packaging and everything
was great so I think that's great and
just to show you guys on subscribe like
youtubers don't get the best stuff
because the first time I got hear from
them I did not get this I think they
just didn't upgrade on their system and
their packaging so they definitely
stepped their cookies up now this unit
that I'm showing you guys I've linked on
everything down below but this unit is
the number see f-16 eight it is 22
inches long and it's in the color
natural so it is the link front way and
I am going to show you guys what it
looks like now
right so this is what the unit looks
like guys it is a lace-front unit and it
is nice and straight and long and if it
actually is cut all the way at the end
straight too which is cool so this is a
360 wig guys so you get about four
inches of parking space in the front
area and then you get about two inches
of parting space in the back which is
great and one thing I've noticed about
this one is the parting in the front is
actually really long like I haven't seen
a plug the other tumblr that I've
reviewed that was cool this is more than
four inch as well as five six inches of
parting space the other companies that
interview that was kind of like this was
my first weeks comm they had a lot of
parting space in the front but this one
I'm actually pretty impressed it does
come about two inches of parking space
in the back it does have you stand in
three columns one at the base to on the
sides as well as one in the back one
adjustable strap it is a nice texture
it's almost like a silky / yaki and I
know I've been revealing a lot of
you miss wheet lately but it's really
hard to find a straight unit that's good
so I'm trying to give you guys some
ranges of different types let's see what
this one looks like I'm not going to do
this one done I'm just going to I'm
going to put this down make a part and
then strain it out for you guys - and
see exactly it looks like bone straight
I love long black and long straight here
so I hope this one looks good if they're
interested in seeing what this unit
looks like today I would like you to
stay tuned keep on watch yeah I know
yeah yeah
employee be reveal what you video is up
by parting yes
what tell me Mike sit on that Cindy at
whakatane time when you what stop do you
want like clip car stereo can you
indicate on there are no no I do
anything like one here while I'm here no
Mike you and I must be bad man girl why
not what you want to enroll me a local
news controls another field of no
finance law you wanna be private so you
go tell me what you want this is what
the unit looks like now one thing that
kind of threw me off in the beginning
when I was doing this is that the front
right here they kind of like tweeze it
like behind the baby here and then
tweeze it from the front so it's like
it's a little bit strange so what I
tried to do is use the dot to be glue
method to kind of pull it back a little
bit and then bring the hair up like this
to kind of make it look seemingly okay I
didn't add my press powder on the
parting space to give me the more of a
like realistic look because they did
this they kind of left a bigger gap
right here in the front so it's kind of
weird I think I had another experience
like that was another company - I don't
know why they do that because it just
kind of makes a look at your balls right
here so what I'll probably do to fix
that one is going in with my mask scare
just to kind of darken this part up if
you know what I mean guys just leave
your comments down below but one thing I
do like about the hair is that it's
really nice obviously I've straightened
it out it did come straight but it had
that kind of like packaged wave in it so
I did straighten it out I do not have it
a lot to bid on this unit I just put the
clothes in its intended just above strap
just to give it more of a tighter look I
do like the hair so far guys
the only thing that I find weird about
this here is just a parking space right
here which I will fix with the math
scare now let me show you guys how long
it is once I straightened it it's about
the same length it's a little bit longer
obviously because there's a have that
dip in it but it's a little bit longer
and yeah so the density is perfect it's
not too thick so if you want to wear
this here in the summertime you'll be
okay you already have too much of like a
sweater heat problem but if it was like
a thick here if it was like thick like a
kinky straight hair I would kind of
weaned away from it just because it
would be too hot for that but this one
is fine I straightened it like one
stroke and it was fine so you don't
really have to put too much effort to
get this to look really bone straight
because it's straight hair anyways so
that basically wraps up the video guys
make sure you guys leave your comments
down below also hit that thumbs up
button and that subscribe button and
don't forget to share this video with
your friends and family and I will catch
you guys later
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
