with another Kirby slash stick girl
trying all video so today's video guys
is sponsored by Shi inside.com
so I will leave all the information down
below if you're interested in purchasing
anything from this website so in today's
video I showed you guys a lot of clothes
and just one pair of shoes I didn't go
crazy with accessories this time just
because I'm like have like a accessory
overload at my house I'm trying to chill
so I did get like a lot of clothes to
try on for you guys now they do have a
plus-size section so definitely check
out Sheen sides plus size section they
go from size 0 X - 5 X and they are true
to size Plus Size US size guys so
definitely definitely check that out now
if you're interested in seeing what I
have to offer in today's Sean Haugh guys
I would like you to stay tuned and keep
on alright guys so starting off I'm
gonna show you some of the black items
that I got like I get a lot of black
clothes sometimes I never realized till
after I received the item that I kind of
do like a black clothing overhaul but
black is something easy to wear it's
easy to style so I definitely pick some
stuff out so the first dress that I got
guys is black obviously in it to the
size I believe extra large you know what
I think this one's in zip no this one's
inside 0x and this is from the plus size
section now this dress guys I did try it
on but I didn't do a 360 turn with this
one just because this dress was very
thin in the back and you can see like my
nuts and crannies and you can actually
see my full entire butt in the back so
um but I've kind of like full-body Spanx
like full underwear side of style Spanx
next time I probably just wear with that
or just put like some like little biker
shorts underneath it just because it's
really to see-through and it's
inappropriate especially cuz I'll flag
my video for that but I thought that
just was really sexy it's a really nice
body con dress I did wear thong Spanx
with it instead so it kind of didn't
cover my butt that much but I did wear
some thongs Spanx with it and the thong
Spanx worked it really smooth me out now
this is really cute guys it has that
letter that letter that lettuce kind of
lined like collar area it also has that
lettuce it's a lot less that ya like
lettuce lined or whatever
sleeve as well - very super sexy guys
that guy that's in a zero XL which is
basically like an extra large it's
really nice it's it's not too short and
one thing I notice about this one I
tried it on
it's not the type of dress that rides up
so it definitely stays in place which I
thought was nice very very sexy you
don't have to wear a bra with this one I
didn't wear a bra with it and that's
kind of inappropriate to sell my boobs
and so it's kind of like whatever and
even when I didn't even when I was a
smaller breast implant size I didn't
wear bras anyways with my dresses just
because it kind of defeated the purpose
of you know it's just too much wearing a
bra it's just too much but with this one
I didn't wear a bra with it
I did try this on for you guys two ways
I did try it on with the corset kind of
one of those little corset things corset
belt and I thought it was really cute
with the corset belt it gave me really
more of a snatch waist in that so you
can definitely add like belts and layers
to this one just to make it look cute
but I deputy thought this is a cute
dress maybe Valentine's Day dress
something really sexy and nice so um I
would recommend getting this I would
just recommend wearing it with like full
bottoms like full button with Spanx so
that it just covers a whole entire but
thongs Spanx are a little tricky because
you can see all your nooks and crannies
because the dress is a little too so the
next rest I'm gonna show you guys is
really cute now this one I guy in a size
larger I got it from the regular section
at the plus-size section now this is a
nice velvet black dress guys it does
have like a really cute design on it so
it has like the fur collar right here
and along with the sleeves that has this
really cute sleeve fur on the sleeves as
well and these are kind of like those
bell sleeves which I thought was really
cute this bell sleeve pattern thing is
really trending now so I wanted to try
something out like that now I like this
dress so much because it fit and I was
crossing my fingers that I got it I was
like yes it fits yes it fits like I said
size large is a very tricky size to
purchase when you're a little bit curvy
or bigger on she insider Romley the only
reason I'm saying that is because
sometimes you don't know if it's
stretchy I do tell you guys often to
read the description like on the
materials just because it'll kind of
give you like a perspective on what to
expect when you purchase clothes from
them but this one I think I read a
review and they said it was super
stretchy and I was looking at someone
else's measurements on there her way or
whatever and I was like you know what
she's that way she's that tall might
actually fit me so I got lucky this time
guys it actually fits I was really
really excited so it's really cute guys
I paired it with my blonde wig and I
thought it just gave me like this really
nice kind of glam look I just really
liked it a lot I definitely would wear
this dress with that hair kind of like a
nice little bob style now this is really
cute guys the only
about this isreally linty so you'll get
like a lot of lint specs and a lot of
pieces of here my plant hairs all over
it but I do like this a lot guys it's a
really nice dress it is a little bit
short so I would say if you're like
really really tall or really really
curvy you'll have issue you'll run into
a lot of issues just because it is
really short but I think it's really
nice just to wear it even on Valentine's
Day something really cute and sassy or
if you have an event to go to I think it
would look really nice so I would
definitely recommend buying this if this
is your Flair this is your style I think
it's a really cute look and it just goes
so nice like I just I really really like
it now the next thing I got is this
really cute shirt and I featured this in
like my last a hair video and it's
people just love the shirt now this
shirt was also on the regular section
and it's a size large now this shirt is
a see-through shirt guy so I would
recommend wearing some type of bra
underneath it however when I was trying
this on I did not have a bra let on so I
just tried it and covered up my boobs
now it's kind of like a sparkly kind of
like see-through top and has like little
white stars on it that are really cute
now this is crops top crop top style so
I have the right I would wear this guys
is with like a little bra let or like
one of the little band DOS and wear some
high-waisted pants and tuck the shirt
into it that would look so smashing guys
I think that would be like such a nice
outfit I thought this show was really
cute guys it's like a little bit of a
turtleneck it's not too much of a
turtleneck and definitely it's
see-through so if you do have kind of
like pasties maybe my boobs looked
actually pretty good in it so if you
have pasties
I put the pasties over my nipples and
then just wear it like that if you're
comfortable doing that not a lot of
people are comfortable doing that but
the shirt was really cute the concept
that this shirt was cute it was a nice
soft material it's a little bit um it
could come up being a little bit itchy
but it does the job it's really cute
something simple and like I said I would
wear this with high-waisted black jeans
tuck in the top and then just wear like
some booties or something and just call
it a day
I thought it was well worth the price
that was ballistic for it's really cute
and it is definitely stretchy so if
you're like someone that's my size
you're a little bit bigger than me you
can definitely get away with that top
now the next type I want to show you
guys it's really cute now when I picked
this out I didn't expect it to be this
cute now when I mean cute I'm not
talking about like something real sexy
real artistic real design
this is really simple but it has like a
nice sort of design on it that just kind
of brings a little bit life to it now I
love black you guys know I said in the
beginning so this shirt is a size extra
large guys it kind of has like it's it's
off the shoulder I believe I don't
remember that show derp I think so I'm
not sure so it's off the shoulder guys
it has like this nice kind of like
strappy kind of design on it which I
thought was cute
it just gives like a lot of sex appeal
on the collarbone area and shoulder area
and has like a little bit of a peekaboo
area in the front right here so you can
get like a little bit of cleavage
showing nothing too crazy that's gonna
be like you know too ostentatious just
something real simple it does kind of
like a wide spread out kind of layer so
therefore it's not really tight on your
stomach it's kind of like nice and wide
out so you can wear leggings with it or
you can wear like some jeans with it and
not feel like you're to confide or to
roll your puffy in that area I thought
this was really nice guys it was
inexpensive it is very soft it's like a
cotton material and I just something
comfortable to wear you don't always
have to wear like really nice dressy
tops I thought this top was really cute
now the next topic guys one of my
favorites I always like stuff like this
I don't want to have a lot of screen
tease anymore I kind of wear like a lot
of basic tops now so I wanted to get
this one I had a t-shirt like this years
ago but I do not know where that t-shirt
is that I'm really like a great t-shirt
fanatic so when I saw this one I had to
get it so I have that really cute I
don't even know what this design set it
says royal royal royal I guess it's
really cute it has kind of like a little
skull head and the roses and stuff at
down the yellow accent just went well I
love gray t-shirts especially this one
because this one is distressed all over
it just gives more of an edgy vibe if
you guys know me I'm kind of like a
sneaker person I love wearing sneakers
not all the time like I really I like
wearing a lot of like trendy sneakers
and stuff like that but not like too
much sometimes you'll catch me in like
flats a lot like kind of like those cute
little designer flats but I do like
wearing sneakers so like I like wearing
screen tee sneakers leggings jeans and
stuff like that when I'm trying to be
really casual so I thought this was cute
and I just like the gray color this type
of grey it's kind of like a heather gray
it just looks really good on my skin and
without fits it just gives it more of a
relaxed look so I definitely like screen
tease like this
I believe this one is a size extra-large
know what this one's a size small no way
no way okay so that's the size small but
it was listed as oversize so small
oversized large would have been like
gigantic size so it's really cute
I can't believe exercise to mom sighs
mom but it's really cute and I thought
that it was well worth the coin
now the next chest that I got it's funny
because I picked this out way before
that this year started so I got the
package kind of late because they send
their stuff out kind of late it comes
from China so you're not expecting to
see that that package for two weeks and
even if I'm reviewing the product I'm
not gonna get it like you um you know
fast they're gonna send it out the
regular way so this dress I kind of
bought I kind of picked it up before
like for New Year's kind of do like some
type of New Year's look but it came late
so here it goes
so this dress was from the plus-size
section as well now I got this dress I
believe in a zero XL as well which is an
extra-large it's really no I lied I got
this in a size 1 XL so this one is a
really nice dress guys it's very sparkly
and I was kind of going for that nice
little sparkly theme I thought I was
gonna be killing this sparkly theme this
new year let me tell you something next
New Year's I'm not doing any of that
stuff like I didn't do that much I went
out to dinner but I'm just not I'm not
I'm not doing it I'm partaking in any of
that stuff I actually got it I got
really close to the ball drop because my
boyfriend works for New York City so he
gets easy access pass like he can just
go like into the thing so we got in free
and got really close to the ball job but
it was cold outside and it was just too
much for me so I don't think I'm gonna
be doing that next year I think I'm just
gonna stay home and do like a family
thing instead just because it was just
too much but if I ever have an event to
go to I think this just will be great
for it it's a very nice dress guys
SuperDuper sparkly very very sexy very
and you know what it's sexy but it's not
too sexy the the cut of the dress the UM
the little V cut on hair is perfect it's
not too sexy not too low-cut which I
thought was really nice and I appreciate
that because I honestly feel like the
cut shouldn't be all the way down to the
belly button that's ridiculous no one
wants to walk outside with a cut
down to the belly button it's
inappropriate sometimes and it's just
like it's not I don't feel comfortable
like I just feel like it's just too much
and I don't want to sell myself to
everyone so I thought it was really cute
has a nice cut on it I like the green
and blue kind of like sparkly accent on
is very nice it is a very very heavy
dress though guys it's SuperDuper heavy
so you know it's a lot of material on
this bad boy but it definitely is nice
it's not too short very sexy very
refined they did a great job and I was
expecting to see a little bit of these
um sequins things on my floor but none
of them fell off surprisingly so I was
actually pretty surprised not one of
these fell off so I was like you know
that's pretty good so I definitely this
is something to consider
even though New Year's is over if you
have a good event to go to in a second
like a formal event or something like
that you want to look nice I don't think
that this dress would definitely work
for that so I'm definitely keep it for
an event it's definitely worth it so the
next two things I got I kind of like
hoodies style material tops now they're
almost like you know what I actually
think they're supposed to be dresses but
that doesn't kind of work out my favor
so I'm just gonna wear them like kind of
like oversized hoodies with leggings and
stuff like that so the first one that I
got is really really cute when my
favorites and I actually have a
toothpaste thing on it so just disregard
that now it's really cute guys it's like
an army fatigue sweatshirt now it does
come really really long and it has like
this nice strappy kind of like accent in
the front with these Knights openings
with kind of like this chrome style
detailing on it which I thought was
really cute now this one is a size large
and I got in the regular section now it
didn't list it as being oversized so I
expected it to be oversized or at least
not oversized but at least something
that I could wear like with leggings and
it could kind of be like mostly a dress
so this one actually fit the description
perfectly
so I wish if they had bigger sizes maybe
like a 1x I could award as a dress I do
like this army fatigue they did an
excellent job on the army fatigue it's
not that fake looking army fatigue it
actually looks pretty realistic it's a
nice cotton soft material guys it's
really really nice now this is something
I like to wear what layers I like to put
a bomber jacket over or wear some
leather jacket or
more like a nice park over it it's very
comfortable very soft and it's really
really nice
now the sleeves are cute as well too
because it's leaves actually cuff up and
they have like just plain green on the
sleeves which I thought was really nice
it's a super duper stretchy sweater guys
so like I said if you're bigger and
you're want to make your attempts on
this one you can definitely fit into the
size large it's super stretchy and super
nice I thought it was cute I love army
fatigue I just like colors like this the
green colors and khaki colors and stuff
at that so I thought this was definitely
good steel and it does it is marked as
oversized so they definitely didn't lie
about it it's oversized and it looks
great now the next thing I got was from
the plus-size section it is a hoodie
dress as well now this one is black and
it has like a little bit of a velvet
detailing on it now initially when I saw
guys and I saw the writing on the front
of the dress a sweater dress or hoodie
dress I was like no no I'm not really
into stuff like this so I'm probably
gonna cover this up so this one says
baby girl
luck in year XL I don't know what that
is I'm not sure what that means
translation I don't know what they mean
by that but I liked it so what I'm
probably good I like that
no I don't like that phrase but I like
the whole concept so I don't probably
know just patch over this one with
something else or just cut me I'm gonna
just go over with something else you can
go I think it's Michaels or like any of
those kind of arts and crafts stores and
you can buy like press-on stuff so I'm
gonna just press something on top of
this one and call it a day cuz I am NOT
a big fan of this baby girl thing that
is so old-school
but I did like the sweater though it's
really nice this one I probably can get
away with ring has a dress I would just
have to wear some over the knee heeled
boots or just over the knee boots period
with them just because it does cut a
little bit short and I kind of feel like
if I raised my arm up a little bit the
dresser just rise up however it's super
cute guys it has like this velvet
detailing on the sleeve I just thought
that was really nice you guys know I'm
in love with velvet like I'm like having
like a velvet crush right now it is
really nice comfortable very soft it's
like a true cotton material true sweater
material I got this in the plus-size
section in this size extra large this
extra large 0 XL same damn thing like I
said it's really nice it has the actual
these are not false
strings on the hoodie these are actual
real strings so they do kind of suck in
and cuff together so I thought that was
nice I definitely like this guy's I
really really like this a lot and it's
very comfortable and soft that'll be a
transitional piece especially when
you're getting into the spring and you
have like those 50 degrees 60 degree
nights you can definitely put this on
and be just very comfortable with it so
I thought that this was real well worth
it and like I said if you're not a fan
of the baby girl phrase in the front you
can definitely go in and do your own
thing with it by like ironing down
something else or just doing your own
thing by changing that up and I'm sure
you can find YouTube videos where you
can just detail those and design it by
yourself so definitely check that out
but I definitely think that this was
well worth it it's really cute guys so
the next top that I got it's a little
bit strange for me but it fit it was
just kind of like a weird top to wear so
I was just kind of figuring what am I
gonna do with it so if anything happens
I probably saw it on Poshmark
I'm not sure when I'm gonna start to
pass mark you guys gotta give me some
time I just had a lot of things going on
the last two weeks so I'm just trying to
come back and do my thing so this top is
like a red top it's supposed to be like
a wrap I thought all supposed to be a
wrap dress maybe I'm confused I don't
know so I think it's supposed to be like
a dress but it doesn't fit me as a dress
it fits me more of a shirt now this what
I did what did I get this in the plus
size I believe I got this in the I got
this in the regular section I think this
is a size large now like I said I read
them a tear on this one so that's why I
went and got it now it's different guys
it just has like it's like it had kind
of like these really detailed sleeves
right here which are really cool I'm
unsure if it's off the shoulder if it's
on the shoulder like it's just so
confusing guys but it's really nice the
material to me just throws me off a
little bit it's kind of like paper mache
like it's like a weird material like I
don't know you can hear that it's like a
really weird material and I wasn't
expecting that when I got it now what
I'm gonna have to do with this one guys
is I'm going to either have to wear with
jeans to wear with some type of leggings
it is really low-cut so if you're not if
you're like really worried about having
your boobs out just be careful cuz it's
really really low-cut but I don't know
what I'm gonna do yet I think it's okay
it's not that great but it's wearable
and it's definitely red so if you want
to wear for Valentine's Day
now the next chest that I got guys that
thought it was too Riku and I kind of
have
this whole vacation idea with it now it
is white so I'm not gonna put it up the
screen because it'll wash me out so you
guys are seeing it across the screen now
this is a really cute dress guys it's a
it's kind of like a two-piece dress kind
of stuck together now it does go over
the neck and I'm not really somebody
that likes that kind of like back tie
neck type of style thing I hate that on
bikini sometimes just because it hurts
the back of my neck but for the purpose
of being cute it's alright I guess so
this is really cute guys it has like
this really nice tribal design on the
front now it is a two-piece meaning that
half of it cuts like a little string
connects the skirt to the top so
basically you have like this nice long
skirt now the scare for me is just a
little bit too long guys I got this in
the plus-size section in the size 1x
al I wish they had this in a zero XL or
extra larges because I felt like the
skirt and the top were just a little bit
too big but I do like the style it's
really nice fresh colors fresh look now
because I'm going to Thailand it's more
Eiling in around the time I'm going it's
gonna be Swick and hot outside and it's
gonna be like that type of weather where
you want to be like you know you want to
be extra glossy extra you know pretty
extra sun kiss I definitely think this
dress will actually do very well out
there just because you don't have to
wear a lot of undergarments not saying
you're not to wear panties or anything
but you don't have to wear like a bra
you don't have to wear stuff like that
be very uncomfortable so it's a really
nice polyester style style material is
very thin and very comfortable so if you
want to wear it out to like a nice
tropical island or something you would
get away with it really nicely it's
really sexy has a nice cut on it a
little bit of a low back and it's a very
breathable material so you're not gonna
go sweating outrageously out in the
winter in the summer and the heat and
stuff like that so I thought this dress
was really nice and when I chose this on
the website I specifically thought in my
head that this just will be perfect for
my Thailand trip in March so that's why
I got it it is a little bit long so what
I'll probably have to do is go in and
get it tailored a little bit just
because it's just way too long for me
but once I get it hemmed a little bit at
the bottom I think it's gonna be
perfectly fine and it's just like I said
something you can put on if I'm doing
like like dinner one ask my boyfriend in
Thailand or something like that or if
we're just going to do fun things once I
get the bottom hemmed up and put some
sandals on with it I'm good to go
Duffey thought is just as cute very long
it has like a nice travel material to it
looks very cute and it has like a little
bit of a sex appeal to which I like so
I'm definitely gonna bring this with me
on my trip I think it was well worth the
price and they do have a lot of sizes in
this so this is a size when XL I would
prefer it as a zero XL or extra-large
but this will do and I think I'll be
just fine with all right guys so this is
the only otter where item that I picked
up from this website now it was kind of
going through the section and I was
trying to look for something like
thinking like oh maybe I could find like
something cool on this so I was really
having a hard time finding like any cool
jackets a lot of this stuff for small
size and I was a little scared that they
wouldn't fit so this jacket is actually
sized in like 3 X 2 X or whatever and I
was like you know what this would be a
better chance to take and I actually
want to try this size kind of cool so
this is a four kind of fall for a jacket
now it's really really big guys and it's
like a frosted pink color which I really
liked
now with this one guys it does come with
the hoodie but the issue with this is
that the inside the inside of material
is so like it's kind of like a mix of
cardboard box and like plastic I don't
know what the lining is made of but it's
like a weird like you guys hear that
it's kind of like one of those weird
squishy signing materials and I just was
not feeling that at all now when you put
this on it's kind of weird
it fits my arms it fits my body but the
issue with this jacket though it doesn't
close up so it's kind of like it's only
it's only meant to be worn like open
like that's what I'm starting to think
but honestly if I close it up I'll
probably look like a little sasquatch or
like a mini sasquatch or that kinda like
an oompa loompa so I kind of said to
myself I'll probably just wear this like
with it open it's really cute guys it's
like a nice it's like really fun like
look at that look at that arm I don't
know it was fun to me so I thought it
was really cute so that's why I picked
it out it's a really fun nice soft
material I'm just not a fan of the inner
lining of this it's just kind of weird
it's kind of cheaply made so that was
the only thing that threw me off was the
inner lining other than I thought this
was really cute you can definitely style
it up a layer wise like I layered it
with like a shirt and pair of pants I
thought that was cute too nothing crazy
so I definitely think it's really cute
to layer it up it's a really nice
pink is a fun color so when I saw that
it was pink and I was size in a larger
size I was like yes I'm getting this
right away so I definitely think that
this is cute I'm not sure what it's
priced at if it's priced like $30 and up
I don't think so
but I'd be surprised like at 20 bucks
and it's okay to get just because it's
$20 it's fashionable it's nice but when
you start hitting the 40 and up it's
just kind of like come on now
No so if it's price well guys I
definitely recommend getting it if
you're someone that likes to mix your
patterns off and just likes to test the
ropes and stuff like that definitely
look into getting this I thought it was
cute
honestly it was pretty cute so the last
clothing item that I got guys was this
cute jumpsuit now this is the only
jumpsuit I got from this website and I
absolutely love this one now this fellow
only one that I said I absolutely love
but honestly a lot of this stuff I
absolutely love I think in all my child
hauls I absolutely love everything yeah
mm-hmm pretty much so this one is a nice
kind of like four screen color now this
one is it jumps to you guys and it has
like a little bit of a skirt on the back
of it so it's a it's kind of like a
skinny leg is basically like legging
style pants so you're jumping into like
a pantsuit that's a legging style and
then you have this nice fold out kind of
like cute sexy sachet style skirt over
it now it definitely has kind of like a
divider in it so you kind of get a
divider in the front here so you're
gonna get like a little cutoff here and
then you have like a little opening
where the skirt comes in and then you
have the pants so it's really cute guys
what I do with this one is add a little
bit of an accessory belt to it if you
watched my zap full Tron haul I showed
you guys that double that double belted
a waist belt that I got so I put that on
with this one just because the gold
access and it just gave me so much
freaking life I thought that this was
fabulous guys the whole entire concept
from head to toe even not even head to
toe cos I don't put shoes on with it but
honestly with shoes was all worth like
some really nice black heels very simple
this it was yeah and this is in the
plus-size section I got this one in a
zero XL yes guys definitely consider
this one this is very very cute I showed
my sister my sister was like wow that is
it so I'm going to New Orleans so this
will be my New Orleans fit one night
like this is it now the last thing I'm
going to show you guys of this whole
entire hall are these cute shoes that I
picked out now these are the only
accessory items that I got and I know
I'm like a frequent and comes to stuff
like this but there's shoe selection on
romwe and she inside are amazing
everything that you see on their website
as far as the shoes is exactly what
you're gonna get
I have not been disappointed yet with
their shoe selection and their heels
their booties everything has been just
on point so that's one thing about the
website that will never fill you the
shoe selection and the sizing is
excellent now these shoes that I got
like these little cute slip on sneaker
things now I like these guys just
because of the kind of like that
bedazzled look that it has in the front
they're kind of like little rhinestones
in the front and it's like a rose gold
color it's not a shoe that you're gonna
lace up so it has like a little stretch
panel right here where you can just
tighten it up to make it tight it does
have like this nice glisten kind of rose
gold metallic print on it and they're
just really cute they kind of remind me
of kind of like some simple work shoes I
know it's not realistic to wear these
because they don't have laces and if I'm
tripping all over the place I'm hurting
myself but sometimes I do like really
like home care cases so therefore I'm
just doing a lot of hospice where it's
kind of easy like I don't have to do too
much like back-breaking work if you know
what I mean if you've been asked if you
know if you're a hospice nurse you know
I'm talking about
so just wearing like really cute
fashionable shoes is nice sometimes to
wear and even if I'm not going to work
just on a regular day man I want to wear
like a real basic look and just put like
these really cute shoes on I think that
these shoes are really really nice guys
they aren't very comfortable I tried
them on their size us9 which is a UK 40
for me a kind of ranges sometimes I'll
be able to get away with a u.s. eight or
a u.s. nine and sometimes I'm just gonna
be just stuck with the US nine these fit
true to size guys so when you're buying
shoes from this company do not be afraid
to purchase your sneakers their shoes
fit exactly the way they fit just meet
you all you need to do is follow your
size and compare it with other people
that reviewed it and compared with the
size that they have listed and will
always link it it will always list it as
a
sighs you are yeah like a European size
so the European size for size nine it's
40 so if you are size eight I believe
it's Europe its European size 39 so
definitely watch out for that but these
fit very good and on the bottom it
actually says size 9 so they knew
exactly what I wanted
they're very cute guys very simple like
I said I'm not somebody's gonna buy like
designer sneakers like I buy Nikes and
stuff like that but like designer wise
this has like a little bit of a designer
feel and I think these were really cheap
so it's definitely going to be one of my
little fashionable wares so I thought it
was cute lovely details love the
bedazzled on it and it's just it was
perfect and it just it was just for me
