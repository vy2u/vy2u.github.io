hey guys how's it going gone back today
with another wig review now in today's
video I'll be featuring away from a
company called L wigs calm all the
information for this unit will be linked
down below for you guys so you guys
don't have to worry about anything now
this wig is an ombre unit and it's a 360
wig and it's 14 inches long and the
colors I chose it's kind of like it was
kind of like a 1b 30 unit
I had to dye the hair guys just because
when I got it it was just so brassy and
I just was not I was not pleased brassy
meaning the color was like almost the
color right tank top and I just was like
damn I don't like this at all
so I went in with the Revlon color silks
hair diamond and the number 70 in medium
ash blonde now obviously you'll see in
the beginning that I showed you guys or
I'll put in and clip somewhere here that
I use those products to get this hear
from being that ashy tone so now it's
kind of like a tone like this it
supposed to be like an ashy tone now on
plan camera I feel like it's coming out
almost similar to what it looked like
before but in person it definitely looks
different I was initially trying to go
for that look that Beyonce had in the
album a few albums ago and if you know
what I saw was leaves down below I put
it somewhere down here for you guys it
was her hair was looking that cute
little bob it was kind of like a wavy
bob kind of messy I was looking for
something like that for the summertime
so I wanted to get an ombre wig that was
shorter to kind of relive Beyonce moment
so that's why I chose this one and it's
a 14 inch and I did deep wave it so it
didn't come in this deep wave pattern I
went in with my deep waver and deep ways
into this pattern I thought it would be
really cute in the color and yeah so
does come with three combs at the base
it comes with three comb to the front
there's two on the sides right here and
one at the base not only we use this
comb right here and there's also comb in
the back of an adjustable strap now I'm
going to I'm not going to add an elastic
band on this one just because it fits my
head fine I will link down the cap size
and everything from my head and for
people that kind of small heads like I
do and I will leave that down below for
you guys so I'm going to go ahead and
try this on and show you
looks like and give you my final
thoughts about it make sure you guys
thumbs up the video leave your comments
down below and hit that subscribe button
and I want you guys
give us pesky bombs
alright guys so this is the finished
results of what I did with the wig I
just put on my hand I kind of played
around with it a little bit trying to
get a style that I thought would be cute
I was kind of thinking about like the
Beyonce style when she had and 2 hours
ago and I just can't remember
the album oh my god I remember and I'm a
big fan but I link it down somewhere in
this video for you guys and she had like
that cute little bob like wavy bob
blonde bob thing going on I just thought
it was so cute so I wanted to kind of do
that with this unit either this units
longer it's like 14 inches Krita and
then when I crimped is kinda like 12
inches now but I think it's so cute I
did a kind of playing around with baby
hairs and I did a top bun with it I just
think this looks so cute and kind of
like fun for the summer vacation here
like it's just so pretty what am I going
to what I'm going to say is that when I
did watch the co washing her hair was
wavy after so it's supposed to be
straight but it's kind of like a natural
wave in a way I didn't give me some
beautiful waves out there I watched it
kind of like what it looks like now but
I deep leaves it to get this look now I
don't get any shedding tangling or
anything from this hair it's just like
ultimately cool and perfect like and
like that I serious the pre ombre that
they did to it is really well done it's
free on braids throughout the whole
entire thing and the way that they kind
of the gradient like the way that they
kind of flow the ombre is like perfect
not a lot of people are really good with
that when it comes to me keeping the
roots dark and then giving you blunt end
like they did it really nice and
gradually alone all the way around so I
really think that they nailed that one
it's like perfect like you have no
complaints about that
one thing that was annoying to begin
with the color but I kind of toned it
down I like how it looks now it does
kind of match my complexion which kind
of kind of throws me off a little bit
but just make sure you tone it and when
you tone it will kind of give you a
little bit more depth to your look so
guys I hope you guys enjoyed this video
