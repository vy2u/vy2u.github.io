hey guys how's it going so I'm back
today with another hair of you so
obviously you guys saw on the title
this unit is near and dear to my heart
guys this unit is a unit that I custom
created for my first Winx comm so this
unit is called Dominique and it is
created by me so I kind of was going to
try to figure out what kind of a guy
wanted to create for them for the
website and for myself so when I kind of
thought about all the videos that I did
I came up with the the idea of doing a
bob style unit that was a Yaqui textured
unit that was probably one of my most
popular videos on here recently and just
a lot of the reviews that i've done i've
gotten more views off the bob unit like
everyone can rock a middle part black
wig and stuff like that long black wig
or a kind of like ombre style wig but
bombs are something that people just
drawn to and I'm really drawn to Bob's
just because they look really nice it
can either be casual or classy it's just
a hairstyle that I really feel like is
just versatile you can wear it like
anywhere all the time no matter what so
I wanted to create this unit just
because I wanted something that was
really nice and fresh a nice density not
too thick and not too thin and you guys
know I'm obsessed with the architecture
here so I had to get some yaki textured
hair for this unit now this is a
perfectly cut bob guys and the video I
didn't have to do anything as far as
styling it meaning cutting it so they
custom cut it perfectly to the length
and the kind of style that I liked and
basically what we did was kind of
reference it off of the video that I did
and I'll attach the video up here when I
did the stocking cap method I actually
cut that wig by myself and the way came
out perfect so this wig is almost a
replica of that exact same style that I
did on that unit so if you want to see
that video I'll link it up here for you
guys so I was trying to go for a look
just like that because a lot of you guys
wanted to kind of get a wig like that
that was cut like that styled like that
so the whole purpose of me making this
wig is to give you guys opportunity to
go out and purchase a wig that was
resembles exactly that wig now I love
this so much guys it's a really nice
nice light yaki here so you guys know
I'm obsessed with yaki here the reason
why I'm obsessed with yaki here is
because when it comes to you it's a nice
text
it's not thin it also has a nice luster
and when you do put your straightener
through it it just makes it look so much
better and it just gives a hair more of
a realistic vibe now you don't have to
be african-american to wear yaki
textured hair you can be Caucasian you
can be middle-eastern you could be
whatever if you want to wear hair like
this
I recommend do putting it straight just
straighten it lightly just to give it a
nice crisp look and it just look at this
like it's just so so nice so what I did
do guys I did go in and I went and I
just cut the baby hairs a little bit and
just in my little baby hair magic on the
side I do add powder on it like I always
do in all my videos just because the
powder bring it more to life so I did
add powder in the parting space here and
around the opening areas where the baby
hair was shown now with this unit eyes
it's not a full lace wig it is just lace
in the front right here and then there's
like tracks in the back but it's enough
parting space about three to
three-and-a-half to four inches of
parting space so you have enough party
space to do whatever you want what I do
with this unit guys I just went in and
just cut the baby hair just slightly the
baby hairs weren't too long and crazy so
it's just like something real simple
that I did with it so I just went and
cut the baby here's a little bit and
it's just so use my got to be glue just
to lay them down now I did use a yellow
got to be glue I should use a black one
but I actually ran out of it so I need
to get another one the black one does do
better with the baby hairs versus the
yellow one the yellow one I do use just
to kind of put the weight down but the
black one is perfect for the baby here
so I'll probably just have to get some
more of that other than that guys that's
all I did with this unit when I do my
baby hairs I don't do them all the way
around the perimeter here just because
the bang is there and you're not gonna
see it so it's kind of pointless so
that's basically all I did as far as
stylist unit guys it was very simple and
I did show you guys at the back look
like it's just it's just nice overall
guys and I do want to say before I run
off of this video I just want to say
thank you to everyone who supported me
