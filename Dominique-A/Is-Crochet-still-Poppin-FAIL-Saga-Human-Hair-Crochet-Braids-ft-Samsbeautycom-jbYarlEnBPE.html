be a little bit different so in today's
video guys I'm gonna show you how I make
a crocheted styled unit now for me this
is going to be a little bit different
because I don't really do this but I try
to give this when I go ahead now even
before you click off this video try to
fast forward just to watch what I'm
talking about so this video to me is
gonna be a fail video I just do not
understand how this didn't work I've
done another unit using this cat before
but I think it's because I use dreads
instead and the dreads worked out so
this is crocheted here from Milky Way
and it's they're a hundred percent human
hair crocheted here now the loops threw
me off the hair threw me off everything
was kind of weird I do like the hair the
texture of the hair is nice it's curly
it's pretty however the way they
constructed pre-boot crochet pieces was
terrible now if you keep watching this
video you're gonna see exactly what I'm
talking about
alright guys as you guys can see in the
title this video to me is a complete
fail video now I know that's a probably
looking at thinking like oh my hair
looks nice maybe that's just because I
got like a beat face on I did a couple
freckles on my face and I got like a
real vampy type of kind of berry lip but
besides that the hair guys to me is know
so this hands from Milky Way in saga
collection the crochet a hundred percent
human here it's pretty looped so
therefore if you saw in the beginning of
the video I showed you guys each of the
individual loops now I don't know how to
put this like if there's different
aspects of this this hair that created
it that kind of made it either like a
bad look or a good look now one thing
I'm gonna say is I use that braided
cornrow braiding cap and I've used that
previously and been successful with it
so I'm not gonna breathe the cat I'm not
gonna blame the cat for the destruction
of this whole entire look what I would
say is I hated the pre looped a style
that they use on this one now I'm not
trying to throw shade a milky way it is
their first time creating a type of
affordable crochet this way but guys
it's not even that affordable because
well it is affordable but when you have
to buy more than one pack it can get
kind of expensive now meaning I use six
packs of hair to create this little unit
and I still have a lot of bald spots at
the top now I had to even go to the back
and pull some of the crochet out the
back to kind of enter it into the kind
of crown area here so therefore I didn't
come out here looking like Baldy Yalda
Yalda so it's just not enough hair and
if you looked at the when I showed you
guys it was so tiny and it's like it's
like small it's like two two pieces
equalled my pinky so it's not that much
so it doesn't take a lot of surface area
however look at how big the hair is
after you put six packs in it now what I
mean it doesn't take surface area it's
not it's the hair puffs up big at the
ends but when you're doing a crochet
actually on the braided part it's not
it's not it doesn't take that much
surface area it only holds like a little
section of like it's just it doesn't
match to me and it's just really
confusing because when I saw I'm
thinking like oh this must be a pop of
wiggle
do this real quick and I've encountered
the packs initially I thought I have
five packs worth that I counted six and
I'm like okay I got this is gonna work
like three hours later not even think it
took me like two hours I already have to
do this like an hour and half later I'm
just not going anywhere with this so it
just was a complete fail I do like this
the style and the color of the style and
the texture of this hair it's a curly
pattern it is really nice guys but like
I said this one I would have to use ten
packs of hair cuz I only used six so I
would need four more packs to really
close this in and pull this up together
if I would have used ten packs of hair
my hair would have been all the way out
here and that to me is just unrealistic
guys like not everybody wants to walk
around like that we're not going to
perform at a concert or anything like
that I just wanted a nice little simple
kind of like african-american texture
wise we're kind of like afro centric
kind of styled hair this mimics my hair
so therefore I want to in a longer
version nice neat version and this is
definitely a good kind of hair soft for
someone who's natural there's no
protective hairstyles there is a girl
YouTube and I'll try to link her name
down below here or try to link her video
somewhere in this in my video she
actually she's Haitian as well too so
represent so she actually did a crochet
video with they're using this hair but
she actually did it on someone's actual
braided here and it actually came out
really nice I'm not sure how many packs
she used but the hair as well was buff
and I'm not gonna I don't know if mines
buffer that hurt someone that she did
and I'm not saying that it played around
at this hair too much but the hair is
just too buff and I kind of like think
to myself like if it's buff like this
how am I gonna manage this like what are
gonna have to do to get this hair to
maintain or kind of stay put so that
it's not like blowing up like every
second because I kind of feel like this
hair is the type of hair to swell up
honestly and truly but just initially
like when you look at it guys I know you
guys are like oh it looks nice or
whatever girl this no hmm you see no no
no
no it's all the disguised guys honestly
if I wanted to wear this and I wanted to
do a certain type of look you guys know
I'd like to switch up my wigs a lot if I
had a if I had a day when I was and
wanted to look like this I wanted to
wear an outfit in this hair was the
perfect hair further outfit I honestly
would have to put a hat on top of this
cuz I'm not walking outside with my head
like that that that's just embarrassing
guys it's unruly so I do like it though
it's pretty well free-spirited type of
hairstyle but like I said I'll probably
put a hat on top of it and try to style
with a hat instead I think putting a hat
on top it will kind of bring it give it
a little bit more of an edge it
definitely is a fun hairstyle and I wish
that I wanna stand truly wish that I
didn't have to worry about because I
would just wear this like wild like this
I think it looks really really cool if
my hair was long enough and I could get
braids I would have done braids but I
had a pixie cut and you guys know that I
cut my hair all the time so if I had
longer hair I could do braids and I
would just did a full circle crochet on
this one and just kind of did like some
nice frayed bangs in it that would have
been so cute I even tried to do this one
do that in this hairstyle and it didn't
work simply because there's too much
gapping there's too much there's too
much space left so it just didn't work
