hair review and this is from a company
called oMG her hair calm you can check
them out they saw that information down
below so they sent me
Italian yaki wig in 20 inches natural
color 130 percent density and it's a
gluey lace front wig cap it comes with
three combs on the top and one come in
the back with adjustable straps the
hairs texture is very fun it resembles
African American hair texture basically
what I'm gonna do it's cut the lace off
with this wig and try to find parting
space for this wig
the lace is very soft I don't receive
any shedding or tangling form this unit
so far the length is very good it like
lands right up below my boobs which is
good for 20 inches I'm not gonna layer
this thing off or do anything with this
here I'm just gonna keep it in its
length and I'll probably straighten it
out eventually just to give it more of a
bone straight look so basically what I'm
doing now is just looking through the
parting space after I've cut the lace up
just to see how much running space I
have available I'm just gonna use some
pressed powder to bring the parting
space to life and use some hairspray and
water to make the part more vivid I was
able to achieve two looks with this
middle part and then just a little
up/down look it looks very realistic
with the pressed powder and the baby
hairs actually looked pretty good as
well too the hair is a questionable 130
percent density but I think it looks
good and if I need to add extra
extensions in the back I will but so far
so good I give this hair probably an 8.5
and just tell me what you guys think so
here's a finished look so I've cut the
lace off I've applied the wig on my head
and I've also parted and added pressed
powder to it I didn't do anything else I
didn't strain it I basically had to to
get the part I just sprayed some put
some water down on a comb combed it down
and they use a curling iron just to
press it down and it kind of flattened
it out pretty nicely there are baby
hairs around this on the perimeter of
this unit but the baby has are a little
bit excessively long so I can't I could
care less for the baby hairs
I'll probably just tuck them in
underneath my side parts my side part
length right here I will not be layering
this hair
just the 20 inch is a perfect length you
don't really need to let her do anything
excessive I just want to wear it just
phone straight in one length I think it
looks really nice
I have not straightening yet with a
straightener so when I do strain it I
will come and post pictures and stuff
but I do really like this here guys I'll
show you guys the link so it stops like
right about underneath my boobs
it's very nice length the only thing I
find that strange about this he has a
density is 130 percent density but I
don't feel like this is under 30 percent
density this is more like a hundred
density 100 percent density which is
kind of like a very regular old wig kind
of like the old-school version they just
started making like higher densities now
but that's kind of like hair in there
kind of situation usually when I have
units like this and the density is not
as thick as you going and add my own
extensions into the tracks in the back
by myself express because this is a full
cap and it doesn't have a gap
soin or the cap tracks so I could just
go in and glue tracks or so tracks into
the back of this top but that's
questionable I don't know if I'm gonna
do that I'm probably just going like
this because it's not thick and it looks
very naturally nice
I didn't tweeze the part I just added
pressed powder and the part is very
natural and wide open so I really like
that about this wig I will list all the
information down below that you guys
need there is 20% off of your first win
purchase and up to 50% off of the

information you need on this unit I hope
