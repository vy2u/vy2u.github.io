today with another curvy slash stick
girl trying haul video so in today's
video guys and show you guys some jeans
for mono cheeks calm now I've previously
did a collab with them before on some
jeans today it's a little bit different
though because I size down this time in
their jeans so I'm wearing a size 15 now
so I'm not sure if I lost some weight or
you know if I'm just you know able to
squeeze my big ass into these jeans but
these jeans today definitely did fit now
I did get three other jeans and a size
1x just because I wanted to try them out
and I picked them out in the plus-size
section so I will show you guys what
they look like and talk to you guys
about this fitting and are all that kind
of stuff so yeah so I will leave all the
items down below for you guys if you
guys are interested in buying these
jeans and stuff so if you're interested
in seeing what I have to offer in
today's Sean Haugh I would like you to
stay tuned and keep on watching alright
guys so I'm gonna start off with the odd
things that I got that were kind of like
not genus so the first thing that I got
was this skirt now this jean skirt is
really cute I actually saw this on a
couple websites guys now in the
beginning I didn't like this jean skirt
because I was like oh the materia weird
he doesn't look right you know you got a
quickly bitch a little bit but I
actually think that this is cute with
the concept of wearing with sneakers the
same type of leather jacket whatever put
in the combination of an outfit together
with this skirt will actually be really
cute so I reconsider after trying it on
at me my friend we're looking at it like
mmm girl this is this is gonna be cute
so I picked this one out now this isn't
a size 1x and this is a brand Aphrodite
and I think they mainly use a Fredette
as their brand so the cool thing about
this when it does come with this really
cute little design on the side it's kind
of like a shoelace kind of strap up
thing it is it does show a little bit of
skin towards kind of like mid halfway up
here but it does have like a barrier up
here so you won't get a lot of skin shot
at the top or like your undies or
anything like that now it does come with
this dress heavy distress in the front
which is really cute so it has more of
like a fashionable sense to it's really
distressed looking and very cute one
thing about this skirt that I noticed is
that because I don't know one exit is it
tends to be like a little bit bigger
had I known this I would have gotten it
in the size 15 and the regular size just
because it would be nice of a sack good
but then again I thought about it like
hey it's cute it's a little bit
oversized a little bit big but if you
kind of style it with a cute little tops
and stuff like that like a half sweater
and stuff it'll be really cute so I
definitely have a lot of ideas with this
skirt I think it's really cute
and that's ound like a little split in
the front too which is also cute and
it's not such a short skirt where it's
inappropriate so it definitely will go
really well with outfits like all the
way in the winter time with like opening
the heel boots and stuff like that so I
definitely think that this was a good
deal
and it's priced very well so that's one
thing I want to mention about this
website their pricing is now the next
thing I got is a jean jacket and I've
been like on this jean jacket crazy I
just like jean jackets are so trendy
they're so fashionable they're so
stylish and there's so many ways that
you do rock a jean jacket and make it
look very cute so this is the first dark
one that I got all the other ones that I
showed you guys in my last hauls were
all light blue jacket it's kind of dark
light blue makes kind of jackets or
whatever but I wanted to pick out a dark
blue one so this is a dark blue one and
it's distress as well too so I picked
this one up in a size extra large extra
large and it is the bread appetite as
well and but it also says ap blue I
guess ap blue and aphrodite 'ns is the
same is under the same category so it's
a distressed jacket what I can say about
this one it is a bit um it is a bit
larger in the arm areas a little bit
loose but I don't care about that I love
an oversized jacket I love the look of
be the look and I like that it's not
tight you're not like so restricted with
that I hate clothes like that it's
really annoying and it's like really
like it's just painful walking around
with really like tight clothes I just
don't like it so this one is really good
guys I think it's so the way they
created this jacket is like to
perfection it's a really nice sturdy
jean jacket it definitely has a lot of
distress on it so that's one thing that
I noticed but I do like it a lot and one
thing I did notice is that type of dark
blue where like you rub it against a
wall and your walls are kind of like
staying so I think this one would
definitely to go into the wash before I
even attempt to wear it because against
a white shirt I don't feel like it would
kind of stain the white shirt too so
definitely when you get dark cool items
like this I would recommend washing it
before wearing just because it can get
kind of moving along guys so these jeans
that I'm gonna show you guys in our
blue jeans now the first one that I got
is the size 15 with the same brand as
well now these are really nice now these
aren't size 15 jeans guys but these
jeans are super super stretchy super
super stretching the legs wasting
everything so they give you a very
secure feel and a really nice look they
are skinny jeans and I did have to go
down and cuff them up a little bit just
because they were a little bit too not
skinny enough they're kind of like
bootleg a little bit but they are really
cute guys I do like these it does come
with like a really small way so if you
have a good size small waistband like a
small waist these will really cut you
real good which I liked I do like them
they have like very light distress on
them so it's nothing like a crazy
distress style Jean they're not really
like to distress which I like and it
does kind of like a fade pattern in the
front which is very simple which I adore
as well too so I definitely think that
these are cute and these are size 15 now
the next one I got I picked out of the
plus size section and these are size 1x
now these are more so distressed as this
is more of your distress style Jean and
I was trying to get a lot of playing
jeans because I do have a like a lot of
distress jeans
simply just because I review a lot for
these companies so I pick a lot of the
distressed jeans because distressed
jeans a lot of plus-size women feel like
they can't wear distressed jeans because
their bags are like popping out of the
holes but you know it doesn't matter
it's whatever you want to wear and have
whatever you want to style you can wear
whatever you want my thighs pop out are
all my jeans when I have distressed
pants on so I mean like I don't care as
long as it's tasteful and it's cute it's
well put together you can wear whatever
you want so I got these and these are
really cute I also had to cut these as
well too just because they were a little
bootleg my other than skinny which I
prefer so these aren't distressed very
simple the back is very simple to the
issue I had with these pants were that
they were way too big in the crotch area
in the stomach area so for me they were
too wide on the waist so it gave me kind
of like a long pouch so with these I
probably have to wear a longer shirt
over it or crying to find a way to kind
of cinch it in I know people go and get
their jeans tailored I might have to get
these tailored just because they're just
a little too big in the waist area
there are definitely good pants and
they're our size whatever nice to jeans
I'm gonna show you guys are some light
jeans now I kind of have like a theme
and I didn't realize I was picking them
out like that so I have a dark jeans
like jeans white jeans and those types
of things so it's kind of funny how I
picked these items off and also black
jeans as well so these two that I'm
going to show you guys are some light
wash jeans now I'm a really weird person
when it comes to kind of like I didn't
even like watch they're kind of semi
light wash jeans I always have an issue
when it comes to light wash jeans just
because it kind of goes it can go either
either two ways when you wear it could
either go bad or good with big thighs
but these were really really nice now
this one is stretchy it is a size 15 but
this one the waist part
oh it's tight and it really cinches you
in so if you're looking for a good cinch
in without shapewear and all that kind
of extra mise this will really suck you
up a really good now these are very
plain guys they're very very simple
there's nothing to these they are skinny
legs they're just straight up playing
jeans it does have like a little bit of
distress on the back pocket right here
and that's it so I thought these are
really cute they definitely could look
good with sneakers just very simple
jeans to wear like quick jeans nice
jeans with a screen tee you know the
whole nine yards with these ones and I
like these a lot
these aren't 15 they're super stretching
the thigh but area and but when it comes
to the waist it does really pull you in
tight so if you have an issue with your
waist ratio and your butt ratio be a
little bit wearing with these pants but
they do look really cute guys and I do
really like these a lot
now the next one I got is a super super
strong distressed style Jean I can
actually left the tag on here boy
so this one is super super distressed
and this is a size 15 now I got this one
I think I you know it's funny when I got
this when I looked at I was like hey
don't I have this one but I don't have
it here actually I have it at my
boyfriend's house and I was thinking
like don't I have a pair of jeans like
this and I killed myself looking for
these jeans on my house and then I
realized oh I left in my bass house
so they are my boyfriend's also this
will be my pair here so these are really
distressed guys and these are from the
brand vibrant now I got this in fashion
over in a size 1x and the 1x fit but the
1x it'll fit but once you wear it on the
day it kind of loosens on it becomes a
problem when you have to keep pulling it
up
so I picked these on the size 15 and the
size 15 is perfect I don't have to
shimmy shimmy Coco Puffs in this one I
do anything crazy this one fixed perfect
guys and these look really really good
they're super super stress and they're
also distressed all the way to the ankle
which I like I definitely think that
these will look cute with heels wrote
kind of dress this up kind of make it
more like a casual heel look with this
one really nice to the Blazer I don't
know I just had so many ideas with this
one and I really do like these pants
have you watched that video I said I
love these pants too so I don't know
these are great in their size 15 and
they fit perfectly so I definitely
highly recommend you pick these out
super distressed
super fashionable and super super key so
the next jeans that I got are these
white jeans so I'm not gonna show these
up to the camera just because it will
white wash me out now with these jeans
guys there are size 1x and these weren't
really my favorite jeans I have this
weird thing with white eye sometimes
white can look good and sometimes they
could just really kill the vibe now
white jeans they do you do show up a lot
and white jeans meaning all your nooks
crannies and stuff like that so I'm not
really like a big white pants type of
girl I wanted to chance these ones now I
definitely could have size down and at
15 with these but I got the 1x so maybe
if they were like a little bit more
fitted or you know maybe not because
sometimes when the pants are white and
they're fitted fitted you can really see
like a lot of dips and stuff like that
so it's kinda a hit or miss with these
pants I personally did not like these
pants but I did try them on for you guys
to X's show you guys can see but just
keeping it a hundred percent I didn't
like them at all I felt like it's
supposed to be skinny jean and they were
too wide leg at the ankle and it just
kind of threw me off a lot I do like the
concept of having the rips in the
kneecap area very simple but with a
little bit of jazz but for some reason
guys I just did not like the way that
these looked on me so what I wear these
probably not saw probably I'm give my
mom B's or my older sister because they
probably utilized this more than I would
but I'm keeping it honest with you guys
I'm not a fan of white jeans like that I
wanted to try them on for you guys and
show you guys something other than just
regular old Jean material so I gave you
the don't record in this video I noticed
on my eyes turning red
I'm telling you guys I have these issues
with these bio finiti contact lenses
they
giving me the worst worse like look at
my eye guys it's like instantaneously
turning around like as I'm recording
this video so I'm going to try to speed
this up because it's about time for me
to take my contacts I think it's been a
few hours and it's they're telling me
Dom take me out so guys the last two
pair of jeans that I'm gonna show you
guys are some black jeans and you know I
gotta have my black pants you know
holidays about to come up you want to do
it all black outfit with a turtleneck
and some heels mmm if you know what I
mean so the first thing I'm gonna show
you guys it's a distress pair now this
is a vibrant brand again and it's the
same exact style as the last Jean pair
so as a distress one that I got from
fashion OVA so this one is they're
basically just black exact same style
and their distress on the ankles the
same exact way as the last ones I
absolutely got in tell you guys I love
these jeans like I don't know if it's
because the way the bottom is distressed
or how it fits so well and it's
high-waisted but the bottom distress is
so cute with heels like it just it just
brings you to life like I don't know I
just really like these pants a lot super
super stretchy these are size 15 and the
black ones actually stretch more than
the Jean one stretches but that's just
probably because of the material so they
stretch really really good and it just
it really emphasizes your body very nice
now with these ones my thighs were
definitely like busting out of the seams
out of the ribs and stuff like that but
like I said if you're wearing it
tastefully and you're not like walking
around looking like crazy it's okay
do not feel uncomfortable and do not
feel like you can't wear what you want
to wear I tell you guys this all the
time I don't care like I don't care like
I'm just it's not that I don't care I'm
not trying to put myself out there
looking like inappropriate or bad or
whatever I want to carry myself in a
nice way so if I want to wear something
I'm gonna wear it and be proud and happy
to wear the items that I want to wear
it's just that type of year is just 2017
almost going into 2018 but the
confidence is gonna continue that so the
next pair of pants that I got are just
basic pants you guys see these pants a
dozen times everywhere like these are
the Aphrodite pants and these are size
actually 13 now these are the ones that
have like that high pockets in the back
and so it gives this big I call these
like the real big booty girl pants
so these sadly make your
but look really really big so if you
would naturally have like a big ol booty
these really emphasize your butt and
really elongate and kind of pronounce it
a lot I wear these a lot actually
sometimes used to wear these to work
which is kind of weird if I worked like
I'm doing like a business or stuff I
would wear like the scrub top with like
a long cardigan sweater and then I wore
in the pants and my sneakers so I used
to trying to get away with this one too
sometimes which is probably not good
guys but you girl had to do it
so um sometimes I would wear these too
and these aren't really cute they're
ankle style super super stretchy guys
and these are size 13 so I definitely
could size down in these I remember I
used to wear like a size 9 or 11 in
these that was way back then not anymore
but that's okay so I do like these a lot
guys these are inexpensive I think just
about everyone sells these like these
are like the it jeans like they do have
me white they have them in a whole bunch
of cause but I play say for you guys no
colors with me and my thighs just don't
really go too well so I'll stick to my
blacks and my blues and that's about it
all right guys so that basically wraps
up this video I hope you guys enjoyed
