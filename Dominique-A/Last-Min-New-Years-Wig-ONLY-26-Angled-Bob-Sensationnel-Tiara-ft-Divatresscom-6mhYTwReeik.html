today with another hair of you so
today's here foods a little bit warm an
inexpensive hair of you and I know you
guys asked me about this a lot so I
wanted to kind of give you guys some
more inexpensive wig reviews so this
unit that I'm showing you guys today is
from sensational and it's at empress
lace wig it's the lace front edge now
this one is called tiara and it's at a
color number one and it is a middle part
wig now this one guys is super
inexpensive on diva tres calm right now
this wig is 425 96 2595 guys honestly
now this one you really didn't have to
do anything to it as far as kind of like
styling it just because it's synthetic
it's already pre styled and you just
basically have to add some powder or
concealer on it and call it a day this
unit did come with a little bit of baby
hairs in the front so you just kinda saw
me glue down the little pieces of baby
had acted a wick was provided with so I
did have to go in and cut anything or
try to customize any part of this wig
the wig like I said you guys came
exactly the way you see it on my head
now all I did was add a little bit of
powder on the parting space in the
middle part and just lay the baby hair
down slightly and that was that now you
have the option to lay your baby hair
down and you have the option just to
leave it like that if you don't do that
it's not the end of the world you'll
still look fabulous this is what the wig
looks like now this is a really nice
deep angled bob guys you guys can see
how deep this cuts like guys honestly
for the price for 425 well I'm around at
$26 where you gonna find a wig like this
out like this week looks so so good and
even for my last minute wig buyers or
people who need a wig for New Year's
like this unit right here is definitely
a you a New Year's like look like
Express with an off the shoulder dress I
have a war dress just to kind of show
you guys like even with an off the
shoulder dress this hairstyle will look
so freaking fabulous guys like I
definitely think it's really nice I
almost went in with my scissors and kind
of cut it a little bit just because I
just feel like the angle blob is just a
little bit too long maybe that's just in
my head but I've been
cocking Bob's alot and you guys know I
love a good angle Bob I like love a good
layered Bob and stuff like that I just
kind of felt like this was a little bit
too long in the front but I'm gonna
leave it the way it is just because of
the sex appeal this unit definitely has
like a great sexy look to it it's kind
of like edgy I did go with the color
number one jet black just because I do
like a nice jet black unit it just
there's something about it against dark
skin tones that just looks really good
so I got in color number one you can opt
for the cause they have a wide variety
of color choices so you can just look
through it and pick what you want but
like I said this wig is currently on
sell for 2590 six guys so I definitely
recommend you go to DHS comm and check
this unit out it does come with two
combs right at the parting space right
here which I never use and it comes with
one big comb in the back and adjustable
straps so I just adjusted the straps and
put the wig on I didn't do anything
special to this unit guys I'm trying to
explain it to you the best way I can
this unit just came flawless out the
pack and all I did was add a little bit
of wet concealer on my parting space and
call it a day so this is the unit guys I
don't think that this one is heat friend
like oh it is heat friendly so it's heat
friendly up til 400 degrees so if you
want you can go in and if you don't like
the dip in the at the bottom you can
just go in lightly with your curling
your straightener and just kind of pull
it a little bit and it'll just be more
of like a blunt look and that actually
will look popping as well too so guys
I'm really pleased with this unit and
for the price is an excellent price I
don't always show you guys synthetic
units but I'm trying to show you guys
some synthetic units so you guys kind of
get like an idea of some looks for the
holidays even though the holidays are
wrapping up very shortly DHS does have
fast delivery you can do it overnight
delivery or the next day delivery and
you'll be just fine so guys I leave all
the information down below for you guys
