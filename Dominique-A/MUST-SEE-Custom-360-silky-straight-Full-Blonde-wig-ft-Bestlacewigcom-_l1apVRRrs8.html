today with another hair view but today's
hair feels different because today I
custom a unit blonde someone left in my
comments before they wanted to see me in
a full blonde unit so I said hey why not
so this week that I'm showing you guys
today is from art is from Beth's lace
wigs calm now this is a 360 unit that
they sent me it was originally 18 inches
long and it was a silky straight unit so
you do get your standard three combs
right here two on the side and one at
the base along with the comb in the back
and adjustable strap now you do get
about 4 inches of parting space in the
front and about two in the back now this
unit came to me black but I was like you
know I don't want to do black because I
do black all the time or natural color
so I went in at bleached the entire wig
and then I went in with dwelleth charms
218 to tone the hair so those are the
only things that I did I let it bleach
for about 30 minutes to 45 minutes and
left oh well it charms color on for an
hour now this is the call that I got and
it's kind of its kind of brassy in the
light right now but up close and
personal it's pretty poppin guys now
I've never done a full blonde unit
before so this is my first time so I
hope that you guys like this now what I
did for the parting space I went in with
like my brown my brow pencil and I went
and I just darken the roots a little bit
and a little bit in the front so what
I'm gonna do is put this baby on and
kind of play with the baby hairs in the
front and kind of make it look natural
it is kind of like a natural blow out
look I did go in and trim it and cut it
into like these washy cut-up layers I'm
not a professional so I just went in
just did like these little layers so I'm
gonna go in and kind of strain and bump
it out for you guys so you can see
exactly what it looks like I hope you
guys like this I kind of worked I worked
hard on this one I wanted to try
something different for my channel you
guys never seen me in full-on wig so
this would be the first time so I hope
you guys like the look so if you're
interested in seeing what this looks
like today guys I would like you to stay
tuned and keep on watching yeah I don't
know Padma
tell me what you want I give you all
that more
these will be private I will give you
all that more I might a feel of no white
I'm slow he's gonna be private
so this is the unit for best weeks calm
guys obviously it's not the original
unit I custom called this unit as I said
in the beginning of the video now this
unit guys is so so beautiful so I glued
the perimeter down just about right here
and then I kind of left this part the
way it was just because this part will
not be exposed now it did glue down
pretty well
now one thing with blond hair it's very
tricky when using got to be glue because
the hair almost melts into your skin so
I got to work on that factor what if it
got to the glue and glue and the baby
hairs down but I think so far I did a
pretty good job so I did go around and
do kind of like a really choppy cut with
this one just because I really didn't
know where the idea was going or where
the thought process is going I just
wanted to go and do something fun so I
did cut it into this kind of like bold
bob cut and then I did like these fun
layers all the way around and I went in
with my curling my straightener and
bumped the ends now I did do kind of
like a parcel sweet bang in the front
just because I don't really have these
with my units and I wanted to do
something that had like a little sweet a
baby sweep so I did that with this unit
and I think it looks cute it's very it
reminds me of like back in high school
and used to go to the hair salon and get
your hair blown on and then you have
that like nice cute little wrap so this
reminds me of a wrap but I really liked
it it - the blond part now there's this
whole stigmatism when black and wearing
blonde hair but I don't care someone
left a comment down below and said they
wanted to see me a blonde hair so I
decided to come and show you guys what I
look like with blonde hair so this is
what I consider a full bun unit I only
added a little bit of eyeliner pencil to
the root right here to kind of not to
roll you guys off too much because then
it would just not look realistic at all
so I add a little bit of brown eyeliner
at the parting space of this curved part
that I did and I guess it just kind of
make it a little bit better and I did
add some in the front here just so that
I didn't look like my hair was coming
out of nowhere so you got to understand
the job those kind of little fixtures
that you have to do when you're wearing
weights to make it look realistic for
those big bears and wig buyers out there
now I do love this one it is a bold
color so if you're not a bold person
beware I did die for I bleached it for
about 30 minutes and then I added the
well the charms t18 on it for about an
hour to tone it down I definitely go in
and tone it some more but I don't want
to process too much when I first got the
hair was a silky straight unit and once
I bleach it I noticed that the hair got
texture which I'm happy about because I
love a good textured wig so it
definitely has more of a swing to it a
bill to in a texture which I like so
sometimes bleach can be hell on earth
and sometimes bleach can work wonders so
I definitely feel like once I bleach the
hair the hair just gave me more life
that I wanted so I know that sounds
weird but that is what it is so yeah so
guys that's about it for this review
like I forgot to mention I don't got I
don't receive any shedding or tangling
so far so that's also a good thing so
we're wait to see what happens with this
unit because when you die here it kind
of likes to switch up on you but so far
I love it so guys do not forget to
