me
saying I have to go and come back today
with another wig review so in today's
review I'll be showing you guys the unit
from China Leslie's calm so I've worked
with them before and you guys know their
company is very very popular so the you
know I'm going to show you guys today is
this kinky straight unit now this unit
is 22 inches long and it's about a
hundred and fifty percent density it is
a lace front style unit and it is a
natural color and it is kinky hair now
it does come straight obviously and what
I'm going to do with this one is lightly
straighten it just so I can get it to
get this machine or this packaging dent
out now it does come with your standard
cap and it has three combs at the top
two on the sides and one at the base as
well as the comb in the back with
adjustable straps now I'm not going to
add in my adjust my elastic band to this
one just because the weight is a perfect
a good size and it fits well if you do
have a wig that doesn't fit so well just
add unless you've been on it but I won't
now just come with baby here's in the
front and the baby hands are
particularly long for my taste so I'm
going to go in and bleh them out a
little bit just so I can blend them and
make them look more natural now if
you're interested in seeing what this
unit looks like today guys I would like
you to stay tuned and keep online
Oh
you
away
not
all right guys oh my god like I'm so
cute so I would just like to start the
saying that I absolutely love this unit
now this is the unit that I will keep
like this is so bad and I'm so happy I
got in 22 inches that kind of thought if
I got into 1820 it just kind of women a
little bit short
the 22 inches is almost a 24 inch and it
looks so cute guys like I didn't do a
baby here crazy stuff this time just
because the hair texture is kinky so you
don't want to kind of do all that kind
of soft baby here look so I just knit a
little bit of it right here and then I
just tucked everything back I think I
could go on and add a hair pin just
because I didn't go this unit down this
time around so therefore I was lifting a
little bit on the side but once
everything is adjusted guys this unit is
like look at this guy's and as you guys
saw it didn't throw my identify iron it
just a little little bit just I can get
a little bit of the bumps and dips out
look at how nice this hair looks guys
look at the texture of the hair and like
I'm not really like a kinky hair type of
wear but this right here is so so nice
like I am so happy that I got this wig I
did receive a little bit shedding I
noticed when I was kind of strained in
here during this training process that
kind of like told a few strands out but
now that I'm just sitting here with you
guys I'm only getting like one strand
and stuff I'm not getting like a handful
I was getting before I'm not sure if it
was because I cut the lace and I
probably cut a little too close to the
line but since then it has stopped and
God that guy's a wastage now this is so
good like if you're someone who likes
that kind of natural textured look like
the african-american love this unit is
definitely for you guys I think that
this is so nice it is inexpensive guys
if you guys want to get like the 360 you
can go get the 360 high delays front now
the lage brought you only get about two
inches of parting space but what I like
to do with powders I kind of like to
extend
part a little bit into the cap so I
can't extend it to like about three
inches so that's another reason why I
use powder instead of concealer what
concealer to do my partying and to kind
of make my parts realistic just because
you can make you can disguise a lot with
the powder versus using the cream
concealer so that's just a side note to
let you guys know so if you want some
more party space try to 360 Archytas
fillets i think the lynchburg is perfect
it's inexpensive it is a nice 150%
density unit that is oh my god let me
show you guys how long how long this
unit is so it reaches just about to the
point of my bellybutton oh my god guys I
am so so pleased with this hair guys I
absolutely love it and this is one of
those units I will I won't sell and I
would keep this unit and I know you guys
ask me all the time about wick sales and
stuff like that I do have a wick cell
coming I'm just trying to gather my
things up so many things are like I have
so many projects that I'm doing so it's
getting crazy so thank you guys for
