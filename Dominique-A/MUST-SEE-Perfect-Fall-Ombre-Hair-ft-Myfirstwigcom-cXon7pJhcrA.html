so this is a unit from my first weeks
comm so this is a color number two and
number five so basically it's an ombre
style unit it is 18 inches long in it is
a yaki textured unit now I went for this
unit because it kind of was fall
inspired to me
I'm right here definitely is fall ish so
you can definitely do like a red ombre
or like a burgundy ombre or whatever
ombre so this is kind of like a
chocolate brown ombre and I think that
they did a really good job on the
coloring for this here so on the top
you'll get the number two right here and
then you'll get the five flowing down
and it's almost kind of like a blonde
brown look and I really like it
so what they did do to this unit is they
did kind of put layers in it so you kind
of get like a little bit of a bang area
area right here I opted not to cut it I
could have cut it more but if you're
putting curls in this type of unit it'll
give you more volume in the front if you
leave it the way it is so that's one
thing I like cuz it gave me more of a
swooping now if you strain this one I
believe it'll kind of be like right here
or right here and lengthwise so when you
do a middle part it'll actually look
nice because you'll have the hair kind
of come like that and then in layers so
that's one thing to keep in mind so as
far as the hairline goes they did a
really good job I think that the
hairline looks really good they did
bleach this wig so in the front area
you'll get a lot of bleached parts and
obviously I play with the hair right
here play at the baby here hair in a
little bit here they do do a really good
job pre plucking this unit so you don't
really have to do anything to this so
that's why this companies does
specialize in wigs for beginners so if
you're a beginner and you're new to this
kind of stuff these units are definitely
a step into the wig game like properly
so I didn't do that much to it but add
powder to it and part I had a powder to
it cut the baby here slightly and just
plop it on my head and glued it down
which you guys saw and then just adding
some fun layers to it just kind of curls
to it just kind of made it a little bit
more personal and if you're not into
curls you can just use it do it straight
it did come straight but I did go in and
put my own style to it like I usually do
and yeah so I do like this unit I will
list all the information down below for
you guys so you guys are interested in
purchasing this unit

friends and family and I will catch you
guys in the later one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
