what
oh great
all right guys Merry Christmas Happy
Holidays to everyone so this video today
is obviously a nice Christmas type of
look so this week was sent to me from
China lace wigs calm and if you ever go
on the website you'll notice that they
do have custom ombre styled units so
this is a custom green embrace tile unit
and it's like perfect for today and for
the holidays period so the only thing
that I did with this unit guys is just
tweeze this side I did cool it down I
didn't show that part but I do have a
video on my channel of me gluing my wig
down so I will insert that down below or
add it up here for you guys to just
click that to see how I glue my units
down but all I did with this one was
glue it down I only tweeze this side
right here because the hair is already
pre tweeze and trying to lace which does
a great job with pre tweezing the hair
for you so it already looks nice once
you take it out the box and put it on
your head so you really have to do that
much so I just tweeze here just because
it's the side where I kind of do a lot
of emphasis I did go in and add some
powder and I use the BH Cosmetics
contour palette it's the powder palette
to put the powder on my unit so I just
went in and just powdered the sides that
we're gonna have like skin exposure
along with cutting the baby hairs down
just a little bit and then kind of
making it look realistic so I do like
this hair a lot guys I did go with my
Diwali walk wan curl curling wand Wan
curl curling wand yeah so I went in with
my Duval and curling wand and I just did
I showed you that I curled one on this
side it's the same thing around I just
did a whole head of it and this is what
it looks like I just think that does
look so nice guys the unit was a 16 inch
so it's like the perfect length I don't
have to cut it or do anything crazy to
it sorry I did a curl on setting it and
I kind of like combs it out with my
hands just to kind of make it look more
fun and kind of give myself more of a
holiday glam but not too perfect of a
glam so you guys can see the bank
portion is really well like they did a
good job on the hair itself the hair is
very soft guys it's not dry it's not mad
at or any like thing that you can't deal
with so it's here that's really
manageable it did have like a slight of
kind of like a wavy look to it I think
the unit is supposed to be straight I'm
not sure if it's a water wave or some
like a body wave or wave but a deaf you
came with like this nice kind of like a
wet and wavy style to it when I first
got it but I didn't want to wear like
that just because it's Christmas and I
wanted to do something fun and kind of
like sexy sultry obviously my eyes are
like made up and stuff like that I'm
trying to be still Christmas tea right
now but I do like the hair I think it's
really nice and the green color that
they put on this is kind of like a dark
green so it's not one of those kind of
like bright greens were like people are
just gonna be looking like why so it's
one of those wearable greens so if they
added on this hair and they did a really
good job on brain this I think the color
job is really good they didn't go too
far up so they gave you a lot of black
at the top and then kind of went in I
got the right spot to do the ombre so
that's one thing I really really like
about this wig and it's just it's just
perfect
it is a 360 wig so you get lace in the
front and in the back I don't put in a
ponytail but if you want you can glue
the back down and do like a little mini
ponytail or something like that but I
have just to glue the side tabs out and
just a front part of the way and that's
it
so I do think that this is a nice unit
