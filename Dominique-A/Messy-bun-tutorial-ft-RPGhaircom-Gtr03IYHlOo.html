Thomas belly outside I don't want to
wait to drive souls which is leading us
it's obvious all will have a try yeah no
I don't always go through waistband
through the highways DOMA shadow to sun
rays and
Oh
ah
ha
along the way melodies we haven't played
now I don't wanna know
and I go in around these world and to
create a song I don't wanna miss be
we'll go through the wastelands through
the highways don't shadow to sunrays
will go
Oh
we were in number if you wanna see the
horizon sinister thousand and will grow
in number you'll see the horizon
we'll go
alright guys so I kind of did a quick
video today showing you guys how I style
my hand two buns now with lace front
360s full lace wigs lace wigs in general
you can kind of do a lot of different
styles with that now this is a lace
front wait but the fact of the matter is
that this wig is curly now what curly
hair you can manipulate a lot of styles
just because there's a lot of ways to
hide like imperfections in the way or
should not show parts that are kind of
funny so on the back what I did was I
use bobby pins to kind of like tuck
underneath the PAR the band part where
you'll be able to see and then I kind of
just played around with and just covered
it up with the hair now I didn't go
around the perimeter and just do a
little bit of baby hair stuff I consider
this one of my fun messy bum bun style
they used to do this with hoop earrings
and just kind of go with this one if I
want to do like a quick style I really
like this look just because it's simple
it's something different from wearing
long straight hair and just stuff like
that so I just thought with curly or
especially curly hair the density is not
a large density this one's from RPG here
guys I listed down below for you guys so
if you don't have a way that's a curly
unit that's a large density you can find
different ways to style the unit so this
one from RPG here is going to be my
bunny in it or kind of my like ponytail
unit I did not glue the front of the wig
down I just glued the baby hair down
which kind of solidified away and had it
and actually made to stay down so I
think that's a good thing I do really
like this one guys this is a nice curl
unit you just do up twos with I
personally when making my updo wig you
can choose to do whatever you want with
it as you saw in the beginning the way
you can do like a flip over look with it
or whatever but for the purposes of this
video and my look I'm going to make this
my bun way and it's just a fun messy bun
look that I came up with and I hope you
guys enjoyed it
