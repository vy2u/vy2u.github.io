tackles and she know the tacos weren't
that bad

disappointment like come on guys
but you know when it's all inclusive the
bus ate food and like that is
always nasty so it's to be expected from
these bozos but we have reservations for
like a steakhouse and a Brazilian
restaurant so hopefully those tastes

shortcut to the calving not like guys we

this okay so really important the
restrooms are married well restroom so
when you walk inside the cabin ladies to
the poor side left hand side lower back
couple reasons for you to use gentleman
walking
and
me

thanks to us a bag so nice
these handles make a lot of noise
real hard kind of man I like a little
place
yep anything okay
I'm hoping I can give us some nice food

french fries any longer guys I
just wanna for once I have the food here
is Wow look at my stage
so I'm having math cells and growth
chicken I will tell you guys later we're
going to we're going to send overview
about some tool here later just so that
you guys can get like a real gist of it
look at these things right they are real
pizza boy so that's all you need to see
right there to know what it is this is
this is probably the best thing that
they have is a nachos with the guac and
the grilled chicken for me was good but
and this was absolutely repulsive like
that Pizza is it's so congealed the
cheaters oppresses the noodle surprise
has ham and I don't eat pork and visit
oh my god it's like oil vinegar base
noodles gross the puff pastry is puff
and dry nasty so I will let you guys
know when we get back whenever we're
going to have a nice chat with you guys
unless you guys know the ins and outs of
this eating process
Oh watch some people they are
Oh
well
overall experience at this place
so what are the pros suppose is the
beach the pool
the room was nice that are beautiful now
head is with the major con the food I
thought the food was edible so why are
you speaking so properly right now this
leads out of all I am laughing at wind
but come on it was edited last night
when I come on make sure I go on
vacation for good and although the bear
wasn't going to do it very edible
I have no explanation to the food I knew
what happened that was a weird I
expected more like Mexican food which it
wasn't there was no great goose here
there's no honey no that's mixed three
the mimosas mix with tang rasa first the
first one they got that orange juice
from Walmart and then the rest it was
 tank powder tangos disgusting
was - it was horrible stinking and let's
talk about the stairs oh I don't think
they beat the locals I don't think
they've ever seen two actresses for so
they were scaring but I think some of
the tourists our Americans today were
friendly because they Steve idea that
Americans were front the Europeans the
Euro know what we were yeah I don't
think - this home right here but the
Europeans had no clue who we were before
dress everybody's gone flat for us
they've never seen dress before so they
stared at me like all hell and I was
like one woman one year pain Wilma
scared me down I was so confused like
that I was more fastening device oh no
one spear with a minor head like that
she said anyway like say something and I
was trying to be trying to be nice I'm
not trying to show my blacks I know
but I'm half like these people are crazy
in but also far so that we're at the
beach now and we got this one of the
real question is which I would come back
if I had all reservations and if I had
all reservations I will come back but
like now when they switch it to one
reservation who's about to do that
that's no you would never come back but
what's gonna be better than this this
was nice I don't hear anybody we had up
trade for one of the like grands the
Hellion cell bar like I did a grant of
Baja principle we have an edge really
what the I was gonna forget but we
still had to reservation I do everyone
this is an hour how come it was sleeping
y'all was sleeping that's one yeah no I
woke up done else's hard it was a long
day coconuts army hopefully none of
these iguanas come out of so they're
scary he's in the white bottom it's
coming soon making our way over here put
off the Omo uemura's office oh you're so
funny
and she comes the sloth tables a sloppy
it's run in the white and black and two
things that something did I not make my
point
this is can block yeah beautiful eyes
