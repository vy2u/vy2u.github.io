stopping by today to do a giveaway and
this giveaway sponsored by a company
called walk with style fashion and
things and the company's owner is
actually on YouTube she has a YouTube
channel and her YouTube channel is Miss
Black Diamond 101 so if you check our
YouTube channel you can see in her doing
updates on her products and other
people's products
she's a YouTube guru beauty guru as well
so she does a lot of reviews for
companies as well but she actually has
her own company which is really good so
she um has a website and you can go on
the website and check out all her
products they're very affordable she not
only has hair I mean she not only has
low obvious I said here but she not only
has jewelry but she has hair and
accessories a lot of things like that so
it's a pretty different website because
there's a wide variety of items to buy
which is really nice and said it is
going to here it's a website that only
has hair or website that only has a
jewelry which is kind of corny she
incorporates everything together has to
do with beauty so I mean that's really
cool um but I will send this to the
winner because it obviously as you guys
know this is a giveaway and I will send
one of these cards to the winner so they
know all the information and as you can
tell all the information is listed on
this card itself she's really nice to
pack it came in when like I think a
couple days she asked me if I want you
to review and a couple days later do all
the packages came in real fast
she sent me three items to review for
you guys and I'll be giving away two of
the items I will not tell you guys what
I'm gonna actually give away to you guys
I'm just gonna send it away and then you
guys will get it and you guys will be
happy okay guys okay so starting off I'm
just opening the package as is I didn't
really open it while I kind of flip this
one over everything now but I didn't
really open it to see exactly what they
look like from touch or feel I'm just
looking at the plastic but we'll start
off with this one and I'm not sure this
is a belt or whatever but I'll probably
check them you can check out the website
to find out really the exact specs I
will list all the information down below
in all the specs I'm alone
itself and all the things you guys needs
to know about the giveaway itself too by
the way so this is the item that I got
and it's like a really cute I'm not sure
if it's like a it could be like a neck
necklace but like a bracelet or I think
it's kind of like one of those waist
bells but I'm very curvy and this will
not fit around my waist like I have like
a waist waist so this won't fit guys so
I will send this out to someone I would
tell you guys now that this will be
sound everything else you guys have to
wait but this is one of the items it's
really cute it's like a animal print
style kind of about it's kinda it's like
a plasticy leather feel on the top of it
it has like this really cute embroidery
um bow tie which is really nice it's
very sturdy so it's not like this I'm
gonna just pop off on you when you're
wearing it and it's pretty long um for
someone that probably has like a smaller
waist I don't have a small waist so this
won't you know fit my waist but for
someone who has a small waist is
probably be really nice for you to pair
off and to wait for the holiday seasons
and even if you don't turn this contest
and you do end up winning if you don't
want any of these products Christmas is
right around the corner or so you can
just give it away as a present or a gift
to someone else would appreciate it
other than you um but this is really
nice I like the design and I like the
shine the little shimmer right here oh
this is so cute umm I like the little of
design and shine on it it's really
pretty so like I said this will be given
away but I will tell you guys what else
is I'm gonna give away because clearly
this is not gonna fit me the next item
that I've found well that I got is this
cute little orange bracelet and this
orange bracelet has like a really nice
like rhinestones on top of it which is
really cute and it's a stretchable
bracelet sages abstraction and put it on
your arm which I like so if you don't
have a like skinny arm this this will
stick to its part it's basically one of
those kind of one size fits all kind of
items which is really nice so you're not
struggling to put something on so this
is how you put it on its really it's
really cute so it's really cute it's a
nice fashion statement I really like
this is actually pretty pretty cute guys
it's like a really nice fashion piece
very good fashion
it's a fashion statement um I actually
like this so it's really nice and I I
kind of feel like these are um a little
dot the little diamonds on it are very
secure so it's not like they're just
gonna like pop off or anything I thought
which is really cute and you can see the
shimmering shininess of it when I slash
it with the camera this is pretty guys
so this can be a possibility for you
guys but everything like this guys so
this is another item that I got and like
I said three items so this will be the
last one I'm gonna show you guys and
last but not least this is the last one
and she actually sent me a whole
necklace and earrings back this is
actually really really pretty I didn't
like this I like the gold detail and I'm
a gold wear so any bit of gold that I
see is like having to me so this is
really nice it has like gold up lighting
it has all these different types of them
well too well oh we like the set of
shapes circles and then this like
octagon or whatever you guys so you guys
tell me kind of shape this is I'm not
gonna be geometric right now so tell me
what kind of shape that is and it has
like these little two diamond earrings
on it to match which is really nice it
does have the adjustable like adjuster
and money so you can adjust it to the
length that you wanted so it's really
easy it's really pretty too it's a nice
coral color I'm pretty sure you can wear
this for Easter or anytime you want to
you can't really it's people say there's
like winter college and stuff like that
it's whatever you feel color that's how
I feel so you can wear this in the
winter you can wear this for Easter you
can wear this for New Year's it's a
holiday piece it's a statement piece you
can do whatever you want with it I'm
pretty sure I'm not sure she has any
other colors but I'm pretty sure you
check out our website you can see oh she
has any other colors this would also
look gorgeous in an orange color or
probably like a blue color like a royal
blue color which would be really pretty
so check that one as well
