you can go on the website and check out
all her products they're very affordable
she not only has hair I mean she not
only has low obvious i sent here but she
not only has jewelry but she has hair
and accessories a lot of things like
that so it's a pretty different website
because there's a wide variety of items
to buy which is really nice and said it
is going to here's a website that only
has hair or website that only hands
jewelry which is kind of corny she
incorporates everything together has to
do with beauty so I mean that's really
cool um but i will send this to the
winter because it obviously as you guys
know this is a giveaway i will send one
of these cards to the winter so they
know all the information and as you can
tell all the information is listed on
this card itself um she's really nice to
pack it came in when like I think a
couple days she asked me if I want you

happy okay guys okay so starting off I'm
just opening the package as is i didn't
really open it while I kind of flip this
one over everything now but I didn't
really open it to see exactly what they
look like from touch or feel I'm just
looking at the plastic but we'll start
off with this one and I'm not sure this
is a bell or whatever but i'll probably
check them you can check out the website

will list all the information down below
in all the suspect stumble on items
itself and all the things you guys need
to know about the giveaway itself too by
the way so this is the item that i got
and it's like a really cute I'm not sure
prince aikka it could be like a necklace
but like a bracelet or I think it's kind
of like one of those waist belts but um
I'm very curvy and this will not fit
around my waist like I have like a waist
wait
so this won't fit guys so i will send
this out to someone i would tell you
guys now that this will be sound
everything else you must have to wait
but this is one of the items it's really
cute it's like a animal print style kind
of about it's kinda it's like a plasticy
leather feel on the top of it it has
like this really cute embroidery um bow
tie which is really nice it's very
sturdy so it's not like this image just
pop off on you when you're wearing it
and its pretty long um for someone that
probably has like a smaller waist I
don't have a small waist so this won't
you know fit my lease but for someone
like a small waist is probably be really
nice for you to pair off and away the
holiday seasons and even if you enter in
this contest and you do end up winning
if you don't want any of these products
Christmas is right around the corner or
so you can just give it away as a

little of design and shine on it it's
really pretty so like i said this will

um the next item that I found well that
I got is this cute little orange
bracelet and this orange bracelet has
like a really nice like nine songs on
top of it which is really cute and it's
a stretchable bracelet so you to
distraction and put it on your arm which
I like so if you don't have a skinny
arms this this will stick to its part
it's basically one of those kind of
one-size-fits-all kind of items which is
really nice so you're not struggling to
put something on so this is how you put
on it's really really cute so it's
really cute it's a nice fashion
statement I really like this is actually
pretty pretty cute guys it's like a
really nice fashion piece very
fashionable state fashion statement oh I
actually like this so it's really nice
and I kind of feel like these um the
little dot the little diamonds on our
very secure so it's not like they're
just gonna like pop off or anything I
thought which is really cute and you can
see the shimmering shininess of it when
I splash it with the camera oh this is
pretty guys so this can be a possibility
for you guys whatever like this
so this is another item that I got and
like I said three items so this will be
the last one I'm going to show you guys
last but not least this is the last one
and she actually sent me a homo necklace
and earring set um this is actually
really really pretty I didn't like this
I like the gold detail and I'm a gold
where so any bit of gold that I see is
like having to me so this is really nice
it has like gold outlining and has all
these different types of them well too
well only like a set of shapes circles
and this like octagon or whatever you
guys do you guys tell me kind of shape
this is I'm not going to be geometric
right now so tell me what kind of shape
that is and um it has like these little
to diamond earrings on it to match which
is really nice it does have the
adjustable um like adjust their money so
you can adjust it to the link that you
wanted so it's really easy it's really
pretty too it's a nice coral color I'm
pretty sure you can wear this for Easter
or anytime you want to you can't really
its people say there's like winter
colors and stuff like that it's whatever
you feel color that's how I feel so you
can wear this in the winter you can wear
this for each to equal windows for new
years it's a holiday piece it's a
statement piece you can do whatever you
want with it I'm pretty sure I'm not
sure she has any other colors but i'm
pretty sure you check out our website
you can see if she has any other colors
this would also look gorgeous in an
orange color or probably like a blue
color like a royal blue color which
would be really pretty so check that one
