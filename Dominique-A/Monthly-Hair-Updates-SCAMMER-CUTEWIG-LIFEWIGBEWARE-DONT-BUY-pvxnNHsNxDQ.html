today with a monthly update video so by
the time you see this video guys that
actually be made first but I have a lot
of stuff to do it is finals week so if
somebody guys know went back to school
so I have a lot of stuff going on so I'm
coming a little bit late but it's okay
so by the time this video hits this
month should bring a lot of fun videos
for you guys I'm starting to do a lot of
customizations and stuff like that a lot
of celebrity inspired looks so you guys
will see a lot of more interesting
videos definitely summer friendly type
hairstyles and spring friendly type
hairstyles so I hope you guys enjoyed
this month may of the fun-filled videos
that I'm gonna provide so backflash to
April guys so I didn't really review a
lot of wigs in April and apricot it's
tried it a little bit lightly just
because I was SuperDuper busy coming
back from a trip and then starting back
and doing stuff was a lot but I did
review some great wigs now in this video
I'm also gonna put out a disclaimer not
even a disclaimer I just want to point
this out I'm gonna do it now because it
makes it easier to get into the video
now a lot of people have been sending me
messages on DMS on Instagram snapchat
and on here they leave in the comment
section you guys will leave in the
comment section that you haven't seen
companies advertising my pictures in my
videos as theirs now if you're
subscribed to my channel you know 100%
of what I provide and even if you don't
I would say to you guys to do your
research before purchasing anything a
lot of these like cute wigs a life like
something wig I'll list all the names of
the wig companies down below do not buy
hair from these companies guys they're
selling wigs that I review that are damn
near $150 to $300 and they're selling
for $30.00 and I'm not saying no one's
stupid like if I was someone that did
not know I would actually purchase it
with myself so I'm giving you guys a
heads up right now that if you do not
see a review on my channel and if
there's no review on my channel in
regards to that unit that they're
claiming is the one that I'm reviewing
then don't buy the wig and it's annoying
because I'm not the only one that they
still peek Mills videos they still
raving at Lisa's pictures and all that
kind of stuff and I just so happened to
be throwing in that pile too and when I
saw it I was like why I just don't
understand that why are they stealing
and then lying and saying that this is
it I'm letting you guys know right now
do not bother hair from these
companies I don't work for those
companies there lie they steal my stuff
and then plastered all over the internet
as if you know it's my product mind you
using mice my videos the ones that I
worked hard for and that didn't pay me
commission for using my videos to kind
of broadcast and sell their products and
then I feel bad because a lot of people
are mad because they're purchasing the
wig based off of a fake review that
doesn't belong to that wig and thinking
that they're gonna get the same exact
product that i'm featuring which is
completely bogus so i will link down the
names of the companies down below and i
don't care if they see this video
because i don't work with you so i don't
care do not buy wigs from any of these
companies on facebook
there are fraud companies they still
youtube's pictures they still youtubers
videos and frolic around as if their
products are genuinely the products that
we're reviewing so it still lacks I'm
gonna say this I wish I had like a
management team that could help me
dispute all that kind of stuff the only
thing that I really do is try to tell
you guys encourage you guys to help me
out and just report it as spam cuz I've
noticed that when I chat when I've done
that recently they've actually been
deleting them so um if we can work as a
team guys because I am doing this by
myself no one notices I manage this
whole entire thing that I'm doing by
myself so I'm really trying to work on
trying to get that all that kind of fake
stealing products stealing pictures
stealing video type thing like I'm
trying to dead that right now so um if
you do report a span thank you so much
for helping me out but like I said guys
this is the only time I'm addressing
this I want to say thank you to everyone
who did reach out to me to let me know
that these companies were stealing my
stuff but I'm telling you guys right now
coming from my mouth the person who
created these videos do not buy the hair
from these trash ass companies like I
don't like just the fact that they have
to steal my stuff to lie just tells you
straight off the back that this stuff is
not good so if you don't see the video
on my channel guys do not buy the hair
don't buy it at all alright guys so
moving along into more of a positive
side I'm sorry that I got angry in the
beginning but it's just something I
wanted to address so I had to get out in
this video just because moving forward I
want to make sure that everyone trusts
my wig reviews and they like actually
watch my videos and make sure they pay
attention to what I'm reviewing because
a lot of these companies are super fake
and they're super super like messed up
stealing people's money is not the way
to go
so I didn't like I said to you guys I
didn't really review that many wigs this
month I kind of added like a lot of a
lot of different things in my videos
this month so I did add makeup tutorials
so it kind of took over a little bit of
my hair view but you still got videos on
Wednesdays and stuff but like I said
this season this month and May June July
I have some different videos for you
guys and I actually think you guys are
gonna really really enjoy what I have so
just stay tuned for that so I'm gonna
kind of jet back you guys know I review
a lot of the wigs for my first wigs so I
did review an ombre style wig in the
beginning now a beginning of the month
now that ombre style week is that one of
the new wigs they have on their website
so that wig guys I did like but I did
mention to you guys in the video that
the hair was SuperDuper dry at the ends
I think it's because of their processing
so I did tell you guys that the hair was
SuperDuper dry so I did call wash the
hair and I have not done anything to it
but I every single person loved that
here and I loved that here too I think
that their Umbra job on that particular
wig was excellent guys so I do think
that if you do dip conditioned the hair
and kind of let it really saturate in
that the dryness at the ombre area we're
definitely diminished
I did Co wash mine for about I'm not Co
wash it I do condition it for a day and
I kind of feel like I see a huge
difference in the wig so that's one
thing now that we got link it down below
and I'll also attach the cards up here
so you guys know exactly what unit I'm
talking about now the next thing I did
was do a couple of I'm doing a lot of
bundle videos guys so the next unit that
I created was from Wiggins hair company
now they sent me straight bundled hair
and they sent me four bundles in a
frontal now that video was a little bit
of a challenge for me guys just because
the but the frontal was super boxy now
Wiggins hair if you guys saw me review
that nice natural and now I'm gonna say
this everyone gets upset it's a natural
wave I don't know why I said curly in
that particular video but I kept trying
to correct it on the bottom in the
comments so that hair is a natural wave
textured hair and I believe it's
Malaysian so I will specify that again
natural wave Malaysian so even if you go
on Wiggins hair on Aliexpress you can
actually find that specific natural wave
Malaysian honestly texture wise
Malaysian Peruvian Brazilian it's all
the same I don't it's all the same guys
it's just a name like I'm being
completely honest Peruvian prison come
on the only hair that's a little
different is Chinese Chinese here's a
little bit thicker but Peruvian and
Malaysian Brazilian I saw the same so
don't go don't get crazy with the height
so one thing about the Wiggins here
company guys I like their wavy pattern
here I do have a curly hair that I'm
gonna review the next month this month
for you guys so I'm really excited about
that but as far as it's straight here I
feel like I had better straight here
from other companies so I'm not gonna
say to guys to just jump right out and
go buy that hair I kind of feel like
I've had better straight here from other
companies especially this one that I'm
always rocking that you guys asked me
this one is actually from Virgo hair
company and these are bundles as well
with a frontal I've actually feel like
I've had better so the Wiggins hair
company it's nice but I feel like that
hair has its own might of its own so
when I try to style it one way I feel
like the hair tries to do its own thing
which I'm not into but it's a wig that
like I said you gotta kind of wear for a
while like I feel like the older the wig
is the better it is so this bundle here
is definitely a type of hair I feel like
after a few wears it'll just get better
but just for some reason I kind of feel
like I've had better straight hear
better straight hair now the next time I
reviewed guys was the West kissed hair
like I said I've been doing a lot of
this like hair review but no reviews now
the West kiss hair guys on the low it's
cute now this was their kind of loose
wave textured hair now I would say three
bundles and a front toe now I really
like this hair guys now let me straight
to you that's why I like this hair it's
SuperDuper soft the curls the loose
weight loose weight loose wave is super
super soft and bouncy guys Aiko wants it
and let it air dry and it was just so
freakin plush after I absolutely loved
that loose wave texture I'm really into
the natural wave loose wave textures
because they're almost a curl and
they're almost a wave this one from West
kiss here guys I'm not gonna lie it's
hands-down poppin
I do wish that the company would have
sent me four bundles instead of three
because I have this thing where if it's
kind of those texture hairs and I can
see a gap in the back I'm just over it
like I feel like when I'm making my wigs
they have to be four bundles and higher
even though they'll I did get my longest
length was 24 inches and I just kind of
felt like 24 22 20 and then a 20 inch
frontal for me I need four bundles so I
need to 24s 120 to 120 and a 20 inch
front row so that's the organized
the lengths that I usually like but they
only sent me three had I had another
bundle it would have been a pal I do
like that haired so I really I really
recommend checking out their loose wave
here definitely perfect here guys
for like a vacation so Wiggins here in
West kiss hair their loose wave texture
natural wave texture or their curly
textures are a 1 now the next week that
I review that you guys love now this was
that coral style way people now this one
is from Ray's signature hair now this
website this is not even a website
she has an Instagram and I mentioned
that to you guys before and it kind of
sucks because not everyone has Instagram
so there are some other companies out
there guys that do hats l braided wigs
and I'll link them down below for you
guys I think once called Sylvia hair and
I was thing about purchasing one from
some from her she got some pop and
braided wigs so definite chucks Sylvia
here she's also Nigerian based as well
too so she sells all those braided style
units when I tell you guys I freaking
love that braided wig number one this
month for me wait wait wait wait it's on
the list of the number one that wig was
happen it still is like I don't like I
think like every makeup look goes well
with that that wig was constructed so
well I did complain a little bit about
like a little bit of a bulkiness at the
top but then after when I really went at
the unit it's perfect guys I really like
that unit so if you're interested in
just getting a wig that's already braids
instead of getting your own hair done
definitely look into purchasing custom
units that are created braided style
that wig guys is hands-down one of my
favorite units of the month
now the next unit that I review guys is
a really kinky oh I didn't review that
next I reviewed some wigs from double
leaf wig one from double leaf wig and it
was like a really super kinky style
textured wig now that wig I'm actually
gonna put on sale on my wig cell which
will be coming in like two weeks so it's
a really super duper kinky hairstyle you
guys loved it now I'm not someone that
super duper kinky hairstyle I'm not like
I like it but sometimes it could be too
much but that hair is super soft guys it
has a great parting space it looks very
natural
I don't bleach my um wigs I just add
powder and I felt like that one really
melted into my skin really nicely so
even without bleaching the knots on
wig it would just look amazing it's like
and that wig is super kinky curly guys
it's like super big and it's like about
150% density and it was just great now
the key to that one it is definitely a
360 wig guy so if you want to do kind of
like a really nice top like kinky bun it
will look so amazing with that so that's
definitely something I think that you
guys should look into
now the next one that I review is from
oMG her hair now I work from Giri here I
liked that company I've worked the fur I
think in the first review that I did
when I started really putting videos out
was with them and I did a straight way
after I did a video with them I really
started liking doing this more so I kind
of was into doing reviews so the way
that I reviewed for them was this a
really kinky straight hair now that wig
look so real like what I mean so real
that would look absolutely real guys and
actually I am going to put that on sale
as well too so I'll link it up here for
you guys now I like kinky straight here
guys but that was a can case right here
and I just kind of feel like with me
it's kind of like one of those wigs I
honestly would wear like once in a while
so why not give it I'll put it on sale
so I'm gonna actually list that one on
sale a lot of you guys really like that
texture it is super real looking like it
looks like it's like the perfect amount
of debt it's the perfect density it's
it's huge but it's like huge with the
purpose which I always say like it has
to be big with the purpose so the
purpose of that one being big is that it
looks gorgeous is like the hairline is
pre plucked it's just it's just such a
nice wig guys so I'm definitely put that
on my WIPs website as for a wig sale or
my next week sale because you guys love
that wig and I want to give the
opportunities for someone to buy it
because I'm not gonna wear that one as
much as I would wear like my other
straight ones now the next week that I
did review was from China lace wigs and
you guys know it was one of my top 5 as
well a lot of these are actually my top
5 so it's kind of ironic that my top
fives ended up being the ones that I
review more frequently they do provide a
lot of wigs so therefore it's just kind
of something that I like to do now China
lace weeks came out with a new wig it's
called the dream Swiss lace wig now that
one guys I kind of feel like the dream
Swiss lace wig and the regular Swiss
lace is the same thing don't get caught
up in the the name guys I would say look
at the price so both way this one was
I'm not gonna lie though I already said
this before my China lace wigs
pree plug game is number one I've never
seen a pre plug game so intense and so
great that unit guys I only put a little
bit of it it melted into my skin like
butter like I that one and listen it's
it they did sales 200% density and I
told you guys in that video hail to the
nah that is not a 200% density I know
200% density because the only company
that I've worked with that has a great
200% density is perfectly swings calm
now this one was like 150 but they try
to get away with the 200 don't listen to
that because it's not know as far as the
wig itself the best part about these
units is the how realistic the hairline
is you cannot tell me that we didn't
love real it was beautiful
added a little bit of powder on it even
if you bleach that baby it will come off
so fly but all I do is add powder on it
and I was good to go guys definitely
natural great look but like I said when
you're purchasing this particular wigs
from China lace wigs they're saying
dream Swiss lace and then Swiss lace I'm
telling you guys keeping down hundred
percent it's just a price look at the
price they all the same don't even get
hype on the honesty two different it I
really didn't see a difference from the
other wigs I reviewed that our Swiss
lace from them I honestly felt like it
was the same thing so keep that in mind
keep that in mind now the last week that
I think this is the last week I'm not
like running through my phone to see
what I have so the last week was a wig I
reviewed about like six days ago on last
week Wednesday and it was the hair from
let's see from here Vivi now I did a
start to finish on that video and I was
really proud of that video guys just
because I kind of try to do different
formats
now that here I told you guys that they
over bleached the hair I feel like this
company should not bleach and people
have left comments saying that their
unit came bleach - I don't necessarily
think they should provide the service if
they can't provide a good service so if
you don't know how to bleach Knox just
don't do it because people are spending
money on something that you it for a
service that you can't provide it makes
no sense to do that however I did like
the construction the width I did like
the color I did say I was a little iffy
about in the beginning but after I wore
the wig for that five days and I even
wore it like two days later making it a
complete week I'm not gonna lie guys I
really like that way hundred percent of
the way the style everything about it
the way
girl the way I formed the curls and
everything I was absolutely in love with
that wig but like I said if I was a
company and I was getting complaints
from people saying that you bleached a
hair over bleached hair I would never
provide a service like that I even think
someone said that they may charge like
$15 for bleaching why am I paying you 15
knots to bleach something you don't know
how to bleach does that even make sense
so sorry here baby but do not bleach
hair if you don't know how to bleach
hair like not even bleach err bleach
knots don't bleach knots if you don't
know how to bleach knots did I say
bleach knots dumb get it right
so I kind of feel like bleaching not to
them is not something they're good at
and they shouldn't provide that service
if they're not good at it and then
charging $15 for a service you can't
even complete come on people that just
doesn't make any sense at all alright
guys so that face keep wraps up today's
video I hope you guys enjoyed today's a
monthly update I will continue to do
these monthly updates for you guys
because you guys asked me for updates on
these units I'm sorry that the beginning
of this video was a little bit of a rant
but I wanted to make sure I address that
because a lot of you guys have been
messaging me and letting me know about
all this fraudulent stuff going on so I
want to say thank you so much for
