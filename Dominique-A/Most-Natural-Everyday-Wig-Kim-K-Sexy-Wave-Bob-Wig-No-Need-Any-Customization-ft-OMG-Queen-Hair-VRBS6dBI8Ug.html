of the way from OMG Queen hair now you
guys i religiously work with this
company guys cuz honestly i love their
freakin units they have a wide variety
of units on their website so you're
always gonna find something like you're
never gonna be disappointed and they're
pretty priced pretty well guys so i
definitely recommend that you shop on
this website
now this wig is there sexy kim k styled
unit guys it's 12 inches long and it is
a lace front wig now you do get a
section of lace in the back that is
perfect for gluing down so this is not a
360 but they did provide that little
patch in the back that i'm always raving
about that you can actually glue down
and put this in a ponytail or do kind of
like up styles with it so that's
definitely something to look up with
this company they definitely know how to
hit the trends right and they know how
to give you exactly what's going to work
with your unit so I was definitely
impressed when I saw that and they
definitely added an elastic band as well
to this so if it's kind of too big or
too small
you can definitely adjust it with the
elastic band to make it fit your head
properly so I definitely appreciate that
they did that as well now as far as
styling the hair guys all I did was go
in with my deep waver and kind of
amplify the front up on a strop I only
was stroked it Ali went through it one
time in the front right here and on the
side and that's all I needed
I does have a great wave pattern and the
link is nice I'll turn around and show
you guys what it looks like so it was
perfect I just AM extra so I wanted to
go in and just try to make it a little
bit more buff in the front and more wavy
so that the whole entire texture was
like in unison if you know what I mean
but I definitely like it now and I liked
it before guys it's very very soft guys
very super buttery soft hair it's very
lightweight and I definitely think that
this is a perfect way for spring and
summer you can't go wrong with this it's
like a fresh wavy wig fresh simple wig
guys you didn't have to do too much to
it already came perfect out the box and
it's just kind of like okay what else do
I need to do nothing so I did go in and
put a little powder around the perimeter
and just cut the baby hairs up and just
kind of
little sugar and spice to it just to
make it look nice but like I said guys
you don't have to go an extra mile with
this unit it came perfect and this is
what it is
so guys i'll leave the information down
below if you're interested in purchasing
this unit from OMG clean hair now don't
