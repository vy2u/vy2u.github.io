from RPG here calm now this wig is a
natural color 12 inch length bob style
wig the density on this week is about
150% so it is a nice size density now on
this wig I will link down everything
down below if you guys are interested in
purchasing this wig so basically I'm
going to do today put the wig on my head
I'm just going to strand it out a little
bit so I can get that middle part kind
of sweet Bob look it is a very nice
suede guys the texture this wig is
almost like an african-american textured
style wig it is 12 inches all around and
it is a very very nice well-constructed
unit now this has about four inches of
parting space at the top right here it
comes with two combs on the side one
come at the base and one at the back
with an adjustable strap like your basic
regular old way so what I'm going to do
is keep this in the middle part style
and then just struttin it out and show
you guys what it looks like on my head
this wig is kind of Windows minimal ways
with you it's already styled so you just
have to kind of add your justice to it
so it's not really like too much work
for this unit they did pretreat the end
the edges while the edges the hairline
so it looks very very realistic and very
very natural which is one of my favorite
things about this company so if you guys
are interested in seeing what this bob
looks like today I would like you to
stay tuned and keep online
alright guys so this is what the unit
looks like once I've straightened it add
some powder on it and just put it on my
head I really do like this unit guys
just because it is a lightweight it is
150% density but you don't really get
too much of a heavy feel I think that
the cut that they did on this unit is is
excellent like this looks really good
it's like blunt cut through straight I
actually prefer one side being tucked in
just because when it's down together it
looks a little bit flat so I was trying
to avoid that like a flat effect like
this maybe because my outfit should have
been a little bit different for this
hairstyle but for now I will just tuck
one behind my ear one side behind my ear
just to give myself that kind of like a
soft sultry kind of look in a way kind
of sexy but I think that this is cute
let me turn around and show you guys
what the back looks like hopefully I
strained it out in the back enough ok so
that's what the back looks like guys
they did a terrific job with this cut on
this unit you don't have to do anything
to it you just have to strain it out
curl it out do whatever you want to
design it out whatever you're going for
you need to do that first make sure you
open the parting space a little bit by
actually combing it through I didn't
tweezer pluck anything I left it the way
it was I just opened it up with the comb
and then added some powder to to make it
look more realistic now I will link down
