people so this is the finished look of
this unit so this unit guys was sent to
me from OMG Queen here calm so this is a
light yaki style on BA angled Bob now
you guys can see how luscious this unit
is it's definitely a really really
pretty style now Bob season is
definitely summer season so I'm gonna be
revealing a lot of nice bobs I'm gonna
try to customize some Bob's for you guys
like do highlights and kind of do full
colored units as well so stay tuned for
that now this unit guys I really think
is a really nice unit now this one did
come with an adjustable strap attached
to the unit that the company did
themselves which is really cool so for
the purposes of this video guys I did
not glue this unit down at all the only
Google that I used was for the baby
hairs and that was that now this unit
fits my head very nice guys it fits
perfect and I honestly feel like it's
like it's almost like a glueless cap
honestly so with the adjustable strap
being adjusted on this one it's almost
like a glueless clap and it fits so nice
and sleek like you guys can see that
look at that look at how sleek this unit
is so one thing that I had to do with
this unit that was a little bit of a
different thing for me it is a yaki
texture so I did get a lot of bulkiness
in the top right here so what I had to
do is take my tweezers go into this
section right here where the lace is
still at and kind of pluck some of the
hair out the hair is a thicker texture
so I was getting too much of a bulky
look up here and I didn't like that cuz
it just kind of looks funny it's like
bulky up here and then straight and
sleek at the bottom so all I did was go
in blind with my tweezers and just pull
the hair from this area and usually when
I do that just kind of like scatter my
hand up and just pull there's not really
a method to that for me I just kind of
go in and when I see it kind of dimmed
down a little then I know that it's
prepared and ready that it's not bulky
anymore another thing I did do guys I
switched apart I switched the part
because I don't like the manufactures
part that they do it just doesn't look
real and it almost has this kind of like
a really really light color to it I
don't know if they add like a little
like a coat or something on it to make
it light I just don't like that so I
just went in and I spray the unit and it
did like a curved part now I did use my
instant freeze from Aussie just to kind
of lay it down I dig all my curling iron
I press it down for a few minutes
to kind of get it sleek you guys can see
that that parting space is very
realistic very flat and very happen now
I did go into the front section like I
usually do and because I was doing a
curved part I went into this section
right here and I started tweezing hair
out so therefore when I do the baby
hairs in this section actually looks so
real and it doesn't look kind of funny
coming out of nowhere now I did go in
and do what my little frees up right
here and just kind of let the hair rise
up this way usually I like to do that
with I'm gonna have curls but sometimes
with straight here it looks good if you
got to pull the hair up and then have
the hair come down I don't know that's
been kind of like my signature thing to
do now I just like it just having like a
little bit elevation or units even if
it's not curling it straight it just
gives them hair like more of a realistic
look so that was what I was trying to
achieve so guys I will leave all the
information down below if you're
interested in purchasing this beautiful
bob way from OMG Queen hair calm
