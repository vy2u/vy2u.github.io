gonna get this video today but I'm just
coming today just to do an update on my
blue hair and this hair was said to me
for a review from a company called
beauty forever here for a lease bus um
the hair did not come this color guys if
you watched my previous videos before I
did do initial video training as a hair
and how am I styled it in the video and
the color and everything like that and
so I've been asked like a thousand
questions from you guys so I decided to
come today and just give you guys a kind
of a little bit of an update on my hair
and the color everyone's like wondering
like what color it is and stuff like
that I will list all the links for the
hair my last video and any other things
you guys need to know down below so if
I'm missing something you'll find it
down below um I usually do that
sometimes for you guys just in case you
forgot or you didn't hear what I said in
the beginnings just so you know all the
information you need for this hair and
my pants video for this hair will be
linked down below in the description box
so um as far as the spectacle I'm really
not I can't remember off the top of my
head right now but I think I was set a
10-inch closure a 10-inch closure a
10-inch 10 of 12 inch but on a 14-inch
bundle of hair I will list them
somewhere below it somewhere on the
screen um the specs of the hair and
everything for you guys but I did get
the hair in a shorter length this time I
usually get really long hair like 20 to
24 and 26 inches but this time since it
was a summertime I decided to do
something shorter it was a little bit
longer this pneus if you look at my last
video so i did go and i just kind of
gave it like a little bit of a not a
blunt couple just looking a little uh
kind of sort of like a blunt cut just
above the breast area I wanted something
just to be short and fun where I can
just curl it and then just puff it up
and just go because that's kind of a
style that I like what I'm transitioning
to the fall season the hair color is
still the same color it was in the
beginning it's like an ombre blue it's
very blue with the atomic turquoise and
the rockabilly blue and I believe I'm
saying those are right and those were
manic panic so this is the cause that
you're seeing right here on the hair I
even cut even when I could I still have
the hair colors and if you like move the
hair around you'll see it all like
different sections of the hair with
different colors and it's kind of cool
because the hair is kind of morphing
down to green color which i think is
kind of cool I'd have not why
here since I've had it I don't get
shedding I don't get tangled I don't get
any of that kind of crazy mass the hair
is really really good it's staying and
it's good it has good behavior it's like
behaving well guys um I really don't do
that much to it but just curly like I
said I didn't watch it but if you know
Manic Panic is semi permanent so
therefore once I watched some of the
color come out so what I plan to do is
go back in and dye the hair I know as my
forgot plan to yeah I plan to dye the
hair again and just give it a little bit
more life so when I come back it won't
look so dull like it does right now it
look more vibrant and pretty for you
guys it is the closure is a free part
closure but I did do it in the middle
part the closure is pretty much good I
do put concealer on it so I will you can
actually shift it over i do shift it
over sometimes i do have clips in right
now but i'll show you guys what it looks
like if i shifted over so i do put the i
have this this unit is actually on a
dome cap with elastic band and
everything like that i believe i showed
it to you guys in my last video so I'm
just going to take the clips on i'm just
going to transfer the hair to the side
so i can show you guys what kind of
styling you could do you can do it as a
side part you can do it as a middle part
or whatever you can flip it on both
sides so i can flip it towards the Sun
right here and I cut it in the racial
enough so that when I do flip it to this
this side which is my favorite side to
flip it over to I still get the
variations of the bank piece right here
and I also get the segments of the waves
and it's all still seemingly the same
length so when I was cutting and I made
sure that I moved it around a little bit
before I cut it so I can get like the
same length in the same look and I
absolutely love this this color guys I
love the style of the cut the texture of
the hair is really really good like i
said i don't get really a lot of
shedding it's a very minimal shedding
tangling is not a problem for this hair
doesn't tangle out at all I do put a
little bit of argan oil and for moisture
just because I do leave my wigs on the
mannequin heads and when I don't wear
them so therefore I do need to
moisturize them every time I put them on
so I do moisturizes hair and it just if
you guys can tell it looks absolutely
great and I feel like it really does
complement my skin complexion it's like
something I kind of like this hairstyle
McCullar people think that you can't
wear anything with it I wear whatever I
with it a
like I don't go where like red dress
with blue hair but you know you can
actually pair off a lot of items with it
hair and make it look really nice so far
getting so many compliments and I just
wanted to update you guys on the hair
because I do get a lot of questions from
you guys so I hope that this video was
somewhat informative like I said all the
links will be left down below and as
always guys make sure you thumbs up this
video for more videos and also make sure
