apply my foundation and I just saw this
part down because some people want me to
kind of explain things sometimes I'll
explain some stuff during this video so
this is the maybelline superstay better
skin now I use the color coconut and I
believe it's 95 coconut now if I'm not
using this foundation guys I'm using the
Maybelline fit me matte poreless flex
foundation and I use that one we open it
as well in the color 350 now it
definitely comes off a little bit orange
over lupa ish and stuff like that I
still have a tan line if you look out my
left shoulder you'll still see like the
tan line on my Thailand trip so it's
kind of hard for me to match foundation
at this point so it will give me like an
orange tint but I will add contour and
stuff like that to really dig my face
together so you just have to kind of
wait and see what happens
alright guys so the most popular context
that I wear all the time are Romanus
Koblenz calm so these lenses that I have
in my eyes with the serum brown I use a
power negative 150 bilateral
all right guys so what I was basically
using is the next tinted brow mascara an
expresso so basically just tracing my
brows kind of getting them a little bit
dark and kind of making myself a shape
now I'm gonna go in guys with my top
brow from kiss now this is an amazing
pomade guys that I got for like $5 and
it does great so basically just adding
more depth and more color and defining
the shape with this
highlighted now I am going with an
expensive setting powder called Sasha
buttercup it's pretty expensive I got up
it was up like $22 you don't have to use
this guys find something cheaper this
one definitely helps prevent creases and
stuff and it definitely gives you a nice
bright look alright guys so as far as
the lashes that I'm wearing guys these
are from is the iconic collection so
these are synthetic lashes lashes but
they have a perfect pixelation that I
love now the style that I'm wearing is
number 4 I also wear the number 6 and
you guys asked me all the time what they
are so here they are now also link them
down below
one of the websites to pick them up but
you can definitely check out your local
beauty supply store so what I'm doing is
going in with my Maybelline fit me 3/16
mocha pressed powder and I'm kind of
using the powder together to wipe away
the setting pattern just because I don't
want it to be too bright and I wanted to
kind of blend nicely instead of having
that kind of like
after looking really like pale and
really like once I kind of go see look
so I'm going in with the next stain
matte but not flat powder foundation I
got this one in the color deep dark and
it works pretty good to kind of bring in
some color I'm also going to use the
absolute New York bronzing powder as
well to to kind of bring in some
highlight and kind of like shimmer on my
cheeks this definitely brings more
definition to my face I'm just not
looking off types of flat
so basically what I did first was wine
my lips with a brown lip pencil no it's
a dark brown lip pencil there's no
specific one you can buy anyone it all
works the same so don't get crazy trying
to find the right one they're all the
same to me I also used a Lolita which is
my favorite favorite hold it stick from
Kat Von D now this is the only lipstick
that I use for this mom look you cannot
get me off of this this is the only one
that I use so there's no other one guys
this is it it's Lolita from Kat Von D
alright guys so this basically wraps up
the video I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I will leave all the items that I
use down below in the description bar

four most important things like comment
