Oh
the sambal
so this is the unit that I showed you
guys from the dueling hair company that
I made some of you guys hated this unit
and someone who do you guys like this
unit so basically what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to use the prism lights and
some 40 volume developer I used two
packs of this one and this is the blue
pack and this one is supposed to give
you like kind of like good coloring or
whatever and these are kitchen gloves
that actually convert it into coloring
and bleaching gloves so that's why they
are yellow but red these actually work
really good when you're doing colors the
little cheap gloves they don't last and
you can reuse these ones so this is what
the mix looks like guys it's really blue
it's a little bit chunky so I might go
in and add a little bit more developer
to it to kind of get it to thin out so
basically I'm gonna do with this unit is
just color the ends I am going to color
the bang as well because I'm gonna give
it more of like a fun really big curly
fun colorful look it does have the front
of the closure at the top to look like
you guys know so I'm going to transform
this color and make it something cooler
and something fun for the fight so I'm
back today with another update slash
hair review video so I would see my hair
is big fun and crazy now in colored so
if you watch my two or three wig
Wednesday wait three maybe three with
Wednesday's ago or four I showed you
guys some hair from the Dooley hair
company and it was this really large
black wig that had like curls and it was
blonde and black in the front black all
over so basically I kind of bleached
hair so I basically wanted to try
something different because when I first
did the video you guys weren't too happy
with the hair and I think it's because
some of you guys were relating
yourselves to wearing this hairstyle
saying that it might not look good on
you for me I was kind of like I liked
the hair a lot but I didn't Co watch it
in the beginning so the way you guys saw
it was just straight out the pack so
once I called its hair obviously have to
co wash it and stuff like that so this
is the natural true state of the hair
when it's curls now guys this is bundle
hair this is not a wig I created this
wig myself so when you're buying this
hair you're just going to get in your
bundles
and then you'll make your own your own
wig so I'm just gonna say that now so
you guys aren't confused looking for a
wig link cuz there is none so basically
I created this wig myself and I will
link the other video up here somewhere
or down in the description bar so you
guys exactly where to look so basically
I just went in and did a lot of I
basically just dye the ends mostly so
even starting from the bank part right
here I color the ends like a little bit
blonde I did it from this part right
here and then some at the ends now this
was 24 inches of originally in the
closure was 20 inches so basically what
I did was I kind of cut it so it kind of
like worked all together because when
you kind of do a closure that's about 4
inches less than the bundles usually go
like this large entire gapping space
which I absolutely hate with the weaves
and wigs like I just don't like that
especially it comes to making your own
waiting using bundles if there's like a
huge gap with a mixed length I just I
have like an issue with that especially
when it's curly hair so make sure that
if you do get curly hair in the bundle
the closure is a little bit shorter than
the bundles you can actually kind of
frame your face by trimming it some
areas so that it kind of all goes
together in unison I am not professional
guys sorry I kind of did the best I
could do to this unit and I actually
think it actually looks really nice now
I will show you guys a side by side
where you guys will see the black one
versus this one so it's like a
completely different unit guys and I do
think that the color kind of amplify
this look even more and as well as me
washing it so those curls now look more
delicate and they look softer and more
natural and pretty so the only thing I
did was Co wash it with conditioner I
used a swabs conditioner and I did go in
my can to leave in conditioner just to
kind of solidify the curls not with all
my curly hair wavy hair curls anything
that has kind of like a wave pattern
that is initiated with water I always
use my Cantu leaving conditioner and I
will link that down below for you guys
I'll use that on my way view here on my
curly hair just because once you've co
wash the hair and you put this leaving
conditioner on it basically takes the
hair to another level it solidifies the
curl pattern and kind of gives you a
nice moisturized look you really don't
have to add any oil
stood here all you have to do is wet it
at the leaving conditioner and this is
what you're gonna get so now that I see
the pattern when Cisco wash I really do
like it
even more I did like it black but I kind
of felt like I said the color really
brings my skin color out and it kind of
amplifies the fall effect so it's more
so of an autumn fall style wig you can
dump it keep this one for the summer
time if you do want to do that
now the doula hair company has very
inexpensive bundles and closures
frontals etc etc I'll leave all the
information down below for you guys if
you guys are interested in checking them
out come on sis look at this like this
is probably like recently one of my best
work other than that full blonde wig
that I do that a few weeks ago so but
this one is actually really like I'm
really really filling this a lot guys
and leave down in the comments if you
like it better this color or you like it
black but I'm sure you guys are gonna
say this one looks better it's just I
don't know maybe it's the whole makeup
look and I know you guys are gonna
inquire about my eyes I will do a video
about this contacts so I find this guy's
second pair cuz I actually lost one of
the eye so now that I have a complete
set for both eyes I have two colors to
show you guys then you guys will
actually see them and these contacts are
actually 25 they're like they're
everyone's mine with the solidity lunges
which are like a hundred dollars this is
a quarter of that price so if you guys
want some prescription contact lenses
that look this good this real then I
will have that video just make sure you
go down below and write a little comment
about it because you know the more you
push for it the faster it comes so guys
that's basically it for this video I
hope you guys enjoy this video do not
forget to thumbs up this video leave
your comments down below subscribe and
share this video with your friends and
family and I will catch you guys in a
later one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
