hey guys welcome back to another good
Wednesday thanks for stopping by today
again now in today's video I'll be
showing you guys away from El wigs calm
now today's wig is a curly unit now I
did a curly you know my last of
Wednesday but that was a styling video
where I styled it up in a bun so for
this video today I'll be showing you
guys how just wear the curly wig how I
would wear it down and put a little bit
of products in it to define the curls
and make it look for solace now this wig
is a 360 lace front wig it is 20 inches
long 180 percent density and yes I'm
reading it off my phone and this one
does have a pre plucked hairline as well
as bleach knots and it is a medium sized
cap now it links all these are firming
all this information down below for you
guys because you guys asked me often
what size is this etc etc etc but it
will be listed down below now let me
show you up at the wig looks like I
haven't done a curly wig that it hasn't
been styled up in a while all my other
curly wigs have been styles and like an
up style so I wanted to do this wig just
to keep it simple and show you guys how
I would saw my curly wig now this one is
a good density 180% it's pretty good the
curl pattern on this unit is really
pretty guys the curls are really really
light and soft now it does come with
your standard cap it's about four inches
of parting space at the top and about
two inches in the back when I did 360
units I really kind of feel like it's
kind of pointless sometimes but for
curly ones it might not be that
pointless because for this one you're
able to put in the high bun high
ponytail which I usually do for record
units anyways but for the purposes of
this video it'll be down now it does
come with two combs on the side right
here as well as well as one of the base
here which I never use this one is way
too far down for me to use anyways and
there's also comb in the back when
adjustable strap now I'm not going to
add an elastic band on this one I'm
going to just tighten up the straps and
then see if it fits or not it's a pretty
nice size capsule shift in my head I do
have a smaller head size so if you have
a larger head this is definitely going
to fit you precisely now I'm going to
cut the lace off I'm not that I think
I'm going to go just a few baby hairs
down I'll probably do a side part and
try to find a way to make it look dumb
so if you guys are interested in
with this you know like today guys I
would like you to stay to you to keep on
now
you
you
not
alright guys so this is what the unit
looks like so basically for this unit I
just decided to trim the ends a little
bit now that here is about a 20-inch but
for some reason it came out a little bit
of lacking at the end so I decided to go
into this trim the end and I decided to
do it kind of like a one-sided look just
because it I have this like little tan
going on now and I just thought it would
look so cute like an island hairstyle so
like if you want on vacation whatever
etcetera etc I think that this wig is
really pretty for that it's like a nice
curl pattern and the way they did the
front like that they pre tweeze the
front part the hairline and then they
kind of bleached it as well it just
makes it look so nice and realistic you
cannot tell me that this does not look
like my real hair it definitely does so
I just think it looks really nice like
this you can wear it like the regular
way wearing a like this but I kind of
feel like with the density of this wig
it the density is 180 percent but it's
not it's not a really good percentage
density for the curl pattern if the
curls are a little bit tighter and had
like women you wet it high like they
still have like it's bounce to it I
would feel differently about it but it
doesn't have that the belts that I
thought it was going to have once I wet
it but I feel like once you ear let it
air dry not tousle and turn in it and
play around I feel like it will give you
that potentially amazing curl but you
know me I was testing the waters at this
one else trying to play around but I do
think that this looks really realistic
it looks really nice and the hair is
very soft guys not dry at all or kind of
like a mask this is like really nice I
don't get any tangling and any shedding
or any of that kind of stuff so that's
the a-plus-plus for this one
and with a hairline like this you can't
you can't go wrong like this looks
really good guys so yeah so that's what
I decided to do with this one I'll hope
