another year of you day so this unit
that I'm sporting today guys from EE
fling calm so they sent me there ombre
styled
Bob unit now obviously you guys see in
this video I didn't do much this unit
just because it was perfect came nice
and the style that I had in mind was
gonna be very simple anyways for this
entire video so I didn't get all crazy
so this unit guys is an ombre style unit
it came like this I didn't cut it
I didn't color it tone it nothing at all
so this is a color that came now they do
have a wide variety of wigs on the
website so I'll make sure I'll link all
the information down below if you're
interested in this or any other unit and
as well as the coupon code you guys know
so this unit guys is just basically a
lace front unit so you only get parting
space in the front you don't get any 360
business so there's nothing in the back
it's just tracks it's a simple lace way
guys very easy now if you're somebody
that just likes a simple wig like this
and wants to just change a purse a
little bit and do something ready for
like spring and summer think this is
very nice now in the beginning I was
kind of off put about the color just
because the color look real brassy to me
but I think now that I look at it in the
light it's not too bad I don't know if
my like orange cardigan is kind of
clashing with it but I feel like it
doesn't look too bad now now as far as
me doing baby hairs with this one I
usually like to do like baby here fun
and maybe hair magic which I call it but
this time around I didn't want to do too
much because I was kind of going for
like like a little flip kind of method
like not flip over method but like a
little bit of a cascading method with
the bang now I just did a light curl
this unit guys I did not go in and try
to do anything like dramatic it is kind
of like that great lob look so therefore
just giving it like a little bit of
curvature on the and just made it look a
little bit better and kind of give you
more of a realistic vibe speaking of why
I didn't do baby hairs so the hairline
guys is actually pretty pretty good you
can see it oh wow it looks really nice
you guys always tell me to come up close
to show you guys the hairline so this is
what the hairline looks in it's a little
bit of crust right here on this one but
do not worry about that when you just
clean it off so this is what the
hairline looks like guys it's pretty
sufficient
it looks pretty pretty good guys
and like I said I didn't want to do too
much of that baby hair magic just to
kind of throw off the hairline a little
bit because I wanted it to make it I
wanted to make this unit look like it's
coming off of my head so I think I kind
of achieved that with this one but I do
like you guys it is a silky texture so
you're not going to get like the yaki
grip to it and you guys know I'm like a
yaki person but this one is actually
pretty nice it has a really soft balance
to it so if you're trying to do
something really nice for the summer
something that's not heavy something
that's really little night light and
airy this is definitely something I
would consider getting just because look
at how beautiful that cut is and just
adding like a really nice light curl to
it just kind of makes it a little bit
more fun a little bit more pretty and
nice I always tuck mines behind my ear
but you can definitely bring it back up
and kind of define that front curl this
part didn't curl too well but if you
define that front curl part you're
probably half of better it'll probably
look a little bit better but yeah there
goes okay all right all right all right
but you know me
gotta had it tucked alright guys so I'll
leave all the information down below if
you're interested in purchasing anything
