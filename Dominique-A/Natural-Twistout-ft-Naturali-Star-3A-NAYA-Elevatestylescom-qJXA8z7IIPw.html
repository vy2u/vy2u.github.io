would like to start off by saying thank
you guys for all the wonderful comments
you guys left me in my first every Q&amp;amp;A
video I did promise you guys that I will
do another Q&amp;amp;A video soon it'll be in
like the next two months because I
noticed that I start posting a Q&amp;amp;A video
I felt like so many followers on
Instagram and snapchat so I want to say
thank you I enjoyed through the Q&amp;amp;A
video you guys enjoyed it too just to
get to know me a little bit better I'm a
cool-ass bitch if you get to know me if
you guys have some more questions I will
tell you guys in advance that I'm doing
Q&amp;amp;A video again and it will be soon so
yeah and also let's let you guys know
that I will be doing some vlogs now
especially cuz the summer is coming up
and I have a lot of events that I'm
going to so I wanted to share some vlas
with you guys you guys can follow me in
my daily life to see what it's like to
be me I don't live in a really exciting
life but when I go out and do things
it's particularly fun so I want you guys
to follow with me and my blog too so
yeah so this year it's going to be kind
of different and it's going to be a lot
involved so but I'm going to continue to
my with Wednesdays as I promised you
guys so I post videos now every
Wednesday Fridays and occasionally on a
Sunday so you guys will see me three
times
god-willing so yeah so in today's video
I'm going to show you guys the wig from
elevate style calm and this wig is from
the Syst sister waste collection and it
is they're basically they're kind of
natural twist out wig unit and I've only
seen a few weight reviews on this unit
and I thought it was so nice so I just
whipped it up this time and add a little
bit of color and
good I didn't want to do the one bees
because one bee is born so I wanted to
add a little bit of color so this is
going to be a 1b 30 and 33 mix so it's
going to look really good I didn't open
it yeah or and try and undercut anything
yet it is from the naturally star weight
collection is the pre tweeze part and
this is what the box looks like guys and
like I said it's in sister ways and this
is basically this very Hollywood
collection they have so many names but
this is what the unit looks like guys
I'm really excited about this this looks
good and the way that the box is
designed where you see the hair coming
out in the afro as an afro is exactly
what it's supposed to look like and I
like how we do the boxes is probably one
of the best packaging that I've seen
thus far so I'm really excited about
this so if you're interested in seeing
what this unit looks like today on with
Wednesday I want you to stay tuned
so this is what the unit looks like guys
what I ended up having to do was kind of
cut some hair from this area right here
it was a little bit too much hair right
here and I just wanted to kind of make
it a little tapered down so it doesn't
look too overdone but so far I really
think that this hairstyle is an
a-plus-plus what I kind of did was I
just got rid of the part by hovering
over some here at the top right here to
close it in a little bit I felt like the
part looked a little bit unnatural
especially the way it was parted on the
side right here it just didn't look
realistic so I just dumped that idea and
just went to do like a cascading curls
kind of look one thing I really like
about this hair is the color if it
wasn't this color I probably wouldn't
like it too much it's because it'd be
kind of boring but the color makes it
look so nice and sunkissed this is the
perfect unit for the summer in
springtime this looks great guys and if
you're like someone who's in natural
ISTA who loves to do like really natural
kinky hair style twists out looks like
this this is the perfect wood for that
like I have never ever had my hair like
this or had a wig like this and this
just looks so good like this is like a
five-minute do and it actually looks
like you actually twisted your hair the
night before and untwisted it and this
is like diva right here and I'm not used
to wearing units like this I'm simply
used to wearing kind of straight silky
non-realistic
hairstyles but this one really looks
realistic and I think looks good with
hoop earrings or maybe like some diamond
earrings I just thought the hoop look
good with it
and I just I don't know it isn't totally
different for me I hope that you guys
think it was cute because I actually
really like this and I'm actually going
to wear this to summer I'm going to hold
this wait till the summer I think was
like nice like a dresses summer dresses
spring dresses nice just dashikis on and
stuff like this this little girl this
looks so nice and just like a soft beat
makeup this is it like this is this
right here this it right now like I'm
just really feeling myself in this
hairstyle like
it is a little bit on the large implies
you're not familiar with large hair I'm
not really familiar with large hearing
like this but natural is what's in right
now so I think that this will this is
this is it this is it so I'm definitely
going to wrap this up a summer I love
this so make sure you check down the
link down below for this hair unit and
also make sure you thumbs up this video
if you liked it leave all your comments
down below I want to hear if you guys
have to think about this what you guys
think about this hair because this is my
first time trying something like that
and it could either be a hit or miss but
I think it actually made a cut and then
also subscribe if you haven't and I will
catch you guys later on another wig
