talk to you guys about the whole color
pops trend and these are the color pops
ultra matte lipsticks and these are
liquid lipsticks guys and they dry it
off Matt if you watch the beginning in
this video you seen that I tried all
nine shades that I purchased and i
absolutely love all of them right now I
have the color guess on my lips right
now and this is one of my favorites I
have actually five favorites the others
I like but I'm not too crazy about as
you guys can see some of them look
really good on my skin tone and some of
them don't look that great on my skin
tone but there's always ways to mix
match and pair them off so on my front
my five favorites is zipper which is a
purple color I also looked old because
tells like a very neutral mavi color
like that as well limbo which is the
brown color it's a really nice brown
color and looks so nice guys switch over
the wintertime i also like blacks LAX
LAX is a very very dark brown burgundy
color it is so popping on your
lips I really really like this against
my skin tone in my lips and last but not
least is guest which is all minutes now
um I guess it's a bit more like a winter
color like a vampy color it's supposed
to be a purple but it's like a dark
purple blue color I'm I know you guys to
tell us before but i really like it guys
it looks really good and it's like a fun
color for the winter time these are my
top five right here i did not get any of
those like bubblegum pink colors because
i'm not really into that bubblegum pink
look I just I just don't feel like it
looks nice against my skin complexion
but to each his own if you like that you
do you these are colors that I feel that
are very very nice against my skin tone
and if in comparison if you could
compare yourself to my skin tone and you
like the way it looks against me you can
try it out these are only six hours guys
and they do sell fast on the website so
if you get alerts like I do they usually
tell you when something new comes out or
when they restock their items I lucky
enough got the email and was able to
purchase my products with no problems um
the other four colors that I'm just okay
with our more of the lighter colors I
just feel like they're a little bit too
light against my skin well I like Avenue
was actually really nice coat just a red
color so I'll add that to the other list
that's the number six avenues like a red
color it's really
ice read pretty it is just just a
perfect red color for your lips off
added to my favorite that's number six
so out of the three out of the nine
three of these colors kind of did it for
me but kind of didn't do it for me like
I said they're all very consistent one
thing I need to tell you is that when
you're applying it on your lips make
sure that you apply and not smack your
lips until it completely has dried
because you'll kind of get some fraying
when you do that so you should
completely let the whole thing dry and
then start smacking your lips if that's
what you choose to do but I notice when
you start smacking your lips before you
do kind of smudge some of it off so I
don't think it has anything to do with
the color payoff or the product payoff
it's just that you just gotta let it
mattifies first like it's supposed to
and then you can go ahead and play off
with it but like I was saying before
these three colors I mean I guess these
are a little too light for my skin
complexion I will say that the only car
that I really have a problem kind of
like like getting and like having a good
relationship with is trap trap is a way
to it's not way too light it's just it's
probably a car that i would put in the
middle of this just to make it look like
an ombre the trap is not a color i would
suggest a woman like me as the my skin
complexion to just try to pull off and
walk out the house like this without a
lighter or anything because this is
going to look absolutely powdered donut
and if you're unfit if you're like in
love with that powdered donut look then
this may be for you but it's not for me
you just really have to work this out
because it does come off looking a
little ashy mouth little powdered donut
e mouth and I'm not for that like so
this will not be worn by itself it
definitely will have to be on braid
until lipstick like the one I have one
now these two colors i may say i really
like this is for the new collection this
is the what is this this is koala and it
is beeper i think its co-op is kind of
like that gray tone I actually kind of
like this but like I said I really have
to work on this one to make it look like
like make it look really good so I
actually like this one I don't know if
you guys like it leave your comments
down below its how much you guys like
this if you guys like this lip swatch on
me it's pretty cool guys I'm not going
to lie so you really have to kind of
like peer this off well tone down the
makeup a little bit don't do too many
crazy eye shadows or anything like that
but I feel like this one will actually
really really work so I'm
I consider wearing this like just to
where I maybe look for a going out kind
of thing and I also do kind of like
beeper beeper it's kind of like a subtle
pink like a subtle nude it's not too
crazy when you pair this off the lip
liner does well it's just more shocking
just because of the tone like it's
really a she looking so I'm especially
because it's matt so you just got to be
careful with that so it's good that's
just it like I'm not going to blab off
and keep ranting and talking about this
I really like these products guys
there's six dollars apiece and you
cannot beat that they do they're really
mattified and they don't come off like I
can kiss my hand right now i'll show you
guys they do not come off on your hand
so it's just kind of like a really good
product for a really good price I do
apply like two to three coats on mines I
know some people just do one coat I like
my lips to look like I want them to be
like really really nice and call the way
covered I'm sorry to do three two to
three coats if you want to do one coat I
guess that's okay but I do to the three
coats oh that's just what i do i think i
just spent two by the way so excuse me
if you guys caught that that was gross
but like I was saying guys I do two to
three coats if you want to do one coat
that's your business but I two to three
quotes actually lands the job it makes
it look really good so um yeah so that's
about it guys I hope you guys like this
