guys about the whole color pops trend
and these are the color pops ultra matte
lipsticks and these are liquid lipsticks
guys and they dry it off matte if you
want to begin in this video you seen
that I tried all nine shades that I
purchased and I absolutely love all of
them right now I have the color guess on
my lips right now and this is one of my
favorites I have actually five favorites
the others I like but I'm not too crazy
about as you guys can see some of them
look really good on my skin tone and
some of them don't look that great on my
skin tone but there's always ways to mix
match and pair them off so on my friend
my five favorites is zipper which is a
purple color I also looked old because
tells like a very neutral mauve color
like that as well
limbo which is the brown color it's a
really nice brown color and looks so
nice guys especially for the winter time
I also like blacks lax
lax is a very very dark brown burgundy
color it is so popping on your
lips I really really like this against
my skin tone in my lips and last but not
least is guest which is on my list now
um I guess it's a bit more like a winter
color like a vampy color it's supposed
to be a purple but it's like a dark
purple blue color um I guess the Tubbs
before but I really like it guys it
looks really good and it's like a fun
color for the winter time these are my
top 5 right here I did not get any of
those like bubblegum pink colors because
I'm not really into that bubblegum pink
look I just I just don't I feel like it
looks nice too gets light skin
complexion but to each his own if you
like that you do you these are colors
that I feel that are very very nice
against my skin tone and if in
comparison if you could compare yourself
to my skin tone and you like the way it
looks against me you can try it out
these are only six dollars guys and they
do sell fast on the website so if you
get alerts like I do they usually tell
you when something new comes out or when
they restock their items i lucky enough
got the email and was able to purchase
my products with no problems the other
four colors that I'm just okay with are
more of the lighter colors I just feel
like they're a little bit too light
against my skin well I like Avenue is
actually really nice coat just a red
coat so I'll add that to the other list
number six avenues like a red color it's
really nice red pretty and it's just
just a perfect red color for your lips
ah add that to my favorite that's number
six so out of the three out of the nine
three of these colors kind of did it for
me but kind of didn't do it for me
like I said they're all very consistent
one thing I need to tell you is that
when you're applying it on your lips
make sure that you apply and not smack
your lips until it completely has dried
because you'll kind of get some fraying
when you do that so you should
completely let the whole thing dry and
then start smacking your lips if that's
what you choose to do but I notice when
you start smacking your lips before you
do kind of smudge some of it off so I
don't think it has anything to do with
the color payoff or the product payoff
it's just that you just gotta let it
mattifies first like it's supposed to
and then you can go ahead and play off
with it but like I was saying before
these three colors I mean I guess these
are a little too light for my skin
complexion I will say that the only car
that I really have a problem kind of
like like getting and like having a good
relationship with is trap-trap is a way
too it's not way too light it's just
it's probably a car that I would put in
the middle of this just to make it look
like an ombre a trap is not a color I
would suggest a woman like me as the my
skin complexion to just try to pull off
and walk out the house like this without
a liner or anything because this is
going to look absolutely powdered donut
and if your info if you're like in love
with that powdered donut look then this
may be for you but it's not for me you
just really have to work this out
because it does come off looking a
little ashy mouth a little powdered
donut mouth and I'm not for that like so
this will not be worn by itself it
definitely will have to be on braids
until lipstick like you want to have one
now these two colors I may say I really
like this is for the new collection this
is the what is this this is kawaii and
it says beeper
I think it's co-op it's kind of like
that gray tone I actually kind of like
this but like I said I really have to
work on this one to make it look like
like make it look really good so I
actually like this one I don't know if
you guys like it leave your comments
down below it's how much you guys like
this if you guys like this lip swatch on
me it's pretty cool guys I'm not gonna
lie so you really have to kind of like
pair this off well tone down the makeup
a little bit don't do too many crazy eye
shadows gonna do like that but I feel
like this one one actually really really
so I might consider wearing this like
just to where I may be like for a going
out kind of thing um and I also do kind
of like beeper beeper it's kind of like
a subtle pink like a subtle nude it's
not too crazy when you pair this up in
the lipliner it does well it's just more
shocking just because of the tone like
it's really ashy looking so I'm
especially because it's matte so you
just got to be careful with that so
that's good that's just it like I'm not
gonna blab off and keep ranting and
talking about this I really like these
products guys there's six dollars apiece
and you cannot beat that they do they're
really mattified and they don't come off
like I can kiss my head right now and
show you guys they do not come off on
your hand so it's just kind of like a
really good product for a really good
price I do apply like two to three coats
on mines I know some people just do one
coat I like my lips to look like I want
them to be like really really nice and
called away covered I'm sorry to do
three two to three coats if you want to
do one coat I guess that's okay but I do
two to three coats so that's just what I
do I think I just spit to by the way so
excuse me if you guys caught that that
was gross but like I was saying guys I
do two to three coats if you want to do
one coat that's your business but two to
three coats actually lands the job it
makes it look really good so um yeah so
that's about it guys I hope you guys
like this swatch video I'm trying to do
these kind of videos these are really
popular lipsticks so I thought this
would be a great video to do this on
