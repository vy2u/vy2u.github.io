with another wig review now today's live
review is brought to you guys from a
company called Bella waves calm and I
have reviewed wigs away from this
company previously saw I'm back today
with another one now this one's that I'm
showing you guys is the lace front wig
and it's the Brazilian version here
silky straight 20 inch wig and it's in
the natural color now the difference
with this way compared to the last wig
is obviously the length and style but
they have also kept they also started a
new construction on their way caps and
they've added elastic band to the wigs
now this is what the cap construction
looks like it's the original cap
construction you get three combs in the
front one at the base and two other
sides as well as one comb in the back
with adjustable straps and then they
added this strap in here as well which
is supposed to be kind of like your
adjustable strap it's more so like a bra
strap instead but it does have an
adjustable strap gauge right here so you
can make it loose or make it tight so
this is very helpful it's that it's
easier instead of going on having to buy
it buy an elastic band and slowing it on
so they provided now with their wig
units which kind of makes it easier for
people who want to adjust the links to
their head size so I'm going to probably
just cut the lace up with this one try
it on add some curls in it and then come
back and show you guys what this unit
looks like the hair is really nice guys
I have not received any shedding from it
it's very pretty no smell and it's just
your basic straight blunt cut 20 inch
silky straight hair so if you're
interested to see what this dude it
looks like I want you to stay tuned and
keep on watching
hi guys I'm back and this is what the
wig looks like I ended up deciding just
to make this one of my bun or ponytail
wigs the hair is actually not as thick
as I usually like it it's about 130
percent density and because it hair is
so silky straight you don't get enough
wool for quality to the hair it just
kind of really flat and I kind of
thought it made me look a little bit
more chunkier in the face with the hair
being so so soft and thin like that so I
just decided to make this kind of like
one of my messy bun wigs I did glue it
down with the dr. B glue method and just
got the baby hairs popping up on the
sides and stuff like that and then I
just put into like a nice messy bun I
hope you guys think that this is cute
it's just a regular styling look it's
nothing important nothing special that
you guys haven't seen already but I do
like the unit this way I do want to say
that the new construction of the wig
caps is a plus because you don't have to
go in and sew in your own elastic band
it already comes pre-made with an
elastic band
which makes it better and it fits snug
at night so that's an A plus plus other
than that I think just the quality of
the hair the texture the hair for me is
probably not the best the one that I
would like I do like my yaki textures
and my curly texture silky straight is a
bit iffy sometimes is it because of the
density I just spend like a 250 density
like the way I reviewed wild oh it would
progress into like a little bit more
better but like I said what wigs like
this when you purchase them you always
can use them for multiple purposes this
purpose the purpose for this was would
be ponytails and like high messy buns
which I think looks fabulous let me just
show you guys with the back looks like
so that's what the back looks like guys
it's you'd have to play around with it
to make it look good but I think I did
an okay job with it I just think that
this is a fun hair stop you just want to
look like a relaxed look put a little
bit face on and just kind of really like
jeans and sneakers and whatever and just
keep it cute in cash so I believe you
like this here so I think a compliment
to look so yeah so make sure you guys
leave all your comments down below also
thumbs up this video and also subscribe
if you have it I'll be back next week
Wednesday for nut with another hair of
review so stay tuned for that and I will
catch you guys later bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
