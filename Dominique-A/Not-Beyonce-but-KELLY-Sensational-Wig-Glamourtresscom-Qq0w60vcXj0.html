are you filling my with custom filling
your way so far so goo only family I'm
starting off with a series called wig
Wednesday's so every Wednesday I will
post a video on a new unit that I'm
reviewing for you guys so I'm really
excited to start these new projects in
2017 so I hope you guys are rocking with
a bitch so this video is going to be on
sensational wigs one of their lace front
wigs and this is a 4 by 4 silk based
lace wig and the wig that I'm reviewing
today is called Kelly and it's in the
color 1b this unit was sent to me from a
company called glamour tress calm and
I've done reviews I've done reviews for
them before so you guys will see more
coming from that company and some more
as well so this is Kelly and I think I
feel like two or three reviews on
YouTube for this unit
some people review the code units I kept
it simple and stuff with the 1b my you
guys will see more collar unit for wig
Wednesday's because I'm going to try to
do things outside of the box that are
flattering to me so this is what the wig
looks like guys and I didn't even open
the packet I just got in the mail so
this is what the wig looks like it's one
of like those really big diva curls um I
haven't done a curly wig just like this
I did one on the it'll come up or put it
somewhere in this video and I'll link it
down below or another way that I did a
curly unit that was kind of similar to
this but not that big so I'm excited
about this one because it's going to be
more of like a diva style wig unit and
I'm gonna try to see how I can
manipulate it maybe I'll do a side part
or a middle part and you guys know how
to do my loose powder thing and yeah
so if you're interested to see how this
looks I want you to stay tuned and keep
on watching
Wow
are you feeling my wig custom feeling
your way to pass something on it family
mama says okay hmm
Oh them or fear me o shoreland baby you
know it's all good ah you're pretty fine
girl I have a pretty piling stunner
you're pretty cool girl I got a really
good kisser ah ha she's feeling my way
you be stuck to what friend says she's
feeling my face ha
she's stealing my place she want to do
with me when she feeling high ribbit
 up you go back again II was awfully
bare who quietly judging she looking
very hard to my yellow Lamborghini get
you well then maybe having a girl Donna
like mine she uh she they would follow
my mind she'll be picking this over a
white man when she drop in the room for
a black man they be carried it all
horrified my see the wish in the world
for a lot man
she be picking a soul out of my mind I
just drop in the door I'm a bad man
jingim swiss again it looks like it's
actually like really really big I wasn't
expecting there to be this big I'm not
really used to wearing her to too big
like this but hey it's always nice to
try something different if you really
like big hair like this this might be
the unit for you
one thing I can say about this hair is
that the curls are really defined and I
would also do exactly what I did and try
to cut some layers off in the front so
that you can frame your face a little
bit just cutting some layers right where
the part is that will make it look a
little bit better so that you have kind
of like dimension going into your face
the hair is about 24 inches long it's
really really long guys it's like really
really really long if you want to you
can go in and cut the ends of a two so
it does doesn't look like so long and
kind of actually chop it like up to here
which I probably would do just because I
think that way actually looks better so
I'm just going to chop some of this here
at the bottom just to kind of make it
look a little bit better guys I
should've did that before that's a good
idea I just thought about that as I'm
looking in the mirror I know that I
should probably chop the end and start
to like who's coming in and out I feel
like I look extra bright right now Wow
okay whatever so um see I actually like
it better like this in this link right
here this link looks a little bit better
and look more I don't know it looks
really cool and Afrocentric and pretty
so yeah so I didn't get any shiny from
this one I then when they get tangling
but therefore it's curly hair it's got a
tangle I'm not planning on running my
hands to it to cause it to tangle so I
won't really be expecting any of that or
anticipating any of that happening for
myself so I like it I would probably try
to a different color probably like a
light brown color and number four number
two I don't think I would do blonde in
this just because those blondes and
curly hair kind of look funny but to
each his own if you like blonde hair I
would say go ahead and try it in the
blonde with the dark roots that one
looks cute and I see someone review that
and it was actually pretty nice but I
like it and even the cut itself made it
look better I just think it looks really
cute just to hit on top of the breast
and yeah so that's my review for Cali
guys I hope you guys thought this video
is interesting and informative

comments down below thumbs up this video
