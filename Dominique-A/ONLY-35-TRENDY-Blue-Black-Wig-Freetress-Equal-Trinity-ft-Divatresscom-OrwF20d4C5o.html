what
hey guys how's it going so I'm back
today with another hair of you so I'm
really excited about this hair review
today just because I have not done a
synthetic and expensive unit in a long
time and when I pop this baby out the
pack and tried it on I was super duper
impressed so this unit definitely guys
is giving me a lot a lot of life like
this is kind of like a yaki textured
unit it is kind of like a blowout style
so let me just get into the specs of it
so you guys know exactly what unit this
is so this is a free tres equals silk
base lace front wig this is a color OTB
lbk which is blue black and it is a
style Trinity now I have an obsession
with free trust free trust actually has
like the best unit like I'm gonna say
that because most of the units that I
review that we're synthetic were from
free trust this one right here people is
poppin now I did have to go in and
customize this unit just because it
wasn't like to the top top tee but like
it honestly came through really nice
even without the additives the hair
style the wig itself is a nice wig it's
almost kind of like a straight bolo out
and it's like a really nice yaki texture
now I did try a different color this
time because I always do black so I
wanted to do some color I am I'm pretty
impressed I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty
pretty freakin impressed this is the
autumn black blue color and you guys
cannot tell me this wig ain't pulling
through right now like I am and I went
the route in the beginning when I sought
out the pack I was like nah bro this
thing can even be cute like I'm gonna
have to finesse this wig a lot to make
it cute guys like just just look at that
look at look at that like come on like
can I please get like please if you guys
don't share this video I don't know come
on like guys so basically what I did is
that basically cut baby hairs into this
wig so when you first get this wig
you're not gonna get all that baby hair
magic so don't get confused people I
didn't come like this so you definitely
have to go in and cut the baby hairs
yourself I did going on this side and
tweeze it a little bit just because it
was a little bit dense in that area so I
wanted to kind of tweezer
kind of bring the bring the style in but
guys you can't even tell me nothing
right now so I did going to add a little
bit of powder on it just to kind of
emphasize the parting space it is a four
by four silk base so you can pour it in
the middle you can put it on the side or
flip the sides so it definitely is a
plus plus on that I really like this
guys and I think that for the price that
it is it's less than fifty dollars and
if you need a hairstyle for New Year's
Christmas or whatever you try to look
for whatever Christmas party you got to
go to whatever you celebrate definitely
check out diva tress calm guys they have
the units on deck now this one you can't
get in the regular one be one or
whatever it is but they do have a lot of
these kind of mixed colors like these
kind of like they have a burgundy one
like this too but the black blue one I
really was trying to try something
different but I think I really I got
this one so I'm definitely gonna bring
some more of these here views to you
guys and I am gonna show you guys a lot
of affordable here reviews like very
within the neck within this month itself
so you guys are gonna be really excited
to see what I have to show you guys some
things are kind of like out there but I
wanted to try something different on my
channel so that can give you guys more
views more options and not everybody
wants to spend two to three hundred
dollars on a wig so I got it I got to
kind of give you guys a little bit extra
help so these are gonna be options for
you guys who don't want to spend that
much money and then still want to be
fabulous AF so guys I will leave it
information down below for this unit and
do not forget guys to thumbs up this
video leave your comments down below
