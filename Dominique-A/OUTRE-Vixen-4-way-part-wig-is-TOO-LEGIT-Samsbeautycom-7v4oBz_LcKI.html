another wig review
so today's we review I recorded this
video early in the day realized that my
camera wasn't on the setting that is
supposed to be on which earth to me now
that I kind of like Gould and figured
out how to I was even almost about to go
to Best Buy I'm a stomach my lenses
broken I thought all the stuff is going
on so I was freaking out like oh gosh I
just want a new phone yet today because
my phone broke on Jamaica so nothing has
to buy a new camera but I got warranty
so I ended up just sitting down taking a
deep breath and I figured it out so my
lens doesn't scratch I had just a little
bit dust in the inner cap and then I
realized that the setting on my camera
was so screwed up I don't know if I was
playing around with it when I was away
like I don't know what I did but I fixed
the setting now so now I'm back in the
way I'm supposed to be so I kind of like
already like cut the lace off the unit
but that's not going to matter because
the purpose of this video is to show you
guys what the unit looks like and how I
style it so the unit is going to show us
today is a vixen unit from ultra and I
got two colored er 27 now this is the
vixen parting wig which kind of gives
like the four part parts in it so you
get like four sections now that you
start like a so and I was similar to
this but nobody really does someone's
anymore everyone does the wigs wigs yeah
I really think that maybe was just
always a mark like everybody's about a
quick weave or a wig so now this one I
decided to get the dr 27 which is kind
of like an ombre blonde and black
because a lot of people are reviewing
the black one and I'm like always doing
black hair so I wanted to try something
different
so I hope you guys like this now if you
stay so you want to keep on watching I
will show you all the sweaters here all
the specs is how I put it down and how I
show you guys how the parting is and how
I like to wear this unit on myself so
the interested in seeing what I have to
offer in today's video guide I would
like you to chase you if you don't
alright guys so this is the vixen wig
from ultra now I told you guys before
this is a Collard er 27 so it's
basically like an ombre black and then a
27 at the bottom now in the beginning I
was so nervous by trying this wig just
because of the color but I'm trying to
jump on different spectrums on the color
scale so that can give you guys
different hair options different hair
looks like I totally was terrified of
this in the beginning but I think that
this is so too expressive in the summer
time I might you'll be a pigtail wear
but because of the purpose of the video
I wanted to come to show you guys one
style that you can do with this one now
I'm going to say this if you're going to
buy this unit and you're going to wear
these styles in the Vixen style parting
way I highly recommend you do this on
the mannequin head versus doing on your
head now I completely just got the
middle part down that's the most
annoying thing about this unit it's not
easy for you if you have you know your
hair to find the parting space which
just doesn't make sense to me I always
before to make wigs like this that they
perfected the ideas instead of just
putting out there thinking like okay
this is going to be a top seller because
it can part four ways yeah it is a top
seller it is a quality wig and it is
inexpensive and it definitely looks
pretty much realistic now I did do baby
hairs myself because the weight came on
baby haired and I'm just not about to do
that with a synthetic unit especially so
I didn't go in and try to play as a baby
here's one thing I noticed was actively
blue guys that I want to mention in this
video is that sometimes it got to be
blue can definitely be really crusty so
what I did with the gossipy goo
this time is mixed with argan oil and
then like put it on my head and with the
headscarf and I find that it's less
crusty if you put like a little bit of
oil on it or mix it together the gossipy
glue so definitely try that out because
that's actually working for me now
like this thing is so crusty sometimes
that it's like really embarrassing and
annoying or you can just Pat it out with
water and there go away but it kind of
lifts the lace a little so you got to
kind of figure out which works but argan
oil mixed with the gossipy glue is
working for me now
so I'm very happy about that but the wig
is pretty good it's kind of like a big
head of friendly sized cap I have a
small head and it fits me good but it is
still a little bit loose so I definitely
have to glue this down a little bit in
the front and kind of like adjust the
straps to make it fit tighter other than
that guys absolutely love this here just
make sure that you always have not
always have a paddle brush when you try
to detangle this hair definitely use a
paddle brush because this hair is very
very it's supposed to be a natural
blowout so therefore it's kind of thick
and coarse in a Yacky type of texture so
you want to make sure you brush it up
before you do your Styles because you
get a lot of kinking not in the nape
area so much more so towards that ends
in a kind of kink up so try to go in and
brush your hair when you're trying to
sell instead of trying to run your hands
through which I did mistake now is it a
hit or miss I think that this is a hit
like like I said it's better styled on a
mannequin head versus installed on your
head so you can style it the way you
want on the mannequin head and then go
in and put it down with the doctor girl
which I should have done but I would try
to do this video so I was like no but
I've been final result wise the hair
cells that I chose her hairstyle that I
like and I think that they actually came
out pretty cute I think that this is
cute too I am one afropunk into afropunk
afropunk and binges in Prospect Park in
Brooklyn at the end of this month so
this could be a potential hairstyle and
if you see me there you better say hi
guys do not try to be scary yeah so this
could be a potentially good hair sell
for like a festival or something like
that said it's very cute and fun and
yeah so that basically wraps up this
video guys I hope you guys enjoyed this
