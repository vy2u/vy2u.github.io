to my channel it's been a while guys but
I'm doing a video today on my hair and
my quick weave that I have installed
right now
um it's been long awaited since I've
done a hair tutorial I've basically been
trying to like you know let my hair take
a breather from braids and I've been
doing a lot of quick weaves lately um
but I do plan to do a video on some good
hair some virgin hair which I freaking
love and I'm trying to do something more
curly for the summertime and more bread
for the summertime so do stay tuned for
that for all you virgin hair lovers out
there because like you guys I love
virgin hair too so I will be doing a
video of some really good hair um that
I'll be purchasing soon I just don't
know what kind of hair I want yet and I
do love NuStar hair company but I want
to try a different company so I can give
you guys all a bigger scope of what is
out there instead of just sticking with
one company and plus I'm not sponsored
from that company so I can go wherever I
want so guys um the hair that I have in
stock today is from the beauty supply
store it was purchased for about 30 4.99
and this is the hair and it's a 100%
human hair Milky Way hair and it's some
style European weave 14 inches in the
color t 527 and I got this hair um the
other day and I just really quickly
slapped it in today it is 14 inches but
I cut the hair I like long hair but I
wanted to do a really cute asymmetrical
bob or so so I wanted to keep a lot of
length in the front so that's why I got
in a longer length so that I could have
more of more length over here because I
love long hair and I didn't want to lose
out on it when I did a Bop I still
wanted to maintain the bob look that's
you get I'm saying
maintain a long look so I kept the I
purchased in a 14 inches in it I think
this is probably the only inch that they
had left um it's really nice it says
this tangle-free hundred percent human
hair Milky Way hair so we'll see about
that
I give you like a little brochure in and
when you get the when you get the
extensions so you got like a little
brochure and they talk to you about it
blah blah blah and that you know how you
get your regular milk
here out of the pack so it's really
nothing surprising for you guys I go to
a beauty supply store to buy hair and I
did buy for $34.99 I mean it's really I
went somewhere else it was more
expensive but I know the guy that works
there the owner so he usually cuts me a
really good deal because I usually help
his customers out when they go in there
buy hair and I give him suggestions so
he always gives me a good deal I also
bought two stocking caps you know it's a
quick weave so I bought two black
stocking caps and I used both of them
and you have your regular old glue your
daddy's bonding glue to use I'll show
you guys what that one looks like and if
you guys know what it is I have my
regular natty super weaving binding glue
and this is what I used to do my quick
weaves I mean I mean everyone uses that
to do their quickly so this is what I
used to do my quick leaves and just to
regular old stocking caps that I just
slapped on top of my head and that's it
and this quick weave is an invisible
part the part is not too prominent which
I like because I don't like when it's
like a big part so this is what it looks
like it's pretty skinny and the closure
is right handed you can see that closure
it's indefinite you can't even see
anything I'm showing you guys where it's
at but honestly if you got up on my head
to actually see it you would not really
be able to see like like it like that
bad and the part is really skinny which
I like so it's not like someone's going
to be looking at your head like girl
what the hell is that on your head I'm
playing but it's pretty um
straightforward I just glue the tracks
I'll show you guys what it looks like I
just basically glue the tracks just
straight across just any type of place I
just play to the tribe's you see this
gap with the cap is that right now
I just glue the tracks down right here
in certain spots I'll show you guys
right here see I glue the tracks right
here still on the cap once you cut the
cab it kind of cap it kind of splits so
it's split it on me so I just glued it
down right here and that's basically how
I do it there everyone else has their
specific method of doing it but this is
the way I do my weaves my quick weaves
so I just put the cap down like that um
I was kind of skeptical when I bought
the color I want to do an ombre bob but
this color was sharp as hell and I am
NOT light skinned I am a Coco looking
sister so
it was kind of like scared from in the
beginning but when I went and tried I'm
like oh my god it looks nice I didn't
show you guys with the backhand side but
I'll show you have to like a slow turn
don't jump down so I hope you guys can
see it I try to cut it to my best
ability so I hope that it's like decent
enough for you guys or for your liking I
do my quick weaves when I get my sew ins
I do I can show here I do sew ins a lot
for other people but when it comes to me
doing it I rather let my girlfriend do
it because she can do it I she's really
good at stuff like that too but I just
don't want to do the weaves like
braiding and song in by myself cuz my
arm gets so tired so I just let her do
my um sew ins and stuff like that let's
watch quick weaves I master that skill
by myself so um that is something I
could do when I decided to cut the back
I use the rubber band meth I'm the
ponytail method where you just put a
ponytail on the back of it and then you
just cut it down um it still was looking
kind of crazy so I had to go back and
keep chopping it I had to do two chops
in two days so I install this hair
yesterday and I have to keep chopping it
- this morning I woke up and I had to
keep chopping because me I had this
issue where if it's not right it's not
right so I wasn't looking right to me so
I just had to go back and chop it up
some more so I got it to the look that I
want to look at I wanted to look at I
mean the blonde is very bright but I
feel like it doesn't really clash my
skin and actually brings that you know
it makes it look more better and this is
way this is a way to a lighter blonde
from my new star hair company when I
bleached it when I owned braids the new
star hair it was more of a honey golden
blonde and this is just like a straight
up blonde not platinum blonde like Nicki
Minaj but blonde like blonde blonde
blonde and like I said I'm a woman of
darker skin complexion so therefore this
was like a hit or miss for me and I'm
going towards the hit side because it's
working and I'm working this hair um
even I posted pictures on Instagram if
you check me out at delicious Dom 12 you
can go check that out check the pictures
and see what I'm talking about
it's like info like you guys can see
what it looks like now in real life you
don't see what it looks like because
this is a straight up camera view and
the pictures will show you what it looks
like so this is just what it looks like
I mean it doesn't get any better
I love this it's so nice like it's so
much different cuz it's like it's kind
of more of like a POW in the face if you
seen it's like wow oh my god her hair is
like blonde it's kind of different I
kind of felt awkward I thought I made a
mistake in the beginning cuz when I was
putting the hair and I was like yo
licious so freaking light I'm gonna look
like a idiot but oh I guess not
but I'm so happy that it worked out for
me um and for you guys I want to know
what my natural hair looks like if you
go on my Instagram I posted a picture
like hours late earlier before I
installed the hair and I showed you guys
where natural hair was looking like and
it's actually growing right now and if
you guys noticed I never leave my real
hair out and I don't leave my real hair
because I've had bad experiences with
weave in the past like you know leave
outs and my hair breaking off so I'm
just trying to let my hair grow back to
a very acceptable length so that I can
you know actually do a nice leave out
and a full weave or so in doing so when
my sleeve on and not be so conscious
that it doesn't look great you know what
I'm saying so I'm in the process right
now I leave my hair nacho letting it
grow breading it up one every once in a
while and doing quickly is just to
protect my hair and I know a lot of
people been protecting their hairs a lot
with quick weaves and weaves and stuff
like that and I've got a lot of you know
I watch a lot of videos other people's
videos on YouTube so I know and I've
gotten some skills from other people of
how to protect your hair and I've been
trying to do that because I want my hair
to be at the best possible length and
the best quality ever because my hair
before was really thick it was really
thin and ugly and weak like it was just
a mess but I had starting to
work out the way I wanted to so I'm so
happy so check those pictures on
Instagram at delicious Dom 12 and thank
