what video it's a part Indian what tell
me 25th nine hey guys how's it going so
I'm back today with another wig review
so in today's video I'll be showing you
guys the unit from my first weeks comm
and I've previously worked with my first
weeks comm so I will link that video
down below for you guys and if you're
not familiar with them just google
search them in the engine now today they
sent me a 10 inch full lace wig now this
is a pixie style cut unit now they
didn't do any styling to it they just
kind of gave it to you with the hair
it's already cut in on the wig so you
basically have to take this unit and
kind of create your own look and create
your own style for it now this does come
with three combs only it only comes with
two columns on the side right here one
comb in the back with adjustable strap
there is no base comb here which I
absolutely am thankful for because when
you get full lace wigs and there's a
comb right here it really is irritating
of spots because it won't really give
you a good middle part any type of good
parting with that clip right there so
I'm happy they did not put it there but
this unit guys is very nice it's in
natural color and you can see it has a
lot of body but it just doesn't have a
style so what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to glue this unit down
with the doctor to glue method and then
go in and try to curl it the way I would
like it to be curled and I'm probably
going to do something that's off the
face versus being on the face and that
kind of like that Bowl look style
so hopefully that works out with this
unit I am NOT going to bleed should not
to do anything particularly with the wig
cap itself it's perfectly fine the way
it is and I'm not going to be doing that
much parting because it here is short so
I'm going to try to give myself kind of
like a cute natural look with this wig
so our hope it works out so if you're
interested in seeing what this unit
looks like I would like you to stay
tuned to keep on mark I don't know
Padma yeah yeah equality video what you
video is about Martinez what tell me
Mike spit on that thing we are looking
click on up when you watch stop if you
watch like click on stereo kangaroo hey
Donna
there are no no my to do anything and I
might be but wonder why them and I'm so
numb I give you an animal
b-but Mundy random so tell me what you
want them to yellow goodness controls a
mother feel of no wine and flow you
gonna be pirates your amigo tell me what
you want to do I believe you all that
more admirable of you wine and flow is
gonna be private or friends they sell
you think athlete your eyes research
genes on the rubber duck down behind
follow me follow me follow me follow me
follow me follow me follow me of all
those shortages and so we see no whining
come on what not really one CPR let the
fun run you will see moon with your
modern toys
well when you guys don't hear the air
conditioning in the batches because it's
really hot today and I just wanted to
put this air on and make
these videos so this is what the unit
looks like after my first week calm you
definitely go to the hair salon and get
them to cut it for you really good me I
just kind of cut as much as I could on
this side to kind of like make it a
little bit more flatter on this side as
far as this time with the bang is that I
just decided to leave at the length it
was I think it's a really nice way of
cascading the hair down I don't know I
just think that this is really cute if
you're someone that does not like long
hair on your back in the summertime or
period this unit is definitely one that
will work for you I would honestly wear
this unit like I just think it looks so
realistic and obviously I did go and
play at the baby here and the way what I
do for my wigs to make them look real by
adding powder to the front like my
regular face or foundation powder to the
front of the lace so that it doesn't
look like it's not my skin so I think I
kind of worked that one off good but got
to be Goo method it definitely is a
little bit messy with these units but
after a few days and put a little bit of
argan oil on top of the nasty white cats
it'll just look fine
so that's just something you have to
work with a few days after installing
the hair whatever but
think that this is cute let me turn
around to show you guys at the back
looks like I did my best in the back so
like I said guys it's not the best cut
or tapered look that I could have did to
fix it but I think I justify Lee did a
good job like look at how nice too
subsided and it's really pretty the
hairline is perfect and the hair density
quality and texture is absolutely
gorgeous
if you're looking for a quick sassy sexy
hairstyle that's not going to cost you a
lot of money that's not going to be a
burden on you in the heat then I
definitely recommend checking out my
first looks calm for this baby right
here so do not forget guys to thumbs up
