in with my tweezers and just pulling
more hair out now this is definitely to
be a second project for me so I'm
probably gonna have to go back after the
video and just tweeze some more just
because the hair is way too thick do not
order extra baby ears unless you're
prepared to actually customize this so
this is the finished look of this unit
so this unit was sent to me from Ray's
e-signature hears from Instagram now I
did review another unit for this company
a few like last two months ago now this
unit is an ombre style kind of like a 1b
30 colored braided cap unit so it is a
lace front on the beginning and just cap
in the back so what she does in the
front she actually braids the hair in
the front and then she goes in in the
back and so is individual box braids now
her cap construction is excellent guys I
love the way her cap construction is
it's kind of one of those Metin of those
non-dimensional caps spandex dome caps
that she uses so suck really stretchy
and she also adds an elastic band for
the customer as well now for this unit
guys I did order this with extra baby
hairs which I regret doing just because
I have a lot of work to do with the
front now I did show you guys parts of
what I did I tried to tweeze as much
hair out of this as I can but
unfortunately I'm gonna have to go back
and customize this some more just
because the baby hairs to me are just a
lot now I'm trying to keep this video
hundred percent with you guys like if
you're gonna order a unit from her just
make sure you order it the way she has
it don't try to be extra like me trying
to customize and you know just just
doing the most
but overall do you like this hairstyle
guys though so I think that you call it
the Kenzie brains I'm not sure to call
better link it down below it's a very
popular style brain so they kind of do
like little individual braids going back
now this unit was actually flat in the
beginning but what I ended up doing was
actually putting this into a ponytail I
have an egg size head like an oval egg
head so it just kind of looks funny when
the hair is like super super flat and
braid formation so I definitely had
switches up so I decided to do a high
ponytail right about here and then I
just wrapped a few braids around the
hair tie and just covered it up to make
it look kind of clean I do actually like
it this way I even flipped it over to
the side like a side ponytail and I just
I don't know why I just thought that
this was so so cute so I probably kind
of rocketing styles like this I have a
couple of festivals to go to and stuff
like that so probably where there's a
couple festivals this summer now like I
said the only thing I did not like about
this guy's or not that I didn't like
something that I kind of feel like I
need to work on is tweezing the hairline
and kind of customizing this I should
never order with most like two months
wavy hair just because it just became
too much of an issue while I was trying
to do the video but um yeah I did try to
do as much as I can glue the baby hairs
down I add a powder in some of the parts
of the actual cap inch area and then I
did some right before the braid stops
and the baby hairs come in so therefore
you got kind of like a semi realistic
vibe so I did what I could but other
than that I do think that this is very
nice guys if you're looking for a nice
summertime hairstyle that you don't have
to sit in the chair for like four or
five ninety-two for five hours for like
seven to ten hours I feel like this is a
quick getaway you know quick thing to do
if you're going on like a cruise or like
a kind of like a beach vacation this is
definitely some type of hairstyle that I
would say to bring with you it's very
lightweight guys which is surprising
it's not heavy so I don't feel like a
lot of strain with this one and like I
said I'm probably gonna rock it in a
style like this just because I my head
shape is just way too damn overly and
long to be rocking it down flat the way
it was when it came so I think that this
hairstyles probably gonna work for me I
think it's cute and it's faux rash now
guys I will leave all the information
down below if you're interested in
purchasing this unit from this company
