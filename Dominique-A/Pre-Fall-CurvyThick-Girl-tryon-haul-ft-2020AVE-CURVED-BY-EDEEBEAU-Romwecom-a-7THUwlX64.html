back with the fashion Friday video so if
you guys know I was sick with laryngitis
for about two weeks I was just trying to
recover my voice was really really bad
guys so I practically lost my voice I
didn't go to work for like three days -
so it's not like I cut YouTube
completely out of my life I actually
couldn't even go to work cuz it's not I
mean I can't go in front of like
patients and stuff like that signing
like a dead horse so I stayed home for a
few days I did pre record the hair
videos so therefore that's why you guys
saw a whole bunch of hair videos come in
like three hair videos a week because I
mean they're pre-recorded so I might as
well posed to lop anything away but
here's the fun video and I love doing
these videos and you guys gotta keep in
mind these videos take a long time to
edit so that's why I didn't want to come
on here and do like a voiceover or have
my sister do a voiceover for me and then
post video up and and not be the way I
want it I actually like sitting and
talking about the clothes so this is
what I love to do so guys I have a whole
bunch of items today so this video is
gonna be a bit lengthy but it's a good
video
I believe all the items down below for
you guys I did get sent two dresses from
Edie who is also a youtuber and she does
like hair she's from the UK she does
hair fashion she's pretty poppin I will
link her channel down below she did send
me two of her dresses from her curvy
collection line and she has bodycon
dresses that are poppin guys so you guys
will see that in this video and I will
link it down below for you guys you guys
are interested in purchasing her items
now everything else will be linked down
below as usual it is a lot of stuff guys
so if you're not interested in sitting
down and listening to me for 20 minutes
you probably should exit out of this one
or kind of skipping pieces but don't do
that just be nice and watch the whole
video please so guys if you're
interested in seeing what I have to
offer in today's video I would like you
to stay tuned and keep on work alright
guys so the first place I'm gonna show
you items from is from a company called
20/20 app now I believe this is a
california-based website and they do
have a Kirby collection and they do have
some really really nice stuff now I'm in
between the size
surely I'm in between large extra-large
and 1x depending on the stretch on the
clothes so if I shop like for fashion
over for instance I can do like the tops
in the size large and some of the items
in large but then everything else will
have to be an extra-large or 1x now one
thing I notice that sometimes the 1x
pants are too big for me so I'm more so
of an extra-large or I can try a 15
sometimes a 15 is dolphin fit me
depending on the depending on the
stretch now this place does have 1x and
they're plus size they don't care extra
large so I'm just letting you know that
in the beginning referencing the items
I'm going to show you so the first thing
I got is this cute little teddy style
bodysuit now this one actually was a
little too big on me
I would have showed it to you guys full
body without like the bottom part and
just showed you guys like the Bott like
you know without pants how to showed you
got two other pants but it doesn't fit
the way it should fit like the crotch
part is way too long but tucked in with
jeans and with a skirt is something you
would never even notice that so I was
like I'm still gonna wear this crap so
it's kind of like a teddy or kind of
like a I call it teddy because it
looks like one so it's like a sheer
bodysuit and there is no coverage on the
boot part so you do have exposure of the
nips but if you have a darker areola you
really not gonna see it that much unless
you're like studying it like real hard
so I thought this was so cute so it does
come like a thong style in the back so
it is pretty thought it's pretty long a
thumbs down in the back however this is
just too big for me on the bottom and a
little bit on the top it almost looks
like the cup size is a little too big
but once I kind of fixed it up it
actually fit my boobs well and this is
the size 1x it is perfect stretch and it
does have an adjustable strap right here
I feel like this would be so cute with
kind of like sweatpants and sneakers and
just I don't know I just had that
sweatpants and sneakers vibe in my head
I think this would look really cute with
sweatpants sneakers and a leather jacket
or jean jacket I don't know I just
thought it was really cute and this was
inexpensive the website doesn't have too
many expensive items especial to comes
the plus size I feel like sometimes they
overpriced our items at places but this
one is actually pretty pretty boy that
is a screen tea from them and this green
tea is just your regular screen tea I'd
kind of go a little heavy with the black
items which I didn't mean to do but this
one is black with white writing and it
just says girl power now I like this one
a lot just because they had that fake a
corset part at the bottom which was
really cute that whole corset look and
what the shirts has been really trending
so I wanted to get this one I don't
think or I do have another one that I
got a while back but this one was cute
because I had the concept of like a
screen t plus a little corset thing
which is brought it in together I
thought this was cute this is a size 1x
and you can definitely wear this with
jackets stuff you know what I mean guys
it's just a really nice screen tee and I
liked it so I picked it out I'm really
heavy with sneakers in this in the
winter so I will probably match these
with a lot of sneakers cuz I love
sneakers drunk with dresses jeans
everything it's just I'm a sneaker
person during the fall so you guys would
see a lot of that now the next thing I
got are these kind of palazzo pants but
these aren't palazzo pants because not
really palazzo pants it's listed I
believe as palazzo pants on the website
but these pants actually cut off like
right where the ankles at so I guess you
could call them the I'm not gonna
pronounce it cuz I'll it up so
insert it here colossi thing is Sonny
pronounced it I'm not sure but you guys
know what I mean so they're kind of stop
like above the ankle which is not my
style I kind of feel I'm not not for
everyone I'm just saying this for myself
I kind of feel like if you're like a
little bit curvy or a little bit more
bigger those type of pants kind of look
funny on on me at least just because I'm
like have you everywhere else been like
it stops like right where my ankles at I
don't know if you guys know what I mean
I'm saying this I know someone out
there's gonna know exactly what I mean
these are really cute though now these
are size 1x and I don't know what kind
of one XS is because these aren't just
tight as hell like they hugged every
inch of my body so I definitely would
say if you're buying these size up and
this will be the first time I'm sizing
up to 2x which is crazy
so these they don't have the stretch
that you think they're gonna have
they're actually like a solid fabric it
is really pretty ass kind of like a
floral kind of design on it and even at
the ankle part that kind of goes into a
white color with a little bit more of
that floral design look I really thought
that these were really really cute guys
despite
fact that there are 1x and there's
absolutely no stretch on these which was
really really annoying but they do have
an elastic band on the way so you do get
to you know tighten it up at the waist
part and then the waist doesn't even
stretch that far either so this was
almost a fail to me I would not
recommend wearing it with a crop top
like I did I would say maybe wear it
like a white t-shirt like a regular
crewneck white tee or something like
that and put like one of those throw
over cardigan sweaters a longline
cardigan sweaters over just because it
really didn't cover too much of my like
it was it it didn't sit on my hips and
my butt the way I should have so it's
it's kind of weird now the next thing
that I got is one of my favorite items
and this is the last one from the
company now I've never ever gotten one
of these before and now that I got this
I really want some more colors in it so
this is basically one of those kind of
like hammer style pants suits like nut
suits like yeah whole body suit jumpsuit
now it is black and it has kind of like
the batwing style legs that's what I
mean battling batwing style legs it does
gonna have like a low cut right here so
I mean I don't know if you want to wear
a bra with that I just didn't just
because I mean I didn't want all the bra
straps I'm hanging on stuff like that
now this one definitely can be a
transitional piece just because it's a
full-length suit you can definitely wear
jackets with it you could just go crazy
with this now out of the collection this
is my most favorite thing I love this
the material is so soft I even added a
belt on my waist to kind of cinch me out
a little bit to give me more of like a
clean look instead of just wearing it
kind of baggy you definitely go in and
just wear it the way it was but to give
yourself like a little bit of a form and
a shape
I added the belt on it oh my god I love
this so much guys I got this in a size
1x and it's perfect like I said you can
size it down because it is stretchy and
it's a bit large but with a belt
you are awesome I love this is one of my
favorites right guys so I was sent two
dresses from a youtuber on here who has
her own dress line and also has a wig
collection as well wig line as well so
the dresses are brought to you guys from
a company called curve by Evie now she
also has a YouTube channel and I'll link
her YouTube channel in here
somewhere here or I will link it down
below for you guys and also her website
and addresses so I got to choose two
dresses from our website and on her
website she provides like body con midi
dresses so all the dresses come right
below the knee and they're made for
curvy women and even all women can shop
on this website they do range from size
smart believe and up
she sent me two dresses in the size
medium large the first dress she sent me
was a yes dress or yes or yes I do not
to say it right that's embarrassing and
the other dress she sent me was a hurt
Bay dress so let me show you guys what
these dresses look like now I got the
select these dresses so these are on my
own taste my own style
and what I liked so the first dress I'm
gonna show you guys is my favorite and
it's the I believe this is the hurt Bay
dress no this is a yes dress yes dress I
like this a lot guy simply because of
the coloring she added pink and blue to
this one with white and black and I just
thought this was so nice so this dress
fit really nice it's not a sheer
material dress it is a nice nice cotton
material dress the dress is very very
long like I said it is a midi dress so
it does come below up below the knee cap
so with heels it will look great now I
like this a lot because it's long-sleeve
it gives you a nice coverage on the
dress so you're not gonna see any you
won't be able to see anything through
the dress which is perfect it is a nice
soft material it's not itchy and it
comes right above here so it's not
giving me too much skin exposure I'm
really weird about that with dresses
like this but this one that's actually
really good and this one fits perfect it
is a size medium/large
now the other dress she sent me was the
hurt Bay dress and I love this dress -
just because it was red and black and it
had a leopard print so both of the
dresses had a pattern animal pattern the
other dress was kind of like a multi
pattern but this was just strictly like
a leopard pattern and I love this one
because red looks so good on the skin
especially during the holidays now this
one is called hurt Bay and it's a medium
large as well now this one is a little
bit different and fitting wise this one
is a little bit loose compared to the
other one which is kind of weird so what
I recommend doing with these with this
type of situation when the dress is a
little bit
I would just shove this in the dryer in
high heat for 10 minutes and then pull
it out and put it on it should be
perfect after that this one is also MIDI
like I said it's really really nice
great material very very very soft it is
not a see-through material you're gonna
see all the nooks crannies and curves
and bumps and lumps and dumps so it
definitely is really really nice and I
love it so much guys like I said it is a
medium large I'm not sure if it's just
the stress that's like that but you can
just slap into the dry for 10 minutes
and be good so definitely check out her
channel and definitely check out her
website and I'm so happy that she
decided to send me these dresses for my
haul they're excellent and I'm always
around to collapse alright guys so the
next two things I'm gonna show you guys
well not few the next a lot of things
I'm going to show you guys from romwe
comm so I'm gonna show you guys things
in segments you guys know when it comes
to white tops I don't like pulling them
up to the screen just because it will it
will like wash me the hell on out so I'm
gonna hold them up slightly for you guys
to see but you guys will see them when I
try them on on the side screen so let's
start off with some of the crop tops
that I got now I know crop tops it may
not be the season you guys feel like
it's not the season but crop tops can
still be worn throughout the fall so I
picked out a few crop tops that I really
liked pattern wise and style wise now
you guys asked me about this one in
particular a lot on my Instagram and on
my last one of my recent videos so this
is like a green black and yellow crop
top now I really like this one a lot
guys it's kind of like one of those rap
styles where it kind of splits in the
middle it is long-sleeve and it does
have like a little button part right
here to button up but for some reason
this is really difficult to button up so
what I do with this one is I just kind
of fold it instead because for some
reason it's like these are so stiff and
it's so hard to button this up I got
this one in a size extra large I would
recommend going up a size 2 to ax just
because it is a little bit snug it fits
in the the bus region but with the arms
it gets like a little bit snug and I'm
not even sure they size up to 2x but I
would get this in the 2x it's really
cute the patterns are nice the bottom is
stretchy has a little elastic on the
bottom so that's why it's
able to fit the bus area very well now
the next thing I got is that it's
supposed to be a swimsuit but I wanted
it for most for more so of a bodysuit
it's the kind of like the low back
one-piece and it's red I picked this one
not just because I wanted to do like red
this fall do like kind of like cute
little red looks were like a red
bodysuit leather jacket Doc Martens
jeans like little fun things like that
so I wanted this one this is veining
suit style but it's really nice it's rad
it did not padding in the breast area
but I pulled the padding off because I
just didn't like it it does have a low
back I got this one in the size large
and if it's perfect
I'm definitely pissed for my vacation in
December so it'll look really nice on
the beach in December so it's kind of
like a plus all the way through swimsuit
bodysuit can be worn both ways now the
next crop top I got is we're not
actually one of my favorites too so this
one is kind of weird to hold up you guys
we'll see you when it's on me
it's basically kind of like a crisscross
crop top it does have like a chiffon
style sleeve and then it does the same
design on the arm part too like the
ruching part on the arm it's really
really pretty and basically what it does
it Criss crosses like part of each boob
has like one layer of the material which
is kind of weird but it's really cute
it's yellow and yellow looks great on
the body and not great on the skin so I
really wanted to pick this one out and I
loved it
it's more salt like a mustard color but
I call it yellow you guys know the
yellow comes the yellow family is kind
of like a mix but I thought this was
really cute and I think I got this one
in a size I believe this is the size
large if I don't oh it is is it yes I
got this one in a size large guys so it
fits good it looks good and it's really
nice so the next thing I got is it's
really cute kind of like sweater look so
this says it's a black sweater it's a
size extra large and it says friends on
it
basically like the similar logo to like
this show friends I thought it was
really cute now it's supposed to be like
a sweatshirt type of style but this one
is so thin guys so I definitely
recommend if it's in the colder colder
seasons to put maybe like a tank top
underneath or a sleeve a short sleeve
shirt or long-sleeve shirt it's really
cute
love the whole friends theme and stuff
like that so I picked this one out it's
a size extra large and it fits pretty
good now the next thing I got this is
almost like a costume style dress and I
when I got I was like what the hell is
this so when I put it supposed to be
like a shift dress when I start on the
website it's kind of like shifty and
cute so I was like I'm gonna get it be
like a nice dress just to wear in the
winter I'm still gonna wear it now but
I'm gonna actually layer this one with
like solid pieces on top so I don't look
crazy so I got this one in a size
extra-large
it's black and it's supposed to be kind
of like one of those swing dresses the
material from me is a little polyester
ish so it does come off like a little
bit of like that costume material style
dress which I was kind of thrown off on
I didn't that's not I don't really like
stuff like that so I was like mmm but
like I said I think what I would do with
this one it's kind of layered off I
think layering this one is this is one
of those things that you have to layer
to kind of throw off the costume look so
I'll probably wear like a longline
bomber jacket with it in boots and just
kind of weird out like that just because
it's a little it's a little bigger now
the next thing I got usually pick these
up on these websites all the time
because I like them so it's kind of like
the jumpsuits like really compte sweat
sweat pants sweat style one-piece
jumpsuits and I absolutely love these
just because if you really don't have
anything to wear if you're like in a
major rush all you have to do with these
is just put them on put some sneakers on
or some sandals or whatever and go and I
really like them so this one it's kind
of like a grey color it's like an off
grey color and it's off the shoulder it
does come with splits up the kneecap
which I like it gives it a little bit of
design has kind of like shredded kneecap
area and stuff like that it's also tight
at the ankle which I like about this one
and it fits perfect at the ankle and it
is off the shoulder it goes all the way
to the end of your wrist so it is long
sleeve and it's nice I do like it it's
like a really nice soft cotton material
like I said these are one of the things
that I would pick up if I were you just
because if you're in a rush and you need
to wear something I need to find
something to wear these are so easy just
to you just like step into it pull it up
and go so definitely check this out I
highly recommend picking these out
especially for
I think I got like three more crop tops
crap tiles crap top style outfits like
shirts or whatever so the first one that
I got I thought this was so cute and I
know this should have been like kind of
like a summer thing but like I said
there's ways around things like this so
do not be afraid so this is really cute
guys this is a crop top it's like a
halter top and what it says on it says
no time for boys I thought that
this was so cute so I had to I had to
get this one guys it was so so cute so I
picked this one up I think I got this
one in a size this is a size extra-large
it is a nice materials very soft if you
are a heavyset in the breast area I
would definitely be wary because you'll
probably lose a fuck-boy writing on the
bottom just because there tuck into the
brass fold so just keep that in mind
when you're buying this but it looks
really really cute I love it so much
it's just something really cute just to
put on you can even wear a plaid shirt
with this and kind of button up the
plaid shirt like right where the belly
buttons at and kind of have it open a
little bit to show this off and then put
a jacket on top of that so like I said
there's always ways around it I thought
this is cute and I had to get it guys so
the next thing I got is a white crop top
now this way crop top it's kind of like
the lettuce it's kind of like let me
call like lettuce line or something like
that I'm not sure it's really really
cute it's very very um like it's very
very small like it's supposed to be
stretchy when I got I was a little bit
like confused cuz it's a stretchy
material but when I got it when I put my
arms in it was a little bit tight huh
whatever these big old hams so I got
this one in a size large I should have
got an extra large but I think they went
out to extra large it's like a nice
little lettuce line crop top it just
barely covers over the bus so like I
said if they do have a size extra large
I would say size up just because it kind
of like doesn't go all the way it's a
quarter leaf slit sleeve length weight
quarter quarter quarter length whatever
you know what I mean so it stops like
right about here and it's simple I just
got it because it's something like I
said I'm going on I need some square I
can wear this with like a long duster
and some high-waisted
jeans boom done now this crop top is one
that I featured in another video I think
I was doing a hair tutorial and I had
this red version on and the red one that
I had on it tied two ways tight as no if
I could turn triple ways and you guys
love that top so I got the top again now
I got the top and white this time and I
absolutely love this shirt guys so I had
it red I do have it a red still so I had
to go out and get a white one it is so
so nice guys this is definitely a really
nice top to wear to a nice event with a
nice skirt like a nice a cute skirt
would look nice with his jeans like a
nice palazzo pants and little baby heels
I don't know I had so many ideas with
this one that's why I picked it out the
right one I still be rocking the red one
it's so cute and obviously I'm gonna
show it up to you guys on the side this
one doesn't have a triple tie this has a
double tie so ties at the top and then
ties at the bottom and you have like
just enough space in the middle for like
a little bit of cleavage or whatever
space you got a little bit of chest but
it's cute I got this one I believe in a
size large they have a wide variety of
colors of this one so I highly recommend
picking these out these are so nice and
think about like 10 bucks and it's super
stretchy super like free with the arms
like it's it's amazing guys I highly
recommend this is one of my favorite
items from this whole thing I highly
recommend you guys go out and get this I
feel like that keeps like switching
angles a little bit but I hope I'm fine
and you guys like the view so the next
thing I'm gonna show you guys there's
some striped items that I got and stripe
is kind of cool I love stripe some
people are afraid to wear stripe just
because they think it doesn't look good
on the plus-sized body but I do like
stripes and let not that I'm saying I'm
plus-size but I know people get offended
when I say that but for you know not the
skinny type people think that a stripe
looks funny so I like stripes and I
wanted to do some stripe for this fall
so I got this this shirt right here and
is white so I'm gonna kind of hold it up
at a medium length so this one is cute
it's a long-sleeve striped shirt the
material is not cotton guys it's more of
a polyester mix
Tyrael but it's very soft which I really
like now this one is really cute because
on the back of the elbows it has kind of
like this pattern right here and I
forgot your clothes I haven't sown one
of my Blazers and I just thought that
this was so cute guys so I picked this
one out it's just like a regular shirt
just to wear with any type of bottoms
and sneakers or flats and stuff like
that even if you're working in an office
setting or if you're working if you're
going to church and you need something
just to quickly wear I thought this
would be cute with like nice pants flat
maybe like over the knee heel boots and
stuff like that I just thought it was
perfect I love the black and white
stripes and now the accent it with that
tan a little patch in the back arm so I
really like that one now the next thing
I got is supposed to be addressed but
there's no way in hell that I'm wearing
this as a dress it's way too short it's
not gonna happen no so this is also
stripe one it's supposed to be addressed
like I said but the company agent-based
companies they like to they tend to
cater to their sizes and their sizes are
not my size so now I got this one in
size extra large and this one is striped
dress it does have kind of like a v-neck
top I'm I'm gonna end up having to wear
this into a shirt but I do like it so
it's gonna be kind of like one of those
oversized long shirts to wear with
leggings sneakers boots etc etc I
thought it was cute materials almost
like the polyester mixed materials
talking on the previous one so it's not
cotton II it's not the type of material
that you're gonna be you know you're
gonna stay warm in if you're going like
on like a 60 degree day I would
definitely put a cardigan over it cuz
it's kind of like material that the
winds gonna hit you it's Oh be careful
but I do like you guys it's very very
soft is very very pretty and definitely
could layer this one up this is a major
layering piece right here honestly so
I'm excited about so the next few items
that I got one of them is actually one
of my favorites as well too so I got
this gray style t-shirt now this t-shirt
is so cute it says bye Felisha on it I
just thought it was cute nothing like
too extravagant guys I know it's just
one of those really cool t-shirts like I
said winter is mostly my sneaker time I
love wearing sneakers
winter and boots and stuff like that so
this is just something athletic II to
wear with leggings kind of like those
fancy leggings with the mesh patterns on
it stuff like that pairing it off with
the jacket and stuff like that I just
thought it was cute I love gray tones in
the fall as well too so I picked this
one out this one knows the size extra
large and it fits nice and it fits nice
and comfortable so it's not too tight
it's not too loose it's just like right
there and right perfect so I had to get
this one and bye Felisha is definitely
popular so bye Felisha
now the next thing I got I previously
got this in the summertime and I was in
love in love in love with that dress
that was the type of dress this is well
this is the type of dress I would wear
if I'm just going to the nail place and
I like something like a quick errand
dress this is a quick errand dress right
here now I got it last time and I got
into it like a burgundy color so this
time I went for this kind of like taupe
kind of says taupe I believe it's like
taupe color and mocha color now it is a
long-long style dress it does have two
slits on the side it does have almost
like a really thin kind of sheer
material so I would recommend putting
maybe like some kind of those like
writer shorts on the bottom and maybe
like a sports bra or like a little tank
top bra underneath it's so free and soft
guys I absolutely love these especially
if you're really in a rush and you're on
the go and you don't wander like fix and
whole entire outfit up I usually like to
wear these with like longline sweaters
Sandoz and like stuff like that and just
put it on and go out the house I usually
wear these when I run my errands so I
just love it it's really nice it's soft
I believe I got this one in a size large
I think so
it is oversized so therefore I wouldn't
recommend so I would I mean I like it
oversized but if you don't really want
it oversized I recommend sizing down but
I got this one in a size large and it is
one of my favorites too it's just really
nice flow freeing free-flowing wow'd
free-flowing and I just I just love it
so the last three clothing items that I
got are kind of like outerwear not
really outerwear one of them is oughta
wear and one is just kind of like a
cardigan
two of them were cardigans so I'm gonna
show you the cardigans first now when I
saw these cardigans on the website ice
that they were going to be longer and
kind of like longer basically so when I
got the most like okay like whatever so
I got I picked an action or picking two
just because I thought it's gonna be
like that but they're still workable
these are also like I said layering
pieces now the first one I got is this
green color and then I got the same
exact one in this tan color right here
so it's just very simple it's like about
it stops like right up right like a
little bit below above the butt line
it's Korean and it's a little bit linty
which I noticed like after a while that
I was like a little bit linty it has two
pockets in the front right here very
kind of deep actually they're pretty
deep pockets in the front I want to say
put myself on them I maybe put like a
few coins in there like nickel on a dime
but it's cute it's soft it's not itchy
at all but I do notice now that it's a
little bit linty so I would be very
cautious when it wearing black pants
with this because it'll lit up your
black pants like a house so be careful
this is in a size I got both of them in
a size extra large and like I said
because I thought is gonna be oversized
extra large
isn't really extra large with these
they're not as they're not as big as I
would expect I wanted them to be a
little bit oversized but they're not but
like I said for learning purposes for
the Fall I definitely would say keep
these and just rock them out layer them
underneath leather jacket bomber jacket
and your stock and just elaborate with
these items and they're pretty neutral
base colors green and tan so you can go
really far with this nonetheless
outerwear the only other item that I got
is this fun funfun yellow leather jacket
now it's yellow or mustard whatever you
guys want to call it guys
I absolutely love this and I'm gonna try
to hold this up so it doesn't like kill
my shine cuz this is gonna take all my
shine right now but it is a leather
jacket and I believe I got this in a
size I think it's a size large or
extra-large now it is a little bit snug
in the arm area which I'm going to have
to figure out what to do
because this is not the type of top you
would wear with a thick sweater it won't
wear it won't work this jacket will work
with a thick sweater just because the
arms are tad bit tight now wearing short
sleeve and a long sleeve shirt you're
okay but if I tried to wear a sweater
with this you know I had to be like this
trying to lift my arm up so that's not
gonna happen
but guys it's well-constructed makes it
a really good job at this one it's very
nice it has all the details and all the
style in it I just think that this is so
cute I remember I bought my leather
jacket from H&amp;amp;M like two years ago and I
paid yeah you know it's funny I paid $20
for it
a week later I went back the jacket was
fifty dollars so you can cut some deals
around here but this one it was
inexpensive on the website and it is
very stylish it's nice to wear your
regular black jackets or whatever your
black leather but a yellow one on skin
like this definitely guys I would highly
recommend picking up yourself this
jacket it's really cute like I said I'm
not short that I mean when I shop on
this website I automatically go for the
highest size because I'm not taking my
chances I think that the large I don't
know if this is a large extra-large it's
not listed on here but I think that this
is I know this is the largest size and
unfortunately they don't have a larger
size that's really bumming because this
jacket is poppin and it definitely
definitely will be great for the fall
it's I just it's so nice guys it's
really really worth it I really think
that this is excellent alright guys so
I'm gonna just show you guys some final
accessories that I got in two pairs of
shoes so the first thing I got is this a
really really pretty style boot
now this may be kind of not that
attractive for some people but I liked
it when I saw it on the website so I
picked it out so it's basically kind of
like a suede stop boot with like the
floral print on it and you know how this
whole summer season this floral print
has been very popular and also velvet
has been popular for about two years now
a year and a half now so ailich
continues its trend I thought these were
cute I got these in a size 40 which is a
US size 9 I thought it was cute they had
different colors in it but I picked the
blue up because I don't have blue my
closet so I wanted to get something that
was just different
with the color bright like this and then
all the colors on it it would be really
nice to wear this would like a basic
shift dress or a basic dress period with
like a oversized sweater or something
like that I just I don't know I just
like these so much and it's not a large
heel so it's not like you're stomping
around with like a 5 inch heel this
little baby chunk here right here it's
not gonna cause too much of a
controversy if you're walking down the
street which I like I just thought it
was very simple very stylish so I picked
this one out and I absolutely love this
one guys love it so I got this pair of
Van inspired shoes now they're just slip
on style shoes so it's basically like
the checkered style on the front with
the black and then check it in the back
I thought that these are really cute
guys I got these in a UK 40 US size 9
they're really nice and comfortable
slip-on shoes I even like bend them and
played around with them to see if there
were like sturdy enough but they're
really really sturdy the manufacture on
these really did a good job obviously
doesn't have the van logo could I be
stealing but it does resemble it like
really well so I thought that this was
cute I wanted to get these I would have
bought the regular ones but why would I
get that when these are inexpensive AF
so I was like you know what I'm gonna
test these on see these are cool they
fit very nice they're really comfortable
and I love wearing dresses with sneakers
in the fall so I'm probably gonna do
this with a lot of shift dresses body
con dresses and stuff like that it's
just something that I like about it a
lot sneakers and dresses for the fall
and maybe stockings or kind of like just
I don't know some of the body is really
cute so I'm gonna try to play these up
this fall a lot so I really really
really like only got too many accessory
pieces because I didn't really see too
much of the items that I really liked so
the first thing I did was that got like
these another pair of these clear
glasses but these are different because
these are kind of like they look like
sunglasses but they're really not
sunglasses they do have the clear shade
the clear lens and their rose gold color
these were trending like crazy in this
summer and I just wanted to get another
pair because I think I lost the other
one so I wanted to get these I think
that these are really pretty guys it
does have like that pink kind of rose
gold frame and the reflection on the
lens itself is really pretty I don't
know if it's I don't know if there's a
cleanse color on here but I just thought
that this
was really cute so I wanted to get these
again hence I lost the first pair now
the only jewelry item that I got is this
necklace and I think this is a double
layered necklace
I never remember when I choose items
like what I get until I open it which is
bad but I'm it's all tangled up Bratz
it's like oh so I believe this is like a
double or triple I believe so let's see
if I can even manage to get it dick you
guys see this okay
so I don't know if I'm gonna be able to
untangle this one the way I need it to
alright guys so that basically wraps up
