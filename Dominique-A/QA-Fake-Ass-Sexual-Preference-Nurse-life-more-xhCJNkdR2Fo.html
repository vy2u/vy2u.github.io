to be my first ever Q&amp;amp;A video yeah
really excited about this one I asked
you guys to ask me questions on snapchat
and I got a couple of questions from you
lovely subscribers and supporters so I'm
going to answer a bunch of these
questions today for you guys so I hope
you guys really enjoyed it and do not
worry if you do not get to ask me
questions the first time around I will
be doing another Q&amp;amp;A video soon so you
guys will get your opportunity then so
make sure you thumbs up this video we've
all your comments down below and
subscribe if you have it and stay tuned
and keep on watching guys so I apologize
in advance if you guys see stuff on the
floor I was just really excited because
I was talking to some my girls that we
got so many plans this summer and that
includes so many blogs this summer
oh my god I cannot wait first of all
that I'm going to show you guys when I
go to D our next week so I'm going to
vlog that trip for Valentine's Day
Valentine's weekend or whatever so stay
tuned for that one so okay so I'm going
to jump right into the Q&amp;amp;A videos I
don't cheat too much so the first
question I was asked is what is my
nationality now before my Instagram you
saw my little flags in the description
bar and but some of you guys have
already guessed your I didn't tell you
guys I am Haitian so I wasn't born in
Haiti my parents were so I'm
consideration American but yeah rap
Haiti to the fullest hundred percent all
the way guys and yeah so so many guys
guest of Canadian which it's not really
yet I was Canadian or I was kind of some
African country or some of you even
guessed if I was a Hispanic but no I'm
Haitian American guys so yes so maybe
that gets right so I am reading this
service piece of paper so don't mind me
so the next thing I was asked is what
are my favorite drugstore lipsticks now
I know you guys are always asking me
about what my main lipstick is I always
wear the same style lipstick and this is
not this is from Ulta and it's from the
Anastasi of everything this collection
is the color Veronica and also where the
Kat Von D Lolita as well so I kind of go
back and forth of those lip colors
they're kind of like those Molly lip
colors
one of my favorite favorite favorite lip
colors to do guys I just I'm obsessed
with it
I just like to keep it simple with the
mauve look lips and Leslie's keeping
like one of my signatures so yeah so the
next question I got was that this is so
funny someone asked me if my boobs are
fake and if my butt was fake
so most of you guys know that these are
fake breasts they look I mean I don't
think it looks safe feeling pretty
natural now I flick on camera they look
kind of a little different like I don't
look at them like this but like they
look really good with just its little
brawl net on they don't have like any
boo stings or anything in it but what
this is bra let on they look good but
these are fake and someone I've seen is
my butt was saying my butt is 100% real
guys I couldn't get me there but I
remember once I was one well I was like
I was going to be like a fat chance with
two my buffers and I was like bitch your
crazy your butt is huge but not at that
transfer in the sense that I was trying
to make it bigger I was just trying to
mold it outside we live around or not
like larger because my ass is huge but
no I never got anything that's my butt
and I don't plan on doing it at all
either
it was just buried in my head one time
and just never happened because it's not
going to happen so I just have breasts
and these are fake things I got them
about two I believe I was like two or
three years ago I got these done so yeah
but I love the size I probably go bigger
maybe like a 550 CCS with that I'm not
doing that anytime soon that's not on my
journey I got I love it another all
about dollars today I'm trying to do so
I'll forget that but yeah my butt is
real bitches now the next question I got
was like I'll have my video guys changed
this question I think this question was
more targeted like meaning like with
weight loss and all that stuff hi my
view of guys change my field guys have
hasn't really changed even when I was at
my largest size I was still dating a lot
like the same way that I am now so I
feel like like I feel like I never
really had a problem when it came to
guys just because if you're really
confident in yourself and you know like
anyone I was at my biggest point I was
very very confident so guys look
women with confidence I never really had
a big deal I never had like a really
hard time dating guys to be honest with
you guys but as far as like as I get
older than my view of guys has changed
meaning I'm looking for people who are
serious about certain things like like
future goals and stuff like that so when
it comes to dating with what to get
older you start looking for people who
have the same future goals as you like
marriage children financially working
together to make something greater
that's what I as I've gotten older I've
you usually when I start dating people I
focus more on stuff like that so yeah so
I got so I got asked this other question
that another question is like what is my
sexual preference I don't know if anyone
I don't know if I look like I'm like you
know I have like a lot of sexual
preferences but I hope you guys you guys
I've been with girls and guys before I'm
currently dating a guy now which oh hey
so I'm currently dating a guy now and
you know she loves my life right now
like so I'm good with that but I know
you guys ask me how I you know with my
subscribers and dated girls have been
with girls before and as dated and been
with guys before so I've had both the
best of both worlds currently I'm
getting a guy so I'm not really you know
flopping off both sides although you
wish these data said I would have a
threesome but I'm not into that kind of
stuff either so that ain't gonna happen
but I mean like I just don't I don't
like I'm a shallow person I'm not a
picky person I just go for whatever
makes me happy
I don't go out looking for people who
was like up by pop top ballers looking
the blaze and his boys blaze and his
girls I don't have a preference if
you're just cheating me not if you treat
me good and we vibe really good we joke
a lot I'm like a real big jokester so if
we vibe really well then that's that's
what I go off of I don't care if your
girl boy transgender or macedon whatever
I like who makes me happy so that's what
I've always been into yes I had girls
before and yes a guy so you call me
whatever you want but I just consider
myself just an equally acceptable
accepted person or acceptable for that
accepted
makes me happy so now the next question
that I got was advice for young girls
now I'm still young I'm 26 so I guess
you guys are referring to like sixteen
year olds or fifteen year olds with
teenagers okay
so what advice I would say to young
girls I hope that I would somebody was
around to give me this advice I would
just say to you guys
and like just a few sentences stay true
to yourself believing yourself and
always keep it real the thing about it
is like especially when you're like
really young you get you get caught into
all these trends these a lot of these
Instagram social media like beauty gurus
are kind of like fake Instagram model
type of situation when they're showing
you that there's a certain standard
perfect beauty do not get caught up in
that because you will get wrapped in
that idea of beauty just stay true to
yourself and be who you are and who you
know you are don't try to be anybody
else to try to replicate anybody in the
social media because it may seem like
their lives are so so great or whatever
but they probably are not having like
the best best life or not having the
best best time and we always always
think that also libraries are having
such a great of a such a good life but
everybody has their own demons everybody
deals on their own bullshit so just
focus on yourself focus on getting where
you want to get in life and focus on
making yourself a better person stay
true to yourself and always follow your
heart when it comes to anything in life
so that would be my advice for young
girls honestly and truly so the next
question that I got is how is it what do
I like what is it like to be a nurse so
I've been a nurse since 2013 October
2013 I think I got a job maybe like two
months after I graduate two or three
months after I graduated was Fenelon
entry-level but the supervisor that I
had for the position that I fired for
she was such a joy had that she had
given she's starting up on a higher pay
rate and she just interested that I you
know whatever I know what I do but
wasn't that hard anyway so it's kinda
like a couple days of training and I was
fine
so but I just what I notice is that when
you're a younger nurse and most of the
jobs that I am in now I'm still
considered one of the younger ones which
is crazy the thing I didn't really nice
tarted that I notice is like you get a
lot of heat from older nurses and my
people have been in the game a long time
I don't know if it's necessary the fact
that they want to pick on you but they
do give you a hard time and let me tell
you something I did not stand for any of
that bullshit when they try to give it
to me straight off the bat I've always
been really sassy about shit but I kind
of felt like people try to step up to
you in the nursing field they try to
come for you and it only might be like
some constructive criticism tech shit if
you like some raw shit like oh bitch
this and that not even the big thing but
they just be real nasty and the thing
about is like when I have senior nurses
that are younger than me coming I never
like that to them I'm like always trying
to help them and I become their friends
because I know what it's like and I'm
not like fucking 5000 nurses so fucking
miserable
who wants a fucking be like the fucking
Bulldog of the hospital the facility are
you working in or whatever so I'm just
really nice with other people when they
first got up and I tried to be like
buddy-buddy with them because they're
probably gonna need me more than I need
them and I'm not there to try to be the
mean bitch I'm there to help people but
I just noticed that there was so much
hate from older nurses and so much
fucking drama and everything that's one
thing I don't like but what I recently
started doing is working home care and
doing staff relief and I feel like
that's more better because in sense you
want people breathing down your back
you're there to do your job and do your
job right and just go home after your
shift which I really like and I do like
working with kids as well so that
Pediatrics has been one of my things I
really like Pediatrics and I hope to
kind of like further into maternity as
well working in geriatrics you're
working internal medicine or working
with certain certainly like fast we said
med surg uh stuff like that is really
crazy because everyone's so critical and
everyone's so frickin crazy you know and
I just don't deal with shit and I don't
deal with bitchy as bosses either
because I have cussed out so many people
like I'm just not down for it like I
just it's not my thing so no so I also
got a question about tips for losing
weight I'm going to give you guys two
tips that I did on all my weight loss
ups and downs so these two tips are the
best tips that I use number one Weight
Watchers and I know some people don't
believe in Weight Watchers but I'm here
as an advocate until you guys right now
Weight Watchers work I'm not paid by
them or instead develop Weight Watchers
is probably one of the best things
that's out there for weight loss number
two is minimizing your meals
meaning eating smaller portions and
exercising maybe 30 minutes a day to an
hour a day that really worked for me I
just like didn't eat that much and I
worked out not eating that much with
proportions were what I really needed
and managing proportion sizes have
really helped me lose weight in the past
and exercising at least thirty to an
hour a day and that pretty much works so
those two options I've worked for me
continuously so no people so the next
question I got it says how long do you
take up nope can I take you on a date
now guys I'm currently in a relationship
not dating anyone outside of my
relationship so ya know the next
question I got was favorite wigs so I'm
going to go with one of my currently
favorite favorite wigs if you guys watch
my video on the best curly hair of 2017
that is one of my favorite favorite
curly wigs so far or wigs of 2017 I
really like that wig a lot of some other
synthetics with the legs as well with
Danity Carissa and I just did a review
on one the other day and it's pavia so
those are my favorite like wait so far
but at 2017 I really really love that
way from RPG here calm I will link down
the link for that video down below that
hair is poppin baby hairs on fleek and
it just it's just it's just amazing that
just fucking amazing amazing is anything
amazing so now another question is what
is my youtube channel about my youtube
channel kind of evolved a little bit
like what I mean evolved I'm starting to
add more dimension to my channel I
recently started doing coach on hauls
curvy girl town halls which I really
like doing because I like trying on
clothes
I'd like to show you guys more so a
sense of my fashion because I kind of
feel like if you do here and makeup you
have to know how to dress just a little
bit so I've added like trying hauls into
my channel and I do some makeup
tutorials I kind of like falling back on
the makeup to 20 because I don't
consider myself a makeup artist and
there's a lot of bad bitches out there
killing to make a game and I'm just ah
but I will do some because I know you
guys like these natural looks that I do
so I will try to incorporate some more
makeup videos and there's a lot of time
consuming when it comes to the editing
as well too so that's a really a bitch
but I also do hair reviews in here it's
just been one of my sayings I love hair
let hair reviews so I try to incorporate
those every week on week Wednesday so
stay tuned for with Wednesday's guys but
I do it every single Wednesday and I
love wigs so yeah but that's when my
child it's kind of like makeup beauty
and fashion
oh you add oh my god I was so great
makeup beauty and fashion oh my god oh
so embarrassing so let's see what uh
what is your favorite shops to shop at
for curvy girls so I like to shop at and

Toronto so I like to talk about
forever21 TJ Maxx
