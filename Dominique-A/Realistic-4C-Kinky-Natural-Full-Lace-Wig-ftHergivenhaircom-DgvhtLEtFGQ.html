today with another year of you so
obviously my hair looks a little bit
different today guys and it's completely
different from what I usually do so I'm
trying to take a leap of faith on my
channel this year and try to show you
guys some different types of units
because I always keep it the same
straight hair so for the people out
there who are that are naturally says
and do wear like their natural curly
hair and want to find a unit that
actually mimics their natural hair and
protect their natural hair while it's
still being stylish here's the unit for
you so this unit is a 4c textured unit
guys it is from her given here calm and
I leave all the information in specs
down below I believe this unit is about
a 14 inch long so it actually is not
that bad right now it looks like it's
about a 10 inch but once you stretch the
hair out it really hits the 14 now this
hair guys for me is my first time ever
working with hair this texture my hair
texture is actually a little bit looser
than this hair texture my natural hair
texture and honestly I wish my hair was
actually like this because this is more
full it has more character and actually
looks really nice so um I never ever
grew my hair out this long in the last
few years just because every time I got
to a certain point where it was almost
gonna be long like this but the curl
pattern was just never the same so I
always just said to myself you know let
me cut this off so I've always had my
hair really short but this way
definitely gives me an opportunity to
kind of live that life so I'm definitely
definitely feeling this now this unit
they did have other units on the website
and once I were actually a little bit
more manageable
similar to the curly ones that I usually
do so I didn't opt for those units and I
wanted to take this unit on as a
challenge I definitely got a little
frazzled in the beginning just because I
just did not understand the concept of
how to get this unit to look realistic
or how to get this unit to kind of work
for me now one thing I'm going to say
about this unit and if you guys know all
my natural leases out there know with
hair like this it definitely absorbs a
lot of moisture and it absorbs the
moisture quick so when you're kind of
managing this hair and you're putting
products into it which I don't really
think you should I think you should just
keep it to Snatcher water a little bit
of argan oil and maybe like a little bit
of leave-in conditioner and that's about
it so when you're trying to manage this
hair and adding products to it guys you
have to be very quick on your feet when
you're adding the products because this
hair will swallow the product so fast
and you'll get it it'll actually shrink
up very quick so with this hair I
definitely have to put my water in it
comb it out a little bit and let it sit
by itself instead of playing with it
when you do it that way the hair will
shrink up nice and it'll give you more
of like a little bouffant look like this
so it's I mean this side it's a little
bit scattered but you still get kind of
like that structured look that I was
actually going for and I actually think
that this looks really really nice like
this I did show you guys how I styled it
in the up bun but I kind of said to
myself am I really gonna wear it in that
style probably not I feel like this
style is a little bit more something
that I would wear not say now to wear
this week every single day but the day I
feel like wearing a wig like this I
would definitely wear it just like this
it does have like a really large look to
it but it does have a large look with
purpose and I usually say that a lot on
my videos the hair is big with a reason
so it looks really nice the curl pattern
is very very kinky guys so it's like
very very defined and if you want to
make it more defined you can add
products into it but I'm saying I'm
telling you guys if you're not someone
that knows how to use products in here
like this leave it alone use some water
and argan oil and you are all good to go
so that's basically what I use for this
hair I didn't use anything crazy I did
do some pot around the perimeter and in
the parting space it is full way so you
can part it anybody anywhere you want if
you are gonna stop this wig I would
recommend strong it while it's wet
because it's easier to manage while it's
wet when it's like this it's a little
bit more thicker and
you know kind of coarser to get through
however it is very soft hair guys and I
do not receive any shedding or tangling
whatsoever with this unit right here so
guys I will leave all the information
down below if you're interested in
purchasing this baby from this website
or any of their wonderful natural least
uh kinky curly units now guys do not
forget to thumbs up this video leave
your comments down below subscribe and
share this video with your friends and
family people and I will catch you guys
in the later ones bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
