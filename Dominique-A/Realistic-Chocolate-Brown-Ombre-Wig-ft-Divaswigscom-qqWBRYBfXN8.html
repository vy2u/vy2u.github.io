review so on today's wig review I'll be
showing you guys the unit from Devo wait
calm now this is 150 percent density
virgin human hair wig and it is a medium
cap styled wig now this unit is kind of
like an ombre style unit but it's not
your usual blonde ombre style unit it is
kind of like a chocolate brown unit so I
get you get like a little bit of
darkness at the root like and then you
get like a whole bunch of brown so this
unit is 22 inches long and I wanted to
try this out because I don't really have
a unit that that's technically discolor
or yeah you know what I mean so it's
really pretty guys it did come in like
this body wave curls or whatever but I
wasn't feeling the curls too much so I
went in and i swatched it with
conditioner and then I straightened it
out and I got it nice and bone straight
it is 22 inches long but I feel like
it's more like 24 inches it's really
really really long guys but it looks so
nice and the texture of the hair is so
nice and kind of it's like a mix between
silky and yaki in a way so I can
definitely appreciate here like that it
is a full lace wig so you can part it
anywhere it has three combs at the top
one at the base and then two on the
sides it also comes with a comb in the
back with adjustable straps that have
already six and I did go in and add an
elastic band myself just for extra
security on this unit and it did help a
lot because this is a medium sized cap
and I'm used to have a smaller head so
small I could have done a small so if
you have similar head sizes like I do
then you can definitely go for a size
small and still add in the last event if
you want now I really do like the color
guys is it doesn't see it's dark at the
roots and then comes down into this nice
brownish color I hope that this looks
great I'm pretty confident they look
great
yeah so you're interested in seeing what
this looks like today
ah
Oh
ah
so I'm hoping to air my houses a lot
that you guys came here in the
background now I'm going to say this I
absolutely think that this is so cute
now I was not to when I first saw the
color I was just kind of little bit like
I don't know if I'm going to like the
color but the color looks really nice
guys it's not too much too too too Brown
where it kind of looks like that
Ashleigh number four color so this one
is actually not that bad guys it's
really kind of like a nice chocolate
color now they did do a good job kind of
darkening the roots and making it kind
of look a little bit more on braiding a
little bit more bowing style I did go
and kind of play with the baby here as
usual with the got to do glue method and
then I went in and added some powder on
the parting space you can part it all
the way back but I think this is far
enough that will look realistic
and I noticed that I know you guys
notice that I do add powder towards the
front rim part right here just because
when I add the powder there it just
makes it look a little bit more
realistic
not saying that it doesn't look
realistic without the Potter but adding
that little bit of powder right there
really carries it an extra step I just
think that this hair is so nice let me
show you guys how long it is because it
is super long
so it's definitely like 20 to 24 inches
long I would more say so that's like a
24 inch long we unit it's just like look
at the texture of this hair guys did
good it is so cute
I just I don't know something about it
and like the way that it lays flat down
and it's 150 percent density and a lot
of companies they'll tell you that
especially when it comes to full lace
wigs you need to make sure that it is
thick
some companies they'll send you full
lace wigs where you can party all over
the place and it's like really thin I
hate that look because you can't really
do that many styles with it because
there's not going to be that much hair
if you're putting it up and just stuff
like that but this here is so like like
this is 150% density here like this is
wow I'm really impressed with you is I'm
not going to lie and I'm not just saying
that because I'm doing a review but like
this is an impressive full lace wig and
this is probably one of the first full
lace wigs I'm actually really really
impressed with some of the other ones a
little bit thin and because it's full
late some of them shed a lot this one I
have not receive shedding from at all
and I don't get any tangling I don't get
any of that kind of crazy stuff so
that's actually surprisingly a good very
very good thing because with full lace
wigs if you don't seal the web I mean
still the cap or whatever do all the
extra stuff it'll start shedding a lot
this one is not shedding at all like at
all and it doesn't tangle in the nape
area and just your hands just slide
right through it like I said it did come
in kind of like a they sent it to me and
kind of like a big curl or big wave look
I wasn't really too fond of that one
just because with curls when the hair is
really long like this I don't think it
looks that good unless you start
layering it off in sections so I'm
probably just going to wear this as a
straight unit just because I think it
looks absolutely bitching straight I'll
probably pick a DIN it's not ninety
degrees outside or 100 degrees outside
to wear this but it's definitely a
really sexy look for like a you know
little day party or whatever you want to
call it but I definitely think that this
is a winner guys don't forget guys leave
your comments down below thumbs up this
video and subscribe and share if you
haven't already
and I will catch you guys in a later one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
