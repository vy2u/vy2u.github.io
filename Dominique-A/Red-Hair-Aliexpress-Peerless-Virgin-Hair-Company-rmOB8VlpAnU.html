by today just to update you guys on the
hair from my previous video this hair is
from the hair company off for Aliexpress
called peerless virgin hair company and
I received 3 bundles of hair and a
closure
I got a 22 inch bundle a 24 inch and 26
and also a 16 inch closure at the top so
basically I did ask you guys in my last
video for some hair color suggestions
and a lot of you guys recommended that I
did pink hair or blonde hair so I did
try to pick the blonde hair in the
beginning I did bleach the hair and I
did put some acetone color on it just to
see if it was gonna pick up a nice color
it was really nice in the beginning but
I kind of felt like I always do that
blonde look so I decided that I would
switch to hair so after wearing it
blonde for maybe like a day I went to
Sally's Beauty Supply and I picked up
some colors and the cars that I picked
up are the L'Oreal techniques excellent
hi colors and I picked up two boxes of
the magenta color and I picked up one
box of the intense red h-11 I will list
these down below for you guys who are
interested in this hair color like I
said this hair color is meant for ready
for red Red's for dark hair only so
you're only using it for dark hair but
because I pre light in the hair this is
the tones that I got like I said if you
want to do this and you want to achieve
this color you may want to have you may
want to pre that in the hair before but
if you don't want to pre light in here
before you'll end up getting a color
that looks somewhat similar to this at
the top of my head right here but like I
said because I pre light in the hair
you'll see a lot of it a lot of red
dimensions in the hair there's lighter
rights at the bottom and there's lighter
rents at the top and some certain spots
but if you don't want to do that you can
just leave it here the natural color it
is and then put this on there it took me
about it's supposed to be you're
supposed to process to here for about 30
minutes but I kind of took a nap in
between so I let the hair saturate for
about two hours to three hours and when
I washed it off this is the hair color
that I got and it is absolutely gorgeous
I really really
had a skeptical about doing right here
just because sometimes it can be
perceived as being kind of ratchet or it
can be perceived as being really cool so
I'm just telling what you guys think
about it it's my first time doing a full
head color like this I did leave dark
roots at the top of the part as well so
therefore it's not just gonna be like
BAM red so I do have a little bit of
naturalness at the top with the closure
so therefore it's still I still kept
some of the darkness so I did deep
wavelet here guys this is what it looks
like deep wave and I just do deep wave
when I get here like this because it is
longer lengths and deep wave kind of
makes it look kind of mermaid is kind of
prettiest so I just wanted to do like
that the hair is really good I don't
receive any shedding from the hair it
does sound like a low luster so
therefore I do put a little bit of argan
oil in it just to keep it nice and
pretty and keep the the color looking
vibrant I have the hair color for about
4 days now and I haven't received any
fading from the hair color so the hair
color is still the same as it was when I
first watched it um as far as tangling I
have no tangling the closure and
everything matches perfectly the hair
does have a slight wave when you wash it
it is it is a Peruvian body wave hair so
it is steam pressed to be body wave but
this for some reason has its natural
wave so I actually think it's really
nice the hair didn't lose any of its
great quality after I process the hair
so it's still really pretty and nice so
I really appreciate that and that's
about it guys I will list all the
products I use down below for you guys
if you want to achieve this hair color
so far so good I really really really
really really like this hair there's not
that many hair companies on Aliexpress
that you can purchase here from that
you'll find it being this great of
equality so I got kind of lucky with
this one and because I'm doing a review
for this company I won't mind you guys
and tell you guys like lies this is
honestly like really good hair so if
you're interested I'll leave the link
down below for you guys and yeah that's
