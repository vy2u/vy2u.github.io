today I'm just coming by today to
basically show you guys what my hair
looks like right now I still have the
same install from before but all I did
this time was add a couple more I added
two more bundles of hair that I ordered
and posted up a video yesterday of me
I'm dyeing the hair if you watch that
video first and you'll get to understand
this video instead of just being
confused why by watching this so
basically what I did is I added two more
bundles of hair and I had two 26 inch
bundles chest at the bottom existence
see it's like really long and I added to
26 bundles to my hair and if you can see
right now the hair is red at the end
only at the end because if you guys
remember my previous video my hair was
blonde at the bottom I hombre the hair
blonde so what I do with now is I just
put the hair dye on top of the blonde
and I just turn red but the two bundles
of 26 inches I had to process that with
bleach and everything I showed you that
side too that I actually showed you guys
on my channel I use and I'm just showing
you the result now and I had to bleach
the hair first 26 inch bundle and then
put them on I mean and then dye the hair
again red color red um I got to here
from New START hair company and
obviously I'm rocking with that company
for now I like them the price is really
affordable I got to 26 inch bundles for
124 dollars at 56 cents and it was just
two bundles two piece came in the DHL
bag it came in a couple days does that
order it a couple days before Christmas
so you know the shipping was kind of
delayed because of the holiday season um
and but I got it I got it just in time
for me to go out just because it was my
birthday on Thursday yay December 27th
and um I wanted to go out for my
birthday weekend so I did go out last
night and I got when I went to the mall
I got so many compliments people were
like wow your hair is so nice and long
and they like loved the freaking they
like love the color
so like sorry I'm kind of sick my nose
is runny but um I really like the hair
it's um it's like really long I'll pull
the camera down so you guys can see how
long it is like it's like really really
really really long so
here's like sorry guys I'm uh my room
right now and it's like jungle back
there but this is the hair and it's like
super duper long and I love that the
color is really nice too which is a plus
I really don't really do like red colors
well I do do red colors but um I was
kind of nervous to do the red color I
wanted to try something for the season
so I just decided to dye red and like
everyone likes me compliment to me they
love the color and stuff like that still
kind of makes me a little bit happier
that I went for the choices red some
parts of a bit lighter in some parts are
darker but um it is what it is I like
the hair and I hope you guys liked it I
did get a question on my last video and
someone wanted to see the natural state
of the hair the hair that I have this is
a body wave this is Brazilian this is
Brazilian by virgin brazilian body wave
hair and the two pieces I got in the
back the two bundles I put two the 26
inch bundles I took out the 24 inch
bundle and I left a 22 inch and the 20
inch of the 16 inch closure so basically
had four bundles of hair in my head and
then just to close your piece at the top
you could saw the closure piece is doing
pretty well and I usually have my part
this way but I decided to switch it up
and I put it that way
so it's kind of different for me I
really like I usually like to cover this
side but I guess I wanted to try
something new so I move the closure this
way and the clone has been cooperating
with me a lot now I can like like do
like sweet bangs like I'm able to do
like nice bangs and stuff like that
within here I can do like stuff like
that so um the the closure is my BFF
right now I love this closure I'm gonna
have to want a new closure to them cuz
I'm beating the hell out of this one but
uh for now this is gonna do so yeah and
like I said someone asked me to see so
this is a 24 inch bundle I'm gonna show
you guys and someone asked to see the
natural state of the pair once you wash
it huh so this it was Brazilian body but
you know once you strain and all that
kind of loses is like bounce but it
sounds like a little bit of a wave to it
and this is the color red this one is
kind of more vibrant I don't know why
but this is a more blonde in this one I
mean more right in this one so this is a
24 bundle inch bundle I took out I'm
probably gonna go back and put this in
I'm gonna do a really instance I'm gonna
do like a whole new you know I was just
take it out and get the Braves refresh
and I'd do that and stuff like that so I
put the bang will probably still be on
this side I actually like it this way so
I probably just take it out and redo it
and this time I'm gonna fit this one and
I have to fit this one in because I like
my hair to be boof like adding this
weave in the back adding the two bundles
of 2016 in the back may the hair look so
much more buff like I love it
I like love it so much like like how it
looks just so really nice so I'm gonna
try to fit this into even though I know
I struggle I don't want it the week to
look lumpy or whatever so I'm gonna try
to fit this but no into but this is the
natural state of it after you wash and
all that kind of stuff and let it air
dry by itself this is the way that it
looks like and like I said it's virgin
brazilian body weight I pretty much beat
this hair to death and whatever I died i
bleached I process that color did all
that kind of stuff with the hair and
it's like it's like the hair still good
like I still like this hair I still love
it and stuff like that other than that I
really don't have any complaints if you
guys have any questions or anything else
you guys can just leave the questions
down below I'm trying to do my best to
get it like back at you guys with some
kind of responding back to you guys but
I mean it's like hard kind of but um
like I said this is what the hair looks
like and I love it I hope you guys like

color and I hope you guys like it too
