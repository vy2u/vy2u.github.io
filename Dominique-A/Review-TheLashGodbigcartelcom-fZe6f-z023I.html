I'm stopping by today to do a quick
review for a company and this company
that I'm doing review for is called alas
cots and I'm not sure if you guys have
heard of this company and obviously by
the name it's a company that provides
lashes for a very affordable price I
believe that the lashes are about a
dollar fifty on their website and the
shipping is three dollars don't quote me
on that just check them out at the last
calm no the last big cars all calm and
this is the car that came in the mail
with the package they're also on Twitter
so you can follow them on Twitter at the
last got and they're also on Instagram
so you can follow on Instagram as well
at the lash god the package came very
fast and about like maybe like three
days and this is hurricane it came in
this really cute pink bubble pack and it
had like so cute like hot pink like
dressings in this hat inside of it she
also sent like a couple of these little
baby cards inside to that basically have
like their logo and like cute little
things on it very professional very nice
which I really like so um it's a really
professional and very official site also
with the lashes I got this cute little
gift and it's basically like this little
treasure chest but I believe it's like a
treasure chest for eyelashes you'll
place your eyelashes that you just wore
the on the day and just put them in here
and put your adhesive in there if you're
on the go especially if you forgot to
put your lashes on this will be perfect
because you just put them in there and
go so I thought that this was really
cute and it came as a gift so I was
pretty excited about that
um and by the way welcome back guys to
my channel haven't done videos in a
while but um I am doing today and for
all my new subscribers hi guys and
Dominique so thumbs up this video if you
like it just to remind you and yeah so
we're gonna get into lashes she slumps
just sent me five lashes I didn't get
the option to choose she just randomly
sent them to me which is fine I still
like every one that I got so it's pretty
exciting the lashes set I got five pairs
of lashes and they're all different
styles so
two of them might become similar but
it's crazy because the two similar ones
that I got are the ones that I actually
really really like to wear often um so
we're gonna start off with this one
which is called Lola and it's really
nice how they actually come with like
names so this is Lola right here and
this is the lowest aisle this is
dramatic very thick and pretty like
black Chinese lashes I like this I would
probably wear this on like a really
really like Las Vegas night or like a
really hot party night or something like
that but not in Connecticut like
somewhere far if I go on vacation this
would be like my dramatic look I really
like these different genetic and they're
really pretty and by the way if I did it
much and these are 100% human hair
lashes so therefore they're pretty good
synthetic lashes are nice too but they
have like a Chinese Sheen to them
human hair lashes look natural but these
are a hundred percent human your lashes
oh this is Lola the next one is called
Beyonce and everyone's on the Beyonce
wave cuz I know damn sure I am but I've
been on the Beyonce wave long before
anybody jumped on it now so these are
called Beyonce and these are probably my
favorite set of lashes these are kind of
replicas of the demi wispies but a
little bit fuller than this demi
whispies and these are probably my
favorite style lashes to wear I really
really like these they have like like
they're really drama but not drama drama
and I really really like the style and
like I said again this one is called
Beyonce the next one is called triple
takers triple takers and this is what
this one looks like my eyes are kind of
small so I'm probably gonna have to cut
like the end off a little bit but these
are really nice as well and the thing I
like about these lashes you can apply
mascara on them to make them more pixie
and prettier and like kind of make them
bolder so that's what I like about these
lashes and like I said again these are
called triple takers and they're really
pretty the fourth one is called party
girl and party girl as well as more of a
natural lash this is probably the
closest natural looking lashes that I
have that I got from them and this one
is just really really space style and
it's a type of lashes that if you put
mascara on already
and your lashes are already full and
nice all you need to do is just cut
maybe that and off right here and cut
the beginning off right here and just
put them on and put a little mascara to
blend your real lashes wit and these
will be perfect these are really really
pretty I don't like these a lot too if I
just don't want it to liner and I just
wanted to do like a nude I like just
blank eye with like lipstick this is
this is a stop right here and I really
like this and then this is the last one
and this one's called bow down and I
think everyone's like in this Beyonce
craze because that's like two things
that have Beyonce other than Beyonce's
name another government her songs so I
was really excited when I saw that so
this is bow down and this one is kind of
similar to the beyonce one which is
really ironic but this is the bow down
ones and I really really like these as
well like I said before these are kind
of demi wispies style lashes but they're
like the full version demi wispies and
this one is kind of different because it
starts short and it goes all the way to
medium and then long if you ever go to
the nail salon to get your lashes then
they usually do like that when they
start off small but I don't think he
started off that small but I like this
because it has dimension and it starts
it gradually gets longer which is kind
of how well as my fake your natural
lashes are just one length I believe I'm
not sure I'm not an expert on lashes but
this has a very natural look as well so
I really like these too so that's about
it for the review I'm not gonna keep
blabbing off I will be doing here review
for the sunshine hair company so stay
tuned to that I am in-between here some
because I just have issues with um with
my hair I just like to change it up a
lot so now I'm rocking like a pixie well
not pixie just like a short 27-piece cap
umm that I did nothing special I did one
before and the one I did before was like
a red color but I decided to go black
this time around just because it's
winter but I'll probably do like a red
one in the summer but not red I mean
like burgundy color which is really nice
um so I probably do that again in the
summer but stay tuned for the next video
for the sunshine hair company
and this wraps up the video for the lash
guards I'm really excited about this
company and I'm really excited to try
these lashes on the next makeup video
that I'll probably do probably like my
everyday face
I will feature one of these lashes and
it's so stay tuned for that and I will
actually show it the lashes before I put
them on so thank you for stopping by on

subscribers thumbs up this video if you
