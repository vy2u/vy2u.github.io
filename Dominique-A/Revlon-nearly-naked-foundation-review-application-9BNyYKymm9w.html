today and I'm stopping by today to do a
review on my Revlon nearly naked
foundation in the color cappuccino 290
and I've been wearing this foundation
for about two weeks now
and I absolutely love this foundation
it's almost like a tinted moisturizer
which is like a very light light light
makeup on your face nothing very heavy
and I absolutely love this makeup guys
like I know a lot of people are raving
about this and people are getting
reviews about this on YouTube
so I decided to jump on the bandwagon
and I went out and purchased this and I
love this makeup it's really nice very
light finish it does really make your
skin that oily I have oily skin I
usually use my Mac's finishing spray
after I do my makeup so and I carried
that travel-size was being around
everywhere I go so I can just give
myself a nice touch up and I do actually
use my bentonite towpath product to set
my foundation after I'm done so
therefore it doesn't really kind of like
get all crazy looking so it kind of
stays on my face because I set the
foundation after I wear it um I've been
getting a lot of compliments I've been
wearing this for two weeks it's really
good I like it what I was using previous
to this was the Maybelline's
air foam foundation and the air foam
foundation it was good but um I kind of
felt like that foundation was a bit
sticky and this one is very lightly very
late like I said I also was using the BB
cream and that was kind of like a lesser
like it's kind of cheaper it was kind of
sticky also I really didn't like that
one as much but this one to me is
probably better and I actually used all
the red I usually like using Revlon
foundations I don't know why I just like
them they have a better hold and they
look way better on the skin one thing I
noticed about this is that this is very
light so pick women of darker skin
complexions I just barely made the cut
because I'm a dark skin and this just
barely barely like landed on my skin
like perfectly so I got lucky but I this
is another cappuccino foundation I don't
have and this is a Revlon Photoready
foundation and there's a big difference
because this one is way darker than this
one is and I don't know why but um you
see I use this too sometimes when I'm
going out from taking pictures or
something like that I use this one but
for some reason this
is way darker than this one maybe
because it's like a tinted moisturizer
or something but I don't know it's kind
of fishy so they might want to check out
the products and stuff like that because
it really doesn't make that much sense
because this one your problem I'm
probably matching my skin way better and
this one I'm just making the mark so
it's kind of awkward but um it works so
it doesn't matter to me so what I'm
gonna do is apply the foundation on this
side of my face as you can tell I have
blemishes and I didn't plan this out of
my face I did conceal the bottom of my
eye and do my lids in my eyebrow and put
my lashes on so that's finished so I'm
gonna put the blush and bronzer on this
side and finish the look and if you guys
are wondering with how to lip call and
have on my lips
this color is NYX from much and it's NYX
soft matte cream lip colors and this
color is SML c10 Monte Carlo so this is
really nice red lipstick for girls of
darker complexions or even lighter
complexion it doesn't really matter it
doesn't discriminate but this is
probably the best lipstick that I ever
had in red because it has like a matte
finish and it makes your lips looks like
so juicy and pretty so I like that I
don't know and this probably like the
best red lipstick that I've ever
purchased so you know I'm rocking with
this for now
it's amazing guys so amazing so I bought
this from Hartman's for about six
dollars so you guys should try to well
even if you order online it's about the
same price so you guys should try to
jump on this one because this one is
amazing and I freaking love it so now
I'm gonna I'm gonna do the foundation
for you guys to show you guys what it
looks like I'm just gonna put my hair
back I'm going to use a splat foundation
brush just a regular foundation brush I
got on a kit for Christmas from one of
my BFFs so it was just a flat foundation
brush and what I do is I apply it on the
back of my hand and I just put like a
small amount on the back of my hand
nothing big because I'm only doing half
of my face so this is like a bar all you
need you don't even need that much so so
all I'm gonna do is just put it on the
back of my brush and just apply it on my
face I'm trying to get the blemishes
so you guys can see I'm trying to fix it
all the way up here and you could tell
the difference already because before
you could see the blemishes a lot on
this side but now is starting to
disappear if you want to get up on the
temporal part and open here which is
kind of like my problem area to up over
here is where my problem air is that so
I'm gonna make sure I get that and
excuse my extremely large forehead guys
but you guys know my forehead is super
mondo so you know bear with me so I'm
trying to get this all into my face so
you guys can see what it looks like I
 love this sorry guys for
cussing but I love this foundation guys
it's amazing it's so pretty so you see
that you can see the difference already
now now this is like really blending
together so what I'm gonna do now is
take my toe past been my topaz bentonite
powder and I'm gonna put it on the back
of the cap did you guys to see what it
looks like I already showed you guys
what it looks like on the last review
and I'm gonna take a fluffy brush and
I'm just gonna put a little bit on my
fluffy brush but I'm gonna set the
foundation like I said guys already
conceal my face and I did learn from my
last video that my concealer was a bit
light and I hope you guys can see now
that I've been improving on that one so
it's looking a little bit better now
it's not too much of a dramatic dramatic
highlight and I hope you guys can see
that because the bentonite pad has been
helping me out with the highlight and
the highlight has been coming out
looking extraordinarily pretty okay so I
set the foundation guys now I'm gonna
use my Milani baked bronzer and it's
about to be done and I've showed you
guys this before it's to the rim now
it's almost gone nice to see that and
this is number
oh five soldi think I believe there's
all this gunk on the back or whatever so
I'm gonna apply this bronzer on my
cheeks
I just do some simple strokes it kind of
defines the cheeks a little bit of you
guys can start seeing that right now and
the last thing I use is my black
radiance baked blush and this is amazing
this isn't the color warm berry and it's
number eight 305 and you can see my
makeup products are like crazy so this
is what it looks like it's a pretty
berry color love love love this
expression with red lips it kind of
gives you like this really cute look so
this is what it looks like guys you see
that just put it on those apples of your
cheeks and that's it guys and like I
said I use my Mac finishing product
finishing spray and I just spread my
fins for them let us shake it out a
little bit so I can air dry and once
it's dry then you're finished and you
guys let see right now look at that I've
gotten the foundation to sit very nicely
and you can see this side this set has
been previously done and it's absolutely
gorgeous and it's been sitting there for
a while so if I didn't make you believer
today guys check out someone's else
someone else's channel or video on this
because I'm a believer and helping us
and see how gorgeous is foundation is
and I wear this all day and I kid you
guys not this foundation lasts all
freaking day and it's just amazing so
the foundation is set on both sides and
you can see I match both sides off so
this is the completed look guys and this
is my review on the Revlon on the Revlon
nearly naked foundation it is absolutely
amazing
you guys can test it out for yourself it
was only seven dollars and forty four
cents at Walmart or any drugstore it'll
be I mean obviously warmer would be
cheaper than anything so try to go to
Walmart or Target so this is it I'm
spending seven thousand forty four cents
on this and this is like very good I
like it so far until they start
something bring something else out and I
probably jump on that one too but for
now this is perfect for me and it might
just be perfect for you guys so I advise
you guys to go out and buy this product
