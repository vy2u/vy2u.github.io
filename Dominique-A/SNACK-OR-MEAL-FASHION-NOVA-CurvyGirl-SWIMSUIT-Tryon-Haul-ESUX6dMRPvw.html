another curvy /sit girl trying out video
so today's video is sponsored by fashion
over comm so today's video is going to
be a swimsuit Rhonda haul so I will
leave everything down below if you're
interested in purchasing anything from
this website and if you're interested in
seeing what I have to offer in today's
try and haul guys I would like you to
stay tuned and keep on watching alright
guys so the first one shoot I'm gonna
show you guys it's super duper cute so
this is a high-waisted bikini set guys
so it is black now for this charm haul
guys I noticed that I picked a lot of
black stuff out so please bear with me
so these are really cute guys so these
are high-waisted now this has a great
high waisted it's not it has like a high
leg guys but it's not too much of a high
high leg it's just bright now it has
this nice gold hardware right here with
the crisscross string now these strings
are real so you can definitely pull it
to make it tighter and then I think if
you pull it and make it tighter actually
be a high high leg kind of bottom and
that actually would be really cute I'm
probably going to try that out now
definitely has a pretty decent back side
too so definitely cover like a good
portion of your back side to give you a
nice curvature which i think is great
these are stretchy guys I got my dentist
size extra large and mine's actually fit
pretty good I could have actually sized
up to 1x to be honest with you guys
because it does have a give but it's not
a huge gift
now the bikini top is nice as well - I
don't know what I got on this I got some
type of mess on this but we're going to
disregard that it has the same gold
hardware with the crisscross string that
goes up you can either make it wide open
or make it real close the coolest part
about this is the bikini has freaking
racerback and I love Razorbacks because
it gives you like a full coverage feel
but it has like a cool look to it
so I definitely thought this was great
the cup size is lined and padded and
it's pretty stretchy as well - I got an
extra large my boobs are about like a
38d I think they are now I'm yeah I
think so I'm not sure though so yeah so
I fit pretty good in this size extra
large
unfortunately fashion Nova doesn't do
Mitch match sizes which sucks so you
kind of have to take your chances when
you get this but the boob padding or the
breast area is pretty stretchy so if you
have larger breasts and I do this
probably would work for you just because
it's really stretch on the next
I'm gonna show you guys it's actually
really cute so this is super duper
tropical I feel like this is probably
one of the few colorful items that I got
from this website but you guys got to be
able to because I didn't realize that I
picked all that black stuff but to be
completely honest with you guys but
we're gonna push through so this is
really cute guys it's kind of like a
tropical style high-waisted high leg
bikini now one thing about this that I
wasn't really feelin that much guys is
that this didn't have support like
usually when you go as high waisted
bottoms or hiked leg bottoms or bikini
bottoms whatever sometimes you get the
ones that's made out of green material
so you have like a really good support I
just felt like these didn't have that
much support so it really exposed belly
a lot but I still liked it all not
thought it was really cute now the top
is a full like some crop top short
sleeve top style
low core whatever if I even said that
right whatever so um the cool thing
about this one the back does open up it
has like a nice little string that you
could tie in the back to give yourself a
little bit of a sex appeal the material
for this one is polyester and I wish it
wasn't polyester I wish it was kind of
like a polyester mix just because like I
said this one is real flimsy I don't
even know if this gets wet what its
gonna feel like what its gonna look like
so I don't know how I feel about this I
do like the color and stuff like that I
picked this one in a size extra large I
think I probably should have got a size
large in this because it probably would
have been a little bit tighter a little
bit more you know shaky and stuff like
that but all in all the material wise
I'm not a big fan of the polyester
material because it just doesn't give
you enough support but I think the
concept is pretty cute on this one so
this next one sue I got was a little bit
of a weird one for me now when I first
tried it on a few weeks ago was a little
bit too tight but then I ended up trying
it on again and then like trying to
figure out how it was structured and it
kind of fit nice so this is kind of one
of those bandage style swimsuits and
it's black now I got this one in a size
large
I probably should have got it extra
large but I was thinking that I was
gonna have a little bit of a give now it
has like this weird kind of like off the
shoulder type of look to it it does have
like mesh areas around it and then it
has kind of like that nice
bandage material around it it does have
a nice little detail side cuts on the
side give you like a little bit of a
look
the back goes and zips up all the way
it's a really nice swimsuit guys if you
want to like structured look it
definitely has a lot of sex appeal on
the front it shows a lot of stomach a
lot of boobs unfortunately this one just
did not fit me correctly guys for some
reason my boobs I had under boobs
with this one I don't know how I it was
just not working so I definitely the
size up to an extra-large in this one
but unfortunately I got a large and
either I lose like five pounds or just
deal with it now this next bathing suit
that I'm gonna show you guys it's really
cute so this is a one-piece bathing suit
now I got this in a size large and it
fits pretty good however the issue with
this one is I didn't realize that it had
like this many cuts I don't even
remember picking this out and that's the
crazy thing about it
so it has like the sides which has like
a thousand and a million cuts on the
side so a lot of your sides and your
back will be exposed in this swimsuit
there's only like this little front area
that'll cover like a little bit of your
front crotch area now I should have got
this in an extra large guys but
originally when I tried this on like two
weeks ago my fat on the side was like
really coming out so it did dim down a
little bit so that's a good sign guys
losing a little bit more weight but I
think this is nice the structure is nice
it has some padding in here which is
really weird but if you are someone that
has like hard nipples all the time like
me I think this helps sometimes but
sometimes it's uncomfortable and I just
take it out but you could definitely
pull these out now it does tie around
your neck it has a little bit of a
crisscross design in the front shows
like a little bit of boobage which is
cute the back is really nice as well too
guys the back actually comes up pretty
high and it still curves you out and you
look really good in this one I felt that
this was a really nice bathing suit I
should've gotten an extra large I don't
know why I picked in a large I was just
doing the most but overall I think this
is really cute for like a nice you know
Miami vacation little quick getaway or
whatever I think this will be really
more color guys so this sub suit is
really cute guys this is another bandage
style swimsuit that I saw on the website
and I picked this one out in a size
extra large and I should have got this
in a size large and I'll explain to you
guys why now it definitely carries like
really nice in the breast area my boobs
looked really good in this one it has
good support but for some reason
extra-large the straps on this one we're
just too big like they were kind of nuts
I wanted them to kind of sit on my body
and they just were sitting there so the
straps are a little too big guys and
then the worst part was the bottom was a
little bit too big as well I actually
had some folding areas on this swimsuit
like it sometimes would fold down I'm
like no so I should have got this in a
large it does go up your bosom so you're
gonna have this almost like a like a
semi thong I guess you can say but it
looks really nice I love this kind of
color I wanted some type of color for
the summertime so I thought this would
be a great bathing suit I'm definitely I
have to figure out what to do it's a
little bit loose in the bottom area and
then just the straps in the back are
loose but I can think I can make like
some minor alterations to it myself and
kind of get it where I need it to but it
definitely gives you like a snatch feel
I feel snatched in this I feel like
comfortable and it definitely
accentuates the right curves which is so
the next thing that I chose is a
cover-up guys they have this with a cute
cover-up to kind of remind me of that
bedroom cover-up that people have those
kind of like puffy sleeves and the puffy
bottom but obviously this is like a
beach cover-up so you don't need all
that extra drama so I thought thought
this was really cute I got this in a
size extra large and it fits pretty good
I could have sized large but I was
trying to play it safe and got the extra
large so it's see-through it's almost
kind of like one of those like really
cute sexy gown so I kind of thought like
who's gonna be cute like a bikini so I
really think that this is nice guys I
paired it off with that crisscross
bathing suit just because you know that
banks was a little bit extra you want to
cover it up it does have a string that
you could tie do your waist width and
just kind of give yourself that kind of
like sex appeal it's SuperDuper long
mine's actually touches the ground but I
think it's really nice if you want to
kind of have one of those kind of like
really revealing bikinis underneath and
then just put this on and just to walk
around in it if you want to kind of kind
of cover up if you know what I mean but
I thought that this was a really cute so
the last bathing suit that I'm gonna
show you guys is probably my favorite
because I saved it for last so this is a
one-piece bathing suit guys and it has
the sports illustrated writing on the
front of it now this is the perfect type
of double-minded bathing suit that you
will need like for the summer now it
topped it off with the sports
illustrated so it definitely made me
feel really like hot and this
embarrassing but yeah so I picked this
one out in a size a US 10 so this one
was a bathing suit that you actually had
to pick out in like numerical size
because I guess this one is from Sports
Illustrated it's probably yeah I guess
whatever so you have to pick it out in a
numerical so I got in a size 10 now this
actually fits really good guys it has
that double line of material that's
going to suck you up so it's it's ah
this is I wish everyone created bathing
suits like this like I would create a
bathing suit line made out of material
just like this because I know that this
is the type of material that bodies like
mines little stomachs like mines need so
I definitely would consider making a
swimsuit line with this type of material
it's double lined it's like the perfect
cut guys it doesn't cut too high we're
gonna have like a lot of vagina out or
anything like that it cuts really nice
and gives you just like a great shape
and then even the back of it the way it
cuts in low it's just oh my god I just
love it so much I feel super confident
in this I think it's like great even the
breast area is padded guys you have like
a little padded coverage it kind of fits
pretty good you know it's trying to get
my boobs to kind of situate in it but
overall guys this is by far one my
favorite ones it's definitely like the
epitome of Sports Illustrated body
everything body nice body positive
everything about this is so cool I
definitely think that out of all the big
Institute you guys saw today this is
probably be number one I think you
should go out and get this one because
it's definitely happen alright guys so
