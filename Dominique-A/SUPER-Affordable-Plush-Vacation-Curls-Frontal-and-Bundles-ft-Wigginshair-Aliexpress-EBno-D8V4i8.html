of it here guys and you guys can already
tell that I'm gushing over this hair I
freaking love this now vacation season
is definitely coming really quick and
you guys know next week I'm well in a
few days I'm going to New Orleans and
then the following Tuesday I'll be in
Thailand for 10 days so I was trying to
find like a hairstyle that I can wear
like on like a nice tropical island now
Thailand is definitely a little bit
humid and a little bit hot but if I'm
doing a lot of the like water activities
I'll be fine my hair like this because
it's just going to wave up it's gonna
kind of soak up the water it's gonna be
cute guys I freaking love this unit that
I made now wiggins hair set me 4 bundles
in here and they also sent me a frontal
they sent me a 20 inch front toe 20 22
and to 24 inch bundles guys and the hair
is like this is what you call plush
curls like this hair is so nice guys
like Aiko watched it here and I let it
air dry and I just kind of like dropped
it on the floor like kind of scrunched
it and dropped it on the floor for it to
be kind of like a scrunch method guys I
absolutely when I mean I'm exact I'm not
even exaggerating like do you guys see
how freaking beautiful these curls are
like look at the dynamics of these curls
right here now the hair has no products
in it whatsoever guys is just the one
psycho watch and let it air dry that's
just what it is
now look at how nice and plush these
curls are now this is perfect here guys
for a perfect example of transitioning
from from fall winter to spring and then
spring into summer it is a lot of hair
guys I did put all the bundles in and
it's like a complete full wig so it's
about 200% density it's pretty thick you
know I'm adding that said this is 200%
deci this one with 225-250 it is pretty
thick but I do like having like bigger
curly hair sometimes just because I hate
when you see get like gapping in the
back
this one is perfect it is a lot of hair
but I'm able to maintain this hair just
because the hair is super duper soft
guys when I mean soft oh my god
soft like this is definitely what I like
to call they
education hair if you guys are not
reading my vacation here like if you're
looking for some sexy curls I could just
imagine bathing suit on beach a time but
listen guys this this is it this this is
it like this is it and I review a lot of
Alex press based company based companies
and do reviews for them but let me
explain one thing to you guys that I
always say in the videos there are
sometimes you'll receive natural wave
hair and natural curly hair that type of
textured hair the curly hair and the
bundle and the frontal don't match now
this is one scenario and I'm gonna I'm
gonna say this right now I don't know if
I got the good batch but this is one
scenario where the bundles in the
closures match to a tee you cannot tell
me that this hair does not match like
look at this guy guys like oh such an
obsession guys it's just such an
obsession I absolutely love this here
guys I will leave all the information
down below I've had the hair for about a
day or two now so I will come back and
update you because I really really
believe that this hair is going to be
the hair for me this summer so I'm going
to come back and update you guys do not
expect me to carve this hair do not
expect me to do anything crazy with this
here because I just love it the way it
is simple like this beautiful natural
perfect bomb calm so guys like I said
