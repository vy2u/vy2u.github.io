review so now this review is on this wig
that I'm wearing today and this wig I
picked up from sister wigs calm and I
was not sent this wig for review I
reviewed it for myself just because I
wanted to try something different and I
know like braids and like twists and
stuff or becoming something that's cool
now and something that's in and I did
walk braids in the summertime with my
shape size and I really liked it so I
wanted to kind of reinvent it or redo it
up again so I decided to purchase this
way and this week is a cynical locs and
this is from Empress lace wigs and this
is the actual like piece of paper that
came in with the package and this is
obviously the girl and this is a year
that I got so basically this is a
synthetic unit and I did see a couple
reviews on YouTube for this unit and
that's basically one reason why I wanted
to actually purchase the unit to test it
out for myself
this unit is kind of different guys it's
not like a lace wig where you're gonna
have like mad parting space it's not
like that for this one either jit had to
work my way through this way because you
have to try your hardest to make it look
realistic because when you get it it
looks crazy so basically what I had to
do was twist out all of the front of the
hair I did open some parting space up
hair this part the parting space is very
minimal you're not going to get like
three inches you probably get like a
half an inch to two inches which is not
a lot I did have to maneuver my way
around and like I said if you see the
twist right here I had to go and retwist
everything in the front compared to the
back twists which are jumbled as a
the toys in the front are miniature golf
because I did go in and have to retwist
the front by myself but I like I
absolutely love this wig I never liked
honestly the wig game has come a long
way the good thing about this is that
you can base whenever you get in box
which in turn to use synthetic hair
anyways so therefore it's not like you
have to pay that much money for it I
purchase yourself a sister wigs calm and
I pay sixty 9.99 if you try to go on
other websites of other websites like
black hairspray and those types
website they were marked at almost
90,000 I was like no way so I kind of
like waited while shopped around and
then I landed on this price so of course
when I saw for $69.99 I was like I'm not
going to I'm not going to let this go so
I purchase it right away basically like
I said I had to be twist the hair on the
front hair off so basically I just use
the eco styler gel to actually twist the
hair I don't know what you used to twist
braids or whatever or braids but I use
the Ecostar gel because I thought the
Eco style gel was good enough for me to
actually twist my hair so I use the eco
styler gel and it does frizz up a little
bit but it is that kink along here okay
so me saying right it's that type of
hair so therefore I do use the
l'oréal's Lockett weather control
hairspray just to kind of tame the hair
down little ball as you guys can see in
the back it start to kind of frizz up a
little bit but I kind of feel like it
doesn't matter because it's supposed to
be part of the look um you can style it
like pulling it back like this and do
like cute little styles I actually
prefer the hair to be more towards the
face face forward because I feel like it
looks so nice and it looks like so like
chic and Afrocentric you can wear with
hats and everything like that I just
really really really like this hairstyle
guys and like I said it did come with
baby hairs around the perimeter but some
of the baby hairs were a little bit
straight so you got to be kind of you're
kind of like about that so I do kind of
like kind of like push some out a little
bit crinkle them up put a little bit of
gel on it to give it a little bit of
style but other than that this is what
the hair good looks like it's about 24
inches guys um it's like really long and
the ends are cut up straight if you do
twist the hair out and you want in the
hair starting to come peel apart like on
the come apart you can actually dip this
in hot water just to keep it together I
didn't do that because the eco styler
gel I made sure I twisted them really
good but like I said when you first get
this way don't think I'm just going to
pop the wig on your head and be gone
with it because you're not you really
have to use your hair skills or your
skills of styling to actually get this
to look the way you want I'm not sure if
they have these in different different
colors they probably do have different
colors but I got mines in the color one
because I just want it to be jet black
and be more like boom pow
there are a lot of other ladies that did
reviews on this wig as well and they did
justice to the wig I just feel like if
you're going to buy this wig you need to
make sure that you're willing to work
with it I did have to work with it for a
couple hours just to make sure that it
looked realistic and when I went out I
got so many compliments on this way some
people didn't even know that it was a
wig this is really really cute guys so
um I'll leave all the informations out
for you guys below like I said I was a
sentence wig for a review I purchased
this with my own money and I'm giving
you guys my honest opinion because this
 came out looking crazy I would've
been blowing up the roof right now but
it looks really good and I want to make
sure that you guys know that and if you
guys are interested in purchasing this
way just check out sister wigs comm cuz
right now I think it actually went down
on price and is sixty seven ninety-nine
so that's about it guys I hope you guys
liked this review stay tuned for more
videos and I'll catch you guys later bye
