now it's now it's now it's now we
it's a leaper
gloves and got a bill got out a bit of
clubs and got a bill I've got my money
trip clubs and got a bill got a bit up
up and down up and down up and down the
floor if it's gonna banana Pro my trips
gonna banana
a banana banana
[Laughter]
alright guys so this is the finished
look of the hair once I've done all the
things I need to do to it so this unit
guys is from China lace wigs calm and
it's a really nice simple 360 wig now
when I say simple 360 wig guys I mean
really simple 360 wig so with this unit
guys I didn't have to do too much with
it to kind of get it to look this cute
now it did cut it did come pre pluck so
when it comes pre plucked you really
don't have to do too much to kind of get
the hairline to be realistic so with
this weight I decided to just do a
middle part style I usually do curve a
part to stuff like that but I want to
kind of switch it and just do a middle
part style with this unit my hair is
kind of like a number one be one in a
way so it is a little bit dark and I do
like it against my skin because it just
gives me more of a striking look now you
can't go in and dye this whatever color
you want but I just kept it at the base
color it came in this unit is about 20
inches long guys it's almost like a 22
to me I'm not gonna say that it's 20 and
then it's not so I will leave it actual
specs in the video or I'll leave it down
below for you guys as well but I do
think it's a nice wig guys it is a silky
straight texture and I'm not the biggest
fan of silky straight textures so what I
did was just added like a nice soft curl
with my curling iron in it and I just
added a little bit of that got to do a
freezing spray just to kind of hold the
wave a little bit I don't like my curls
to be too curled so I like them to be
kind of loose and wavy so that's the
look I was going for with this unit now
it is about 150% density so it's not
gonna be your greatest density but if
you're able to manage it with like a
styler with the curls and stuff like
that you're gonna definitely bulk up the
density that way so I would say you can
worry straight but I would opt to wear
it like in a curl style if you're
someone that likes a thicker density but
other than that guys I think it's nice
to has a beautiful luster it's very soft
like SuperDuper soft I definitely like
this look it kind of reminds me of
Leticia I think that's her name I'm not
gonna butcher name she's Australian
modeled that models for a fashion OVA I
don't know I kind of had like this whole
entire vibe that this looked kind of
looked like something she would actually
wear here like this and like the makeup
and stuff like that so I don't know if
I'm kind of jumping
right now by saying that but she has a
youtube channel as well I'm kind of feel
like I kind of look like the
african-american version of her but yeah
so I definitely had those vibes and I
did this I just I don't know the hair is
very nice it's a simple wig like I said
it's nothing crazy it is 360 if you want
a unit like this I would say I would
probably get into lace front version
just because you don't really need the
back to do a pony tail
although it can do a pony tail so if
you're someone that wants to do 360s and
wants to wear ponytails high buns and
stuff like that then that's the type of
way you need to purchase for me I like
to be simple so I'll take the three
inches of parting three it's about three
or four inches of parting space in the
front and I'll just wear as a lace front
that way it's just easier for me that
way so guys I will leave all the
information down below if you're
interested in purchasing this baby from
China lace wigs calm do not forget guys
