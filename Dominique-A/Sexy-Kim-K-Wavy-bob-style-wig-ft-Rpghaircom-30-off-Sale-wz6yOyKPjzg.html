Wednesday now in today's video I'll be
showing you guys wig from a company
called RPG here wait calm now this
wisdom show you guys is their kim k
inspired wavy bob style wig and it is 14
inches long
now this wig is constructed like all
your other wigs it has three combs at
the top it has two on the sides and one
at the base it also has one common the
back one adjustable strap and it is a
very stretchy unit so it is big head
friendly now it is a wavy texture and
I'm not sure if it's machine pressed to
be this wavy or it's like a natural wave
so what I'm going to do is try to solve
this by wetting it diffusing it and
letting it air dry a little bit or kind
of like playing around with it so
therefore I don't have to use heat
products to it to make it look nice so
that's we're going to do because it is
supposed to be a Kim K wavy style bob so
let's see if it lives up to the name now
it does have baby hairs around the
perimeter and the hairline is pretty
good it looks like they kind of pre
plucked it for me so I don't have to do
anything to it I am NOT going to go this
down I'm just going to put it down in
style and see what it looks like and
then I'll see if it's going to be my
wigs for the week my weight for the week
but it's really nice as about three
inches of parting space and they
actually part of this wing to the side
so I'm going to wear this as a side part
and I'm just going to open the part up a
little bit because that part is way too
small for me I like my parts to be like
at least right here
so I'm going to open the part up a
little bit and add some Prescott on it
to make it look nice so if you're
interested in seeing what this unit
looks like I would like you to stay
tuned and keep on less
alright guys so this is what the hair
looks like I just kind of played around
with it I was going to defuse it before
but then I was like I don't want to want
to defuse it because they're just kind
of shrink up the curls the waves so what
I decided to do is just let it air dry a
little bit so this is what it looks like
completely I guess is when they talk
about the Kim Khaled I guess this is
close enough to it what I would say so
if you're going like to amusement park
or like you go into like the beach or
like some kind of real tropical area I
think that this hair would actually work
for trip like that just because it's not
long so it's not going to be bothering
you like on your back or anything like
that and it is wettable so you can just
go swim with it and come out I did add
some pressed powder and I usually use my
BH Cosmetics contour palette to powder
contour out to add a powder and I do
kind of curve the line a little bit over
so it can be a little bit more longer I
just put a little bit of the can to
leave in conditioner cream into my hair
just because what wavy hair curly hair
kind of defines it a little bit more so
I just put a little bit on it just to
give it a little bit more of a defined
wave pattern when it's air drying but
for now I think it's cute it's not a
long unit lads it's 14 inches long let
me turn to the back to show you guys the
back so it's about that long and I just
think that it looks really cute guys
it's a very simple hairstyle like I said
if you're going on a vacation and you
don't want long long hair to get in the
way you want something cute short and
fun that you guys can easily wet go so
we let it get wet air dry it out and
then just kind of like make sure you pat
this top dog fix it up a little bit and
you're basically good to go
I think that this hairstyle is perfect
for that it is more of like a sexy wet
look so he doesn't get away with like a
lot of outfits with this is just like
really sexy and I can see where they got
the Kim K inspired look for him so I
definitely think this is a cute one for
the summer it's the first time I've ever
had like a wet and wavy style bob that
is sure well when my wavy style hair
that's short this wing so yeah
in my ear just went out of my house god
