sporting today is from oMG her hair calm
so this is basically their 10 inch curly
style Bob unit now this is just a lace
front wig it's not a 360 anything like
that so you only get a little bit of
parting space in the front so basically
what I did with this unit guys is I went
and I kind of tweeze the front just
because I wanted to open it up a little
bit so that it looked more realistic for
you guys I also had a pot around the
perimeter and in the parting space right
here the parting space is about two and
a half inches of parting space so it's
not super duper like extremely a lot but
it's okay for what you need to do so
basically what this hairstyle this time
I kind of switch it up and do something
different which I rarely do so I just
kind of twisted the hair back going to
have in the back and just leave a little
bit of here in the front it is ten
inches long so you're not working with a
lot of hair so it's easier to manage
this hairstyle honestly and truly so
what I did with this one is I wet it up
and showed you guys how I kind of got
the products to sit in it so basically I
used a Cantu a locking twist leaving
conditioner and I also used a little bit
argon oh and I mix it into my spray
bottle and I saturated my entire head to
finish the look off I did go in with
some more of the LOC and is it called
lock and seal lock and seal or whatever
can - a leave-in condition I put it in
after and let the hair dry for about ten
minutes so this is the finished look
after its dried up and it's really
really nice like I said guys this unit
is very lightweight so you're not
working with a lot of hair and it's like
a really minimalist hairstyle so if
you're someone that doesn't have time to
be to use like a lot of eating tools on
your hair to get a style this style is
really actually simple this is a great
work style - like if you're going to
working any like a real quick leg a real
quick look I think this is really nice
clean and it's just a very simple look
it's not ultra glam or whatever but I
mean not everyone can go for that Ultra
Glen long 28 and share all the time even
though we sometimes wish we could but
it's not realistic so I feel like this
unit is one of those realistic units
that can be like an everyday unit so I
definitely consider getting this unit if
you're someone that doesn't have the
ability or have the time to deal with
like a big curly long or
that kind of messy stuff but if you
don't have the time for that this unit
actually will work I did not receive any
shedding or tangling from this hair at
all I did show you guys what the back
looks like it's very nice short and like
I said you're not having all this hair
down your back and it's just something
very simple that is definitely a
transitional wig from winter spring to
summer so you definitely have to keep
that in mind so I will leave all the
information down below for you guys if
you guys are interested in this baby
that I'm wearing today do not forget
guys to thumbs up this video leave your
comments down below subscribe and share
this video with your friends of family
people and I will catch you guys in a
later one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
