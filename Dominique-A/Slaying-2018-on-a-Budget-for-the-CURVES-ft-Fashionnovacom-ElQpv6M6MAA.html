with another Kirby slash stick girl
trying haul video so today's video guys
is sponsored by fashion over comm now I
will link all the items down below for
you guys if you guys are interested in
purchasing anything from this website so
in today's video I try to do a little
bit of a different thing I try to show
you guys pieces that I normally would
not wear some things did work and
something just didn't work so I will
kind of talk to you guys about and how I
felt like everything I pick out is not
gonna be like the greatest but if you
have a different body type and if you
feel like you can rock it you go ahead
and do that the material for me some of
the material wasn't as quality materials
I would have liked which kind of cause
the outfits not to work as well I did
size up in a lot of stuff but I noticed
that when I sized up I either made the
right choice to size up I made the wrong
choice to size up and even the regular
size that I got the items were like mini
on me so it was just kind of like almost
kind of like a hit and I'm like a hit in
a Miss so I don't know you guys will see
if you want to see everything that I had
to offer in this video guys just stay
tuned to keep on watch alright guys so
I'm gonna jump right into the video
because it's probably gonna be a bit a
little bit longer than usual so I did do
kind of like suits are pieces this time
like top and bottom pieces I did do a
lot of dresses because I was trying to
think I was thinking more of like a New
Year's theme or whatever but it's
already New Year's in two days so it's
kind of like a shorter later video you
know shipping all that kind of stuff
takes a while so I got to keep that in
mind so I hope I apologize if you were
looking for New Year's dress and you
didn't get in time I believe if you
order today you maybe even may be able
to get it tomorrow so that's just kind
of a thing that you have to kind of keep
in mind but I do have some kind of New
Year's inspired dresses or just dresses
for any occasion that you guys have
coming up other than New Year's not
everyone goes up for New Year's Eve I'm
just going to karaoke for New Year's
Eves just because I just don't go out
like that anymore and my boyfriend is
working um he's working at night so I'm
just gonna go out then we're gonna I'm
gonna go back home and I meet him after
like so it's just kind of different for
me I feel like when you get older you
just kind of like like drift out of the
going outside club and stuff like that
so I just haven't been doing that I
haven't done that for two years now so
it's just kind of like huh
and thank you for everyone to say happy
birthday to me my birthday was on
Wednesday the 27th December 27th 2000
teen that made me 27 so is my golden
here I guess well would this be my goes
in here I don't know but I turned 27 on
what and say so thank you for any ones
that said happy birthday to me that was
really sweet really sweet so the first
stop and I'm gonna show you guys is a
two piece set now this one I actually I
don't know if I've seen anyone with I'm
pretty sure someone about it but I
haven't seen anyone review this yet I'm
not sure let me not say that shut up
town so this one I thought was really
cute guys now it's like it's like the
perfect two-piece now I'm sized up in
this one because I picked out a
two-piece last time and I asked for one
axe and they send me an extra-large and
I just felt really confined in it so I
tried to size to extra-large to 1x with
my clothes large I did get one item here
and large I actually work with so
surprising but hey sometimes it's gonna
work and sometimes not I'm a bit I'm a
bit chunky now so I definitely have to
kind of extend my sizes a little bit
just because I'm getting a little fluff
but this time I sized up and this isn't
a 1x I could have got an extra-large but
I wanted to keep play safe and just try
to have more of a relaxed look I don't
always like to be really overly tight in
my clothes and stuff like that so I
tried to keep that in mind picking this
one out so this is kind of like a pinch
strain you call it pinch Drive it's like
a black and white striped um kind of
like duster jacket it's really oversized
it doesn't come with an under piece so
you basically have to wear your own
undergarment underneath it like things
like a bra let and we're kind of like a
little like a mini brawl at like a
playing brawl that I didn't want to gila
extravagant with like style and stuff
like that so I did like a mini brawl
that underneath this and it's really
nice it's really long basically it's
almost kind of like an oversized kind of
loungewear slash slash two-piece it's
kind of weird it's not weird it's
actually really cute and sexy which I
like and it's very simple so it's very
long guys it doesn't have pockets which
is annoying it doesn't have like a
button to button it up if you want to
you can get like a nice satin black belt
and kind of tie it together that would
actually be really cute but it doesn't
have pockets it doesn't have any of that
stuff so you definitely gonna have to
carry on a clutch or a side bag and you
guys know I like my crossbody bags
they're like my favorite the pants are
really cute as well to guys but like I
said the pants don't even have pockets
either they definitely need to hook
these pants up my pockets
sometimes you just want to put your
hands in something and when I caught
myself trying on this clothes I cut
myself trying to put my hand put my hand
in my pocket and I'm like yo there's no
pocket down what are you doing that's
just something that pants should come
with and that's kind of like common
sense when it comes to clothes I feel
like they should know that already but
not everybody knows that and not
everybody's with it
but I definitely would appreciate these
hat pants how many pockets so these are
really nice they do have like a stretchy
band on them so if you're like stomach
heavy or bottom heavy or whatever it's
gonna really sit nice they are a little
bit oversized for me so I definitely
decides down to extra-large but like I
said I want to be comfortable in my
clothes I don't want to be tight and
like you know real stuffed up like a
sausage so I thought that this look
really nice it is like I said it's just
a simple little piece to put together it
doesn't have to be high-fashion it does
have to be like all frou-frou and stuff
like that I just thought it was really
nice and simple so I picked this one out
and I'm actually really pleased with
this outfit I actually like this outfit
like the most well there's a there's
another few this is one of my what am I
chopped alright guys so I'm gonna show
you guys two dresses that I got Nunda
both of these dresses are black and I
actually like these dresses when I saw
them on the website now the funny thing
about fashion Nova guys and I know a lot
of you guys noticed is they use models
on their website that are kind of like
unrealistic looking like like I wished
it was like on the plus size section now
they do kind of give us some plus-size
models but they're like the plus-size
models that they have they're plus-size
but some of them aren't really plus-size
I feel look like regular regular regular
girls honestly and I know you guys are
looking at me like I'm regular regular
girl but honestly have like a big
stomach I like a big ass like I'm just
joking but like I'm not perfect you know
I'm saying so when you're buying this
stuff on the website especially if
you're buying it in the average size
will what they call normal size like the
meat this extra small to large size or
extra large that girl on the thing that
they have it's completely just
unrealistic to me like so I picked out
this dress and it looked really good on
her so I'm like you know what let me try
it out I got this one this size extra
large and I'm like okay it's gonna fit
so it did fit guys but like I said these
dresses I don't know how tall the girls
are on the website I'm sure the girls
like 5 feet or maybe 411 because there's
no way we're the same height
the dresses stopped on them at a perfect
length when I put the dress on me it was
so short so it's kind of like come on
like how tall are they like how really
how tall are these girls I feel like the
plus-size models are tall but then like
the regular size models they're short
like and you know it's funny one of the
models on one of the fashion model Nova
models that I've seen I actually saw her
at a club one time in LA when I went out
so and I actually saw her she was like 5
feet 411 so it's kind of like this is
really unrealistic you're gonna buy the
dress and think that it's gonna fit you
the same way and it's not like it's just
not so this dress that guy it's like a
really cute dress I only like this
because that's some shoes out one day
and I thought that it was gonna work so
the dress is a black dress and then it
has like this nice furry panel on the
front it is mesh so you do have like a
little bit of a sex appeal so I call
it's long sleeve and it is a mini dress
now this one to me is short but it's not
too too short compared to another dress
that I have so this one I can tolerate
like to an extent however I just kind of
feel like the way it just look different
like the material look different on the
website when the girl had it on and then
when I got I put the material bit
cheaper it's not dense enough it's the
type of material that you all your nooks
and crannies are gonna show in so it was
just a little bit deceiving on the
website because you think you're gonna
get this and then you're not gonna get
it so I do like the concept of the dress
but other than that just kind of feel
like the material is just not the
material that I thought it should be but
I do like the cut of the concept of the
dressed a little full the little there's
this fur trim on the breast area the
mesh concept I thought that was cute it
does fit really good is really nice but
then again like I said it's too short so
therefore you're walking and you're
having to pull down that's annoying
that's just too annoying
now the next dress I got is black as
well now this one I actually like a lot
and this one was actually priced very
well is only $20 and I actually got this
one in a size large that's funny so this
one actually fit very nice very great on
the body if I felt comfortable on it but
here's the catch this one is see-through
AF now I thought this dress was really
cute it has in the front of its iconic
like an off-the-shoulder style dress and
the middle of the dress it has like this
nice ruching area which were really kind
of
is accentuate your body a lot which I
really like about the dress
however the dress is see-through AF so
all aspects of your buttocks will be
exposed in this dress that I cannot
tolerate guys like the dress is really
cute it's something I wear I would wear
this in the dark at a party in the dark
in the dark not in public in the
daylight like your entire look and
crannies are gonna be out everyone will
be able to see all the dents and dimples
in your like just it's a no for me but
if I had like a long jacket to wear over
it and you know what I'm gonna wear I'm
gonna wear with a long jacket and then
when I decide to take the jacket off I
will be sitting down where my butt won't
be shown but I do like to dress I like
the concept it's a really nice soft
let's hear it's definitely sexy I kind
of feel like it's just a little too
inappropriate if you were like
high-waisted seamless briefs or
something like seamless briefs where you
won't be able to see it maybe that'll
work but because it's just a see-through
the see-through that you guys know what
I'm talking about you can't wear this
like that so I would definitely
recommend putting over a long jacket
over or duster but other than that it's
very nice this accentuates occurs really
well and it's a really pretty dress and
this one was awesome I got this one in a
size large and it was only $20 like you
cannot beat that now I wonder what the
other cost looks like how see-through
are the other colors that this black
wanna see through like what would the
white dress look like a mess so the next
dress I got guys I really really liked
it when I first got it now this dress
when you initially get it you pick it
out it does come with an attachment
brief on the bottom I got this dress in
a size extra large and the extra large
size is actually really good this just
definitely has a nice stretch too and
it's like this really cute mesh pattern
with like this blue sequins like I like
this and when I first thought just
because reminding me of New Year's um
like I said is it's really cold and I'm
not wearing a dress on New Year's just
because it's way too cold outside and
like it's already December and on the
East Coast we're at like 14 degrees
negative 1 9 degrees I'm just not doing
that so I probably said this for a
different occasion when it comes to
springtime maybe like a nice little
spring gathering I have some - a baby
shower because
too much but whatever occasion that I
have coming up eventually in the
springtime I'll probably wear this dress
but I got this in a size extra large and
it did come with an attachment brief on
the bottom of it
now the attachment brief clasp was
absolutely diaper booty style like I
just did not let those briefs they were
really saggy and I understand the whole
concept of having a dress being an
extra-large dress and you want to give
the person an extra-large bottom but the
bottoms were really diapering and I just
did not like it like I honestly and
truly did not like them at all I felt
like I had like a diaper butt in it so I
just cut them out I cut the briefs out
and I just wore this with just my
regular shapewear now this dress guys
honestly it's mesh but you can't really
see anything at all so if you want to
wear your regular shapewear underneath
it you'll get away with it with no
problem I didn't wear a bra with it just
because I'm like I really need to wear a
bra with this it just doesn't really
matter it's really nice guys and it's a
little bit itchy and it rubs you kind of
funny though which is kind of annoying
so just keep that in mind because of the
sequence pattern is definitely to rub
you a little funny but I do like the
whole concept of this dress I think that
is cute and sexy and the color is just a
really nice color the blue and the kind
of tan so I really really like this and
like I said I got this in an extra-large
and I took a risk with the extra large
because sometimes I get extra larges
from fashion OVA they don't fit but this
one actually fit pretty well so I was
pretty pretty pretty pleased with this
and I was pretty happy now the next
thing I'm gonna show you guys is a cute
jumpsuit that I got now I did that I got
honey Jo I got one jump suit yeah I got
one jump soon you'll see so this
jumpsuit that I got I actually really
liked it it's like a tuxedo style
jumpsuit now this is what I probably
wear on New Year's Eve just because it
has pants and it's not a dress it's not
short and most of my body will be
covered up in the cold I'll probably
just go ahead and change the belt on
this one and add a leather jacket on
just to make a little bit cool and maybe
some boots or like something different
just to close the outfit up a little bit
now it's really cute it's a tuxedo style
jumps you guys and it definitely has a
nice plunge area in the breast area now
you guys wanna feel about fashion always
plunges this plunge on this jumpsuit is
not bad at all guys this
time to plunge work now I've told this
jumpsuit in a size 1x guys and I'm gonna
tell you right now the 1x and I've
chosen this jumpsuit was well done if I
would have gotten this jumpsuit in an
extra-large it would not have fit like
this 1x is not a 1x this is what X is an
extra-large in my mind so if you're
gonna pick this jumpsuit out I highly
recommend you go ahead and you size up
because if you have thighs but stomach
arms legs like whatever it's just not
going to fit and that's I'm being
completely honest with you guys so this
is what it looks like it's a black
jumpsuit and it does have like a little
wrist about it has like a little belt in
the front of it I don't really like the
belt guys which is I don't it's not
weird I just don't like the belt the
belt to me is a little bit cheesy it's
not like fashionable and it just doesn't
have the look that I was going for so
I'm gonna take the belt off and just put
another belt on it like a more
fashionable belt on just to kind of you
know close it off it in a little really
give it a little bit of ass down fat so
I'm definitely gonna have to get a belt
so when I when I go to the city I'll
just go to the store and try to pick up
some some type of fashionable belt I
can't even go thrifting if you want to
if you go to Goodwill you'll find some
really nice classic kind of cool belts
so I probably go to the goodwill find a
belt there because I'm just not gonna
wear that about that belts ugly so I'll
probably find about to put with this and
they just put a leather jacket on top of
it and like some nice heels like some
regular low baby heels because I do not
do like 4 or 5 inch heels because it
just doesn't work for me it's
unrealistic if I'm gonna be it's just
not gonna happen but I thought this was
cute it is kind of they did um brother
Friday they did add like a little
thought it looks like it's pleat else
not pleated this up later I lied I lied
I just need to go in guys and just kind
of steam me a little bit just cause it's
a little bit wrinkled so it's that type
of material that you put in the Machine
and wash it's gonna shrink so be careful
when you're watching this one you
probably should just let it air dry
instead of drying it just because this
jumpsuit is the type that has that
material that's gonna shrink
instantaneously
but for New Year's Eve I think this is
really nice it's a classic look it is a
little sexy with the plunge line but
like I said if you put a jacket over and
kind of like D hype it a little bit
it'll be really nice it has a great
tuxie
style look and I just thought it was
really nice and simple and I like simple
I'm just gonna change it up with the bow
and then just be done with that one I
think this will really work for New
Year's Eve
now this next outfit is actually my
favorite and it is white so I'm not
gonna put it up to the screen so this
dress was one dress that they featured a
lot and I do like satin or like yes
satin material a lot so when I saw this
on the website they had different colors
and I was like you know what I'm gonna
go ahead and choose the white color
white to me is so pure it's so pretty
it's so nice and I thought that it would
be great dress for New Year's New Year's
Eve so I picked this one out like I said
I'm not gonna show them cuz it'll wash
me out but I'll just show you guys the
second nice satin material now this
dress guys was probably my favorite
outfit out of the entire while I lied I
have another one but this alpha is
actually one of my favorite outfits and
I just like this so much guys it's so
simple so pretty and so nice now I did
get some Julie with this one just
because I had a little bit of
inspiration from the website and the
dress is very simple that it will look
really nice so I picked out this kind of
nice necklace it's nice choker style
necklace very bedazzled very jeweled one
thing about fashion Nova's necklace is
that I don't like guys is that the part
where you're supposed to grab to
actually the actual part where you need
to hook it's so short I like a short
little end like this why don't they add
an extender on it so therefore you're
not pulling at the base that is one
thing that pisses me off about these
decals it just gets on my nerves so I
just wish they had a little bit more of
an extension on this clip instead of
just having it dangling from the base of
this it's just really hard to actually
yeah I know my nails are pretty freakin
long but like it's really hard to like
grab that piece around your neck and
pull it into the loop it's just
unrealistic so definitely need to work
on that one but I do like the necklace
it's kind of that gold with it's a
golden way no it's a gold with a lot of
diamonds in it so it's really pretty and
I'm a gold person but I love the diamond
accent to it with the dress it just
looks absolutely amazing I absolutely
love this outfit guys I did size up in
this dress I got this just in a 1x
I could have got an extra large but I
wanted to be safe because it's satin I
didn't know if I was gonna have a lot of
wiggle room in it I wanted to be safe
comfortable and nice
it is a little bit loose around the
waist area and I can I could go in and
get it like brought together brought in
for me but I probably think about that
one thing I did do the the plunge line
for me was absolutely way too long it
was all the way almost down to my belly
button I'm just like maybe it's because
the dress was too big but the the plunge
for me was just too inappropriate and
I'm just not like I told you guys I
don't care I'm just not about to walk
outside man I'm gonna not gonna
disrespect my man or deal in that what
stuff it's just too low like so I did
have to go in and just sew it up a
little bit to kind of close it in to
make it more of like a modest dip and if
you guys I always say this in all my
videos if you if you don't want to wear
something like that the definitely gonna
fix it don't just go out and wear and
blend oh it's not to beat I'm gonna wear
I'm not about to do that so I did have
to go and kind of saw it it a little bit
just to seal it up but I thought once I
sealed it up together it was amazing
just I felt like the glass princess
glass queen Cinderella I just so really
really pretty in this I thought it was
really nice and this is probably one of
my favorites as well yeah this is one of
my favorites I do have another one I'm
gonna show you guys it is so cute
alright guys so the next up that I'm
gonna show you guys is one of my
favorites now this one to me I just
really really liked and I got the
inspiration off of the website when I
went on the website and saw these pants
and this shirt and how the girls style
them together they didn't have it in the
plus-size styling version but I wanted
to see what it looked like on me I
absolutely love this entire - this
entire set so the first thing I got was
a body sue in the body suit is in a size
large now this one is from the regular
regular collection size I just picked it
up from them so it's this nice kind of
black bodysuit and I have makeup stains
on mine so god it's like a black
bodysuit guys and it has kind of like
the mesh arms so the arms are
see-through it does kind of have like a
nice kind of stretchy armband right here
so it's really comfortable and it will
stay right in place this the quality of
the top put to get the top the way they
make construct the top is excellent I
love it I had is she trying to button
down below it's kind of like the if it
was a fit but it was too short in some
spots I don't know if this was just
because the way my body settled but it
was just a little like hard to get to
clasp it together so I kind of had to
fiddle around it just to close myself up
but I got myself in it no I paired it
with these amazingly cute kind of like
khaki style bell-bottom pants and it
does have a black and a red stripe on
the side now the bottom of the pants are
freakin acute and you know what's funny
I'm really gonna bring this with me and
I might even have to wear this on New
Year's Eve just because together as an
outfit it is really really cute like
it's really really nice and just like a
simple makeup look a simple hairstyle
and then I'm done it's already freezing
outside
I don't have to get like I don't know
something about this just really really
is nice to me and it's a simple outfit
altogether it just like looks really
good so I might even I might even have
to hit that hit the streets with this
one honestly
and the bell-bottom pants are just so
statement piece that it looks so great
like I just like it a lot simple makeup
simple hair and that I'm good to go I
thought that this outfit was a winning
outfit guys definitely check these pants
out I believe I got these pants on the
size I believe they're size extra large
these pants are very yep I got these an
extra large but they're very very
stretchy pants and I had an experience
in the last Ron hall with some stretchy
pants a size extra large and it fit
perfect
so I highly recommend picking this piece
out even if you don't get the pants in a
shirt to match the shirt def is gonna go
with pencil skirts jeans or whatever and
these pants can definitely go with the
red top white top you can just kind of
elaborate and you don't even have to get
the same top I thought the top was cute
because the sleeves were kind of puffy
and then the pants leg was wide it just
gave him more of like a nice kind of
like mix you know what I mean I was like
a mix and I just I was like feeling it I
thought this outfit was excellent guys
so there's always time for the good and
the bad so there are two items from this
web set that just did not work at all
for me and one of the items well both of
them do not fit so I'm just gonna show
you guys what they look like just
because it was just terrible now I wish
that they specified on the website when
it comes to the shoes about like calf
sizes so I picked them over the knee
heel boots and this entire outfit was an
outfit I was supposed to put on together
I had the whole idea together as an
outfit so it's ironic how this entire
outfit enough they at all
so the boots I wish they specified that
the boots were Wildcat or like big cat
friendly or etc et-cetera
it'll be nice that they added that into
the description bar just to help people
out because you don't want to go on the
website and pick something out and think
that it's gonna fit and it doesn't these
boots did not fit at all and I'm
probably just even though I got these
products sent to me for review I'm just
gonna send them back because I can't
utilize this or if I do another giveaway
somebody else who doesn't have white
cabs like me can utilize these goods now
I love the over the me do boot concept
and when I saw it on the website I said
to myself okay these may fit now
definitely has one of those nice kind of
chunky heels it's not really small
it definitely dips really nice into a
nice pony look which I thought was
really cute which is why I liked it the
reason why I thought they wouldn't fit
it was because the back of this is open
so I thought it was kind of like a wide
calves it's really not even white like
it would fit over my knees but this is
where the issue came in with these it's
tight right here why would you make the
boot tight here this is like the worst
spot to make the boot tighter and let's
put the stretch in this area right here
they didn't do that so this the boot
itself is just too damn tight so that
thing just ticked me off cuz I'm like
well I put my foot in I'm like okay I
got it in let me just we'll go down a
little bit no it doesn't fit so it's
just like one of those things it's just
like I wish they would have just put in
the description wide calf friendly or
not you know just something that
specifies that it's gonna work you know
I'm saying cuz usually when I shop for
boots and stuff like that like I usually
shop on public desire public desire has
those types of materials that are gonna
stretch and if you watch a recent like
also kind of like a while back now that
I posted a video and I did a review on
public desire and I showed exactly why
their boots fit you can see in the sole
area how you know they're gonna stretch
for some reason I mistake these and
these were just up failed a fail so I'm
either have to give us away to somebody
or just send them back to the company
now the next dress I thought this just
askew maybe I was too ball bold bold
bold bold picking the socks that I just
won an extra-large this dress did not
fit
oh when I mean short I mean short and
I'm I was not gonna come out here and do
that uh uh it's a cute dress guys but it
was absolutely too short
I wish artists sized up till 1x in this
so maybe the 1x would've gave me the
length that I needed but then when I
looked at the dress I'm like it's
actually pretty cheap looking to the
material the dress is almost a linty
material which I just don't understand
how is it linty already I only tried it
on one tonight
you know I'd even try it on yeah I did
try it on I tried on one time why is it
so linting like come on so the dress is
already linty and it does have like a
little slip on the bottom of the dress
now the issue with the slip is when
you're trying to put this on if you
don't put it on the right way you're
gonna look like roly-poly pun g1g like
it's just not gonna work so the whole
concept of this is just this was
terrible to me a little spaghetti chef
there's no structure with a boob areas
that there's not a dip it just goes
straight across like this all if you
don't I would recommend wearing this
with a long-sleeve shirt or something
like that i don't recommend just wearing
like that just because it's gonna look
stupid but I just it just did nothing so
I couldn't even give you guys my my
honest opinion like like full off it
thing talked through or show you guys
that at all because it just didn't work
and this outfit was supposed to be in
combination with the boots of the
long-sleeve shirt and I just had this in
vision in my head but like everything
works it didn't work it just failed
failed failed failed so this didn't work
guys and like I said I'm not gonna come
on your idea it wasn't good so yeah
pretty much
