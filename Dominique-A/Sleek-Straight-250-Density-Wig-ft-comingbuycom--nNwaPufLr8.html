to wit Wednesday so today's video is
going to be a wig box to you guys by
coming guys calm now I've seen other
reviews on YouTube from this company so
I decided to review it as well so I
would sent a 24 inch straight yaki here
textured wig now this is a very nice
unit guys the only thing that's
different about this unit that is not
comparable to a lot of places is that
this unit is 250 percent density so it
is thicker now this is what the unit
looks like guys it's a straight unit
long and pretty the ends are cut all
straight which I like so you kind of
have some unbalanced with this one it is
a natural color so you're not getting
any like pre dye Dupree process look to
this one so if you want to dye this unit
you are free to Dittus to any color that
you want it does have three columns at
the top one at the base and two exercise
right here I also have a comb in the
back with adjustable straps as use it is
about four inches of parting space guys
which is really nice and it does come
with baby here around the perimeter the
baby hairs are kind of long around the
perimeter so I'll probably go in and cut
these a little bit and shape them up so
that when I do decide to glue it down
that it looks natural so I'm going to
cut the lace off put this unit on and
show you guys that it looks like if
you're interested in seeing what this
unit looks like today I want you to stay
tuned keep on lunch
so I basically put the wig on I ended up
having to strain it out because there
was some kind of ridges and kind of like
lumps and bumps in it so I went in and
use my flat iron to strain it out
I always say this in my reviews from
wigs and like I feel like I'm repeating
myself like a broken record but
I'm going to say this now again probably
because I said it maybe like for the
last few rig reviews but this wig is
every single thing like if you're
someone who's looking for some straight
sleek hair that is a really good density
that is a perfect route to length maybe
even 26 I'm starting to calculate it as
and here that doesn't tangle add very
minimal shedding and it's just like come
on this wig is a plus plus this is the
first time I've ever do to wind up with
250 density and I feel like this wig
just hits the nail on the head this one
just so nice guys it is so sleek after I
strand it's like sleek and it's a
perfect way to do like a middle part in
because there's so much parting space on
here you can do like two quarrels this
way you can select your cute little
French braid going across it's just this
is so nice guys and the density is
perfect the length is long guys it's
about 20 it says 24 inches but I started
to pick a 26 inch wig but it's true to
length and it's not those types of units
that are really thin at the end
I hate units like that where it's kind
of like long and then when it gets to
the tippity tivity of the end it's like
really really thin this one is perfect
guys and I know I always say this in all
my reviews but this is a sleigh
full wig this is like really really nice
one thing I would say is that my husband
tiny so I probably have to add an
elastic band on it just to keep a little
bit snug but I did use adjustable straps
on it to give it to make a little bit
more tighter you can go in and glue it
if you want to I definitely did not glue
this one down just because I'm leaving
tomorrow for vacay so I didn't want to
put this down because of other ways that
I'm wearing for vacay but it does have a
perfect hairline when I do come back
from my trip I will glue this down so I
could wear for a couple of days so I can
really you know fill it through but for
now first show-and-tell of this wig
a-plus-plus if you have not heard of
this company before and this is the
first time you're hanging about this
company make sure you go down below in
the description box and click the link
check out this wig website
I think these wigs are perfect for the
first trial this unit I am very very
pleased with this unit this is basically
to me so far and nine out of ten sizing
is a little bit funny so let's all give
it a 9 out of 10 shedding is very
minimal expressly because I cut the lace
off so I just receive like were two
strands from it if it does continue to
persist with shedding then I will come
back and tell you guys that but I highly
doubt that's going to happen because I
usually don't wear wigs like constantly
I switch them out a lot so I'm probably
not going to reach that problem it takes
Heat perfect I love how bones straight
it looks and I'm probably going to leave
this straight because I think because
it's so long it looks better when it's
straight if it was curls will be like
too much of a long pearl so I think it's
straight like this or the middle part is
so yes guys that pretty much it I'm
really happy if this wigs Wednesday's
are really like coming and I'm really
liking the products item review for you
guys and I hope you guys enjoy the
products I'm showing you guys make sure
