today with another wig review now this
wig review is on the free dress equal
wig and this is the luxurious integrated
lace front wigs and basically what that
means is this one has a long part this
is the lace deep invisible L part wig
I've done away from this brand before
which was identity way so this one is
similar to that with being the fact that
they do have a larger part a longer part
in a wider part so that you don't really
have to do that much if I add some
powder to it so the style that I got is
style karissa and i got in the color 1b
so this is an info card that it comes
with it just basically describes the
model 'near has a really nice colored
one I think this one that she has on as
the op4 30 I tried to get that one but
they didn't have it in stock so I had
opted for the one big just to be safe
but I'm really excited with about this
unit it's like a Tamiya called the
Beyonce unit because it's like really
really wavy and pretty so I'm really
excited about this one
the Danny D wig was shiny and this one
is shiny as well too synthetic wigs are
always going to be shiny guys but this
one has really nice curls and it's very
long and pretty so it's kind of like one
of those wigs that if you're really
trying to like take it up a notch with
your like look or whatever that you're
wearing this will look really nice and
the curls the hair is very soft guys it
does have three columns but for some
reason these companies are freaking
weird why the hell would you put a comb
two little combs right where the parting
space is that I just don't get that
I'm not going to utilize these to be
honest with you the only comb that I
usually utilizes the back comb and the
adjustable straps I do like my combs on
the ear tabs but I don't know they just
be doing some weird so the combs
are actually at the beginning of this
unit which is freaking weird so yeah so
on what I'm going to do is I'm going to
cut the lace off I'm going to put it on
and try to see how it and manipulate it
a little bit to make it look cool and
yeah so tell me what you guys think with
this video make sure you thumbs it up
and always like thumbs up like comment
subscribe if you're interested in
knowing what kind of hair this is that I
have this unit that I have on my head
right here just leave your comments down
below regarding this pink hair that I'm
rocking and I actually was afraid to
wear this because I thought it was
really
arrey but muscular like really kind of
like okay girls stop but I think it
looks really good
think of the makeup itself kind of made
it look a little bit better the light
beat that I have on might be so um yeah
so if you want to know how I got this
color and this look just leave your
comments down below for this so stay

okay guys so this is what the unit looks
like and I'm going to say this right now
this unit is so so so so so nice like I
really really like this unit guys like
umm the one thing I haven't wore bangs
like this in a long time and this is not
it's kind of like layered look so I kind
of made it into like one of those
sweepings like um oh my god this looks
so freakin good like this looks like so
real um so when I added on my hair it
was the technique art wild style er this
is the next day here so this is a dry
finishing spray so basically what it
does this is from L'Oreal so um I got
this from we're taking this room I got
this for about like 16 dollars at Ulta
so this basically gives you that kind of
like a dry shampoo or ashy look it gives
you like kind of like more more stuff
like that little of a drier tinge look
instead of having that really shiny look
so I just sprayed it around my bangs and
I sprayed it around the hair itself and
I did use a wide tooth comb to kind of
detangle the hair a little bit towards
the back I have not received any
shedding from the hair yet guys this
hair is so sucked like look out look at
the part guys that look so flawless
right there like an all I do is add
powder like why like all these like I
swear like these like these weight
companies have been coming on point like
this looks so freakin good like this
looks like really really fabulous and
it's like a really long unit so I
probably just wear like this guys I know
I was this seems like I always do the
tuck behind the ear thing and then kind
of but this is different cuz this one
has like kind of like one of those sexy
bangs so you really could salt like this
is really sultry and you can really like
sexify this look up a lot so I um I god
I cannot like what the ahh like this is
it guys like I really like this house
whoa I might have to give me another one
of these like I'm gonna have to get that
color that the girl has on the actual
car info card like this is so freakin
pretty like what this is synthetic this
was like own like like maybe like less
than 30 Isles or maybe like 35 dollars
or whatever it is but this is so nice
guys like I'm in love like I'm in love
like you cannot let come on like like
why like wait
like this is like so cute that granted
you can go in and do what you want with
the part but I'm going to leave mines
like that I do see the up top here it's
a little bit like a bum I get kind of
like a little bit of like a little hill
up here maybe I'm exaggerating but all
you got to do is basically just is just
a wig on or put like bobby pins in it -
kind of like force the weight to stay
down but come on guys like let's let's
go like it's like so it's like kind of
like one of those sex you like
