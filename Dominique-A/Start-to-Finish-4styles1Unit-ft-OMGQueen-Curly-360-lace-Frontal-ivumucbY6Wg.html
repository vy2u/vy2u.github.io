Padma yeah yeah what video what video
yeah it's a bad man in there what tell
me when spit on that mean we are looking
click on up what stuff do you want like
I think I require this video like three
thousand times already and out of
frustration I think are finally done
alright guys so I'm back today with
another wig review now this is a custom
unit that I created by my lonesome now
this hair was said to me from a company
called oMG Queen hair calm I've seen
reviews from this from other people on
YouTube for this company and it seems
pretty popular should so I would send a
16 inch frontal and I would sent two
bundles of hair at 16 and 18 inch I got
the virgin brazilian natural curly hair
and it is so pretty
so the wig company was nice enough to
send me some items as well they send me
3-way clips they sent me two needles and
a thread they also sent me a wig cap in
an elastic band but I often to use my
own wig cap just because the wig cap
that I use is thebomb.com and I will
post it up here for you guys so you guys
can see so I use my own wig cap and I
did use the other stuff to achieve the
wig that I created I usually get when I
do way they usually put two wig cones at
the front right on the sides but for
this one I just did it because when are
you to 360 sometimes when you put the
wig combs right here it kind of looks
like a little bit a little hump right
here so I just decided not to I am going
to put this on for you guys and use the
got to be blue method to kind of glue it
down and I do I did put a comb in the
back so I be I now I just saw this on
and I did it it took me a while like an
hour to make this unit wasn't nothing
crazy I use all the bundles and I use
the whole entire frontal I mean you got
to use a whole front oh boy so I did use
both of the bundles and the frontal to
achieve this look I'm really excited
about this way because the
oh pattern is beautiful guys so this is
what the inside of the cap looks like I
didn't put the cones at the top here I
do have an elastic band here
I did sew down one comb in the back and
it does come with its own adjustable
strap on the 360 already which was
really cool now I did use all the
bundles guys and this is how big the
hair is like this is some big hair and
this is only two bundles in a frontal
like bitch well so it's really really
full I'm going to try to see what it
looks like down and then I'm going to do
the high bun wig because I really
specifically want this to be one of my
high bun wigs I just think it's like
really cute and like a nice curl pattern
I might even do it up to half up and
then half down because I love the curl
pattern but we'll see but I'm going to
call this my high bun wig because I
specifically will only wear this in high
bun as you go for longer inches of curly
hair so this is kind of like a step down
for me not just open but yeah so if you
guys want to see what this unit looks
like I wanted to say to people I don't
know

why uncle you gonna be private close the

like I honestly and truly loved this
hair if you are here a curly hair
fanatic and you just really like some
good curly hair this curly hair is oh my
god it's so beautiful I just love
everything about it
the curl pattern is like perfect it's
precise like where you going to get a
curly pattern that matches but the
frontal matches the curly hair and it
like most of the times me ordering here
from certain companies the bundles never
really match the closure this one
matches so perfect and it is so so cute
usually I tend to go for those longer
lengths and I thought nobody knows going
to make this kind of like a ponytail wig
but that like I'm going to wear
this down like this I think that this is
so cute and because it's not so long it
kind of pulls off looking a little bit
more natural
obviously the got to be booze on messy
around my edges but you just have to go
on with some water and clean it up a
little bit but I think it looks natural
it lays down pretty good I usually have
taupe with the air ties with the air top
kind of stayed down this time so that's
the plus for that but overall like guys
this is and it's not long at all guys
let me show you guys the length it's
just right there right above the boobs
like this is I got like what the app
like this is so nice like oMG Queen here
