video goes any further I'm gonna stop
this part through just because some of
you guys don't understand what I'm doing
so what I'm doing right now is the
stocking cap method this unit they did
bleach the knots well for some reason I
just don't
I think they over bleached it not so I
need to cover up as much space as I can
with my color stocking cap so basically
what I'm using is a yellow got to be
glue along with my Aussie instant freeze
hairspray now I ran out of the got to be
glue of freezing blast spray whatever so
I'm gonna use this to hold the stocking
cap down I'm gonna run the blow dryer to
it for about five minutes and then
reapply another layer and then cut the
edges off now I do have a video on this
guy so I'll link it up here for you guys
but in order for me to get this way
correct I'm gonna have to screw this
down stocking cap method and then slay
the hell out of this so guys if you want
to see how it ends up looking stay tuned
and keep online
alright guys so I'm back so I basically
beat my face up and what I'm gonna do
now guys is I'm going to tweeze this way
now as you guys can see the hairline the
hairline you can see where they kind of
bleach it and I don't think the bleach
table is that good so it's a little bit
too light and then some parts that came
out over bleach it a little bit so I'm
going to take the baby hairs out and you
guys always ask me how to get the baby
hair so thin
so what I'm gonna do is show you guys
how much baby here I take out of this so
that you guys can see and don't take a
lot because I don't like a lot so I'm
only gonna take like a little bit like
just enough baby here to cover up any
errors so I'll just take this much baby
here out the front and what I'm gonna do
is actually tweeze this guys because I
need to see more scalp is right here
it's not there's not enough scalp egde
in that area so that's what I need to do
so I'm just gonna pull like this much
out right here and then what I'm going
to do is I'm gonna go in and I'm going
to tweeze the front up now the front
when I say tweeze guys I'm going to use
my tweezers and kind of really get in
there and pull the hairs out so I don't
have a method to this I just do it and
just see what it looks like after I get
as much hair as I can out I even go as
far as the back to kind of tweeze more
out of the back because I just don't
want it to be too bulky in the front
I'm gonna go in with my scissors and
just cut the baby hairs a little bit
like I said I didn't do like huge baby
here I did thin baby here so I'm just
gonna cut like a little bit and
sometimes I cut mine as long sometimes I
cut mine short I'm gonna go a little
short this time just because I don't
want it to be a distraction for the
hairstyle now this wig was already pre
parted guys so I'm gonna leave the part
the way it was and just jazz it up a
little bit just because I feel like with
the lace that's on this way then and
give you like a whole bunch of lace so I
don't want to overdo it a little bit
with the with the parting so I'm just
gonna leave it the way it came and I'm
just going to jazz the hair up guys so
I'm just kind of the baby hairs around
the perimeter like I said I do really
light baby is because I don't want it to
look unnatural so I'm just gonna I'm
doing light baby hairs and then
obviously I cut the little side tab part
right here really kind of seemingly
short so that I get that kind of look if
you know what I mean but I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna wear this hair just like down
so now you guys can see where I kind of
tweeze it at so this is a tweeze line
now but you guys see what I'm talking
about when it comes to the bleaching
part it's a little too light like it
looks a little bit too much it looks
like they bleached it too much so what
I'm gonna do is get my powder and I'm
gonna put the powder on this bad boy oh
did I forget some hair yes I did so I'm
gonna get a little bit of powder and I'm
gonna apply some powder on and then I'm
gonna I don't even need to clean the
edges up this time because it's really
not that messy and I use the yellow got
to be glue guys so it's not that messy
just this part needs to be cleaning up
right here so I'm gonna go get my powder
get my brush do my baby hairs and I'll
be right back guys so I got my handy
dandy toothbrush like I just get a
regular toothbrush and I just make it
into my baby hair brush and this one is
dingy so I'm probably on it's about a
new one so I'm gonna use the got to be
glue yellow
you guys always ask me so I'm using the
yellow one cuz I can't find my mini
black one I usually like the black one
when it comes to styling the sides and
stuff like that just because it isn't
it's not too flaky I feel like
yellow one is flakier and but the yellow
one definitely adheres better people
have been asking me to do reviews on
tape wig tape gorillas snot and I don't
know what the other ones are but can you
link them down below for me so I can
start getting those videos in formation
I'm gonna do another start to finish
with a different type of glue and slay
it too and do like a full style I'm
thinking about doing more cutting in my
videos so like cutting the hair I've
been trying to practice lately on
cutting bobs and stuff like that doing
like bowl cuts and things like that and
I tested one up last night and it came
out good so if you guys want me to do
another video when I do like start to
finish talk through and then even style
the hair color the air and then snow you
guys the ending result I can do that I
actually enjoyed doing those videos guys
because when the hair comes out at the
end it's just like perfect I am so happy
so I definitely have a custom wig that
I'm gonna create and I'm gonna color it
and all that kind of stuff so I'm gonna
put that video up and I hope you guys
like it it's just gonna be so exciting
so let me just do this okay in my eyes
are creasing how is that possible if I
put a primer whatever so I'm just gonna
play at the baby here's I don't really
like need to do too much like I'm just
going to like grab a few twirl it a
little bit
one twirl sometimes I like to do like a
short tour on the front right here like
a little long twirl I just do it and
then what I'm gonna do if you guys watch
me enough I put my headscarf on for like
five minutes
like 95 minutes for like 20 minutes and
then go about my business and then I
come back and break the cast when I'm
saying break the cast when the got to be
glue sticks on your hair and it makes it
kind of hard it leaves like a hard
little look on it so I leave the look on
there for like 10 20 minutes and then
when I take the headscarf off I break
the cast so therefore it's not it's not
as hard looking gel like looking so I'll
leave the headscarf on for 20 minutes to
kind of build the style because if you
put the dr. B blue on in like this it'll
keep the pattern once you take the
headscarf on it'll break the pattern but
it'll still have that wave if you know
what I mean and if you you know what I
mean so I'm just going to gel these down
a little bit to give me some little
swivels and stuff like that
I'll leave the sides of one normally
touch those too much
because it's just doing too much when
you do all that stuff so I'm going to I
think that's good enough right this this
one might be a little bit too long so
I'm going to let's see yeah I think
that's fine okay
so that's good so I'm gonna put the
headscarf on now guys and leave it for
like 20 minutes I'm gonna take it off
break the cast put the powder on and
then style this unit on camera for you
guys I'm gonna do a cute little style
with it the hombre de hombre the
highlights on this wig are a freakin one
guys I cannot wait for the finish
alright guys so I took the head scarf
off and this is like I said you'll see
how hard the got to be glue is so I'm
just gonna take my comb and I'm just
gonna flake it off and you know how
flaky got to be glue is so I'm gonna
flake it off a little bit like some of
them I will on some of them I won't like
this one I will okay just so I can have
more of like not that kind of like two
perfectly gelled look so I just kind of
moved them a little bit so that they're
not so perfect alright and this one
seems a little crusty but we're gonna do
is put some argan oil on it so I'm gonna
get some argan oil
alright so I just kind of displaced them
a little bit so they're not so stiff
because when it's stiff it just doesn't
look good and you can see that this one
is flaky so I'm gonna put argon oil on
it just to mask the flakiness so what
I'm gonna do now guys is I'm going to
use my BH Cosmetics contour palette so
this is yeah BH Cosmetics contour
palette I believe this is the number two
which is the darkest one if you're gonna
get this one just get the darkest one I
already told you guys do not go and buy
this you can just use any type of face
powder my regular foundation face powder
is the Maybelline fit me so I use this
one I would just say you can use that
but I already have this so I just used
it for my wigs but it's obviously almost
ready for it's like death like it's
almost done and I thought so many of
these already so I'm gonna use this one
right here and this one mixed together
there's not a method to it just kind of
like go for it so I'm gonna mix those
two together and I'm gonna apply it in
the spots that are that need to be you
know
have colored basically and see that's
already too light so I'm just gonna go
in a darker shade you just have to play
around with them when you're doing it
because it's not always going to come
out SuperDuper perfect so I'm just going
to play around with it to get my color
so yeah so I'm gonna try to use some of
the darker colors to just to kind of
really bring it in and I know sometimes
people like oh are you putting the
powder on your hand hair powder on here
not doesn't even matter I try not to get
on the hair as much but I really try to
get it into the parting space so to make
it look a little bit more realistic
because when you get into the hair I
mean it's not it's really not helping so
yeah and this is see the color that I'm
applying on my head is blending with me
and not so much of this kind of it's
like weird I don't know on camera I'm
not using a filter I've tried I said
this before my video magazine filter on
this camera this is just the way it is
ever since I got the camera I have not
fixed it so I don't know where these
insinuations are coming where people are
insisting that I'm doing then I don't
make up so so it looks like it's a
good job with the bleach what I'm
telling you guys straight from what I
can see and the bleach job was it looks
a little too much for me and maybe it's
because I don't have experience
bleaching here so maybe I'm just not
used to seeing bleach not so maybe
that's what it is I'm not gonna say that
I'm not gonna say that you guys done
what you guys saying do you guys think
it looks pretty good so umm yeah so I
basically apply the powder everywhere
you guys can see how natural that looks
now you really want to make sure you get
that ear tap cuz the ear time for me is
like a nightmare but for some reason I
was able to get them my ear tabs this
time around the ear times actually
landed pretty good so I would say on a
scale of 1 to 10 this way fits at like a
10 it did come with adjustable strap as
you guys saw in the beginning so it's
pretty simple to put this on so yeah so
that's the powder job guys wow wow wow
wow that looks good Wow Wow oh my god no
I'm not even joking bro yeah that looks
pretty good so I'm gonna get my curling
wand we're gonna stop imma fast-forward
it and then I'll come back to you guys
with the ending result
alright guys so I'm back and it's
actually day five since I'm coming back
to review this for you guys so I wanted
to kind of wear the wig for a few days
before I came and give you guys like a
definitive review so I am trying
something new on my channel so I hope
you guys appreciate this and kind of go
with this one
so this units from here Vivi calm guys
so it's they're kind of like highlighted
Bob lob style unit now I did glue this
one down with the got to be glue method
and I kind of do like a little
step-by-step so you guys can hear
everything and this is the finish start
to finish so this is the finish so you
guys know exactly how I feel now as far
as the dr.p glue guys I googles down on
I believe it was let's see I believe I
glue this down on a Friday so today is
Tuesday when I'm recording this and you
guys will see this week Wednesday so
this is Tuesday so now that I'm sure so
that's about five days and it's just now
lifting with the dr. B glue so I use the
yellow got to be goo guys that's the one
I always use when I'm gluing my units
down and it lasts about four or five
days I do have some lifting on the sides
right here and I can actually snatch it
off if I want to but I don't want to
hurt myself so I'm not going to so as
far as glueing goes 45 days will get you
a good hold I didn't take this off so
obviously it stayed on my head I just
use my headscarf decide down the top of
the front and that was that now as far
as styling guys you guys saw me do curl
one set on this baby on Friday so I
didn't bring my curl one when I was away
this weekend my curling one when I was
away this weekend so the curl wants that
lasted
I actually just before I came record
this just refreshes it a little bit so
this is what it looks like I'm gonna be
completely honest with you guys the
entire weekend when I was wearing this
hair it was absolutely fabulous like I
had no issues with it whatsoever I
didn't bring any styling products with
it no oils or anything like that because
it didn't need it I'm glad to say that
this hair definitely has a life of its
own
so I kind of felt like when I was
styling in a certain way would try to do
something different I mean I'm like yo
stay still like what are you doing so I
definitely felt like I was trying to do
other stuff when I didn't wanted to do
other stuff so that was a little
annoying I did have a lot of trouble
with the front with the actual wig
itself this is a lace front wig
if I didn't mention in the beginning
it's a lace-front so you only get a
little bit of lace in the front about
two inches on the sides and three right
down the middle when they kind of do it
like that they don't extend the sides
out which is kind of weird but if you
know what I mean leave your comment down
below so with this one guys they
bleached it and I just do not like it I
just like the bleaching process guys I
kind of feel like if you're a company
and you don't have like the skills to
the scale skills to bleach just let the
consumer just let the buyer do it like
I'm even know how to bleach guys but I
know when something's not bleach all the
way right I just honestly feel like this
is way I even putting powder on it I had
a difficult time like in the beginning
when I recorded the video it looked it
looked good but I don't know I kept like
this entire week I kept looking at
myself like God don't be one of those
people walking around with legs
something kind of funny don't be that
girl so I just have like this nervous
thing about me I just kept looking like
though something's not right about this
so I definitely feel like it's been a
little bit over processed you guys can
let me know I'm not sure like I said I'm
not like the super magic genius when it
comes to bleaching I've never featured a
bleached wig on my channel I've never
done a video on it so this is my first
time but I just feel like the bleaching
process on this one just did not take
off like a rocket ship it just didn't go
um so like I said I would prefer if the
companies just not bleached it for me
let me do my own job let me figure it
out by myself or let me just rock with
the things I know and the things I'm
comfortable with so bleaching process
for this one is enough for me I would
say if I purchase this week tell them
not to even put the bleach on it just do
it by yourself other than that guys I do
like the color the color is very very
fun one thing I would point out to you
guys it's kind of weird because the root
of the hair is dark and then it comes
down into this like chocolate brown
ombre it almost threw me off a little
bit guys just because it's supposed to
be a highlight of week why are we doing
ombre and highlight together it's like
balayage mix but the bottom color
doesn't match the highlight color so why
to do that I don't know but when you
style it up then you put the earrings on
make a popping it just all comes in so
nice so it's kind of like how can you
not like it so they did do a lot of
highlights emphasized in the front area
right here there is a little bit of a
highlight right here but it's like at
the weirdest spot which is like right
here
and that guy said that whole arm break
chocalate like the number six color just
kind of throws me off so I just kind of
tucked this smart back behind my ear but
just to see how nice curl wants that was
done on this side I never could really
get the tip of the hair to actually stay
because I'm always trying to flatten it
out but I did use my Aussie instant my
aunt's Aussie instant freeze hairspray
just to kind of touch it up a little bit
to keep it refine what you guys can see
there's highlights in some sections back
here as well too but like I said I feel
like most of the highlight emphases was
towards the front and yeah but I do like
this overall guys if it's a wig that I'm
not even like check the price to be
honest with you guys but if it's listed
like over 300 over $250 I kind of feel
like they're just extending too much cuz
you didn't need the bleach knocks you
didn't need all that I think the color
job is great I think they did a really
good job at the color it's very natural
like I said I just wish that there was
more coloring on this to kind of give it
more of a more of a like cool fun look
it's just not enough color in the front
like around it the color on the front
kind of reminds me of a custom wig I
made so it's kind of like I could have
do this by myself but I do like it the
length is perfect guys and you guys know
I always curl and then strain at the end
because I like that kind of fun choppy
luck but yeah but other than that the
hairline for me I just don't like the
bleach area I don't feel like it was
done well but you guys can let me know
down below if you guys think it was done
well I'm not really good at stuff like
that so I don't know that part so you
know that much but this is a Learning
Channel soil I had to come and do my
best so guys I will leave all the
