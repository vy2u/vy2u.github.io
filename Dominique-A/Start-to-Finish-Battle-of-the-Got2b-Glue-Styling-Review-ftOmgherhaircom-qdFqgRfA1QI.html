recently I've been doing kind of like
mix-matched videos like mix mash videos
I've been doing a lot of mix videos for
you guys I'm trying to do different
stuff in 2018 so I hope you guys are
enjoying the videos so today's video I'm
gonna show you guys basically the Battle
of the got to be glue so you guys
haven't given me a lot of suggestions
from my last video when I showed you
guys this step-by-step stocking cap
method and you guys loved that I got so
much positive feedback from that video
so I'm gonna continue trying to do
reviews and like learning videos as well
so it's not just gonna be me putting the
wig on I'm kind of gonna try to start
talking to you guys why put the unit's
down because everyone always asked me
how natural to ask me how I get my wig
so natural so why not do like little
lessons in reviews all at once so do
expect the videos to be a little bit
longer but I'm not gonna do like a 20
minute long video I think that video I
did was like 60 minutes long and you
guys took it pretty well so I hope that
you guys like this one today too so
basically what I'm gonna do today is
gonna show you guys a comparison of both
of the doxy the glues you guys give me
some great feedback about the black one
and I told you guys that I wasn't trying
to spend my coins on a black when
singing that I still had the yellow one
and it's a pretty good bottle I have
like a lot left in this one so I did go
to the hair store and I found a mini
bottle so I got the mini got got to be
glue in black and I had the regular
yellow one so what I'm going to do guys
is I'm going to put the yellow one on
the right side of my head and then the
black one on the left side and I'm gonna
see which one I like better now I almost
feel almost feel like if I mix both of
them together I'll probably get like the
ultimate type of glue adhesive whatever
but I'm going to show you guys
separately what they look like just so
that you guys can kind of get a gist
though yellow one definitely is a little
bit crusty and you guys have mentioned
that in my video and I know that too so
what I used to do to counteract that is
use a little bit argan oil and add the
powder on to kind of disguise the
crustiness now I am hearing that the
black one doesn't have flakes it's not
crusty so I'm trying to make sure that
it's not but one thing I did hear is
that the black one doesn't hold as well
as a yellow one now the yellow one holds
very very good so you win if you guys
watched my videos all you guys are
support me a lot when I show you guys my
reviews and I
trying to pull the weight back the wig
is not coming off and usually when I eat
when I do my glue down methods is on my
units and lasts about four days four to
five days I probably have to go back
after the fifth day and kind of like
just kind of touch up some areas but you
have to think about if you wear makeup
and stuff like that you're like washing
your face frequently and stuff like that
that water rubbing and gets the gossipy
glue is definitely to pull some of the
glue off so you got to keep that in mind
so I'm definitely going to see which one
works I hope you guys enjoy this I did
do the stocking cap method again but I
just used a free freezing spray that got
to be the freezing spray to kind of hold
it down so it's already done the caps
already down so all I'm gonna do is
slide this bad boy back and start gluing
away so if you're interested in seeing
how this turns out and which glue is
better I would like you to stay tuned
and keep up so the first thing I'm going
to do is apply the got to be glue so on
the right side of my head I'm gonna do
the yellow and I'm gonna start with the
yellow first so you guys know the yellow
one this is the one that I kind of have
a lot of the crusty troubles with and
everyone says the same thing about this
one but guys this one holds very well
like I said I didn't use the new one yes
I don't know but I'm kind of looking for
suggestions from people and people have
told me different things about them so
I'm kind of you know taking in what
everyone's saying and kind of making my
own judgement so this will be the final
moment when I make my final judgement on
this one so I'm really excited to see
how this turns out so basically what I'm
gonna do is just glue this side down I'm
gonna let this dry I try to do two
layers and I'm trying not to do like a
heavy Chucky's layer because when you do
a kind of heavy it just turns into a
mess so I do two layers I don't know if
I mentioned that my last video I do two
layers just because I feel like two
layers works better so I'm doing half
and half so I'm gonna do the black one
one thing I don't I lost the cap the
black one too like an idea so one thing
I notice about the black one though it
dries clear though yellow one definitely
is really casseon way and I kind of feel
like that's another reason why sometimes
when I do my wig reviews it's a little
bit caste and white because the yellow
one is like caste and white but like I
said if you watched my recent was my
recent and yeah it was my recent video
now and set it up here somewhere
I showed you guys basically in that
video that when you add powder to the
areas that are crusty that thing like
disappears in a heartbeat so you really
don't like need to use the black one you
can actually manipulate but if you're
someone that doesn't have all the time
to begin on it you can with your units
but anybody that watches my channel I
know you guys like whit crazy so I know
you guys would take your time and try to
perfect a unit especially when you watch
this to be like Slade to the gods
so um I would say if I did use a yellow
one I would just put a little bit of
argan oil on the area that's white and
just go over with some face powder you
guys ask me all the time of face powder
I use and I try to tell you guys every
single time I use the BH Cosmetics
contour palette it's the powder palette
and I just kind of like go through the
colors and like mix it around I go for
the dark on and like a little bit of a
light color into it just to make a nice
skin scalp look obviously when I
initially put it on when I don't got my
foundation on or whatever whatever it's
a little bit like kind of light but all
you have to do is go in and tap a little
bit of that dark powder in it and you're
good people are always gonna have
something to say but once I mean like
once I show you guys two before an app
so you guys are kind of like girl you
did that so hopefully that this one
turns out like that it would be great if
it does so I'm just gonna let this air
dry I usually use a blow dryer with the
freezing spray but I'm not doing that
today I got time on my hands right now
right now guys you guys won't even
believe what time it is it is oh snap is
it what if it did 150 nice so I'm gonna
use a freezing spray just to hit one
coat or the freezer the blast yo this
thing is really cold you up top up
freeze it oh it's really cold oh and I'm
stop you guys can hear my heat on it
just came on like it's so random like
you said it you'll set the the heat on
the thermostat and then I was just kind
of like shoot on myself I think I just
got this thing in my eye hopefully not
oh it's a little spicy
I'll survive so I'm gonna just let this
dry a little bit like you can already
see that the yellow side is kind of
drying a little bit oops out a little
bit here so the yellow Sun is kind of
drying a little bit but you can see the
white Caston area this side is drying
too but obviously I just put that stuff
on it so it's gonna be a little bit
sticky
so you can also go in and just add some
on top of the lace I actually like that
lace I actually like adding some of it
on top of the cap when you do the
stocking cap method just because if if
your if your corners rise a little bit
the whole tight unit will rise so you'll
still have something that's sticking on
top like right in the middle and it kind
of makes it hair blend a little bit
better it makes it look a little bit
better so I think I Drive pretty much
enough I don't have to try sixty Seconds
to dry I don't I don't know but even if
I don't drive fully the first time I'm
gonna drive fully the last time so I'm
just gonna add another light layer to
this side and this is the yellow side so
remember this is a yellow side so I'm
gonna add another light layer and I kind
of Pro apply it kind of chunky in the
beginning but I'm gonna spread it out
guys so don't worry so like I said you
can go ahead and add some of it on top
of the lace part for some reason this
one doesn't have like a long sideburn or
like yeah side side tab so this woman
lay it perfectly where I have a glue at
which I love I hate the wigs that come
with those long side tabs those are the
hardest tabs to put down and some
companies I've noticed recently they've
been giving you like the shorter side
tabs so therefore when you put it down
it lands perfectly now I can really mess
with a company that does that some
companies that do it with like the thick
ones the long ones it's just unrealistic
sometimes and I even showed in one video
that I had to cut mines just because I
was like it's just not gonna work that
way so I'm gonna do like another thin
layer guys and it looks like I'm making
a chunky layer but I'm spreading it out
with my fingers so that it lands in all
directions so that sometimes when you
make a mistake
and the wig is not lit like the wig
doesn't land on the spot that glue is at
I like to spread it around a little bit
and then what if it's still there after
when you're trying to do your baby hairs
it'll kind of adhere to the baby here so
you have some it'll it'll work so I'm
just gonna blend this out right here so
that it sticks and I'm studying like
crazy in this video this is so
embarrassing
alright guys so I'm gonna go hit the
blow dryer and I not be right back
alright guys so at this point it's
pretty much dry you still get a little
bit of that whiteness in this area which
is like I said and you know what when
you touch it it kind of Blanche's it a
little bit so I would say don't touch it
what I'm gonna do is just slide the way
down and proceed on to getting missile a
so I try to match up the air taps I did
not put the combs in just because it's
unnecessary right now so I'm going to
slide this in place I start from the
front there we go
and what's really sticky Wow wow it's
really sticky so um oh wow it's really
sticky I'm gonna that kind of thing is
kind of giving it look makes me look
like I have like a freakin face lip on
the side right here so I'm gonna just
put this down since other side is
complete
and these spill this see what I'm saying
about the ear tabs the ear tabs lay so
perfect guys that you like look at how
perfect this ear tab lays and it's like
a small ear tab very looking look at
that so yeah so that's practically done
something just gonna use a comb and I
try to say this in the beginning I did
another review a little while ago when
you use the comb it actually makes the
wig stick down better the oils from your
hair definitely mess with the got to be
glue so I sometimes recommend just using
the back of a rat tail comb to kind of
curate or kind of push in the got to be
glue just because when you use your
fingers the oil will definitely kind of
move the glue itself so it looks like
I've got like a face lift right here or
something so what I'm gonna do is put my
headscarf down on it so that I can
actually really penetrate the glue it's
actually pretty tight pretty nice pretty
secure so I'm gonna put my headscarf
down I'll be back in ten minutes once
it's curated then I'll just start doing
the baby here and doing some heavy
tweezing to kind of bring this to life
alright guys so I basically did enough
tweezing I think I tweezed enough and as
much as I'm comfortable doing
I'm really scared when it comes to
tweeze just because it's kind of one of
those scary things so at this point I'm
just kind of wetting the baby ears a
little bit I'm gonna go with my eco
styler gel just to kind of like position
the baby ears I'm gonna let this cure it
overnight and then tomorrow I'm gonna
come in and try to show you guys how I
fix it the next day there's a little bit
of steps that I take to kind of achieve
the look just because this got to be
cool is definitely a messy got to be
glue now if you guys saw at the
beginning that yellow one was kind of
like white and caste and the black one
was clear but if you'll notice they are
both equally crusty
alright guys so it's basically day two
and at this point you guys can see that
both sides right and left yellow and
black both sides are crusty so I'm gonna
go on with some argon or I'm just gonna
put a little bit of argon oil dis is
soft and that's the gel material now I
do this because I'm not going to leave
that hard caste like flaky look I'm
going to actually deflate it what I'm
gonna do first is go ahead and add some
powder into the areas as you can see I
tweaks it quite enough if I want to I
could let me go back a little bit twice
or more but like I said I'm very scared
when it comes and stuff like that so I'm
gonna add some products Wendy's
cosmetics contour palette and it's a
powder palette and then just gonna
scatter some of the powder around and
just to kind of make it look more
realistic like I said you guys in the
beginning or if I say to DES towards the
end the powder definitely the butter and
the oil will definitely help minimize
that kind of like flakiness it hides it
a little bit so if you're not so much
really good at this adding some pyro and
we'll definitely cast we're gonna hide
that off white cats so I'm definitely
loose guys I think the look is comes out
pretty nice just keep watching cuz I'm
deputy to style you guys are gonna love
it
now this here's what I'm sporting guys
is from over here calm now this is their
Indian remedy humid here it is reflux
its yaki straight natural color 150
percent density and it's 20 inches long
now you guys know how I feel about my
yak two straight wigs this baby right
here is poppet
now what I'm gonna do with this will
guys it looks killing this little pulled
back style right here especially because
I'm slipping it down really nicely but
what I'm gonna do is actually do a nice
straight look with this one so I'm gonna
strain it out I think that this hairs
really nice guys it's inexpensive and
you guys know I will show you guys use
inexpensive wigs as well Portage's the
lace on the front and tuned into the
lace in the back
it's the perfect unit if you're like
someone who's simple that doesn't like
to do a lot of trouble with their hair
and it straightens nice it has a nice
texture and it almost mimics like
natural african-american hair which is a
plus
alright guys so this is what the hair
looks like final now basically what I
did was just show you guys that I
strained the hair out now this is some
really really nice here and if you guys
follow me you guys know I'm obsessed
with the Aki textured wigs yaki textured
wigs look so good now this isn't a super
yaki textured wig this is like a light
yaki and I just think it looks so nice
when I drew the strain and drew the
strainer
when I put this trainer through it it
just kind of like got straight
instantaneously and you guys can see how
pretty that texture is like this is
definitely my number one style my number
one wig to go for a wig texture to go
for now as far as the dots of glue guys
I kind of felt like the yellow one was
just as good as a black one now I know
you guys say that the black one the
yellow one is really flaking really
crusty honestly I showed you guys it's
the same thing no I actually said it
overnight so I wrapped my hair overnight
and I slept with my hair just to kind of
make sure that it was stuck down so
today I unravel then I'm looking at like
wait a minute
same crustiness you honestly couldn't
even tell which that I did so the right
side is a yellow side and the left side
is the black side know now that I lifted
and show you guys it looks pretty
realistic as far as the wig goes the wig
kind of came - for you girl so obviously
you guys saw that tweeze it did all that
kind of fun stuff to it like I usually
do for my units and I think it came out
really nice it's very very secure on
both sides and I'll pull both sides
where you got see now this is funny it's
secure but this one the black side to me
isn't as secure as a yellow side like
the yellow side is really firm but I
kind of feel like the black sides kind
of loosen up a little bit but as far as
security if you're looking for a tight
tight hold versus a light hold the
yellow one definitely does it for me now
like I said in the beginning of the
video guys I almost feel that if I kind
of mix both of the boosts together I
would get like the ultimate got to be
glue but if you want to do that you can
do that when you pull out the white the
yellow glue there's a little bit whiter
and pasty air versus the black one the
black one almost comes on as a clear
color so it kind of looks like a real
gel now I kind of feel like it's almost
it's kind of like a real gel like the
other one is definitely the other one is
definitely like a glue and the gel tech
mix so therefore it definitely gives you
that like guys like come on the yellow
side is not moving but I do feel like
the black side if I go a little too far
it'll just come the hell off so um I
probably have to go in and touch this
side up with the yellow but I'm gonna
stick with what I know and what I like I
honestly feel like the yellow glue for
me works better and like I said I use
argan oil and I use powder to disguise
the flakiness and I do use some water to
kind of tame it down one other thing
that I do use that it did not show you
this video is I use witch hazel
sometimes to get the crustiness off the
witch hazel or alcohol really pulls it
off fast so if you have witch hazel at
home try witch hazel it definitely helps
it out now I definitely like this guys I
think it came out really good as far as
the way the unit I will link all the
information down below if you're
interested in buying it it's definitely
inexpensive you guys know I like to
review inexpensive wigs and this here is
from oMG her hair calm alright guys so
don't forget to let me know what you
think about the glues in which one you
feel is better now do not forget guys to
thumbs up this video leave your comments

video with your friends and family
