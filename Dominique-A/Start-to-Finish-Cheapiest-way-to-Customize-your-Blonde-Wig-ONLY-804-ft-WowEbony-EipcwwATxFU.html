given here a little bit of different
color so I'm not gonna do all of them
just gonna scatter it around and try to
fill in spots but my major objective to
this one is to kind of get a little bit
of that 613 still in there after putting
this color on so we're not gonna fully
saturate our only booktube oxidize so
therefore I had enough enough but you
know rule to actually have a little bit
of highlights in it so I'm just gonna
saturate it and the muck and an
oversaturated just enough to get it you
know some different dimensions in this
die
so I'm just going to the middle part if
you want to you can actually go through
the sections and make your parts and add
the roots but I opted just to leave it
this way because I want the middle part
style permanent now this is very simple
guys I did this and I let this sit for
about like ten minutes it picked up the
dye very very fast there's no really in
trick to this guys I just think that you
should probably use the brush more just
because you want to be precise I only do
about like half an inch that even maybe
a quarter of an inch of dark roots that
it doesn't look too crazy would just
right
sprayed up just to hold the style by
definite length is covered so far it's
definitely going very well with my skin
and not clash too much and you guys can
see the party space look at the root
scars I did that look so perfect now as
far as the baby is go I did the baby is
out the front because I wanted it to the
wig to look like it was growing out of
my head so I just took the baby hairs
out the front and just you know left it
the way it was
all right people so this is the final
look of the hair so this video I hope it
was helpful to some of you guys who want
to customize your units so I customized
this entire unit guys for about ten
dollars less than ten dollars so I
always tell you guys that I used a
Revlon color silks because I feel like
the Revlon color silks is amazing so
this time I did go back and purchase it
again and I used that to customize this
blonde wig now initially when I thought
this unit guys it was super duper yellow
kind of like like really really brassy
yellow so I decided to do is get the
Revlon color silks dark blonde and ash
it out so it's not an ash blonde this
time it was just a dark blonde but
because it here was already kind of like
a six thirteen color the dark blonde
worked out perfectly for it and I don't
know if you guys can see in my hair
right now there's dimension two blonde
so what I did was I used two boxes to
cover the ombre portion of this way so I
didn't like kind of saturate the entire
thing I just kind of squirting it on and
kind of put it in certain areas and
stuff like that so that I can achieve
more of a kind of highlighted by
lifestyle unit now the roots on this
unit did come in this like kind of
number six chocolate brown color which I
was not feeling at all so what I ended
up doing guys I ended up using a dark
brown to kind of go into the roots now
as far as going into the roots I didn't
go that deep into the roots the only
part of the roots out of touch was just
right here and just around the perimeter
just to kind of give him more of a
realistic vibe I definitely think I did
a really good job on this this looks
really good and I know a lot of women of
colleges are afraid to wear blonde hair
but if you do a good ash tone out and do
a little bit of dark roots that always
ends up coming out really good so this
is about like my fourth trial of a swan
unit and I think that this is one of the
number one this is on the list of one of
the top three that I like and it's just
great that the hair actually came from
the company already pre on braids now
one thing I bought the pre ombre with
this way from this company I didn't for
a purse a like the color that I ended up
that I got originally I like the way
they did the actual the actual um hot I
put this the way they all braid it was
done well so they didn't like do it kind
of where it's choppy it's almost like an
ombre / balayage so basically the route
was kind of like that brown color and it
kind of like dipped into like the blonde
rice section so you can kind of see it
up here it's kind of like faded
highlights and then goes into this
really nice blonde so they did it their
technique on the ombre was good but the
coloring was just off no I honestly
don't think anybody would honestly buy
that unit and just wear it like that so
if you do want to get a blond unit for
the summer time you want to customize it
yourself I do think that this unit is
nice it's about 150% density so if you
don't like super thick hair it would be
good for you
I'm someone that likes super thick hair
so this is a little bit of a for me I
like about 180 or 200 percent so this is
okay now for me what I probably ends up
doing is cutting this like about up to
here and giving myself kind of one of
those fun crazy messy bobs I think that
would actually look really cute this
year I don't really mind about this
extra length right here I could I could
be fine without the length but what I'll
probably end up doing is just going in
and just chopping it like this and give
giving myself like a nice choppy kind of
messy blonde ombre blob
so I'll let you guys know if I decide to
do that you probably see pictures on
Instagram but for now I think that this
is fabulous and I think that overall
with the experience of dying in and
spinning like nothing to do this guy's I
think it came out really nice so I will
leave all the information down below if
you're interested in purchasing this
unit from well evany and if you're
interested in purchasing the dies to get
this look guys I'll leave all the
information down below
