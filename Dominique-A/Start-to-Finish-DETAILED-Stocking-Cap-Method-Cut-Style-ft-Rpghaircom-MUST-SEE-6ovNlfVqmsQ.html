be a little bit different so today I'm
gonna kind of talk through on how I use
the stocking cap method to do my units
down so the way that I'm going to show
you guys today is from RPG here calm now
this unit is a 360 where you get your
standard three combs comb three at the
top one at the bottom adjustable strap
and this have like a little bit of lace
in the back as well as like three inches
of lace on the top part so what's your
standard 360 wig it did come pre pre pre
please ha pre plucked and a pre pre
bleached in the front so all I did was
just go and cut the baby hairs a little
bit and then just squeeze a little bit
behind the hairline with the baby here
it's alright just to kind of give myself
a little bit more realism so I'm going
to use this stocking cap on my head and
I'm going to use the dot to be good a
spray along with the gotta be gluey
yellow to kind of lay this down and try
this method out there everybody's been
killing so guys I'm really excited about
that
I believe all the specs down below for
this unit it is 18 inches long but I
don't think I'm gonna leave it like that
so you guys will just have to wait to
the end of the video to see so let's get
stored like a lot of bags in the back
but I'm trying to clean house right now
cuz I'm trying to get rid of a lot of
the things that I have because I have
too much clothes at this point it's
becoming crazy my earring just came out
so I think you pull this over your ears
I'm not sure but I'm gonna this is a
trial video hopefully this comes out
successful guys I'm really nervous so
I'm gonna apply the glue first on my
forehead ish now I have a large forehead
so I can go as far as I want and as
short as I want with these types of got
to the glue method just because my
forehead is pretty large so that's the
good thing about having a large forehead
and being able to wear wigs so I guess
is not that much of a curse
anyways so hmm so I guess they applied
like this um listen guys this is my
first time doing this so I'm really
nervous
hoping that this pans out the way I hope
it does so I'm just applying it like I
would apply like on my regular like
scalp I guess I don't know so I'm hoping
that I'm doing this try please don't do
this right do this right do this way but
I mean I figure like if it doesn't like
to stay down and it does stay no like in
the front
like up here and stuff like that I can
just go in after and just be able to
touch it up and I'm pretty sure people
retouch it up after it isn't you know
like fully stay down the way it's
supposed to but what I like to do with
this one is just add like thin layers
and then I let it dry and then once it
actually completely dries then I do a
second layer but I guess that since I
got this spray thing now that I can just
go in right now and just spray the top
of it and I've never used this before
I never use this so it's my first time
so let's go oh my god
it's cold too so I'm in the wind I just
spray the whole entire head down so I'm
looking real oily today mmm Wow so I
hope that this method works I would do
that first and you guys always asked me
about the glue I used a yellow pack I
have not used a black pack but if you
know there's if there's a difference
between the black one and the yellow one
let me know down below because I really
would like to try the black one but I
went to Ulta today and they didn't have
the black one they only had the yellow
one and ironically I don't know if
they're having a sale on these um what
is it oh my gosh I pronounced the
company's name I don't know if they're
having a Selma got to be glue products
but the spray was 399 and it was
originally before that it was a C it was
like 799 something like that so and they
had like a little sale they had a lot of
things on stone they're not just like
holiday shopping was just like I bought
some Real Techniques Beauty blenders I
got rid of my old ones I bought like
some lashes I bought I bought a lot of
stuff here today oh god this little
product that I study using called my
cell water um my solar water I don't is
that what it's called I'm just adding
another lane now cuz what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna step away from the camera
I'm going to actually blow dry my hair
with the blow dryer to speed the process
up I don't know if that's like the
shortcut way wow that was a lot but I'm
gonna spread that out don't worry so I
don't know if that's a shortcut way but
I mean I'm sure I can spray down and
away you know what I'm saying
so I'm going to go and spray not spray
I'm gonna go in and blow-dry the wing
down so that it blow dryer the cap down
so that it just speeds up the process
I'm only adding at
you're heavy layers on this one because
I don't know if I'm doing it right so I
hope that I'm doing it correctly so me
adding these extra heavy layers will
probably solidify the unit but I'm kind
of going in a curved motion because I'm
assuming that since the air times will
land there you want it to stick so yeah
and this week is gonna be worn for a few
days except I'm having a Christmas party
on Saturday so it will be worn until
then cuz I do have a video needs to post
on Sunday and Monday but that's for
another day you just don't worry about
that guys so I'm going to spray one more
time guys and then I'm going to go and
blow-dry this baby damn she cuz I'm the
stocking cap off and I'm terrified to do
this cuz these scissors are not good but
I couldn't find my like actual like
weaving scissors and stuff like that so
I hope I don't cut like a piece of my
skin off um it's actually sticking I'm
actually pretty pleasantly surprised
people is sticking but I feel like I'm
gonna have to go back in and reapply
some extra which is fine trial and error
trial now yeah like I don't is this
sticking or what like guys am I doing
this right or no or no oh my god am i
messing this up no it a stick you know
what you just sticking so I'm just what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna keep it like
that then I'm gonna go in and be apply a
little bit more spray on it oh god am I
doing this right okay so that part okay
okay okay okay I'm a little bit more
confident guys so I'm cutting this off
right now and I'm not gonna edit any of
this out because this is a truant error
like I'm not like professional aren't
this kind of stuff this is a Learning
Channel so we're gonna learn together
okay so that's kind of like semi there
oh god I'm nervous
this isn't I'm nervous so I'm actually
watching YouTube video right now -
that's so funny
I think I messed the side up totally so
guys I don't know if I'm doing this
right so I'm gonna go in and add some
more of this guy's Tube video just to
kind of seal it up a little bit and then
I'm gonna go in and blow dry one more
time with some more spray cuz I don't
know if this is kind of lay the right
way but I am giving this my best shot
you know I'm giving this my best after
my best life so I'm gonna spray one more
time and then I'm gonna go blow-dry
pretty dry so I'm just gonna bring the
wig down oh god is this even like oh wow
it actually stuck I might have to adjust
a little bit of this down but for the
most part okay
wait one second okay okay okay okay okay
oh God
so for the most part this actually stuck
down pretty well and the wig actually
fits pretty good ear to ear too so I'm
feeling a little coffee dollops right
now let me just take this down secateurs
see okay oh
okay so I'm a little bit of confident
that in my hat I might it might work so
let me just put the straps down in the
back as well too but I think I got this
pretty pretty well so what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to just fix up the baby
hairs a little bit and then if I need to
fix them imperfections like some of the
parts I don't really got that much like
the ear tabs are actually pretty good so
let's see mm-hmm okay so something
pretty good guys it's looking pretty
good so I'm just gonna fix the ear type
areas and just put the baby hairs and
then I will
back
alright guys so this is a final result
of the hair so as you guys saw the
beginning of the video I try to talk to
you on the process of the stocking cap
method so one thing I am going to say to
you guys is I think the stocking cap
method is definitely a good method to
use now it definitely makes the hair
very flat so it the reason why it makes
it fly is because the wig will adhere to
the actual cap and you won't have that
cap rolling back and it definitely kind
of gives you more of a realistic look
now I do think that sometimes when I do
my wigs naturally sometimes it has like
a natural hairline love and that's
mostly because I have a large forehead
so I haven't enough space on my large
forehead to place my unit which is a
good thing for me so that's one thing I
kind of utilized with my head because if
even if my hairline is right here I can
still pull the wig down a little bit
further down here to kind of make it
look realistic but the thing that I
notice is that with this a stocking cap
method that wig won't slide back or kind
of lift too early just because it has
something to stick on so that's one
reason why the stocking cap method is
probably better suited for people who
want to kind of wear the wigs for a
longer time now I have the wig on for
about two days now and I think that it
looks really good I went out to that I
got hats I got so many compliments from
people they were like you know that
looks like a real hair now this hair
like I said before in the beginning the
video if I did not mention it
this unit is from RPG here calm it is 18
inches originally but I did cut it it is
a Yaqui texture it's 150% density so the
video try to do like a complete video so
I didn't know what I was gonna do with
the unit initially I kind of thought I
was gonna cut it or leave it the way it
was but then I opted to cut it just
because I have a lot of black just kind
of like dark black wigs that are long so
I wanted to kind of do something a
little bit different so I decided to do
kind of like kind of like a natural wrap
type of look so I cut the wig I'm not
professional guys whatsoever so I kind
of like played around with the scissors
I even do the ponytail method when I
when it came to cutting in the back just
because I couldn't see it my friend is a
hair stylist and she's really good I
could have waited for her to cut it but
I was like you know what the whole
purpose of this video the whole purpose
of this channel is a Learning Channel so
I try
do my best to show you guys how I
achieve this look so I'm gonna turn it
around and show you guys at the back
looks like guys it's really cute but I
definitely like I can go in and kind of
fix up some parts a little bit just
because it's really jagged in the back
but for the most part guys the unit
actually looks really nice and it works
really well so I'm really really excited
about that so guys I will leave the
information down below for you guys if
