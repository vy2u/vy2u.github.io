different
so I'm gonna show you guys how I get a
natural hair line so this video is gonna
be very detailed so you guys gonna see
all aspects so I did show you guys in
the beginning of tweezing the hair
before I even do anything to it by
closing down on my head so you will see
the glowing process and all that kind of
stuff so this is a full video
this unit is Rebecca Lee Swisscom is to
style number GLW double-oh-seven
it's a natural hair color - 18 inches
long 150% density in someone's curly
texture now this sooner guys obviously
be seen the beginning the video it's
very very pretty and I think I did a
really good job it's a very simple thing
I'm not like a master tweezer or a
master hair stylist so I think I did a
really good job of it if you're beginner
you're unsure how to do this
so that I can really seal the curls and
once it dries out you guys are gonna see
how to find the curls are they in for
the curl pattern is really on this here
guys and I would definitely recommend if
you're going to get this don't wear it
the way it comes definitely go in and
wet in style and kind of let it air dry
it definitely has been awesome love when
it's dry it's really good
hey guys how's it going so this unit
that I'm sporting today guys is from
best lace wigs calm so this is a 360
unit guys it is a natural wave and it's
about 18 inches long so I will leave all
the specs down below if you guys are
interested in this unit so basically
what I did in the video guys I kind of
showed you guys how I tweeze the
hairline and stuff like that
it was pretty tweeze but I wanted to go
in and kind of do some more emphasis on
the hairline just to kind of bring it
out more and make it look a little bit
more realistic now I didn't kind of do
like a definitive part all I did was
just kind of throw my hand through the
part with my nails and just kind of make
like a jagged part I sometimes feel like
when you do jagged parts and stuff like
that with curly hair it kind of looks a
little bit better I could have done a
complete flip over method but I kind of
feel like I need a like a little bit of
parting space so that it looked more
realistic I do like the hair so what I
do is add my can to twist and lock
leave-in conditioner along with some
water and a little bit of argan oil and
I basically let the hair air dry so it's
completely air dried now and you guys
can see the curl pattern the curl
pattern or wave pattern on this one is
really really pretty it is on dutiful
it's 150 percent density I wish it was
like 200% density because it would have
been like so much buff and it would
actually look a little bit better now I
do like it like this if you're someone
that doesn't like a lot of hair and we
are transitioning to the springtime in
summer so if you're looking for a nice
low-maintenance curly type of unit this
one is actually really nice for that
type of occasion it's really lightweight
guys and because it's 150% density it's
really not gonna bother you too much on
your back and your neck you're not gonna
have to worry about a lot of irritation
the hair is super soft I did not receive
any tangling and shedding so far a lot
of it tangling you're kind of receiving
on curly units we'll start in the nape
area but so far I have not received any
tangling from this unit I think like I
said I did go in I did like a more a
little bit exaggerated a baby hair magic
up in the front I usually don't do that
but when I was playing with I was like
oh that's really nice and natural so let
me just go ahead and just play around
extra with it I normally don't wear it
like too much like this in the front but
hey she tried something new some people
like it like this and some people don't
it's a really nice texture guys they're
just trying to do like kind of like a
flip over method half flip over method
and kind of not it is so you can see
that some of the curls defined but when
you're letting the hair air dry just do
not touch it I was sitting here playing
with the hair a lot so you do see like a
little bit of frizzy spots in it just
because I kept putting my hands in it to
kind of confirm that was completely dry
the ends of the hair or drive but
obviously the root is still a little bit
wet so definitely just don't touch it
and let it air dry and you'll get like a
really nice pop curl like the bottom
here is it's like a really nice pop
ringlet curl which i think is so so cute
