lace front unit so this one has three
combs in the front want to come in the
back with adjustable strap it does come
with about 3.5 inches of parting space
which is perfect so basically what I'm
gonna show you guys in this video if I
lose this unit down and customize the
hairline to make it look natural now I
do have to put a little bit of work into
this unit so that I can make it look as
natural as possible in the hairline area
but I do like this unit guys it fits
very well in my head I'm usually a
medium cap size so this unit works very
very well so for this part guys I'm
gonna actually use my Aussie instant
freeze hairspray to actually use as kind
of like a freezing block I ran out of
the got to be glue inside think that the
awesome is pretty good it's extra hold
and I just put this on so that the unit
could stay down a little bit better so
at this part I'm just adjusting the unit
on my head it fits a very guy good guys
here to ear now you can see right now
straight up there's like no hair line
magic so I'm definitely gonna have to
open this unit up to make it look as
that go as possible but this is gonna be
light work simple workers
new to this I'm true today
Oh
so basically what I'm doing in this part
guys really tweezing the hairline now
when I first got it wasn't tweeze enough
so I really have to go in and kind of
make some space into this unit so I
don't want to do too much in the front
cause I don't want it to make bald spots
so I kind of go from the front to the
back and kind of dig in the middle a
little bit sometimes in the area of the
hair it's kind of bulky at the top I
like to go in and sit out a little bit
so that's all I'm doing this section I'm
not a professional nectars I just kind
of go and see where I'm act I'm gonna
keep taking looks just to make sure that
I'm not volume in a perimeter just
because you don't want to have quads
alright guys so you definitely know let
it start to finish until I starts down
the unit so this you know I'm just
running my straightener through it just
to give it a few curls nothing crazy
guys I just want to kind of give myself
a little bit of a bump so that it's
styled properly so then what I'm going
to do is actually go to the bang area
and kind of do like a soft curl and then
strain at the end I definitely like that
kind of like frisky kind of like
freewill type of hair sour it's not all
the way perfect so that's just please
good I'm gonna do it this unit I will
turn around and show you guys at the
back like so you can see what the
potential is of the back as well
Oh
so basically what I'm gonna do in this
part guys I'm just killing the baby here
I'm going to just fix him up so that it
doesn't look too exaggerated it just
looks really natural and light now the
baby here is in the tweezing job that I
did are actually really good I didn't
take too much hair off which is perfect
so I'm just going to go and fix them up
I'm actually going to use my curling
iron just to press the surface so
therefore it's kind of like almost
blended into my skin I want it to look
as realistic as possible and have kind
of like that soft baby doll hair type of
effect
all right guys so this is the finished
look of this unit so this is the
hairstyle final review so based on this
unit this video is kind of a start to
finish video so I wanted to show you
guys how I kind of brought the hairline
to life and kind of brought the whole
styling to life so this is what I
basically got with this unit guys and I
love it so I have reviewed a unit for my
first wings before that's similar to
this one the one that I reviewed before
was a little bit shorter in the bang
area and it didn't have this kind of
like angle so I definitely think that
this one is definitely one that I
absolutely love the other one was
definitely a little bit shorter this is
kind of the hairstyle that I have like
naturally my sides are a little bit
shorter than this but I always have my
bang like this and I just absolutely
love it on my natural hair so basically
what I want to do is emphasize how I
tweezed it in the beginning the hairline
was there was like really no no tweezing
done to this unit so you really have to
put your focus on this one my first wigs
just specialized to help you out with
first wig buyers first wing where so
hope this videos informative for those
who have never worn wigs before and want
to kind of achieve something like this
now this also this wig also is good for
someone who wears like a lot of long
units a lot of straight units a lot of
curly units and stuff like that and I've
never been able or never was kind of
afraid to dip into short hair this unit
that's really nice look you guys I know
you guys saw my reaction when I was
doing the beginning of a video I was
just kind of like wow this is actually
like a really nice wig now um I tried
the boys girls guys it didn't do
anything as far as cutting so I left
everything virtually the way it was
besides tweezing it and cutting baby
hairs so I just went in and curled this
section right here and then I even went
in the back and just pulled a few curls
of micro strain err just to kind of make
it more of a structured or curled style
unit I don't really feel like I need to
cut this I kind of felt the cut was
perfect if you want you can go in with
likes a little bit of a razor and kind
of dim these section hair because it is
a little bit long
but I do like it just because it kind of
looks real as far as the bang goes the
bang is pretty good it's not really like
a super duper full bang and I can show
you guys a hairline look at the hairline
in the front right here even when I
throwing my hands back and throw it back
and
yo it just looks super duper like like
come on guys it's like look at like
where are you gonna find a wig at that's
gonna do all this type of stuff like
only over here so my first words
definitely has their game perfectly
presented they know how to provide units
for people who want to try something
different and who want to kind of like
step out the box I definitely think for
a lace front wig this is definitely a
one as far as the part in space goes
this actually came party like this and
it's a curved part and look at how far
the curved part goes guys it goes all
the way back here so it's about like
four and a half to five inches of
parting space which is excellent and
like I said four units like this you get
the parting space more so in the crown
area which is kind of like right here
like this whole entire oval which is
perfectly fun because most of the hair
stars are gonna do with this it's just
basically like this you definitely can
go ahead and do kind of like those
little cute little hairstyles need you
like the braids or whatever and stuff
like that but I'm probably just gonna
keep mine so wait it's like this I love
this hairstyle I just kind of ran my
curling iron through it just to give it
like a little bit of a bump and a little
bit of like a straight and I love that
kind of fun look I don't know I'm just
obsessed with that so yeah so I
definitely think this is a unit guys
that I would highly recommend if you
want to try something different for the
summertime you're not gonna have to
worry about hair all on your back being
all hot and sweaty and if you want that
kind of sexy classy kind of like ang a
little bit this definitely has kind of
like an edgy sexy look to it so I
definitely am feeling it so guys I will

unit from my first once calm do not
