today with another wig Wednesday video
so this video today guys is sponsored by
my first wigs calm so they just launched
their first every 360 unit so this is
their baby right here so this website is
a website customized for people who are
first-time week whereas first time with
buyers so a lot of the units that they
actually sell are very like first-time
buyer friendly so it's not gonna be a
unit that you're gonna have to work too
hard for but you can find ways to
customize the unit
so in this videos basically I could
start to finish video so in the
beginning I showed you guys the wig when
I was kind of basic AF and this is a
final result look that I got with this
360 wig now I'm rich you guys can
already tell that I really am feeling
this because I had to like design myself
up I had to put the eyeshadow on today
the earrings off the children's ha I
came to do with this look and I honestly
and truly I'm gonna say that I really
really really like this 360 now 360s are
kind of trending like every company
sells 360 wigs but this 360 wig in
particular is very different because
this one is actually one that you can
really glue down in the back now I will
turn around and show you guys at the
back as I say that's exactly I'm talking
about a lot of the companies when they
do 360s
in the back they don't leave enough
space for you to actually grab the lace
and glue it down
my first wigs calm actually creates like
an extra patch where you can actually
glue that patch down which is lace and
you can actually glue that patch down
still gonna be secured down so when I
saw that on the back of this wig I was
like wet so I in the beginning of the
video I think I kind of paused it if I
freeze it for you guys to see exactly
what I'm talking about like like not a
lot of companies do that guys and this
one they do do it for you so therefore
if you're looking to wearing a high buns
like this or ponytails you can achieve
the look with no issues whatsoever so
that's one thing that I definitely like
so this unit is probably gonna
definitely be my up style unit I just
like guys like look at that like I'm
really enthusiastic because this week is
pretty poppin so I will turn around show
you guys what it looks like obviously
one thing I did add to my packet this
time is this fly way tamer that they
starting to give it says say goodbye to
frizzy hair
the issue with this unit guys is here it
was not frizzy at all and if I do part
it down the middle part of the other
side and have flyaways it's basically
like a cream consistency that they give
you or like a kind of like a paste yeah
it's kind of like a paste or whatever
you just put it on the flyaways and I'll
kind of tame them down so I thought this
was really nice so I'll probably use
this on the unit if I decide to split it
down the middle or split it to the side
so I've never seen this before so this
is the first so definitely check that
out when you purchase your unit thought
this is cool now this unit that I'm
wearing guys like I said it's a 360 unit
it is silky straight and this one is it
is 200% density now you guys know I'm
obsessed with thick units now this is
200% density and it's a real 200%
density if you guys saw when I showed
you guys how I styled it in a ponytail
the ponytail was a moving so not a lot
of units that you'll get like like if
you do like 130 percent that in a
ponytail form is a mess 150 and a
ponytail form is a mess 180 will cut
will make the cut and about 200 make the
final cut so this makes the final cut
for a ponytail to our bun style I do not
have any fillers in my button right now
this is the bun just from all the hair
use are all the hair on the wig so it's
kind of like bitch so guys I'm really
enthusiastic about this I really like
this a lot the hair line for me guys all
I did was going is tweezing tweezing
hair line a little bit and bring out the
kind of the Miss scalp to make it look
realistic so I hope you guys can see the
emphasis that I did on it I think it
looks really good I did a really good
job now this is not really hard for
someone to do if you're in the first
time I just kind of like tweeze like
just sporadically just tweeze the hair
I'm not professional at that so I did
the best I could so I hope that that
helped you guys in the beginning of the
video and I showed you guys how the hair
was straight out the back so looks good
I don't do any additives to this this is
what it is alright guys so that
basically wraps up this video I hope you
guys enjoyed this video today do not
