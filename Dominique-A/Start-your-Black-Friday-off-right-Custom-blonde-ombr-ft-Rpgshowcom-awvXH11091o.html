this week that I'm supporting today's
from our PG show calm now I'm gonna have
to read it for my phone to tell you guys
exactly all the specs on this baby so
this is supposed to be the middle part
dope wavy human here lace wig the color
is basically like an ombre style color
it's a custom unit so when you click the
link down below you will see exactly the
customize link and all that stuff for
this unit now this unit is 20 inches
long it's silky straight it's pre
plucked hairline and it is definitely a
200% density wig now in this unit guys
in the beginning when I first got it I
was a little bit like weary about it I
just maybe it was because the back when
I used lighting the setting it was just
not working out so I kind of went back
to my old way of doing my hair views
when I kind of just do it like in this
position just because you guys can see
full view exactly what this unit looks
like so I do like this unit now that
I've kind of toned down the background
and I kind of did like more of a simple
makeup look just AM accident blonde now
I'm usually the type of person that will
kind of go into ashes blend out because
I thought the blonde was a little bit
too kind of like beginner dyeing style
wise and not trying to play the company
anything like that
but it looked like somebody who just
didn't know how to bleach hair and they
just bleached it and just that it was
like that's the process so I was a
little bit worried about that but once I
kind of style the wig and kind of put my
look together I said to myself okay Tom
this is actually really cute holiday wig
so I'm like let's definitely be one for
Christmas New Year's now I just show you
guys in the video that I curl on my hair
the curl one that I use is from Diwali
calm I will link that information down
below you guys asked me before how I
curl on my hair so I wanted to show you
guys a little snippet of it in this
video so that's basically what I did
with the hairstyle originally when I got
the unit they pre curled it for me but I
didn't like the curls because I didn't
like the middle part I just kind of felt
like it was too flat at the top to have
a middle part like that and have curls
the front part had it needed a little
bit more layers and they did add layers
in this unit so if you watch you'll see
like shorter parts in the front here
which is perfect but for it to be a
middle part style it just did not look
like fun so I definitely like this a lot
the hair line is pre plucked so it's
pretty realistic looking guys it does
have a good amount of parting space so I
just did like an
little curved side part now I did do my
powder like I usually do not link the
powder down below for you guys it is the
BH Cosmetics contour kit and it's a
powder contour kit so it's nothing crazy
it's just a regular face powder contour
powder etc etc etc so I kept it real
simple guys I do like to hear wig once I
styled it differently in the beginning I
just did not like it but I had to put a
little bit of a different look on it try
to change it up a little bit in order to
really like it and appreciate the wig
itself so I'm honestly gonna tell you
guys I do like it a lot now so when you
first get the wig don't assume that
you're just gonna put on your head and
gonna go
you always have to customize the unit's
to look exactly the way they should look
or look away that's gonna look good on
you so definitely keep that in mind when
you're purchasing your wig guys so I
will leave all the information down
below for you guys so you guys are
interested in purchasing this baby from
our PG show calm do not forget guys to
