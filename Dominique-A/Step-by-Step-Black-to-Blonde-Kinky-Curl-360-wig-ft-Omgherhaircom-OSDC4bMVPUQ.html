I kind of worked my way up guys I just
kind of bring your color up I honestly
thought I was gonna do like a balayage
styled curly in it but then I thought
like maybe it'd be cute if I did a full
color reason so I think I'm going to do
a full color so I'm just gonna work my
way all the way up this is a lot of hair
guys
I recommend like dampening the hair
before doing this part just because it's
a lot of hair
so this is the full look of it so far
now once I cool watch this you know guys
I actually let it air-dry over 90 fires
did my second process second processing
for me is to cut it on the hair down so
I'm going to use something that I've
been using for years to tone it very
inexpensive and I think that actually
came out really nice look psycho watch
it the curls are super popping the hair
looks very soft and very very pretty
guys
so the major objective that you want to
achieve with this unit guys is to really
saturate this hair with all the hair dye
I use all four boxes in here and die
dark ash one to color this entire unit
once you're done using all the color I'm
using the clear on box side so I'm going
to do the side the edges the permitter
and I'm also going to go in and do
parting space on this one as well just
to keep it as realistic as possible
sometimes you do like a full full eye
way
it comes off
all right guys now when it's wet it
definitely has like a grayish tone to it
once this air dries you guys are going
to see how beautiful the color ends up
looking like it's going to be so
fatigued and I'm just gonna add a little
bit of product to the curls just to make
sure that they're gonna be completely
fine so what I'm going to use to show
you guys how I customize the unit's
do some baby hairs tweeze it a little
bit and style it now this is a natural
leg that I'm using right now so
therefore you can see all the aspects of
this beautiful ash blonde color it came
out so great and its inventions and the
blondes are really nice now you can see
that the boots are not black they're
almost like a dark brown and I think
that I did at the jobs that exact
they're just because it looks like it's
grown from my scalp once I have the
finishing touches
alright guys so this is the final look
of this unit guys so I'm super duper
pleased with the results of the coloring
job that I've done with this one now I
do love Ashe one you guys know I'm like
a Asheville and crazy type of chick I do
a lot of the custom ash blonde things
units and I've always recommended to you
guys when you're doing ash black try to
keep it really affordable I use Revlon
color silks like it's nobody's business
just because they're cheap I've been
using it for years guys and it's only
two thousand sixty eight cents at
Walmart so you can't beat that guys and
it does a great job now I did fully
bleach this entire unit blonde and then
after I bleached it I went in and added
the dark ash blonde from Revlon color
silks and I processed that for about an
hour after I wash the entire unit out I
went back and did a touch-up and did
some dark roots and this is the final
results guys it's perfect I love it I
was a little afraid in the beginning
just because the texture is very kinky
and I was afraid that it would just be
just too much going on with the hair but
once that kind of a out styled it
up and I was like yo this is actually
pretty cute even in the beginning when I
was um actually fixing the part and
stuff like that when I actually thought
I wanted to wear the side part even like
a side part flip over meth it looks so
cute with this just because it looks
effortless it looks sunkissed it looks
summer it looks spring it just has that
look to it that I really really like so
I'm very pleased that it's I'm able to
style this several ways so this unit was
set to me guys from oMG her hair calm
now this is a 360 unit guys and it's
about 18 inches long 150% density so
their units do come pre plus in the
front so I did a little bit of plucking
I didn't need to but I was trying to be
extra as usual so I did a little bit of
plucking and just add a powder on it and
this is what it looks like
I could style like I said I styled it on
the side part and then I ended up doing
a top bun just because I felt like the
top will look really clean really fresh
and really kind of spring/summer like I
sing so I thought that it looks really
good like this I
I've been really obsessed with these
kinky curly units two straight ones that
they provide om jr. provides and as well
as this one they've just stolen my heart
completely I really do like it guys and
like I said I added powder on it and the
powder that I use is the bh cosmetics
contour palette and it's just like a
powder palette and it's already broken
up guys you don't have to buy that
paddle like I always say you can just
use a regular face powder or kind of
like a contour powder to achieve the
powdered look so don't get crazy with
stuff like that just kind of use
whatever contour powder you have or
whatever kind of face powder you have
and you'll be perfectly fine so guys I'm
definitely really pleased with the
results of this one I think it looks
really natural it looks really fun you
can see kind of little dimensions of
colors like some parts would be like
darker blond and then you'll get like
some nice kind of light blond so it just
came out
excellent so guys I will leave all the
information down below if you're
