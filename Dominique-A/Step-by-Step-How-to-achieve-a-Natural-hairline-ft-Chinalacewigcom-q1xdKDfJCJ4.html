with another hair video so this hair
video today guys is provided by China
lace wigs calm so I think I've done at
least two ombre style units from them
I've done one red one in one kind of
like Christmas in green color and I've
never done like a blonde one from them
so they did send me like this kind of 1b
30 colored ombre styled unit so this is
a 360 wig guys so you get about three to
four inches of parting space in the
front and about two inches of parting
space in the back so you can do high
ponytails buns all that kind of stuff so
what I'm going to do in today's video
guys is you just do another step by step
on how I lay my unit so this one's
different cuz I'm not doing the stocking
cap method you guys saw the stocking cap
method one that I did and I actually
thought that one came out perfect and
I'll link that video up here somewhere
for you guys so you guys want to see
that video so this one I'm just gonna
leave 360 down trying to lace wigs
definitely has some good units one thing
about the units that I like is that it's
pre plucked so therefore they're pre
plucking game is on point so you really
don't have to do too much I'll show you
guys what I do to Mize and I'll talk to
you guys as I do it so that you guys
kind of get to understanding I know
sometimes people like when I do videos
like that when I'm explaining what I'm
doing because it just makes it easier
for someone who doesn't know how to do
this to learn so I'm gonna do that with
this unit and I'm gonna try to see what
I can do in regards to the styling
process now the color for me guys is
just not what I you know what what kind
of like run and die for the one be 30
the color is kind of brassy and it's
almost kind of like Oh
Dom in 2010 when she was beginning at
this and she didn't know how to you know
like tone her hair or kind of bleach
hair you know when you just like
beginning and you're like bleaching your
bun nose and you end up with this color
and you just didn't know that you could
tone it so this is what that looks like
so I would say if you purchased this you
and I definitely tone the hair or just
change the color the here's already
blonde so you can definitely put like a
purple green or blue on it and it will
just take the color like that so if you
want to do that you can do that with
this unit I'm gonna keep it this way and
try to make it I'm gonna try to finagle
yeah I'm going to so I'm going to try to
do something different with it and if
you stay tuned to the rest of the video
you will see what I do so guys if you're
interested in seeing how I switch this
baby up and how I glue my units down
peruse
then I would like you to stay tuned and
keep online alright guys so this is what
the unit looks like I did not cut the
lace up I just want to show you guys the
color so like I said the 360 you are
going to get it all the way around I
will take it off and show you guys
before I cut the lace off though it's
really nice to hear it's very soft guys
I am NOT going to do anything as far as
the curl curling or doing anything and
if I do you guys will see that part but
this is what it looks like straight off
the bad guys I actually think it's
really really nice now that I look at it
in the Sun I do have my diva ring light
on and I do have my window cracked a
little bit I didn't you know for a
little bit of natural light but yeah I
think that this is cute I'm gonna take
it off and show you guys before I cut
the lace so that you guys can see what
the back looks like in the front but I'm
kind of feeling kind of like a bun or
something right now like you know
something like that
and we will see so I'm gonna try to do a
close-up because people keep telling me
that I'm writing like filters on the
close-ups I don't know so I'm just to
close up so you guys can see like
straight up what it looks like alright
guys so I cut the lace off so this is
what it looks like around the perimeter
and basically falls perfect on ear to
ear
I will insert down below exactly what
the circumference is on this unit but
this is ear to ear fits me perfect and
us and see how nice and secure it is
like I said it's pre plucked in the
front obviously doesn't see that so what
I'm gonna do is a my got to be glue on
and I don't know if I'm gonna say I'm
gonna glue the back time because the
back actually fits pretty well too so if
I'm able to put this up in a ponytail in
the back down then we weren't we're not
gonna glue the back down guys alright so
let me come I got to be glue ready I'm
going to use the glue and the freezing
spray but I think I'm actually running
out of the freezing spray I'm crossing
my fingers that I'm not because I would
like to use that and it actually is
really good if you add it on top of the
on top of the yellow one for your to
glue your wings down so use that
freezing spray the freezing spray
actually works pretty good so let me see
if I still have it
and then I'll come back and glue this
baby my hair in a bun in the back and
this is the stocking cap I use a brown
stocking cap and I just want to show you
guys I don't know this is what I use
even though I powder
on top of it so that's what I use and
I'm trying to like have my little edges
so don't snatch me up but this doesn't
even do anything to my edges honestly
people say that they lose their edges
from the gotta be glue but I haven't
experienced that I just really don't
have that have a little bald spots on my
edges but that's not from the got to
that's just for me being negligent as
with my hair so I'm going to use the
gossipy cool I told you that let me use
the yellow one the other one for me
works fine some people think the black
one is better but I've already done a
video and I'll link that video up here
the black one for me is better when
you're doing baby hair magic I don't
think it's that good when you're trying
to glue the actual unit down I prefer
using the yellow one cuz the yellow one
just it's very very secure I kind of
feel like the black one is kind of
almost like a like a play version of the
yellow one it's kind of like it wants to
stick but it doesn't stick and I'm kind
of like I don't have time for that I
need this to stick and that's just what
it is but the yellow one to me are the
black one to me just it's like as comas
like is just playing around with you
like if I if I bought that one and
didn't get the yellow one and I went
home and try to go my unit then I be
pissed because it just it's more for
baby hair magic I want to say get that
if you're going to want to adhere your
way down for at least a few days and of
course the text messages start and I
think I hear the trend coming by but
whatever we're going to disregard that
so like I said I prefer using the yellow
one if you really try to get a four to
five day grip there are a lot of other
adhesives coming I like the guerrilla
snot I haven't tried that one yet but if
you guys want me to try the gorilla snot
went down leave it down in the
description bar and I will try to go
description bar leave it down in the
comments and I'll try the gorilla snot
and yeah so I'm gonna put this on let
the first layer dry I'm actually gonna
spray this now now this spray guys I'm
running out it's like really towards the
end I am only running out of this guy's
because I use this when I curl my hand
crap my hair and it's like a great hair
spray like in general like a hair spray
for your leg curls styles and stuff like
that it'll hold your curls really really
long and also give you like a nice kind
of really pretty deep wave hair style
and you guys already know I am obsessed
with deep wave hairstyle I'm actually
gonna upload in another video I'm gonna
do another hair of you for another
company and then just add that how to
deep wave my hair into the whole entire
video
I feel like when I do videos like that
for you guys you guys prefer those when
I kind of make it like a nice you know
comprehensive type video so I'm gonna
try to do that with that whole styling
as well too so yeah like I said I use
this all the time and there goes a try
alright guys so I'm going to use the got
to be glue spray I guess I don't have
that much left in here because I use
this as styling I use this for styling
like my curls and stuff like that so
yeah so I'm just gonna get this spray oh
my god I'm running out I'm running I'm
running out I might not you know I'm
only gonna get like one layer to spray
on to be honest with you guys I really
try to hit the air type section because
the air type section for me is really
hard to get down and I don't know if
anyone else has that experience with the
air top section is probably by far the
hardest part to keep down and then on
top of that what you trying to uh use
your headscarf on the air tab section
that also becomes an issue because you
want to actually get the whole thing it
just is a mess so I'm going to show you
guys and do it all up and stuff like
that but so far this is the first layer
I'm gonna let this dry I'm gonna come
back and I don't think I'm gonna do two
layers of got to be glue this thing I'm
just gonna do one layer and see if the
one layer really adheres sometimes I'll
do two layers left the first layer dry
and then go back but because I use a
freezing spray I'm just gonna just do
one layer and the freezing spray and
then be done with it I'll have to go
back and do too much and just keep it
the way it is like this so yeah so I
know you guys are probably thing like oh
um like tell us about Thailand
I'll guys Thailand was freaking amazing
I honestly have to wear a lot of these
high neck shirts for now because I got
super tanned I had like those little
metallic those metallic body art things
and they kind of tan me all off so look
it this is my color and this is a color
end up getting so I'm a bit 10 in this
areas like specially the bathing suit
ears and stuff like that so I'm just
trying to you know I should've did a low
today
maybe later up with some aloe on but I'm
just trying to protect myself for now
until my color comes back fortunately I
did wear hats most of the time like my
baseball cap so I kinda like the beach
hat so my face didn't really change and
color wise so it's just kind of like off
right now like the rest of my body's
really like a shade darker and then I'm
kind of still relaxing on the regular
color so
kind of weird but that's part of
vacationing I like to get a tan to
change my cuffs on to get back people
are like oh you went somewhere so yeah
so guys imma let this join now so after
some further evaluation I've come to the
conclusion that this is dry enough you
can also hit it with a blow dryer but I
don't ever really do that so I believe
is dry still has a little bit of
tackiness which I actually like because
once I put my headscarf on it'll
actually really be like permanently
placed so I'm just gonna pull it down I
like to grab the air tabs though because
the air tabs are really hard like I said
to get down so if you grab them first in
the initiate okay air tabs down first
and at least bring the way cuz I don't
know why display this back like that but
you initiate the air tabs down first you
really won't run into too many issues
after that because that's the hardest
part to actually get down and then if
you make a mistake at the air ties
meaning you didn't put enough glue you
have enough time to go back and add some
more glue so that the layers actually
dried through so um see we're getting a
little bit of bubbling right here so
maybe I was wrong maybe I was wrong
maybe I should sit the top first and
then to the air tops after there's no
right or wrong I'm just you know testing
the waters out so it's telling me I need
to pull it down a little bit so I'm just
gonna pull it down from the side here
and as you can see right here guys it's
starting to lay pretty nicely and
actually the front right here played
pretty freakin well so um it's telling
me the lace is telling me that the ear
tabs need a little bit more glue I
didn't go further down further and far
enough so I'm going to add some more
glue and I'm gonna let that dry too
unfortunately the spray is kind of like
done for right now so I'm just gonna add
some glue on the areas that I need glue
still because I need to cover that area
and like I said the air tabs are the
hardest part guys to get down so you
really kind of have to like work you
know work on it and just don't drop
don't just like give up like you really
have to kind of put your effort into the
air tabs especially if you want the unit
to lay down pretty flawlessly I would
say girl just work on it so I'm gonna
actually let this part dry down and I'm
gonna actually use a back of this comb
just to kind of really melt this in my
skin and you guys could see that my
guess
blew my hair but don't worry I'll take
all that stuff up after and you see that
and I'm gonna show you I use witch hazel
to take off some of the the crustiness
you can use alcohol or anything like
that but you can already see you guys
there's a little crustiness right here
but you can already see how it's melting
into my skin right here you really can't
tell and you guys I'm gonna come up
closings hopefully when I come up close
you guys can see but yeah so this is a
portion here that we're really trying to
adhere down and then I'm gonna get the
sides right here as well I do not bleach
my knots guys but if you guys want me to
do a video on how I bleach my knots and
stuff like that then I can do a video on
how I bleach my knots for you guys I
never do it so it'll be like a first
time video and you guys can see me
either mess up or actually be successful
at it so just leave your comments down
below so I've already laid this part
down and you guys will see like a lot of
trust in the got to be glue we all know
that's an issue it got to be glue
they'll probably come up with something
that's not flaky but for now we are
going to just go ahead and just deal
with it so that's I lay down I will
clean that up
after all that everything dry actually
get really imprinted with the headscarf
so I'm just gonna lay this part on here
and I could use my fingers but I like to
use a comb for these parts just because
I don't want like the oils from my
fingers to really mess up the ear type
section that's like the worst so I don't
really care about the front with the
front you can also when you do the baby
hair magic in the front you can just add
more glue on it it'll always be like
balm calm in the front but it's all the
issues that I always encounter and that
a lot of people leave a comments down
below and they encounter the same thing
is the ear tabs those are the worst but
like I said I think the way I explained
it to you guys will be sufficient enough
but you can see that ear tab is pretty
much down you can actually scoop it back
see that so what I'm gonna do is just
put the head scarf down now for like 15
minutes I'm gonna go make myself a salad
and then I'll be right back guys alright
guys so it's been on my head for about
like 30-40 minutes now I had to make
myself something to eat so I'm taking it
off now and hopefully it's pretty stuck
down I'm pretty sure yes it's good don't
die alright so some of the baby hair got
caught in the glue which I actually like
when it happens like that cuz then I
don't have to do too much of that baby
hair magic
so I'm happy that some of the baby here
is actually created and like kind of
stuffed on themselves so I'm not gonna
go in and try to do all those little
swig goals and stuff like that because
sometimes those swig goals are kind of
unnecessary I like doing it sometimes
but not all the time
so this is what the ear tabs look like
which like I said is always a major
point to me so I am gonna go tweeze into
this area right here but let me just
clean it up first let's see so yeah so I
just like this part see this is good
sometimes we'll have it when it's kind
of like and I got some glue on my ear
too so this is basically what I like
when it's like glued down like this
obviously I'll go in and clean this
stuff off too probably use some water
because I can't find my witch hazel at
this point and you can see right here is
actually glued pretty well too so I like
to tweeze this area ground here just
because I want to open it up a little
bit more to make it look more realistic
they do good job pre plucking the front
perimeter and stuff like that but that
kind of like they forget about the sides
the side definitely makes a difference
if you're gonna wear your hair and a
ponytail or and stuff like that so I'm
just gonna go and over here and open
this area up so I'm going to fast
forward that part but I'm gonna make it
close as possible say yes and see
everything so you're not kind of like in
the dark when I'm doing the tweezing but
like I said I will not touch up here I
am only gonna touch the perimeter sides
right here as well as this side right
here guys so just give me a second I'm
gonna bang
so before I go ahead and clean up the
white patches from the got to be glue I
am going to actually cut the baby hairs
a little bit on the size just because
they're too long so I'm just going to
use my regular blade nothing special I
usually use the eyebrow thing but I
don't know where mine is a so this will
work so I'm just going to chop a lot off
cuz I do not like it when it's too long
like it just like a perfect link like
this same thing for this side right here
two guys just kind of get a good amount
off and I don't like them too long
because it just too much around the face
and then when you're trying to sweep
them I'm just gonna take a little bit
off the front ones as well too so that
it just just falls in a nice place but I
like how these are going up into the bun
so I'm actually gonna leave these right
here alone cuz they're going up and they
kind of blend perfectly like that but
these right here will just be perfect
good so I'm gonna cut this one till I
try to match it the same way if it
doesn't match it's okay but I try to get
it as close to the other length as
possible so what I'm gonna do now is
just use a little bit of my got to be
glue and I had a tube brush my hair
toothbrush that I always use for my size
but I don't know where it's at so I'm
just gonna put this on I'm just gonna
put a little bit of a gossip eagle on
the S side so I'm actually gonna sweep
so for instance right here I'm gonna
sweep this side right here so I'm just
gonna curb that one a little bit and I'm
gonna do like this in the beginning
because I usually break the got to be
cool clap cast off of it I don't like
when it's stuck like that initially so
I'm gonna break the cast off after so I
just usually just do it like that for
now I'm also gonna do this area right
here just like a little sleeve nothing
crazy cuz I still have to have my powder
and stuff like that but I'm going to put
this on first so then after it's sat on
there for a few minutes I'll just break
the cast after I just don't want to have
too much of that like baby here magic
going on with this unit right here so we
just put it like right like where the
baby here is gonna start just kind of
sweep it in like that so that kind of
has like this look realistic like vibe
or whatever and I'm also gonna do it
with this one right here cuz this one
right here is long but I only do it in
the front guys I don't go all the way
and try to
pull it up up somebody's doing it in the
front region of the unit so there we go
and I leave the side ones alone until
I'm ready so I'm just gonna put the Hat
stuff back on for like five minutes
and then I'm gonna come back and clean
up the surface and add some powder so
yes and see what it looks like over so
I'm just going to use a little bit of
this hydrogen peroxide that I have and
I'm just going to wipe out the white
areas so right here where my ear tab is
that in my ear there's like some white
flaky sticky stuff so I'm just gonna
wipe those parts off so that when I do
go ahead and add the powder it's not
like distracting I don't have to add too
much powder see that's already coming
off that's great
so I'm just gonna add that on there and
even around where the got to be booths
that just take it off the edges and
stuff like that
and actually took my hair at the
ponytail just so I can see it it kind of
looks like almost like an Auburn color
Auburn mixed blonde color I was looking
at I don't have my lenses on right now
so I was looking at it I don't got my
clear contacts on right now I need to
get new ones
but yeah so I will clean it kind of
looks like an Auburn color in a way so
yeah like an Auburn blonde mix or
whatever not I don't know if the company
named it that but I will link it down
below for you guys you guys know so I'm
just wiping this off right here guys bad
okay so now that I've wiped mostly all
the white flake let's see right here
alright so and if you see something like
little white patches it's probably just
from the piece of paper that I just use
I should have used a white but I use a
paper instead so I'm just gonna ball
this up like this for a minute while I
should just finished doing the rest of
this so it'll probably end up being of
the hairstyle like that but we'll just
fix it up and the back is actually
pretty flat too so I'll show you guys
all the parts of it around so what I'm
gonna do now is break the cast of the
baby here especially this where I hands
a little too perfect when I just don't I
just wanted to look kind of like natural
baby here it's not too like stuck down
but got to be Ghul is very thick so it
kind of gives it
more like that's that uh kind of real
gel like looking up sometimes I don't
like that so I like to break the cast
before I add the powder I'll loosen it
up a little bit as long as well with
this one right here too but this one I
like it cuz it goes straight into the
pony to the bun so I like that about
that one I'm gonna break the cast off
with this one too and you'll get like
some more flakiness when you break the
cast so I'll just go in with the little
piece of paper again and just kind of
clean it up but yeah so that's that one
and then that one I broke already so uh
yeah so that's about it so what I'm
gonna do now is use my BH Cosmetics
contour powder palette and I'm just
gonna go in and just basically like
shade in the areas where I have some
open edge right here and I do this like
after I put the wig on because I feel
like I have a better view of it and I
can really get it to match my skin now I
know some people do before they put the
wig on but this is just the way I do it
I'll probably try to start learning or
trying to change it up and do the way
that other people do just as a test or a
trial but for now this is the way that
I've been doing I put the powder on the
lace once it's on my head so I'm gonna
start that and we're gonna actually
fast-forward that part because you guys
seen that a lot of my videos so I'm just
gonna add it on all the open it you're
gonna see how much it kind of brightens
up and opens up and looks more realistic
so I'll be right back
alright guys so this is what the sides
look like and I hope that this is not
guys this is just what it looks like
from my camera I know someone asked me
if I put like a filter or something on
my camera honestly enjoy about this
camera about like about like four years
ago and I never really knew how to do
the settings on here and all that sounds
really stupid but I'm not gonna lie I
really didn't know how to play around
the setting so this one I believe is on
auto there's a little crown thing there
I should take a picture of what the
settings look like it says I asked Oh
auto auto and I don't think I added any
filters to it so it's showing you what
it is like realistically I I will
actually link that down I'll put in the
video somewhere so I'll tell you guys
exactly the settings on this camera but
I'm pretty sure that it's only on auto
so I'm not adding a soft filter on it so
that you guys can't see the natural real
rawness even if you guys watch some of
my vlog videos like when I don't have
makeup on or even in the beginning this
video with no makeup on anything that's
just what I look like so I hope that
it's actually not giving like a fake set
right now so I'm gonna come up with
close to possible so you guys can see
the hairline there are some little
crusty edges what I usually like to do
with this is if I find like a little
crust spots from the got to be glue I
simply just pick it off of it off my
skin and you'll get like little flaky
parts so you'll get like a little flaky
area like I just pulled off right there
so I'm gonna show you guys up close what
it looks like and obviously there's
still some flaky and this to it but like
if you're doing wind you're not gonna
just put the wig on and then just walk
off the house so I don't want anyone to
think like you're just gonna put a wig
on and just like do that okay I'm out of
here I'm just gonna put my wig on and
balance so it doesn't work that way like
this is actually a process so I don't
like your friends to see this way so
this is lifting a little bit I'm not
gonna actually touch this because once a
headscarf hits it it'll be fine
so those parts I don't even bother with
because a headscarf will help like lower
those parts down so I do have some
crustiness right here that I'm just
gonna pull off okay
but I didn't after I added the powder
you can see right here it looks really
good right here looks really good it
looks like a nice open image to move the
baby here it's nice and open so I hope
you guys can see that I hope the filter
or whatever the camera's not giving you
guys like some false look so that's what
the hair looks line looks like and
that's how I like it so what I'm gonna
do now is probably try to style it for
you guys so that you guys can get like a
better view of what it looks like so I'm
just gonna style it I'm going to fast
forward styling it and I will be right
back guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
