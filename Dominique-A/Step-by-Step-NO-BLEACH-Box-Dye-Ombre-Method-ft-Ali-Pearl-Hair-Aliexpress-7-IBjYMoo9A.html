today was use box dive from dark and
lovely and I used two of the 396 one is
blonde in the 379 and the beige one I
believe it is now I'm going to us
through these hearing guys to kind of
afraid we're gonna my gosh my hair now I
only got the 379 just an astronaut a
little bit just because it's an ash told
the other to do color go to feature
powder anymore like a little powder that
you make something developer so that's
the reason why the hair will pick up a
better color I'm really excited about
this because I just want to see what
kind of color acting yeah it's not going
to be super into the blood if you want
to you can go in with some bleach and
just do some highlights which I'll
probably do at the end but for now this
is a method of many years I'm gonna see
in the words and if this works I'm
probably use this method often just
because when you bleach your hair it
just definitely takes a lot of the life
out of the hair and this process does
not harm the air at all
all right guys so I'm gonna take my time
to do this just so I could show you guys
exactly what I do it so there really
isn't a method to my madness
I just really and honestly and truly
just go on this sporadically and put the
hair dye on I did get to the blog's that
match and then one that's just kind of
an ash color with that hair dye I'm just
gonna drop that all over it just to kind
of give a little bit more of a cool tone
you guys will see obviously in the
beginning so if the hair looks like it
just the column looks really good like
it's not too strong it's not too brassy
and it's not - yup so I really do like
the color and honestly you don't have to
bleach the air right developer powder
and all that kind of stuff I use box
start to achieve this covenant in the
cause very nice if you want to go back
in with some bleach and kind of put some
highlights in it which I'm probably
gonna do just to give myself more of a
command look I just think that this hair
entirely came out pretty nice and as you
can see I'm just putting the dye all
over there's no method to it I went
there cardigan nothing like that I just
left some of the black roots available
and they're just dye the racks I'm gonna
do that along with the bundles to talk
to and I'm not cutting the bundles hope
and I want to go this way so I can be
more dimension to it and I did this is
gonna work guys some more little expect
options
so this is the final look of the hair I
received from ally pearl here now I did
go in and color it and I showed you guys
in the beginning of the video I kind of
talked through on the hair dyes that I
use and everything you guys asked me
often to kind of show you guys how I dye
my unit so I wanted to show you guys how
I did that
now this hair was completely dyed using
box dye and I'm actually really pleased
to actual results I actually wanted it
to be a little bit more blond than this
but I can always go in with a little bit
of bleach and add some highlights and if
I want to some dimensions of of this
unit is kind of lighter than most parts
like in the front and you'll see like a
little bit of light kind of blond spots
but overall it's kind of like a nice
light brown or like kind of like a dark
blonde ombre style unit I absolutely
really really love this unit guys it has
like a really nice fluff to it which oh
my god just spit Wow
so then here has like a really nice
fluff to it and after I watched in the
kind of I watched it twice and a lot of
air dried twice just because I really
wanted to here to have like a
personality so the hair is body wave
texture so you do get a lot of kind of
lift on this hair and a kind of like a
buff volume style I did blow my curling
iron it just put some curls in it I felt
like the closure just didn't really want
to hold the curls as much as a bundle
Herenton
but I manipulated that using some
hairspray and actually worked out pretty
fine I didn't do it I didn't do like
crazy baby hairs with this hair just
because I like how that here is the
frontal is it's kind of like really kind
of like free parting like when I mean
free parting is like really really free
parting so I can just kind of do flip
over method with this one and it looks
like it's kind of like growing out of my
head so it definitely has kind of like
one of those effects where you can just
do a lot with the frontal and if you
know
I mean leave your comments down below so
I just decided to do a side curve part
and then just kind of like throw it over
like this to kind of have like a kind of
natural kind of front look instead of
having like all this baby hair magic and
flattening it out cuz I wanted it to
have like a little bit of a lift in the
front so it kind of looked more glam and
more kind of like ready for New Year's
kind of like holidays styled um unit so
guys I really do like this I will leave
all the information down below if you're
interested in purchasing this hair from
this company like I said I did make this
unit myself custom it is on a mesh dome
cap so it's not gonna come to you like
this you have to create your own unit or
do a sew-in or whatever you want but I
do like this hair guys I think it's very
pretty
it's about 20 inches long so it stops
like just like where my boobs are at
it's not a bird uber long so that's one
thing I actually really like because
it's shorter it has more volume and it
looks really really glam and really
really pretty
so guys like I said I'll leave all the
information down below for you guys you
guys are interested in purchasing this
hair from this company do not forget
