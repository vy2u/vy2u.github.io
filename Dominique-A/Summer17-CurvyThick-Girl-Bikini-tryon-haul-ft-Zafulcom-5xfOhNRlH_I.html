with another curvy girl plastic girl
trying hall now in today's China I'll be
showing you guys in swimsuits from
zappos.com everything will be linked
down below for you guys if you guys are
interested in the products now don't
forget to like this video also leave
your comments down below and hit that
subscribe button and I want you to stay
tuned and keep on why right thing I'm
going to start off with with the
one-pieces that I got now the one pieces
that I've selected are all black which
is I don't know I just didn't pay
attention to what I was picking them out
so they're all black but they're cute
though now the person I'm going to show
you guys is one that everyone has been
actually trending a lot of people who
have done reviews for example has
actually bought picked this one out as
well so I went and picked it out because
I want you guys to see what it looks
like on my body type especially for my
thicker girls out there who are kind of
skeptical of stuff so this is the
swimsuit that I picked out now this is
the one with the mesh panels and the
mesh panel and it also has this floral
pattern to kind of hot cover the nipple
area one thing I would say about this
one is that if you have bigger bigger
boobs than a D that's like the smallest
D cup I would just recommend not like
getting this just because if you know
you have large boobs going to be kind of
hard to get to the nipple part or if you
have larger areolas but this would be
perfectly fine it is a really flattering
string to it does have a low back area I
got this one out in a size extra large
and I think it was good I feel like it's
a size down so if you worry about the
same size you deficit size down to a
size large but this is really cute you
definitely can wear this as a bodysuit
with jeans if you're going out I
probably won't do that because I'm too
some of them might taste too much and
like outerwear so I don't know I just I
would wear this as a swimsuit
personally only but yeah so the next
thing that I got is another black one
obviously now this is a one-piece and
it's kind of like a velvet crushed
velvet up swimsuit now this one is
really cute because it has mesh paneling
on the sides right here which gives a
lot of sex appeal so I picked this one
on the size extra large as well now this
one's cute if you have smaller boobs
this says you have two cups in it I'll
give you a little bit of a boost in your
boobage area and if you have larger
boobs and your nipples are always hard
like mine this really does cover
the nipples exposure so you do have some
coverage I think this is Q if you have a
larger block as well that's almost kind
of like dig into your butt a little bit
so if you're around caves and stuff like
that you don't want to show too much as
be worried about the swimsuit it does
write a bit high and one thing about the
swimsuit is that the ones that I picked
some of them they are kind of like high
crotch I mean when you call it long
other videos you call inserted somewhere
so my fat pockets show on the side but
I'm really calm I'm like I'm comfortable
I'm confident enough but I really don't
care like I've been telling you guys so
my fat pockets are exposed like right in
the groin area but I don't care like
whatever cycle cares you know do what
you want to do now the next mating suit
I have is there's also another black one
now this is a it's really cute this one
has actually like a little design on it
sounds like the crisscross parts on both
sides of the the body that outside and
this one is more of a high def limit
it's a high leg so this one is more high
leg now this one's definitely cuts you
in the back of the thong so I would
definitely wear this to like maybe look
and then all adult exclusive resort or
you know just somewhere that's not a lot
expose your kid but it is high up in the
butt here and I'm going to show you guys
what it looks like because that's what
the whole entire video is for so if
you're offended by the by my body I'm
sorry but this is really cute guys I
think that it's good and also have the
padding and the breast part to cover
conceal whatever you have or enhance it
so I thought this was definitely a good
swim neck swimsuit I guys it's ultra
cute army fatigue swimsuit
this is high-waisted and it's really
cute it does have it kind of has like a
choker style hook line for the neck I
thought that this was really cute I got
this in a size extra large as well most
of the switches that I picked out are
all extra large the bottoms are high
waisted and the bottoms are extra large
but the thing the bottoms could have
been sized down to large
they do have kind of like a adjustable
area on the side where you can just kind
of like make it smaller so I definitely
got a large in the bottoms and then the
I kind of got a larger the top and
bottom but you know just for comfort I
think extra large works perfect and
these are really cute trunks and is a
really cute style army fatigues
now the next things that I got very fun
guys is very colorful now this is
totally like an aspect
type of swimsuit and it's high-waisted
in at a tide leg so highlighted meaning
that it cuts you really really high up
in the crotch area if you're not
comfortable with your fat pockets in
that area then I recommend not wearing
it but honestly guys who cares about
stuff like that so I'm definitely aware
this is my fat pocket exposure I don't
care but I think this is really cute the
pattern is very nice and the colors are
vibrant
I'm definitely wear this to Mexico guys
the top is even cuter guys the top is
kind of like a t-shirt top but it has
mesh paneling on it it comes in like
this little accent zip in the back right
here and it's basically mesh paneling
and this is the swimsuit pattern that
max at the bottom I think that this is
so cute it looks like it kind of look
like you were like a scuba diver or
whatever and I just thought it went well
together so I definitely think that went
out because I was like and that's really
the next two bases that are kind of like
in the same theme they're like an ass
techie kind of a floral tropical theme
so I kind of wanted to show you guys
them together now this one is on like
every website I swear and it's like one
of those padded hide it up bathing suits
you know what I mean cup size business
cup basis bra style so this is like on
every website and I definitely really
always wanted to get one somewhere for
all definitely features this one on
their website but I never got it now
this is a size extra large it does have
a padded cup size in there and it comes
with these ultra high waisted bottoms
there's only full coverage bottom so it
really sucks and socks and does
everything you needed to do this is a
really pretty pattern I'm going away you
guys know so I'm definitely going to
take advantage of wearing these tropical
patterns out to these tropical places
that I'm going so I definitely want to
pick this up just because I thought it
was cute colors go well and it just
looks fabulous now the next one I got is
cute it's kind of like a peacock design
it's supposed to be like two peacocks
joining in together the trunks are
really are like those guys they're
really really like the trunks are
high-waisted as well and you do get full
coverage of the trunks I think that
these are so cute the coloring is what
really drew me to it because they're
kind of like an orange pattern and
purple pattern and black away and it's
just so cute the top comes kind of like
a t-shirt style it does have sleeves on
I do not like the shirt the swimsuit
with the sleeves it just looks really
Kitty and
little happy-go-lucky top so I don't
like the sleeves too much but I do just
wear the sleeves down and where does the
halter and basically what happens is it
turns into 2p cups staring at each other
but I think it's so cute especially if
you're going to really tropical places
in the summer you want to kind of have
that tropical feel that tropical look
the nuisances actually look really
really good guys oh my god but yeah so
that's like really tropical guys we're
going for a tropical look I definitely
say bathing suits that I'm going to show
you guys this one being you know these
two were kind of like the if you won for
me now I'm going to start off with the
one I definitely cannot even try on for
you guys because it just was absolutely
way too tight now this one is this cute
little cage style bathing suit it does
have kind of like a choker style neck
which is really really cute and cool
this is basically somewhat of what it
looks like it's like a cage style swim
suit but the thing about this one is the
trunk and this is the only one that I
got in the size large so boy like I
already knew like that's just like like
it had to be the one that I got a size
large that did not fit so yeah so this
is what the trunks look like guys are
really really skimpy wait am i holding
the shit the right way no I was alone to
the right way should okay they're held
like this Zoe okay so they're like this
and they're so tiring here I was even
thinking about cutting this and making
like an extender so that I actually
could fit it just basically looked like
I had a muffin top in these and I was
like No
so what I'm going to do with this
swimsuit and it's really cute don't get
me wrong but it just did it work for me
and I'm going to give this away to what
do you guys so what I'm going to do is
just have a little giveaway so one
person will win this swimsuit for me I
will ship it out and everything for you
all you have to do is just go down below
and leave a number for me and I'm just
going to pick off the number the correct
number that I have in my mind 1 through
100 so you just got to basically pick
out a number put the number down you
could even leave a comment for the
number down in parentheses at the end of
your comment or whatever and I'm going
to just pick the number randomly and
then that person will win the swimsuit
and I will send it to you free of charge
and all that kind of stuff
so don't worry about that now this is a
size large so if you
are kind of less hippie than i am and
less like you got a flatter tummy than i
do then this will fit it definitely is
cute and i will leave the links for
these down below so you can see exactly
what this little suit looks like I can
put a star next to it so you guys know
exactly which when I'm giving away but I
would definitely give this away to one
of you guys so that you guys can wear it
to summer now the last ones that I have
is it was kind of like whatever with
this one I actually liked it I didn't
like it with the strap so I just opted
to pull those damn straps up in just a
socket so this one's cute guys it's just
I wanted to pick something that was just
kind of like boring you know like not
boring just something that just didn't
didn't like go too crazy you don't I'm
saying so I picked this one right here
it's like an orange oh god the delay Wow
the lights on so this is kind of like an
orange II pattern red blues kind of like
a mixed pattern swimsuit and did come
with shots what I opted not to wear the
straps obviously one shop is still
hanging on it I'm just going to wear
this without a strap and just hope that
my nipple or my boob doesn't come out my
sister's like that you cannot wear that
like that but I'm going to attempt to
wear like that just because I like the
pattern the bottoms are actually pretty
secure too and you know it's funny guys
this is actually a size extra large in
the bottom we're tighter than any of the
other swimsuits that I got so but the
good thing about these the fact that
they're tight they really do suck you in
and hold you tight so if you were
looking for something that's gonna you
win this is definitely going to work but
overall this was just something I would
just wear if I like we're going to play
in the player as well family New York
Connecticut New York New York City not
playing late I mean I go out go into
like Six Flags or whatever I just put
this on if I can wear one of them bad
bitch basics like I'm just going to wear
one of these to Six Flags so this going
to be my Six Flags and soon but yeah so
it is what it is with this one and
