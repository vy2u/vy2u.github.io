so welcome back to another with
Wednesday so the wait um review is this
wig on my head right now now if you
watch a little bit of clips in the
beginning I talked about the hair a
little bit so this hair is from RPG show
here calm now
this is the first time I've been where
I've worked with them and I absolutely
love their units guys on this one in
particular is absolutely gorgeous
so this time wanted to show guys can
color in my video I've done Grant ombre
hair before but I just want to show you
guys the pre-made wig that's a great
ombre now this one is a bob style so
it's cut asymmetrical usually like my
being on the other side but they
customize it to this side which is OK I
actually like how it goes as long as I
have a cascading bang like this I really
don't care I think that this one is
really nice consciously to do color it
is kind of aggravate customize it to a
great ombre obviously you'll still see
some pensive blonde around it and stuff
like that but I actually think it looks
cute and it kind of doesn't make it look
so so perfect and so so fake so I think
this goes very well it's like it's kind
of like a mixed length feels like eight
or ten inches and then twelve working
here in the front so I'm going to turn
around and show you guys with the wigs
back in the back
so I really really like this hair guys I
will leave all the information down
below for you guys you guys are
interested in this unit if there is a
coupon code for this unit I will leave
it down below as well and all the wet
the website and everything that you need
to know you guys keep asking me about
wigs selling my wigs which sells and
stuff like that I will leave it at that
we'll leave soon I would tell you like
them do a wig sale so you guys will know
that and up-and-comers with Wednesday so
don't worry about that as far as this
unit goes I probably will saw this one
maybe I'm not sure if it's windy find my
wig sale but I really like it so far
and it is a perfect width for the summer
time in springtime it definitely can it
could be a bad one for the summer so and
if you haven't realized a lot of color
here they're coming back in trend so I
do have some more videos for you guys
