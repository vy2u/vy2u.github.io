so today's gonna be a hair of you and
this here our view is on a synthetic
unit I'm starting to do a lot of wig
reviews now just because I want to try
different things out for my channel so
the wit I'm doing is the ultra lace
front wig and this is the bad guy bundle
haired wig and this is style Peruvian
and this is an El part lace wig and it's
in the color 1b so this is what the
package looks like and I would say I
ripped everything out the pack already
this is obviously what the hair looks
like guys as you guys may know so I'm
going to try testing out these hair
reviews on my channel just so I can give
you guys something more affordable to
purchase versus buying all that kind of
expensive virgin here whatever these are
kind of already priests out synthetic
wigs so therefore you don't have to wet
the hair to make a curl it's already pre
curled which makes it easier because
you're only paying like twenty two
dollars I did order this wig off of
Sam's Beauty calm so if you're
interested in this way I will leave down
the link down below so this is what the
parting space looks like guys it's like
a nice L part I will probably have to
add some pressed powder in it to kind of
bring the part to life but the texture
the hair is very nice and it looks
really summery it could even be like
kind of like a transitioning kind of
hair style so I does have adjustable
straps in the back and has one plum in
the back and it also has two combs on
the side as well so it's where the Klose
so it's too close on the side as well so
it's pretty durable and it's probably
kind of work really well when you're
trying to get it to stay I have a very
small head so I will be adjusting these
straps to my liking before I put it on
because my head is very dinky dinky it
does have a lace around the perimeter
but the lace is very very rough and I
don't think this unit comes baby here so
we'll just be rocking it the usual way
so let's just try to put this on just to
see so I'm not really I'm not really a
fan of parts on this side of my head
just because I feel like I look better
with parts on this side going this way
yet that way but it is what it is I'm
going to test this one out like that so
this is what it looks like when we just
popping it on my head with a freaking
lay still attached to it so while the
curls are really really nice guys very
very soft hair so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go and cut the lace off
and then add some press powder at the
part to make it look more lively so stay
tuned and I'll be right
Oh
Oh
huh
so I guess until I applied the wig on I
cut the lace off and I also put a little
bit of pressed powder in the parting
space the parting space is good enough
to make it look realistic one thing I
noticed about the way that it feels kind
of funny is that right here at the
beginning they kind of layered off the
hair in the front so therefore you'll
get kind of like puffing up here
and then they'll get kind of length at
the bottom which is kind of funny so
probably what I would do with this one
is just tuck it behind my ear or put
like a cute little tie on it just to
make it look more like you but I think
the hair had the texture and everything
like that is really nice it looks
actually pretty realistic and that's one
thing I like about synthetic wigs
synthetic curly wigs they holds a really
nice shape and they look really really
natural even when the hair does get
nappy it still looks really good so I
would be able to rock this one out I
think that this one looks fabulous it is
flawless and it was only like $22 so how
can you be twenty two dollars off of a
wig like I said I probably wear this on
and off we're not sleeping this I'll put
this up at night time and then put on
the next day I don't recommend wearing
hair like this and like heavy wind just
because it will get really really not be
really really fast but I do do like
really really like this this curl
pattern in the style it's very
effortless and beachy looking why so um
yeah so make sure you thumbs up to the
