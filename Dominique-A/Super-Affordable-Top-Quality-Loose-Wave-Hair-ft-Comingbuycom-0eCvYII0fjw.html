with another hair review now this hair
review is brought to you guys from
coming by calm now this time that I have
is a loose wave textured hair it is a 24
inch 22 inch 20 inch and an 18 inch
frontal now this here is very gorgeous
guys that I've had this hair for a while
I just haven't had the opportunity to
style and wear it for you guys but today
was the perfect day to do it so the hair
is really pretty guys the frontal itself
is absolutely gorgeous I just kind of
like parted it and I just kind of wash
it and let it air dry this way so I
didn't kind of fixate apart I just it
just not even perfect it's just kind of
a loop part the frontal is pre plucked
so you don't really have to do anything
to the front of it it's already like
manipulated perfectly so that's a plus I
do really like the pattern of the hair
but I just feel like the frontal pattern
is a little bit more curly flash to
loose waves and the bundles the bundles
are a little bit more loose which is
really annoying to me so what I'm going
to do in this video is show you guys how
I manipulate the hair to match and I am
going to cut the hair but I want to show
you guys how long the hair is prior to
be cutting in and kind of manipulating
it to make it match and look beautiful
so this is how low my hair is and I kind
of feel like the length is really good
but it's just not full enough in the
back and this part is just so much
bigger than the bundles that elects kind
of uneven and funny so I'm going to try
to do something where I can make it look
more fun and cute I definitely love the
pattern and I definitely love the
realistic miss of the frontal so I'm
happy with that
so I'm just going to manipulate this to
kind of make it look better I'm probably
going to chop off a lot and I know you
guys know no matter you cut it on the
hair but this will actually benefit me
it was a look so yeah so the interesting
is seeing how this looks after I cut it
I want you to
let me go
we go we go
whoa we go I'm ready I'm ready now oh my
this is what the unit looks like in the
cut and everything I actually really
like it this way just because it's just
less here to deal with and it just kind
of looks really good I love this above
the breast cut that I've been doing
lately I just make it makes it the hair
like a little bit more sexier and cool
rather than having it really long in a
natural-looking
although I did look forward to it being
long but unfortunately the frontal
didn't match the texture of the bundles
and the bundles were too loose while the
closure was too and I did like to close
the frontal section more than I like the
loose waves texture which is weird
I consider this a loose wave slash curly
texture so I was able to put that in the
description but that doesn't matter the
hair is beautiful no matter what guys I
don't receive any tangling shedding or
any of that mess I cut it and that was
that and get like little snags of hair
coming off I just think this looks
really good if you do purchase here from
them and you want like you want a
similar look to this I would stick to
shorter length bundles about like 18
inches and then get a front up front so
that's about 16 so that you don't have
like too much of a variation in length
like I said I cut it defuse it and just
put a little bit of argan oil in it just
to keep it nice and moist and I just
think that it looks really good like I
said the frontal is probably the best
aspect of this hair the frontal is well
well created and the pre-flood frontal
is everything so I definitely like this
hair guys and I would recommend it to
you if you're trying to if you're like
on a budget and you don't want to spend
too much money on my virgin here because
a lot of these websites are really steep
this website itself doesn't have to
their prices aren't too bad so it's
definitely budget friendly for my girls
out there so don't forget guys two
