you now this here review and from an
Aliexpress based company and this
company is Miss hair virgin hair company
off the rally Express I will link it
down below by incorrectly said it or I'm
not accurate enough I would set one
frontal with three bundles I would send
a 20 inch Peruvian loose wave frontal
with 322 in Peruvian loose wave here so
school boys guys if I said that
correctly so like I said I've seen will
be bit link down below for you guys
so I have to work with Aliexpress based
companies too often I did one on the two
that are customized which is that like
soft brown color ash brown color unit so
this is my second goal run in a while
with an address based company so I'm
very pleased with the eteri guys this
here is kind of like a little place
flash curly texture the bundles are more
curlier than the actual closure the
frontal itself as you guys can see right
here it's more of a curly flash blue
suede texture what I had to do with the
frontal because the frontal didn't
really match the closure I'm just a
match the bundles once I actually had to
call wash in here is twist the closure
kind of do like a a nice twist twist out
on the frontal so that it could kind of
blend in with the bundles a little bit
but for this time around what I just did
was I co wash it and I actually like air
dry I actually let it air dry by itself
but I kind of like bundle the hair up
together like scrunch it together
and laid it on a towel so that all the
hair can like kind of scrunch up into
one pattern together so I found that
that method worked perfectly for this
unit and I did use all three bundles and
the frontal for this unit to achieve
this look I really like it's like a
really nice soft baby doll textured hair
speaking of soft the hair is absolutely
soft cards I really really really like
this hair and it looks really good like
I said the only thing that I see that
that sucks about is that the frontal
really match the hair as well as I like
it I would have opted to glue it down
but I'm saving this wig for my trips and
I wanted to preserve it a little bit so
don't get all tingly and nasty and gluey
so I did just clean it off and I removed
all that got to be glue off of it when
you can see the baby hands right here
you can really go absolutely him with
the baby hairs in the front and
obviously the parting is pretty good in
the clothes the front ah the parting is
actually really really good with this
unit I just did a high up down look with
this hand I really like this wait guys I
made it myself as you guys know and I
just think it looks flawless and pretty
perfect and for spring and summer time
and even winter blast where were they
kind of moving out of the season soon so
this would look really good in the
spring and summertime just really nice
curls soft curls and just a cute up down
here style would be perfect so I will
link down everything down below for you
guys in regards to this unit and the
hair obviously because the hair is the
main factor to this video the company is
a pretty good company I saw a lot of
reviews for this company and seems like
everyone practically enjoyed the hair
and I do enjoyed it here too only thing
about the hair is that like I said the
bun the frontal doesn't match the
bundles that great notice there's a lot
of a luxurious companies that is kind of
like a major thing unless you get
straight hair but what like the textured
pattern here that's already kinda like
steamed process it's hard for the
companies to match it precisely so
that's just something you have to deal
with you can manipulate the hair like I
did and just get it to match a decent
and again and I think that this match
pretty well so yeah make sure you thumbs
up this video guys leave your comments
down below and also subscribe if you
haven't and I will come back together to
be more vape and hair main and correct
me later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
