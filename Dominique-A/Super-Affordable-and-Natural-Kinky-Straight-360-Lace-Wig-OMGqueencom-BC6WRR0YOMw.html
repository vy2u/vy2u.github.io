hand I was sporting today guys is from
oMG clean hair calm so I'm really
excited about this one just because I
love this texture on this unit now
usually when I do that kinky kinky
straight textured hair I'll go and like
straighten the entire thing so you would
kind of like never see it's real real
quality in its look so what does seem at
this time I decided to do with
straighten kind of like the root part
which were the part was that the front
area and then a little bit into the
sections here I just straightened like
the actual base of the hair now I didn't
go on a straight my hair all the way out
just because I wanted to kind of leave
like this buff buff enos in it I do like
how it has like this really crinkle
texture and how the hair just looks like
you know you just got your hair
blow-dried and stuff like that so it
definitely has like this nice kind of
natural look so I definitely wanted to
keep this one like that so I can show
you guys exactly what it looks like when
you get a straight out the box now
obviously I did go in and tweeze the
hairline a little bit I did play with
the baby here it's because I wanted to
customize it so that I loved it more and
more so I definitely do like it now I
just lay the baby hair is done lightly
and just added some pot around the
perimeter and the parting space you get
about three to three-and-a-half inches
of parting space so it's a lot of
parting space so if you want to do like
little cute hairstyles in the unit you
definitely can I think a side part on
this baby looks really cute you can do a
middle part in the middle part actually
will look really really cute as well too
but you know me I play safe keep my
little side parts and how do i metal
part occasionally along the way but I
definitely think that this is really
nice guys look at how nicely texture
this unit is and it's definitely it's
the type of year that when I hear the
wind blows it you're just looking like
ultra-fab
so I definitely recommend gluing this
one down just because when you glue this
one down it really has like this
realistic effect to it and not really
jazzing up the baby hairs too much
because then I'll kind of throw the
whole texture off but just letting
they've done up properly enough so that
it kind of looks like it's going in and
looks like an actually be realistic hair
so I definitely like this guy's as far
as shedding
my god he's shedding from his hair so
far as far as tangling no tangling
either the hair is super super soft
super super delicate so you're not
dealing or men are like having to mesh
with a lot of rough hair here that's
gonna give you a hard hard time so it's
definitely easy to manage it's not
tangling not shedding none of that kind
of stuff which is great now I will leave
that information down below for you guys
you guys are interested in purchasing
this baby now this one is 18 inches I
wish I would have gotten like a 22 or 24
because I would have had like the
ultimate nubian feel I would have felt
really Nubian with it but I definitely
didn't think the 18 is good and if you
do decide to strain this out you
definitely would get about like a 20 to
22 inch just because the hair is a
little bit textured so once you pull the
texture out it'll straighten out and be
a little bit longer so guys do not
forget to thumbs up this video leave
your comments down below subscribe and
share this video with your friends and
family people and I will catch you guys
in a later one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
