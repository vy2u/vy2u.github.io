today with another wig review now
today's wig review is brought to you
guys from a company called Friday night
hair and they contacted me last week and
wanted me to do a wig review so I'm
coming today to give you guys that wig
review if you guys see in my recent
videos I've just featured a lot of
different units that are very
inexpensive this one is sponsored by
them my recent videos have not been
sponsored I've just been really getting
into showing you guys different
affordable units this unit is affordable
it is listed at 49:19 49.95 or something
like that and it is a beautiful style I
have seen a lot of reviews on YouTube on
these units from Friday night here so I
thought it was a good opportunity to
show you guys this unit as well
I will linked on everything for you guys
down below and this unit I often get
asked questions about where this unit is
from I do have a video for this unit I
will list the information down for that
video the link for that video and
information on this hair as well so I'm
just going to start by showing you guys
that the hair looks like I did pull out
the detail packet and everything um it's
basically a weighty styled unit and this
is the GSL 40 and it's a color number 1
B and this is your little info car that
they give you with the unit when you
actually get in the mail you can check
out their website they have a whole
bunch of synthetic units they also do
have human hair products as well if you
doesn't interested in human hair
products from the company as well so
this is what the units like it's about
20 to 22 inches long it might even
before of 24 inches long depending how
tall you are I was meant to two thousand
five four five four and a half inches
tall so um it'll probably hit me usually
wear on my 24 set which is right like
right above the belly button so I'm used
to that but this is a really nice thing
that guys I am going to cut the lace off
it does not I don't see baby ears on
this but um I think it does come at baby
ears but you guys know in all my videos
how I try my wing so to show you guys
how I do it from start to finish so you
guys will see everything and how I style
the unit there are other reviews on this
unit on youtube so if you're interested
in checking those out you can check
those out as well hope you guys enjoy
this video so stay tuned and keep on
watching
alright guys so basically this is the
unit that I'm showing you guys
now it has two cones in the front one
comb in the back and adjustable strap
this hair is a very nice unit guys I'm
just going to show you guys what it
looks like when I just pop it on my head
with the lace I do have a smaller size
head so I do have to adjust the straps
very tightly for this unit one thing I'm
going to say to guys in the beginning is
do not wear a light stocking cap because
it will look a mess and I didn't make
that mistake but I still rocked it so
just use a black stocking cap and then
just put some press powder on the lace
like I'm going to do right now you can
just use any pressed powder that you
have your favorite face powder it works
perfectly and I just basically kind of
brush it all over the lace part the lace
is about like a inch and a half it's not
that much parting space realistically
it's not like a regular closure size or
any other weight size but it works so
I'm going to cut the lace off and
basically at this where I cut the lace
up I'm just trying to adjust it nicely
like I said do not use a light stocking
cap just stick with a regular plain
black stocking cap it'll save the
trouble of trying to make it look
realistic is obviously right here it
looks up looks a hot mess but don't
worry I'm going to work it real quick so
nothing I can save up to here it's kind
of sick guys and that's the problem the
only problem I see the wig is very very
dense and the fact that a synthetic
causes too much of a conflict but I do
end up finding ways to wear it very nice
see like doing this flip over method I
think that this looks really sultry and
sexy I'm really into this type of look
and I know you guys peep that I'm
wearing the natural eyes today so those
great contacts are really hurting my
eyes so I switch over to my clear
contact lenses but the grey eyes will
make it apparent once in a while but
yeah I hope you guys like this unit and
stay tuned I got a little bit more for
you guys towards the end of this video
make sure you thumbs up this video also
leave all your comments down below share
this video and subscribe if you haven't
already thanks guys
alright guys so this is what the unit
looks like I just ended up just doing
like a hi little ponytail at the top of
the wig on top of my head on this with
this unit I do like it with the over but
go like this kind of with that kind of
like that umm flip over look but it just
is just not for me
um I think that the hair line on this is
really straightforward
I didn't add baby hairs into it just
because the wig is very very thick guys
so you don't really want to play too
much in the wig to kind of manipulate it
too much so I probably would just wear
it like this or iPad would just do that
flip thing I do need to go out and get
kind of like a Wacom because his hair is
very very dense as I got to see how long
it is guys it's about right below my
breast the hair is very long and it is
very very thick it's like really really
thick they're almost kind of like wanna
curls guys but it looks really pretty I
think it looks like really good with
this styled hoops I rarely wear hoops
but I just decided to win them today
with this flip just because I thought it
was like cute together but like I said
if I were you guys I would not play this
here too much because it does tangle and
it does shed and I'm not even sure why
is shedding like this because I just put
the wig on and just kind of like played
around with it just a little bit guys so
keep that in mind but if you're going
for a look like this it looks good very
natural girl you asked and stuff like
that so I would say okay for this but
when I purchased this with my with my
own money probably not but if you guys
are interested in wigs like this or
Styles like this where you could just
kind of like wear it and go this is a
wig for you guys I would not suggest
when this wig out in the wintertime when
it's willy windy outside cuz this will
just turn into a hot-ass mess but it
looks cute so yeah so if you're somebody
that's like wig savvy this is a wig for
you if you're a first-time wig buy or
first time wig where I wouldn't say buy
this because it would just be too much
for you to deal with but I'm wig savvy
so therefore I'm okay with this I will
rock this one um and I think it looks
good guys so yeah so make sure you
thumbs up this video leave all your
