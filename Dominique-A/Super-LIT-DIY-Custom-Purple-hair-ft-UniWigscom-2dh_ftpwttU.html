another with Wednesday video now on
today's video I'm going to show you guys
a wig from unit wigs calm now this wig
was platinum blonde but I asked you to
color this unit for this video so the
color I used for this video was a door
1:13 African violet now this is a really
really pretty purple color I use two
containers of the African violet on this
unit and I saturated the hair for about
30 minutes and after 30 minutes I
shampooed and wash their hair and
conditioned it and it came out perfect
now one thing I'm going to say is that I
did stay in the lace when I actually dye
the hair so if you know how to remove
the stains off the lace just leave that
down below for me this is a full lace
wig so you can part it all any type of
way that you want and you can do any
style that you want so that's an
a-plus-plus it does come with baby hair
around the perimeter and all that stuff
so it looks super super natural they did
add some wig clips in there for me so
I'm able to clip it all types of ways so
that it's not falling or sliding off my
head you guys already know that I add
elastic bands to all my units just for
extra security just because I have a
small head and it is kind of hard to
just and stuff on my head so I use
elastic band but to each his own so yeah
so if you're interested in seeing what
this unit looks like guys I would like
you to stay tuned if you like
guys I am totally totally stoked I'm
super super giddy inside and happy I
absolutely love this hair I majorly love
it because of the color and I'm not
gonna lie to you guys but what I am
going to say is that the wig texture and
quality is excellent now thank God I got
the sixty the 613 platinum blonde I
would not have gotten the color to be
this grave I didn't start with that
blonde some people have achieved it by
bleaching darker here and getting it but
I don't have one process to do and it
was boom so this is what the color looks
like guys it's almost kind of like a
blue / purple I don't know if when the
camera is coming off blue but it is kind
of blue purple oh my god I love it so
much
I did dive in with black I just kept it
straight colored but the fact of the
matter is that because it is a darker
purple you really don't have to dye the
roots to be honest because it kind of
gets dark in the dark at the root and
kind of goes out like I said before guys
I did current dye some of the lace so I
was trying to see if you guys can give
me some suggestions on how to revise it
and take the color out of the lace so
leave that down below for me other than
that I'm so stoked I love this hair and
it's going to be crazy hot for seven
summer seventeen like like I know girls
are walking out with colored hair but
like this is like this is sick right
here this is this is really sick and
like an ish use that gym I don't think
I'm going to walk out silent especially
when it comes to work but like I'm off
next weekend and I'm definitely going to
wear this way next weekend like I just
heard so nice guys I just like it it
looks so silky and pretty like I'm so
I'm so excited so yes so enough for the
enthusiasm I do want you guys to check
out anyways calm if you're trying to
customize your own ways I recommend
starting off with a six thirteen
platinum blonde color just because you
have more wiggle room to get exactly
what you want I got exactly what I
wanted with this way the combs and
everything the construction just
everything about it is a plus and adding
the color on has vamp the wig up to from
a ninety nine percent to 110 so I'm
really really excited
