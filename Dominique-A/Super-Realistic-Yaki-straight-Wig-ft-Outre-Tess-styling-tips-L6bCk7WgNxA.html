review now this wig review is on the old
tre test wig and I purchased this wig
off with Sam sweetie calm to review for
you guys this is more saw synthetic yaki
textured wig it's about 20 to 22 inches
long depending on how tall you are I am
5'4 and a half inches the width does
have three combs two combs in the front
one comb in the back and the Jaspal
strap I am just going to plop it on my
head with the lace on just to show you
guys what it looks like this is very
nice wait guys that love the texture the
texture the densities perfect I did not
receive any shedding or any tangling
from the hair but it is synthetic so do
expect some tangling to happen sooner or
later but for now this hair is giving me
life it's very deep it is and it's
really nice so I'm going to customize
the way by cutting some baby hairs
around the perimeters just a little of
two baby hairs and the good thing about
this hair is that the baby here is
actually stay flat because of the
texture I'm also going to go in with
some pressed powder and I'm going to use
my BH Cosmetics Pro um studio contour
kit and I'm going to use just some
regular face powder that matches my skin
complexion
I prefer powder over concealer like you
guys know because conceal is a little
bit messy the powder just kind of falls
into the part which makes it look really
really real so I'm going to show you
guys a couple ways I style the hair this
will be the first style is very basic
and then I will show you guys three
other styles that I incorporated it into
my look so stay tuned and keep on
watching guys I just stopped in the road
over
