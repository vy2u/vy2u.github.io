Wednesday so in today's video I'm
showing you guys a wig from a company
called China lace wigs calm now this
unit is the version Brazilian deep waves
a 360 wig now I would set a 22-inch in
this deep wave pattern and the hair is
so freakin cute so what I ended up doing
with this unit is customizing the unit
to a very nice burgundy cherry red color
now the hairdo that I used to get this
color was the L'Oreal techniques high
color now I got the color magenta and
highlighted version I'm gonna hope
that's going to focus in so I got
magenta in the highlighted version and
then I also got the Lauria excellent in
the high colors this is the one that's
actually the whole entire hair dye and
this is in the color 89 red hot so I mix
these two together with the 40 Barbie
developers to get this really nice kind
of cherry red book I only added the
magenta in there because it gives you
highlights but it kind of brings in like
really really bright color like a
brighter red color into the mix a little
bit so it brings out the red even more
so this is what the unit looks like guys
I'm really excited about this unit it
comes with three cones one at the base
one at the base and two on the sides
right here I did already add the elastic
band on it because I want my way to be
really secure it also comes with a
little comb in the back and an
adjustable strap in the back as well
like always ooh now obviously you guys
can tell that the hair do I believe it
to the lace this is a very very easy fix
guys all you have to do is just take
your press powder and powder the whole
entire lace part and you're good it will
seep right through and you'll be able to
see that you obviously have added the
powder and your party will look perfect
it does have baby hairs around the
perimeter and as you can tell it does
get a little bit of a first to it but
with curly hair I do like it to look
naturally big and free
be not really so much but the curls
define a little bit of spread because
the dr4 it looks a little bit more
natural instead of looking like they can
so I'm really excited about this guys it
is 22 inches long so it is a very long
curly unit obviously you can see the
color right now but when you go out into
the light or you're actually see it in
the light it's really bright and pretty
like I've never done red hair curly so
this is the first time I'm doing it
I'm usually I used to do like the
straight ones with a burgundy red color
but this is the first time doing curly I
want to see how it works out so yeah so
if you want to see what this unit looks
like I want to stay tuned keep on
watching
hi guys so this is basically what the
unit looks like let me first start off
by showing you guys how long we unit is
so so the unit is marked as 22 inches
long this is more so about like 20 to 24
it's a very very long unit the density
is actually really large density as well
so this hair it's really big it's not as
big but it does carry some density to it
which I like because you're not seeing a
lot of gapping in the back right here
which I freaking hate about wigs
especially curly wigs because curly wigs
you shouldn't see any spaces in the back
of your neck right here and if you wear
waves you know exactly what I'm talking
about but this unit is great I think the
coloring job came out good I only use
two boxes of hair dye with a 40 volume
developer and I think the color came out
justifiable I think it looks really good
and the light it does look a little bit
brighter so I hope you guys are seeing
like most of the color right now I try
to show you guys in all dimensions to
kind of give you guys a really good
impression of the color basically I just
added press powder on and I use mascara
to kind of give myself a little ombre
look just because it makes it look a
little bit better I did add some of the
got to do goo around the perimeter to
kind of play with my baby here a little
bit
as you know and I just think it looks
really really natural guys you can wear
this in a ponytail because it is a 360
wig and you guys see me wear buns and
stuff like that and ponytails in my
video so you guys know how 360s work
with this unit I'm probably not going to
wear it in a bun just because I think it
looks really good like straight down
like this and like to the side and stuff
I just think it looks really good like
this because of the length and the
pattern so I'll probably just be rocking
this like this but if you do like
ponytails or curling you're deep ways
here you are able to put this in a
ponytail so go for it I don't receive
any tangling and I don't receive any
shedding which is actually really
surprising on the tangling part because
this is curly here but I just have it
here for about two days now and I didn't
really play around with it and I
probably won't play around with it just
because I know it'll turn into disaster
so I'm going to leave it the way it is
and I can't stress about it
so chinam a tiny lace weight is actually
pretty good guys I'm very very pleased
with this unit the color and everything
about it has been an a-plus-plus so yes
