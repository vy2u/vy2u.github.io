today with another wig Wednesday video
nowadays but I'll be showing you here
here why do I keep saying it I'll be
showing you guys away from RPG here calm
now this is a 360 wig it is a body wave
texture and it is 18 inches long 150
percent density now if I forgot anything
for this video I will link it down below
as usual sometimes I'll put to be
continued or to be posted just because
I'm like an arrest what I'm trying to do
it but for the purpose of the video just
look down below I will post the links
and everything for this hair it's down
below now it is a natural color so it
doesn't get any better than this
you can dye and color these wigs if you
want to because it is 100% virgin human
hair now for this one I didn't leave it
in the body way of textures is because
body wave is not a real texture so when
you wet this up it's not going to go
back to that little s pattern that you
see when you first get the hair so what
I decided to do was just going with go
in with my do bowling thirty two
millimeter curling line and I just put
some curls in it now I think it looks
really really cute like this it did kind
of shrink the link the link a little bit
but I think it's going to look nice once
I finger comb it out but I will show you
guys how I do that once I've installed
the hair it does have good parting space
you get about four inches in the front
and about like two inches in the back
because it is a 360 wig now it is your
regular cap construction you get three
combs at the front one at the base two
on the sides as well as one in the back
of the adjustable strap now I usually do
like a small size cat because my head is
a bit smaller so on this one is actually
a well fit cap it does have a little bit
of stretch in it so if you do have a
bigger head and you're ordering it and
like the medium or large you will be
more than
lucky and you actually have a lot of
room so definitely I would recommend
sizing down a little bit on these so
yeah but like I say you can always
adjust it by adding an elastic band and
I'm also just adjusting the shaft
yourself so that's the plus plus I did
just take a little bit of the hairs out
of the parting space just because I just
thought it was a little bit thick what I
did notice with this one is they did pre
tweeze the front so you do have a really
good curvature on the hairline and it
looks perfect so guys if you're
interested in seeing what this unit
looks like on me today I would like you
to stay
Oh
alright guys so this is what the hair
looks like finalized and everything and
might I say I really really think that
this is plus plus and know you guys are
feeling me on this one this one looks
really cute now like I said I did go on
my curling one and I did put some curls
in it just to kind of give it a look a
little bit of a different look like I
said that old body wave as shape doesn't
last so I didn't want to give you guys
like false pretense like oh you know let
me just get this please because look at
how she worn that false body wave
texture so I want to show you guys this
potential with this wig so therefore you
can curl it you can strain it you can do
whatever you want cramp whatever your
heart desires the actual curling line
set looks actually really cute with this
one it is 18 inch so I do have it a
little bit shorter now so I think it
looks really good guys and I did like
play around the baby hands just a little
bit I added a little bit of dr. B blue
line but gawky the glue is really messy
so that's just it's kind of like up and
down with that type of situation but I
did try to add a little bit dr. B due to
it and as it is my base cosmetic contour
powder palette just to kind of slap the
powder on and I do fun types with the
powder around these parts - because
closer to the perimeter of the hair you
do get kind of like because they did pre
tweeze it so you'll get a little bit of
skin exposure from the lace so I do try
to powder that down so it doesn't look
so fake so that's why you see me
pottering around the edges sometimes
with my units but for this unit guys I
think that this is perfect
like I said it is an 18 inch long so
it's not too too long at all and touches
like right about there
Bert and I just think it looks really
good it's a very sexy and sultry and
because it's lightweight and it's not
long you can go out again on a nice hot
day or like summer day
not be too worried about your hair
touching your back or being a little bit
annoying look really really annoying
this is perfect hair for that so yeah so
make sure you guys leave your comments
down below don't forget to thumbs up
this video and subscribe if you have it
thank you for joining me today on
today's with Wednesday and I will catch
you guys later
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
