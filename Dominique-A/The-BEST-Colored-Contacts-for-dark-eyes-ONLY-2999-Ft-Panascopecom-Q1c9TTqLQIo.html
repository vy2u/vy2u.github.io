back today with another review but it's
not going to be a hair of you it's going
to be a contact lens review so you guys
have been asking me about my contact
lenses in my recent videos so the
contact lenses that I was wearing were
from a company called Panna scopes calm
now this is a canadian-based website so
make sure you check all the shipping
information if you're not from the
United States and if you're from the UK
or whatever because the shipping time is
going to be longer
now these contacts guys are excellent
now I'm have really sensitive eyes and
if you're like me you probably have a
lot of issues with your contacts being
rejected from your eyes I usually have
to put my clear contacts and a 3%
hydrogen peroxide cycle overnight but
with these contact lenses I took a
chance and I try them on the first time
with just normal saline and I had no
rejection with this one I had no idea he
would feel them they fit really nice
they were very comfortable and very
moist in my eyes so um and this is the
first time in a long time that I'm
wearing colored contacts so it was kind
of different I really wanted to try
color contacts but when I was doing my
research on companies the silica contact
lenses were really popular at the time
but they were really expensive
now silica contact lenses are $100 guys
these contact lenses from panis cope are
$29.99 $30 so it's almost 25% of the
price of it's like yeah it's like
three-quarters less the price of the
cylindrical contact lenses and these are
just as beautiful guys
so if you saw my Instagram you probably
saw me with the blue ones and then the
kind of like hazel ones so I'm gonna
show you both of those contact lenses
today I will insert a picture of the box
on the side for you guys can see how it
comes so the first color is marble gray
and the other one is Sierra brown these
contacts do not have a limbo ring around
them so therefore you're just gonna get
your it's just gonna look like a melting
your eyes really nicely so I just like
that because it gives you more of a
pixelated look like you look really cute
like it gives like a flirty kind of
Grilli look if you know what I mean guys
so I'm gonna show you guys how to put
the Sierra broad ones in first and then
I'll show you guys what they look like
side to side like would you guys think
about what you guys think looks nice I
actually think that both of them look
really
nice guys but if you're going for more
of a natural look to see her brown ones
deftly pull that natural look for a
woman of color and any woman but for my
skintone my race I think the Sierra
brown ones look really good and they
just look so natural so realistic so
guys I'm going to show you guys step by
step how I place my contacts in my eyes
I've been wearing contacts for 13 years
so I'm not new to this I'm true to this
but for some people who have never worn
contacts and are kind of freaked out
about touching your eyeballs I'm sorry
but if you want to learn I'm definitely
to show you guys how to put them in and
yeah so guys if you're interested in
seeing what these contacts looks like I
would like you to stay tuned and keep on
watching alright guys so I'm going to
start off with the Sierra Bar like I
said to you before make sure you guys
clean your hands before putting these
lenses on because anything any bacteria
on your hand you don't want that going
to eyes that's probably why sometimes
the contact lenses will reject and
that's mostly why hydrogen peroxide
solutions work really well for me
because they really clean off the lenses
and really really good so we're gonna
start off with the Sierra brown and I
have them in the case right here you do
get a case with each lens that you order
so it's that's really nice but make sure
you change your lenses every month you
don't want to keep the same dirty pace
just because bacteria can definitely
pick up in these cases so it'll cause
you you don't want to mess your eyes
honestly don't do that so make sure you
change out your cases every month now I
do use this sterile saline solution for
these lenses and this one is from Family
Dollar it was doubt I think was a dollar
at dollar 99 and this is really good as
well - this is what I use for the color
contacts I couldn't put them in the
hydrogen peroxide solution - but I don't
have issues with these rejecting my I
don't have issues with my eyes rejecting
me so I don't need to do that so I'm
gonna get the first lens out and my eyes
probably gonna water like crazy but I'm
gonna try to not have it water so we're
gonna try to do it nice so you want to
get at the tip of your hand your finger
like this and I put it on this one first
and then I transfer it to this because I
am righty so I need my right finger to
place the contact in and you want to
kind of get it like this on his backside
so I'm going to place this one to my
right eye now what I do is I usually
just lift the eye up when
make up on it a little bit more
difficult but I left the first slit up
and I left a lower lit up and I simply
just place it in my eyes so with this
one is trying to make my eyes water a
little bit I could already feel it
happening so I'm just gonna wipe a
little bit and I almost forgot I had a
nice little t-shirt here yeah so you're
definitely gonna get a little bit of
watering going on just because your eyes
trying to adjust you in the beginning so
just bear with it so just as an
excellent example you guys saw how my
eyes started watering when I crazy so I
was I ended up cleaning up real good I
had to fix my makeup but these are what
these contact lenses look like and these
are the seer Brown contacts so they do
feel a little bit funny but like I said
once you adjust your contacts your eyes
have adjusted they will come out and
they will be like really pretty so this
is what this one looks like it does not
have the limbal ring around it so these
are just basically like your it's your
iris and that's about it and just a
color on the outside these give you more
of a mystical like cute
I don't you guys know what I'm talking
about they look really realistic and
they do kind of have like this they do
look like the okra from some from silica
but these are so nice guys know limbal
ring and it just gives you more of the
sake kind of like pixelated girly look
and I think that these are really cute
guys and yeah so this is the first color
missus Sierra Brown so what do you guys
think about these so I'm going to
attempt again and show you guys what the
marbled grey ones look like I'm going to
show you guys how I put them in again so
this video is kind of like a child video
you know it is what it is your eyes are
definitely the water so I want to make
sure you guys know that like I said I've
been doing this for 13 years which eye
is gonna water initially when you put
that finger in there so that's just what
happened so guys just wait one second
alright guys so I'm going to try the
marble gray ones on again cuz the first
time I try the other ones on my are I
started going him
so we're gonna give this one at the tip
so this is the marble grain one it's
kind of like a weird color so it's
almost like a white so I'm gonna try
this one guys I've already cleaned it
off with some saline so I'm going to
open the top lid like this
lower the bottom and place the content
directly on the eyeball okay so this
one's watering a little bit less Oh so
this one's not that bad I'm just gonna
suck up the tears a little bit I like I
don't know what I do my tissue so let me
just get a tissue and clean this off
then I'm gonna put the other one on and
show you guys exactly what both look
like but that was really easy you guys
see how fast that wasn't easy so I'm
going to put the other one in and come
back and show you
you
alright guys so this basically wraps up
this video I hope you guys loved my try
on contact review today I was really
excited to do this video and I
definitely favored to see her brown
contacts more but you know I have to go
back to basics and I got my clear
contacts on now there's nothing wrong
