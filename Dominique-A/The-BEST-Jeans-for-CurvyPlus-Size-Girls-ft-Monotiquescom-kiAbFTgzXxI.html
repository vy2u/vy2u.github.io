with another Kirby slash the girl trying
out video so today's video guys is
sponsored by mono tix.com so I've
previously work with mono takes company
before so you guys are familiar with
those types of videos that I provide so
this is a clothing store and they do
provide like a lot of jeans now jeans
ranging from size 0 to 3x so if your
larger you're gonna fit jeans and if
you're small you're gonna fit some jeans
as well too so this website is wide
variety they do have mid jeans and they
also have high rise jeans so a lot of
the jeans I'm showing you guys today are
high rise I'm also gonna show you guys
some jeans shorts and a jean jacket so
it's kind of like a mix up type of video
so if you're interested in seeing what I
have to offer in today's Sean Haugh guys
I would like you to stay tuned and keep
on watching so these jeans right here
guys are really really nice I like these
a lot
they're a nice dark blue denim style
Jean and the best part of these jeans
guys that has this awesome split at the
kneecap area both of these jeans have
the same exact split on it it just looks
really nice these are size 15 guys and
these are the Aphrodite and
now if I would have got a size 1x I've
been kind of pissed off because they've
been a really big these size 15s are
super duper stretchy guys and if you
want to wear like body sister stuff
tucked in they would just look nice and
smooth you won't have to worry about any
ridging or anything like that I do like
these a lot
I could have definitely size down to
size 13 if I wanted them to be real
secure but the size 15 fits very good
and I just like the little cut in the
kneecaps is very simple and these are
ankle style jeans so they're not the
flares or anything crazy I do wish I
woulda got some flare jeans but they
were sold out but these are really nice
guys for just like simple outfits not no
distress whatsoever just plain easy
jeans to wear these jeans over here are
by far one of my favorite jeans I just
think the whole the whole part of these
jeans the whole look of these jeans are
really nice so they're super duper
distressed guys but the best part is the
ankle part the ankle part is distressed
all the way down and it's like a really
really tight ankle style Jean which I
absolutely love these are the type of
pants you can wear with heels wear with
sneakers and just be real swagged out
either way so casual and dressed up I
just think these jeans have a lot of
potential very nice they are high
waisted and super high waisted I have a
shorter torso so it kind of looks funny
and if you have like a shorter torso
with high waisted jeans in Gen
sometimes it just looks funny but I kind
of just roll with the punches it just
looks good on my frame so I just love
high-waisted jeans now these are very
guys these are my favorite these aren't
size 15 guys and these are a part of the
AP aphrodite jean company so basically
all the jeans are after night these
right here are just so these next jeans
that I'm going to show you are kind of
like ones that everyone has I have a
whole bunch of black pairs so I got
these aphrodite jeans in a size 13
they're kind of like Jagan's guys to be
honest with you they do have pockets in
the back but they do not have pockets in
the front I like these jeans a lot just
because they're very easy to wear
they're stretchy they make your butt
look amazing and it's just something so
simple to wear guys it is an army green
color I am an army green fanatic I love
everything like army green or some type
of green color khaki color whatever
those types of calls they just have a
lot of stuff like that
so I thought that these were really cute
guys they're very very stretchy so if
you are larger you can fit these these
do size up and they do go to 3x in the
plus-size section but like I said I
would recommend sizing down I usually
wear 15 in these types of jeans but this
one I got a size 13 it fits good and
does give you a little bit of a camel
toe
if you are camel toe ish but I do like
them about it out of 15 it'll been like
the same thing we'll just cut a little
bit different but I do think that these
are nice and they do look really really
good then I got that is also one of my
favorites is is distressed jean jacket
now I almost got this into what X
because I was afraid that my arms would
be too fat for it but this one fits
perfect that's actually a little bit big
but not too big this is a size large
guys and it's one of those longline
distressed jean jackets now this one is
probably the most distressed jean jacket
I've seen I never really had this much
distress on the back but I thought that
these were really cool it's a really
nice light feel it's not heavy too heavy
it just have cuff sleeves which i think
is really cute as well to the front of
the jacket is very nice very simple guys
it just has kind of like one of those
you can kind of see like a little bit of
a bleaching power like design on it
which is really cute but is very light
and subtle where it's not going to take
too much away from the jacket so I do
think that this is really nice guys size
large it is very nice
and it is also part of the AAP blue by
Aphrodite jeans collection I do like
this dress it's not too much it's
perfect and this jacket also has a
silhouette so it does give you like a
nice shape a nice French so the next
pair of jeans that I had guys in the
beginning when I got them I wasn't too
fond to them they just look kind of
funny to me they didn't have the look
that I wanted or was going for
they were very light when I saw them on
the website and I don't really wear life
cheese just because if my thighs look a
lot like it shows a lot of cottage
cheese ish and cellulite you know what I
mean so I didn't really want to pick
these up but I got them anyways they
were in the regular size section size 15
they are the Aphrodite jeans as well as
well - these are a bit bigger guys they
don't have pockets in the front the fake
pockets in the front but they do have
pockets in the back this one these types
of jeans give you a really nice
silhouette which is really why I like
them now this one does have cuts in the
kneecap area if you like that kind of
design I do like it just gives the pants
Alif like playing jeans it just gives it
like a little bit of a lift I'm sorry I
keep running in and out color Wow but I
do think these are very nice guys they
are super duper stretchy like I said I
size 15 you can go ahead and size your
regular size 1x or go down 15 will be
really nice and fit well it depends how
you're cut I think that this worked out
really well for me I think these are
really nice I want to wear this I
wouldn't wear this I wore this with
t-shirts and stuff like that just
because it's really light and I just
don't want to throw too much attention
to the actual Jean just because it's so
lightly alright guys so these jeans are
actually my favorite jeans and I know
it's black so it's kind of like she only
likes black jeans I think that's why I
like these jeans a lot guys just because
it fits superb ly like it really rounds
the curves out and really puts you in
like a right nice frame position I just
like the way the jeans are distressed my
favorite part about these jeans just
like my first one of the first keys I
showed you guys are my favorite is how
skinny the ankle is and it kind of has
like a little bit distress all the way
at the end of the ankle it's kind of
frayed I like these a lot guys because
these are the type of jeans you can
dress up or dress down which gives you a
broad fire via a priority a variety of
looks and stuff like that so I
definitely like this a lot the way to
cut the actual end of the pants so
that's just right then if I find pants
like that I just automatically buy it
because
when you put heels on my pants like this
it looks really good when you are
sneakers with these types of jeans it
just looks good now definitely frame
senior very nice what I notice about
these jeans is that it has like a
smaller waist and kind of goes into the
shape so the hip waist part is always
really tight and small now these are
size 15 and they are also from the after
that brand I definitely recommend you
guys purchase these distressed jeans
they're just amazing it's right here
guys are just one of my favorites from
this collection as well - no I did get
these from the plus-size section because
I was afraid that the regular size
section when it fit me but now that I
think about it and when I repurchase
something from this company I would
definitely get these in size 15 just
because the 1x was just a little bit big
on the waist now these distressed shorts
guys are super duper cute they are
distressed in the right areas right
where the cheek is right here and
they're all so distressed right in the
front not too close to the cooter but I
think that these are really nice they're
high waisted jeans shorts they do give
you a nice frame but for me like I said
I feel like the waist area was a little
bit too big so I could definitely put a
belt on it to kind of cinch it it a
little bit or I can kind of change up
like what I like you know like a top I
can wear like a loose top instead of
tucking it in or a bodysuit but I think
that these shorts are really really nice
or distressed perfectly they fit nice
but like I said because it's a little
bit looser at the waist I feel that I
can get away with the size 15 and the 15
would be fine but I'm always about being
comfortable I don't want to look like a
stuffed sausage so I do want to kind of
make sure I maintain and kind of hide
some of the spots that I don't really
like or the size that just need to be
fixed a little bit but I do think that
these jean shorts just I can already see
so many outfit ideas for the spring in
the summer with these shorts they are a
little bit you know risque just because
the back inwards cut out if you have a
bigger button big cheeks you will
definitely see the cheek edge on the
back so it's kind of one of those things
that you know you got to pick the right
place to go with it and you got to make
sure you wear it nice and tasteful but I
do think that these are so I featured
these shorts last time when I did my
trying haul but for some reason they
sent them to me again so I'm just gonna
show you guys what they look like again
now these are really nice shorts guys I
did not turn around in this video to
show you guys what they look like in the
back just because they are way too short
and
I honestly wore these to dream weekend
and I was getting touched a lot which
was crazy so I got these in a size extra
large and these are the after diaper and
I believe that extra-large size I picked
it on the regular size I'm not sure if
they have it in plus side I don't I
don't even know but check that out I
think they do have no plus size so these
are kind of like the really high high
thigh high but high cheek style shorts
now like I said I was wear these in an
appropriate place in appropriate setting
for this type of stuff do not just walk
out the house on a regular day
especially in Connecticut I don't think
I would oh no the people out here would
just be looking like oh my god you know
I would never do that in Connecticut but
these are the type of jeans I would say
to guys to just be mindful wearing
because some people get really offended
if you wear these day I definitely say
these are vacation shorts if you're
going to the island or something like
that they are super duper cheeky but
like all together in an outfit they do
look cute and they cut real high and
nice it almost looks like a cover for a
bathing suit so if you're going on like
a beach trip wear it on a beach trip
just because a little bit more safe but
I do think that they're cute they
definitely give you like a little bit of
a physique so I really like these a lot
and hey you don't have to be super
skinny to wear these and you don't have
to be you know like the perfect shape
you can wear them at any size so I
definitely recommend going on picking
these out no matter what size you are
guys I hope that this video is
satisfactory I do like the items that I
got like I honestly and truly really
really like the stuff now if it came
down to and I had to wear these jeans
because they're so high-waisted I
preferably say that it'd be better for
you to wear these with like body suits
or kind of like crop tops and stuff like
that just because I have a shorter torso
and some people don't have the longest
torso but I have kind of medium to short
torsos and when the pants come up
highlight that kind of looks a little
bit weird most of the times crop tops
will look weird but if you find like a
really short crop top that'll be really
cute with these jeans what I'm probably
gonna wear with most of these items guys
is probably like a bodysuit or tuck a
tank top in or something like that for
the summertime I do like all the styles
I think this time I picked out like the
styles that work on point there are a
few things that I just kind of was a
little bit weird about but once I kind
of figure it out I will get it right and
that will all be situated but other than
that guys I do like the stuff I think
they look nice and they definitely fit
the body like finding jeans to fit your
by
really hard if you have a bigger butt if
you have kind of a disproportionate type
of smaller top bigger hips bigger but
like flatter but whatever it is if you
have issues finding jeans and stuff like
that to fit you
definitely check out monetise comm they
do have a lot of selection of items from
mid rise to high rise jeans stretchy
jeans easy wear jeans just check out the
