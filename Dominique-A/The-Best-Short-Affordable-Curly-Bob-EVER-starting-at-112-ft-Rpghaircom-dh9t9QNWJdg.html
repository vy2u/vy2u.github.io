alright guys so this is the finished
look of this unit so I have reviewed
these like short kind of curly angled
bob style units before on my channel so
I want to come with one that's a little
bit more affordable for some people who
don't want to spend that much money now
this one did come from RPG here calm
guys and you know I love their units so
when they sent me this product I was
definitely very excited now I did um
coal wash not even co-wash I didn't call
wash the unit but I did go ahead and
wash the front of the unit because I got
something in it so this is a natural
curl pattern of the unit once you wet it
now it is almost the same well yeah it's
like basically the same as a packaging
curl this side right here is all
packaged curls side so you'll see kind
of how the actual curl is still like
intact and still nice and it's very
similar to the one that the side that I
actually wet so that's one thing that's
good about this unit once you wet its
gonna keep the same exact curl pattern
which is an a.1 now this here is the
curl pattern that I like to mention
that's the perfect curl so this is like
the real type of curly hair pattern like
it's like the soft curl it's really
light and delicate it doesn't really
have too much of a texture to it which I
like because this is the type of here
that if you just put a little bit of
product in it it'll just like be amazing
I did not put any products in this one
guys but you guys know I like to use
Mike and to leave-in conditioner if you
want to have like a style long day you
don't want phrase I do say that the
Cantu helps kind of minimize the frizz
and curly hair but because I'm not doing
that kind of stuff right now and I just
apply this wig on my head I decide to
leave it the way it was it not at any
products to it and I think that this
looks absolutely beautiful guys perfect
summertime springtime wig it's very
effortless this is pre pluck guys and if
you didn't notice I did not pluck any
hair off of this unit the only thing I
did to this unit was just cut the baby
hairs include the baby hairs down I
didn't even glue this wig down just
because the way fit very perfect I am a
medium cap size and this unit just was
it just is just everything about it is
just great now you can see that they did
pre plug very well like I said it was so
opened that I didn't even have to let go
like above and beyond like look at how
the hairline is around the perimeter
it's just so freakin good and like I
said I didn't have to glue this down it
lays down pretty flat and I did here's
my BH Cosmetics
contour palette - put the powder around
my perimeter sometimes if I notice
that's a little bit late I'll go back in
with the darker powder just to kind of
coat it a little bit so therefore I'm
not looking at kind of cray-cray but I
try to match it as close to my
foundation powder so that it looks like
it's actually my hair and I think that
this actually came out very very very
pretty I'm super super stuck about this
and I hope you guys actually go out and
purchase this just because like like
amazing like this is like a perfect like
look at that from the side guys perfect
curly bob unit alright guys so that
basically wraps up this video I hope you
