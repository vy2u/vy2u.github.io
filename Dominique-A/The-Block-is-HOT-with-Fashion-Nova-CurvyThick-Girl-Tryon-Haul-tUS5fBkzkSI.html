with another curvy slash sticker I'll
try in our video so today's video guys
is sponsored by fashion over comm so all
the items that I'm gonna show you guys
in this video will be listed down below
if you're interested now I did get a lot
of items from them a lot of trendy cool
pieces if you check out their website
they have new arrivals like all the time
and they're always on trend one thing I
want to specify in today's video that is
the clothing that I received guys is
definitely high quality clothing I
noticed that now the material is not as
thin it's a little bit more thicker and
they're using more cotton based
materials on their clothes I don't know
if it's just the items that I got or
maybe a lot of people have felt the same
way but they have been improving on
their material the material of their
clothes in general so I definitely have
noticed that in the last few times I
reviewed for them so I'm definitely
really excited about that I definitely
hate when you get kind of like a dress
or something and it's really thin and
see-through it just kind of ruins the
entire mood the entire look and time
everything so there's definitely been
improving on their material so that's
just an a-plus-plus now guys if you're
interested in seeing what I have to
offer in today's chart haul I would like
you to stay tuned and keep on Y so the
first thing I'm going to show you guys
is this really cute two-piece set now
link the name of this set in the video
it is a size extra large and it comes
with kind of like a legging style pants
and a little jacket now as far as the
pants goes guys this as far as the
entire go outfit goes guys it fits very
nicely it fits really good on the body
it is super stretchy and I definitely
love the paneling on the front right
here this white paneling on the front of
the pants eppley kind of accentuates
your body and gives you a nice curve I
thought that these were nice and they
weren't too see-through in the back one
thing I'm going to tell you guys is that
you definitely to cut off the tag
because if you don't cut off the tag
it's gonna show up on the back of your
um on your butt obviously so make sure
you cut the tag off before you wear it
other than that I think these are really
nice and sturdy and the bottoms are just
black and white the jacket is a little
zip up jacket you can either zip it up
or not I actually didn't sent myself
because I thought it was cute out the
zip I had like a little mini sports bra
underneath it that I thought just was
the cute because it was black and it
matched entire outfit so I left it like
that the jacket is in extra-large as
well to the cute part about the jacket
like guys is that the jacket has red
paneling on it along with the black and
white it just gives a great contrast
with the pants and it's not the type of
outfit to kind of throw you off I
personally would wear this with like
black and white sneakers or I even will
wear with like some red rotis because I
think that would look really cute but
this kind of red is a little bit hard to
match not a lot of red is like this so
you kind of have to hunt for that but I
definitely thought that this was a
freaking so cute and this is the type of
outfit I wore to the airport or if I'm
just going to run errands during the day
and I want to be extra cute but
comfortable at the same time I
definitely highly highly recommend you
get this I got my Zima size extra large
I know I can't fit a size large with the
extra large fit hurts so the next item I
got guys is this really cute jumpsuit
now this is the one I was talking about
the whole racetrack Drive your kind of
theme that they have going on so these
are really cute guys these are the kind
of like jumpsuits or onesies that you
jump into now it is legging style at the
end so it kind of cuts you at the ankle
so this one is called under construction
lounge jumpsuit so it's kind of like
more like like it says allowance or type
of suit so this is a size extra large
guys and the retail price for this one
is 32 99 I don't know if I'll be
spending 32 99 on this this is more like
a $19.99 outfit to me but I'm just being
cheap so this is what it looks like guys
I freaking love this so much the
material on this guy's it's kind of like
a soft it's almost like a polyester and
cotton mix if that sounds that sounds
right to you guys so it's kind of like a
polyester and cotton mix it's not too
shiny shiny silky kind of like that's
that squishy material it's really really
soft and it is kind of polyester ish
kind of look wise I absolutely love this
guys it has a nice fit on it I got an
extra large just a nice comfortable fit
it's not tight not sucking me in is that
sucking me up it has like blue contrast
on this one kind of similar to the
two-piece it does have the blue blocking
in the front right here when I was done
with the color blocking situation that
they have going on their website but it
has a blue right here it has a white
stripe and then it's just all black and
definitely accentuates the curves like
times 1000 I definitely think that any
plus-size any curvy girl can definitely
this off it's just really nice you're
definitely not gonna see too much nooks
and crannies and it's just because it's
black anyways the material is a little
bit light though so you will be able to
see anything that you have like if you
don't have like a thong on or a g-string
or whatever you want to call it you
definitely will be able to see any type
of undies in the back so I would say
wear something that's a little bit more
something that you want something
undetectable just because you'll be able
to see it but other than that guys I
didn't even have to wear a bra with it
it just fits so nice you could either
sip it all the way up or just do kind of
like a little bit of a chest exposure
trying to be sexy or whatever you want
to call it but I thought that this was
so cute guys and for $32.99 that's a
little expensive I would say $24.99
would be like the will be like the cut
off for me like okay is raised $25
that's good but um this is fashion OVA
what do you say now the next outfit that
I got it's pretty popular on the website
I've always wanted this now with this
one guys this is the one that I thought
was going to be super duper stretchy
like initially when I saw it on the
website and the girl that had on the
website it looked like it was like kind
of like stretchy see-through that it
almost wasn't gonna be the best quality
it kind of reminded me of like the novus
suit or like one of those kind of like
the jumpsuits that you would wear that
materials kind of like that really soft
cotton material this two-piece set has
like more of a structured material it
definitely doesn't have stretch to it so
if you're gonna shop for this one I got
my Zinna extra-large if you are bigger
than me I would say stay I would say
with this one stick to your size I
wouldn't say try to go down a size
because it's not gonna fit so this one
fit me good now one thing I noticed
about this one though is like the way it
cuts it's it's it's it's where it's high
waisted but the back I mean I guess if
you have a big butt it's gonna kind of
go down lower when I think about highway
said I think about high waisted meaning
high waisted in the front how it's in
the back this one kind of sits a little
bit lower than I expected to sit in the
back which is fine but I expect I wanted
it to sit like a little bit lower so
therefore I mean little higher so that
it just didn't show my tattoo or
anything like that so I just found that
a little bit annoying but I do like it
they do or they come above the knee
which is really nice and like I said
they're very sturdy so you don't have to
worry about like kind of pull these up
all all day long
that's just annoying as now the top
also is very secured too so if you have
a really large bus when I first
initially put this on I was thinking it
wasn't gonna fit me because like I just
know it's gonna fit me but I did put it
it does kind of squeeze your boobs a
little so like I said if you're someone
who is busty and they don't even sell
the items on fashion over like separate
pieces you have to get the whole entire
set as one size so if you're somebody
that's really busty I would probably say
not to get this and when I mean busty
I'm like I'm like 38d if you're like 38
double D F G whatever you want to call
it I don't recommend getting this
because it's just even if you're if your
bottom half is an extra large and you
have a big breast you're going to need
at least a 1 X in the top the top
deathly crunches you in so I would
definitely recommend probably not
purchasing this outfit if you are very
very busty like busty but I think it's a
cute set it's something like I said an
airport outfit something quick to put on
that's oh that's cute but it looks like
you're not trying too hard so I
definitely say check this one out guys
and I believe this one is it was pretty
inexpensive yes this was $24.99 guys and
this is called the bow dak biker shorts
a so this is really popular very
trending I know you guys have seen this
before so the next item guys I kind of
took a little bit of a risk with this
one and I just wanted to try it out
because I'm like you know what whatever
I saw it on the website I was like you
know I had a skirt that was a latex
skirt I got it from pretty little things
and I actually liked the latex look I'm
always the one to say first like I'm
gonna look like a stuffed sausage and I
would be I'm just like someone that's
really nervous and just doesn't like
stuff like that cuz I know for a fact
everyone's gonna be looking like bitch
what but you know what I decided to step
on my comfort zone and I picked this
dress out and boy is it nice so this
dress is $29.99 and I actually think
it's on sale on the website right now I
don't know why no one's getting it
because it's poppin' it's a size extra
large and this is called the kristen
latex dress now they do have these in
two other calls they have it in red and
they also have it in a nude color I
ended up getting the black color just
because I have a red skirt and have
other some other kind of latex stuff
that I have already so I was like you
know what let me just get
is black one so this is almost kind of
like a liquid dressed guys I thought
that this was really cute I'm going to
attempt to find somewhere to go to wear
this I I don't really don't know it has
to be like an event that's like some
type of like really you know poppin
event where there's gonna be people at
for me to wear this I wouldn't wear it
around here because there's nothing to
do but this is kind of like a nice dress
guys it has a low-cut in the front
definitely very boobalicious and
definitely bah-bah-bah delicious
it definitely snatches you on every
single surface I definitely like if
you're looking for something to be extra
sexy and you want to make a statement
piece here you go right here very nice
guys I know it's kind of weird because
it's almost like a really cheap thin
material and you wouldn't expect the
material to cost $30 but for the whole
concept of the dress the way they
constructed it it's very nice it has a
zip in the back guys so you can zip it
all the way to the back which will give
you a little bit more security it is a
little bit short guys it comes like a it
comes maybe like it's short it's just
short so I wouldn't say like bend down
in this one draw a lot of extra stuff
just really sit nice and tight at the
club with your legs like this and that's
about it or wherever you're going but I
definitely think that if you want to if
you want to try something different be
different and not care what anybody
thinks definitely take the risks with
this one I definitely think if I have
like some type of event to go to that's
a rule you know you know what type of it
I am I'm definitely aware this cuz I
definitely think that this look really
nice and I think I could pull it off I'm
pretty sure I could pull this off now
the next thing to show you guys is other
dress that I got and I absolutely love
is Jess guys it's very simple but
fashionable always finds a way to put a
little bit of sexy on stuff so this one
is called he loves my style dress oh
that's cute he loves my style dress oh
that's cute and this one's in Bergen in
a size extra large now this one is
listed for $32.99
so this one is actually pretty heavy ass
dress size it is sweater material but
it's surprisingly heavy I'm actually
surprised it can really come up with the
quality like this so this one is
definitely a 1 so it has like a little
bit of a wrap in the front which I like
you just tie it in the front I was kind
of having difficulty time in seden
office was being not over it supposed to
be 2 knots so I just tied
like twice and semi the second time
around but I think it's really nice guys
the one thing that fashionable always
does is they always have to add their
bit of sex appeal to it so what they
deal with this one guys they added a
slit on the side now I'm someone who has
some a bigger butt so when I walk my
dress lifts and I know you guys know
what I'm talking about you ladies out
there so if if you have like if you're a
little bit curvier sometimes the clothes
will rise up the curve so I had that
issue a lot with my body so if I wear
like a dress that's kind of like it's
not it doesn't have to be short many
dresses do that to me all the time as
well so it'll kind of rise up so instead
of the dress coming past the knee it'll
always be almost a you know above the
knee so that's the issue I saw with this
one because the slit is almost too long
it almost comes up a little too high to
make it just that inappropriate so I
definitely would say if I were if I were
no I would say in my case I'm probably
just gonna go in and risÃ¸ up a little
bit of the side just to close it a
little bit I just think it's a little
too long and too exposed and I just
don't you know I really want to wear
this why I don't want to wear and you
know how am I dressed going up and have
everything showing but I definitely
think it's a really nice sturdy dress
guys is very very pretty it does sound
like a little V in the front so you got
like a little bit of boob meat out but
it's nothing overly sexy overly crazy
it's definitely a nice kind of like
sophisticated dress definitely great for
the spring got fingered for the summer
guys I'm definitely in love with this
one so the next three things like I kind
of got like things to mix and match so
the first thing I got guys was this
bodysuit and I really thought that I was
looking at the body suits on the website
I thought that I saw a lot of them but I
thought that this was really cute I
definitely love that ribbed look with
the buttons and this actually comes in
two thong style which I thought was
perfect especially if you wearing skirts
and stuff like that you don't want that
kind of line in the back so this comes
with a thong style on the back and it
has like the ribbed rib material and
then these cute buttons which are not
false buttons they're real buttons and
the whole off the shoulder look and they
kind of have like a little bit of
curvature on the breast area I really
thought that this was really nice guys I
got this one in my size extra large and
it fit perfect this one is called full
in love
shoulders full and love off shoulder
yeah and this isn't the mustard color
guys I just thought it was really cute
so I picked this one now now the next
thing that I got are these really trendy
poppin shorts so just to let you guys
know when I buy my bottoms from fashion
over eye size 1x I don't buy the 15
because the 15 don't fit me so I always
get size 1x in my jeans and stuff from
fashion Nova let's hope I can lose like
20 pounds and I maybe could fit a size
15 fashion over but for now I'm doing
the 1 X's so I got these really cute um
kind of high-waisted shorts now these
ones like I said are size 1x and they're
called the vintage kind of vintage kind
of girl denim they always get me with
this you know so it says it's a medium
blue and then it says 32 I don't know
what 32 means maybe that's that's a size
32 maybe so this is what the jeans look
like guys they're super duper cute now
one thing about these jeans that I just
want to put out there they are very very
risque so I would say we're gonna wear
jeans like this I would say wear these
jeans if you're going away on vacation
to like a tropical island where it's
like acceptable to wear like little
shorts and stuff like that
I don't per say I would I don't
I personally because my my cheeks were
out I wouldn't wear this just like that
I would honestly tie something around my
waist to wear this
maybe that's why I'm an so I would tie
maybe like a plaid shirt or something on
my waist or like a little sweater just
because you're definitely gonna get a
lot of cheeks and a lot of stairs but
they're very nice jean shorts guys the
material is very stretchy it's like a
real it has that real denim feel not
that fake denim feel has a real denim
feel which I like a half's pockets in
the back and the pockets in the front
are real pockets as well too it has a
little bit of distress in it as well too
which I thought was really cute gave it
a little bit of character and I thought
these are really nice it does have the
the 1 2 3 4 or 5 it has the 5 buttons in
the front - I was gonna try to see quad
it has 5 buttons in the front - strap up
so I just thought these are really nice
and I'm happy I got him I've always
wanted to used to be honest with you now
the next thing I got are these really
trendy shorts guys
now these I really really like so these
are the camel style shorts now this one
does come with the white paneling on the
side they did have other ones as well
too and they just had different colors
so I just chose this one with the white
paneling if you go on the website you'll
find other ones they have the long ones
as well too but just keep in mind those
get sold out really really quick so I
was able to grab these and these are
super duper cute guys I the way I
started in the video is I paired off
with the screen tee and I thought the
screen team was cute rebel I would wear
that this entire outfit guys with like a
very colorful jacket like a blazer and
like sneakers
I just thought the outfit idea a whole
entire look was so cute in my hand I
really really like these pants guys
they're very comfortable there's their
size 1x they're supposed to be oversized
stuff
they're supposed to be oversized is what
they said which I mean I guess the
oversize not really they do have a lot
of room though so you can put your
pocket in it you can put your hand in
your pocket
they're very stretchy very nice guys and
I honestly very very well done
fashionable with this one you really
can't find pants like this like in a lot
of places are gonna fit and be nice but
for plus size very good fashion of them
so these are size 1x guys and they fit
perfect I definitely think that they are
there their trends are really good and
they're really nailing them a tear on
the hoenn they're executed they
executing they execute whatever they're
doing well alright guys so that
basically wraps up the video today I
really hope you guys enjoyed this trying

gums too much this time around mmm so
