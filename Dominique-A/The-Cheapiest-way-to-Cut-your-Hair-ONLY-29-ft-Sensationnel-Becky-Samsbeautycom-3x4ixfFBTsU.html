back today with another hair of you so
this tuna that I'm showing you guys
today is from sensational and I said
Empress lace wig now this does have
their lace front wig edge was basically
kind of like nice kind of like lace on
the edge in the perimeter it also is a
curved part unit guys and this one is
the style Becky it's a color 1b so I've
never really did kind of like a short
fun little blob like this before so I
decided to do it like for this video now
I really like this guy's this unit was
really inexpensive I think it was less
than $25 or less than $30 don't quote me
I'll leave the actual price in the video
now it is a nice kind of like feathered
style bob it does come with like a nice
front bang area and it is really short
around the outside the edges and
everything like that so what I did was
that went in and I put the wig on cut
the lace off I did go in and add some
baby hairs around the front perimeter
part and also added like a little bit of
baby here on the side right here it does
have a little bit of area so you can
tweeze if you want to
I didn't tweeze at this time just cuz I
wanted to leave it the way it was - guys
can see it up natural um I did go back
with my shaver and I just kind of shaved
some back hair just because I kind of
feel like the back was a little bit
bulky and it was undefined so I did go
in the back and just shave a little bit
of hair off the back and I did shave
some hair off the front part right here
just because it ended up being like all
the way down here and I didn't really
like how long it was but other than that
guys honestly Becky it's a really cute
hairstyle now I do have short hair but
my short hair used to be in the front
like this long but I cut it everything
off and started over again so it's not
as long so this unit right here kind of
reminds me of what my hair used to be
like but I actually really really like
this guy's it's really inexpensive it
definitely has a nice kind of like an
african-american texture to the hair so
it's not like super super shiny super
super silky
kind of synthetic hair it does have kind
of like a little bit of a Yacky texture
to it so it actually looks really nice I
did have my flat iron on 310 degrees and
I just kind of bumped the sides a little
bit
it didn't really bump too well so I'll
probably have to go in and bump it and
then spray it out and then comb it out
once it's like completely dried but it
does take heat it didn't melt or
anything like that so it does take heat
I believe up to 400 degrees but before
you do that just make sure you test it
out so therefore you're really not
running thing the strainer through the
hair and burning the hair so definitely
keep that in mind
other than that guys I didn't do
anything to the front bank part left the
way came I think this unit looks very
fun very actually realistic guys once
you kind of put the baby hairs a little
bit and really get it to be justifiably
like the way you like just kind of work
with it after that the bank is very nice
it's very feathered so it has like this
cascading effect that I really like and
I try to tell you guys in all my videos
I did add some powder around the
participate in the parting space and
around the perimeter just to kind of
bring more life to the way so guys I
will leave that information down below
for you guys you guys are interested in
this baby or any other baby from Sam's
