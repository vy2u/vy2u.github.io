look of this unit that was sent to me
from wall African comm I absolutely
loved this free will hairstyle right
here so this is their kind of like short
bob length messy loose wave type
textured wig so it did come loose weight
texture guys but what I do is that Co
washes hair let it air dry and then I
went in with my curling iron and did
some soft curls and then use my
straightener to straighten the hair at
the ends with hair that's this type of
link which is almost like a 12 inch
almost 14 it definitely gives you more
of a beachy spring summertime vibe when
it's kind of like messy this way now in
the video it's having a hard time with
the baby here is trying to construct
them well enough to get them to look
good with this I do like this here in
the middle part style you can definitely
do side parts and stuff like this
you get about five inches of parting
space if you do it in the middle part so
I took advantage of that when it came to
this unit now as far as the baby hairs
go I had to go with my tweezers and
remove the hair right in the front of
the wig just because it just didn't look
natural and it was just too thick and
too much in the front so I just pulled
the baby hairs out just to give me a
better effect when I do my bangs like
this so therefore it looks like it's
grown for my head it's just more
realistic and more natural-looking I
guess so I remove the baby hairs from
the front perimeter just to give him
more of an open look because they're pre
plucked that they've done on this wig
was perfect so therefore I really wanted
to emphasize that in the front I think
about actually glue this down it'll
probably be a little bit more
transparent because it is bleached but I
didn't glue this down this unit is
medium cap size guys and it fit my head
very very well um it does have combs in
the front but the combs in the front are
placed very strategic like their place
right here which is better than the ones
on the side I feel like the ones right
here really pull your hair out like your
edges out but the ones right here don't
really hurt you too much as long as you
grab the cap instead of really digging
into your hair but in my case I really
don't have that much here because I'm
really like a bald on the sides and a
little bit here at the top type of girl
so I mean it doesn't really hurt me but
I usually stick the combs in my cap so
these combs are
right here guys and there's one comb
right here this is like the perfect
placement so the cap construction is
excellent so guys I will linked on all
the information if you're interested in
purchasing this unit and what I mean
this is a complete unit guys it came pre
bleached people up perfect cap size it's
just like a complete wig so I will leave
