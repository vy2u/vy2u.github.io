of the hair so obviously in the
beginning of the video guys saw me
playing around with it what I did do for
this review this time is wet the hair
say guys can see what it looks like once
it's air dry so if you're not directly
going in Co watching this tape before
putting it on and you're just gonna go
on wet it I just use plain water and I
basically wet the hair as much as I
could and I'll let it air dry so this is
the dried out pattern of the hair and in
the beginning when I was wetting I
looked at the hair and I was like I
don't know if I'm gonna like it too much
it was kind of like kind of like a weird
ringlets style so after I let the air
air join I just kind of fluffed it out a
little bit in the front I noticed that I
actually really liked it it definitely
has a realistic african-american texture
and it's almost like a 3c if I'm not
mistaken with this it's a pretty nice
texture when it comes to kinky here now
it is definitely super buff guys I
believe this is 150% density but when it
comes to curly hair especially kinky
curly hair 150% density is just fine I
believe 200% densities 108 is just a
little bit of a stretch with this type
of hair just because it's already pretty
buff now um even if I put the hair to
the back guys it's big and even if I
transfer the hair to the front you'll
still get a lot of volume in the back
now this is a 360 wig guys so you guys
have the option of doing high buns high
ponytails or whatever and just hop great
amount of parting space in the front and
obviously I do like a little hair style
on the front to show you guys I did my
best to kind of clean it up and stuff
like that but I think that the hair
style came out pretty cute and pretty
decent you can't do like I said half-up
half-down you do have like about two
inches of parting space in the back
about 3.5 to 4 in the in the front which
is pretty much a very good area to do
what you need to do honestly and truly
as far as the powder that I use for the
parting space you guys asked me this all
the time and I tried to put it in the
video and sometimes I try to put it down
below but I forget so I use the BH
Cosmetics contour kit this is their
powder contour kit and I got the deepest
collection the darkest collection I
believe let's see yeah I got one of the
I guess there's only one there's 2
pounds but I got the darkest palette
obviously so this one I don't really
have that much left in this one because
I beat it up so much but I usually go
for the darker colors guys I've
because i'm brown skin so i usually go
for the dark colors if you don't have
this palette you don't need this palette
guys like you don't have to go out and
buy this just to get an achievable
powder in your parting space so don't
feel like you have to do that if you
have any type of face powder like your
foundation powder stuff like that you
can also use that one as the parting
powder as well too so do not go out just
because I'm showing you what I use and
go buy this because there's you can use
this regular powder so don't go spending
money you don't need to spend so um yeah
so that's what I use for it I didn't go
to natsound guys because it fit good
like I said I try to read out the
measurements for you guys sometimes I
think I believe this one is a 21.5 222
circumference so that's how big my head
is I usually adjust the straps anyway so
I usually put the straps adjust them all
the ways on both sides so that it can be
nice and snug I didn't have to glue this
one gotta oh it's pretty good I did use
a black got to be glue just to parent
the baby hairs in the front and that's
about it
as far as this hair as wearing it like
an everyday wig I'm not somebody that
would wear this every day guys just
because it's too big it's too much of a
hassle and I like to change my hair and
match my hair with my outfit so this
would just not work out for me anyways
but I think it's very cute for the
summer in springtime definitely the
hotter seasons come up and you want to
make sure you have a unit that's not
straight because that's gonna swell and
this one can actually keep moisture
obviously and it will actually last a
little bit longer during the day so I
think that this would be better for like
the spring and summertime looks
definitely summer if you're going to an
amusement park beach or whatever it is
vacation I think this hairstyle will
work so guys I will leave all the
information down below if you're
interested in purchasing this baby from
double leaf winged calm do not forget

comments down below subscribe and share
this video with your friends and family
people and I will catch you guys in a
later one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
