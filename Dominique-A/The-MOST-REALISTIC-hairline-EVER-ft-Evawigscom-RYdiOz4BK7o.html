Oh
the sambal
welcome back hundred thousand
subscribers oh yeah
so guys over the weekend I got the great
news that I reached 200k subscribers so
I want to say thank you to everyone who
subscribe to my channel and if you're
watching this video thank you so much
for staying with me and watching me
so today's wick Wednesday videos bar two
guys from a company called evil Winx
calm now this unit that I got set was
the s the SKU bhc 109 109 3 it's a color
number one being it's 20 inches long so
this is a full lace wig this time guys
now this one is more so of like a wet
and wavy water wave kind of loose wave
textured unit so it is 20 inches long it
is pretty it's a nice it's a nice length
not too too long it does come with three
combs only at the front so you get two
on the sides and one at the base there
is no comb in the back but they do
provide an adjustable strap with this
one it does have a perfect perimeter on
this baby right here it does have the
ear to ear tab part so you'll know
exactly where your wigs supposed to lay
I am gonna glue this down just minimally
around the perimeter so you guys can see
how it lays flat now I what I did with
this one is just do a side part I did
wet it a little bit and kind of let it
air dry so the waves are just kind of
light in like very loose wavy kind of
natural wave type I usually like my hair
like this just because sometimes it
makes it look more realistic and more
natural I'm not gonna do anything crazy
to it I tried to do braids in the braids
didn't work but let's see what I can
arrange with this one I will I did cut
the lace off I'm going to powder it in
front of you guys and you guys always
ask me about the powder the powder I
uses the BH Cosmetics Pro contour Studio
Pro contour kit and that one is the
darkest color and I will link it down
below for you guys who doesn't
interested in that palette specifically
you can technically use any palette any
powder face powder whatever that's just
the one I have and that's the one I use
so I'm gonna powder this wig up and then
I'm going to show you guys how I rocket
so if you're interested to see what this
baby looks like today guys I would like
you to stay tuned and keep
I can
Oh
so this is the wave from Eva wigs calm
so this is the final look of the hair
guys I absolutely love this unit now
this unit is definitely a low
maintenance unit if you're not the type
of person that wants to do a lot of
styling so this is like a loose wave
water wave texture so the most work
you're gonna have to do with this unit
is just wetting it adding a little bit
of product and I use the can to leave in
conditioner I leave that down below for
you guys and that's it now you can
either let this hair air dry which is
kind of like the number one thing to do
when it comes to your hair anyways
letting it air dry or you can use a
diffuser which I usually use for all my
wavy and curly units just to kind of
buff it out to find the curl and be done
and I use this diffuser if I'm kind of
like in a rush and I don't have time for
the hair to fully dry and I want to get
outside with the final look so I'll use
a diffuser now if you don't have a
diffuser like I said the number one best
way of doing your hair letting your hair
dry is by air drying I do like this unit
a lot guys it's 20 inches but it's about
like a 22 it really comes really nicely
length I believe I asked him for 150%
density so it is a bit dense it's not
the biggest density like I usually like
but it's something that I'm able to
adapt to like I said when you're
diffusing the hair and definitely gives
you more body and dries quick so these
are options when you're trying to
manipulate your units guys so keep that
in mind what major key to this unit guys
is the hairline the hairline is frickin
flawless guys I did absolutely nothing
to this unit to portray as like a
realistic scalp or anything like that
and I see you I picked the freckles so I
didn't do anything to make it look like
more realistic than what it was when it
came in the package so like I said if
you're somebody who's low maintenance
who doesn't really know how to do like a
lot with their units this one definitely
came already done all I did that you
guys saw was add powder to it to make it
look more realistic and that's about it
so anything that you guys see in my
videos is what I do I don't go extra
because let's feel the need to a lot of
these companies have been really
stepping their cookies up so they
provide to the unit already done nice so
like I said that the hair
like let's go come on guys I did
absolutely nothing to this if you put
got to be going it some of the baby
hairs will kind of grab and stick so
that's what I usually like to do let the
hair grab and stick itself I did play at
the baby hair supper in this region here
I just added some powder here to kind of
define where the hairline is supposed to
be so guys it just doesn't get any
better than this I don't like I don't
know that wig game is like serious now
and look at that girl so yeah so guys
that's basically it for this unit one
more thing I'll mention I didn't get any
shedding or tangling so far but like I
say all here
whether it's straight hair curly hair
whatever it's going to give you a little
bit of shedding and a little bit of
tangling so expect that but guys I do
like it it is full lace I did part it do
a nice deep curved part and just add
some powder to it to give it a little
bit more flavor and that's it so guys
