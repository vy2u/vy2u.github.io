look of the hair so I really really
really really like this and you guys
know I like like bob styles and stuff
like that but this is the first time
I've ever done an asymmetrical bob so
this unit is from RPG show calm now it
does come in like 12 inches right here
and about 14 to 16 inches in the front
now the reason why I really would like
this unit when they showed it to me was
that it is kind of like an ombre style
balayage look so the color is like a
number 30 guys and it comes out and
highlights towards the top part right
here and then it slowly trends down into
the ombre section which I really like I
like the fact that it kind of trickles
down into the color instead of just
coming straight into like an ombre kind
of look I do think they've really
improved their coloring skills because
there's some units that I have from them
before that were kind of over processed
or kind of just not right but I feel
like for the first time that this unit
since I've reviewed with them in awhile
that this unit is actually pretty good I
do like the whole entire look of this it
is a yaki texture which you guys know I
love yaki textured units and this one is
definitely one that you definitely want
now it is a lightweight unit guys it's
not a really thick density but it is
yaki texture it is a lace front not a
full lace so you get about three and a
half to four inches of parting space at
the top which is perfect I was able to
do like a nice deep part in it so
therefore it was just perfectly fine now
as far as styling this hair and kind of
like customizing for myself I did have
troubles doing that it was a really easy
way to do it because it did come free
plucked so that's another catch with
this company they all always give you
like everything ready so that when you
get the wig you're not confused and you
kind of know what to do the price is a
little bit steeper than usual other
companies but it is customized and it's
colored and cut so kind of like what do
you you know what I mean like come on so
I just kind of did like a little bit
baby hair magic on the sides in my
little swoops I love doing this and my
little side tab here I do go in and
tweeze this area right here just because
I need to make it look as skinny as like
not skinny skin wise as possible so it
looks like it's growing out of my head
and I did look at my baby hairs in the
front area around the perimeter but
because that part doesn't really show
it's kind of useless anyways so guys I
will
