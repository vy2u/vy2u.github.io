with another curvy / dick girl trying
haul video so today's video guides is
sponsored by shop 500 boutique so they
sent me some shapewear items and I've
worked with this company previously so
you guys already know the deal and if
you are new to my channel guys make sure
you subscribe now now I will leave all
the items down below if you're
interested in seeing or buying any of
the items that I show today now as
always guys if you're interested in see
what I have to offer in today's Tron huh
I would like you to stay tuned and keep
on watching alright guys so the first
thing I'm going to show you guys are
these really nice compression leggings
that I would sent from the company so
these are kind of like high-waisted
compression leggings so at the bottom
you'll get the regular legging material
but then you'll get like this nice kind
of like shapewear style bands for the
abdomen now I'm usually not a big fan of
this type of stuff just because these
types of shapewear really round you out
in the stomach area and if you know what
I mean leave your comments down below
this type of material really makes your
stomach very round and pronounced and it
doesn't really give you like a shape or
anything especially because these items
don't have the boning on the side if it
has boning on the side it will carry you
in very nicely however this one does not
but I do like the way it kind of Slim's
you and then kind of the way they do the
cut on this one they kind of split it
here so therefore this front area right
here has a nice kind of split area so
therefore this area will give you the
kind of look that you're going for it'll
bring you in in that spot but as far as
it just going up to the sides like that
it doesn't really do that much for the
body it kind of rounds you out but I do
like these guys just because of material
it's very very soft not itchy it's a
nice stretchy material I got these in a
size extra large and I just I just did
it right like it just worked very nicely
they are a material where you can either
wear it like athletic wise or you can
wear it like dress wise so if you just
want to wear like leggings with sneakers
that's cool
but if you want to wear some nice fancy
leggings with some heels or something
like that these will work so that's one
thing I really appreciate about this
company and if you do have a shorter
torso kind of guys in a bigger butt I'd
recommend that you pull it up before so
when you put it on just don't think that
you're just gonna put it on like that
definitely kind of fit yourself in your
first just because the way that
cut is on the leggings you need to lift
let me show you guys you guys need to
actually lift it above you guys need to
lift this line above your butt so that
for it sits correctly when I first put
it on I was like this doesn't even look
right like what is this so don't be
afraid when you first try it on make
sure you kind of tug it over your butt
so therefore it sits properly and then
it's on nice I like the fact that the
back is not too see-through so you're
not kind of seeing all the nooks and
crannies in the back a lot of those like
is that I purchased from like forever 21
etc etc you can see all the nooks and
crannies you can say hello to the world
it's just so exposed these aren't too
exposed these kind of have nice coverage
and it just looks really good so I
probably end up going and buying one
myself just because I think that these
are very good quality like I said
they're very it's very durable got like
it's durable these aren't the types I'm
gonna catch the holes in it or you know
and that's the thing about forever21
leggings if you got nails like me you
hit that you hit that thigh with it you
already got a hole in the legging so you
don't have to worry about that with this
one and then on top this one is
connected with a shapewear so it's just
like totally perfect so the next shaper
I'm gonna show you guys is actually one
that I have similar to but I don't have
it as great as this one is now if you
someone that's looking for a high impact
high kind of constriction and you really
want to be snatch snatch I definitely
recommend getting like the full body
ones so I do have a thong one that's
kind of like upper torso and with the
straps and I have two short style ones
but I never ever got the chance to
review the long one which comes all the
way above the knee cap now this one is
really good guys when I mean high
compression it really sucks you in now I
got this one in a size extra large as
well and great choice now I would say
when you're picking these out pick your
shirt size and if you're like a little
bit scared pick a size above your shirt
size just because you don't want to get
it too tight and then you're like
rolling up or looking like really really
late like that now what I did notice is
that and how they my boobs are a little
bit big I look really like hmm you know
in these types of stuff but over time
I'll just kind of get used to it used to
the look and used to how compressed it
is so this one has a zip up in the front
and it also has like clips inside of it
so you actually have to hook these up
and then you zip up I highly recommend
doing that because if you
hook them first you will not be able to
fit into this at all so I hooked them on
and then I sip it up and it does have
straps if you do have a bigger if you
have like a wider short or your like bra
to have wider shoulders and like a
bigger rack I would say adjust this one
because initially they it's going to be
really really tight when you put it on
and it's fullback guys so you get like
full compression all the way through and
the back part it's funny because when I
try this on I didn't realize that when
you put this on it's see-through so it's
kind of see-through in the back when you
put this part on but I do like it a lot
guys I know they probably ought to flag
this video if I turn around but whatever
so parental advisory guys but I think
that this is really good guys it's
definitely and even tried on with the
dress it just you can't see it it's like
undetectable you want B to be able to
see it unless someone grabs you on the
waist and like tries to pull you towards
them they'll probably feel like a little
bit of something but it's really
undetectable when you're wearing dresses
you can't see anything and it definitely
curves you out fixes you up and you're
looking fabulous like I honestly I'm so
happy that I picked this one out guys
it's it's full compression it definitely
gives you your body a nice look and you
know it's funny it's not an illusion of
a look it's just put it's basically just
closing you up and putting you back
together and that's it I really really
like this a lot guys it's so so good and
like I said I have back fat which is
it's annoying but I have back fat so
therefore this gives me the full
compression in the back as well too so
I'm not having like extra areas hanging
out so that's definitely something to
consider when you're purchasing this if
you do have back fat and you want to
conceal it in some dresses
you can wear it like the thick of
spaghetti strap dresses with this and
it'll be covered you don't have to worry
about anyone looking at you crazy and
seeing kind of like that little fat
nugget hang in the back so that's one
thing to consider when you're buying
these because they definitely are full
alright guys so the next two items that
I'm going to show you guys are kind of
together I try them on together for you
just because I made it easier so the
first thing I'm going to show you guys
is this a really cool compression Brawl
not even compression bra so like after
surgical bra now I did get my breasts
done January 11 so it's been a month
almost two months as I had it done I
don't know if you guys want to review or
kind of like a month
update on my breast augmentation just
leave her comments down below I kind of
like I already got it done the first
time I just went in for a revision so
it's kind of like do you really want to
hear me talk about this again probably
not so I will so they decided to send me
guys one of their post surgical bras now
I am two months post-op so it is good
though when you go to sleep to wear this
just because um when I'm sleeping at I
just kind of feel like they're like
either squash or they kind of like you
know I'm having trouble with them when
I'm sleeping it's just kind of weird
it's really weird especially because I'm
like way bigger than I was the first
time around so I'm just kind of
adjusting to the size and positions when
I sleep just because I kind of feel a
lot of when I sleep on my stomach I can
fill out a pressure on them when I sleep
on my side is just kind of like an extra
body part now so they send me this
really nice compression bra or kind of
like post-surgical bra and I opted for
the size let's see what size of that I
got this size 36 d I think 36 D now I
have not got size yet but the 36 D for
me is a little bit tight
it's just really compressing on the
boobs I don't I don't know and like I
don't know what my size is yeah I have
not gone to get fitted so I assume
because when I first stood up my surgery
I was a 30-30 60 so I still got to be
like D or maybe like a double D I'm not
sure yet but I'm not a d I don't think
so so um never gonna have to get that
rectified soon but I got the 36 D just
to test it out it is a little bit tight
guys but it definitely kind of holds
them in it kind of puts them all the way
on the bottom of your chin but if you're
someone that's having surgery are
planning to have a breast augmentation
and you want to make sure you have like
extra supplies of surgical bras or kind
of like a post post-op bras I definitely
recommend purchasing this this one the
one they give you at the at the doctor's
office is really cheap really like it's
a piece of crap and it doesn't really do
that that much for you at all it's like
really irritating as well - this one has
soft panels on the breast area so
therefore your nipples don't get
irritated it does have an adjustable
strap area on this front right here so I
think it goes up to two levels so
depending on how tight you want it to be
you can do it on the first left or
second latch it does have adjustable
straps and on the arm as well - on the
shoulder as well so you can even make it
loose medium or tight so that's a good
thing
it is full coverage in the back as well
too so if you do have love handles or
fatback handles like I do it does kind
of hold in all the fat back area so it's
full coverage all the way through I
thought that this was really nice and
thoughtful the company like I said if
you're someone that's having a breast
reduction breast lift breast off and
you're looking for some nice bras or
kind of like a nice post surgical bra
don't be looking to purchasing this one
just because it's full coverage it'll
keep you nice and comfortable and your
nipples won't be irritated after the
surgery which is the main issue that I
haven't had my surgery my nipples
weren't irritated now the second and
thing that goes in correspondence is
this one that I tried on is this a nice
little waist trainer now I haven't done
waist trainers in a long time I just
recently started doing my waist training
again like just like in the last few
weeks and I'm actually very excited and
I'm actually starting to see results so
I'm really really happy like I'm seeing
my waist come in so I'm like yes this is
working so I would do a separate video
if you guys want on something that I'm
using and it's actually from a youtuber
that's she's a youtuber and she has her
own like a waist trainer line and I'm
impressed it actually is really good guy
so if you want me to tell you guys more
about that just leave your comments down
below so this waist trainer they sent me
I was a little skeptical about this one
because they look small so I picked this
one on the size extra large as well um I
do have a longer torso so I was afraid
that this isn't gonna fit my biggest
issue with waist trainers is that I have
back fat so my back fat will go over the
waist writer and I try to avoid stuff
like that now what I the reason why I
tried both of these items together is
because wearing this one with the full
coverage bra kind of molded me out so
I'll cover the back fat situation which
is excellent so if you do have waist
chanters alright giving you like a
little bit of a larger back fat showing
you can definitely just put like a full
coverage bra on top of it just to cover
it and kind of push the back fat
together if you know what I mean so this
one is just your basic waist trainer
guys it's a really nice material
it definitely has your standard boning
in the back of it so it's definitely
keep you high and tight these really
boast you up and make you look like you
know you're like standing at attention
so this one has an inner class too it's
not like you're a regular waist trainer
where you gonna do like the you'll see
the outside rage it's a zip up one so
you're kind of hooking up like a bra
strap in the front and then you'll zip
it up what I'm gonna tell you when you
try to put this on make sure you do the
hook up the hooks first and then zip up
if you don't do the hooks first you will
run into a lot of issues trying to put
this on so I was able to stand up and do
this I didn't have to lay down and do
that whole entire orchestrated show off
and show I actually could lay down and
put that I didn't have to lay down and
put this on I just stood up and was able
to put the hooks on and then dip it up
which was excellent so this one is
really good guys it definitely pulls me
in and the thing about that I've been
working on doing my waist training stuff
so I'm actually really happy and I'm
seeing results this one actually was
really nice and compressed me in and
because these had the zip up method
these are undetectable under clothes
like honestly you will not be able to
see it so if you wanted to wear this to
the gym possibly or you wanted to just
put this on with like an outfit and you
didn't want to wear like the full body
garment you can actually wear this but
like I said I would wear like a full
coverage bra bra if you have back fat to
just compress you in a little bit so
that it doesn't look kind of uneven and
lumpy so that's one thing to keep in
mind alright guys so that's the body for
the review it wasn't a long review but I
hope I explain this stuff to it alright
guys so that's about it for today's
review I hope you guys enjoy this review
I try to give you guys a better
explanation seeing that I didn't get a
lot of items and I want to show you guys
exactly how they fit how they look so
that you guys have a better
understanding I leave all the links down
