oh it up oh it up
let's now we better let Sally better
sorry
hey guys how's it going start back today
with another hair view so this here that
I'm sporting today guys it's from virgin
hair fix so they sent me a 14 inch
closure of 14 16 and 18 inch bundle so I
used all the hair for this custom wing
that I created now this is not anything
crazy I wanted to do color but I was a
little bit nervous this time so I'm
probably going to come back and do color
with this unit so leave a comment down
below on what kind of color you should
think I should do if I should do like
kind of like an ombre with this or do
just like a full-out color
I think this hair is really pretty and
it will look good with some color on it
now if you want to begin in the video
obviously you notice that I did go on
with my deep waver to kind of deep wave
and define the waves
now this hair is a wavy texture but what
I noticed is that the closure was way
more wavy compared to the bundles
Express to the 18-inch bundle in the
back it just kind of fell a little bit
short when it came to the wave pattern
so what I had to do was go in with my
deep waver and just deep wave the hair
in the back
and kind of like towards the crown area
up here just because it just wasn't
matching and the hair didn't have like
this large plush look that I was
expecting when you I did co-wash the ear
so after you co-wash it definitely has a
nice wave pattern but like I said the
wave pattern isn't isn't defined all the
way through the closure is really wavy
and the bundles are just kind of like a
light wave versus the closure being like
a full-blown wave so I definitely had to
go on a manipulator with my deep flavor
but one thing I can say about this hair
guys it's SuperDuper soft like it's like
really soft it looks like it's a lot of
hair right now just because I deep waved
it and if you in the begin of the video
I showed you guys what it looked like
before I deep waved and the hair just
was kind of like really big and like
fluffy it's really big and fluffy hair
but it's very light hair guys and it's
very soft it's not the type of hair that
you're gonna have like a lot of heavy
feel on and I use all the bundles and it
just feel like wow this really feels
like it's like a bundle or two the hair
is super duper light as far as the
closure goes I haven't worked with a
closure in a long time so I was trying
to I was like crossing my fingers that
this came out right so all I did was
just pre pluck a little bit of the front
of it and then just play with the bait
lay the baby hair down and I did just
add some powder so I made this into a
middle part wig you definitely take the
wig and shift it I shifted it a little
and I didn't like the way look so I'm
just going to keep in the middle part
way
I'm just not used to working with
closures anymore I'm so used to doing
frontals now cuz rentals are just like
the new thing but I do think that if
you're someone that doesn't know how to
do a lot of baby here and stuff like
that
that you just start off with closures
and then work your way up I started off
with do it with closures first and then
I kind of gradually went into frontals
it's just a learning process so
definitely if you're someone that
doesn't know how to do front tolls and
like customize front tools etc et-cetera
I highly recommend you start off with a
closures and kind of experiment with
closures this one is definitely a nice
closure the hair is very good quality
here like I said the only kind of notice
with this here just doesn't wave
correctly like together so I did have to
blow my styling to my heated my styling
tool and kind of give the look more
vamped up wave pattern other than that
guys I do think it's very pretty hair
the whole look together came up very
nice and the hair is super soft as far
as shedding I didn't receive any
shedding with the hair so far and yeah
so I will come back and update you guys
and I am going to change this hair into
a different color I might do a full
blown colored wig or might do kind of
like the ombre bosh type style unit and
I will come back it will look completely
different so I hope you guys like that
right guys do not forget to thumbs up
