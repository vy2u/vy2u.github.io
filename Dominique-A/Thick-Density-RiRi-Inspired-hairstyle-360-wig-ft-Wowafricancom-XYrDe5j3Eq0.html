with another wing video so today this
week that you guys see me sporting today
is from wall African calm now this unit
is a 360 wid guys it's a hundred and
eighty percent density it is 22 inches
long and it's nice a nice natural wave
texture now I really really like this
wig number one because of the density if
you guys watch a lot of my videos I
always talk about density being one of
the most important things to me along
with texture as well now for my straight
type style units I do like yaki and for
my kind of curly / wavy style units I do
go for the loose waver natural wave
preferably the first now this unit guys
I was trying to go for kind of like that
Rihanna here so she did in that um she
had like a pink shirt on and she gotta
have like this half-up half-down kind of
look all I did with mine is add like a
little bit of a wide string on top of
the ponytail area so it just came it
kind of a little bit of a jazz to it now
this here guys I threw it to one side
just because I wanted to kind of have
like more emphasis on my right side now
you guys can see this is definitely a
really really thick unit this by itself
is just how thick the ponytail is guys
and I still have hair in the back left
over so this is how thick the ponytail
is the destiny on this wig is by far one
hundred eighty percent density this is
almost like 200 225 250 it's super super
thick now I think maybe it's because
there's a little bit wavy and it's not
weighed down by like you know products
cuz I didn't put any products in this
hair but guys the density is perfect now
I definitely have any gapping in the
back when I put it all the way to the
side
you guys won't see any likes empty
spaces in the back which is something
that I always look for when I'm doing my
units if I have a unit and it has like a
little bit I can see the back of the
wall through my head it's just not good
but with this unit guys I don't have
that issue it just is really really nice
now I did go and try to put the baby
hairs with this unit it does its comes
pre plucked but it's not as pre plucked
as you may think so you definitely have
to go in with your tweezer and kind of
give yourself a little bit more space
on the unit so I just kind of went back
and just took a little bit of hair off
the hairline I didn't go extra extra
crazy just because the hair was really
really soft and silky and I just didn't
want to make any bald spots anybody went
to crazy and that's another thing when
it comes to texture the lighter the
texture is you got to be careful when
you're tweezing because you probably
make I've had instance actually where
I've made like little bald spots so I
try to be careful with that area like
really good as far as the baby hair guys
I didn't really go crazy with the baby
hair in the beginning I almost hated the
baby hairs that I did and then I kind of
just pulled them down a little bit and
try to make them look a little bit more
natural when you do put the black got to
be glue gel on it it does kind of make
it a little bit more stiff so what I do
after I add it on let it dry I just go
in and gonna flake it off so that it has
more like of a natural appearance
instead of it just being SuperDuper kind
of like stiff looking but I do like
working it wearing it this way and this
is kind of like what I wanted to do
originally but I always do hairstyles
like this so I opted to do the full kind
of like side ponytail kind of like it
almost turned into like a beast I beat
behind
Beyonce style like this so I definitely
thought that this was cuter and almost
looks like I've actually pulled the
whole entire wig up until ponytail but I
did it I simply just tuck the back piece
to the side like this and rocked it this
way so I definitely that this unit is
really nice I will link all the
information down below if you guys are
interested in purchasing this it is 360
so it does have four inches of parting
space in the front and about two inches
of parting space in the back you can opt
to wear this in a ponytail or style up
or do any type of those fancy hairstyles
if you would like I think it works
either way I think it'll look good down
it'll look good up so guys do not forget
