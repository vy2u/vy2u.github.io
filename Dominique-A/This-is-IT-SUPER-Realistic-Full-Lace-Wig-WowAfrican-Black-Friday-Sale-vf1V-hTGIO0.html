sporting today is from whoa African calm
well African or Wow African whatever so
I love this unit guys obviously has been
tell in the beginning I cut the lace up
did all my extra additives to this one
to achieve this beautiful look now you
guys are probably looking at me like yo
that looks really good like honestly and
truly guys I usually don't glue all my
units down when I'm reviewing it because
I review here so often but I had to do
this one down because I am definitely be
wearing this for Thanksgiving and a
little bit past that Thanksgiving Day
this unit guys is so pop and like look
at how beautiful this hairline is like
grated I did have to go in and tweeze it
but I just did that just to customize it
to what I wanted it to be like if you
don't know how to tweeze here I think
you'll be fine with the hair the way it
came just because it did come tweeze so
you never really have to do too much but
I was being extra so I went as far as
tweezing mines and then do all this like
baby hair magic stuff so I did go in and
trim the baby hairs as well too just
because they were a little bit too long
for me so I just tweeze the I tweeze the
perimeter and then I cut the baby hairs
but guys just just look at this like and
I can even pull this this this is not
going anywhere that got to be glue is
really really good like this wig isn't
going anywhere guys and it looks like I
can just like this is a full lace wig
too guys so you can go ahead and bring
your hands to her like it's your real
hair or he can even run his hands to
like it's your like your real here but
guys oh my god
I just and this reminds me of the unit
that I reviewed maybe like a few weeks
ago but this one it's like upscale like
