now today's whip review is brought to
you guys from a company called RPG hair
calm now I work with this company before
in the past so I'm back with another way
from them
the first way that I did was the curly
unit and I will link down that video
down below for you guys I absolutely
love that hair I still have it till this
day and I keep rocking rocking it in
these high buns and that's not a 360 wig
that's just a basic lace front way so
but I'm still able to rock it in high
buns like if I wanted to so I really
really really love that hair and curly
hair is very hard to manage and buy from
certain places because it usually will
tangle up or matte up or like get crazy
but from this company I had no problems
with their curly hair so definitely
check out that video down below now this
week that they sent me is kinky straight
hair textured wig and it's the natural
color it's 20 inches long 180 percent
density and it is a 360 lace frontal wig
and yes I'm reading it from my info
sheet now it came in a package like this
and it's a really nice package it has
the company's logo and everything on it
so they kept it real professional the
wig is really nice guys I really like it
the thing about the wig I notice is it's
really dense and because of the kinky
texture it's like even more dense so
what I'm probably going to do with this
unit guys is straighten it out as use
but when you straighten up kinky
textured hair like this you always have
that kink to it which I'm really looking
forward to so the cousin here has the
wig I saw has about four inches of
parting space at the top there's a coma
at the base here and two combs at the
side it also has a comb in the back and
adjustable straps as well it's about two
inches of parting space in the back
right here and then like I said for on
the top the only thing is that's
annoying is this comb in the front if
you're trying to do that bridge or
something this comb will have like a
little bit of like a bump right here so
I don't even use this comb so I'm
probably going to just cut the base comb
out because it
Nessus and it kind of gets in the way
from the style so that comb is going to
come out what I did notice is they did
actually pre their seat bleach the knife
in the front which is different well
it's not different it is on the last
unit and the only thing I like about
that is that when they bleach the knots
in the front it actually makes the hair
look better in the beginning and you
don't really have to do too much to make
it look natural which is a plus plus so
I'm going to strain this out and
probably style it for you guys and come
back and show you guys what it looks
like so interested to see what this unit
looks like
okay so this is what the wig looks like
and I am so so happy like I told you
guys before I went in and shave my hair
little I didn't do like a blunt straight
honest I just kind of went to it with
one stroke and this is how it turned out
but I really like this I did receive
some shedding when I was straining the
hair I didn't get any tangling
whatsoever no tangling at all what I can
say about this when it does have a long
parting space about four four and a half
inches of parting space and you can do
like a lot of styles with it I didn't
prep I didn't go this dump purposely
just because I'm switching over wigs and
stuff but I did just put some got to be
glue on the baby here just got to make
it look realistic and I did like when
those those top buns I think that this
here is fabulous if you like that really
kinky natural straight look and I really
like and match it like it looks like you
got your hair blowdried this is the
perfect weight for that look this looks
really really realistic it's about 20
inches long so it's not too too long it
stops like right underneath the brass
and it's just like come on like it just
looks so good like it's really realistic
looking you can do ponytails stuff like
that but you guys know me I rarely
deploy me tails but if you want to do a
ponytail you can get away with the
ponytail without any issues because like
I said it's late this is 360 so there's
legs all the way around so you will be
able to get away with like ponytail
styles and stuff like that but for me a
cute little hairstyle the front like a
little design in the front or whatever
will just be perfect for me I think that
this is it if you're looking for
inexpensive
yaki kinky straight hair this website
does offer an expensive units for that
for a very affordable price guys and I
definitely am going to say this our VG
here has got it going on I did my second
review with this company and I am NOT
disappointed whatsoever so yes guys so
definitely go ahead and check this
website out I will link down everything
down below for you guys as use
