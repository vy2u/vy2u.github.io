another wig Wednesday video so in
today's video I'll be showing you guys
the unit that I created myself and the
hair is provided from wavy hair calm now
previously work with la vie hair calm
and I will insert down below a video
that I did for them I had I reviewed the
Malaysian natural wave here for them and
I even showed you guys what it looked
like when I colored it after so it was
kind of like a double take without hair
you had to have it black or you could
have a blonde and I absolutely love that
hair quality it just took bleached
really well it kept a style and it was
just it was just everything so I agreed
to work with this company again so this
year that I'm show you guys today is
their Brazilian straight hair now they
have the premium quality hair now they
send me 3 bundles of 18 inches and then
of 16 inch frontal I only use two
bundles just because with the frontal
you actually active takes a little bit
more space on the way cap so therefore
you don't have to add that much hair and
I didn't want this unit to be too bulky
so I just kind of like this single
tracks will kept them tight together so
that I didn't have too much of a bulky
back so this way print lays pretty flat
now I really like the front so because
the frontal looks very realistic even
without a cap it looks really realistic
guys it does have a great hairline and
also has great baby hairs in the front
so I'm going to glue this one down to
show you guys what it looks like so that
I could show you guys the style that I
want to do with it so that's not always
like the middle part side part that I'd
be rocking because that's just my thing
thanks to my hair today
and I will link down this hair down
below for you guys to because you guys
actually bought this wig all the time
this is one of my favorite hairstyles
right here it's just it's perfect for
the summertime so I'd be rocking this
one all the time
now this unit guys I love the hair the
hair texture is very nice it's a
mean of silky and a yaki texture so you
definitely get like a little bit of off
with it I will do a styling tutorial
with this one like maybe hi curly how it
you know something really good so I
could show you guys what it does with
the styling tool versus just wearing it
straight because I definitely think that
this one has potential like I said it's
18 inches long so it's not super duper
long but it's it's long enough for the
summer time so it's one of those
hairstyles you can work for this summer
so what I'm going to do is got to be
glue the baby down and I'm going to
style and show you guys what it looks
like now if you guys are interested in
seeing today
and
alright guys it's like I've been having
so much fun with this hair I've been
taking selfies on snap Instagram story
and just loving it loving loving now
obviously I laid the hair down with the
got to be blue method I do need to go on
buy some more because I had to cut it
because I'm running out bug girl I am
feeling so 90s in this cute little hair
style now
this isn't like the largest density just
for the simple fact I didn't pull all
the bundles but I think this is enough
to be like a realistic look like it
looks so natural and so realistic like
like you can't tell me this is not cute
like and I usually in this I'm going to
say that usually don't do here so I like
this I usually do like a side part
middle part keep it real boring and
stuff like that but I wanted to try this
one with this hair just because the hair
touch it was pretty else okay you know
let me do like a little up half-up
half-down type of look for you guys just
because I'm just like wow now this is
really nice guys I did not get any
shedding from the hands as far when I
ran my strainer through it no tailing
whatsoever in the Napier and none of
that kind of stuff then again it is
straight here so you won't really see
too much of that problem going on I do
love the front too like I said I had to
cut the baby hairs around kind of like
make it molded into Dom style I'm really
not like crazy crazy crazy ball baby
hairs like that but for this here so I
thought that it would look cute with
like the whole 90s look doing like the
hoop earrings or the baby hair so I
really think that this is fleek EAS just
tell me what you guys think down below
this is not one of the hair cells I
would go go for it just because I'm kind
of boring when it comes to ease and wigs
but this one bitch this is it like this
is cute
like wait let me just oh my god like
it's just it's just there so I'm really
excited about this and I'm so happy that
I made it into this look I think it
would look you in the middle parts eye
part whatever but if you're just trying
to do extra stretch ivy do a lot of
different things you can even do like
those two little top knot things I did
in my last video I think it will just
look so cute with this and I'm really
feeling this the density's like perfect
to the point that looks realistic
so yes I'm really excited I really like
this guy so don't forget guys to leave
your comments down below thumbs up this
video share this video and
go buy if you haven't already and I will
catch you guys later on another week
Wednesday in another fashion Friday's
