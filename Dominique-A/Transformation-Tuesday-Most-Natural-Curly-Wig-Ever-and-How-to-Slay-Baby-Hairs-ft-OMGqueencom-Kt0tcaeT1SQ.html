hey guys how's it going so I'm back
today with another transformation
Tuesday video so I haven't done one of
these videos in a long time but I
decided to try to bring this back to you
guys because I know I can get boring
sometimes always seeing me modeling the
wig so I want to show you guys how I
apply the ways on someone else so today
my cousin Monica decided to be my model
today and she's someone who's not really
into curly units but I was able to
change her whole entire life this time
around so she really really loves this
unit she's still rocking it till this
moment and she's just like like just
crazy about it so this student was
provided by OMG Queen here and it is 14
inches long it's a virgin brazilian hair
and it's a curly texture now it is a
lace front so it's not a 360 were you
getting lace in the back and lace in the
front you're just getting about three
inches of lace in the front and that's
about it
this wig is kind of big head friendly
because she has a large head and I have
a small head and this unit fit her
precisely
I believe they capsized about an average
capsize so if you have a large head and
you find certain a witch capsize again I
believe the medium or the average
capsize will work perfectly for you now
I am going to tell you guys I did do
like a little beat on her in the
beginning so I'll add that into the
video because I want it to be a complete
transformation so she did get like a
little beat down in the beginning and
then I'm gonna show you guys how I apply
the wig down do the baby hairs all that
kind of stuff so you guys can see
exactly how the install looks final
product and all so guys if you're
interested in seeing the final
transformation I would like you to stay
tuned and keep on watching
alright guys so this taken like I said I
wanted to do this like a complete
transformation Tuesday so I could do a
makeup in here view the videos based on
the but why not just because she really
was happy to submit scum to browse
concealer a little eye shadow some blog
and then the wig so the confident look
obviously you saw the beginning clip it
just came up so nice she wasn't really
really happy and like I said she's not
some of the lights curly hair but this
way and this makeup really put her in a
different space and she was definitely
really really happy
wait all the way to the end I'm gonna go
it down to the air magic and everything
it just turned out so so pretty nice and
I'm so so happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
