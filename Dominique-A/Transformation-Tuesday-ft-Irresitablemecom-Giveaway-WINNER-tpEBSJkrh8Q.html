with another hair video for you guys so
if you watched my last last fashion
Friday video I did mention that I was
going to try to incorporate some
transformation Tuesday's so today will
be my first ever transformation Tuesday
featuring my little sister Dani so this
week or this hair I'm showing you guys
today is from irresistible me so they're
just a strictly hair extensions type of
company but I do think that they sell
units so they sent me some hair clips
now the one that she chose is an actual
black 1b 16 inch 200 grams so they said
about a few pieces of extensions so she
has like a long big thick one for the
back and she has a couple other long
pieces and they do something kind of
like those little quarter pieces so
basically we're gonna do today for you
guys to show you guys how I put the
clips on in here and style her hair with
the clips so we're gonna put the clips
in and do some nice kind of curl wand
styling with this and give her more of a
voluptuous look my sister my sister is
actually part of the natural hair
committee so that you can show you tip
your head so she basically has super
natural hair and the only thing she does
with her hair most of the time is blow
dry it out and straighten it
she doesn't really strain in here all
the time she's more so of a curly hair
type of personality and start of clip in
here of her hair when it's really curly
so she'll sometimes just do that and
this is the first time she's really
straighter here in a long time so I'm
going to add this time we're gonna add
some extensions and to kind of give him
more of a voluptuous look so guys I'm
gonna stop her on camera and show you
guys exactly how it looks I'm really
excited to do this it's gonna look
poppin and I'm gonna show you guys
individually each of the clip in so you
guys can see exactly what they look like
so basically they do like they just put
the basic clips on it like you're
basically black clips you can actually
make these yourselves but the difference
with this company is they make them
really sturdy the last one that is in
the back I don't know if this is a new
construction that they have and this is
probably the thickest clipping and this
one actually has like a double panel
clip and it comes with four clips on it
and it's like really thick so this is
the one we're gonna place in the back
because it has the most volume in it so
to give her more more hair in the back
but I think the way that they did this
is awesome because with this just one
little clip you got a loss of hair this
is like really really thick so I'm gonna
try to see we're gonna try to make her
look you know like
I'm gonna do a have my sister look like
me kind of video so if you guys want to
see that I do have another sister too so
we're gonna keep these transformations
Tuesdays roll in if you know what I mean
so guys if you're interested in seeing
how Dani transforms today I would like
you to stay tuned and keep on watching
alright guys so this is the final result
of the hair my sister loves it right
there beautiful so basically I just did
the curl lines on it to kind of blend
the hair in her real hair and obviously
you could see her real hair right here
but kind of blending in and with the
clippings kind of made it a little bit
easier it's a really nice kind of like
natural kind of look and I think that'll
look good with the curl once she likes
it a lot guys and she never does baby
here it's like I do so I try to show you
guys hides the baby hairs on her and she
absolutely loves it so she might even
try to do that now so I use about how
many cups I use I use one today for five
of the large clips and then one of the
little clips on the side right there so
or four or five of the larger clips and
then one baby clip on the side so I
didn't use too much of the clips but it
actually came out really nice and she's
like to me why don't you ever do my hair
like this but Hank no time
so this today is a nice little gift her
so she really likes it and hope you guys
like it as well so I know you guys are
