an update on the Lavi hair calm here
that I received if you watch my other
video you see on the first install that
is it with this hair they sent me three
bundles of hair and a closure and I will
link down the links down below for you
guys now basically what I wanted to do
was try to transform it I have a lot of
hair that she's black so I wanted to do
like a nice ombre for the summertime
springtime so I decided to ombre this
one blonde now this hair bleached very
well what I did notice is that the
closure bleached a little bit faster and
quicker faster quicker faster and better
than the bundles but I actually like the
way it came out just because it's not
like a perfect ombre it's kind of like a
messy ombre and the tones of the colors
actually came out really nice now the
ends of the hair remains like a lighter
blonde color but the blonde really came
through at the closure part but
obviously you can tell it's kind of one
of those like natural like colors like
it's not like an idols those six blonde
colors that you usually do when you go
to the salon it's like really messy and
nice so for this look I was going for
more of like a beachy fun look with this
hair in color so I just kind of
freelance and kind of went all around
and just started adding the dye on there
wasn't a specific way that I was trying
to do this I was just kind of like let
me just dive in to see what it comes out
like so what I will say is that this
hair definitely dies perfectly and if
you're trying to change lists with
virgin hair this company does have hair
that can transform like that now you
guys are going to ask me how I what I
did with the dye so basically I use 40
volumes developer and I use just your
regular bleaching powder and I'll show
you guys the bleaching powder that I use
I use the one from stylist and salon
care and it's a quick white bleaching
powder now this one is pretty good and
it works pretty well with my coloring
routine and I just used 40 bones
developer with it now to tone the hair I
always use the ash toner and I will link
down the videos down below for you guys
where I did an extra demonstration on
how I ash my extensions period so I will
show you guys again this is the Revlon
number 70 medium ash blonde now
use this faithfully on all my blonde
hair because this box of hair dye ashes
the hair out perfectly and you just get
a really really nice tone now this is
only two thousand ninety seven cents at
Walmart so you can't beat that you can
go out to size get the Wella charms but
the weather times is about like six
dollars when you can delegate you have
to pay three dollars for this and you
get two for six so it's kind of like you
can do the job with the Revlon color
silks hair down the number 70 medium ash
blonde so that's what I did with this
when I left the dye on for about an hour
and then I kind of forgot and I went
back and watched it and this is the
color that I got like it just it just
looks good guys I just really really
liked it and I definitely would
recommend you guys check out la vie hair
calm because even after I dyed to here
the hair is still loose wave and I'll
show you guys before and after like
because I guys can see what it look like
when I was black and wavy like the hair
is still nice and actually feel like
it's a little bit more wavier than
before so it's kind of crazy but yeah so
everything you guys will need to know
for this hair will be linked down below
for you guys and I will link down the
video for how I custom ash blonde my
units I did do a video for in detail
instructions on how to Asheville on your
hair and that's about hey guys so don't
forget to thumbs up this video leave
your comments down below and also hit
that subscribe button if you have it and
I will catch you guys later
