alright guys so this unit is was sent to
me from RPG here so I'm gonna have to
show you guys this first before I do
anything to it because I don't want you
guys to be confused so this is supposed
to be their first ever kind of like
blonde ombre style unit guys I just I
can't
now the wig is stuff the construction of
the wig is perfect but the color is a
knot so I'm gonna leave the brown roots
just because I think the car I'm going
to turn into will be okay with brown
roots but the blonde with the brown like
this for me guys is an absolute no and
to make matters worse the hair isn't
even long enough so it's not like you
can be put trade so it's kind of like a
bob style may put curls in it and I just
guys I can so I'm going to call this
hair kind of like a medium auburn color
which is almost kind of like that orange
color that everyone's been rocking I got
the one from Revlon color six and I'll
show you guys the box after I figure
everything out but this is I'm gonna
call this because I cannot wear this
like this is just not nice and it's just
not it doesn't look good on me so I'm
gonna change it up for you guys before I
show you guys a final result but this is
what it looked like before
homeboy
that
ow ow ow ow ow
money
yes how's it going so I'm back today
with another hair view so my hair looks
completely different from the beginning
of video obviously that I saw so when I
first got this here from RPG here it was
a mess so it's basically one of their
ombre styled units but they basically
gave me a unit that was really light
brown at the roots and kind of like a
strawberry blonde at the end so when I
initially got the unit I was like there
is no way that I am going to wear this
wig out like this or even attempt to
style it on camera for you guys because
it would have been a slap in your face
and a slap in my face so I basically
went out and bought some hair dye so I
bought two boxes of the Revlon color
silks a forty two medium Auburn now I
love Revlon color soap just because it's
really cheap and gets the job done and
then the look is complete so I saturated
the entire wig guys so basically what I
do is put in a plastic bag put the hair
dye all over squish it together and left
it there for thirty minutes so there's
really not that like Sharpe method to
this I just kind of throw the hair dye
all over the unit and then that's that
so because the roots were kind of light
brown it did kind of pick up a little
bit of that orange you kind of look in
the brown area so I really think that
that worked out perfectly on my behalf
as far as the rest of the color I
absolutely loved it and I kind of had
when I saw it once it was drying I
looked at it I thought it was almost
gonna be like a rose gold color I was
like damn I messed this one up so this
was almost a fail guys so I'm happy that
after it dried out and I curled and
styled it that it came out so freakin
lovely like I think that this is so
great and I just use box dye like I
didn't use anything crazy and this is a
final look I absolutely love it guys and
I did show you guys how I cut and styled
it so I basically was going for a
higher-up bob cut so it's really really
short in the back and comes down to this
nice length which is an acceptable
length I've been really liking Bob units
just because it gives you kind of more
of like a classical cute look kind of
refined look and this color is totally
acceptable with this type of hairstyle
so I just thought that you know I was I
was like you know I was I was feeling it
I'm feeling it yeah so I definitely like
this cut with this one it was about it
was supposed to be like a 14 inch with
the 14 inch wasn't doing it so I just I
just ended that little moment and I just
said let me cut it up and just do some
thing else so basically I did kind of
transform this week completely it was a
god it was a mess before but the good
thing about ordering wigs that are kind
of um braids or blonde wigs is that you
have the opportunity to do whatever you
want with them so if you do like
customizing units you want to try doing
like a blue purple pink or whatever it
is or even trying this color which is
really popular right now I doesn't
recommend buying an ombre style unit and
then just going there from I'm going
from there with it now with this one
guys I'm gonna say I'm not sure what the
price is but I'll link it down below so
if it is that at a very affordable price
which I'm pretty sure it is cuz this
website is pretty inexpensive you'll be
able to spend your money on this and
customize the unit by yourself which is
a plus now guys I will leave all the
information down below for you guys if
you guys are interested in this baby
right here or not really this baby bub a
version of this baby you guys will have
all the details down below on how to get
this color and all that stuff so don't
worry about that now guys do not forget
