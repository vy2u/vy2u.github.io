excited about today's video guys because
I have not reviewed like a box pretty
unit or kind of like a braiding unit in
a while now I was really into these kind
of cool braids that I'm rocking right
now but I didn't want to do it on my
real hair just because I have like thin
edges and my hair is super duper short
so it's gonna be hard to achieve this
hairstyle so when I was contacted by
this company off an Instagram called
rasie signature hairs I was like really
hype I initially was going to order a
unit like this from another Instagram
company prior to me going to Thailand
but these units actually come handmade
from Nigeria so it was gonna take too
long for it to come and I was just like
really late with the ordering so what I
did get the opportunity to review this
one I was really excited I do have other
trips coming up so this is definitely
going to be a perfect unit for vacation
now this unit is actually handmade guys
so it's a lace frontal wig and it's like
just a stocking cap in the back that
stocking cap like a mesh dome cap and
then she also added an elastic band on
for me now if you do want her Instagram
she posts like a lot of pictures she
sells braided wigs she sells like you
know many are wigs like ombre style wigs
all those types of regular ones that you
can buy out for like any other vendor
but she does include a large selection
of these braided units which are popping
now as far as this one guys it's a lace
frontal in the front and it is the mesh
dome cap in the back as far as the lace
front he'll go she did bleach the
frontal and I'm pretty sure she does
that for most of the units so she
bleached the frontal and she also did at
extra baby hairs on top for me now if
you look on her Instagram this here this
wig is actually on there but there are
like blonde streaks in it so I asked her
to just to just do this to straight
black just cuz I'm like really boring
and I just wanted to make sure that was
perfect so I got this all black and I
also got extra baby hairs on this one
now the reason why I got this one on
extra baby hairs is because if you look
very close to the braiding pattern up
here there's not enough space here to
kind of create like a natural hairline
so I wanted to actually customize it
myself so having her send me one that
had a lot of baby hairs I was able to
cut I was able to cut the lace off and
leave a good amount of lace so therefore
I could put powder on that lace glue it
down and then have the baby it's kind of
mesh through with this so it would kind
of look realistic sometimes I'll see
other people on Instagram with these
types of
and they just kind of like just dropped
it it's just they don't really plan or
try to make you look as realistic I try
to do my I did my best with this one it
is a lot of baby hair so I'll probably
have to go back in and kind of thin it
out more and the video I showed you guys
I used my little eyebrow blade to kind
of thin the baby here's I'll just
because they're a little bit extra so
what I'll probably end up doing guys is
going in and just kind of thinning them
out a little bit so they're not just so
heavy in this area but I do like the
little swig goals I did the transition
into the parting space looks really good
now it is bleached you could obviously
that some parts are bleached actually
here I try to put a little bit of part
of I don't think I really linen any good
powder here but she did bleach it it
looks really realistic initially when I
put it I was like damn this looks really
good now as far as a cap construction
I'll show you guys to the cap looks like
she basically did individual braids in
the back and kind of sewed it on the cap
which is kind of cool this is really
really pretty guys from the tip to the
from the root to the end so the tips
it's like perfectly braided and in my
head I'm like you have to be like really
skills to sit there and how to braid
something like that because this Robin
took a long time to create but she did a
very good job on this one guys I
actually really like it one thing I did
notice about this unit though guys I
feel like it's a little bit humpy right
here and I don't know if it's because
the cap or maybe I need to add combs in
it or something like that but I just
kind of feel like there's like a little
mountain right here which I'm kind of
like a little bit thrown off about and I
asked my sister my sister was like yeah
it's a little bit humpy here but other
than that she thought it was a pretty
sufficient wing but I don't know if it's
because I don't know I don't know if
it's because I don't put combs in it or
something like that but there is like a
little bit of a slope here and one thing
I want to mention she did actually
connect some of these up here so
basically it's braided up into hair and
then there's up into here is braided
flat and then she added the box braids
starting about right here so therefore
you'll see like a lot of box raised in
the back and then this part is the only
part that's flat I'm not sure how the
hairstyle goes on someone's natural head
when they're getting it done but I feel
like this was actually a little bit more
detailed I don't know she probably could
have just went all the way back and did
it but I'm not the expert it came out
good anyway so I'm really you know I'm
just happy I got it and it looks good
but perhaps if she would have went a
little bit further back
flatten the braid out all the way
through here and what happened so humpy
up here so I don't know what I'm gonna
do either out so what I can actually do
is sew the braids together really
tightly back here so therefore it
doesn't move one good thing about the
back though you can't really see the cap
so therefore you can usually like swing
the hair and all that and you won't see
the black cap showing she kind of spaced
the hair out perfectly so therefore
there's no gaps or any junctions in
between so you won't be able to see the
cap which I thought was good so like I
said what I probably end up doing
another thing about that is just going
in and sewing this down so that
therefore it's a little bit flat cuz I
probably just rock it in this hairstyle
I tie it back in a ponytail or I'll
probably just wear it let's see let's
see if it
all right probably and I can just
probably just wear it like this
but I really think that I should go in
and just kind of so this section
together and if I saw this section
together guys it will just be like
legitimately a pop in AF wig so yeah and
even this side right here you'll see
that this side kind of lifts a little
bit so even if she kind of took this
bring these braids and carried them all
the way back a little bit flatter a bit
flat but this is not an issue that I
feel like is a big issue all I'm gonna
do guys is just go in and kind of like
sew these down together all at once and
kind of make a nice clean sole line so
you won't be able to see it so I do
think that this wig is cute they have
this nice cute blonde one kind of like
that Kim K one that she was wearing that
she said was Bo Jackson braids or
whatever they do have one like that I
want to try it blonde I think blonde
would be kind of cute too it's like a
mixed blonde so it's like black and
blonde blackened 27 so I probably try
something else like that if you guys
want to see more units like this on my
channel guys definitely if your comments
down below I actually really like this
and I think it's going to be poppin for
the summer and I cannot wait to frickin
wear this guy's so I'm really thankful
that this company some of this with to
review keep it honest reviews for you
guys honest opinions about it I think
it's a good wig they're pressed pretty
well at this website if you wanna what
if you're able to wait for the package
to come in I would say purchase it and
just kind of you know wait it's not a
really big job when you get the wig
you're not going to do a lot of crazy
stuff and when you order make sure you
specify it to her exactly how you want
if you want extra baby years
you could customize it yourself or if
you want like particular color and stuff
like that she's very nice and she would
definitely comment be accommodated to
anyone so definitely guys email her
inbox her I will leave her Instagram in
the video and I'll leave her Instagram
down below on the specs on this baby
right here guys
