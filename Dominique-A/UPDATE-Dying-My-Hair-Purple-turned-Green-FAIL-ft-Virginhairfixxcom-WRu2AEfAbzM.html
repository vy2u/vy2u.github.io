with another hair update so this hair
that I'm sporting today guys is from
virgin hair fix so I will link the video
up here if you guys remember when I did
the initial video on this and the hair
was black so I did ask you guys what
kind of call you guys thought I should
dye his hair so the whole census was to
diet purple which I did attempt to do
but this is the kind of weird color that
I ended up with so let me explain how
this went down so basically I had to
bleach the hair anyways initially to get
the color so what I do is I use the
prism light purple powder so purple one
it's the bleaching powder and I use 40
volume developer now if you know prism
wise prism lights is the type of
bleaching powder that gives you
highlights and lowlights so if your do
if you're trying to go in blonde ombre
or bali eyes or something like that i
highly recommend using prism lights just
because it gives you a broad dimension
of highlighted looks especially and
going from black to blonde so that's one
thing to keep in mind when you're
depleting here in general guys so I use
that and I kind of do like ombre body
hair style um bleach process with this
one just because I didn't want the color
to be all over I want it to be kind of
like sporadically through the wig but
eventually I just which is please show
thing after like most of it is pretty
much bleached guys I only left kind of
like some dark ruining at the top part
but like 90% of it is bleach basically
so I used that and I processed the
bleach for about 30 minutes
and then I washed it out the hair color
the bleach process was very nice guys I
kind of should have just stopped right
there and just toned the hair like I
usually do but I wanted to kind of do
color just because I don't really do
color so I mmm should've just kept it
that way so then I used a door and I
used 3 bucks 300 bottles on my door and
I'll link it down below and I'll link in
the video for you guys so don't remember
off the top of my head so I used those
now keep in mind guys this hair dyes
semi-permanent so in my head I'm
thinking like if I bleach the hair this
thing is about to catch this color real
quick this is what you guys need to know
semi-permanent guys and it's not the
strongest thing ever it wasn't strong
enough to hold this hair down guys
honestly and this is exactly why I
turned out like this
and I'll tell you why I turned out like
this now what I should have done guys is
used medic panic I've used manic
in the past and Manic Panic works when I
mean excellent it works so freakin good
but Manic Panic is ten dollars and
nobody's trying to spend 10 dollars on
one little bottle here die when you can
get a bottle here that for four dollars
and fifty nine four thousand forty nine
cents at the beauty supply store of the
adorn so I was trying to be cheap
cutting corners so I just got the door
and the door just did not work so I
saturated the entire unit with the three
bottles of door maybe I should've got
six bottles maybe actually like seven
but I got three thinking that it was
gonna work
like I mentioned in my last video this
hair is not super thick guys it's very
nice and light so therefore I didn't
feel like I needed that much hair dye on
it to soak up the color so whatever so I
saturated the unit like completely guys
and when I tell you this here didn't get
an inch of purple in it it didn't even
get a tad bit of purple in it I didn't
get any bit of purple in it the only
part that the purple was relevant in was
a closure and that's it so my idea when
I saw the wig I was like I'm not I'm not
gonna come up on here with this review
like it's just gonna be a mess so guys
what I ended up doing was pressing the
hair a second so what I did guys was I
went back and I bleached the hair a
second time now the hair still did have
like a little hue of purple in it so
when I bleached it the second time this
is the color that the hair developed
into and while I was bleaching and I was
noticing that the hair was turning green
and turquoise and I was like oh maybe
maybe it's just just a cast over maybe
that's not the real color because
initially my idea was thinking that if I
bleach it it'll ship the entire like
purple hue I'll and I'll go back to like
a blond color guys do not do that
because I did that and look what
happened so I'm not listen I'm not mad
it's a learning process guys I was
taking it I was attempting it and trying
to see if I would kind of get something
different so this is a call that I got
and it's just all over the place so
basically some parts you see like a
light green then you'll see a turquoise
what I'm going to say is the closure
took the bleaching process entirely
excellent like the bleach for the coat I
don't know it's I feel like with a lot
of companies the closures bleach it
faster than the bundles do I don't know
if I'm the only one that feels that way
but I've noticed out a lot of the units
that I've created in custom created or
whatever the closure or the frontal
takes the bleach way faster than the
bundles do so this one took this closure
took the bleach like so nicely so
obviously you'll see the front part here
with the closure is that it's a little
bit more a brighter turquoise er
turquois er more turquoise and it's just
more vibrant and actually like the fact
that it's in the front so on the front
you'll see more turquoise and then
you'll kind of see the transition in the
back it's kind of like a green mix
turquoise and then towards the ends
you'll get like a hunter green color
which I think it's actually pretty cute
so it's kind of like a mix of like a
mossy green mermaid styled unit it's
like really mixed colors and you know
what guys I'm not mad at this at all
like I think it's fun if I have an
outdoor concert to go to this summer
something nice and fun like some like
fun little activities this summer and
you know you could just wear like a nice
fun little hairstyles put some like put
a braid in it maybe like a little
headband or something tribal I think it
would be cute so these are just ideas
I'm throwing out like if you make
mistakes when it comes to bleaching your
hair and dyeing your hair do not just
run away from the situation there's
always ways to rectify the situation by
making it look nice
adding touches to it so I'm definitely
looking to finding some fun little
tribal headbands maybe like some little
like feathered pieces and stuff like
that and try to make it look more fun
and nice but I do like the color like I
said guys if you have a deep waver
definitely if you have a deep waver
utilize that deep waver if you don't
have a deep waver you guys already know
deep waving to me just really transforms
the hair if it's a bad weave it's a bad
hairstyle it's a bad color job just
adding a little bit of argan oil in a
deep waving style on it just brings the
hair to another level even if I curl one
this hair or curled it in general or
just be like fabulous AF so I'm not
really like upset at the unit at all so
that basically wraps up this video I
hope you guys enjoyed my update my hair
coloring style whatever I'm sure some of
you guys hate it but listen up sometimes
you got to do what you got to do this is
what I ended up with and like I said
this is a Learning Channel so when you
make mistakes you gotta find a ways to
fix it and just deal with it so I hope
you guys like this don't forget to
