basically doing a video right now about
my foundation routine and my concealer
routine so I'm just gonna get into it
from a look that I left off on and it
was just basically me putting my lashes
in my eyeliner my wing to the eyeliner I
already come basically based my eyes off
and did my eyebrows this morning but I
just wanted to start on this because I
get a lot of courses on my concealer and
stuff so therefore I want to show you
guys what I use this foundation and
concealer so the concealer i'm using is
Revlon Photoready concealer number six
and is deep and this is Revlon
Photoready it's like a medium color
so basically mines is down to the rim
and I can't even like twist it anymore
because I didn't twist it all I could so
what I do is I use like a little
concealer brush and I just dig it in
excuse me guys and I get as much
concealer I want
there's actually two shades maybe three
shades out of than my skin color but I
like it like that
BAM like that and then I just blend it
in
I'm gonna use my mirror I usually use my
hands cuz I feel like my hands is a
little bit better to blend in
I know some people do their makeup
differently this is the way I've been
doing mines for a while now but I do
take comments and tips or whatever if
you guys have any tips I will take them
I know it looks like strikingly like
crazy right now but once I let my
foundation everything together the look
will come out more softer looking this
part looks cray
okay so that's how the concealer looks
like I know it's like striking right now
but I will show you guys how I give it
to decrease her look so that's how the
concealer dispersed so what I do now is
take a nice little brush fan but not fan
but it's like a little Kabuki brush like
this my guys is from Walmart I use the
foundation Maybelline New York gene
Neutron airflow foundation and this is
in the color 360 light cocoa
I don't conceal the little marks on my
face because they don't really appear
like when I put foundation so I just use
a little bit like this and I start off
over here
and I a priest fee only use one pop
I only use one pump because I don't
really need that much as skin as you can
see right now it's already clearing up
and like I said the concealer blends
along with the dose stop nicosia fading
off re one pop of this is just enough
and I love this foundation it just makes
the skin look so pretty
you see how shiny like like rich my skin
looks now okay so after you're done
blending away what I do now is take my
my loose swab my loose powder and it's
medium color number two it's just
translucent powder and I take another
concealer brush which is a bit thicker
like that and I just put a little bit of
this translucent powder underneath so my
concealer will not crease all the
concealer creasing is
you see how that blends like really
nicely
put it right here - just because there's
this really gets oily
don't just hit every part and that's
complete so what I do now is put my
bronzer on and this is the bronzer I got
and it's called shimmer Rimmel London I
got this for six bucks on my harming
store and I just take a little brush and
I just fan it on
you should see the difference right
there
they look at guys we're gonna look so
cool okay so what I do know is I'm gonna
finish my eye look and what I'm going to
use is Maybelline New York to find a
line and this is in black and I just put
this on my lower lash line so feel
better
just like that and if you do have a look
at a little bit of mess up let's make
sure you clean that up go back with a
little bit of translucent powder over
underneath it so you could clean it up
and make it look pretty
okay so then I want to take my mascara
again my mascara and this is NYC's curl
curl whatever I don't know let me just
go underneath and put a little bit
mascara on my lower lashes sorry I came
like halfway between the show I couldn't
show you guys how I do my eyes but it's
really simple and I will do very light
that I was going to see but I was more
interested in doing a foundation routine
instead
okay and last but not least I go back
into my tear duct just to make it shine
and I use my shady hip wait what is this
anyways who freaking knows L'Oreal's hip
hip dual and this is the shady shady
8:36 and I like this taupe looking color
which is right here and I've been
killing it with the brown it's my
favorite color so you get a little bit
of that on a brush you just put that
right hand to my tear duct it's really
subtle
but it makes your eyes pop even though
it's really quickly set up okay and if
I'm not mistaken I believe that's it
unless you wanna well as my effect that
is not it
one last thing I like to do is put a
little blush and the blush I'm gonna be
using is black opal black radiance is
Blake baked blush and it's like a color
like this and the color is warm berries
838 305 they get this on a brush put it
right there
and I also mix this one with elves elves
like else
studio blush and this is the color right
here it's like a dusty little pink I
know it's like really light for my skin
but you just put a little bit on it
because that's like these cute spark
goes out I like
and that she's gonna do my concealer
foundation and blush and a little bit of
eyeliner routine and this is a look I'm
wearing today hope you guys liked it and
I do wear lip gloss sometimes I don't
wear lip gloss if anything I'll just get
my little u.s. bum and I put out my lips
and I'm good to go so thank you guys for
watching this video if you have any
questions or comments leave them down
below and this is basically what I what
my look is like every day - the blush I
don't really wear blush that much but
you know hey why not
I could show you guys what it looks like
on me today so thank you guys so much
