I'm stopping by today to do a quick
review I would send a wig by a company
called unibytes.com to do a review on
and the way that I have on today is the
way the name of this wig is named of 14
inches and it's a curly indian remy lace
front wig the style number is l 0 0 27
and it's the quality one and the
purchase price on this unit is 239,000
89 cents the color that I got this unit
in is the color 8 light brown and as you
guys can tell this is the walk and who
check out my instagram you probably
already saw me post pictures of the unit
um I was waiting for this unit to come
in and I was like oh my god when this
one is coming in um the comp the
company's owner Linda contacted me
through my youtube channel to make to
ask me fall into this video and I gladly
accepted she's been very nice throughout
this whole experience and she's such a
sweetheart if you decide to order from
this company make sure you inbox her if
you have any questions about the unit
she customizes the wigs also so make
sure you email her before you make your
purchase to make sure you get exactly
what you want ok so the wig came in a
really cute box it came through US
postal mail and they brought you the
regular brown box and then you get the
wig box this is the wig box that it came
in and it's a really cool wig box I love
how the companies are so into themselves
and how they you know you know broadcast
their products I mean this is a really
nice box and its really well-constructed
box or whatever it's pretty you know
what I mean um the unit itself is
actually really good to him you can see
it on my head this is how he came fold
it up and ready to come um she also sent
me three free gifts and even if you
purchase it not just because I got it I
got me Fergus anyone who buys did they
get three free gifts and the free gifts
that I actually received was a wig stand
which came with this really cool thing
and I could use this one really a lot I
got a free brush and I also got a
weaving cap with cool mesh and this is
the one I actually have underneath my
wig cap
not as you speak um Linda is really nice
like I said guys it took about shipping
takes about five to nine days so if
you're very impatient about shipping
make sure that you expedite the shipping
so you can get a little bit faster but
five to nine days is the standard
shipping time um the unit itself is
constructed as a lace front like I said
before and as you can tell has like four
inches of parting space that goes all
the way right about here um I did tweak
this a lot when I got the unit the unit
was this color completely through even
the part everything so you really
couldn't see where the parting spot one
was that I had to make the part you know
more visible so what I did was I added
mascara do not judge me guys I added
mascara and I had a dark eye shadow to
the root part right here and I
translucent powder and all the way back
to make sure the part looks a little bit
more natural and then I what I did after
i had in the mascara and the brown and
black eyeshadow i used the aussies in
sit freeze and I spray this on the part
so that the part could stay really nice
and if you wipe your hands off it will
not even come off so it's there
permanently so it looks more natural it
looks as if the hair my roots are
growing in so this looks realistic and
like I said in my previous videos I
wanted a curly hair cell for the
summertime so that it could be natural
looking and really pretty and this is
very nice and I when I first got the wig
and I saw the color I was just like what
the hell this isn't this just to light
and you guys know that I'm dark skinned
ah well I'm dark I'm not dark dark skin
but I'm a woman of darker skin
complexion so for me to wear blonde hair
is all it's always a risky not I'm
saying so this was another risky move
for me if you guys watch my last video I
had the blunt hombre which was oh my god
I love that here I probably do that
hairstyle again but um that was a risky
risky hairstyle for me um and I was able
to pull it off to my best ability so I
feel like this is another risky
hairstyle but I love this hair it's so
nice it's oh and you know what it's a
nice length it's like 14 inches and it's
not to life like if it was like
down here it would just be way too much
this is like perfect length hair like
this is so nice and so it's not too big
it's just like it's like a decent like
volume it's like really I do guys see
the part I like skill this like so well
like sometimes when you get units you
have to customize it here to your liking
and for this type of unit i had to
customize it to make it look as
realistic as possible so i'm proud of
myself for that um enough about that ok
I saw the wig like I said has four
inches of parting space right here I
showed you guys words that you can part
it just about anywhere i actually just
see you won't even see the part in that
way that's why you have to adjust you
have to kind of like um darken the roots
a little bit just make it the way you
want it to be you know you always have
to customize something to your liking um
it also has adjustable straps and like I
said before this unit is a size medium
cap and the medial cap is a little bit
big I thought it was going to fit a
little bit snug on my head but I my head
is kind of small should have got a size
small cap so but it does come with
adjustable straps and I just basically
put the adjustable straps to that so the
furthest furthers like width so that I
could be tighter and I didn't put any
bobby pins or anything I just popped it
on my head and I did put that little
mesh cap on it just to secure my head so
that's basically it guys um and if you
want to buy which from this website
they're a little bit pricey but like i
said i like to hear a lot i haven't had
a unit like this in a long time so for
the mink get for the first time in a
long time that i'm getting unit like
this it's really good I kind of Miss
having lace front wigs the excitement of
just putting something on your head and
being and like just leaving is really
cool it's really easy and it's like such
a convenient way of like styling your
hair no matter what um I did co wash
your hair and I'll show you guys what I
used to co wash the hair really quickly
I use the energizing passionfruit guava
from organics and I also mixed it with
the home one and only argan oil and I
put these together and just ran it
through the hair I wet the hair first
I put this products on and then I let it
sit for like 10 minutes in a plastic bag
just to soak in a little bit and then I
washed it and while he was on wet I
sprayed it with a little bit of the john
frieda frizz-ease um I only had like
this much in here so I put water in it
and then I also added the supreme
styling and setting lotion and it also
just to give the hair a little bit of
bounce and as you guys can see it has
more than enough bounce for everyone so
this is the final look of the hair I
probably will die this here in the next
two weeks just like I told you guys
before and two more of a red color I
feel like red with this hair would just
be like oh my god unbelievably high so
i'm going to plan i plan on dying this
hair red in two weeks so um thank you
