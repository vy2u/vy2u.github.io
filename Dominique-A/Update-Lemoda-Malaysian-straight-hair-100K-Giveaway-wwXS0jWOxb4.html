video on the lead motor here from
Aliexpress now this here was originally
called a li motor this hair company but
they switch over to the motor but they
do have the same exact products so I was
sent four bundles of 28 inch air and a
20 inch frontal and I will leave the
link for that video up here somewhere
for you guys so you guys can click that
video so basically what I've done with
this hair is I've colored it jet-black I
use the Revlon color silks black color
for this look and I use about three
boxes I kind of felt like I should have
used four boxes just because I kind of
really saturated the hair really got it
to that deep black look but I will do
that again later when I co wash this
hair after I just died again so you guys
will see it in my other try on haul
videos and stuff and I feature it again
so just look out for that so and what I
also did was deep wave the hair now the
hair did come straight but I did like I
liked it straight but I felt like
because it was so long it was
unmanageable Strait just because I'm
very particular and my hair was getting
caught and stuff my hair got caught in
the nurses cart like and stuff like that
was just kind of like oh it's too much
so I was like you know what let me just
do a free-flowing hair style that's not
gonna need a lot of attention cuz when
you have straight here you're always
worrying about the hair being my kind of
matted or kind of like not so like
really staticky and not pin straight and
I'm like a pin straight type of person
so I was like really like watching it
all the time so I decided to deep leave
it just to give myself a free-flowing
look that was kind of like natural and
just kind of norm one free so I didn't
really have to worry about touching it
letting it kind of you know do its own
thing so that's why I deep waved it and
I will insert a video up here when I
deep wave my hair I love deep wave it's
an easy hairstyle looks good and it's
fabulous so um that's what I did now
this hair is really good guys it does
have a nice luster it doesn't really
tangle let me see let me see no it
doesn't really tangle that much it does
shed just a little bit but when I've
been shedding I don't mean like long
strands shot long strand shedding I mean
kind of like little clippings of the
ends will just come off and duh it does
maintain its length so I have not lost
any length from this one so it's super
super
long and basically sits in my lap when
I'm sitting down and this is deep wave
when it's straight illegitimate Lee
sitting in my lap so if you're looking
for some fabulous long long hair highly
recommend purchasing this one I don't
really have to do much to it I co washed
it maybe twice since I've had Anna had
it for about like three weeks or a month
so I've only watched it twice and it's
just been pretty much normal I did go
and play with the baby hairs around the
perimeter the perimeter of the frontal
is actually really good so I just played
around with the baby here is that the
got to be gluing kind of gave it in my
own jazz so it looks very realistic
people are like yo is that your hair no
one the same my hair about whatever but
