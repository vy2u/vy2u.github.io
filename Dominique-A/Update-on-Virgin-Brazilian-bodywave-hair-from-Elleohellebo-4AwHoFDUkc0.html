a quick update on his hair if you watch
my previous video before I did a show in
tal vez hair and this is the hair from a
company called LOL boutique I have a
16-inch closure a 22 inch bundle 20-inch
10 to 24 inch window and this is a
virgin brazilian body wave hair i
technically have this here in for about
22 23 weeks something like this will
make it three weeks I didn't do an
update video the first week because I
wanted to leave the hearing for a while
so I can actually give you guys a better
review on the hair instead of just tell
you the first week oh my god I love it
there's a lot of pros and cons about
this hair but there's more pros about
this here we're going to start with the
pros the hair curls very nicely it holds
a curl like the curl holds like for like
three days later you'll still have that
like kind of curl at the end um then
also straightens bone straight and as
you guys can tell the hair is bone
straight and it also i use deep waivers
lab you guys know I like too deep with
my hair the deep wave the style last for
days and days and days it just has that
fullness and the other thing I like
about this here it has a really nice
shine and texture it um it makes kind of
like african-american hair just slightly
has like a nice texture to it in a nice
Sheen and it's very soft I get minimal
tangling with this hair the hair is very
long guy so therefore you might get a
little bit of tangling towards the ends
in the back because you're not really
worried about the back here you know the
front hair is on finger so you're
basically fixing this one more often
than the back hair so that's why the
only thing you'll get is like a little
bit of tangling towards the back but not
the Nate battle I don't get tangling in
the nape area um some cons about the
hair I do get I in the beginning when i
first installed the hair i installed the
hair on my head I just had a full sulman
with the closure um I didn't call
washing it when I first got and didn't
silhouettes so therefore I I believe
that's why I started getting shedding
because once I co wash the hair and I
still the West I got no shedding well
not no shedding but I got minimal
shedding maybe like one or two strands
and I straighten my hair and that's it
before I was getting long strands and
strands and everything everywhere on my
bathroom floor so I'm like what the hell
so I never see what's on here and I
sometimes I don't even co-washing when i
first get it so I
to try that this time any words so make
sure that when you get your hair make
sure any version here not only the
virgin here from LOL booty but make sure
when you get any type of virgin here co
wash that hair before you put it in
because there's dead hair on that web so
it wants to come off so as soon as you
put it on you start trying to manipulate
the hair touching and curling and doing
that stuff the hairs in the shed so make
sure you co watch and still the web
spread before you want to install the
hand and that's basically like all the
problems i got but what I did do after i
did cohosh stay here in silhouettes i
decided to do a u part wig instead i
never really made it you part way before
but you know i'm on youtube so i'm
watching like thousand videos a day and
I'm like I need to figure something else
out and I just wanted to give my hair a
break I still have the braid pattern
underneath my head from the last so in
so when I do I said just take this off
and put on my mannequin head and just I
keep it moving but this is better
because it just leaves it here I don't
have to sleep on my hair and mess it up
and get it all tingly the next day I can
just style it on my way my mannequin
head put it down for the night and the
wake up the next morning just put it on
and just fix any problems I have and
it's easier because you can style it and
curl it and then just put on the next
day and be gone with it you know I'm
saying it's so easy so that's what I
decided to do this time just to UM kind
of like minimize the time spent doing my
hair in the morning it's just a little
bit easier like that and I did the u
part wig with the closure so I attached
it on the cap and everything and Jessica
tell it looks really it's pretty flat
the cloture looks really good guys on my
typical seal on the closure um and
everything is pretty flat all the way
back the hair like I said a super long
when I was getting the shedding I had a
little bit of a dilemma and I decided
that because I was getting some shedding
I kind of feel like this jenny was
coming from the 24 inch so what I
decided to do is I went out to a local
not a local store once it's the city i'm
in Connecticut so I want all the way to
manhattan
I went to this like really an iceberg
hair store where they sell it the other
version here and a lot of um right here
and I decided to go out and buy some
remy here I only bought this pack in
here because I'm familiar with that the
local beauty supply store that I have in
my town so I decided to go out and buy
this envelope here and I'm not sure if
you guys are familiar with this one but
I've seen us out a lot of beauty supply
stores and it's really nice here and
I've seen reviews on it so I decided to
buy this here just to add into the back
of my hair because I kind of felt like
it was standing on a little bit so this
right here is the inches 22 to 24 and
it's a natural body wave in its natural
black so this is virgin here so this
hair can be dyed along with my other
here and as you can tell you can't even
tell the difference the hair looks
exactly the same as the other hand
showed you guys before it's the same
thing so that is the even better plus so
I'm not really good I don't really have
to try to make it match it matches and
it was the same exact texture so um when
I get about eighty dollars for this
bundle and it came with like two little
bundles on each side so I put this in so
now I have four bottles in here have won
21 22 and 2 24 and a 16 inch closer so
right now my head is like really really
full um and i will show you guys what
the how long the hair is from the front
so this is what the hair looks like from
the front the hair is like super super
long guys when I mean long I mean super
super long it's like really really
really really really really long guys
but if you guys can decide to see the
texture is really really nice and this
is like the 16 inch closer right here so
the 16 inch is pretty long I did kind of
put some ladies on this side puts it
when you curl you want the layers to be
towards that way but like I said guys
are here is like super long this is what
they consider 24 inch I consider this
like a 26 28 inch it's really long and
I'm 56 so that's kind of like a lot but
um so far so good i love this hair guys
I'm i will keep you guys posted i'll
probably do some hair styling like some
curls or some deep waving because I you
know I love my teeth wave but that's
about all that's about it guys um so
