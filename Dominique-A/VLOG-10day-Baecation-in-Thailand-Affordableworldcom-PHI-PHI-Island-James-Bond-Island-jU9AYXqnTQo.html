made it to Ty Lee and I'm super stoked
right now if you guys hear the TV in the
background Scott playing so I could see
what's going on out here
my boyfriend is actually in the shower
so you guys will see him a little bit
later we basically just kind of like do
this stuff down and kind of like just
like let's take a shower and get ready
so obviously I got ready first
as far as tonight goes guys we're not
gonna do that much you're probably just
gonna go get dinner and then go to sky
bar which is kind of that like a lot of
sky bars around here which are really
popular so a private go tank a sky bar
something like that so I did do this
little beat face and I used some morphe
palette and I never ever thought I was
gonna get my hands on a morphe palette
so I went to Alton saw that they had it
so I got the three the 352 palette 350
350 to 3502 palette so I got this
palette and guys like the colors are
like mmm yeah and you guys know I'm not
really a shadow person so I was testing
the waters out today so it is 91 degrees
right now in Bangkok so it's kind of
like hot humid they actually had rain
like had like a little rain
thunderstorms in the last few days so
they said that it might persist onto
today but we're not really we really
don't care about that we just went to go
have fun so we're probably gonna just
hang out and then go to this half dinner
and then go to the sky bar and we have a
great view guys I'm gonna show you guys
the view looks like so you guys can see
it it's like amazing from the hotel room
hotel room is pretty nice too and I'll
show you guys a tour of it but I wanted
to say hi before I kind of get all into
this tour or this vlog for you guys so
I'm really excited it's definitely a
very different change if you live in New
York City or if you live in like
California Los Angeles and you've been
to like big cities you know I'm saying
you will actually be able to kind of
remember or kind of like it almost looks
like New York City to me so it's kind of
like not a culture shock like me and my
boyfriend were kind of like oh okay you
know we kind of you know we dig it cuz
you know Brooklyn like I'm from
Connecticut but you know what I mean so
we're just kind of like oh it kind of
looks like New York so it really has a
Newark vibe but it's like really like
busy like extra busy busier than New
York which is kind of a shocker for
someone who lives in the United States
but yeah
so guys I will catch you guys a little
bit later but I'm gonna show you guys
what the room looks like and the great
view
evening everyone
so it is 220 right now in Thailand which
means that by the time you watch this
video it'll be 220 us time which is
afternoon and we RAM so it's like a 12
hour difference it's not like it's a 12
hour difference well no it wouldn't be 2
o'clock Eastern Time and then if you
live in California know that kind of
stuff over at the Times New Orleans
never at a time you know what I mean so
we actually went and got some really
good curry initiative vlog that part I
had some red curry shrimp it was really
good at just like a little restaurant so
definitely the food out here I would say
like starting off is really good I'm not
gonna lie
it was spicy and I was really good and
then we came back we had like some wine
and then we kind of like took a nap it
was the plane ride the first day I don't
expect to do like a lot of stuff because
that jet lag is serious we actually made
it up until like 10 o'clock no up until
I think 9 o'clock so that's really good
we actually made it far because we could
have just knocked that when I got to the
hotel but we actually made it far
tomorrow we have a whole bunch of
excursions which I'm gonna bring my
camera on I'm gonna block all the
excursions and stuff like that so you
guys will get to see like a lot of stuff
it's freakin amazing here I just
straight off the bat really beautiful
it's like really nice like it reminds me
almost of New York like I said before
it's like a really nice fast pace fast
speed type of area it's really good on
food like this place is really properly
for food and stuff like that so
definitely have to taste everything so
we went to 7-Eleven which is next door
to our hotel it had an ice cream and
this little mini bag of Pringles and
some wine because we need to wake up
early tomorrow and it's 2 o'clock an
island we cannot go to sleep because I
think we're still sleeping or still
sitting on the idea of us Thai being the
afternoon now so we're not tired yet so
we're gonna try to go to sleep maybe the
wine will induce isn't to sleep and then
we're gonna wake up tomorrow and we're
gonna wake up in a few hours because we
need to get ready to go to the temple
cuz we're gonna go to the temple just
take pictures and stuff I can see the
Buddha and all that stuff so hopefully
we can get up by like six cuz you know I
got it takes me some time to get ready
I already pick my life but I was very
basic let me tell you guys is hot as I
don't know what outside my first wig the
long black one swelled up so that one
I'm just dropping that one for the rest
of this trip it's just too straight here
for this type of weather it's not gonna
work that black wig swelled up can't do
it so I have one I have the blonde one
left I have a short curly one left and
then have the big curly one left so
we're gonna see how well those three do
the blonde one I'll probably save that
for for Phuket or I might wear the
blonde when Tamar just to rule it out to
make sure that it actually is good if
that one swells up as well it's lights
out for them and that one's not gonna
make the cut either so I'm starting to
think that maybe this type of weather
you should probably wear curly wigs or
kind of like loose wave wigs because the
texture is natural it'll stay that way
you don't have to worry about that stuff
so mm-hmm don't try to come out here
with no straight here that straight here
is going to swell up so yeah so I'll
catch you guys in the morning and you
guys just keep enjoying this vlog
[Laughter]
that's it's a flower market yes yes it's
a flower market
yeah my plan is to put this country
everywhere you will see yeah a lot of
the lucky things
yeah capita and spirit how's your video
does flower for showing respect for
prayer for bringing good luck yes even a
Valentine days also in the state of our
very expensive yeah normally in backpack
like at around 50 baht just one flower
rose flower just one a hundred pound
different right yeah you see this is the
main flower but no time to walk here
no parking launch nothing we just look
and see from here if you want to take a
picture even in the temple everywhere
you can take a picture some area can't
ya take a picture I will let you know
and after his tempo already and then
your favorite code and Buddha tempo
he recorded Buddha temple after : buddha
temple sure yummy yummy yummy yummy
that's included in the package yeah
after that in the afternoon
we after we have Plan B directly true
now it's becoming
because we'd be in position
and hot season
mr. smart this is
we have because not too much but is my
idea
babe
oh these are really nice I'm weird like
that I like stuff like this
drink all the way gone
this is what's doctor
some goodies
how does her snake experience me she's
great you know conquered the world feel
like a new man Mike when I was a kid I
could talk to animals so when I grabbed
the snake
what told him relax yeah he had a great
talk with them yeah mm-hmm cannot
conquer God
today was rather eventful you guys
obviously saw the footage it was good
really what are you doing creeping in
the background like that so when we get
back to the hotel we're gonna have like
a nice chitchat with you guys I'm gonna
be really sad when I leave here but I'm
gonna really devastated somebody in the
back I'm gonna be really devastating
nothing closing guys you see this poser
yeah when we get back to the hotel we'll
tell you guys well this is day 3 we have
like we have five more days but we have
one more wait no this is yet day three
we have five more days here no fine we
have one more day here this day today
and then tomorrow and then we go to
Phuket for four days and I'm gonna I'm
gonna I'm Michael I'm gonna be really
sad when I leave here it's I love it you
guys definitely need to come to Thailand
it was great next trip will be um next
trip I didn't okay he didn't think that
far it was just probably because he
doesn't think there's a future with
now he's doing a cockroach she did look
banjo in a cockroach
did you guys on your face okay you don't
want to spill okay here we go next
just as a side note guys me and my
boyfriend went out with another couple
that was part of affordable world tour
with us and we went to a ping pong show
aka ping pong show if you don't know
what that is google it it's crazy in
Thailand so we went to that and when we
went there we all got a beer which was
like 140 baht which is like three or
four dollars u.s. they tried to charge
us 7 thousand baht for just sitting down
and not even for like five minutes and
we didn't even watch the show they tried
to fight us in there like brought the
manager out there madamn out my
boyfriend and the other guy from the
couple he was just not having it my
boyfriend and they were just not having
it so we ended up paying for the beers
and laughs but just be careful when you
go to certain places because people will
definitely try to bamboozle you people
tried us at this one and we're not
having it but it's really crazy out
there I do love the culture just be very
careful when you're going especially if
you're American cuz they're gonna
definitely try to take advantage of you
and try to get that but don't really
want to come and do too much talking
because I know I'm boring you guys to
death sometimes and I talk too much
and excuse all the stuff in the
background luggage just like feels open
and we're actually trying to get ready
now to move to Phuket so we've been in
Bangkok for like four days now so now
the next spot we're going to is a pool
camp which is more like beachy island
vibes and stuff like that so I'm really
excited about that because I really want
to go to the beach I want to go swimming
I just want to feel the water and the
sand so that's mainly something that I'm
really trying to get into but last night
was crazy I didn't really film too much
of last night just because I was a
little bit and it was it got really
crazy so if you never come to Bangkok
there's a lot of underlying things that
happen on here that I don't know if
people really talk about that but there
are a lot of different things out here
so stuffy
it's not like your regular city in the
United States guys are big city in the
United States this definitely has a
different vibe there's different rules
and stuff like that here and the thing
about it is like they're really like
religious out here but some of the
practices that
and nothing against Thai people or
nothing against I love the culture I
love the place but there it's a very
sexual place out here I'm just gonna put
that out there and have you been to
Bangkok before you know what I'm talking
about it's pretty cool those dopes it's
a cool place to go I'm really gonna miss
it
it is very fast paced out here and
people are trying to get there but out
here that's what you you know they're
trying to get these coins out here so I
wanted to show you guys the baht anyway
so for every US dollar like one dollar
is equal to like 31 but depending on
where you go and get your cat and you
exchange your money I used I went to one
place that had a higher but exchange so
one US dollar for me was 31 but was 31
but so basically an entire meal is worth
a dollar here so you really really get
you know a lot for your dollar for it
look literally your buck so that's one
good thing about here so I just want to
show you guys so this is like a 20
dollar but right here it's green I don't
know who that person is on on it but I
guess it's somewhat important to them
maybe I need to do my research here's
$100 baht which is pretty cool as well -
wait somebody's knocking at the door
alright guys sorry that was a
housekeeping they came to see if we
already cleaned up but we are not
because we're still kind of packing
getting our stuff together because we're
leaving like I said so um one thing I
want to mention guys about this place
it's a little bit different from the
United States guys now I enter I came
across some situations yesterday when we
went out to the dinner crews that were
kind of like bothering me the entire
night now for the dinner cruise guys it
was set up and like a lot of people went
it's probably like maybe like at least
100 120 people that got on the boat now
the thing that was really frustrating
for me for the party uh for the party
the dinner cruise was that I you know I
wanted to get dressed up I got dressed
up went out there you know had my wig on
makeups and everything like that I
wanted to be really cute me and my honey
got dressed up and went out now the
thing that was annoying to me guys is I
understand like like maybe it's a
culture it's a culture shock for some
people that live here because they don't
really see and I'm not trying to point
things out like this I'm not trying to
sound you know trying to make it seem
like oh you know they've seen black
people before but honestly I don't
really think they see that many black
people here which is okay
but you know there are there were a lot
of other black people that came to visit
this place and vacation which I feel
like is okay to do you can do whatever
you want so I don't know why everyone
was is just kind of like what the hell
it's there so um the Thai people really
cool out here they don't make it a big
deal that me you know with me and my
boyfriend now there are other people
that came to visit this place from other
Asian countries that actually were not
as nice as we expected which is kind of
weird so um when we went to the dinner
cruise or whatever it became one of
those awkward moments for me and it's
just I'm just like in the United States
I'm not like that because in the u.s.
it's like if you see a girl with like a
certain body type it's not a big deal
you're just kind of like oh whatever
she's you know that is what she looks
like whatever so when we went to the
dinner cruise last night he got orange
study-buddy Becca cone she got the
ticket and the Sun was gone Hassan was
gone oh my god this is really good well
my subscribers about our interaction
with people that were pointing me out or
the crowd well anyways that guy saying I
don't under I don't know no but we saw
are there black people here right we saw
that Oh a few a handful wasn't ten but
it was it was a good amount which is but
like I said strike I'm trying to explain
something it's not it's not about that
you can travel everyone you're gonna go
on vacation wherever you want I don't
know if the people out here just don't
and it's not even the Thai people that's
the thing they're really cool nobody was
making a big deal out of anything like I
kind of felt like it was other travelers
that were here and I'm not like I'm just
saying I'm not trying
the offensive aerials of other Asian
travelers that were making big deals
like legitimately every single person
that passed me tap their friend a family
member a friend and pointed me out and
they weren't even pointing me out like
pointing it out like is it like oh look
at her she pointed me from the front
they were pointing at my butt like oh
look at her ass look at her ass like who
does like that like I just don't
get that like I honestly I honestly
wouldn't I do that to somebody like
that's awkward as like even if
you're even if you're like in America
you do that but you'll be like everyone
in America they kind of appreciate like
if somebody who has a big brother like
over a ceasefire or whatever like no big
deal but they're not tapping all the
they're not tapping their grandmother
are they they're not tapping
their grandmother saying to the
grandmother oh grandma look at look at
this girl then these people are it was
just too much it was it was getting on
my nerves like honestly it was
so annoying like I thought I felt like
that was like like a freakin like freak
show or something like that that kind of
almost ruined my night intially I like
we started talking to the couple at the
table it almost ruined my night like I
was already going like down I was like
oh you know what we should have never
came I should have just went back to the
hotel I was almost to that point I'm
wanting to go back I was so annoyed but
we made it through though and then we
went out last night and last night was
pretty friggin it was it was pretty epic
stop
I do you copy fats are here I know how
do you warm it up those Ellen electric
electric goes to Bad's bro so we're
going to move the pool slide speech

great experience today y'all the dinner
of this restaurant was amazing
I'm a little time and I think it's at a
couple of drinks and I don't know why I
couldn't handle this I couldn't handle
it today look at this guy yeah already

good I had salmon and they put like the
crispy skins on top of mashed potatoes

appetizer we shared like a seafood
noodles and it was really really good

Bond tour and I will actually film that
one for you guys because I know you guys
but I want to see that for some of you

say come with family like kids and
somebody I just you guys
it can be a little different we going to
the Bangkok to Phuket but we just do
like an island
that's probably family there are people
out here right now I'm poke at with
their family members and their children
but if you're gonna do Bangkok to Phuket
I would say maybe like a couples boat
all boys all girls type of shrimp
honeymoon or not even honeymoon like
bachelorette party bachelor party that
would actually be really good for this
just like the hangover but I'm we're
enjoying it we're gonna watch a movie

I'm like I'm always blocking the camera

footage when we get there I don't want

not everybody wants to listen to me the
entire time talking about nonsense so I
just wanted to say hi
wait stay tuned why do I feel it
everything is going by so fast just okay
I see you guys
okay
that means it there that means that it
was encounter oh yeah
that's dirty that was enough of a
problem somebody had to make a stick so
many people took it on the boat you
gotta make a sticker

wig mm-hmm and the dress isn't is so
cute and this is like one of those what

outfit hold it like that
that's it that's a fit that's a fit
so much all right guys we'll catch you
guys later after we turn up okay
mmm-hmm advertisers screaming I think my
review of this would be very similar to
the sort of fingers that we have in
America sour cream in 1980
these are bit more
I'm not describing tastes quite quite
accurately but um a bit more chippy get
out of here with this
you
friend so it's a last day that we're
here and we're sitting you beats that
one this lucky shot we're gonna do this
thing it's super hot on here bro say hi
bean
oh that's not funny she's living her
best life just like yeah it's super hot
on here guys like you I'm already got
tan my contact just won't but there's
really not that many people here these
are the beautiful orange tiles they gave
us me and BAE had to move because back
there the Sun was beaming back there so
you wanted to move closer where we can
get like a nice umbrella setting so now
we're like what we're cooling right you
know move it you're over I feel your arm
is in the side just an FYI for the ones
that are coming and I think they're
about to come out here we're beat faces
all the time that does not work I did it
a few times and a few times I felt
pretty much the beat face just does not
work like it's just way too high it's
like 95 degrees on here I was going back
to low tide I wanted to go in when I was
high time yeah but I'll show you guys
the water after and stuff like that but
it's pretty much a relaxing day our
flight leaves we have to leave here at 9
o'clock our flight leaves at 1 o'clock
in the morning 1:45 in the morning and
so basically we're just chillin until we
got to get in the bus and go back to the
airport and wait for the whole transfer
situation
I'm not honestly and truly I love the
whole traveling process are getting on
the plane and transferring plane to
plane it's annoying that's I feel like
that was the worst part the whole trip
the whole plane ride transfer stuff was
just absolutely a nightmare nightmare
nightmare nightmare nightmare just
terrible terrible terrible so I mean
whatever just gonna go back home like
this
and we get to see Pablo he probably
misses us he's probably so sad when he
probably hit that door he's gonna be so
excited to see us yeah so this is what
I'm looking like in the flesh before yob
like she went out there every single day
wearing makeup
no that wasn't happening it's too hot
but I've already caught tans
it always looks like you got your
eyebrows waxed but not really so attend
you could you guys can see it
and yeah so enjoyed myself I'm sad that
it's over but I will be in London in
France and 68 days so I will see some of
you guys if I decide to do like maybe
like a meet-and-greet somewhere in
London or somewhere in France I probably
just do like a little gathering or let
you guys know a few date like maybe like
a day or two before I meet you guys in
that area so I can meet some of you guys
in London in France but that's 60 day 68
days away and then we're supposed to go

bit later and I know this one's gonna
come out like pretty long but I wanted
you guys to see as much as you guys can
