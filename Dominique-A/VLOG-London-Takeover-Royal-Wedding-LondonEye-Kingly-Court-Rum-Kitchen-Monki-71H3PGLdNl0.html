that we finally made it
so this vlog is starting a little bit
late into the day just because we
actually end up taking a nap because we
were really tired jet lag so what we're
doing now it's about like 7 o'clock here
so we got ready because we're going to
go out tonight so I kind of like did my
makeup just preparing for tonight and
then we're just gonna go to Oxford
Street now because I have to pick up a
memory card we also have to get like the
adapters cuz we forgot to the adapters
for our phone so we need to get the
adapters as well
oh it's loud outside Wow let me turn the
button down but I will show you how that
the hotel room looks like tomorrow
morning just because it got dark and we
kind of ran out of time so um they
actually ended up giving us us junior
suite and they gave us one bed and then
they have a pull-out couch but me and
Danny we're gonna cuddle tonight
together so we're just going to keep it
that way it's a pretty decent sized bed
and we're watching the wedding
they got me what's her name Megan and
Megan in here we got married and the
wedding was cute her dress is cute she's
beautiful that girl is like she's top of
the line she's really pretty so we're
gonna do now is go out and get like
something to eat we had like a weird
experience with a restaurant nearby it
was just it was it wasn't that good
and I don't really eat that much anyway
so like I was really excited about that
salad and just didn't cut it for me so
we're gonna go find something else see
probably and then come back and then
find a parties or something somewhere to
go so yeah so we're probably gonna go
out tonight which is Saturday night in
London and see what's poppin at the club
so we're going to go get stuff come back
turn up a little bit and I'll let you
guys know how it goes alright guys so
we're going to Oxford Street we're gonna
go check out stuff and then come back to
get ready for the out we still have to
find a party I think that's all one but
they're like all 18 and older I'm bowled
sauce everywhere awesome look at Dan she
got browsing so waiting for that hungry
to come and then we're going down guys
yeah I think my makeup lift is very
chinky well look at look at that belly
bingo man bingo belly a big big girl
belly
there's evidence she cannot even hang
right now we're trying to have a small
cocktail
she can't even finish the drink bro it's
upsetting time come on dia come on get
serious bro guys we're having it's black
red label with a diet coke yo I said
dance bras guys look up she never chips
I don't know because I never realized
she doesn't have eyebrows so I made her
in her own Center eyebrows like don't
they look so cute she kind of looks like
me on the low on the low very very low
so this is my fit guys it's some cute
little disco pants you know waist coming
in and whatever and I got some heels on
and this shirt but this shiny stuff is
before I was like a really cool plunger
but the shirt was actually too big for
me now so I'm basically wearing it like
closed up but I think you like this cool
necklace set from this company called
love styles and it's kind of like the
Jesus piece and one part goes down into
the breast so obviously it goes down
into there so it's a really cool Jesus
piece thing whatever but I think that
outfit is nice I got these jeans from
Mac rag and these are actually sizing
medium pair of pants but they're
stretchy and I don't I just like the fit
dancing and cute you got like some disco
pants on crop top and a leather and I
don't have a jacket she wants to show
you guys her cake was looking a little
flat no pants to make you know explain
those pants is give you like a flat
Ridge like it's weird so I also got the
bob on you know I have a longer hair
earlier but I took it off cuz I didn't
wanna I want to emphasize more of the
jewelry aspect of this outfit so I took
that part off but I think this is pretty
cute you know body coming through you
see don't see wait wait yep yeah see
ways oh okay wait wait wait y'all see
that
okay so a waist is coming through no
plastic surgery waist training so I'll
let you guys know about that but we're
about to go along I'll try to film some
of the parts I was going out but not too
much of it what is she doing
so I'll try to film some parts of us
going out but not a lot of it just
because I don't even know what that
right up the night life is like here but
I did put something on in snapchat or
Instagram and someone did give me a
suggestion so I'm gonna go to Ace Hotel
out here and see what their rooftop is
like and then everything that's like a
four three four so I'll probably go
somewhere ask them to come back to the
hotel so I will catch you guys later
say bye then later
okay guys so it's like later and we like
taking all and makeup off we have our
jammies on
so my pajamas are actually from Primark
so I will do a video on that she got the
primer goings on too so we went to like
this little bar but we don't even know
the name of the bar but everyone - but
like our our main objective to come here
was just to enjoy the scenery enjoy
their like site sightsee and stuff like
that
so we weren't kind of like Oh dong ho
about like you know like let's go to the
club and get it poppin no so whatever we
went to it wasn't that poppin but you
know the experience was fun you know we
have the experience to go downtown and
you know have like a little bit of fun
there was a lot of thing you know it's
funny like we are going on stages are
kind of like over at this point cuz I'm
27 she's 26 so it's kind of like we
don't go out like that anymore so
there's like in the clubs in London
start from 18 and over so it's kind of
like you really have to decipher which
kind of you gonna go to because you're
gonna end up hanging out with like a lot
of kids so there's a lot of young kids
in there and there's a lot of Bo and
stuff like that there's a lot of Bo and
it's just kind of like wet and I'm not
there's nothing against I mean like
maybe some people just forget to put
deodorant on before they walk out the
house no there's no not a big magazines
not a big deal but it was just a lot of
bees alone it was just a lot of Bo and
stuff like that which is like just kind
of threw us the off so we had
pretty much we have a good it was an
experience it's all about the experience
guys don't think you're gonna go out
somewhere and have high expectations are
you gonna go out somewhere you're gonna
turn up get party party with your girls
and stuff like that we don't have high
expectations coming here so we're coming
here just to enjoy stuff yeah it was
what it was it was bad but it just
wasn't like what - like especially if
you come from New York or you come from
Connecticut whatever it is even if
Connecticut's not that popping but if
you're used to traveling to New York to
party and stuff like that New York
versus London is completely different
and if you live in New York you know
exactly I'm talking about and if you've
been to London you know exactly what I'm
talking about it's two completely
different worlds and because I'm like in
New York all the time
I know
so it's just two different worlds but
like I said it's all about the
experience don't come out here thinking
you want to get it poppin like like
right now like on the on point like it's
not gonna happen like that so just come
on for the experience enjoy sight see
you know look at stuff examine stuff and
stuff like that overall was good we got
free drinks was great ladies don't you
don't need to wear heels yeah it's all
about trainers out here so a lot no
offence am I trying to be offensive
because I have a lot of UK followers but
a lot of the clubs I went to a lot of
the people had trainers on and we were
heels thinking that I was that trainers
or sneakers
yeah trainers are seekers so a lot of
people came my hair with like trainers
on and we were like what the hell why
could it came out my freakin converse
sneakers on if I knew it was that case
but I guess we didn't look out like that
and by the way we're not drunk neither
one of us is drunk we're just like real
chill right now so yeah it was fun
the experience is great like like I said
tomorrow we have like other stuff to do
so tomorrow we're going to go to
London's I wears as long as I mm-hmm
yeah we're gonna go to London - aye
tomorrow and then we're gonna do like
some we're gonna go to Oxford Street and
stuff like that so I've loved most of
that and you guys will see that just to
let you guys know right now this will be
2 this will be a double vlog so there'll
be a vlog of London and longer a vlog of
Paris as well so I'm gonna split it up
so you guys can kind of get like all the
idea like all the thoughts and you know
from each place instead of kind of
making it one vlog so hope you guys like
that why don't you say on my arm you
have like two patches on your face with
like two old done yeah cuz I use some
micellar water and they made my face
super drawing oh it might around here is
really dry some real action I was like a
different person

seven hours people whatever kind of
sleep that was nothing
I feel like a little bit of like that
sore throat now do you want to sort that
just feel like a little bit of a I don't
know stiff kind of like I feel like like
sluggish idle come on back to suit I
don't care I wait about one
to London I and do a Oxford Street
subway right now Dom can do like really
jittery and sleepy I'm always so we got
on our way to go shopping and then we're
gonna go to the London Eye dancing hi to
everyone
hey guys so it's I'm still we're still
look really tired so we're adjusting to
the time a little bit so that's why
we're like a little bit late on time
today but we got ready and do you bring
the gloss no I didn't bring it so yeah
so this is today's outfit I have the
dress on from hot Miami styles you guys
remember this from my blog and I'd like
some sneakers with it so it's pretty
basic I think it's cute and the hair is
from why wigs comments a bundle with the
6x6
closure so yeah so we're just waiting
for our uber now and yeah say something
Dan okay never mind she can't figure
that out
but it's a pretty nice day outside today
yeah it's like 69 degrees so it's really
nice so you came out glam today I was
glam yesterday too wasn't I
no I didn't want to wear this wig out
last night because I thought it was too
much but I wore it out today in today's
like a regular day as well so it's kind
of like glam today too
I don't know alright guys I think I need
to fix my camera because if something
happened to my camera it's not really
working like it's not focusing the way
it should be focusing so I need to fix
this before I like I actually could film
some parts on the camera but it's not
really working as well as should be
right now which kind of sucks it's just
not autofocusing at the moment so I need
to fix that so empty stream and that
that we were gonna watch to see what
we're talking about we need to find this
place
but three minute walk
there's a co-ed hola
all right guys
hope you guys can see everything it's
really nice out here
it
I having fun dude yeah it's really
pretty okay so down this one alright
guys we're gonna get to this restaurant
I'll show you guys what we get to eat
it's really pretty out here and it's
really nice by the way
what is his spear somebody's got wedding
so we are we actually walked from the
London Eye
why don't we caught it uber and then
we're walking out to the Buckingham
Palace so we're approaching it enough
you guys don't remember yesterday was
the wedding which was Saturday Sunday
today so yesterday was a wedding so we
actually walked over here to see how
beautiful the Buckingham Palace is guys
it's nice so I'm a turn around and show
you go I'm gonna turn the camera and
show you guys everything that has to
offer
you
good evening everyone so we are back at
the hotel room so there's actually the
bathroom you know prepping her curls for
the next few days and I'm just sitting
here trying to charge the phone of my
fat die completely in the middle of
other diseases today today was actually
a really good day by the way we did a
lot of stuff today got a lot
accomplished we went to see the London
Eye but we also went to Buckingham
Palace and we also went shopping so we
went to Oxford Street but I felt like we
didn't get we won't like to eat and
stuff like that and kind of like kind of
like surfed around and like look that
stuff but we honestly didn't get to
really shop and I wanted to shop so
we're gonna go back tomorrow after we
come back from Warner Brothers I Harry
Potter theme park or whatever their
little studio so after we go to that
we're gonna go back to Oxford Street and
do some shopping we went to Monkey today
I bought some stuff from them and new
look I didn't know new look I you know I
didn't put that two and two together
that they had a new look here so they
have new look here and it like thus we
went inside they have so many nice stuff
I'm probably gonna end up coming back
from my trip and doing a haul just
because I'm buying stuff here and I did
buy some stuff prior to leaving so I
probably like a collective home and
probably like showing you guys I've got
a lot of stuff or maybe I'll show you
guys just a haul of stuff I bought when
I was in London in Paris so you guys can
kind of get like travellers look a
travellers trying to I guess whatever
but everything went really well we did
eat dinner we had fish and chips at
Poppy's it was pretty good the only
thing about it is there's a look a
little bit off about seasoning here like
I don't know if they don't season the
batter they don't see that season the
fish I don't know how it is but maybe
America is just really over processed
with their food and stuff like that we
season a lot of stuff and that's why
we're so fat but you know I mean it is
what it is I just kind of feel like
they're a little off with the seasoning
but the food has been pretty decent so
far the first day was terrible the food
was gross the first no the first day
that one meal is terrible after that we
gradually you know you know became
better and better and better but today
was good I enjoyed the food today we
went to what is that place we went to an
Oxford rums kitchen their food was
actually excellent days like I had um
red snapper with plantain it was really
really good guys like it was excellent
and definitely check out rooms kitchen
when you come on it's like poppin yeah
but one thing me and my sister were
talking about that's kind of like it's a
little bit off subject but not really
like I don't know if we're in like a
different area I mean I don't know if
we're in an area that's not really like
you know populated like you know like
that like that or if it's a popular area
was just kind of like oh there's a lot
of expensive stuff in this area I don't
I don't know but we haven't really seen
like you know are people like that much
like I expect when I came out to us you
know people of my color like not trying
to make it a race thing or whatever and
just saying like we really didn't see
that many black people you're like we're
like looking like okay are we gonna see
somebody else you know like us not
really and it's crazy because it's
really touristy here so you would expect
to see you know other black people or
even people that live here a lot but we
don't see anybody we like to see like a
hands hand let's sprinkle or whatever of
them and that's it it wouldn't it's not
popular but when we do go out last night
we did see a lot but like I feel like
the area we're in right now we're not
really seeing people like us which is
kind of strange because London and New
York are almost kind of the same concept
but New York is very it's like it's
diverse AF like diverse like crazy
diverse like I don't know I love I love
New York but like when here in New York
it's like a melting pot like like
serious melting pot but I kind of feel
like here since I don't know if we're in
the touristy area or if it's just not
the area where you know a lot of you
know minorities populate we just don't
see anybody like us so we just kind of
found that weird if you live in London
just let us know down below what that is
because we just don't we're confused I
guess you can say if you come to
Connecticut and you come to my town I'll
probably kind of be the same but it's
different because London is actually
pretty big so you would expect to see a
diversity like right in the middle of
everything but we just don't see that so
I don't know leave your comments down
below if you can like explain that to me
or you kind of have like a thought about
why that's bad but other than that it's
a beautiful place guys we enjoy we're
enjoying it like so much tomorrow we
have more to do so I'll show you guys
more just to let you guys know I'm gonna
split this vlog two ways because it's
gonna be too much to overload in one
video we do we're doing a lot in London
and a lot in pairs so I'm gonna make
this two vlogs so I hope you guys enjoy
it and I hope you guys enjoy today so I
will catch you guys in the a.m. and we
will go
see the Harry Potter you know theme
whatever it is is a dance
Harry Potter steel yeah Harry Potter
studio I'll catch you guys in the
morning
Oh
you
so we got our butter beer
it's a little bit smooth it's so there's
aa mystery
and then I got a sandwich but I'm not
gonna stop in the bread I'm just going
to eat the bottom all right
it's like children patty
hopefully second
so this is what mines it said
is sour and sour
the evidence
let me move you guys close
say yes and see
I mean sour
alright guys so this is my standard size
I'm just saying if the bottom part
instead of eating all the bread
low cards
that time one is hard and I needed a
toaster so forget
we need to find somebody
but rather me
yeah for me
that was enough
this is okay
you know I like to light us that lettuce
tastes like that shredder lies
my friend
dan Lexus but it's too sweet
they put like some type of caramel
on top of it down I'm not really into
my suit is okay
I know guys look at ro boozy eating on
us
but I don't really eat the bread like I
was getting it like that
we don't need these parts
laughter
mix around
the password balloons are exceptional
southerner
you saw them
now we flip the whole thing
our bus driver to actually tell us it's
okay to go and legitimately it would
take us five minutes if we were running
to get around this entire studio to see
most of the other stuff so we're
basically done and we have a two hours
left before we're departing so we're
crossing our fingers that they let us
like leave soon or like at least decide
to pack up soon because I honestly
actually it was amazing it was a
beautiful place but I'm ready to go
shopping
honestly and truly and it takes at least
an hour to get back to London like scent
like middle I want to come apart London
is that what is it Victoria central I
don't know so we have to get back there
to Victoria Station and hopefully they
could drop us off at Oxford Street so we
can go back and do a little shopping I
definitely wanna go do that again but
we're out here waiting it wasn't amazing
guys honestly and truly I love Harry
Potter and and if any of you guys follow
me you guys already know it's been my
child's it was my childhood like like
childhood memory like it was one
important factor in my childhood so I
loved it yeah so we're just waiting but
the park was great you guys should come
visit if you're in London if you live
here you've never been here go here and
if you're visiting London in general
I've been making a fact to make this
part of your trip because it was great
because I didn't get the opportunity to
show you guys what it looks like so this
is the bed that we got and it's like
whoa what is it 20 I'm pushing and we
split it with that one little that you
see that pillow right there we split the
bed with that pillow so she couldn't
come to my Center I could have come to
her thank God here's our takeaways that
we had um so this is a mini fridge
the little mini bar was nothing in here
we got it we had to put our own stuff in
here which is I guess okay the tea was
good I'm probably gonna grab this
pomegranate went to go and see the
English breakfast seriously once a week
- and get with it this is the seating
area of TV here the view was pretty good
like it's nice in the morning to wake up
go to a table to get ready and I have
like a shower in here
the showers nice very pretty
yeah double sinks with double manners
and stuff like that so we're going to
get us some souvenirs because at this
point we're going to Paris guys so we're
not going to be here anymore
thank you so much London so we're going
to Paris and we'll be in Paris I got
three o'clock we have like a dinner
cruise or something to go to say hi
again all right so that's great guys so
we are at the airport right now and
we're getting something to eat before we
depart we actually got here like two or
three hours early and the flight to
Paris is still be like an hour so we've
been waiting we're gonna be our friends
at 125 it's like 11:35 now so we're
getting something to eat looking at
other people's plates
we're not really excited about this cuz
it's not looking good
hopefully this tastes good cuz we are
like we really ate out here because some
of the stuff just wasn't up to par no
offence but yeah so we're gonna get this
meal in and
yeah just on say thank you to London I
