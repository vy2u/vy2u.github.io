three after my surgery so I've just been
doing a lot of stuff so yesterday I had
a wig sale like I said to you guys in
the previous vlog I had a wig sale
yesterday and then today I went to go
get a peel box and start sending some
stuff out so I will send this stuff on a
Monday everything's packed in my car
just have to go finish the paper for the
peel box so like I said to you guys this
is when the peel box is open I'll leave
the peel box under my description bar
box if you guys are interested in like
sending me things or whatever I know I
should have had one a long time ago but
I just like I don't like a lot of things
going on so it was perfect time since
I'm like out of commission right now I'm
just home but I got a lot of stuff done
I did a video yesterday for
transformation Tuesday and I actually
did an entire transformation Tuesday on
some announced my cousin now the reason
why I did that is because a lot of
people
I especially start to sell some of my
units I don't want you guys to buy to
think that if the unit looks like that
on me then it's gonna look like that on
you or that you guys are thinking that
like oh it's not gonna look like that so
I showed you guys let it look like on
someone else I did the baby here is
everything glued down the whole entire
nine yards so it actually came out
really nice and she looking really nice
after and she was very happy so I want
to do I'm putting that video up on
Tuesday because I want to show you guys
um kind of like the waves on other
people and see how I stand on other
people and how it looks so that you guys
are more confident when you're
purchasing stuff so you guys aren't like
oh well it looks like that on Dom and
it's not gonna look like that on me yes
it will look like that on you so I mean
like just just watch the video on
Tuesday you guys will be very pleased I
told you that I'm gonna start doing
transformation Tuesday videos because it
makes sense for me to review wigs with
other people in it instead of it just
being myself because you guys need to
see what it looks like on other people
other than me and like I said this is
Learning Channel so it makes sense to do
that on my Learning Channel
so as far as today I'm not taking any
narcotics today I the last time I took a
narcotic was yesterday it was like in
the afternoon just cuz I was getting
real tight so I took my shower today and
that's why I'm late vlogging today
because I was being so lazy this morning
so I took a shower today I took the
bandage off of the nipple area so the
only thing that I have on the nipple
areas of steri-strips and the
I have inside stitches will touch will
dissolve because I had to get a cola
capsulotomy so I have inside stitches
inside my breasts and outside you can
open the door in outside as well too so
I have I took off the dressing all
around my nipples and I also took off
the pads so basically I'm just sitting
in my shirt that I went on a surgery day
so I'm just basically sitting with the
actual bra on so let me just show you
guys so I showed you guys yesterday like
so I just have the bra on today and yeah
so I actually looked at them
I'm really excited like it really
proportion my body out tremendously and
I'm sorry there's like no light in here
I just didn't turn anything on so I'm
like more proportionate now and I just
they look so good guys like and the
funny thing about that they don't hurt
so if I want to start the massages
myself which I'm not going to because
he's gonna tell me to start the massage
on Wednesday but I can squeeze them
together I can like they touch them they
are real like they aren't big like like
I can't even like I used to be able to
like look on the side and see like my
like hip I like see a mountain when I
turn to the side I can just see my
breasts I feel like they look they just
they just look way they just look this
is just what I wanted so I'm really
really happy and I'm happy that I did
this like I'm so happy so that's about
it like I said I took the antibodies
this morning supposed to take one every
12 hours so I took one this morning with
a protein shake and some eggs I have not
had a bowel movement yet and I don't
think that's cool and it's not cool cuz
that's three days and I haven't had a
bowel movement so I'm gonna have to get
some milk of magnetic us
I actually I think I have some here I
don't have to drink some milk a Mac or
some citracal because I need to use the
bathroom and since I've become a
pescetarian if you guys don't know that
I don't eat meat haven't eaten meat in
like six months
so I have since I've started that
lifestyle change I use the bathroom
every day because I eat more
I need like a lot of fiber now since I
don't eat me so me not using the
bathroom is kind of weird for me because
I usually use the bathroom every single
day so I'm definitely gonna have to get
something to like initiate the the bowel
movement because that's just not good
and my stomach is looking a little bit
stuck it's looking a little bit fluff
right now so I know I need to use it
but I'm looking at my stomach I'm like
wait I'm not usually this fluffy in that
area so I'm a little bit stuff right now
so I'm gonna have to get something later
so I can induce the bowel movement
because you don't want to be backed up
for too many days so this is day three
so I'm gonna initiate it today so I can
use the bathroom but other than that I'm
good
like I said the only bag the only sucky
thing is sleeping you can't sleep on you
can't sleep on your stomach your side
you have to sleep upright which are head
up in like an upright position which is
annoying so what I've been using is the
travel of neck roll thing to support me
so I sleep on it like I'm like every
morning I wake up I'm like like Dowson
drool so it's just something to get used
to but it was nice to take a shower
today and get clean so I'm happy about
that so I'm gonna eat some of this
shrimp from Popeyes and a biscuit
lemonade red beans and rice and some
mashed potatoes and I will catch you
guys a little bit later and I'll let you
guys know how I'm doing so the vlog will
go up around 5 o'clock today and this
I'm not it's just a straight to vlog and
you guys will see I showed you guys in
the vlog like what the boobs look like
after and you guys know if you guys want
to see my old vlogs and I first got
breast implants in 2015 yes and check
those videos out it'll be helpful so you
guys can see the size difference but
obviously I'm gonna do it after the for
the two week update I'm gonna do like a
whole sit down and talk to you about it
but I kind of feel like I'm okay not to
do like videos so probably tomorrow I'll
be back on my video game like usual so
yeah so I'll cut you guys a little bit
later guys so it is late right now and
I'm only up right now because I took a
nap so okay like a little bit of tie
right now but I posted that vlog up
today and a lot of you guys were really
supportive I'm I'm not surprised because
this procedure that I had by god I have
already gotten it done before so you
guys already know like even before my
boobs 650 now I was 350 before I've
already had breast implants so it's not
like I'm just showing up in front of you
guys say oh guess what I made a decision
today saying I'm gonna get breast
implants today and I already had them so
this
like the fact that some people just felt
like they had to say something and most
of the people that do comment it's
usually guys it's kind of strange but I
don't care you could say whatever you
want it is what it is
but I do think everyone who supports me
and who were saying really nice things
because oh like I'm really transferring
it is what it is like I'm not gonna come
on here lie to you guys it's kind of
like dumb fake stuff if I do that I will
do a video obviously so dumb videos like
to talk to you guys about the whole
process and stuff and like I did say to
you guys previously the pain level for
me is really non-existent
it's basically what I got it done on
Thursday Friday's is day two when I'm
fine so the first time I'm not gonna lie
the first time was terrible and like I
said the first time I got breast
implants was like three years ago three
or four years ago and I was completely
flat so they had to stretch me a lot so
they stretched me to 350 the first time
I got stretch to 650 this time however
it is I do feel this stretch this time
but it's not as bad as the first time
the only part of my boobs that hurts is
a nipple area just where the incisions
at that's the part that's a little sore
it's more store my left side versus my
right side but it's nothing that I can't
handle I have not taken any of my
narcotics today I'm fine I kind of have
that leg off the anesthesia headache and
now which is kind of weird it's a little
bit late into the two days later to have
that like when you come off anesthesia
are you usually end up having like this
little headache I'm just having like a
little headache now but I'm not
interested in taking anything just
because I really don't take pills like
that anyways like like not really so I'm
just gonna be fine I think a little bit
of rest would be good I did take a nap
and afternoon I was just tired and I
posted up the vlog today and what else
did I do
mmm that's about it um tomorrow I'm
probably gonna get up and go out my
sister she's so nice to me taking care
of me bringing me my snacks and stuff
she bought me a yogurt and remember I
told you guys that I was eating yogurt
because when you take the antibiotics
you got to make sure you have a backup
yogurt helps cuz you do not want to get
stuck at a yeast infection that's like
the worst ever so definitely get
yourself like some Greek yogurt or any
yogurt that has a good it has bacteria
if it has good bacteria that will
prevent you from getting a yeast
infection so I mentioned that before so
as
playing Chobani the Greek yogurts have a
lot of the bacteria so I would recommend
using like a lot of the Greek yogurts
yeah so I have my yogurt it's late I
needed a snack like I was in my house
like wow and go for some fries right now
but we all know that's not gonna work I
won't give you guys a video about the
21-day challenge that I'm doing so the
20 like I saw people left comments in
last vlog I'm not trying to lose weight
like that's the thing I'm just trying to
kind of like work out like get like nice
tone and like tone my body up am i
trying to look like 30 pounds absolutely
not
am i trying to kind of like lose some
fat maybe I'm trying to do some fat and
tone up my body so even if I lost 10
pounds it would probably look like I
didn't because I kind of like got my
arms like nice and tone-tone my stomach
a little bit I started around my legs
and butts just do some squats and stuff
like that but as far as me losing weight
that's not on the agenda for me I'm
pretty happy with the way I am now I
just want to work out build a better
lifestyle like I mentioned I do not eat
meat I haven't eaten me in like in like
six months now so I've changed my diet
completely and it is different because
I'm not as tired anymore and I have more
energy but I really need to work on
building like like good meals so that
I'm not always eating like fries or like
junk stuff like that I do eat a lot of
beans though I'm like a real beanie
person now but I'm gonna do this 21-day
challenge thing and I will do an initial
video on the 21-day challenge I'm gonna
record that video probably on Monday
because that's when the challenge starts
so I'll give you guys all the breakdown
of the information and to where I file a
challenge from and stuff like that so
I'm gonna try to record that tomorrow if
I can get up and have the strength if I
do not then I will let you guys know but
I'm doing the 21-day challenge I did
tell you guys I'm traveling a lot so I'm
traveling y'all I got a lot of things
that are happening so hmm so I'm
traveling to New Orleans in February
then I'm going to Thailand in March and
then I'm going to Europe and um run to
Europe in May and then I believe I'm
going to Miami and like June or July and
then I'm going to Disneyland in
California for Christmas so I have like
a travel year and like I planned my
stuff that way just because I don't
really let go
and stuff like that I don't really do
like a lot of like things like that for
myself like like buy things for myself
that much because a lot of the stuff
that I do get like I do fashion videos
hair videos so you get kind of like
products so I really don't get the
opportunity to spend money on myself
that much guys if I wanna buy something
up our body for one pair of sneakers and
that's like the most randomest thing
I'll buy but I really don't get to enjoy
myself too much
so I usually kind of treat myself with
trips and stuff like that and maybe some
new boobs but I usually save a lot of my
money so like well a good portion of my
salary for my work and stuff like that
I pretty much save all my money so I
have some money that I wanted to say so
I was like you know I'll take in and
just go on a few trips this year and
stuff like that because I don't really
buy myself anything so you guys will see
a lot wow it's gonna be great guys and I
noticed that you guys said that you guys
like me vlogging so I probably do vlogs
obviously once I'm out of this position
right here then I can get in and do like
some good vlogs so I'll have like a
little cramp in my boob oh I get like
little sporadic cramps guys with these
bad boys here I got a cramp on the level
and you know what's the worst part it's
the way I'm sleeping like sleeping like
this upright and it's terrible like my
back hurts I'm getting like a boob cramp
ha but yeah so I have a lot of things
going around guys so I'm gonna keep you
guys in the loop I'm really enjoying
this y'all 2018 is starting off pretty
good I have not used the bathroom yet
but I'm probably gonna go like I know
this is a TMI I'm probably gonna go sit
on the toilet and try to see if I could
produce something I tried to get my
mother to bring me something she didn't
do that my sister she was being lazy and
wanna go get me anything so I'm pretty
much stuck here but tomorrow I will be
in a car and out and about cuz I have is
having like their pancake thing so
they're like oh let's go have pancakes
tomorrow so I'm like alright I'm gonna
go with y'all but don't expect me to put
a wig on or nothin I'm going out with
like an oversized top hopefully nobody
like elbows me or like dings me like ha
that would be like the worst ever so
hopefully no one does that and yeah so
I'm gonna do that tomorrow and
I think I could produce a BM tonight
this is TMI I'm so sorry guys don't try
to keep it real but honestly you have to
make sure your your all your systems are
back to normal after being under
anesthesia you did that's just how it is
I'm sorry I have to say that but yeah
I'm gonna um yeah I'm gonna go and make
proper use a bathroom with you try so I
can produce something and if not
tomorrow definitely gonna hit myself
with some laxative it's like a producer
because my stomach is really really fat
right now and it's usually not that
large so I know I'm a little backed up
it's gonna go on day three so I really
gotta take care of that you have like a
cramp I cannot sleep like that tonight
my chest is starting to hurt now just
because it's like a weird position to
sleep and like oh so I need to find a
different position a way to sleep
tonight because I'm catching like a
little cramp in my chest alright guys so
that's about it I will catch you guys in
the morning tomorrow I'm probably gonna
wake up a little bit earlier than usual
I don't go back to work to Tuesday and
I'm gonna go back to work cuz I'm fine
so I do have to go and get my scrubs
cleaned up cuz I don't really know where
my scrubs I don't know where that I just
gotta organize them I do started a job

gonna go use the bathroom finish up my
yogurt and watch some funny mukbang
videos my friends were telling me before
I go my friends were saying that I
should do mukbang videos like DOM eats
or like cuz like I'm a real foodie type
of person which you guys don't know even
though I don't eat meat per se I do like
a lot of seafood and stuff like that and
I'm really like a big boil person I like
seafood boils and things like that one
of my favorite places to go to to eat
like seafood born in the East Coast is a
boil in NYC I don't know if you if you
know what I'm talking about leave a
comment down below and when I see in New
York they have something called the boil
oh my god I go that's like that's like
date night for me and me and my
boyfriend we go there all the time it's
just like legitimately like the best
thing ever
so I don't know they're saying like
maybe just do like a Dom eats I'm a
foodie person guys even though I don't
eat meat and I'm a pescetarian I'm not a
vegetarian I still need that kick of
something but eventually I probably
become a vegetarian
not vegan can't do plant base it's just
weird so um yeah so I don't know what do
you guys think about that just leave
your comments down below so I'll catch
you guys tomorrow
it is 11:14 and I'm being dragged out
the house because they want to go eat
pancakes at SIA
yay here's Danny driving thank gosh you
take my car so we're going to uh you
took my car this morning we're going to
IHOP now they dragged me out I'm feeling
really good today guys like I said this
is practically a piece of cake walk in
the park for me and I'm not saying that
because I don't want you guys to think
like I look like I do it's gonna be a
walk in the park too but it really is a
walk in the park I'm like totally good
so we're gonna go to IHOP I'm not really
an IHOP person but they have some
pancake special going on
um other than their pancakes like
they're regular fool like their eggs and
stuff like that aren't pretty gross it's
just they don't cook it right so I'm not
gonna be entertaining any of that I'm
just gonna get like two little pancakes
and call it a day
this is like really blocky then I'm
starting this 21-day challenge things so
we have to go to the grocery store and
pick up some groceries for the 21-day
challenge
we're gonna go to Costco so I'll bring
you guys along with me and I'm also
gonna go to the hair store today so I'm
gonna show you guys like the things that
people pick up from the hair store I'm
gonna try to actually bleach my not
someone asked me about that so I'm gonna
do a talk through a video on how I
bleach my knots because I think that's
important since I do everything else I
might as well show you guys that so I'm
gonna bleach my knots and I'm gonna do a
talk to the video on how to bleach your
knots and hopefully it's not a failed
video I'm hoping that it's a win video
and then I'm probably gonna die some
hair make a wig since I have some time
like I have low energy I'm really tired
and just to mention I did use a bathroom
yesterday so I did go and I'm still
gonna take a laxative today though
because I felt like it was like it
wasn't like sufficient enough for me I
still feel a little bloated in the
stomach area so I'm definitely gonna
take a laxative today yeah so tomorrow
starts my 21-day challenge I really
can't work out that much because of my
surgery so when I go up Wednesday he'll
tell me that I got to wait like six
weeks after the surgery to actually work
out so what I'm gonna do I'm working out
meaning like I can't do upper body move
upper body workout like with weights and
stuff like that because of my muscle my
breasts so what I'm gonna do is probably
just do like a lot of the lower body
workout side lunges squats and stuff
like that and stuff that I'll target
like my lower stomach which is my
problem area so
hopefully hopefully that works out well
and I put a wig on today yeah should I

21-day challenge is about to be late
late it's good evening so I'm in my bed
now late night so I see a lot of stuff
today I went out to a pop I hop I went
to Costco's then went to Walmart so I
did a lot of stuff for my 21-day
challenge that I'm starting tomorrow so
I will link down the information for the
21-day challenge down below in the
description bar if you guys are
interested in knowing where I got it
from she has a YouTube channel her name
is Britney babe and she's also on
Instagram as well very popular and she
has a killer body so I went and bought
some stuff in preparation for the 21-day
challenge
and I also picked this up at Walmart and
I was telling you guys I was having
trouble using the bathroom so I got the
the wall my brain equate magnesium
citrate I don't know what I was telling
citracal whatever you guys it's a simple
accidents type of stuff so I got the
magnesium citrate and I just took a
little bit of it and honestly after I
took it I was even before I took it I
went to the bathroom just naturally but
it was really really hard so it was I
had a hard time so I took this one a
little bit before I went the first time
in the second time I just went it was
like a natural going it was excellent so
come back to normal guys I'm probably
gonna just take a little bit tonight
just so that I can because like I said
to you guys I'm the type of person
that's now I'm very I go to the bathroom
daily and allyce's TMI but I just want
to say just because if you take a
narcotics or anything like that it will
definitely slow down your GI system so
I'm just saying just to people that
don't know and aren't planning on
getting surgery or anything like that
that it definitely slows down your GI
and you don't want to be backed up like
that because if you do get backed up you
will definitely be in the hospital so I
just I'm like a really nervous person I
don't know if it's maybe just because
I'm a nurse but I definitely want to get
the magnesium citrate and it worked so
I'm just gonna take a little more
because the consistency of the justice
sounds so bad
the consistency is still firm so I need
to kind of soften it up a little bit so
yeah I'm sorry guys but I had to mention
that just just things that you need to
know now the video pulls up yesterday I
got a lot of positive feedback and a lot
of negative feedback I said that before
YouTube definitely blocked that video
they just I mean it's not blocked like
it's suitable it's not it's like some
like suitable for ads and not suitable
for ads but whatever I mean it's an
informative video it's a video that I
feel like people would like to see other
than other like you know boring video so
I kind of felt like that video was
helpful for someone who wants to get the
procedure done and for YouTube to block
that it just doesn't make sense to me
because this platform is a platform for
people to express their life experiences
whatever etcetera etc and I really
didn't feel like I was offending anybody
in that video and if I did offend you I
do apologize but for the people that the
video actually was helpful to you're
welcome and I'm sorry that YouTube feels
ice not that way whatever but I'm still
gonna keep posting so today this video
go up tomorrow which is Monday well
which is now because it's late so it'll
be like day three and four guys I'm
perfectly fine um I do feel like a
little bit tender and I know Wednesday
when I go and he's going to make me he's
gonna start me on my massages he's
probably gonna make me push the boobs in
together like bring them together drop
them up and pull them up so there's like
a whole there's a I already know it so
he's probably gonna be like to me you
know what to do I don't have to explain
it to I just need to check the scissors
and that's it so I'm gonna have to do
like these massage with my breasts and
that's about it I do feel like I'm gonna
catch stretch marks on my breasts this
time on that box I don't know why I feel
like it's gonna be happy more on the
side at the bottom just because I was
really stretched this time I was
stretched the first time I didn't get
any stretch marks but I feel like nah I
would stretch a lot because my boobs are
bigger now that I'll probably get
stretch marks but I know a way to like
I'll figure it out I'm not that's
something I really don't like I'm not
really worried about guys but it's
something to keep in mind like if your
legs really flat like to begin with and
you're trying to get large breasts
it will you would definitely get
stretched out and you'll probably get
some stretch marks but I'll worry about
that after the results right now they're
still kind of like hard like they're
rock solid hard boobs I can I don't know
so the implant is still pretty high it's
like up here so they have not dropped
completely yet and I do have to like I
said when I do the massage to squeeze
them together pull them down push them
up so you have to kind of loosen the sac
a little bit so it's gonna take like two
weeks two to three weeks almost a month
for them to actually be settled in they
are really hard like a rock right now so
it's not really that like interesting
but hey whatever I'm still rocking with
them and I know it's gonna take a while
that's the purple that's the reason why
I got the surgery in January so that by
the time the summer time comes up after
I do my leg little 21-day challenge and
stuff I'd I'll be ready body ready and
you know mentality ready and stuff like
that and my boobs would have already
dropped at that point so when April
comes around May comes around June comes
out may be able to wear like regular
stuff like I did tell you guys I'm going
to New Orleans next month and in the
month after I'm gonna tile in so I'm
going on trips and I know you guys asked
me so I'm going to vlog those trips
because you guys want to see so this
this year's going to be a lot different
I'm still going to continue to do my
hair views still do my fashion Friday
videos my haul videos all that kind of
stuff
transformation Tuesday videos but I am
going to add the dynamics of my life
into it just because I mean you guys I
mean I'm doing it now so you guys like
want to get to know me and stuff like
that so I'm gonna add that dynamics into
my channel you guys really liked
yesterday's vlog I got so many views the
one day I was shocked so you guys were
like really saying like I should
continue vlogging and not just vlog me
about breasts but like vlogging just
general stuff I'm not a pretty boring
person I do have like things I do during
the day and you know it's interesting to
like get to know somebody on the outside
of being like a beauty guru or something
like that and I don't even consider
myself that to be honest with you guys
