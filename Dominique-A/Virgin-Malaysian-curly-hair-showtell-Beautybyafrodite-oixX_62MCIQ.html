and I'm stopping by today to do initial
show-and-tell some hair that I received
from a company called beauty by after
day um the hair that I've got well I was
able to choose with some virgin birth
virgin malaysian curly hair I got a
closure and three piece here um the
culture 16 inches the bundles are 18 20
and 22 the hair came in priority mail
just regular US Postal Service her
company is based out of New York City so
I live in Connecticut and most of you
guys don't know that already so to be
basically a day she contacted me on my
youtube channel on the last Thursday and
then she agreed I would do the review
for her so she set the hero on this
Wednesday and I got the hair on Thursday
so it was pretty fast but like I said
she's her companies based in New York
and other than Connecticut so it's
pretty fast when I opened the package I
got this paper I was in the package and
she basically was thanking me for doing
she's basically thanking me for doing a
review and as you can see she puts all
the specs right here on the hair itself
and then you can contact her beauty by
Africa @ gmail.com she doesn't have a
website up and running right now if you
do want to see the air quality all the
hair itself the textures you can want
her Instagram I beauty by half a day and
she has a bunch of pictures and stuff
like that that shoulder had texture and
the type of hair and links that you
would desire um she also arm havoc
specials going on stuff like that so
check out the specials and she doesn't
post a price up there up there but if
you email her or leave a comment and Eve
the picture she will tell you the price
of the air so like I said 16 is culture
18 20 and 22 bundles okay so i'm going
to show you guys with the bundles look
like these are two of the bundles that i
got and this is 18 inches and 22 inches
and she puts the bundle number
the actual ribbon itself much did you
see that 22 so this is a 18 inch
obviously and this is a 22 and the curl
pattern is very nice and tight I did
co-wash to 20 years but no so i will
show you guys where the 20th bundle
looks like after the co wash is done to
it and it's really nice and didn't
really lose this time it didn't lose
this pearl pattern too much it just kind
of loosened it but it's like really
really nice and the hair soft I ran my
hand through all three bundles and I
didn't get any shedding which is good so
I'm thinking that I'm not going to steal
the web just because I want to see if it
doesn't share without stealing the web's
because then you can do a compare and
contrast so I rather just not seal the
webs and just put the hair on and see
how much Jenny I get versus if it does
shed I'll seal the webs and then we'll
know that it's you need to see the
westerly here so it's basically like i
said before compare and contrast so
we'll see um but this is the bundle size
and clearly when you have an 18-inch
bundle you get more hair and this is a
22 which I'm tapping right now and this
one has you know let's hear in the
bundle which is fine cuz I got three
bundles in a closure so it has no
particular smell but it has a beautiful
pattern and it has like this very like
like bouncy effect to it and i'll show
you guys with the 20 inch bundle looks
like it's really pretty as well so it
has like this really cool bouncy effect
it looks really natural and the texture
is kind of like a medium luster it's
really nice not dry these are with the
ends look light and ends I kind of
quickly and curly I think that curly
hair should be kind of like a little
slightly frizzy and slightly textured so
even if it freezes on me I'm not going
to do any like drastic measures to i'm
just going to use argon oil and water
just to hydrate the hearing that Sam I'm
not putting any other products in the
end because I want to give this product
for the first week to benefit as doubt
and then if it starts acting funny then
i'm going to try something else with it
but so far no shedding or tingling
whatsoever so i'm not getting any
strands of hair nothing nothing
absolutely nothing from this and like I
said no tangling or anything but get
that Libertango right there but you know
what the thing about is like with curly
hair you probably will get tangling just
because the tight
so the curl pattern so i will probably
get tangling but i'm not so much
tingling in the nape right here if I I
don't like hair like that so I hope that
that doesn't happen to this here but
that's the two bundles 18 and 22 inches
and this is the bundle that actually
co-wash Aiko watch this windows just so
i can show you guys exactly what it
looks like after I co washed it so i can
see the curl pattern remains the same
and it does remain the same i'll do a
compare against this one so this is the
18 inch and this is the 20 inch and the
curl pattern is basically the same and
as you can see this is a hair after I co
wash it and when I used to call watch
the euros a clear scalp &amp;amp; hair therapy
um and I just use like maybe like one
pump of shampoo on it and be done so
this is what the hair looks like after
and like I said it has this really nice
pattern very soft and like I said I
didn't get any shedding up well you know
when you watch to get like a little bit
of here because I just popped the rubber
band off of the bundle itself so I've
got like a little bit of hair coming off
and after I did that after in air dried
out I did not touch it once I finished
watching it I just let it sit there and
air dry so I didn't put my hands on you
run my hands through it or anything like
that so I let it air dry so after that
aired job this is the way it looks these
are the ends and the ends like I said
have it's like really fun of krill curly
pattern to it which is really nice so
for now the hair is a plus I actually
like it smells good obviously because i
use a shampoo but before i use a shampoo
the hair smells fine it doesn't smell
like I so this is what it looks
like and I like this guy this is really
really pretty and I'm excited so the
last thing I need to show you guys is a
closure itself and the closer came in a
bag and says Malaysian malaysian virgin
here and this is a 16 inch closure and
the color on this here if you guys can
tell it's like a natural color so it's
like a natural collagen is like a 1 B
but clearly it's not one because it's
virgin here when I did watch and get any
diet or anything so it's bra virgin here
so that's a good
don't lying does so this is the closure
guys and the closure is 16 inches comes
with baby here and i believe this is
swiss lace or front swiss lace around
the permit right here you can see the
she put a supportive border so that when
you do so down the closure it doesn't
shred or rip the lease doesn't tear
which is nice so it has it's well
constructed very nice and the curl
pattern matches exactly with the pearl
pattern of the hair its up which is a
plus the only reason why I got the
closure so long is because i don't like
gaps in here so if i would have got a 14
or 12 inch closer it would it look
stupid because I here is jumping from 12
to 14 only Johnson 18 and it for curly
hair that's not it doesn't look nice so
I just decided to keep it all um within
couple inches behind each other which
makes it just right like if i were to
jump from a 12-inch to 18-inch bundle or
12 inch closer to 80 inch bundle it
woulda been a puffy up here and then
there have been a long job here it just
looks stupid so i wanted to keep it
together express your curly hair now if
we're talking awesome like straight your
body wave here it doesn't matter because
you're going to put layers in it anyway
so that's different but this is a
closure and i'll show you guys the
parting space i do i think i'm going to
actually bleach the nuts on this one
that's not a soap base closure and it's
not bleach and the parting space is good
it's a little bit thick at the the
parking space is a bit thick but i am
going to be i'm pretty sure i can work
this out I'll tweeze and plop the
parting that I want and then i won't
bleach to bleach the closure just not
bleach it well which the knots just to
make it look more like soap AC but other
than that baby here is well constructed
it is a bit thicker on the thick side at
the root but that's an easy fix so this
is an aaa+ as well so other than that
guys that's all i have to say i miss my
initial video so i will post a video up
of the actual install and i will show
you guys how I put the lace closure on
because I'm doing an elastic band method
