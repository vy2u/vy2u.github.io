today because I know a lot of people ask
me questions in regards to my breast
implants so today when I'm going into
surgery for today it's an implant
exchange so basically I'm at 350 CCS
right now and I'm going to 750 CC now I
try to find other people on YouTube that
went to 750 CC originally I was going to
do 650 CC but the problem is that it
only goes for each CC that you do it's
only 15 milliliters each hundred I
believe it is so I wouldn't really make
that much difference especially for
someone of my frame now that I've gained
weight and I'm like I'm kind of like not
at the point right now where I'm trying
to be like skinny like it's just not my
thing so we discussed trying to find
implant size that's gonna fit my frame
and it's actually gonna look and match
my body cuz mines don't match my body
anymore when I got these done the first
time around I was like really skating I
was like at least 40 pounds less so they
fit my body at that point but now they
don't so I'm like I said I'm basically
going in for an implant exchange and a
different profile so I'm moderate plus
I'm gonna do high profile this time and
that's it so I'm not changing the
implant itself I'm keeping saline
implants and I'm using the same doctor
his name is Joshua Greenwald's and he's
located in Westchester New York so I
believe all of his information down
below if you guys are interested but I
wanted to vlog this in a good segment
where you guys can see like the
beginning of it and then the end but you
guys have already seen my boobs look
like but I'll insert a picture and so
you guys can see exactly what they look
like they look good but like I said they
don't match my body anymore and I just
want to change the profile and kind of
make them a little bit bigger and
rounder so that's what I'm doing today
so guys um I'm just waiting for my
boyfriend to come from upstairs and then
we're gonna get in the car and go
because my surgery is at ten o'clock
I have to be there 10 o'clock they'll
probably start at 11:30 and I'll be done
at 12:30 but I will let you guys know
how they one goes and I'll talk to you
guys after and let you guys know
everything that went down so I like to
keep you guys in the loop because you
guys will notice and I'm not the type
person to lie anyways because I've
already had it done so it's not like I'm
betraying you guys or whatever so I like
to
you guys in the loop and yeah I look
crusty today because I can't wear makeup
you can't have jewelry on and I even had
to wear my real hair so well short hair
so yeah so you guys will see everything
and I will show you guys my meds and all
that kind of stuff it's basically basic
antibiotics and some pain pills I
actually don't really like taking the
pain pill so I hope that this time is
not that bad after three days I usually
splash them down the toilet just because
they make me feel weird so I'm hoping
that it's one of those quick things and
I'm out of there so yeah so I hope that
you guys know how it goes I'm really
excited just to change them I know
something room by oh you should have
left them the way they were you were
perfect that way but it's not really
about what you think I should have did
it's about what Dom wanted to do so yeah
and I'm starving I can't eat like I
can't eat or nothing I'm starving so I
can't wait for this is over so I can
have like one of my protein smoothies
and maybe like some bags that'd be
really good hopefully I can I'm not
gonna seem like it's gonna be that much
opinion what's that pop a pill I'll be
able to get up though I think about the
pills are they make you really really
sleepy which is annoying so that's the
only annoying thing about it but I hope
everything goes well and I will see you
guys in the next three hours
alright guys so it's approximately two
hours after my surgery and I was just
really tired so I went to sleep no you
guys didn't see they're like really sure
so I'm gonna just tip this over sales to
see so basically I got an implant
exchange and he we actually ended up
doing 650cc he already automatically
said that once I went past five hundred
was going to look really big
so there are 650 CC implants and they're
saline under the muscle and then we
didn't do high high profile just because
I'm broad in the shoulder he kind of was
like to me let me do it
moderate-plus which I had before and he
kept the same profile and just increase
the size by 300 cc's so this is what it
looked like
now I'm not gonna be I'm gonna be honest
I'm not in as much pain as I was the
first time so I'm just a little tired I
only took one oxy and you can take one
or two each for every four hours I only
took one I really didn't do anything for
me so I'm kind of like over already
it's apart it's usually what pills that
she's about 30 minutes for it to
actually hit you the right way but I'm
up and walking so tomorrow I'm
technically supposed to post a video a
clothing haul up but I didn't even have
the time or the strength to do that
because I was running around last week
trying to figure out some stuff before
my procedure but I'm very happy now like
they are like the size I wanted so they
actually fit my body now and actually
Slim's me down a little bit because my
body's proportions I have bigger boobs
bigger butt and they're like my ways
obviously is a little bit smaller so
with my new diet and training and stuff
I thought I'll be able to get that body
I want or like kind of similar to I'm
not trying to lose weight like I said to
you guys in the beginning I'm just
trying to kind of train my waist and try
to train myself to live a better
lifestyle healthier lifestyle but I'm
really happy that I changed the boobs so
I'm happy that I got that over with but
um I can't wait for it to be over after
like three days I hope it's like dawn
because like I'm like I feel like I'm
useless right now I can't do shit so
yeah
and it looks like I have absolutely no
neck right now shut up so yeah so it is
752 Eastern time so I'll probably come
back to you guys before I go to sleep
and tell you guys how my pain levels at
right now if my pain level was like
three wait wait no I like four stop
making fun of me it's not funny like my
pain levels like three or four right now
and I have to sleep up which is annoying
because my neck hurts I just want to put
earrings on put a wig on I don't want to
do stuff like that and get cute but I
guess I'm not gonna be able to I go back
to work on Tuesday I don't know if I'm
lovely Oh to go back to work on Tuesday
well yeah Mitch oh gosh fashion
stupid boy
so yeah so I'll come back and let you
guys know how I'm doing so it's
approximately 1:30 in the morning
Eastern Time so I'm in bed now and I'm
feeling fine like today it only took one
pain pill for the whole entire day just
because I don't really feel that much
pain I did notice that my left boob is a
little bit more it looks more swollen
than the right side they are both 650 CC
implant filled he ordered the largest
size for me and he told me my guy says
you guys really 500 would have been like
I already noticed that 600 would have
been big in 650 would've been big so we
kind of try to do it between 6 &amp;amp; 7 so
I'm happy to 650 it looks really good
and if I would have went bigger to 750
which I originally thought and would
have just been too much like oh my god
and it would have been too much for my
chest it definitely is a large look
different it's like double the size I
had before and they look really good
guys like I show my friends and my
sister they're like wow so I'm
definitely gonna show you guys when I'm
ready to UM handegg undress and stuff
like that I don't sleep till late so
that's why I'm still up and my boyfriend
laughs he's such a good guy like he came
from New York he stayed here and with me
and then we drove there this morning
drove me there this morning waiting for
me and then stay the whole day made sure
I was okay and stuff like that so he's a
great guy my mom actually came and slept
in my room which is weird she came to
stay with me and slept in my room so
she's like sleeping now you guys my hair
is snoring but everything is good I'm
really happy that I got this done like
even like just straight off looking like
fresh right now you can its I'm more
proportioned like it looks really good
it's it's like perfect guys like it's
just it's perfect he did a really good
job like I said only the information
down below so this video is basically
the first day status post one day one so
I will come back and do they two and
then I'll post this video Saturday so
you guys kind of have like a day 1 and
day 2 breast augmentation revision video
so I'm gonna head off guys I got a
couple emails to answer and I want to do
that before I go to sleep
I am having a wig sale on Friday b12 so
you guys will see that and the thing
about my website is because I'm only
having like one unit it's kind of like a
unique units a limited thing so you get
you only be the only one with this one I
don't know it's just I like the concept
and I do have like a lot of units and I
am gonna start selling my custom unit so
it'll be really cool so I hope you guys
enjoy this and I want to say thanks for
all the support guys and I will do a
video detailed video about my boobs and
we'll talk and chit chat and I'll show
you guys what they look like before
versus look like now once they've
settled in I go back for another visit
on the 17th was just Wednesday and I'll
bring you guys along with me guys so you
guys could actually see what happens and
stuff like that so hopefully that works
out I'm not want to say that I'm gonna
do it it's like I'm not gonna do it so
yeah so I'm gonna just finish up a
couple things and then probably hit the
hay and wake up tomorrow and my friends
gonna come over and try to help me pack
it some of the weights for sale and
stuff like that so I'll see you guys
later
good morning everyone so it is day 2 of
my procedure now I honestly feel like
when you get something done a second
time it's not bad the only thing that I
feel is different is that I have like a
little bit of burning in the nipple area
so I give my incision underneath the
areola they on the open area up to put
the implant in I have saline implants
obviously so it's a bit easier for them
to do it that way but I woke I went to
sleep at like 3 o'clock in the morning I
was doing kind of like some stuff like
business stuff I did release my website
today so I do have like 20 units on
there now people are actually buying
them I actually have more units so this
is just not one of those flash sales
guys I'm actually gonna continue to do
the website now the what I'm gonna do is
post up like five new units every week
I'm also going to start selling my
custom units so expect those prices to
be a little bit more but everything that
I'm selling is less than two hundred
dollars nothing is even two hundred
dollars to be honest with you guys so
you can purchase two eggs off the
website for about 350 and they'll be
like long wigs nice weights only worn
once guys and I even customize it for
you and everything so you're getting
like a bundle deal a to long nice either
three six
see wigs lace front ones that barely at
least ones that like a few and I have a
lot of 360s so you getting into 360s
full lace wigs and altogether if you put
your money right you could buy two weeks
for 350 so I think that's a pretty good
deal I know a lot of people complain
about the wigs on the on my website I
mean on my channel not being affordable
at linked stuff like that but like I'm
telling you right now my website is
super affordable so if you were looking
for that particular unit I advise you to
go check it out now but like I said I
will post up like five more wigs within
the week
within each week just to give you guys
something else to purchase if you're not
interested in the ones that I have I do
have other ones that I'm not I'm not
gonna keep so I'm gonna sell them have
some colored ones some cool ones and I
might even custom color some for you
guys and then sell them to prices vary
depending on what I did if I did have to
go in and dive in here a shit out stuff
like that is gonna go up because that
thing takes processing in time so you
have to understand that but I'm seeing
that people are actually liking it and
are actually purchasing the what unit so
I'm really excited about that and thank
you guys for supporting me let me show
you guys quickly with the website looks
like because everyone will ask so
hopefully I can do it on my camera so
it's the website is from big car town
it's called shop Dom's room so these are
the units that I have on the website so
far guys if it says sold out somebody
has yes sold oh yeah so some of them are
being brought it is early I posted at 10
o'clock
this is East Coast time 10 o'clock and
then West Coast would be 7 a.m. I know
somebody from California already
purchased some units she woke up early
to buy her stuff so there's a lot and
you can go through the products guys you
can do curly units and then you could do
straight unit so you can you can
decipher or kind of like minimize it
down but everything's pretty solid I'm
sending you guys everything it's nice
stuff that you guys see me wear before
you guys can purchase yourself so hope
you guys aren't interested in this this
was always working on this whole entire
time
and since I'm staying home and I'm in
remission right now I just decided to I
just decided to put it out today my
friends will be over later to help me
pack it some of the stuff has sent some
orders out tomorrow just so I think I
said it's 3 to 7 day shipping so I'm
trying to send my stuff out tomorrow so
you guys get your units next week so
that's good so they will be coming over
to
later which I thought was really sweet
but this is mainly the website guys it's
a cute little overview I don't know I
just thought it was cute and the reason
why I called the website Dom's room is
because my whole everything that I do I
do it from my room regardless like my
all my videos are done in my room and I
know that sounds cliche cuz a lot of
people start in their room but this is
like my room was my motivation it's kind
of like where I started like I don't
know like my room has really pushed me
like to do a lot of things and every
single video record is in my room at
Ryan halls and everything and most of my
wigs are stored in my room in my closet
I should have called it Dom's closet cuz
you know that those coat hangers I hang
up all the wigs on coat hangers which is
funny so I should have called it Dom's
closet but Dom's room just signed it
better to me welcome to Dom's room so if
you follow my Instagram you follow me on
snap you probably already see me posted
stuff up so definitely check that out
guys definitely check that out I'm
really excited and yeah so it's 1043
eastern time right now so I'm up it's
10:43 eastern time I'm probably gonna go
downstairs and make something to eat and
have a protein smoothie and I do have to
take antibiotics
by onedah yogurt because I'm not trying
to catch a yeast so I need to get some
yogurt with lactobacillus
part like some of the you got if you
medical you know under tongue ma anybody
who ain't abadox it's best for you to
take eat yogurt and some of them that
have the bacteria in it if you look at
Greek yogurt and look in the back they
have like a lot of the lactobacillus
bacteria and those bacterias help you
fight yeast infections so while you
taking antibiotics you have a cup yogurt
a day or two yogurts a day you'll be you
have a less chance of catching yeast
infection so I'm definitely gonna have
to have my sister go to the grocery
store before she comes here to help me
out but I'm pretty good on the pain
pills I don't really need it and just
kind of feel it in my focus okay I just
kind of feel like I'm a little bit tired
I do have one video to post up it's
another hair of you like I said you guys
are gonna hear of you and I post this
vlog up on Saturday and next week you
guys will get yours
by Sunday I should be back too I should
be okay so Sunday I will record some
more videos and I'm gonna do a
transformation Tuesday on my cousin so
you guys would get that too so guys
thank you for stopping by
and thank you for stopping by I'll catch
you guys later alright
I'm back so it's really gloomy outside
so I'm staying in front of the mayor so
I can record this just because that's
why the lights gonna really come in for
a might even feel like turning my lights
on cuz that electricity bill was really
expensive this month cause all the
Halloween not having Christmas lights
and stuff like that but whatever
um so I'm fine now I'm a little out of
breath cuz I came running up the stairs
pain level right now is like a 1 I'm not
I'm not even on meds right now to be I'm
not on a percocet or anything like that
or what is it yeah percocets is it no
oxy so I'm not on oxy right now I'm
chillin like no pain it's just a little
time the areola I'm just gonna show you
guys what they look like and I mean you
guys can see they're buff as fuck so the
implant is right here mines aren't too
too low because we stuck the
moderate-plus so this is hot and the
thing about it I've already had breast
implants before so we really didn't do
much we did a capsulotomy to close the
capsule of the old implant and we just
put a new size and I went double the
size so this is what the implant looks
like guys and it's like really a large
difference and the scoop of it is like
like it's like really big guys and I'm
like that's a little nervous I show my
mom I was like what the hell so they are
bigger it's a and it's more so tender
I'm gonna show you guys without a boot a
nip slip so they're really tender guys
and right in the areola area and thank
God I still have sensation on my nipples
I didn't lose sensation the first time
but that's always a scary thing that you
might you lose sensation hopefully this
doesn't come down so yeah so this is
basically what it looks like I'm gonna
show you guys in unit so yeah hopefully
no nefesh on so that's basically what we
are working with and they are like
double the size of my last one so I'm
really happy with the size guys like I
said I'm really sensitive around the
nipple area so it's like kind of where
the incisions at which is underneath my
areola that's what I'm kind of feeling a
lot of tightness and stuff like that so
that's mainly it but I do feel like the
new boobs are real proportion with my
body obviously right now they're like hi
Oh
messing up the light so obviously right
now they're really high and mighty they
will drop and when they draw
they'll have that natural drop you can
see the crease and the boos are right
here so it looks really good
he's probably gonna kill me with the
massages um when I go back on Wednesday
so when I go back on Wednesday we'll do
like those massages and stuff and I'll
tell you guys to show you guys how I do
them and stuff like that but um I don't
know I just thought this was good just
to do a quick vlog because sometimes
people don't like to mention stuff like
this that they do and I've done it
before like three years ago so it's not
like I lie about shit so I wanted to
just come and give you guys like how I'm
feeling stuff guys my ear oh Michael I
my chest is really tight but it doesn't
hurt and I explained it but yeah so this
is this is Dom's new boobs for now like
I said there's 650 saline-filled I will
list the price and stuff like that like
I said guys I paid cash just because
paying cash is easier and I've been Tim
before so I got a little bit of a
discount so it's just easy paying cash
you don't want to finance something like
that so yeah I'm probably crusty and I
probably have crest on my face so I'm so
sorry guys but yeah so I'm gonna edit a
video post a video for today and then
I'll post this vlog up Saturday today
it's Friday so you guys will get the
vlog for Saturday the tryna ha post to
try on house next week so you guys will
get double the dose so I hope you guys
will enjoy that and I might for the try
and haul just the Friday one you guys
will see my boobs then because of some
of the clothes that I have are a little
bit revealing so I'll try to quickly try
them on with the new boobs but they're
still high they haven't fallen so you
guys just gonna see to Hard Rock so hope
that's okay so I'll come back and update
you guys how I'm doing it's like 1:30
now Eastern Time
1:30 p.m. Eastern Time I'm gonna have a
protein shake and then take a nap
because I'm tired I got some good sales
coming in my friends are coming over
later to help me pack it some of the
products that people bought and yeah so
thank you guys and I'm like out of focus
here we go so yeah thank you guys and
I'll come back alright guys so it is
1208 a.m. it's late
I just got settled into my bed by sissy
so I got I should have used this yes
today instead I just realized that I had
this one and laying around the house the
micro crusty dusty busty right now but
it is late and I have a couple things to
do I will post up this vlog tomorrow so
you guys will see the post-op one in day
one and day two of my breast
augmentation revision surgery today well
I actually packaged all my wigs for
myself and I'm gonna go my sister's
gonna take me tomorrow to the post
offices send everything out I am getting
a peel box so if I'll let you guys know
my peel box so if you doesn't want to
send me anything you guys I will link it
down in my videos from now on so you
guys have access to my peel box and you
guys can send me whatever you guys want
so yeah so I'm really excited this is
gonna go up tomorrow and I hope you guys
are receptive to this I did tell
everybody on Instagram and snap that I
got it done over again so like
everyone's not like in like limbo and
right now not knowing what happened to
me so that's good so I'm probably going
to go to sleep as far as Spain guys like
I said before pain level is kind of real
minimum like I honestly today only took
like two perks did Ireland take one hit
take one my chest started tightening up
like towards afternoon about four
o'clock so I did take a percocet our oxy
sorry you see Ferguson oxy because I was
starting to tighten up real hard in my
chest area but other than that I'm fine
now they just feel real heavy and still
sore on the nipple area but I'll be fine
that's far yeah so um I hope this is
gonna be the last time I'm looking
crusty and busty I did record a hair
video today for a transformation Tuesday
so I'm trying to do transformation
Tuesday again so I did a hair video with
one of my friends
she's like my cousin like family friends
so I did a whole entire leg makeup to
turn the hair review so I'll guys I'll
show you guys the entire video I did her
hair it looks so freakin cute guys I
think did the baby hairs and everything
so like I said I'm trying to show you
guys videos where it's not always me
wearing the wig so you guys know like if
you buy the wigs for me I'll customize
them prior to your purchase because
obviously I try them on in the video and
then you guys will receive it nice
installed this video of church
transformation Tuesday I showed you guys
exactly how
the hair looked on my friend my cousin
it just looks so nice guys and the
makeup came out so nice too so that's
gonna be part of my transformation
Tuesday video and I hope you guys like
that one cuz I kind of worked hard on it
and she was freaking excited like she
loved it guys so I hope you guys like it
as well so I'm in good spirits guys I'm
not in like any pain right now
like honestly this procedure was like a
cupcake procedure to me honestly or
maybe my pain threshold is just like
nothing and I honestly feel like if you
got a boob job done before I was really
flat the first time I got it so they had
to stretch me like a lot so the second
time around they just expanded me but
it's not like I wouldn't double the size
so it's not like it's just a different
experience I'm not experiencing the same
type of pain I feel fine so yeah so guys
I'm gonna wrap this up I'm probably
gonna hit the hay and this is home sleep
and have like one pillow this way one
pillow this way and I just recently got
the neck roll cuz I can't sleep like
flat I can't sleep on my stomach I can't
sleep on my side so I have to stay up
right just for the positioning of the
breast so it's just something that I
have to deal with and you know got to
keep my my babies like nice and firm I
showed my friend today what they look
like she was shocked she did not excuse
that I did not expect that Wow they're
way bigger than I thought so I don't
know I hope that they don't look crazy
like I'm hoping that they don't look
crazy like my family members are like
really shocked they're like yeah those
are huge and like even when my boyfriend
was like but my boyfriend with me to the
procedure so he's kind of like what the
I don't know it's guys I can't wait to
show you guys I'm gonna do the Tryon
halls next week I should be fine by then
I'm really okay now to try on stuff but
I'm gonna take it easy for the next
Saturday Sunday Monday I'm gonna take it
