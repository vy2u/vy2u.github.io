[Laughter]
because it was
situation
you can say well like that
oh my eyes I feel like I belong with my
to see no cameras here it's been a great
year
alright guys so we are back at the hotel
room and it was absolutely amazing we
actually end up fighting it over that
would take us back well we don't have an
issue with that we just wanted to make
sure they knew the location so everyone
find an uber that can get the location
correctly and bring us back home I kind
of almost roll my makeup like I don't
know I got really emotional just because
like certain things I never thought in
my life that I'd be able to do like in
it it's just kind of like things I set
goals about and I've been able to
accomplish them God has been so good to
me for the last two years I've been able
to do a lot of stuff and most of the
stuff has been done because of YouTube
because my regular life my nursing life
is tough at that so I just want to say
thank you to everyone who supported me I
don't know I'm just like overwhelmed
with joy it's just like it's just so
nice to see that things I never thought
in my life that be able to do that I'm
doing right now and like I said I'm not
the biggest I'm waiting I'm not the
biggest I'm not a big youtuber I'm a
very small youtuber so therefore just
the little bit of love and a little bit
of you know opportunities that I get to
do stuff is amazing and I just want to
say thank you to everyone who support my
channel and watch you know my videos and
stuff like that because if I wasn't you
know doing this stuff I want to be able
to travel I wouldn't be able to go about
my life in my business and I always keep
you guys in mind every single time I do
something just because it's because of
you guys that I'm exactly where I'm at
today and with the support that I get
from you guys it'll continue to grow and
become the person that I've always that
I've always known I you know I was gonna
be you know it's just like it's just so
crazy how you know bad situations can
happen to you and then something good
can happen and then that good situation
can kind of like do a domino effect and
kind of like turn into other stuff and I
don't know I'm really thankful for
everything that's happened to me in the
last two years this year has been
actually started off pretty well
and has continued to be very well and
successful so I want to say thank you to
everyone
yeah so tomorrow we have the Eiffel
Tower tour Eiffel Tower oh no we have an
Eiffel Tower lunch and I will vlog that
one as well I hope you guys like the
beat face and all I kind of stuff from
today's video I really I didn't work
hard I'm as I say I work hard because it
took me like 35 minutes to get my makeup
done but you guys can see it's still
intact I did cry a little bit so it kind
of smudged up but you guys can see is
still intact I am doing a new contact
lens review so I will show you guys his
contact lenses that I have to review
when I get back so you just have to wait
for that video but other than that the
dinner was superb
it was actually really good I had you
know one of the doctors that I actually
work with he actually recommended and
when I told him I was going away again
and he was like you should go to this
place and I was kind of skeptical
because you know he's Greek he'll know
nothing about French food but he was
like yes you should definitely go here
so I'm definitely give dr. Gira's the
thumbs up because the dinner cruise that
we did was excellent guys it was
delicious so yeah so I will come back to
you guys tomorrow when I say goodnight
so you guys want to end the vlog off
nicely just because I'm having a great
day I just love I don't know there's
something about Paris when I entered
here that I just I fell in love I have
like a feeling about this place so I'm
definitely really in love with this I
don't know so yeah so I'll catch you
guys in the morning guys good night
and that's like first
this is
The Rasmus
the biggest one the biggest one after a
second smaller and the 30 ones like I
think today
Oh
so
you guys to see the doctor
we're gonna have the lunch now and after
the less we're gonna do their boat
curtly so
what look another port boat to us so
it's really
it was good to Daniela
she had lamb and mashed potatoes it
looks like mashed potatoes like shut up
so we're gonna have like a little bit of
coffee now and then we're going to do
that just walk around the coz you can
walk around the Eiffel Tower since we're
already you know like in the Eiffel
Tower
it's supposed to rain and I don't have a
hat we're going to do like a water
please right now so you don't sit on cap
and you could like take videos I'll
probably do my best videos from that one
because we're on the tour bus and the
videos just weren't coming out that
great because he was like stopping
breaking all day cool you know he hit
something too and we were he did
something like really hard and we yell
initially thought that he felt hard but
he didn't brake hard I think we honestly
Bob that's cute she thought that he hit
something because we are more like
Thursday's our last full day here
okay okay was cool I like shopping done
with like one
the next like no shade on my yeah
romantic vacation so it's not because
you know come here you'll get and you
just will meet you'll love it here
there's a lot of high-end shopping and
like I was considering buy like a
high-end bride
I'm not really some of the respective
you guys watch my channel I don't like
designer bags or like that so I ended up
saying I'm not going to spend like
thousands of dollars I'm sorry Ben
because I'm not gonna wear it so I
didn't want to get Balenciaga but then
I'm like I could buy them in the US and
not have to pay all the taxes here cuz
the money here converted is a little bit
more so
600 up civilian CIA how much happened in
London the villain team-up Ellen
theokoles with 569 pounder I don't know
how much I have been more money it's
been like a $700 so I rather just get
the Balenciaga theatres in the United
States so that's actually something that
I would wear dresses me buying like a
Louie like or that damn what and the
thing but it's like I'm like I need to
buy this on a designer like you know
it's not really me like and I'm not
gonna be thinking about step and come
out here and try to buy things trying to
show off when it's just not something
that I do because that's like a waste of
money as well tear this up so we're
gonna continue the vlog I will cut you
guys a little bit later I hope you guys
enjoy this it's definitely very very fun
and yeah so I hope you guys enjoyed this
vlog and I'll see you guys in like 20
more minutes probably you know
so we're on the boat
the best part guys ready that is great
man
right there we had dinner right there
what lunch right there
you had that thing
what is this bags look at these girls
these are real let me show you the scalp
this is Rio a room using Haitian curls
right here
o'clock so we're gonna do some souvenir
shopping and then go meet her at her
house just about 15 minutes away from
where we live so I'll kind of take you
over today I don't want to talk too much
just because I'm trying to get a lot
done before we leave our flight tackling
leaves that I think like 10:25 tomorrow
morning so that means we have to leave
like I like six like six separators so
trying to do as much as I can I was so
tired I did not adjust at the time just
because we weren't here for that long
like Thailand we were there for longer
and it was a 12 hour difference so I
definitely had to prepare myself with
that but I think I'll be fine when it
comes back to sleep times when I get
back home and I'm almost like this close
to doing like a vlog from Memorial Day
weekend because I'm not going back home
so maybe you guys will see that as well
too so I hope you guys like the look
today it's kind of like um we're like
you know orangie eyes and then kind of
you see underneath my eyes I have like a
little bit of that cranberry color or
kind of like a light orange color and
the eyes do complements it a lot so I
definitely cut my hand is ashy yeah so I
hope you guys like the look and yeah so
I'm catching those a little bit later
probably just do like a lot of footage
or the rest of the video just because I
don't want to keep blah blah blah blah
bad bad bad alright guys so we will
catch you guys
this place you have crepe so you're
going to test out their praise we're
gonna split one because I'm nothing we
write this around other like savory and
then there's a happy hour except they
use two glasses of cider other drinks
with the choice of one tackle from
creepy on weekdays with sad I will do
that it's a two glasses of cider or
other trade plus your tresses on top
I'm Susana
we just want to figure out where to get
a truck because we're doing some
shopping
I told you that I was gonna come back
and talk but I lied so we're just doing
this now we got a couple simulators so
we're gonna actually go back after and
we're gonna leave like what time should
we these are the sofa size 4:30 when
they look for 30 to get back over
because it's this is 19 minutes for
media but our house is 15 minutes room
hotel to get here - I said 19 minutes
because of the traffic go so we're gonna
leave here like at 4:30 and then we're
going to go to my cousin Sophie's house
shot dinner she's making us some food
and yeah so we're just going to just
scrape stuff going they don't have
struck a deal they do this they didn't
know strawberry choice it not numbered
we we're gonna get like a banana and
Nutella crepe
they got ice cream with it - that'll be
good and then we're just gonna get like
some wine some Chardonnay or something
she's assembly
we might give an L ice cream on the
crepe that's it so I kind of make sense
and then some Chardonnay
and that's it it's you know luckily I
don't I don't know if you noticed this
but this menu is in English so if any
time I use in English
which is great so we don't have to like
struggle to read this one at all
so wishes look plant yellow forever so
I'll show you guys what it looks like
once we did it but yeah so that's what
we're doing for the rest of the day guys
I said I was gonna come back and talk
but I had to say something so that you
guys aren't like what the she ended
his vlog so quick
but therefore all the stuff in the
middle range
I don't even know what it tasted it's my
first time having this
we
I don't care about
get the manner
furgus
Clara got anything small fam time
bridging a little walk so we can figure
out where things are well see their
family time is always the most best at
what always the most Bank is the best
time it was a good camera how about you
didn't know her dinner was exceptional
by the way hopefully gateway to
something here I doubt it I really so
much hopefully allows me like a powder
to I'm when I left I was 185 so
hopefully I'm like 190 which was my
original goal sorry my fingers in it no
I'm out of breath
and I got it from Sephora I went to
Sephora and Paris I got the fancy beauty
I probably do make a tutorial I know I'm
extra super duper late with the makeup
tutorial for fancy beauty but I'm not a
makeup guru so I decided that it wasn't
necessary for me to do what everybody
else did it but this is uh what kind of
the green tea mask that I have on my
face mmm yeah so I'm gonna leave it on
for 15 minutes we're about to go to
sleep
I just took benadryl just because I
wanted to knock out I know that's like
like some people aren't like no I'm
gonna have to say that because I'm
medical savvy so I took benadryl because
I need to go to sleep so I'm not - I
said the bandage I kind of feel like a
little bit you know I feel like a little
facts I'm under the blankie right now so
I'm gonna go to sleep guys I wanted to
say it was amazing um I really love
Paris guys I'm not gonna lie London was
cool whatever but like I don't
something about Paris is just it's
freaking amazing and I highly recommend
that you visit both places I preferably
would say that if I were to come here
stay in London for about like two days
and come to Paris for about six days
Paris is using amazing experienced guys
everything has beautiful and not just
because that family that lives in Paris
but it's just in general the vibe is
excellent here when you approach this
place you just feel like this I don't
know something about it if you've ever
been here before you know exactly what
I'm talking about if you ever did like a
double a double vacation where you kind
of went to London first in Paris after
then you know exactly what I'm talking
about there's something about this place
that's really magical or like really I
feel I almost feel like I belong here
which is crazy it definitely has a New
York vibe to it but it's kind of like a
classy New York vibe clap almost you
know what it is it looks like Manhattan
here all through yes it's cleaner than
New York - that's another thing so it's
just amazing guys I highly recommend ya
richer culture if there's a lot of
high-end shops out here but I wasn't
buying and doing high-end because it's
just I'm just not that type of person
and I said before
I'm not someone that buys like you know
spends like thousands thousand dollars
on designer things Danielle is so she
she would like to come over four
thousand thousand by like six bags but
I'm just not and I'm not gonna try to
act like that something on that I don't
buy stuff like that so oh yeah so it was
great guys and I want to say this is the
end of the vlog I'll be back in the
States
tomorrow around 2:30 p.m. afternoon time
and I'll probably do a Memorial Day vlog
just because I want to so you guys will
see a vlog from Memorial Day as well but
I would do two separate vlogs like I
said before so you guys look at this
vlog around like Tuesday or Wednesday
the first of all go up Wednesday and on
the waffle up Saturday so you guys will
get the vlogs after each other so yeah I
want to say thank you to everyone who
watched these vlogs and who watched my
snapchat Instagram all that kind of
stuff
thank you so much from the bottom of my
heart and what do you have to say Dan
alright guys bye love you guys so much
and I will catch you guys when I get
