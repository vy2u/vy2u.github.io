now it's now it's now it's now we
it's a leaper
gloves and got a bill got out a bit of
clubs and got a bill I've got my money
trip clubs and got a bill got a bit up
up and down up and down up and down the
floor if it's gonna banana Pro my trips
gonna banana
a banana banana
[Laughter]
oh it up oh it up
let's now we better let Sally better
alright guys so this is the final look
of the wool African hair company wig now
this is one of their units where it's
kind of like a custom unit so biscuits
and ankled Bob unit and it's an ombre
style unit now I'm gonna say this and I
hope it doesn't bite me in the ass but
this is one of the best when I mean best
best ash blonde colored units that I've
seen thus far from a company now I don't
know who does their wig colors of that
like a custom stylist that does it but
whoever colored this unit colored it
perfect so if you're into that kind of
ash blonde type of color like I am I
always try to achieve this color when
I'm customizing my own personal units
and I'm not that great at doing it this
ash blonde is perfect guys like I
absolutely love this unit guys and I
know I always say stuff like this but
this wig today is definitely a wig
Wednesday unit like guys like come on
like look at that look at how beautiful
this angled bob now it's supposed to be
an angle Bob obviously you can see that
the hair stops the front of the hair
stops right here like look at how nice
and structured and like guys come on now
it did come with a pre part already like
they already created their own part but
for some reason I don't really like when
companies do that part because the part
is so big and they kind of take too much
hair off of that little section so I
basically kind of like just curved over
a little bit and fold it over that part
that they created and add some hairspray
and put my curling iron on top of it
just to create my own part just redo
that but it really wasn't feeling their
part
now I also did go in and tweeze it
obviously as you guys saw in the
beginning so I basically had tweezers
around the perimeter just because it was
a little bit too thick for me and I
wasn't able to see a lot of life so it
didn't look like it was blending with my
hair so well blending with my skin so I
kind of said to myself let me tweeze it
off so that it couldn't just kind of
melt in and it looks more realistic now
if you're not someone that tweeze Ozora
knows how to tweeze I don't either I
just kind of been doing this as and
winging it and I've been kind of
successful in the last few videos doing
it so I'm just trying to learn step by
step there's definitely a lot of girls
out here that do have videos on tweezing
so definite them out
really scary when it comes to that but I
didn't want to go too crazy so I did as
much as I can to kind of give it more of
a realistic vibe so I hope that it's
sufficient enough for you guys but I was
afraid that I was gonna mess it up so I
took it kind of easy this time but I do
like it guys and if you don't know how
to tweeze def attack somebody else on
YouTube that knows how to do it because
they be killing the game but other than
that guys I love this I just did a light
curl with this one didn't do anything
crazy I did use the big sexy hair
texturising spray to kind of give my
hair a little bit of a different luster
I do like the fact that it was straight
but it was a little too silky for me and
I'm moreso of a Yaqui texture type of
girl when it comes to straight here so
adding some texturising spray to a Defen
gives it a different look a different
you luster which I like this now I also
use the Aussie instant freeze hairspray
it's the number 4 Xtreme hold I use this
on all my curling styles on my wave
styles or anything like that and
especially you're trying to change the
part and try to put them little flyaways
down I highly recommend purchasing this
because it definitely works very well
now I did use a little bit of the got to
be glue and you guys asked me all the
time so I used a yellow got to be glue
it's crusty I don't know what to tell
you I'm pretty sure the black one is
crusty as well - you're just gonna
either use some water use some oil on it
or just deal with it and I just deal
what it is what it is and I always get
asked this question - so the the powder
that I use is the contour palette from
BH Cosmetics my just cracked up I
already lost the top cover too and
everything so it's basically the dark
color palette and I just kind of mixed
the Browns together some people always
ask me this question you can definitely
use any face powder any foundation
powder that you have to match your
parting space it doesn't necessarily
have to be this palette just find any
powder powder or any foundation powder
that you have personally and just use
that for the part because that's exactly
what Dom does so guys I will leave all
the information down below for you guys
