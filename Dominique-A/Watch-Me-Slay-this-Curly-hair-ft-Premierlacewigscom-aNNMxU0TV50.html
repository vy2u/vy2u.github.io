today with another hair view so this
baby that was sporting today guys is
from premier lace wigs calm so this is
another 360 unit that they have on their
website now this is the Virgin Brazilian
curly hair it is pre plucked in the
hairline and it is 150 percent density
22 inches long guys
now just initially I know you guys watch
the beginning of this video I'm gonna
say hands down they've have the best
units ever this website does not
disappoint at all I will insert all the
videos in here so you guys can see all
the reviews that I did for this company
every single wig Slade now they pre
pluck the hair lines on these units so
therefore when you get the unit you
really just gotta customize it yourself
so what I did in this videos will show
you guys the steps that I take when I
first get my units so I cut the lights
off this bad boy I showed you guys what
it looks like when you just kind of have
in your looking like clearly a mess in
the beginning and then I went in and
showed you guys how I tweeze the front
I also added powder cut the baby hairs
until the baby hairs down now guys let
me let me just you can't even tell me
right now that this one is not slain
like every single unit from this website
has been legit guys like look Wow
like like come on like come on like this
company does not disappoint at all guys
and when you see me gushing about a
company like this you know that I really
really like the unit now this is their
Curley unit so therefore I didn't Co
wash his hair I basically just went in
and wet the front of it so I can kind of
give it slick it down so I can put it in
a ponytail so basically this is a
natural curl that it comes in at they're
very nice curl pattern and I kind of
wonder if I wet if you'll still be the
same but when I did what the front part
in the front it dried up and ended up
being the same pattern so I was like you
know what it's gonna be good now one
thing I do wish is I wish that this was
like a hundred eighty percent dusted or
two hundred I feel like it does have a
little bit of more spacing in the back
just because it's 150 it is curly hair
so if you want it to be kind of big you
can go in with the comb and kind of
tweeze in the back but I just feel like
that's an unnecessary movement right
there so what I would say to you if you
ordered this wig order like 180 or 200
percent density cuz then it would be
just all types of popping but for the
hairstyle purposes right here guys you
cannot like can we just can we just like
see this right like and like my tweezing
skills aren't up to par like I'm not
like that good with tweezing my hairline
so when I show you guys me tweezing
hairline I'm really nervous doing it cuz
I feel like I'm gonna mess up and stuff
like that so I kind of meticulously went
through and try to work it out as the
best I could so I hope you guys like
that I show you guys that part of the
video because I don't want you guys to
think that I just put the winner get the
wig put it on my head and just go about
my business cuz you gotta have to
maneuver the wig to make it look how you
want it to look so I try to show you
guys that portion of the video so that
you guys know that I'm not taking this
without the pack and plopping it on my
head
so after tweezing it and just I don't
even style I just put it up in little
ponytail I kind of feel like I really
really like this a lot guys like I'm
very very satisfied with this entire
look I think it looks great
and I cannot wait to rock this
throughout the season this is definitely
one nice curl pattern that you'd wear a
spring summer winter whatever all
seasons is just well-rounded and I
definitely like the fact that the
hairline was pre plus or it was pre
plucked previously so therefore I didn't
have to go like overly like crazy with
tweezing it was kind of already fixed
for me so therefore I just
to win and likely and kind of fixed it
the way I liked it to I liked it to be
alright guys so that's basically it for
