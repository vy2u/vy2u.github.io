another wig review so this baby that you
guys see me sporting today is from OMG
Queen here calm now this hair is
completely different for what I usually
do so this is a pink I'm Brady Styles
unit and this is kind of like more of a
Valentine's Day inspired type of look
now I wanted to do this video just
because I know Valentine's Day is coming
up so if you're like last and they try
to rush to get a hairstyle think about
this in consideration there are a lot of
girls out there that do love like a nice
college unit and they custom color this
for me so it's easy just to get off the
website and you're done
now with this one guys I'm not really
someone who does colors like this this
is kind of bright for me and kind of out
there but I'm trying to do more
different things for that my channel
this year so this is definitely
something to step out and do now I do
like the whole concept of the pink ombre
I was thrown off initially because the
color of the pink is almost like a
salmon color in real life like to you
guys right now it looks different but
like in person it's a little bit more
salmon like salmon salmon salmon salmon
whatever so it's a little bit more
salmon like so I'm kind of I was a
little bit thrown off in the beginning
and another thing I noticed was that the
rooting part was a little bit dark now
usually like my roots to be like medium
brown or kind of like a dark brown just
because it looks a little bit more
natural this one to me is almost like a
black so kind of completely threw me off
when I initially saw it but then after I
kind of looked at it I glued it down I
was like okay it's not that bad I show
my sister's in there like okay it's not
bad the colors a little bit funny but
and all that like the whole book the
design the kind of feeling vibes it's
kind of cool so I was like you know what
it's a go so I definitely like you guys
I did just go and tweeze a little bit of
the perimeter I had to add powder
completely on the perimeter just because
the lace is a little bit too late so
when you're picking this up just make
sure you get a lace that's kind of like
closer to your color
IMed even sure what lace coverage sent
me but I will definitely go down below
for you guys so definitely add your
powder on just to make it look more
realistic one side of the powder and I
was completely like yes this is it now I
did have to cut the baby hairs because
the baby hairs were perfect I just kind
of added some got to be glowing to sweep
them along and I was done with that so I
definitely like this here
it's definitely something different like
if you like color then definitely check
them out they do have some colored units
on their website and this one is
definitely something different for me
and different for my channel so if you
like color like this and you want kind
of like a nice cute little style
hopefully you'll have enough time to get
this before Valentine's Day you want to
be jazzy you want to show your man
something different than deathly hop on
the bandwagon but yeah so I will link
all the information down below if you're
interested in purchasing this unit this
is a lace front unit so you only get
about three inches of parting space in
the front it does have it did come with
an adjustable strap and it also came
with a strap that they actually pre put
on the wig so that was cool too so you
kind of have like an adjustable strap
and then like the strap in the back so
that was excellent so it is big head
friendly this one axe was a little bit
big for my head so I had to kind of
frame it a little bit by cutting like
the side tabs a little bit just to make
it fit but other than that I had no
issues I think it looks good their wigs
are pretty good in general anyway so
therefore it had that much of an issue
with this one it just was like put it on
styled it and let's go so I did use my
curl one you guys saw that in the video
and it was pretty simple I think I do
have a video on my channel high curl on
my hair I used to do voli curls one I
think it's like one and a half
millimeters I'm not even sure I don't
know so I'm not gonna make that up but I
use my curling wand and I think the
curling wand looks better it just kind
of gives it more like a nice soft Barbie
pink kind of look and I just I'm I'm
vibing what they're I know like I'm
really really vibing with it so I like
it so guys I will leave all the
information down below if you're
