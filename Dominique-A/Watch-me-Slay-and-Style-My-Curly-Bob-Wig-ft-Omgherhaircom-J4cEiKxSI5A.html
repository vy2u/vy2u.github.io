of the hair so basically I deal with
this guys just play with the hairline
just a little bit I did add some a
little bit of baby hair magic on the
sides I did also go in and use some
product on just the front part of this
unit so I did spray it down with water
and then I added the Eco style gel the
green bottle and I just kind of scrunch
it into the curls in the front so that
it could be more pour like I wanted to
kind of do a comparison of when it's dry
and when it's curly so I can kind of
show you guys that the curls still
remains very similar once it's wet I
know sometimes you get the wig in the
package it looks awesome so you're like
I'm not gonna put any water on I'm not
gonna touch them I gonna do anything
because I want to preserve this look but
eventually gonna have to toss the curls
around Oh get a little frizzy so then
you have to add water on it so I wanted
to show you guys what it look like
straight at the pack versus when you
actually style with water and a little
bit of product so like I did this time I
use Eco style just because Eco style juh
was gonna really give me the curl that I
like and it was also gonna kind of
stiffen the hair a little bit just a
little bit it also gave you a nice lift
and a nice really kind of like like a
dressed-up style or kind of style or
kind of like a really nice natural style
so that's the thing that's the whole
entire thing to me was just what I was
looking for and adding that equal style
John and definitely gave me the feel I
wanted so this sounds really good to
guys I could go back in and tweeze a
little bit more but I just decided to
leave it the way it was because I
thought hey I did a good job alright
guys so I'll leave all the information
down below if you're interested in
