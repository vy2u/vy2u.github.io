alright guys so you guys are always
asking me to show you guys how I asked
by my units so I decided today when I
review this week to show you guys how I
get the color to turn to an ash color so
this book is from oMG clean here and
they sent me a 613 full blonde lace
front unit so it basically has your
standard three two combs on the top one
come in the back and adjustable strap
and it's about the re inches apart in
space so this way we'll probably get
parted curved part or side part now it
is a completely six thirteen wig and we
all know that Dom's not going to wear a
wig like that so I went to Sally's and
purchased the weather charms toners so
the first one that I got is a t 18 which
is the lightest ash blonde and at the T
15 the pale base bond and the T 27
medium phase blonde so I'm gonna use my
forty vine developer and I'm going to
mix it with three of these top toners
and I'm going to saturate the unit with
this color and kind of make it kind of
almost like a blended blonde and a
blended blonde that's gonna look good on
my skin tell them this is the first time
I'm mixing colors like this so it's
going to be kind of like a trial and
error I'm kind of crossing my fingers
that this actually works so I hope that
it does so I'm going to mix everything
together and show you guys the mix looks
like and then I'm going to saturate the
hair and you guys will see the final
results
the foam ball
and that
let's owie owie owie owie
clubs and gotta build out a bit of clubs
and out of bills I've got my money trip
clubs and gotta bail out a bit of Club
and dab it on a banana Pro up and down a
pro rippers gonna banana Pro my trips on
a banana
banana banana
[Laughter]
oh it up oh it up
that's our power
sorry pal
sorry
today with another wig Wednesday video
and obviously you guys can see straight
up what this way is looking like if you
watch the beginning in the video I
showed you guys all the specs and stuff
that I did with the unit so the only
thing that it did was tone this unit and
I use well it charms toners so I linked
on everything down below for you guys so
guys are interested in customizing your
own unit now I'm not really like a crazy
crazy blonde person like that but I
wanted to try something new for my
channel so I hope that you guys like
this I'm still trying to adjust to it
because it's kind of like so bright that
I'm like I don't know if I can walk down
these Connecticut streets like this guys
like honestly it's kind of like a shock
in the beginning I didn't expect it to
be so difficult to kind of manage like
it's kind of hard to kind of style this
because the color kind of shows a lot of
the imperfections so when you're kind of
doing baby hairs wet hair blonde hair
you kind of conceal out of the crusty
areas and then when your makeup is
mixing with the blond hair it kind of
can look dirty and kind of uneven so if
you know what I'm talking about leave a
comment down below so I just kind of did
it I didn't have the opportunity to kind
of really play with the baby hairs
putting got to be glue on it would have
kind of really made it messy so I all I
did was kind of like use a little bit of
water and kind of like curl them like
kind of curl them up to make them look
fine and pretty so um just keep that in
mind when you're trying to wear blond
hair you're trying to style up the baby
hairs and all that cuz it doesn't really
work out as well as you think it's gonna
work out now I didn't Darkroot the part
at all all I did was add powder to the
part just to kind of make it look a
little bit semi-realistic when I do like
this it did come in the color 613 and
the 613 was like that nasty yellow color
so I was like you know what I don't want
to I don't want that so let me just try
colors so I tried to tone it to give it
more kind of like an ash tone color so
basically turn the hair from like a 613
yellow blonde it's a kind of like a
snow-white blonde so it's really really
uh kind of like a snow white grayish
color but I like it guys I don't think
it's that bad it's not something I
personally will be walking out the house
everyday with because this is the type
of hairstyle you got to be looking like
beet face q all the time like with my
regular black units I can go out with
glasses and call it a day and just be
real Plain Jane but this one you have to
be like really classy really beat all
the time
so this not gonna be that type of wake
for you girl so I'm I did show you guys
it was straight in curl wands and all
that kind of stuff so all I did was kind
of strain it back out and then I went in
and put some soft curls in it with my
bigger barrel so Debbie can take it can
app well let me say it definitely can
handle multiple styles which is perfect
it's not dry didn't kind of like get all
crazy-looking so this unit was
originally 18 inches long so all I did
was go in and cut it to kind of make it
kind of like a choppy look but I
completely screw the top you look this
time so I'm gonna have my girl come down
and do kind of like a lob for me so kind
of shoot it on the back of really long
in the front to give me more of like a
edgy look with this because I do like
into the middle part sound when it's
straight and I do even want to do kind
of like a flip over method with this
want to do a side part I think that
would be really cute and sexy so we'll
see what I'm gonna do but I'm not gonna
touch the roots out or leave the roots
the way they are just because it looks a
little bit more realistic when the roots
are like this if you guys watch in the
beginning I did have to cut the side
right here so the ear tabs were too long
for me if you ever encounter that issue
I recommend just cutting it to fit
around your ear it's not gonna damage
the wig or anything like that so I
basically just cut around the ear tab so
they can adjust and fit around my ear so
that when I glued it done it was
perfectly placed on the side so if you
have ear issues with your ear tabs not
adjusting or fitting around your ear you
definitely go in and cut them to kind of
carve the shape of your ears which I
usually do and this time when I did
actually fit perfectly so I'm happy
about that so I know you guys like shut
up girl just tell us about the giveaway
so the way that I'm giving away this
time is a red wig that I showed last
week and it was kind of like the full
red wig that everybody was loving so
