another wig review now this food review
is watching you guys by béla wings calm
and this week that I have is a Brazilian
virgin here in 14-inches this is a
natural color and the size of the cap is
average size this hair is 120 % density
and the lace colors light brown the lace
area is actually pretty big it's a three
by five and it's enough to do a lot of
free parting the wig has its natural
baby news around the perimeter and it
actually looks pretty good um the one
thing I did notice about this wig is the
baby hairs are really really long so I
do have to do some cutting with these
hairs the cap does have three combs as
at the top and then adjustable straps in
the back which is good it does have a
lot of body weight which I really like
about this hair as well so basically in
this video I'm going to show you guys
how I actually styled this plate for the
first time I don't usually do these in
my videos but I decided to add this in
the video this time because I want to
give you guys some variation in some
kind of more complex video to show you
guys how I get my way to looks label so
basically this part I'm just kind of
getting the part right I used to spray
with any type of spray that's a heat
protectant spray that I'm using and
let's see down below exactly which
branding is actually for that which is
basically spray it down and use I make
the part and I use my curling iron to
kind of get the parts stay permanent
which works fabulously and then what I'm
going to do is cut this into like a long
bob Allah but whatever you want to call
it it is going to be kind of like a all
the way kind of same length look but I
will keep some length in the front to
kind of make it look like a lob or bob
or whatever you want to call it so I was
really wanting to do it here so like
this because it's a good transition from
summer to fall and it will look really
good I'm not going to call this wig I'm
just going to keep the wig the way it is
because I want to just keep some
variations with the hair but as you'll
see I actually did a good cut and I
think actually came up pretty good
so here is the final result of the hair
guys I hope that you guys really really
like this unit as much as I do you
cannot tell me right now that this wig
is not freaky as the parting space
on here is so nice and long and it looks
so realistic I just added my regular
face powder on it that matches my
foundation to give it this liveliness
the hair is so nice the curls are
effortless I just add a little hairspray
on it and just put some really soft
curls in it to make it look really
effortless and Q I consider this a lob
it's kind of like longer in the front
and a little bit shorter in the back I
think this style is fabulous for the
fall season I hope you guys like this
hair because I really like it as well
and I'm just so excited right now
alright guys so this is a finishing look
of the wig that I've created
well not that are catering I said so I
basically customized a way to show you
guys different ways now in my videos how
you can customize ways you guys receive
wigs
you guys already seen me coloring wings
to customize them and stuff like that so
I just want to do a cut just to show you
guys with this big looks like so this
was originally a 14 inch so now it's
about like a 10 or 12 inch I just kind
of blunt cut it through and added some
beautiful soft curls to it and put some
hairspray on it just to keep the curls
as I can see it very nice as an
effortless middle part Bob or medium
length hair I think it looks really nice
and natural this is a great style from
transitioning from summer to fall so I
just want to kind of do something
different on my channel for you guys so
you guys can pick out options of
hairstyles to do and blah blah blah and
blah blah blah but um I really like this
unit
it does have little baby hairs around
the perimeter which I'm not really into
but I just tucked them underneath the
cap my head is a little bit smaller so I
did have to put elastic band from ear to
ear just to kind of give me a little bit
tightness and comfort with the wig but
if you have a larger size head this is
going to work very well for you this is
a meet a regular cap size so you figure
that one out I will list out everything
down below for you guys if you guys are
interested in purchasing this way I'm
telling you that's honest true this is a
nice wig very good wig very easy to
manipulate to get it to look what you
look what you want it to look like so
that's an a-plus-plus I have not
received any shedding so far so I'm
really really happy with it
