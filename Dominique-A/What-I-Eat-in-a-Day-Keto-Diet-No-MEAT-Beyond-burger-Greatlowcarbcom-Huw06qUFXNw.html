is gonna be a little bit different so
today's video is going to be a what I
eat in a day style video I'm sorry I can
kind of a she beat up dried up whatever
but who cares the light looks great so
basically I'm gonna show you guys what I
eat on keto I'm pescetarian I don't eat
meat so I kind of have to kind of wiggle
around and try to find methods to make
meals make recipes and stuff like that
but for the last few months I've been
pretty successful making kind of like
delicious meals and stuff like that so
if you guys want like recipe videos and
stuff like that just leave your comments
down below sorry if you guys can hear
the central air in the back the fan is
on and the back is just making a lot of
noise but it is super hot out here so I
need to be nice and cool so guys so when
I'm gonna have right now it's about like
1:30 and I start eating at one o'clock
when I'm fasting so right now I'm gonna
have like a brunch kind of lunch thing I
guess so I'm gonna have three scrambled
eggs and I'm also gonna have the light
life smart bacon so I'm going to
actually cook this you can put in the
microwave but I'm gonna actually put
this on the on a pan and kind of fry I
do use olive oil it's recommended on the
keto diet to use coconut oil olive oil
and stuff like that to actually cook
your food in so that's what I'm gonna
use to make this it doesn't give it a
weird taste I know some people are like
olive oil makes their eggs taste funny
but it doesn't make my eggs taste funny
I'm also gonna use Himalayan salt it's
recommended to use Himalayan salt it's
just a different it's like a bigger
crystal almost kind of like you know
crack salt like that type that you kind
of crack and you know you know what I
mean so I'm gonna use Himalayan salt as
well to to season and a little bit of
pepper this is really good the
nutritional facts on here say that the
total carbs for one slice of this fake
bacon is less than one gram it has zero
grams of fiber and zero grams of sugar
and two grams of protein so it's
basically a protein based meal right
here for the eggs and the bacon as far
as the big I'm probably gonna have two
pieces and just crumble them on top of
the eggs and I might even put some
avocado on the side and I do want to
show you guys this protein shake that
I've been drinking that is good I get it
from Costco's and if you're someone
that's either pescetarian vegan or
vegetarian and doesn't have that extra
source of protein these are kind of like
protein shakes are very good low in
sugar low in so
my baking gets a little bit crispy I'm
gonna show you guys the protein shake
that I drank so I drink the premier
protein shakes in the vanilla flavor now
these you can get at Costco store about
25 dollars a case and 18 come in the
case when I go to Costco is I usually
get two cases of the vanilla the
chocolate tastes funny to me actually
have some chocolate left here but I
actually don't like it so I give it to
my cousin or to guess and just like
chocolate and want a protein shake so
this one's pretty good guys it's about
160 calories three grams of fact it has
4 grams of carbs 1 gram of fiber so that
means that's 3 net carbs and it has 1
gram of sugar and 30 grams of protein so
this honestly is like a meal replacement
honestly I can actually have this and be
fine like if I'm eating for breakfast I
can have one of these in water and be
fine
it actually feels yep pretty good so
what I'm gonna do is have a little bit
of this in a small cup because I'm
having a lot of protein anyway so I just
want to have a little bit of this that's
flavor and then later in the day if I
want kind of like a sweet taste like for
dessert I'll have the rest of this and
this will be kind of like my milkshake
for the day so this is what I actually
use and this is pretty good you can get
this at Costco's I believe Walmart stop
and shop CVS sells it but they sound
like a four pack for ten dollars which
is kind of a huge ripoff no this is a
pink Himalayan salt that I use I get it
from CVS it's pretty Spacey cuz you get
this anywhere and like I said I saw
someone say something about pink
Himalayan salt being healthy or whatever
I also saw a fun fact on here I was just
googling something they were like okay
so I told you guys you eat 20 net carbs
now 29 carbs you eat it like that when
you want to put your body into ketosis
in the beginning now on here I'm reading
stuff that stays 2250 greens and net
carbs per day which is kind of correct
but if you want to lose weight and stuff
like that do the fasting and then try to
keep the carbs like at 20 because you'll
have a better chance of losing the
weight faster and actually keeping your
body in ketosis which is important so if
you're just starting this one does say
that it suggested that you start 20 to
30 grams now I told you guys this before
you're not eating right you're not
eating pasta you're not eating bread
because one serving just cancels out the
entire net carbs even a cup of cooked
rice like that you get from a bag is
like 48 or 42 grams of carbs so once you
eat that you're pretty much screwed so
those are not
that I used in my diet so I'll show you
guys what I do use as substitutes for
bread and pass and stuff like that so my
eggs and my bacon bits are actually done
so this is what three eggs of sight with
a little bacon bits on top of it hope
that you guys can see that so it looks
pretty boring right now so I am gonna go
and add a little bit of low carb items
on it to make it like a complete meal so
it looks like predicting today I'm not
gonna eat that much just because it's
already 2 o'clock
almost two o'clock so I usually stay
full very long so once it hits like the
late hours of the evening you will not
catch down eating a thing just because
that's when your metabolism has the
opportunity to not slow down and you are
going to gain some weight so I'm going
to use some jalapenos I like how
opinions I need to get some new one so
I'm gonna use this fresh pack of
jalapenos fresh pack whatever so the
nutritional facts on this one it has
total grams of carbohydrates one gram
and one gram of sugar
now that's one ounce which is about 17
slices but I'm only using like 1 2 3 4 5
6 6 slices so it's not really a gram of
carb at that point so I'm just gonna put
6 slices of jalapeno on top of this now
I'm kind of do kind of like a little bit
like a Mexican style kind of like
omelette now what I'm going to actually
do is use some of this fresh organic
salsa now I give this from Costco all
the time it's super super fresh guys
super super good now this has on the
back it says it's five calories for two
tablespoons and it's also one gram of
carbs 0 fiber zero sugar so it's only
one gram of carb for two tablespoons I
only use a little bit because I don't
need it to you know this type of stuff
is really wet and stuff like that way so
I don't think use like a little bit of
this like maybe like this much of it and
I just sprinkle it on top of my eggs to
give it kind of like an you know fresh I
mean even though it's fresh eggs just to
give like a fresh taste fresh look yeah
so this is pretty good guys keep this
about cos oh it's not like six dollars
and if you have like a large family I
don't so it you know you gotta eat it
pretty fast I don't know this time I've
kind of taken my time eating it maybe I
should just buy Ogas mom's
we have to have like a little bit of
avocado avocados do have carbs guys I'll
add the calculations into here to tell
you guys exactly what the breakdown of
breakfast was but breakfast is pretty
low carb guys and like I said this type
of meal will hold you down for hours
since I started eating at one after my
next meal probably like five six o'clock
or seven just hitting the seven before
it's time for me to cut all ties with
food but my dinner is gonna be very
simple guys you guys will see what I eat
for dinner I'll try to make it fun and
flavorful I did prepare the salmon
yesterday so I had it was like a big
piece of salmon so I had like a big
chunk left two chunks left so I'm going
to kind of style it up and make
something delicious last night's dinner
was delicious so I'm gonna try to
recreate what I made last night for you
guys it was very good it was filling and
it was just everything that I needed at
that point last night and I was
recording so I took like a quick break
and then my quick break turned into
making some delicious food so yeah so
guys so this is my food is I just added
the avocado on top so it's almost kind
of like a mixed thing it'll be good if I
like sour cream or something like that
but I don't so that's just whatever
so it has jalapenos fresh pico de gallo
it has like the bacon on it the soy
bacon scrambled eggs and avocado so it's
going to be really good I'm actually
gonna take my 50 tablet this is not
sponsored I actually did a video on this
way back but I still have the tablet so
I'm gonna take my 50 tablet as well with
half of the protein shake and a large
glass of ice water and that'll be that
it is one let's see what time is it it
is 150 right now so I'm gonna eat this
run some errands come back home like I
said my Salmons already prepared so I'll
make like a delicious dinner tonight and
show you guys what I eat and yeah so
stay tuned guys so guys let's try to see
what it tastes like
so I try to cook this as fast as
possible so that it doesn't get cold but
looks like it's good
it tastes like an omelet but not
everything mix together but it's really
good taste fresh mm-hmm well you know
okay my mukbang
good mom that's really good trying to
add a little bit of sugar-free catch up
to it just a tablespoon worth of
sugar-free ketchup might as well go
though and it's almost kind of like a
make a Mexican omelette all the
ingredients are really fresh nice song
this is a thumbs up so I put the protein
shake in this cup right now and this is
pretty good too like I said you take the
50 tablet right now just because um I'm
eating now all right take one
so it's pretty good guys and like I said
on the drink half of this because they
have so much protein in it but my meals
already protein fortified so I don't
have to go crazy but it tastes like a
milkshake honestly like when you stop
eating sweets and stuff like that you
find different substitutes your buddy
just kind of adapts to it and this
actually tastes really good I was
drinking this even before I started keto
and I used to like it a lot
cuz probably I was getting really fat
because I was just eating a lot a lot a
lot a lot but this is really good as
well to guys so definitely check out
costumes on there premier protein shakes
all right hi can I have a medium hot
coffee can I have the sugar free french
vanilla the unsweetened french vanilla
shot in it yeah but the unsweetened okay
can I have almond milk and then can have
two equals on the side that's it thank
you so I got myself a coffee can I go
out this way I think about this way so
guys I got myself a medium hot coffee
now I get mines with almond milk guys
and I also get it with of unsweetened
french vanilla shot in it I like the
Frenchman L shot it's just out of focus
well let's turn around so I get it with
the unsweetened french vanilla shot it
looks so good and then I get two equals
on the side I haven't had regular sugar
like use regular sugar and like like
almost an entire year so I'm just using
this the substitutes even though people
say like the sugar substitutes aren't
good for you whatever I don't really
care I'm not a dietician like I always
say so now I'm gonna go I'm asked to do
some errands anyways I want to show you
guys I do get coffee and stuff like that
like it's kind of hard to get coffee at
McDonald's oh because they use regular
milk they don't use a common milk and
you can drink almond milk on keto
because it's really low in carbs so yeah
so I usually use the almond milk when I
make my macaroni and cheese but I will
show you guys some recipes if you guys
want you have to let me know down below
because certain things that I need to
make the recipes that I have to order
online so I do have a great company that
I use when it comes to getting like
products like breads pastas and stuff
and the stuff is like really really low
carb guys so I want to make sure you
guys want those types of videos so I'm
just saying her comments down below but
I'm gonna run my errands and I'll
probably come back to guys around like 5
o'clock with my dinner there's gonna be
fun it's gonna be something that you'd
think you wouldn't be able to eat but
you still can eat which is great alright
guys so it's a little bit later in the
evening when I'm recording my last meal
so tech would be today I've only eaten
twice including now so what I'm going to
make now is a burger and I'm gonna make
the Beyond burger so I got this at Whole
Foods it's pretty best price pretty well
bought like five thousand 99 cents now
the patty looks it looks like meat it
does have kind of like a cat food smell
my sister says but it's pretty good once
you cook it up and add some toppings to
it this has 20 grams of protein and the
back says it has a total carbohydrates
of 5 grams and the dietary fiber of 3
grams so 5 minus 3 is 2 so this is 2 net
carbs for the patty and it just has 20
grams of protein so you could definitely
get your protein from this one it just
is not real meat but it does what a nice
- but let me show you guys what the
patty looks like I have one that I had
open it kind of looks like this it does
have like a cat food smell to it but
like I said you seasoned it up and then
you put cheese on it and stuff like
and it tastes good but it does look like
a burger you see that and you can get
this out Whole Foods for like $5.99 for
it to pack two pieces with just a little
bit steep but it's really good
another thing that I wanted to show you
guys today is these bagels that I
actually ordered from California now I
don't know if you guys ever heard of
this company especially if you're on
keto this is a great company to purchase
your stuff from so this is the great low
carb bread company and they're based in
California so they sell like bagels they
sell pasta they sell bread crumbs they
sell everything that's like really like
maybe like one net carb two net carbs
it's really really low so this is their
everything bagel and I suggest and
recommend getting everything bagel just
because the flavors make it taste better
these bagels do have like a Styrofoam
type of taste but once you kind of like
dress it up the styrofoam taste will
kind of fade a little bit so this is 120
calories 6.6 grams of fat
it has 16 grams of carbs and it has 14
grams of fiber
so obviously simple math 16-14 means
that this entire bagel is too net carbs
so to neck cups of the bagel and to for
the burger equals four net carbs in
total right now for the meal I'm gonna
add toppings on but I'll show you guys
how I calculate the toppings to make it
a complete burger so therefore I'm not
gonna be dipping into the ten net carbs
for this meal it's going to be like in
the 7 or 6 range of net carbs so this
tastes good I'm gonna actually heat it
up and stuff like that and show you guys
what it looks like so while my burgers
actually cooking right now I'm gonna
show you guys the condiments that I got
so I don't have place cheese but I do
have shredded cheese so I'm gonna use
shredded cheese now it says for 1/4 cup
that it's 1 grams of carb but I'm not
gonna use that much is gonna sprinkle a
little bit on there so we're just going
to say it's like point five carbs I
guess whatever so I'm gonna use a little
bit of this on it just a little bit just
to get it like a cheesy coat now I'm
going to use Mayo as well - now you can
use a Hellmann's manual the olive oil or
mayonnaise dressing now this one is
negative it's less than 1 gram carb so
therefore this is basically nothing if
you wanna like lather your food in mail
you can because it's a fat product it's
not a carbohydrates type product so
definitely go crazy with the olive oil
it's pretty good now I like pickles I
got some pickles now the pickles are
five chips of the pickles are one gram I
get four but I'm just gonna call it 1
gram because it doesn't matter so
there's only one net carb for this one
um so that's not bad either and these
taste pretty good on the burger I'm also
gonna use those jalapenos again and like
I said before 17 slices of jalapenos one
net carb but we're not going to use 17
slices we'll use about maybe like three
so that's I'm not gonna count that one
net carpet this one's now with the
ketchup you got to be careful here at
the grocery store buying ketchup regular
ketchup has a lot of sugar in it which
obviously is the same thing as cars so I
got the reduced sugar 175 percent less
sugar now this one is actually one
tablespoon of this one is one net carb
so this is gonna be good I don't need a
line just need a little bit just to
lather the burger up and make it taste
good so I'm gonna check on the burger
right now and I'll be right back
alright guys so here it is in the flesh
so this is the beyond burger so I only I
added avocado Mayo ketchup pickles
jalapenos one leaf of lettuce and a
little bit of cheese on the burger and
the bun like I said this bun is from the
great Lok whatever I'll do I'll link it
down below definitely check them out if
you guys want recipes for products that
they sell I can create some recipes for
you guys because the stuff is pretty
good it's not gonna be exactly like
bread rice pasta and stuff like that
but once you adapt to those types of
taste buds you'll be fine it's just the
same so I'm gonna bite this and tell you
guys what I think all right guys we're
gonna take a bite it's probably gonna
fall apart but I'm gonna do my best to
grab like as much stuff on it it's
pretty juicy hmm
mmm this was your pub burger bro a
little more cheese on it but it's pretty
good I overdo this bread the bread was
almost like burnt whistlin one more bite
okay so it's pretty good I'm going to
show you guys right now the bun is
actually pretty small compared to the
burger but this is what the burger looks
like some people want to know close up
with the burger looks like let me see if
I can get as close as possible so that's
what the patty looks like it's actually
pretty good why is it focusing on me and
not the burger dumb but but it's pretty
good though guys so yeah so that
basically was what I ate in a day like I
told you guys sometimes I don't even eat
three meals so I'll try to eat as much
of a protein based meal so that I'm full
like these are recipes that I create so
you can eat plain eggs if you want you
can have the burger without the bread if
you want to order from this company I'll
leave a link down below but so far I've
been using this company for like the
last two months and they've been pretty
good so their stuff is pretty solid
like I said when you first try this
stuff out guys it's gonna taste like
styrofoam and you're gonna be like what
the hell is this but if you're trying to
do a new lifestyle trying to join a new
lifestyle stuff like that you kind of
just have to adjust to different things
which I'm adjusting to and I'm pretty
happy so guys I will leave all the
information down below if you're
interested in the bread that I showed
you guys today and I'll leave it down in
the recipes and ideas of what I did and
if you guys want recipe videos of like
kind of like maybe like a pesto penne or
whatever or like a baked macaroni and
cheese that's keto friendly low-carb
just leave your comments down below and
I can do those videos for you as well
now guys do not forget thumbs up this
video leave your comments down below
subscribe and share this video with your
friends and family people and I will get
you guys
