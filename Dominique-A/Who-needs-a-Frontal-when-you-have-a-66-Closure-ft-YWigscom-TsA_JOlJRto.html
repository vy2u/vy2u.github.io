all right people so this is the final
look of the hair so this here was
actually sent to me from a company
called white wigs calm so they do salt
wigs guys but this was actually bundle
here and a closure that was sent to me
so I created my own unit for this
company now this unit guys that I
created is so pretty now number one the
hair that they sent me was a body wave
textured here so they send me two
bundles of 22 inches one 21 18 and a 16
inch 3 6x6 closure now this is the first
time I've ever worked with a 6x6 closure
guys and I can honestly say I am so in
love with the 6x6 closure now I do like
using frontals when I'm kind of making
my own units but the issue with frontals
sometimes is that it never fits or let's
see 25% of the time the front row is
gonna fit and you have to do like a lot
of cutting of it and kind of rearranging
it to kind of get to fix it fit your
head so I kind of feel like I prefer
frontals on our front old style wigs
just kind of pre-made for me instead of
me creating by myself now that I
discovered this 6x6 closure guys I am in
heaven now the 6x6 closure guys is about
let's see and goes from about right here
to just about right here so it's super
duper big it's basically almost the size
of an actual frontal but you don't have
the air type area and kind of like a
little bit of it on the sides right here
which is fine because sometimes I don't
utilize the frontal for those purposes I
usually just utilize the frontal for the
parting space and a little bit of
realistic vibes in the front now with
this unit that I created guys I didn't
go in and tweeze the frontal it did come
pre tweeze and I kind of pulled the baby
hairs out and then kind of pluck some
baby hairs off with my hand
unfortunately I cannot find my tweezers
right now so what I probably end up
doing is going back in and kind of
pulling some here out of this shaft area
right here so what I tried to do is kind
of give you guys more of a realistic
vibe but I kind of laid it down to give
you guys more like a clean fresh kind of
beauty style glam look now I really
really really love this here guys it's
super duper plush I didn't do anything
to the hair as far as co-washing and I
actually just sewed it on and left it
the way it was what I did do was use my
curling iron from Hot Tools and I just
basically ran through this with just
some light curls
just to kind of make sure that it
matched I do like the texture and I like
how it's very Bluff
I did get step four bundles guys I used
about three and a half know three and a
quarter bundles the 22 inch bundles were
actually able so there's a lot here in
the 22 inch bundles which is actually
surprising the 22 inch length is pretty
true to size it goes right where my
belly button is and it couldn't actually
be mistaken as a 24 as well too so
that's one of the thing now this is very
full hair guys when I mean full hair
it's super like like look at that it's
super duper full and you guys can see
why I didn't go ahead and kind of
co-wash this or kind of straighten that
out or anything else to it because the
wave pattern on this hair is so freakin
gorgeous like I love this so much so
I've tried to do kind of like a little
flip over kind of like you know a little
flip over kind of you know bouffant
style it does need a little bit of
texturizing spray in this area in here
on the closure just because it's not as
buff of us as I like so I'll probably go
and in tweezers or kind of add some dry
shampoo texturizing spray just to kind
of lift that area up but I do like this
a lot as far as curling guys I feel like
a dust curl but it doesn't hold a curl
too well I kept going in and doing like
little curl on sets to the front area
here especially this area right here and
I kind of feel like it will hold the
curl for like a second and then it'll
drop even after I use hairspray so I
hope that this hair is not a complete
fail when it comes to curling because I
really do like and I think it will look
fabulous to some curls in it I'm not
really like a straight hair person
unless the hair is like jet-black
and super duper long then I'll wear it
straight in the middle part and like you
know popping like that but I do like
this so far guys it's very very lovely
very pretty
my sister came upstairs and saw and she
was like yo that is it now one thing I'm
probably going to do is wear this when I
go away to London in two days I just
think it's a nice hairstyle to travel
with it's kind of low maintenance you
really don't have to do much I don't
receive any shedding or tangling so far
with this unit it's just giving me so
much a life right now so guys I'll leave
all the information down below if you
want to purchase this hair from why
