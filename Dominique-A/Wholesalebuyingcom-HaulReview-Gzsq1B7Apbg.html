I'm coming to do a quick review and this
reviews from a company called wholesale
buyers calm and they contact me through
my youtube channel and asked me if I
wanted to review a couple of their
products so I did agree so it's going to
be two clothing items and it's going to
be to make up items that I've taught
from them and I was able to choose these
by myself everything is very expensive
the only thing about the website is if
you do live in the United States you
will be paying for the FedEx or the
detail shipping and it does go by the
size and the size of the package that
you order so make sure you check that
out when you're actually picking the
stuff up because sometimes the rates
change depending on how big the package
is so if you're interested in this video
stay tuned and keep on watching alright
guys so basically I'm going to start off
with the makeup items that i got like i
said to you guys this website is very
inexpensive and it's most likely it's a
it's kind of like address linked com a
rom we r c and d direct all those asian
based websites everything is really
really cheap you can find clothing items
for under like four dollars or three
dollars which i really like but like i
said you have to keep in mind that when
you're purchasing stuff on this website
the more products you get the more the
shipment is because they go by the
weight of the package so when you're
shopping on these types of websites just
keep that in mind so the first i'm going
to show you that this is brush that i
got and if you ever go on I've been on
rom-com or dressing calm they have this
exact same set and they're this that was
about like five dollars I will link down
the links for all of these items down
below for you guys if you guys are
interested in them this is just a basic
brush set it has a face brushes and it
has the eye brushes it's like a
synthetic it's actually synthetic hair
it's very soft I might admit if you're
like hypoallergenic or you have like
sensitive skin maybe these types of
brushes would it be for you but these
brushes are very soft um and I'm not
sure I mean I know the names of the line
told me they know the names of these
brushes but if you're like a makeup geek
or a brush teeth and you know the names
of these brushes we have a flat brush
this little angle e brush whatever but I
just needed some new base foundation
brushes so I can use these especially
this flat top one as a foundation brush
and also the eyeshadow brushes you can
never have
too many eyeshadow brushes so I felt
like these brushes will be perfect for
my I settle collection and they kind of
replicate the face brushes as well like
I said they're very sturdy um I just got
white because all my brushes are kind of
black place brushes I thought it was
cute with the gold trim at the top of it
so yeah this is the first set that I got
it was under five dollars the next for
us that I got is just a single brush and
this is basically like a stippling brush
that you can use this for foundation or
what have is just a plain simple black
from stippling brush it is synthetic as
well I'm not getting any frame from
these brushes so none of it well I lied
I got one piece but am I getting like
major frame from the brush it is
synthetic so um I mean you're going to
get some fraying off of it it is very
soft on the to the touch and like I said
if you have sensitive skin you probably
should stay away from brushes like this
just because it can render some like
sensitivity to your skin so this is good
for the price and I think this was about
like two dollars for this brush so the
clothing items that I got has got to I
got um this top and this talks just
basically a tart and / checker top and
it's like an oversized shirt this I did
get it in a 2x and I'm going to make a
real quick disclaimer for you guys right
now or just a kind of a notice if you
are a curvier size women meaning if you
have curves and both spots of your body
like upper and lower spots you need to
make sure that you order the clothes and
a bigger bigger size I am a United
States medium to large and tops and I
wear a size 10 to 12 in pants when
you're buying tops from this website
because it's Asian base getting a size
large or medium at the top will not fit
so I basically had to get the shirts in
extra-large or at double X 2 X so keep
that in mind because Asian science is
like infinitely skinny size so you just
got to be careful when you're purchasing
these items from this website so i went
with the size 2x and this is supposed to
be kind of like an oversized t-shirt if
you aren't like a bit skinnier than I am
this would be kind of like a dress on
you but I'm
wanker beer down below so therefore this
cannot just be worn without like
anything underneath it has to be worn
with your leggings jeans or what have
you but I really like because it has
these cute little pockets right here it
is oversized on the top portion I'm just
saying it doesn't cover the bottom so
you do get an oversized look on this
which I really like and it's like a nice
it feels really nice and soft and the
construction is very nice I don't see
any of the stitching coming up I always
make sure to check that just because
when you order sent and products you
start seeing stitching coming out and I
don't like that so this is well
constructed buttons all the way down and
like I said you can wear this with a
variety of things for the winter time
and this is probably my favorite piece
so I really like this out of the two
pieces that I got so the last item that
I got is this cute little clapper topper
and it's like I put it on its hanger it
has an open sleeve on this side and it's
like a really skinny crop top material
it's kind of shared looking but I wear
black falls within anyways I wouldn't go
out with no Broncos I nips will be
showing but it's like a really sheer
material like this but here's the
problem this is a asian size large and I
did not ask them for an Asian size large
I asked for an Asia size XL but when
you're getting products from your view
why am I going to argue with you just
send the product to me and it is what is
when I got the product I realized that
the size was large which is not going to
fit guys my arms will not fit in this
little skimpy thing I mean I got myself
into the shirt but when it came time to
covering over the breasts it did not
work this does not it's just not just
does not cover my boobs I just can't
like it's too tight and in my hand like
okay let me try to lose like five to ten
pounds and then I'm going to retry this
again so to see if it fits but it does
not fit like I'm telling you guys right
now if you guys are curvier girls do not
buy the large or medium size asian go
for the extra-large of the 2x and Asian
size because it's just not going to fit
yeah guys this just basically wraps up
the video it's a quick video i just got
sent like a couple items nothing major
nothing big but like i said other than
the sizing problem just make sure you
check out for it you watch out for the
sizing you just don't want to order
something
get it and the size doesn't fit and then
you have to send it back so just keep
that in mind when you're purchasing all
for these asian websites the brushes are
cool and everything like that probably
feature them in another makeup video for
you guys States and see it I would love
to do a Q&amp;amp;A video so if you guys can
