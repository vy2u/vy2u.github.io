I'm coming to do a quick review and this
reviews from a company called wholesale
buyers calm and they contact me through
my youtube channel and asked me if I
want to review a couple of their
products so I did agree so it's gonna be
two clothing items and it's gonna be two
makeup items that I've taught from them
and I was able to choose these by myself
everything is very inexpensive the only
thing about the website is if you do
live in the United States you will be
paying for the FedEx or the detail
shipping and it does go by the size and
the size of the package that you order
so make sure you check that out when
you're actually picking the stuff up
because sometimes the rates change
depending on how big the package is so
if you're interested in this video stay
tuned and keep on watching guys so
basically I'm gonna start off with the
makeup items that I got like I said to
you guys this website is very
inexpensive and it's most likely it's a
it's kind of like a dress Ling calm
around we are CND direct all those Asian
based websites everything is really
really cheap you can find clothing items
for under like $4 or $3 which I really
like but like I said you have to keep in
mind that when you're purchasing stuff
on this website the more products you
get the more the shipment is because
they go by the weight of the package so
when you're shopping on these types of
websites just keep that in mind
so the first thing I'm gonna show you
guys this is brush that I got and if you
ever go on I've been on Rahui calm or
dressing calm they have this exact same
set and they're this that was about like
five dollars I will link down the links
for all of these items down below for
you guys if you guys are interested in
them this is just a basic brush set it
has a face brushes and it has the eye
brushes it's like a synthetic it's
actually synthetic hair it's very soft I
might admit if you're like
hypoallergenic or you have like
sensitive skin maybe these types of
brushes wouldn't be for you but these
brushes are very soft and I'm not sure I
mean I know the names of the well I
don't really know the names of these
brushes but if you're like a makeup geek
or a brush geek and you know the names
of these brushes we have a flat brush
this little angle II brush whatever but
I just needed some new base foundation
brushes so I can use these especially
this flat top one as a foundation brush
and also the eye shadow brushes you can
never have
too many eyeshadow brushes so I felt
like these brushes will be perfect for
my eyeshadow collection and they kind of
replicate the face brushes as well like
I said they're very sturdy
I just got white because all my brushes
are kind of black clay brushes I thought
it was cute with the gold trim at the
top of it so yeah this is the first set
that I got it was under five dollars
the next brush that I got is just a
single brush and this is basically like
a stippling brush that you can use this
for foundation or what have is just a
plain simple black from stippling brush
it is synthetic as well I'm not getting
any frame from these brushes so none of
it well I lied I got one piece but am I
getting like major fraying from the
brush it is synthetic so um I mean
you're gonna get some fraying off of it
it is very soft on the to the touch and
like I said if you have sensitive skin
you probably should stay away from
brushes like this just because it can
render some like sensitivity to your
skin so this is good for the price and I
think this was about like two dollars
for this brush so the clothing items
that I got is got two I got um this top
and this starts just basically a tartan
slash checker top and it's like an
oversized shirt this I did get it in a
2x and I'm gonna make a real quick
disclaimer for you guys right now or
just a kind of a notice if you are a
curvier sized woman meaning if you have
curves and both spots of your body like
upper and lower spots you need to make
sure that you order the clothes and a
bigger bigger size I am a United States
medium to large and tops and I wear a
size 10 to 12 and pants when you're
buying tops from this website because
it's Asian base getting a size large or
medium at the top will not fit so I
basically had to get the shirts in extra
large or double x 2x so keep that in
mind because Asian science is like
infinitely skinny size so you just got
to be careful when you're purchasing
these items from this website so I went
with the size 2x and this is supposed to
be kind of like an oversized t-shirt if
you aren't like a bit skinnier than I am
this would be kind of like a dress on
you but I am
way curvier down below so therefore this
cannot just be worn without like
anything underneath it has to be worn
with your leggings jeans or what have
you but I really like because it has
these cute little pockets right here it
is oversized on the top portion I'm just
saying it doesn't cover the bottom so
you do get an oversized look on this
which I really like and it's like a nice
it feels really nice and soft and the
construction is very nice I don't see
any of the stitching coming up I always
make sure to check that just because
when you order set and prod as you start
seeing stitching coming out and I don't
like that so this is what constructed
buttons all the way down and like I said
you can wear this with a variety of
things for the winter time and this is
probably my favorite piece so I really
like this out of the two pieces that I
got so the last item that I got is this
cute little clapper topper and it's like
I put it on this hanger it has an open
sleeve on this side and it's like a
really skinny crop top material it's
kind of sheer looking but I wear black
bras with it anyways I wouldn't go out
when no Broncos line if so be showing
but it's like a really sheer material
like this but here's the problem this is
a Asian size large and I did not ask
them for an Asian size large
I asked for a ninja size XL but when
you're getting products from your view
why am I gonna argue with you just send
the product to me and it is what it is
when I got the product I realized that
the size was large which is not gonna
fit guys my arms will not fit in this
little skimpy thing I mean I got myself
into the shirt but when it came time to
covering over the breasts it did not
work this does not it's just not just
does not cover my boobs I just can't
like it's too tight and in my hand like
okay let me try to lose like five to ten
pounds and then I'm gonna retry this
again so to see if it fits but it does
not fit like I'm telling you guys right
now if you guys are curvier girls do not
buy the large or medium sized Asian go
for the extra large or the 2x and Asian
size because it's just not gonna fit
yeah guys this just basically wraps up
the video it's a quick video I just got
sent like a couple items nothing major
nothing big but like I said other than
the sizing problem just make sure you
check out for it you watch out for the
sizing you just don't want to order
something
get it and the size doesn't fit and then
you have to send it back so just keep
that in mind when you're purchasing off
of these Asian websites the brushes are
at : everything like that I'll probably
feature them in another makeup video for
you guys so you can see it I would love
to do a Q&amp;amp;A video so if you guys can
