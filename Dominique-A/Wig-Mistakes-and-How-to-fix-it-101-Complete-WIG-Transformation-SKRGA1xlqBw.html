got seen here the Aeron in the back it's
really hot in my room so I had to just
blast that up so today basically a Matar
as you can tell I'm coming back today to
fix a mistake on a wig so if you watched
my last week Wednesday video and I'll
attach it up here somewhere I did kind
of mess up the part really bad so
basically what I did was I redid the
whole entire unit and I'm coming back
today to show you guys how to fix a
mistake on a unit now the color and
everything was great but the parting
space was terrible and I did read your
comments and I do take the comments into
consideration regardless of this
negative or positive I want you guys to
put your comments down if it's
constructive criticism I do take that
into consideration the other comments
some things slide off me like butter I
don't care but you do got you guys did
give me some constructive criticism on
the unit so I wanted to come back and
show you guys how I fixed it this is a
Learning Channel so I'm not a
professional so I'm trying to show you
guys how to fix it if you guys had the
same issue I did go and read I the wig
with the color 37 deep burgundy from
Revlon color silks so the hair is not
the same color but the style is cute the
color is cute and the parting space is
not tragic anymore so if you guys are
interested in seeing how I fix this wig
I would like you to stay tuned and keep
on watching
[Laughter]
alright guys so this is the final result
of the hair and what I've done with it
I am totally totally satisfied with this
look it almost looks like I went back to
like a black or natural color and Bob
look but I have to come close to show
you guys it is a deep burgundy color
obviously the other color has pulled
through some ways through so therefore
you'll get like a little bit of lighter
spots which kind of looks like an ombre
effect in a way it's really really
pretty guys it's like a nice deep
burgundy and I just love it I kind of
wish I would originally went with this
color but me bleaching it the first time
around showed you guys a potential of
this week company so this is the second
color process that I did on this hair
and the hair is still to its fame and
glory like it's like I really don't know
what to tell you guys if this video is
not how to fix a wig when you it up
kind of video then I don't know what to
tell you guys because this week is
completely different from the last week
that I did and I'm actually really proud
of myself because I kind of usually I
start giving up after a while so I
didn't give up this time and I transform
the way to something that is really nice
really fall inspired and I'm very very
happy I did go fix the parting space I
did a curved part this time and I just
added a tiny bit of powder and I didn't
use mascara this time to kind of play
with the part which worked out perfect I
did do baby hairs this time around the
perimeter just to make it a little bit
more fancy but overall guys I'm very
satisfied with this unit I did go on and
trim just a tiny bit on the ends to give
myself more of a clean blunt instead of
that kind of messy bun that I had before
I do like it curled what I noticed with
this hair is that when it's wash it does
have a natural wave because it is body
wave so that's one good thing about the
body waves texture from our VG air it
does have a really natural body with
texture when you wet it so if you want
to wet this it'll come out kind of like
a nice wavy look and just add like some
products to kind of keep the wave and
it'll be really pretty but for now I do
like the straight look I think it looks
really nice clean and fresh for the Fall
so I'm really really happy and I'm
really happy and proud of myself for
redoing this this is a Learning Channel
guys so I'm happy to help so I hope this
video helps you guys it is hard when
you're coloring hair you make mistakes
and you almost did
you failed completely but I actually
came through with this unit guy so I'm
very very happy I hope you guys enjoy
