gonna be just another hair of you now in
today's hair of you I'm reviewing a hair
from a company off of Amazon called
Maxine here calm well calm yeah so they
hear that I'm reviewing is a 360 frontal
with three bundles I got a 20 inch
frontal and 3 22 inch bundles and I've
installed all bundles and the frontal on
a dome cap like I usually do this is the
first time I ever got it 360 frontal and
this was probably one of the worst
experiences hair experiences that I've
had up to date um the company contacted
me and I went to the website I thought
it was pretty good the products was
pretty outstanding some look okay let me
try this out this is the first time I've
ever ever reviewed a company from Amazon
so that probably was my first red flag
not a lot of people review Amazon
companies I don't even know why I
accepted that offer but I did it and
yeah so this is the hair that I have on
right now you guys can see the front oh
it's a two braids in it did tweeze the
the front and stuff like that so right
now it looks really good
which eye part I came on camera making
it look good the hair is naturally
straight so what I do is that deep wave
deep waving was the only way I can
maintain a proper functioning unit this
is the only way the hair is going to
function correctly is if it's deep waves
and you don't toss and turn with the
hair no the major problem that I had
with this hair is that the hair sheds so
much and not only do the bundle shed but
the frontal itself sheds as well so
you're thinking that you're gonna lose
hair from the bundles okay I get it
all hair sheds but when you start
getting bald spots in the frontal then
it's kind of like wow okay so usually
when you go to close your and stuff it
you don't have to worry cuz usually the
company will kind of seal the knots or
whatever on the on the frontal and stuff
like that me I'm thinking like that
maybe the company is gonna do that they
did none of that stuff so they basically
put the hair on the little lace and then
dropped it in the mail bus and gave it
to you I was not sent this I was sent
this here for review so therefore some
people are under the impression that
youtubers get hair sitting here for free
and it's the best here that the
ever get and they lie to the the buyers
and tell of the subscribers oh the hair
is absolutely good and when they ordered
the hair it's garbage well that wasn't
the case for me I am a cus I'm a
customer basically so I got the garbage
here and I'm not even thinking that I'm
mowing like that we'll get the garbage
here everyone will get the garbage here
because the hair is garbage I would not
recommend anyone purchasing here from
this company they would really have to
set their cookies up in order to get a
buy from anyone like this was one of the
worst experience ever and mind you I
didn't spend my money on this had I
spent my money on this hair I would have
flipped the on these
like seriously cuz like a front on three
bundles that's gonna cost you a lot of
coins right there and nobody's about to
waste their hard-earned hard only coins
on some piece of and this is
garbage so with all due respect and with
highly recommending you guys do not
purchase this hair from this company
what I used to do when I first started
YouTube was I used to type in in the
search engine the companies before I
purchased the hair because a lot of
people on YouTube make reviews for all
these online China based company so I
would just check before before I had to
eat or just check to see if this club
this companies done this companies do
this you know
so before you're purchasing here from
these overseas countries just type in
that YouTube search engine then it'll
companies and see what other people have
to say about it before you purchase it
so before you buy this here from Amazon
make sure you click on my video just to
be aware and this is just a heads up
anyways if you haven't shopped on Amazon
for hair check out the videos on YouTube
about Amazon hair companies or check
that out express based companies before
you purchase the hair because you don't
want to spend your money on garbage my
360 experience was good though I was
able to manufacture the wig correctly
and stuff like that however the hair is
no good what I'm probably going to do is
take the bundles you know what I don't
even know what I'm gonna do with this
 honestly it sheds less when it's
just in a wavy state like this where I'm
not playing with it if you try to
straighten this out for and get it if
you try to curl it forget it so the only
way it will maintain a proper you know a
proper look is if you braid
would do some little funny thing on the
front and just deep wave it in a deep
wave leave it like that and spray with
hairspray so this is basically how I
rocked it for now just that's just it
so I would not recommend this here and I
don't want you guys to waste your money
I didn't want to come and give you guys
an honest review just to let you guys
know there are the good parts of stuff
and there's the bad part of stuff and I
obviously have interacted with the bad
part so just as a heads up beware guys
so if you have any questions or comments
you can leave them down below in the
comments section
make sure you thumbs up this video and
also subscribe if you have it and I will
catch you guys later bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
