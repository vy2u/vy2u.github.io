doing a review on my best lace wigs wig
and this Lilly swear as you can tell
this wig is the swo 82 and it's a 20
inch 1b so basically my view on this wig
is that you know I do like the way get
everything it's nice it's long the curls
are really nice when you do straighten
it and wet it back the co-star right
back to normal the only problem I see
with this leg is that the wig
does she like I mean all here basically
shuts even though I got the box and it
told me that the wig was shed free it
sheds like crazy but I mean after you
wash it and put products in it it'll the
curls would just jump right back and
then it looks kind of full I'm not sure
you could tell and you can see the wave
pattern right here which is really nice
but pretty much the curls do come back
and then it gives you the volume that
you had we first got some of my products
that I do use on this here are the
Garnier Fructis style curls sculpting
cream gel this is really good it has
bouncy curls and frisk control and it's
extra strong I usually wash my hair
first and then I just you know after I
wash it then I put the stuff in it I put
that in in the scrunch it from the
bottom as you can tell it's really long
then I scrunch up from the bottom up and
that's about it another product that I
did use because my mom actually has
really nice curly and natural curly hair
because my mom is medics so she uses the
carefree curls snapback and that one
actually works on her hair because her
hair is naturally curly for me I use
that on my weave too and it's really
good it's so it keeps the hair moist you
know it's like moist about the whole day
not dry and like stale like house
gelling it the only thing I would say
about the garnet few teeth thing is that
you don't get crusty air usually we use
certain gels your hair is really crusty
but this one snark crusty at all um what
I buy from this place again uh yeah I
would watch this place again only you
know they you know
just like Miss wags I bought a Miss wigs
wig horrible I mean I'm not saying is
that's my opinion I've seen a lot of
reviews that a lot of people have said
you know miss wigs is good and stuff
like that but for my opinion
miss wigs from the when you first when I
first received the win the wig was
beautiful the wig was flawless it was
beautiful but after a couple wears and a
couple washes the way became so so so so
rough and it half so it wasn't soft
curls anymore it was like really rough
and stuff like that
so therefore if I'm if I want to buy
another way from here I'm not sure you
know I heard that they're you know
improving the wig styling caps and stuff
like that so it doesn't shed because
that one really did show but for my
experience is shopping at wigs for a
good price at this I only paid a hundred
and forty five dollars you know one
hundred and fifty five dollars for this
or a five dollar discount coupon on it
so therefore for a twenty inch lace
front which is about three inches of
parting space up there there for the
price that's pretty good and I actually
would buy to me again because if you're
a diva on a budget that's where it's at
so good price right there so yes I
actually would buy from this place again
I mean that's just my opinion as far as
I'm concerned I'm not paid to do you
know do videos on this kind of stuff
this is just me giving you guys my
honest and true opinion about the wake
and thanks guys
