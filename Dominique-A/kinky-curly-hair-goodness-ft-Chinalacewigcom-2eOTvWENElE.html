with another wig video
so today's wigs videos watch you guys
from China lace wigs calm so today I'm
showing you guys a 24 inch long 360
kinky curly wig now this is my first
time ever doing the kinky curly wig so
I'm really kind of nervous because kinky
curly is a very specific distinct type
of texture and sometimes it's really
hard to kind of style this kind of curls
so I hope that this one comes out nice
so what I'm not gonna do with this when
it's cold watch the unit I'm just going
to basically take it out the pack fix
the baby here it's kind of play with it
a little bit and glue it down and then
kind of see where it goes from there I
am gonna wipe to komen up because I
noticed that the curl pattern on this
one is really really pretty so I want to
kind of bring it out more so I'm gonna
comb it out just to give it more of a
big puffy cute and fun vibe I do like it
like I said it's really really long 24
inches it's a very very full about 150
hundred eighty percent density and I
believe all the specs down below if I'm
incorrect but it is a bit dense guys and
I think it's really full and nice so you
won't need to feel like you don't have
enough hand the back so it's definitely
definitely full enough to that effect it
does come with your sander three combs
at the top two on the sides one at the
base along with a comb in the back and
adjustable straps so it's your standard
360 cap and what 360 is you just about
get like about 4 to 6 inches of parting
space in the front and then you get 2
inches in the back so I'm gonna keep
this one simple I'm just gonna kind of
do like a part-time in middle or that
kind of like a jagged zigzag part down
the middle and add some powder glue the
baby hairs down and come to you guys
just like that and let's see if this one
works and I'm kind of nervous because my
first time with this texture so I'm
hoping that it's yes so guys if you're
interested in seeing what this looks
like I would like you to stay
alright guys so this is what the unit
looks like from China lace wigs calm I
think that this unit is so so cute guys
now initial indifference got the texture
I was kind of trying to figure out what
I was going to do so in the beginning if
you watch I did kind of try to put it in
the middle part but the middle part for
me was kind of this hair needs something
better than that and I don't like
sometimes when you do curly hair and you
flatten it out in the middle and then
you kind of have this hair just kind of
coming out of nowhere so I felt like
doing a flip over instead was kind of
more realistic for this type of pattern
and this type of look so I like it with
just kind of like the flip over method
look and just kind of letting the hair
be free and fun this hair is definitely
definitely really pretty guys and one
thing I was thinking in my head is that
adding some color to this will take it
to another level so I'm definitely gonna
consider coloring this just to give it
more of an uppity that a vampire hype or
whatever you want to call it just
because it's really pretty and I think
it has a lot of fun so by construction
guys this wig is constructed really well
it does have the two combs on the side
one at the base and one at the back and
the ear tabs actually laid down pretty
well with the the combs
I will linked on other information as
far as the cap construction the wig size
cap size and all that stuff I have a
pretty small head so this one fit me
really well and I don't know I just
really like this is my first time trying
kinky curly hair and I think that this
looks fabulous I do want to come back
and tell you guys how it is when I had
Cole wash it because I don't want it to
lose this beautiful texture so I'm
crossing my fingers that I do not lose
any of this pretty kinky curly so guys I
will leave all the information down
below for you guys if you guys are
interested in this unit do not forget
guys to thumbs up this video leave your
comments down below subscribe and share
this video with your friends and family
