guys I'm coming today to do a review on
the new hair that I received from
aliexpress.com
and the vendor that I got my hair from
was sunny grace and if it's also I got
to call out alibaba.com Paulo because
you could get a like a lot of stuff in
there so the hair that I have today is a
virgin brazilian body wave here
I got an 18 inch button on the top then
I got a 22 inch bundle on the bottom so
it's pretty long as you guys can see I
ordered three bundles and I still have
the 16 inch bundle which I didn't even
use but I'm gonna save this here for
another install some other time and this
is what the hair looked like when it
came to the pack I washed it here and
then this is the body way that it has I
noticed that when you buy longer hair no
longer link that the hair is not as wavy
as a shorter length but I also do
braiding and I do twist it so you get a
little bit of a wave towards the end so
the 22 inch doesn't really wave that
well but it waves good enough but it's
good here I straighten the hair and I
curled it here
beautiful the only think about it it's
like really humid in Connecticut so
therefore you're going through like a
heat wave right now so leaving hair
straight it's gonna go back and wave up
anyway so I mean I just sweat it back I
watched in my hair one time I had this
heard for two weeks
okay when I ordered this hair it said
that it was three days shipping and I
received it in three days I ordered it
on Tuesday morning and I received the
friday friday morning this afternoon so
three days is fairly fast shipping I
paid one hundred and seventy two dollars
for three bundles which is a really good
price and what I basically did was I
didn't install and I took like a side
part and left by natural here on the top
and my little bitty head just on the
sides - and stuff like that
and I just did a regular sewing I am
gonna go and order closure off of the
same website Aliexpress calm just really
simple fact that it's really hot outside
and I do not feel like leaving having to
strain my hair everyday and I do not
want to damage my hair so I'm gonna go
and order
you order a lace lace closure just a
little piece just to act on the side
right here so that I do not have to
think my hair anymore because I don't
want to damage my hair okay so my
experience of this hair so far it's
really good here I haven't really
received like shedding twice with those
two strands when you put your hands to
the air there's no hair that comes out
the hair is really good like this is
some good hair I want to dive in here
but not until you know I got to wear it
out long enough to you know Express the
counter but this call is kind of too
dark for me I usually go for lighter
colors you know but this is really too
dark for me and I am gonna die
eventually but not now
but I probably died like a honey blonde
color or like a ruby red color towards
the ends just for their summery look but
um yeah the ear wax it's kind of thick
it's not too thin just can see that the
arrow F is like really good it's not
that it's real I didn't when I sold my
weave in I didn't cut any tracks I sold
it through the whole way so it's all
sewed in one way it's um I didn't cut
any of the tracks the only tracks I
caught was um towards the top but I grew
the tracks in towards on the top of my
head right hand and those are like the
only tracks that I um like uh other than
that the hair is the weft I mean I
figured like this if you don't cut the
wet the hair will not check so therefore
I haven't experienced shedding so
therefore maybe if you if I did cut the
whip I'm pretty sure she said because
the last kind of Indian here had it shut
like a dog so um I was kind of skeptical
about ordering from this website just
for the simple fact that I don't know
you know what kind of here I'm gonna get
I don't know what's gonna be like and I
was kind of skeptical like oh man if I
order this and does it turn out the way
I want it to be I'm screwed stuff like
that but at the end of the day that
ending result is really good if what I
order from this place again hell yeah
but I don't know yeah I don't know if I
water from it anytime soon maybe before
school time and this is a package to
here came then it came like an acute
little UPF practicing
whatever it's like too bright in here
you guys will be able to see it anyway
sorry that's my sister in the back right
now um but it was three days and it came
in this little bag and it came out of
these little plastic bags so this is my
second week with this here and so far
I'm really happy guys I think I'm gonna
order the closure maybe some tonight or
tomorrow morning or the corner cuz
they're probably coming on well coming
on Wednesday and that's perfect
imma get a nice like I don't know what
kind of clothes again I'm gonna just get
like a maybe wavey closure because the
top of my hair is more wavy than the
bottom so it'll blend fast easier so you
gonna go back on Aliexpress common order
myself a nice closure to place on the
top of my hand and plus my forehead
looks so bonkers right now that I just
need a cover and I'll put a little bit
of links right here so I am gonna go and
I'm gonna go in order um we're gonna go
and order lace closure soon but that's
far this is some pop in here and I like
this and I straighten it it was so so
social social names it was so nice a
nice training I really like this here
and the winding wise it blends to my
hair like pretty good
I'm right here it's probably kind of
greasy with no soul but it blends with
my hair pretty good song that's a good
thing
alright like I really really like this
hanger like this hair is the bomb I
think next time if I order here from
this website I'm gonna order it kind of
like a I'm gonna go 18 inch 20 long hair
it's not my thing
what long hair is my thing well not no
booty length hair like this is some
booty here like this is like some booty
length hair and plan I mean it is what
it is it's good here though song can't
front on that part so basically what I'm
gonna do is um I'm gonna order some more
here and well as my before I
order more here I'm gonna order the
closure see how that turns out and if
that turns out good then I'm gonna go
and order somewhere
towards the end of August before I start
school again
and that's about it but that's far this
is some good hair all I do this here is
wet it up I put a little bit of leave-in
conditioner and use the apogee condemned
leave-in conditioner then this
conditioner is good
you just put water in this I mix it with
water half and half because I don't have
that much left in here before when I
first started it so I just sleep like
half water and then half whatever left
of the conditioner and I just lay my
head so this morning when I took a
shower I whip my hair in the shower so
it's looking pretty it's looking pretty
sexy with her JK but um
alright guys so as you guys can see I'm
trying I'm trying to step my cookies up
with a crumble and I'm trying to put
more vidios up because I know people
want to see videos more and more videos
