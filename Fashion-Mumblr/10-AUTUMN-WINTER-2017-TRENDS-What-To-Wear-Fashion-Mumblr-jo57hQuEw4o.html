having a lovely weekend so far today I
thought I would do a really nice just
chilled chatty video all about the
upcoming trends for the autumn winter
2017 season so we have to really cast on
line back to the catwalks that we saw in
spring of this year feels like forever
ago but it's now that we're starting to
see the trends from those catwalks
coming into the high street and we are
slowly but surely starting to think
about what we're going to be wearing in
autumn winter so in today's video I'm
going to be sharing my top 10 trends and
these are trends that personally I feel
that I will get at least a little bit of
wear out of and I will briefly mention a
few of the other trends as well there's
a few that are slightly less wearable
but I picked out my top 10 favourite
thankfully a lot of the trends that
we're seeing this autumn winter are
actually trends that have been trendy in
previous seasons as well so for example
there's a big trend for oversized knits
and miniskirts about something that has
kind of always been around for year
after years so it's one trend that we're
not going to have to buy anything new
for thankfully and even fluted sleeves
you guys might remember if you've been
on my channel for a while how quickly I
had opted the OTT sleeve trend my first
big purchase was Beck's of Monaco jumper
and luckily for me and you guys as well
if you also invested in the OTT sleeve
trend it's coming back in this season so
we can work out our fabulous free
jumpers once again another thing that it
was really prevalent throughout the
catwalks is that this season it really
is all about fun I think that there's
was so much horribleness going on in the
world at the moment and the designers
wanted to use their clothes just bring a
little joy into our lives and use the
clothes to lift off spirits away from
the negative and very draining new so
we're going to be seeing lots of fun
that think pink faux fur jackets frills
feathers all that kind of detail and I'm
very much ok with that
we're also going to be seeing lots of
soft power dressing so it's all about
accentuating our femininity so things
like the aforementioned fabrics like
frills feathers floss that kind of thing
but also cinched in waist and that's
going to be achieved of things like
waist belts and coats a tie at the waist
as well another trend that I'm very much
excited to try alright so let's get
started with my top 10 trends of the
autumn
to 2017 season the first one which I
have already started that around with is
red to toe we saw so many designers
featuring red in the catwalks ranging
from Givenchy Max Mara Fendi even and it
really is the standout color of the
season personally I'm not sure I can
pull off a full red to toe look which is
of course head to toe red from the
blouse we dress the trousers and the
shoes but I have picked up some really
lovely red accessories one of which I
actually have right here it is this bag
and I think this looks so high-end in
designer but actually it was very
affordable and this is just one way so
I've been injecting the color of
receiving into my wardrobe but without
investing in a full outfit so any things
like this I mentioned we linked down in
scription box of course as well as I'm
wearing etc etc so yeah we're already
seeing the high street start to get a
few of these trends in red I've spotted
loads of red in Zara obviously
accessories and places like Topshop
River Island mango has some beautiful
red dresses in there so it's really easy
Chen that we can adopt fairly affordably
the second trend which I am quite
excited about is fancy tights so no
longer are tights going to be an
afterthought but they really are central
to your outfit one of my favorites was
the type shown at the mall B catwalk
they were kind of nervous but really
cool at the same time such an affordable
way to add a trend into outfit and once
again the high street is a great place
to find reef fun yet effective type to
just add a little bit more fun to your
outfit and as well as mulberry we saw
the crazy tie trend over at Saleem and
at Balenciaga as well as you can see
from the pictures on the cream another
trend that I'm really excited about is
feathers frills and faux fur that as I
mentioned earlier it's all about the
textures this autumn and this is
definitely one trend that I'm very much
excited by it's all about touchable
textures as opposed to patterns so print
patterns maybe a little bit of effort
print here and there but it's all about
those touchable fabrics
while I am still on the lookout for one
of those really lovely cozy teddy bear
jackets I have already invested in some
pink faux fur this one is from ASOS
and I just love the color it's almost
like a gray purple silver faux fur I
thought it was quite a mature way of
wearing the pink
so answer that another piece that I've
already picked up for the autumn winter
season trend number four is the maxi bag
so I don't think that we're going to be
seeing these summer mini bag trends
going away anywhere anytime soon but it
definitely is all about the maxi bag
this season I have actually also picked
one up already from Topshop which is
outfit beautiful and it also encompasses
the touch wall textures trend we saw
this trend on the catwalk from brands
such as Michael Kors Proenza Schouler
Jil Sander and also as loads of
interesting details like leather tied
into knots
tassels detailed stitching etc so
definitely look out with this kind of
thing once again on the high street
because they are already out in the shop
number five again I hinted this earlier
but all about the chunky knit and the
midi skirt this is a trend that I'm sure
most of us can pull out for my wardrobe
straight away without having to
fine-tune you it was Dior and Balenciaga
that really showed this off to the
maximum and personally I find midi
skirts to be the most flattering length
Topshop every Beach will keep two one in
at the moment which is also an
asymmetric hem tend of the car to really
show off your ankle boots or even
sandals well it's a little bit warmer
but the pair of strategy ankle boots is
definitely the greatest way to start
this trend trend number six is the artsy
boho dress resource
Alexander McQueen Gucci Valentino and
once again it's trend I'm really excited
about its way of injecting a lot more
femininity again into your autumn
wardrobe is definitely some 70s vibes
going on here but again it's a really
great way of transitioning your summer
maxi dresses into the autumn season
depending with some ankle boots and
leather jacket perhaps and waist belt
and your summer dresses instantly become
more for a bridge for the autumn season
you can make like Isabelle Mehran and
pair with some slouchy over knee boots
to take off another autumn winter trend
and what I really loved about this
China's that I'll refer to it as you
like couch pastels or couch florals yeah
I think it was couch florals they said
if you feel like your dress like your
grandma's living room then you've
probably got the trend right a few
pieces that I have already actually
behind me let me show you so this is a
dress that I have to be Topshop it is a
really good transition piece floral but
still perfect for that boho autumn trend
really nicely fish at the waist as well
and you've also got the frill texture
here so
speaking of two trends in one this would
ankle boots a black studded waist belt
to toughen it up perhaps a black leather
jacket which really hip nail on the head
for that particular autumn trend and
then my personal favorite is this one
from Zara it looks really sheer because
I've actually taken the slip out of it I
need to shorten straps but this color is
absolutely beautiful you've got it's
kind of mid calf level and then you've
got some smoking to really adds that
feminine silhouette really beautiful
soft material for a holds up against
where you can see the color a bit more
clearly but this is a really good one
for the coucher floral trend that we're
seeing and the maxi dress trend and the
feminine silhouette trend trend number
seven is actually a color another color
and it is periwinkle blue we saw this on
the catwalks in spring/summer and lean
at Valencia gir numu and once again
already sing it on the high street
I've seen some magazines and bloggers
calling it cobalt blue but personally I
think that anything on the section
between cobalt and periwinkle that blue
shade is really on trend I just really
like the words are you ankle but I find
it periwinkle in particular to be a lot
more muted and soft on the skin tone so
I've already invested in a periwink I
really gotta find that word periwinkle
I've already invested in a periwinkle
blue dress and I'm looking for maybe
some corduroy trousers in that color as
well or a suede skirt in that same shade
so I think it's very versatile and easy
to fit in to an autumn winter wardrobe
trend number eight is the womanly waist
so there's a bit of a wave of feminism
before the catwalk season started which
led to a lot of very powerful slogan
t-shirts and definitely some very
feminine power dressing to Louie Vuitton
do you're a mess they all cinched in the
waist choosing waist belt or if they
were going to wearing an oversized coat
they again would be pulled in at the
waist which again is a trend that I
absolutely do anything to enhance the
feminine silhouette is a good trend in
my book so I predict we're going to be
seeing a lot more wide belts on the high
street I've already seen a few in top
shops and like corset style ones and
this is really going to be emulating
what we saw on the catwalks number nine
is 70s fabric this last season we really
saw almost every era represented on the
catwalk so I think in 70s into what
stood out the most especially
when it came to fabrics we saw lots of
shearling lots of corduroy lots of denim
and lots of 70s floral prints one of my
17th favorites was Chloe L insert the
catwalk picture here as you can see the
look that I'm talking about but it's
just the florals and the colors in that
real caramel taupe e75 that I absolutely
adored personally I'm not too sure if I
will be going down the corridor each
aisle the route but I want to look out
for some autumnal corduroy skirts so
I'll keep you posted
if I find any of those I think that's a
really nice feminine way of wearing that
trend and then number 10 is belted coats
I have mentioned belting in your coat in
the feminine silhouette trend but belted
coats all together is its own trend this
autumn winter again another one I'm very
much excited about we saw this mostly at
Louis Vuitton and Miu Miu just really
adding a lot of femininity to that coat
whether it be a trench a wool cashmere
blend that just has a matching belt or
even a faux fur coat everything was
cinched in to really enhance the
feminine figure so those are my top 10
trends for the autumn winter 2017 season
