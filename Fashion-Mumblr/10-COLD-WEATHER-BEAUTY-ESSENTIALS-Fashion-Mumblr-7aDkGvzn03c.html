me for today's video it's going to be
all about my top ten cold-weather beauty
essentials so a couple of days ago I
filmed my top 10 cold-weather fashion
essentials a few of which you can see a
sneak peek behind me but if you missed
that then definitely check that one out
it's a really good one for winter basics
for wardrobe and I will leave that one
linked up on the screen and down below
but today we're going to be talking
about the beauty essentials that every
girl and guy maybe you should be using
internet these colder months we've got
10 to get through a few different
options for each as I did with the
fashion video I'm going to try to do an
affordable version and then a slightly
more premium version so I'm sure I'm
gonna get started by telling you about
the lipstick that I'm wearing it because
I will forget to put it in the
description box otherwise and I love it
so much it is the matte lipsticks number
1 from the Victoria Beckham for Estee
Lauder range and it is the perfect
winter brown I just love it so so much
so I thought I'd give a shout out said
that's the same color as the Victoria
lipliner which I have spoken about so
many times and I use pretty much every
single day so now I have the lipstick
version and I'm in love so while we're
talking about lips my first cold-weather
Beauty essential is a lip balm
personally I love balms you don't have
to put your finger into a pot because I
sometimes find that a little bit gross
and this one is from Liz Earle
it's her super skin super lip balm so
this is of course super nourishing great
for those bitterly cold days especially
if like me you always just come home
with chapped lips and you're craving
something really quenching to moisturize
and soothe the lips but this one also
visibly plumps lips too in fact
yesterday I had this on all day before
applying my usual lipstick and two
separate friends asked me if I had my
lips done and I was like nope it's
Alyssa lip balm the plumping doesn't
irritate the lips in any way though it
is the naturally active ingredients to
help to plump the lips so you've got a
Luria essential enter I'm gonna
completely budge this up pomegranate
seeds nourish dragon's blood extract
argan oil and shea butter to help
protect against dryness so that would be
my number one Beauty essential for the
cold weather it is a lip balm and my
favorite is this one from Alyssa
my next code where the Beauty essential
is a scrub I have an option
here's the face and also for the body
when it does get cold and windy and
horrible outside we often find our skin
getting a little bit dry so it's
important to buff the complexion and
make sure we still have a lovely glow to
our skin getting rid of any dead skin
cells this one from st. Ives if the face
is one of my favorites it's very
affordable this particular one is the
blackhead cleansing one which I find
really good I live really close to the
city I am in the center of London most
days I find this a really good one for
just dragging all the dirt out of my
skin and really helping to punish the
complexion too for the body my favorite
is the almond one from L'Occitane I love
the fragrance of this I love the size of
the particles and I'm very particular
about the size of the bits in my
exfoliating scrub of course no
microbeads this is the almond shell that
is actually scrubbing you and I find it
really nourishing as well so I don't
feel like my skin is super dry and tight
after using it so these would be my two
top choices for a scrub for the cold
months no matter how nourishing your
scrub you will need to moisturize after
you have exfoliated your body and you
really need to moisturize the body twice
a day during the cold winter months what
we often do is come inside from the cold
into the warmth and then we have a long
hot shower and that really dries out the
skin so to prevent your skin going dry I
would recommend moisturizing twice a day
these are two of my favorites the first
one is keels creme de corpse I feel like
it needs no introduction it's such a
classic product this is actually the
limited edition Cape morose and festive
version it's got a really nice sense
nothing too overpowering and it's one
that just keeps the body soft and
nourished for many many hours after I
use it I mean you can tell just from
looking at it that it's so scrumptious
and nourishing and I just don't have a
bad word to say about this so this is a
real staple piece of skincare for the
body for the colder months something a
little bit more luxurious a little bit
more of a treat is the tuberose
luxurious body cream from Erin so this
is a very luxurious body cream it smells
incredible it smells like there tuberose
fragrances which I adore and this one
just looks so fabulous in your bathroom
and of course it's an amazing amazing
body lotion that smells good that looks
very very pretty as well Erin branding I
just absolutely adore this is a body
lotion dye tend to save for special
occasions
when I'm going out for dinner I will lay
out this and then the perfume and it
just makes you smell incredible so
that's a lovely pampering version and
body creams are my third beauty son
short for the colder months next up is
fake tan we often find ourselves a
little bit pale and pasty during these
colder months so I like to keep my tan
topped up with a few of my favorite
pieces so we have the tan Lux sleep oil
I've mentioned this many times before
and this one you apply as an oil into
the palm of your hand press it onto the
face before bed you wake up with a
beautiful glow it works really well if
you want to just continually keep your
tan tops up and never have a real pale
and pasty face a really nice one for
regularly use it's got skincare in there
as well so you're not missing out on any
of the nourishing benefits of using a
different oil in the evenings unlike so
many fake tans especially facial fake
tans this one actually has an incredible
fragrance as well so big fan of that and
then fought the body I like to use what
to be honest I like to use a gradual tan
most days on my body to really keep it
going
I love the Bondi sun's gradual tan I
love the tan Lux gradual tan and I also
love the Garnier Ambre Solaire gradual
tan but what I like to do on my hands
and sometimes also a misting on my face
if it just needs a little bit of a boost
is use a spray-on fake tan the one that
I recommend to all of my friends is this
one is the terracotta sunless tan from
Guerlain it's a really lovely fine mist
that delivers the most beautiful color
not orange in the slightest so if you do
find that you're tons of more pale than
your body often that's the case because
we wash our hands more frequently then
you can just spend two seconds just have
this on your dressing table mist your
hands in fact I'm cloud League over to
your misting now it's just so so easy
here we go and that would just to help
ensure your tans are nice and bronzed
and they are always visible so it's nice
to have slightly more tan pounds you can
tell them I needed it this will take a
couple of hours and then I'll have a
lovely golden glow on my hand something
your skin will be very grateful for
during the colder months is a nourishing
face mask this one is the Vichy mask
mineral desert tough ones I think that's
how you pronounce it with her French
accent and but this is a really lovely
one filled with minerals I think it's
got like vitamin b3 in there yeah and
you basically applied this to the skin
the
absorbs all the goodness so good for dry
skin after a day if you've been outside
and wind and your skin is just feeling
like it needs a little bit of TLC this
is a really lovely one I usually let it
sit on my skin for about five minutes
and then rub the excess in it's great
because if you want to just get into bed
and pamper and then not get out of bed
again because you're all snuggled up
it's a really nice one you don't need to
rinse it off or anything just rub the
excess in and it'll just help make sure
your skin looks and feels its best and
getting all the minerals and vitamins
that it needs to keep looking at healthy
and glowing it throughout the winter my
next Beauty essential is a hand cream
this is another item from the L'Occitane
almond collection I just love that range
so much it's their hand and nail cream
I'm actually not going to put any on now
because it could do strange things to my
fake tan but hand cream I think is just
such an important handbag essential
during the colder months we often find
our hands getting chapped and dry so
it's nice to just have something you can
whip on this one doesn't leave your
hands feeling sticky or greasy
afterwards has a lovely fragrance very
nourishing and again I think it's got
almond oil and Shea in there you can use
this on the cuticles as well and it's a
good little size for popping in your
handbag I feel like L'Occitane is
definitely the go-to when it comes to
hand cream next up is a rich face
moisturizer and the one that I have
chosen is the creme de la Mer
moisturizing cream because I feel like
it just doesn't get any better than this
I've been using this for the past two
six weeks and already I'm totally hooked
I can totally see what all the hype is
about and it's perfect for this time of
year it's not gonna make the skin again
feel greasy or sit on the skin for a
long time instead you really feel like
your skin is appreciating all the
amazing ingredients in this very quickly
absorbed into the skin and instantly you
look like you've got a beautiful glow to
the complexion your skin feels great and
really comfortable all day long great
for under makeup and just keeps the skin
looking and feeling its best throughout
the entire day no matter whether you're
outside in the cold all day long or
inside and central heating this just
keeps the skin looking and feeling it's
very very best something else that's
very pampering for the complexion on the
face during the colder months is a
cleansing balm and I absolutely adore
the LMS pro-collagen the cleansing balm
that this is probably the most luxurious
way of taking off your makeup sometimes
I use this when I don't even have makeup
on I just want to pamper myself but I've
raved a lot
a lot about the LMS pro coach and range
as a whole and love the pro coach and
marine cream moisturizer and they're
dynamically servicing one also from the
range but this is just a super super
luxurious way to take your makeup off
it's just that incredible buttery
consistency applied onto the skin give
yourself a little bit of a face massage
enjoy the fragrance enjoy the silky
texture and then all your makeup comes
off as well if you haven't tried this I
would definitely recommend trying it out
in one of their little travel sets they
often have special offers on QVC or free
gifts with purchase that very often come
with minis of this because it is a
premium product it is slightly more
pricey than your average cleanser but I
think you'll agree that once you try it
you really will definitely want to
invest in the full-size version
something else from Elemis leads me on
to my next cold-weather Beauty essential
and it is an oil soap oils have so many
uses this dar fun one in particular is a
really good for multi-use oil I've
chosen the chamomile aromatic care so
first of all with the calomel fragrance
or balanced any of the fragrances from
the dark front oil ranges they're so
good for building a meet I'm a little
bit of a moment to take for yourself to
just rub it between your hands inhale
breathe take a moment for yourself great
if you want to do a little bit of
meditation or deep breathing or just
enjoy a pampering moment just for you
focusing on your breath I love the
darkness for that and I use some most
evenings they're also great for the face
I usually use around five drops after
inhaling I will press it onto my face
and my skin absolutely loves it
total rumor that if you have oily skin
you can't use an oil you absolutely can
it often stops the skin from creating
even more oil because it gets everything
that it needs from the skincare product
and then anything that's left I will
usually just rub into my cuticles to
also keep them nicely nourished as well
the pro-collagen marine oil from LMS is
another favorite this is slightly
lighter in consistency than the dark on
one so great if you want to layer up in
the evening so what I usually do is I'll
apply a serum after doing all my
cleansing then I'll apply this oil I'll
often leave this for about five minutes
on the skin and really let my skin
absorb the incredible ingredients in
this this contains a trio of seaweeds
hence the marine oil name which really
help the skin to look and feel
replenished and it also helps the skin
to look after its own more
your barrier which is very important
during the colder months and then also
over time this is also formulated to
help with fine lines and wrinkles so a
great anti-aging one as well I've lost
counts but we are almost at the end and
my next cold-weather Beauty essential is
a nourishing foundation so during the
winter months you want to ditch any
powdery or drying formulas and go for
something that's going to nourish the
skin something that you guys know that I
love i rave about it all the time is the
bare minerals Bair pro foundation so
this is fairly full coverage very
long-lasting and most importantly it is
so good to the skin so the formula has
minerals in there as you would expect
from bare minerals within the formula
you have got bamboo stem which helps to
give the skin a beautiful soft focus
effect I wear it all the time when I'm
filming because I think it gives the
most beautiful finish especially on
camera all important selfies are made
even better with this and then you've
got papaya in there which is really good
at minimizing the appearance of pores
again if you live somewhere polluted
that's a really great benefit it's SPF
20 no chemicals sweat resistant water
resistant not totally waterproof
genuinely there are just so many
benefits this foundation and it looks
great huge shade selection so highly
highly recommend bare minerals bare Pro
foundation if you haven't yet tried it
and my final Beauty essential for the
colder seasons is a hydrating serum this
is a really important factor within a
skincare routine to help prevent the
skin from drying out and keeping looking
it's radiant best and my current
favorite is the aqua serum the deep
hydration sorbet water essence from a
deal this is actually the first bit of
skincare that I've tried from deal and I
am very impressed so far it is from
their life collection which is kind of
the range aimed at Millennials slightly
more affordable price points this one I
believe is 49 pounds what I really love
about this as well as all the nourishing
ingredients which help to moisturize the
skin is it very very gently peels the
skin too so because of that the skin is
always regenerating always looking
really radiant and very very healthy
throughout the cold months
so those are my cold-weather beauty
essentials I really hope you enjoyed
