Year's Eve get ready with me video this
year I'm heading out from Roaring
Twenties murder-mystery evening at a
friend's house and I thought I'd
practice my makeup look in front of the
camera for you guys so you can see how I
put together this 1920s look it may not
be historically accurate but it's
definitely inspired by lots of different
makeup trends from the 20s which I'll
explain as I go along
so before I ramble for too long let's
get started so first I'm going to create
a really matte base using my new benefit
primer I don't want any glow for this
makeup look it definitely wasn't a trend
in the 1920s then I'm going to blend two
of my favorite foundations which are
from Rimmel and hourglass to create a
little bit more of a paler complexion
than I usually would and a really
flawless very full coverage finish and
I'm just blending the same with my zoeva
102 silk finish brush then I'm going in
with my NARS creamy concealer just to
attempt to hide those awful eye bags
that I seem to have developed over the
Christmas period and then I'm going to
blend this in with my fingers after
dotting it over my brow area and on the
chin as well then to set all the cream
makeup I'm using my bare minerals powder
just to make sure none of the cream
makeup goes walkabout during the evening
I also want to get rid of any shine that
might be left on my skin as I didn't do
any contouring in the 1920s I'm using
one of my paler bronzers which is the
estate Lord a bronze goddess just to
bring a little bit of shape into my face
but nothing too major and then for the
brows I'm using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow Wiz but I'm not adding any
volume to the brows because Finn brows
were more fashionable back in the 20s so
I'm just filling in any gaps in evening
out the shape
I'm setting the brows in place using my
benefit gimme brow but again not adding
too much volume then I'm using a bobbi
brown eyeshadow set to really start to
build up a bronzy brown smokey eye so
I'm using quite a pale shade all over
the lid and making sure it's really well
blended
then with a slightly darker shade I'm
going in over the crease I'm not being
too precise here I'm just going to keep
on building it until I get a look that I
like slowly adding in a little bit of
shimmer as well then I'm using an even
darker shade on the outer edges and
again just building it up to create a
brown smokey eye
as you can see I'm not being too precise
here I'm really just building it up
seeing how it looks as I go along
and then eventually I'm taking a
narrower and narrower brush and bringing
the shades underneath the eye as well
then I'm using the Urban Decay's Gwen
Stefani palette and a bit of a more
shimmery shade just to add a little bit
of sparkle while I blend the colors
together and then I'm using my by Terry
concealer just again to bring a little
bit more light to the under eye area
patting that in with my delicate ring
finger to make the eyes a little bit
darker I'm using a plum shade from the
Urban Decay palette just blending this
in making sure there are no harsh edges
so it's really thoroughly blended before
I use an urban decay not sure the name
of this one but I'll leave it below a
sparkly shadow just to bring a pop of
sparkle to the middle of the eyelid then
I'm just gonna use some liner although
they didn't really use liner in the
1920s but you know this doesn't have to
be completely historically accurate some
using the collection liner to use just
to create a liquid liner before applying
my lashes a lot of the makeup trends in
the 1920s were inspired by the Egyptians
I think if they were to use eyeliner
they probably would have done a bit of a
cat flick and then as you can see I'm
just using a normal mascara before
cheaply adding a little bit of contour
just as I thought my face needed a
little bit more shaping this again
definitely not historically accurate for
1920s
then I'm trimming some of my Vegas nay
eyelashes they fit perfectly and
applying those using the eyelash glue
next I'm gonna shaping my lips so I've
taken my most high coverage concealer
which is by Vichy dermablend and just
narrowing in the edges of my lips to
create more of a pout shape which was
really fashionable in the 20s and then
I'm using the shade West from Tom Ford
lips and boys and it's kind of like a
deep plum shade which was really trendy
back in the 20s because it's a dark
color I'm using a lip liner brush this
one's from a Delilah just to create a
very precise shape and then going in
with the lipstick
then I'm using one of the Estee Lauder
lip potions I wanted more of an ombre
kind of red plum look so I've used the
dopher applicator just add a different
shade in there and then one area of
makeup where they really did love a bit
of color was the blush so I'm using my
charlotte tilbury cheek to cheek in the
sex on fire to add a pop of blush to my
face then I decided I need a little bit
more darkness on the eyes so I took a
really narrow brush back to my Bobbi
Brown palette and added some liner
before using my brand new charlotte
tilbury bar of gold highlighter to add a
very very subtle highlight to the tops
of the cheekbones that's the final
makeup stage then I pull my hair down
out of the ponytail give it a good shake
before turning on my new GHD curved wand
hair colors I'm not actually going to
have my hair down this is more just to
bring some curls in so that my bun can
be nice and voluminous long hair wasn't
really very fashionable they normally
would have tied it up or pinned it all
up so I'm just adding some volume with a
Kara Stars volume in powder before
adding in my pearl headband and curling
my hair into a side fun I wasn't having
a very good hair day and probably could
have made a little bit more effort here
but you know this was quite a cool
hairstyle in the 1920s then I used some
pins which match my hair color just to
secure the bun in place loosen it up a
little bit and add a little bit more of
the Kara Stars hairspray to hold it in
place finally I'm adding in a little
clip just to add a bit more pretty
detail into the hairstyle
and here we are this is the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys have
