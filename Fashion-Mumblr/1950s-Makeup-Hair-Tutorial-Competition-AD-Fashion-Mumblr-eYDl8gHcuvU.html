glamorous makeup look tutorial for hair
and makeup so I'm doing this look to
celebrate the release of the film
Brooklyn which is out on blu-ray and DVD
on February the 29th courtesy of lions
gate home entertainment so the film is
about the beautiful Irish girl whose
name is Eilish hard to say without doing
it in an Irish accent who is from a
small town in Ireland and travels to
America to pursue the American dream to
basically get a job where she falls in
love with a lovely gentleman I'm not
going to give you too much information
because you just need to see the film
yourself it's such a lovely film but
basically throughout the film she starts
with a beautiful very natural makeup
look and then as the film progresses
when she moves to America she gets more
and more glamorous with the help of some
of her friends along the way so I had
the pleasure of meeting Mona and
Lorraine who are the hair and the UT
artists behind the film they worked with
the actress Sasha who takes lead role in
the film and they created all of her
1950s makeup looks so I actually
recorded my little chat with them so
throughout this tutorial we inserting a
few little links and clips around here
of my chat with them and they're going
to be giving some really interesting
snippets of historically accurate
information on how the look would have
been created in the 1950s when the film
is set so this look is more of a
glamorous retro pinup 1950s look whereas
in the film it's a little bit more
stripped back and natural but I thought
that this would be the kind of look that
you guys would like to see the most and
would probably be more likely to want to
recreate yourselves at home if you do
recreate this look at home then I am so
excited to tell you that I have paired
up with Lionsgate to give you a
passionately retro bike to one lucky
winner so if you do decide to recreate
this look then take a photo or a video
and tag me on your instagram with
hashtag for a clean look or load it to
lionsgate facebook page and you could
win at this gorgeous bike so without
further adieu
let's get started with the hair for this
1950s glamorous makeup look so the
hairstyle that I'm going for is a really
big voluminous wavy hairstyle which is a
kind of thing that you would have seen
on Marilyn Monroe Audrey Hepburn
Elizabeth Taylor those kind of really
glamorous
icons of the 1950s era in the film
Brooklyn the hairstyles are a little bit
more stretch back but for stammers look
I thought I'd give you the tutorial for
big curls so I'm going to be using the
GHD curve which is a new Tama to my
collection and I'm loving it so far for
creating really big and glamorous curls
so before I switch that on I'm going to
separate out a really deep side parting
just to create a bit of volume and they
are big friends to the side parting back
in the 1950s so once that's done I'm
going to taking a section of hat just
writing it with some hairspray they
probably would have used something like
L net back in those days or even a hair
lacquer like the L'Oreal BRE I think it
was called so missing the section before
using the tongs to create a really big
lovely girl
I'm gonna collect the curl before it
cools down and pin it onto my head just
using some bobby pins now back in the
50s they probably wouldn't have used
something like this
I definitely wouldn't they probably
would have used heated rollers maybe
even heated in the oven all they would
have used to upset cool when they kind
of tied hair I'm like string I know
Rachel the official term I'm sure the
girls will let us know the fifties is
the curls you know quite defined quite
pronounced waves in Reynolds so in order
to achieve that they've been used at the
strongest emotion doctor the women in
especially for Cora they'd go to bed
with their pin curls in mmm-hmm or and
rags rags I didn't wash the
it's watching condition now because as
you can see I wasn't terribly good at
this particular technique I decided to
just do the normal curling technique
before at the back of my hair so she's
on the tongs the way they're intended to
be used and letting the curls drop
naturally now when I have all the curls
in place I'm going to use one more fine
mist of hairspray leave them to cool
down before slowly and carefully taking
them out and using a very bristly brush
just to brush through the style
next let's have a look at how I create
this makeup look so before I start my
makeup I'm going to pin back my
beautiful curls because I do not want to
get any makeup in them and I'm just
using some plain hairdressers clips
which won't add any kinks into the curls
looking a little bit like Heidi from
Switzerland and I'm just going to put on
some lip balm and I'm using the Clarins
instant light because I'm going to go
for really bold red lip which can it dry
out the lips so just starting with some
lip balm now as always I'm going to
start with the base and a really full
base was incredibly popular in the 1950s
there are loads of different formulas
available ranging from liquids to creams
to almost like a cake block or
foundation to get that really lovely
heavy base I'm going to be using the
Immaculate finish foundation from power
glass this gives a really thick coverage
I say a drugstore
Chifa alternative would be the Rimmel
match perfection and I'm going to dock
this on to my skin which I've just put
some moisturizer and some mattifying
primer on there so far because a really
matte complexion was the rage in the
1950s and I'm using a buffing brush from
zoeva just to blend this in and because
a really full makeup look was the style
I might even go in with a second coat
but for a 50s look it's not you know
today's shiny look doesn't really work
so it's really a powder very much file
yes
coat number two just to give it even
more of that heavy finish that they
loved in the 50s now concealer was one
thing that wasn't that readily available
so whereas normally I would put some
under eye concealer on and maybe on any
areas of redness it just wasn't that
available to buy the 50s so I'm going to
miss that step out and instead just to
go for a bit of higher coverage with my
foundation next we're going to do the
eye shadow and I'm taking a zoeva soft
crease liner bristle brush just to add a
metallic brown shade all over the lid
now in the 1950s they used to love
possible shades for also neutral grounds
and I feel like Browns
is definitely something you can get away
with in 2016 a little bit more than
pastels but they only really used to use
one color they never used to blend the
colors too much so I'm just using this
one color and swiping it all over the
eyelid and bringing it out into the soft
almond shape just to create a really
elongated shape and then I'm really
blending it in so that I don't have any
harsh lines you're not going to take it
too dark just one simple wash of color
and then I'm taking a clean of Bobby
Brown blending brush just to really make
sure there's no harsh lines
we didn't they didn't have the selection
of eyeshadows that we have nowadays now
in the 50s they like their brows really
strong and dark but still very
natural-looking especially towards the
beginning of the 50s now the film
Brooklyn was set in 1952 which overseas
at the beginning of the 50s so they
would have kept their brows big but
still very natural-looking they would
have taken inspiration from the girls
like Elizabeth Taylor
Marlon Monroe and definitely Audrey
Hepburn with her lovely big brows so to
get that really big but still natural
look I'm going to use my trusty Urban
Decay brow beta and I'm going to really
follow the natural shape of my own brows
but accentuating that arch area
now when it comes to liner I really
winged out black.look was all the rage
going back to that retro pin-up look so
I'm going to use a bobby brown gel liner
and my Sigma angled brush to create that
really defined flick in eyeliner you
know keeping it very close to the
eyelashes and not do you think lamenting
on the carrot and that's what I did for
Sara show was you know just a very fine
line I mean some and some people use
pencil and they sort of give it a flick
and side okay and because I really bold
upper lash line was all the rage in the
1950s I'm also going to take a pencil
this is my Tom Ford eye defining pencil
I'm going to use this to tight line just
to create a real black defined upper
lash line pencil you know these
next I'm going to apply some mascara and
while the main character in the Brooklyn
Film Irish doesn't really go too wild on
her mascara she definitely favors a more
natural look I'm going to do another
trend from the 1950s which was that
really old glamorous retro pinup very
intense black mascara look so I'm going
to be using the new Estee Lauder
centrist knockout to really build the
volume on my upper lash line now they
didn't used to use much mascara on the
lower lash line because they really
wanted to create that wide open eyed
look they doesn't have the wand the scar
is then they used to have these little
Zuck you know the cake mascara with a
little M like a very small tooth brush
with the single line of Harris and they
you used to wet that with water and then
so this mascara is really good for
creating a lovely fan effect and lifting
up the lashes which means I don't have
to use eyelash curlers which they
probably wouldn't have had in 1952 and
the film is set the big brands back then
would have been brands like Revlon Max
Factor bourgeois they probably would
have been the brands that would have
been used back then maybe I still order
I'm not too sure if it was around back
in the 1950s but tube mascara with the
formula that we used to seen today was
probably starting to come about in 1952
but became more popular towards the end
of the 50s whereas when the film is set
especially in Brooklyn in 1952 they
probably would have used Palatka mascara
still which is kind of like a bar of
soap and then almost like a toothbrush
to really put the mascara onto the
lashes kind of like painting the lashes
so nothing like what we use today so
I've taken you back again so that we can
go back to working on the base
as I mentioned a ring that space was all
the rage in the 1950s they would have
used something like a translucent powder
of which they preferred either a clear
powder or something that was a little
bit peachy or even green to even out
those red undertones so to recreate the
look I'm using a bare minerals
translucent powder and which is a
blemish remedy and I'm taking it on a
creative max of how to brush so I'm just
going to really loosely dab that all
over the face to get rid of any glow
that is remaining from my foundation
using bronzer and contouring really
wasn't a big trend in the 1950s but in
the film Brooklyn the actress Saoirse
who plays Eilish she has the most
incredible cheekbones so I'm going to
use that as an excuse to replicate that
look and just use a little bit of
bronzer this is my blusher use a little
bit of bronzer to recreate that slightly
chiseled but very natural-looking
cheekbone I'm just really light you're
going to bring that in to my jaw line
just above the jaw line under the
cheekbone to really bring a little bit
of shape into the face but without
making it too obvious we definitely
don't want to look like we've got too
much makeup in this area I think this is
something that you can bring up over
your forehead just to give the face a
nice bit of shape so I'm using my gallon
bronzer which doesn't have any shimmer
in it's a really nice natural one and
I'm using a sigma face shape brush just
bring it in to the jaw line area
blush I would have been used really
sparingly in the 1950s just to add a bit
of warmth to the face so I'm going to
use a Sigma brush and my Charlotte
Tilbury blusher just to do the same just
to add a little bit of warmth to the
cheeks and also they could have taken it
up onto the forehead temples all of the
aim of just bringing a little bit of
warmth into your complexion so I've used
the Sigma duo fiber brush here and
because it's to your fiber I find that
it really doesn't pick up too much
product so it's great if you want to
create that really barely there
sparing blush look which is perfect for
the 1950s think that's not gonna leave
at that and then the most exciting part
is the lips for me the best makeup
moment in the film is where all the
girls including Eilish are at an Irish
dance in Brooklyn and her sisters or
kind of sisters from the boardinghouse
give her a makeover and then she banks
the man that she's been eyeing up so
it's a really lovely scene and when she
has that lipstick on you can really see
that the girl's confidence just
immediately as boosted so I'm going to
be using a few products to create a
really lovely bold red lip which was all
the trend in the 1950s Reds pinks and
corals are also popular but red was
definitely the defining color I'm going
to start by using the Clarins instant
light lip perfecting base just to make
sure I have that really perfect base to
start off my red lip so just applying
this all over kind of like a balm but
really creates a mattifying base for the
lips and in the 1950s big bold lips was
all the rage so they would have taken a
liner like this one which is the
Charlotte Tilbury red carpet liner and
just gone outside the natural shape of
the lips to really make them look bigger
there's quite a range of lipsticks but
Red's to corals okay which always kind
of fashion exactly yeah yeah nobody used
to go slightly over the lip nine and
draw it in a car just do another time
yes more emphatic than searches her
Hearst was quite you know perfect and
I'm going to fill in my lips using
Charlotte tillery's red carpet red which
is a really classic red color and would
have been incredibly popular back in the
50s and because I wanted to really
precise them using a Delilah lip liner
brush
and so that's the makeup done the only
last thing to do is take out the hair
clip give the hair as usual and we're
done so this is it the finished beauty
look for that 1950s glamorous pinup
style I really hope you guys have
