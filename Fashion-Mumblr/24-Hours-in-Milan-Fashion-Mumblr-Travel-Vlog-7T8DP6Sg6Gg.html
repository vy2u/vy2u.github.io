this vlog is starting in a slightly less
exotic location than my last one hurt
you guys enjoyed my Croatia vlog I
really enjoyed editing now and actually
it's a really really nice way to relive
the trip so hopefully you enjoyed my
Croatia vlog and China I got back from
Croatia about two days ago maybe
yesterday when I'm losing track of time
and today we're going it to Milan and
we're only going for just over 24 hours
so it's a real whirlwind trip and we are
going as guests of Samsung and so
something I've got I think it's a new
phone coming out um or it's already out
really don't know too much about it to
be honest but we're going to find all of
that out later tonight and tomorrow
so yeah just a 24-hour trip but I've
never been to Milan before I'm really
excited for some Italian food and just
to see another city so it's going to be
really good fun and I asked you guys on
twitch if you wanted a vlog or a
snapchat own story and you said a vlog
so that's what we're doing and I'm just
finishing packing right now I was
debating whether to take a suitcase
because Samsung have ordered us a
suitcase with our luggage and I could
probably fit everything into a backpack
or don't if you saw my blogger Mel
unboxing on snapchat the other day but
um I was recently said this Herschel
backpack which I absolutely love and
it's ginormous I probably could get
everything in there but probably to make
my life a bit easier with liquids and
all that think I'm gonna take a suitcase
so I'm going to show you what I am
packing so I've laid most things out on
the bed not going crazy and I've got
this little bag here it just got like
face wipes what else
that bitch's face wipes these shoes I
thought would be nice for walking around
the town this evening got my pajamas and
these are I think yeah Toni &amp;amp; Guy hair
straighteners they're probably my
smallest strainers my book the secret I
need to finish it I'm just taking one
bikini I don't think we're going to have
time to swim or anything bum taking it
just in case and then the workshop
tomorrow is Fitness related so I've got
some sweaty Betty leggings and a top
there toiletries makeup this is my Club
Monaco dress that I bought in America
recently and what's that that's a little
bag to put it in so it doesn't touch any
shoes or anything so I might wear that
tomorrow afternoon
Valentino Hamburg got my Miss Selfridge
little dress which I wore all the time
in South Africa think I'll wear that one
tonight got my memory cards and here I
keep all my memory cards in this little
jewelry pouch is Monica Veneto jewelry
pouch but it's really good for storing
my memory cards for my camera so I keep
all of them in there and then underneath
it this is kind of being my electronics
bag ever since track America I've just
kept all my charges and stuff in there
sunglasses hairbrush portable phone
charger not going to take that camera
and then some baby wipes and I'll be
taking my laptop my hard drive with me
as so I think to save my poor back or
probably Charlie's and I will pack all
my bits into a suitcase so yeah
let's skip go through that was easy I've
packed all of those pieces and I have
half a suitcase left that's empty and I
think actually they're going to be
giving us the phone and the new Samsung
phone on the SmartWatch so I've got a
bit of room to keep the boxes and all of
that so I'm not going to fill it up just
for the sake of it and then I'm going to
take my rucksack with my Valentino
humbug in it as my hand luggage because
I don't want to be parted from it just
imagine if that got lost
so yeah going to take my laptop and my
bag in my rucksack and yeah our taxis
coming in just under an hour's so I'm
going to try and write up a blog post
that's really optimistic in under an
hour so that I can schedule it so I
don't have to worry about writing one
tomorrow morning and yes I'll see you in
the taxi
so we have just checked into our hotel
room with today at the NH hotel in Milan
and we've just met Alicia downstairs
she's showing us the gear fit watches I
think they're called and I'm going to
choose between blue and pink so
obviously I've gone for pink one and
Charlie secretly wants black for the
daytime I do rules but yeah so this is
our hotel room we've got bed we've got a
little desk area we got a bathroom um
and we're all meeting downstairs in 15
minutes to dinner so I'm going to have a
super speedy hair and makeup session
fifteen minutes later and I feel like
you can be a different person share
problems so yeah we're downstairs in
reception now we're just waiting for any
just calm down
it has yalcón dinner some here with
Charlie and two journalists
so there's Erica who writes for women's
health and Lucy
because the watch has been launched
so it's more fitness focused
so we've just been given a goody bag
full of bits and pieces from Samsung
including this which is when you watch I
literally only spit on all I've managed
to do is figure out how to change the
watch face but even that is looking very
cool so you know no playing on you
pieces and I'm sure
we've just got to the restaurant I'm
glowing because you just walked up and
hours getting here my watch tells me
that we're walking in a healthy pace I
thought I quickly have a look inside
can't really contain my excitement any
longer my dear darling
so back what happened here I'm still
working on is about to finish it's going
to tell me not to eat too much I think
this is the Fox oh yes to the watch well
done hundred twenty-seven
that's your starter that's probably
myself okay
good morning I don't know why I'm
looking so shiny on the camera I promise
you I have put powder on today so we've
just woken up and got changed and gone
down for breakfast Charlie just met a
famous record player definitely a
special early
who is that Bolton Castro regime Martin
Castro Giovanni who apparently said once
that he couldn't play see was ill and
then got photographed out partying in
Vegas so bit of a naughty one and yeah
he was massive I'll insert a photo
Charlie with him here in case you have
any idea who that is but he was massive
and so yeah we just had breakfast here
in the hotel we're meant to be wearing
our gym clothes now because we're doing
some stuff with the Samsung gear watch
but I'm obviously not to hang my gym
stuff because I really wanted some
photos because it's so pretty every
building outside our hotel is just
absolute gorgeous so we're going to go
and slip some quick photos and then
we're heading it to disaster
so now we've taken the obligatory outfit
photos but on the move again this time
when walking meeting with the Samsung
offices I only know two minute walk away
that a tunable guests data analysis
but as you can see I've got changed into
my gym gear because you're going to be
doing some exercises using the new
Samsung gear band and yeah I'm excited
too it's really exciting payment you
take my ID I feel like a little child at
Christmas time with Chi Minh or go see
more in Milan but at least we're working
in our game taxi so you can see a little
bit and hopefully we'll finish early
today so really once goes the iconic
major I was using the location of my
Instagram to look at some crucial places
nearby and that's not far away from a
stone flow fingers post we'll have a
little bit of time exterminator
so we just did a what
my god
stressing out
and Charlie's party very impressed
Freeman will show you that we're the
best routes from
this pitchbook
my co-star
this is
so I'm in the kitchen
there's a lounge section behind me with
my biggest TV eyes
Mira
Wow
I'm so cool okay so we did a little bit
of meditation using these wireless
earphones which were very snazzy
definitely gone to the top of Charlie's
wishlist haven't they they are
incredible annoyingly I didn't start to
hear it until about 15 minutes in so I
did miss three quarters of meditation
that nevermind I have to do it again in
my own time but now we're on to playing
with our next gadget which is the sheer
360 choice I'm a really good time so
basically this camera is actually two
cameras back-to-back which have 190
degree and so we'll have it narrowed
range under 90 so they overlap slightly
which means on my phone I can see all
around what Charlie is seeing so let's
have no honey
expose your baby I'm just trying to see
your baby is not a baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
