film in 2017 and the first video that
you guys are seeing on my channel in
2017 so welcome back I hope you had a
fabulous Christmas and New Year all

a subscribe button just here if you
would like to do that talking of
subscribing thank you guys so much for I
think we're over 83,000 subscribers now
almost 84 so thank you from the bottom
of my heart to everybody that has
subscribed already if you can hear a
little pattering in the background by
the way that's Dexter he's decided that
now would be a good time to play with
his new crocodile for the new year I
haven't made any new year's resolutions
as such but instead I just wanted to
focus this year a lot more on
mindfulness and wellness so I'm kicking
that off with today's video so I have a
bit of a hoarder mentality but I
recognize that all the clutter and mess
that this causes leaves me a little bit
stressed and overwhelmed so this year I
want it to be less about things and more
about people and experiences but having
said that confession time I am a
materialistic person I love buying new
handbags new shoes and you makeup
products if you guys have watched my
channel in the past you'll already know
that so I'm not promising whole new year
new me but instead this year is more
about finding that balance and I hope
you guys will enjoy coming on journey
with me so I really wanted to share that
journey with you guys here on my youtube
channel and this is definitely not going
to be a guide on how to live a perfect
well-rounded mindful lifestyle because
let's face it that's not what I have and
this is very much a journey for me and
it's a journey that I wanted to bring
you guys along on I am only just making
my very first steps along this journey
so whether you want to take few small
steps with me and take a little bit some
inspiration from these videos or come
along this whole journey with me
and I hope you guys enjoy this new
series on my youtube channel so this
year there is going to be more of a
focus on wellness and mindfulness
perhaps I'll make it a miniseries like
midweek mindfulness or wellness
wednesdays or something if you've got
any better ideas and please let me know
in the comment section below but I
really do want to make this type of
video a lot more regular on this channel
there's also going to be more along this
kind of subjects over on my blog so if
you haven't checked out my blog yet
fashion mumbler com I'll leave a link
down below and I would love if you check
that out too I know that a lot of you
watching this might be a lot further on
your journey than I am so if you have
any recommendations of other YouTube
channels that you love watching along
this similar lines or any vlogs you like
to read podcasts then please leave any
of your recommendations down in the
comment section below
not just for myself but for anybody else
watching and yeah share the love I'd
love to find out who your favorite
youtubers are on more of a mindful
wellness kind of focus so today's video
is going to be 25 things that you don't
need in 2017 as they say tidy house tidy
mind so I don't know about you but I've
been doing a lot of decluttering in this
first week of the year and they say that
organization has such a positive impact
on the mind and well-being so I thought
it'd be a really good place to start so
here are my 25 things you don't need in
2017 number one how to date beauty
products makeup does have an expiry date
things like mascara lip glosses
lipsticks they expire a lot quicker than
things like powders so I'll leave a
little bit of guidance down below as to
how long you should hold onto your
beauty products number two travel sizes
especially when it comes to monthly
beauty boxes and beauty event calendars
were all guilty of stashing those travel
size products and then never using them
hotel minis are plain minis just get rid
of them number three products that don't
work for you if you've spent a lot of
money on a cleanser but it's not right
for you then pass it on to someone who
it will work for there's no use in
holding on to it because it's unlikely
that your skin is going to change number
4 makeup brushes that you don't use I
bet like me use the same makeup brushes
day in day out
if you've got spare ones just get rid of
them number five declutter your handbag
Marie Kondo says that she empties out
her handbag every day and while this is
a little bit excessive
I suggest rummaging through your handbag
pulling out all those old receipts I'm
just clearing out all the stuff in there
you don't need to be coming around with
you every single day
number six declutter your purse get rid
of all of those loyalty cards you never
use outer day receipts gift vouchers
just get rid number seven freebie
clothing if you've ever gone to an event
and got a free t-shirt that you're
currently wearing is your pajama top get
rid of it number eight same goes to any
clothing with holes in it or bubbles in
it you don't need that in your life
check it out
number nine same goes for anything you
haven't worn in six months or more if
it's not in season then put it in the
loft or store it somewhere but if you
haven't worn it in quite a long time
then you don't need it number ten
odd socks eleven old underwear and bras
that you just don't wear anymore
number twelve old uniforms or prom
dresses anything that used to wear to
work I found a pair of smart black
trousers in my wardrobe the other day
despite not having worked in an office
for nearly two years now they are now
long gone number thirteen shoes that
hurt your feet because there's just no
point in keeping hold of them if you're
never going to wear them no matter how
beautiful they are next category is tech
and number 14 is to declutter your inbox
I spent my New Year's Day unsubscribing
from all of those newsletters that I
really couldn't care less about whether
that was mail Fitness things that
somehow I managed to get signed up to or
clothing brands that you no longer wear
bloggers newsletters that you'll no
longer interested in just unsubscribe a
clear inbox is a clear mind number
fifteen declutter your facebook if there
are people on your friends list you've
only met once all that you no longer
talk to sounds harsh but just dear
friend number sixteen declutter your
Instagram and Twitter are there people
that you follow that are no longer
relevant to your life bloggers that no
longer inspire you or people that you're
just not friends with anymore unfollow
unfriend forget
number 17 is apps on your phone did you
download a loyalty at once or do you
have apps for companies you'll no longer
working with just get rid of them number
18 your desktop and your documents
folders on your laptop or computer I
like to do this when I don't have Wi-Fi
on airplanes just get rid of old
documents put things in the right
folders and have a clear desktop number
19 cables and manuals if you don't know
what the cables for get rid of it
manuals you can find the instructions
all online so you just don't need them
and finally home starting off at number
19 dried out pens I bet you've got pops
of pens all over the house half of which
don't work so just spend a few minutes
grab a notebook and any pens that don't
work just check them out think now's
number 20 actually 21 cookbooks that you
don't use you might have been given them
as gift you may not use those recipes
anymore you may not have ever used them
any cookbooks just take them to a
charity shop 20 to old bed linen if
you're anything like me you probably use
the same set or two sets or three sets
on repeat if you've got extras you don't
need them 23 old yummy books textbooks
anything to do with your school or uni
or notes you just no longer use you can
sell them online or just take them to a
charity shop number 24 gifts that you
don't really want the person that gave
them to you will never find out so don't
let them clutter up your house and
number 25 old magazines yes it might be
nice to have a big pile of Oaks under
your coffee table but I ever really
going to read them probably not so
instead why not just recycle so those
are my 25 things you don't need in 2017
I hope this inspired you to have a
little bit of a tidy out a little bit of
a deep butter and that's definitely
something that I find just helps to
clear my mind and help me be a little
bit more less stressed in the home so it
was anything that you have been
decluttering then let me know in the
comments section below

that you don't need in 2017 once again
