joining me for today's video we're going
to be talking about autumn boots today
autumn boots the kind of thing that we
just reach for on a daily basis at this
time of year so I'm going to be showing
the top five styles that I personally
feel that every girl should have in her
wardrobe as always everything that I
mentioned in today's video will be
linked down in the description box
ranging from the boot styles that I
share with you and also what I'm wearing
so for any kind of information as well
as blog posts on how to style the boots
just click show more and you'll find
everything you need in the description
box if you're new to my channel then
firstly welcome here you'll find loads
of fashion videos ranging on how to
style certain things like how to style
over knee boots as a recent video holes
look books all that kind of jazz so
please hit the subscribe button to make
sure you don't miss on any of my future
videos I'm gonna get straight started
with my first boot style and it is
pointed ankle boots so I have got a
couple of pairs to show you for each
style I'm going to show you a few of the
ones that I own and give you a few
styling tips too so first of all pointed
toe ankle boots I have got this
beautiful burgundy pair from Reese I've
had these for about six weeks now they
are a fabulous investment they are so
comfortable despite the fact that they
have a stiletto heel but actually I find
that when it comes to pointed toe boots
they're very chic they're very leg
elongating and they've definitely got
that kind of edgy vibe to them so I
think the stiletto heel works really
well with pointed toe boots the point
does give the illusion of longer legs as
well as I find them very flattering and
I've opted for this pair in a very
neutral burgundy color and also a black
pair from Topshop these are a little bit
more affordable actually still have the
label on the bottom and these were 59
pounds whereas I think the Reese ones
were probably about a hundred pound more
expensive than that I went for the
Topshop ones in black and I've worn
these loads with like faux leather
leggings and with black tights as well
very very versatile I would recommend
going for pointed toe boots that are
cropped just above the ankle it just
makes them very very versatile and
you'll be surprised with how many things
look great with pointed toe boots
personally I love styling with jompa
dresses I feel like everything goes with
jumper dresses but also a simple jeans
and t-shirt outfit can be elevated with
the style that you get from pointed toe
boots and also amid
skirts my respec you watched my Boston
outfit diaries and other recent videos
you'll know that I've been pairing this
pair with also a burgundy-colored
pleated midi skirt and that's become one
of my go-to outfits these ones also have
a slightly different texture at the top
and the bottom the top is suede the
bottom is leather and it's these kind of
design details that you do get when you
go to the premium end of the market so I
would recommend investing in a pair of
pointed toe stiletto boots to start with
the next one is probably the most
obvious and it is a pair of black ankle
boots I have a few in my collection and
I do find that I get a lot of use out of
these especially given that I don't wear
a lot of black so for people that do
wear a lot of black then I can imagine
that you pretty much just don't take
these off I've got a beautiful pair from
Kurt Geiger I think they were just over
100 pounds but I feel that the design
details on these make them look a whole
lot more expensive than that
I love the buckle I love the faux croc
it makes them very versatile and then I
really like this different color detail
on the heel too when it comes to ankle
boots I would recommend going for a
neutral color whether that's black or
tan or even burgundy I think burgundy
definitely qualifies as a neutral now
that we're in autumn and also a low
chunky block heel because you're
probably going to wear them on a day to
day basis you want something that's very
comfortable very easy to walk in and a
chunky low heel just a couple of inches
is exactly that if you do want a bit of
a height boost so you want to heel
that's slightly higher maybe look for
one that's got a little bit more of a
platform in the ball of the foot because
that raises the entire foot meaning that
it cancels out a little bit of the heel
height making them a whole lot more
comfortable again because you're going
to get so much wear out of them I do
recommend going for that slightly higher
price point than the more budget ones
look for natural materials that are
going to let the foot breathe like good
quality leather and also look for
something with a slightly spongy sole
because you don't want too much pressure
on the ball of your foot for walking
around for miles and miles all day every
day so I have this pair from Kurt Geiger
which I absolutely adore and have a
couple more pass through to this pair I
got from Reese last year I love wearing
tan leather ankle boots with white jeans
I think they look absolutely beautiful
it's a very timeless style again that
these are really beautiful quality with
Ricci do you get that gorgeous
craftsmanship this is my second pair of
shoes I've shown you and again that they
have a slightly higher heel than the
Kurt Geiger ones but because it's such a
chunky heel I don't really notice the
heel height I find them still very
comfortable for wearing all day long and
from
this is definitely a neutral shade which
I find works with so many outfit
combinations I mentioned burgundy as a
neutral so these are my third pair of
ankle boots that I've invested in this
season again these ones are from Kurt
Geiger beautiful soft spongy leather
beautiful chunky block heel and these
I've been wearing with black jeans black
leather leggings burgundy leather
leggings midi skirts again so so
versatile so definitely pick up at least
a one pair of neutral could ankle boots
this autumn winter ok so the next boot
style that I feel every girl should have
in her wardrobe is a practical boot now
if you live in the countryside you
probably will already have an entire
wardrobe or boot room perhaps full of
practical boots but now I live in the
city I find that I don't have quite so
many and the ones that I do have I want
them to also be very stylish so the pair
that I have to show you is this gorgeous
gorgeous pair from Ruslan Bromley these
are new to my collection I haven't even
worn them yet so very excited to show
them to you but as you can see they are
very practical they go up nice and high
they've got a shilling inside so they're
going to be very snuggly warm I'll
probably wear them with thick chunky
socks to that added snuggle factor and
then they've got a very practical grippy
sole if it gets icy snowy I can go for
these ones if I'm walking the dogs I can
wear them but also because they are so
beautiful I can also style them up for
days out in town days in central London
for meetings they have everything they
have style and they have practicality so
really beautiful boot I did a blog post
recently in collaboration with Tom's
Tom's of course have those almost like
Timberland style boots very practical
very versatile and gained a style of
boot the afonya soft wearing so much so
my third boot style that every girl must
have in her wardrobe is a practical beat
number 4 unsurprisingly is the over knee
boot I've been wearing over knee boots
pretty much every single day for the
past month or so and I'm totally smitten
with the style in fact I have an entire
video about my top 5 over knee boots how
to style them and how to care for them
so I'll leave that linked up on the
screen now and also down in description
box so definitely go and watch that one
next I was reading the comments this
morning it actually went live today the
day that I'm filming this and a few of
you have been saying that you love them
but you didn't know how to style them
but you found the video really useful so
definitely check them out you'll be
surprised with how many outfits look
amazing
they look even better with over knee
boots and I'm just totally smitten with
the style this is probably my favorite
pair they are from Karen Millen
and I had the same pair but in a rusty
brown color last year at Walden all the
time so I didn't think twice about
investing in this grey pair this year
they're beautifully made they've got a
concealed zip the suede quality is
absolutely beautiful I protected them
right away with suede spray I talked
about all that in the other video so
don't even check that out and once again
we've got that low chunky heel which
makes them so comfortable
and so easy to walk in for a full day I
have also an even more affordable pair
of gray over knee boots these ones are
faux suede they are from River Island
and I think these are probably the best
pair in the more affordable section of
the high streets I find gray over knee
boots so versatile once again they work
with so many different outfits but also
black beige and rusty colors I think are
so so stunning this one I think these
are 75 pounds are quite tight so make
sure you definitely try them on my tip
would be to roll them all the way down
before pulling them up instead of trying
to put your leg in when they're all the
way we rolled out because that is pretty
much impossible slightly higher heel
than the Karen Millen ones pointed toes
you get that elongated leg effect but
there's just something about over knee
boots that make an outfit look so
stylish so if you haven't yet I would
definitely recommend going out buying a
pair of over knee boots let me know
which style you go for because you guys
will be so smitten with how amazing they
make your autumn wardrobe look the final
boot style that every girl should have
in her wardrobe is the boho boot don't
worry I'm not going to tell you that you
have to go and buy the clothes Suzanna
boots I'm just using these as my first
example these are the ICONic cozy
Susanna in a beige suede with the gold
studs I decided to invest in these after
thinking about them for so long
I um Dan aren't over black or beige but
I'm so glad I went for this color
combination it works so well with my
wardrobe this style of boot again very
versatile can be dressed up or down with
smoked dresses with jeans with denim
shorts all throughout the year I find
myself reaching for these I've worn them
tons and yet they don't
any signs of were very very good quality
but of course very expensive so I was
very pleasantly surprised when I saw
this pair on Topshop as I mentioned I
was aiming an iron between the black or
the tan ended up going for the beige
versions of the Cloe Susannah but I did
still think a lot about the black pair
so when I saw these dupes in Topshop had
to go for them so please of those
haven't actually worn them yet they are
45 pounds but I'm looking forward to
wearing them this weekend they're
probably the best high-street Joop that
I've seen of the chloe Susannah boots
and because they're Topshop they're just
really well-made I know Primark have
some - I did buy a pair ended up taking
them back they just didn't feel right
they didn't fit well that's Topshop you
can just trust them to have really well
designed and very good price shoes so
these are a dupe for the Cloe Susanna's
but another style of boho boot is this
doll slightly more punky slightly more
like a biker boot I have this pair from
a brand called Diceman which is a German
brand and these were $34.99 so if you
guys know my style you might know that
I'm not very cool I'm not very by curry
or edgy so I thought that because I
really wanted to experiment with this
style I'd go for some that were very
affordable so if it didn't end up
getting loads of use out of them
wouldn't be the end of the world but a
nice affordable way for me to try out
the style that's usually my tactic when
it comes to things and I'm not too sure
about going with the dupes or the
affordable versions and then see how
much use you get out of them these are
from the Ellie Goulding collaboration I
actually think they look a lot more
high-end and a lot more expensive than
their price tag but a really cool bike a
boot design quite chunky low heel so
great for wearing all day and loads of
these silver buckles which gives them a
really cool edgy look once again I'll be
wearing these with jeans are we wearing
these with leather leggings and
hopefully these will add some
much-needed cool strobe points to my
wardrobe so there's my top 5 boot stars
I feel every girl should have in her
wardrobe I really hope you guys found
this video useful and interesting please
leave me a comment in the comment
section down below about your favourite
boot style or maybe there's a style that
you guys have been screaming at the
screen the whole time that I've not
mentioned please do let me know if there
is a boot style that you think every
girl should have in her wardrobe but
that's all from me thank you guys so
much for watching as always and I look
forward to seeing you in my next video
