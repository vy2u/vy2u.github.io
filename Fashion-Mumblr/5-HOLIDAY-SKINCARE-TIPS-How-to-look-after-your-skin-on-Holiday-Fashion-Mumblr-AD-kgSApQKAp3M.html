five simple tips for looking after your
skin while on holiday at the heart of
this is water whether at home for when
traveling heat cold stress temperature
changes pollution and humidity all
affect our skin
in fact our skin can be exposed of just
seventeen thermic shocks
in a single day which can lead to
dehydration and a dull complexion when
traveling east on o'clock include the
dry air on our plane a cooling sensation
of a fan will be even cooler and harsher
air conditioning the skin is exposed to
heat working out in the gym from warm up
to cool down
of course stairs humidity sun exposure
and chlorinated and seawater is intended
to so these simple tips will help the
skin regain its capacity to retain water
while you travel but they can also be
used at home too so it all come as no
surprise that my first tip is hydration
I try to drink half a glass also every
time I check my phone which as you can
imagine is quite a lot
I love trying loci main jinx two here on
the island they grow lemongrass so this
lemon grass juice is also incredible for
hydration next up is skincare current
laboratory has discovered a succulent
plant in Madagascar known as the organic
leaf of life and despite sudden changes
in temperature it was able to remain
full of water the extract is found
within the new hydrate sncl range to
help power the skins natural hydration
the range includes five textures I like
to start with the by face serum which
works for all skin types
my dehydrated skin drinks then straight
away I shake it and then apply a couple
of pumps my clean skin throughout the
day my skin will be kept hydrated and
look radiant
despite the thermic shop
then there are four varieties to choose
from within the Hydra SMC arrange the
milky lotion is SPF 15 and perfect for
normal combination skins it's incredibly
comfortable melting into the skin that
leaving our complexion feeling fresh and
nourished in the pots there's a cooling
gel which gives an immediate of freshing
sensations and leaves you ingredient yet
mattified skin I love this one
especially the full makeup application
then choose silky cream one is an SPF 15
and both works perfectly from normal to
dry skin
my first concur tip while on holiday is
of course SPF I always apply a lotion
especially designed for use on the face
and with SPF 30 is the absolute minimum
pay specific attention to the nose and
hairline as these the area's most likely
to catch the Sun I apply SPF 50 on the
first few days of my holiday and
gradually reduced but never lower than
SPF 30 all over and 22 top up of course
what you put in your body every day and
especially while you travel is hugely
important look for organic and locally
sourced fruits and vegetables on the
menus on the island they've got an
organic garden and some splurt for joys
and a vegetables used after breakfast
fill the body with minerals antioxidants
and defense
my final tip is came to the skin after
sun exposure by regularly exfoliating
with mitts or scrubs will ensure your
tan last longer and dead skin cells are
brushed away leading a smooth skin all
over the body skin that's been exposed
to the Sun should be treated with a
caring after some products on aloe vera
gel to help with the healing with these
five tips you should notice a more
radiant and hydrated healthy complexion
