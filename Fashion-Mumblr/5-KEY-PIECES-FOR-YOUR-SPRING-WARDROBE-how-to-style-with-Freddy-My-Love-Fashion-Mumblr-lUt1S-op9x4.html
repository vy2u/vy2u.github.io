video is going to be all about five key
pieces to stop your wardrobe but I have
a special hello darlings welcome back
today's video is going to be five key
transfer wardrobe for spring and who
better to talk through them with me then
Freddie
13 I have wanted to film together quite
some time and I thought who better to
discuss these key pieces of me than my
style Twitter and Springer's are things
spring is really the last accident our
season over on Freddie's channel we did
10 spring trends that everybody needs in
your wardrobe so if you'd like to find
out about the trends phrase video down
below so definitely check that out
we are going to talk through five key
pieces and shall we start off with lace
so one of our favorite key pieces for
our wardrobes is a lace top so why have
you chosen a particular top reading I
love this one because it can be dressed
up it can be yours down and I love like
this whoops you call it a pie crust
that's right detail I'm around the neck
can be as little cuff stays as well
SuperDuper cute and again just like the
best whole ways to style this which is
pretty cool
yeah we were saying on Freddie's video
that lace has really become a big trend
this year so I think as one of the key
pieces in your wardrobe it's one that
you're going to be you're reaching full
time and time again so here are the ways
that Freddie and I have trust on these
tops up in two different ways nice
outfit so to talk mister your outfit
okay so I pulled for a really casual
kind of boho western vibe as long as the
lace top what you think is a great top
because you could really dress this up
and make it look really elegant but I've
made it look really casual and fun with
a suede button-down skirt I'm not all of
a yes definitely a key piece and also my
new cream western cowboy boots which I'm
obsessed
it's a trend in the spring and cubital
kind of also has a bit of a West survive
because like the fringing understands
understands and also in very trendy
lilac color a really good way of just
like popping a little bit of the lytic
trend into your outfit without going
like full-blown yeah
gorgeous I am obsessed with this bag
it's very new cheap Ives yes yes and
everything about it so affordable as
well just Topshop I have not got such
quite a bottom even on these are all the
kind of premium High Street pieces I've
got my mulberry back because I wanted
this to be a bit of like a daytime
outfit this is from last year's Reiss
collection or they remind have the best
cheapest day that I already read or just
oh my goodness underbrim one it's
actually faux suede it's so soft
I don't me see you writing that one so I
wanted to make my lace top look
appropriate for daytime and I've had it
with trousers which I feel like with
these boots which you guys are probably
bored to death of seen for me wearing so
much I think it makes it a fun kind of
writing yes I don't think that yeah I'm
still thinking that love it I thought
I'd wait you're reading the horse I'm
writing a cat or nano girls for a
business dinner yeah we're both riding
yes exactly that's the time so let us
know whose outfit you prefer and not
that that's what this video is all I do
I do for failure so I won't your friend
is going but this is a kind of outfit
that we we're all time like Freddie and
I are both number one fans of suede
skirt and you can also wear over knee
boots of western boots and things so -
very very wearable ways of styling the
lace top one of the other trends that we
spoke about in my video and the new
jokes both can stall differently is a
Starkel bag we have this one from
Topshop we chose this because it's just
super easy and so affordable as well and
just such a good way to get a new trend
into your wardrobe I think that a circle
bag is one of those pieces that again is
really really versatile we've both gone
for this one which is super affordable
this is Topshop 28 pounds and everything
that we talked about in this video will
be linked at thighs down below but I
think that the circle bag
and it came from obviously the Cloe
handbag it is something that you can
invest in but if you're not quite sure
then at the fort hood when I guess it's
just as cute so let's see how we styled
it so we have gone for very much a
dressed up and dressed down approach to
the circle bag I think it just shows its
versatility it works at both outfit it
really does totally especially like
they're really nice even buying it goes
with the outfit really well I think this
neutral color so I respected everything
it's Italian - right I think dress I
love this dress this is the dress I've
had my wardrobe for awhile I think it's
so beautiful I love the ruffles it's so
feminine and I think about with the
studs kind of like balances out that
really feminine twee like Natalie kind
of baladi vibe so and also I love the
shoes that I've had the dress with these
gorgeous and Valentino Brooks stood oops
from dude this is like trying to melt
around that tubes from June and what's
nice about cubes from June if it
actually still really nice quality and
they're not like you know kind of
misguided like low quality issues they
actually feel amazing and this is very
pretty and they do that beautiful the
colors gorgeous and I love how like the
Stars I kind of went for a bit matching
matchy with the studs it's kind of cool
so it's like a stud versus frills kind
of which I love super you well I am
obsessed with these like comfy chairs of
the moment your hair's ribbon on into
smashing when it comes to like chic but
super comfy so I was just put to fit
these in some way or another I just
thought the loads of knitwear just kind
of highlights how versatile the bag is
if I mean I would wear this outfit to
work from home and then if I was going
if I had like a last-minute meeting or
need us run into town I would just grab
this bag stick on a pair of heels and I
feel like instantly just uplifts you out
there so super versatile and yeah that's
how we stand
so I am always going on about how you
should have a really good quality
plastic nips in your wardrobe and I
think that a basic piece of knitwear is
a real staple in your spring wardrobe so
we had to include one in our spring it
key pieces we've gone for slightly
higher rank this time we've chosen this
gorgeous woolen it from wreath so the
price point is slightly higher however
for this kind of thing it is such a key
piece you will find yourself reaching
for it time and time and year after year
as well yeah and one of those things
that's gonna be like it's such a staple
in your wardrobe you can go back to for
sure I feel like it's the kind of thing
that when you have one in your wardrobe
it makes putting your outfit together
really easy because it just goes to so
many things as we will now demonstrate
Hey so we have both styled up the pink
knit the absolute spring classic water
piece so differently I love what you've
done with a neckline this so the Lazaro
lace top and things with what Josie
cools a foot goes my gallery product I
cross just like stick now looks really
cute and also sticking out of them
sleeves hairs are just tucked into every
casual pair of jeans and we also dress
those up slightly with the Chloe tree
bag and some patent pointcorp shoes love
I love how the jeans and the bag just
since you make like what is essentially
jeans them in their top look thank you
thank you and then I tried to make it a
little bit more kind of I was gonna say
more even you but you can definitely
wear this to like a Barbie finish yeah
so it's so good but you that's like also
quite casual kind of summer Bob q kind
of yeah as well it's really cute I think
sometimes like you don't know what a
dress code is this kind of outfit works
really nicely Freddie and I went to your
charity event a couple of weeks ago and
I just wore knitted jumper and then a
high-waisted skirt and Victoria plain
knit go with so many different things so
I'm wearing some wide leg trousers I
thought I would make it a little bit
more
handy with some pointed toe boots this
is the beautiful stratified from
Victoria's yes his word I've actually
got this back too and what I've got the
one with you plum at the tournament so
cute and then just some very delicate
jewelry to finish off I'm the kind of
always wear the same stay on a piece of
jewelry don't we could just go with
everything so yeah it's a very versatile
easy to wear two ways to stop so another
key piece that we're going to use style
are some cute spring trousers I've gone
for these align the Kwan's
because lining is such a big trend this
spring and I'm just obsessed for their
however I wasn't such a balance and I
look I felt like I think I don't know
when perusing a river island I found
that they had the exact same pair in
this kind of creamy color which i think
is a lot more me yeah I ordered things
as well actually but I know you mean
these are talking more and it's quite
cute it's like the same trouser but you
can kinda see ya cute and they've got
this lovely ruffle detail at the bottom
a ruffle is still a huge trend and
pearls
we both love pearls also us we both kind
of agreed that with this start up
trouser but you do need to size up
berries I would normally go for six I
think that as you'll soon see there are
a little bit on the tight side and minor
eight and they are tight like there are
tight and we don't wearable that are
tight yes I think it's a little bit more
comfortable we've got a bit more room in
them but we're now gonna show you how
this kind of Charles R can be starred up
in the evening how it can be made really
casual in the daytime maybe just with a
switch of shoes that kind of thing so
I'm excited to see how you start I know
I know I'm not this is my favorite
outfit of mine I think
I suppose for my mouth this is hmm bow
sits there lovely I think it looks way
more expensive than it is like a little
baby goes I'm applying about a
bone have some fuzzy bones ever people I
get dressed up and evening out look with
the trousers private some heels it was
really cute like white stumble bags why
I spend in French Connection it's really
cute and I just love like the whites a
minor I think they just pop just so much
yeah nothing this outfit make it's
really fun it is so cute and as I said I
couldn't pass the line across ah I think
I feel like love I'm straddled up the
cream ones everyone I mean I thought you
know what I actually found these I'm
choosing my wardrobe and I realized and
ages since I wore them and because they
have the pearl detail as well which
mimics the pearls in the ruffles thought
I pad together
dress down flats but then I've gone for
quite a smart t-shirt I think they're
just cause you're wearing a t-shirt
doesn't have you super crush stunning it
isn't it yeah it is very tiny little
pearl so yeah but pulse again and then I
thought this is a kind of outfit that I
wear up for Dave meetings so I got this
really big like a peacock we're kind of
coordinating aisle that's pretty much it
was really beautiful blue and you're
just gonna fit your laptop you for
everything in here so very practical
dress down just up there's such pastimes
houses are they yeah they are I think
like as many sometimes like a little
wider will I not do make a real life
it's very cool yeah I'm never taking you
to a little a treat with gold frets but
yeah I can handle that because they look
super cute and our final key piece in
the spring wardrobe and I've already
been loving at the midi skirt trend I've
been wearing it so much I think midi
skirts just to cut across let me cut see
your thing just loves but I see them as
your thing either
I think this is probably like the first
one in my collection I'm not gonna lie
but I think they are so elegant I think
that again you can really dress them up
and down and I just feel really
confident when I'm in them I don't like
wearing things that are too short I just
feel like they work with so many
different occasions as well I'm a
miniskirt girl and much more than a
minute they are super pretty so I think
this was going to be sort of challenging
one fused you find a hard to start well
I don't wear them and I love how they
look you're kind of my miniskirt inspo
that when I think of minis guys
obviously do you think of you I don't
wear them I'm so much more of a mini
Scout though so what actually challenge
but it's nice like I said this in my
video that like unless you kind of push
your style boundaries always kind of
them you're wearing the same thing and
as I don't you don't want that to happen
so yeah it was cool I'm glad that you
pushed me my comfort zone are we so
interested to see if you now start like
veering towards miniskirts and wearing
them or are potentially the kind of
thing where once you try it on and you
realize how wearable they are you buy
the more it kind of skip not scary thing
you know those things that are just a
little bit like over knee boots and asks
you what about my god I don't want
anything else no I don't you don't
anything awful an outfit together that's
all I'm going to say miniskirt so keep
an eye on Freddie's Instagram let's see
you never started tying up miniskirts
so and let's see how Freddie nice start
up this beautiful one from Reese yeah
floaty oh my goodness it's got such a do
you know what they call this is like a
knife Pete wearing groans and spits him
so different you're saying you have a
scar like James Corden I do sorry
yeah this is how you can style it a
little bit more casually this is more
casual but it's a bit more like it kind
of rocks it up a bit yeah make sense I
don't know Mike I've got really rocky
because it's you know eminent but you've
made it a lot more wearable yeah exactly
so it's a black high neck really plain
and nice and fitted as well and and just
some black ankle boots or which i think
looks really cool and of course is
beautiful and top and or Aspen or bag
it's just like a really beautiful smooth
shiny leather and I just think it kind
of looks so it's very sophisticated
like kind of city chic but a little bit
more cool mm-hmm I feel like this would
be really good outfit for desk to bar
yeah yeah yeah station updates I do yeah
yes to disco disco yeah so so cute and
then I've just made it even more girly
than it already was top which is Ted
Baker you may have seen this my
Instagram to times love these kind of
frill and details structure as well
yeah exactly it's nice contrast at the
Florina so these guys see that floaty on
the skirt and then structured on the
shoulders I'm obsessed with this bag at
the moment you twirl is similar in style
by Chloe very true but this one is not
designer and then shoes I kept it all
very pink different shades of dusky pink
really like these I find that these are
very versatile for dressing up and down
well Jessica please find these are
really versatile for dressing up lots of
different things you've got machines may
scare that's maxi skirts so yeah let us
know what you think do you think Freddie
should wear miniskirts more thing I
don't know I think I would definitely
