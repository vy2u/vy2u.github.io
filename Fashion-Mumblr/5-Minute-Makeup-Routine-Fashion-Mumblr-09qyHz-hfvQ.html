lovely day today or this morning I'm in
a little bit of a rush so I thought what
better time than now to show you my 5
minute makeup routine I've pretty much
honed the skill I like to think of
getting ready in a rush some days I just
don't want to spend too much time on
makeup because I've got other things to
be doing and some days I'm just in a
rush like I need to get out the house
I'd never leave myself enough time so
yeah pretty much got my 5 minute makeup
routine down to a tee
so I thought I would share that with you
today a little disclaimer the lighting
is disgusting it's pretty much dark
outside so I'm relying on my lumps so um
yeah makeup free Josie is rather scary
so prepare yourselves for that but I
hope you guys find this useful
no more rambling and let's get started
with my 5 minute makeup routine so the
first thing that I'm going to do is
apply the benefit Porefessional Matt's
rescue and this is a really great
multitasker because it is pore
minimizing and also mattifying so you
can skip the moisturizer because this
just gives your skin at the moisture
that it needs unmask Faiz it ready for
the makeup so I'm just gonna loosely
spread that using my fingers onto my
face and then I'm going in with the
bourgeois city radiance brightening
effects foundation and the reason why
I'm choosing this one today is just
because it's very very quick to blend
so again just dotting it onto the areas
that need some coverage on some days I
probably just use concealer but because
I'm quite red and patchy as you can see
I definitely need foundation today and
I'm just using the zoeva 206 silk finish
brush to blend this all in so you can
see that that went on really really
quickly and in fact I do want a little
bit more coverage on the cheeks and I
think I've just about got time I'm just
gonna use a little bit more of the same
bourgeois just again Pat it again on the
cheeks and whatever's left on the chin
and I've got to make sure I blend it
down into the neck as well because I
have been using a little bit of fake tan
recently and definitely don't want to be
left with a neat
lines so because this stuff is really
blendable it's perfect for days when
you're in a rush because you can just
keep on adding it if you're not happy
with the finish make sure you blend it
down the chin don't forget that bit even
if you're rushing and next from the same
range I'm going to use the bourgeois
radiance reveal concealer I think this
is a really really good drugstore
concealer it definitely rivals NARS and
by Terry and all those other concealers
I've been loving and again what makes it
great for morning's like this is it's
just SuperDuper easy and quick to blend
in so I just applied it with the
applicator and now just use my finger to
tap the majority of it in before I go
back in with the zoeva brush I'm also
gonna put some up here and then on my
chin as well just cuz it needs a little
bit more coverage and then wherever it
is this brush so you don't have too many
too keen or to find when you're in a
rush and just using the same brush to
Pat that all in and by the way I already
put some serum on before I started this
but I skipped the moisturizer because we
didn't have time for that to sink in and
because I'm still looking a little bit
shiny I'm gonna go in with some powder
just to set the makeup in place but also
stop it sliding around for the rest of
the day I'm using the Tarte Amazonian
clay powder just tapping off the excess
patting it on the different areas and
then just really quickly blending it in
and this is the brush that it came with
I think it's just called the tuck kabuki
brush I'll leave it down below if that's
not right so I'll leave everything down
below anyway but as you can see this
really quickly just kind of instantly
mattifies the skin which is exactly what
we need and because I wouldn't leave the
house without doing my eyebrows the next
thing they're gonna do is just fill the
main quite loosely and quickly just
using the natural brow shape and I'm
filling them in with my urban decay brow
visa I find this so quick and easy to
use I just draw a line underneath my
brows and then fill in any gaps which I
have quite a few of just at the
beginning here and if you get a pencil
that's as close as possible to your
natural brow color
it won't be too much of a drama if you
do it a little bit messy like I'm doing
now and there's also a spoolie in the
other end so you can just smooth them
out and check that you've got a good
shape and it only takes a couple of
seconds to put some brow gel through
some using benefits gimme brow just to
add a little bit more of that
much-needed volume to the brows and also
to set them in place a little bit better
so in a couple of seconds brows are done
and next I'm gonna grab my naked smoky
palette and I'm going to use some quite
natural shades not that one I'm going to
use combust and the one next to it which
is whiskey just to use a really basic
very very quick smokey eye so I'm using
combust which is the lighter shade all
over the lid and I'm just using the
brush that came in the palette because I
don't have time to look for another one
so the lighter shade is going just all
over the lid I'm not being precise at
all here and then I'm gonna really
lightly tap the brush on the wispy shade
just to use in the crease because I find
that gives the itis a little bit more
definition and then keeping the eye open
I'm just using the brush in like a semi
circle kind of shape on the crease of
the eyelid and then I'm just gonna blend
like crazy just to make sure that it's
all fully blended and we don't have any
weird shapes going on these shadows are
great because they really do blend in
seconds so it's perfect for those
mornings when you don't have ages and
ages to build a perfect smokey eye and
for eyeliner I find the L'Oreal super
liner really quickly easy to use just
because it's so thin the nib is really
really fine so I find it's super quick
just to draw a quick line on the actual
lash line so I'm not going to be too
precise just keeping it really really
close to the lash line and bring it out
into a little cat flick because it
always makes me feel as though my
makeups a little bit more done if I've
got a Catholic ok did a little bit too
much on that eye that never mind he'll
hide it with mascara and because I don't
have time to curl my lashes I'm going to
use benefit roll
I have this mini one which I keep in my
gym bag which is usually where I am
doing my speedy makeup and this really
does curl the lashes as well as separate
them so a good mascara to use if you
don't have time to curl your lashes so
I'm just gonna wiggle it really really
close to the eyelid and pull it out
revealing it nice fluttery lashes I find
that often only one coat of this is
enough as well so again great in those
time-saving circumstances and I'm not
going to put any on my bottom lashes
because firstly I don't have time and
secondly if I'm rushing that I'm
probably tired as well and it does tend
to make the eyes look a little bit wider
if you leave out the bottom lashes and
then second to last step I'm just going
to give my face a little bit of shape
with some bronzer and I'm using the
Estee Lauder
bronze goddess just because I know this
one is not going to turn me orange and I
can just really quickly bring some shape
into the face so I'm going to start by
doing a kind of a contour shape just on
the cheekbones and then that figure
three movement to bring some shape into
the forehead and under the chin so you
can see it's a really natural color so
even though I'm rushing and not being
too careful I'm not at risk of going
orange which is a bonus bring it down to
the neck and if you use this kind of
pouting action then it almost acts as a
contour as well so you're killing two
birds with one stone if that movement
and this is the charlotte tilbury
bronzing brush and then finally just to
complete the look I'm going to use a
very safe option for lipstick which is
my favorite bite Beauty matte lip creme
lip crayon in the shade urato and this
is kind of like a foolproof lipstick I
know that the shade suits every makeup
look and because of the quite precise
bullet applicator it's really quick and
easy to use because it's quite fine you
can almost line the lips with it and
then fill them in quite hard trying to
talk when you're doing a lipstick and
we're done so that is it this is the
finished look I don't think we've done
too badly given the time restraints the
eyes are probably not as precise as I
would have liked them to have been this
one has a lot more eyeliner on it than
the other one and yeah but we did we can
five minutes as I said I have created
this look quite a few times it's almost
my everyday makeup routine but and a
little bit more of a hurry than I would
normally do by no means do you have to
do all of these things if you feel like
you can leave the house without bronzer
without lipstick without doing shading
in your eyes then be my guest but for me
personally this is what I like to do on
a daily basis when I'm leaving the house
or going to work or anything like that
this for me is the minimum that I can do
on my face without feeling like an
absolute god-knows-what so hopefully
you've picked up a few little tips and
tricks of ways for multitasking your
makeup or getting your makeup done in a
little bit more of a hurry whether
you're rushing to school rushing to work
or you just don't want to be spending
too long doing your makeup I'd say my
top tips are make sure you're using
products that you're really familiar
with for me the bronzer I'm having a
bronze that I'm really familiar with the
color and I know that it's not going to
look to you Orange E is really really
crucial and also with the lip color I
know that I can't go wrong with this one
it's my failsafe lip color which you'll
know if you watch my top 10 at 2015
Buick products so for me having products
that I know really well just means I can
be very quick when it comes to doing my
makeup having a foundation that's really
quick and blendable as well is a huge
huge time saver both this and the Rimmel
match perfection foundation are really
really easy to blend and having a decent
blending brush it definitely helps as
well of course prepping your skin is
really really crucial when it comes to
doing your makeup in a rush there's no
point in skipping out your skincare
routine all together because you'll find
that your makeup just doesn't sit in
place now where you take you longer than
if you had done a skincare routine in
the first place so I definitely would
recommend not skipping out the cleansing
part of your routine but you can skip
out the moisturizer if you have a primer
or maybe even a BB cream that does that
step for you hopefully you found this
useful guys and have enjoyed this little
five-minute makeup routine if you have

thumbs up as you know and subscribe if
