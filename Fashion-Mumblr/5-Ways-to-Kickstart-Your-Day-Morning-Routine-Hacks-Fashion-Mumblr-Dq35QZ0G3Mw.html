having a really really fab day today in
this video I wanted to talk to you about
few simple things you can do to really
kickstart your day so I am a major major
morning person I get most of my kind of
hard jobs done first thing in the
morning I like to just get everything
out the way I'm usually up and out of
bed by around 6:30 but whether you are a
morning person like me or not I truly
believe that there are a few small
things that you can do to really give
your day an amazing start so have you
ever had one of those days where
everything goes wrong I'm talking about
when your alarm doesn't go off so you
wake up late you don't have time to get
ready properly and then you end up being
on like the worst tube at 8:30 a.m. on
the Northern Line is not the place you
want to be or maybe you get stuck in
traffic you're right to work late you
miss your first meeting and then you
realize your tops on backwards
those kind of mornings and then I think
that if you start the day on a bad note
everything else just seems to go wrong
and everything keeps unrolling in a bad
way so what I like to do is ensure that
my morning gets off to a really really
good start and then it all goes uphill
from there that's what I find anyway so
I have five key things which I like to
do every single morning which really
helped me to kick start my day and I
thought I would share them with you in
today's video number one is energized I
like to set my alarm half an hour
earlier than what I think it really
needs to be in order to get a few extra
steps into my morning routine the first
thing that I absolutely love to do and I
found myself getting into a habit of
doing recently is meditating and it only
takes two minutes
so I find that I have very very busy
days I work for myself so I like to
always be super productive every day but
I always allow myself just 2 minutes of
meditating and I've been using an app
called leaf which came with my Bella
beat necklace which you might have
spotted in my last favorites video and
they have two minute or 10 minute
meditation options I currently am doing
two-minute option but in a few weeks I
think I'll step it up to the ten minute
option and by meditating just for a
couple of minutes in the morning it
gives you a few moments to yourself
just concentrating on your breathing
it's not only relax you but really
energize you for the day ahead and I
cannot tell you how much difference this
makes to my energy levels throughout the
day I highly highly recommend it and
it's just so quick and easy another
thing you can do to energize yourself in
the morning is to have a really lovely
shower it doesn't have to be long just a
few minutes but I find this really
invigorates me and gets me ready for the
day ahead so I'm currently working with
original source who have just released a
range of shower milks to help you shake
up your shower routine I hope so you
love using a new product to invigorate
myself in the morning and these new
shower milks are really creamy and
moisturizing and as you can imagine from
original source they smell out of this
world so there's four new flavors sweet
apple and vanilla milk green banana and
bamboo milk lime and coconut milk and my
all-time favorite cherry and almond milk
so these are all made with vegan milk
extracts and 100% natural moisturizers
and fragrances the best part is that
only two pound 20 each and you can pick
them up in your supermarket shop from
places like Tesco once I'm feeling
totally refreshed from my lovely shower
then it's ready to do step two which is
personal productivity personally I find
it relaxes me and also helps me organize
my mind if I do a few things to really
set out what I want to achieve during
the day ahead I'm a big big fan of to-do
lists when I used to work in an office
the first thing I would do would be to
write myself an email with the top
things I mean just do that date and even
now I still find myself scribbling away
in a notebook and writing down the
things that I hope to achieve that day
another tip is to tackle the small
things first so if you've got some
really small things like ordering a
birthday card for example that's going
to take between two and five minutes so
just get that done first things you can
tick things off that way your list will
be a lot shorter and more manageable by
the time you have your first morning
coffee
number three is nutrition and we all
know how important it is to have a
really good breakfast at the beginning
of the day for our body and for our mind
as well you'll find you're a lot more
productive and efficient if you have
some really good nutrition in your body
to kick start the day so personally I
like to make sure of my breakfast is fun
that it looks good it tastes good
and it's healthy as well and my current
favorite thing to make is a smoothie
bottle they're so easy to make you just
start off with full main ingredients
which is some natural yogurt
some almond milk some frozen banana and
some frozen raspberries if you're super
organized like me you can even freeze a
load of fruit together chopped up peeled
stick it all in the freezer and freezer
bag and then all you have to do is tip
that into your blender first thing in
the morning sometimes I like to add in a
few extra things like I've got a healthy
oat mix of some chia seeds some shredded
coconut or whatever you whatever flavors
you like just stick it all in there I
blend it all up in my beloved thermomix
and then I like to make the top really
pretty by adding in some frozen
blueberries some more raspberries
almonds I just love the crunch of
almonds and even some dark chocolate if
I'm feeling extremely indulgent and this
is a really lovely very naturally sweet
and very healthy breakfast I find that
because of the oats in this particular
recipe
it keeps me full for quite a long time
so I don't find myself nibbling
throughout the day which is a really
good sign from the old waistline number
four is happiness and it is so important
to do something in the morning that
makes you happy going back to what I
said at the beginning about small things
in the morning really having an impact
on the way the rest of the day unfolds I
think that if you do one thing within
the first couple of hours of waking up
to make you really happy then that is a
really good sign for how the rest of the
day is going to pan out so this can be
something really small like writing a
happiness journal I absolutely love
writing in my happiness journal or my
mindful journal or it can be something
like hugging your pet or your boyfriend
I just find that when I cuddle Dexter
for a few minutes makes me so happy and
those good feelings tend to last on the
rest of the day if I've come home from
work after a really bad day then equally
cuddling him will instantly make me feel
much better so try to do one thing in
the morning that really makes you feel
happy and something else I learned from
the secret which I finished reading a
few weeks ago is to smile so by smiling
you're almost tricking your body
into thinking that you're happy even
when you may not be and again this
generates good things to happen to you
throughout the rest of the day
honestly just try it it really really
works and finally number five is
exercise and I know not everybody has
time to go to the gym or even do a
seven-minute workout first thing in the
morning so you can do something as
simple as cutting out the bus from your
commute to work perhaps this is what I
used to do when I was rushed in the
mornings didn't have time to do a small
bit of exercise then I would just walk
to the tube instead of getting the bus
to the tube we all know we should be
doing around 10,000 steps a day if you
work in an office and this can be really
really hard so try to just make a small
change in the morning so that you have a
little bit of exercise in your morning
routine because once again this releases
endorphins it makes you happy who else
remembers that because of leave tube
tongued endorphins make you happy moving
it back to the video and bit yeah
exercise has a really good impact on the
rest of your day gives you so much
energy and makes you feel much better
about yourself so those are my top five
tips on how to kick start your day and
ensure you have a really good day every
day
hopefully you guys will try some of
these things out if you do then to eat
me or snapchat me I'll leave all my
information as always down below
honestly some of these things are just
so simple they take just a few moments
to do and I cannot explain to you the
impact that they have on your day so
don't just watch this video and then
forget about it honestly try these
things you'll be amazed at how much of a
difference they have so guys I hope you
