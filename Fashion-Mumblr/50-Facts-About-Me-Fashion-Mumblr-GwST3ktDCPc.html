today's video and I hope you guys having
a really good day I decided to film a 50
facts about me video today you might
have seen in my last weekly vlog that
when I was in Germany I could not sleep
for god knows how long and I just
entertain myself by watching a lot of
youtubers 50 facts about me videos
starting off with my friend Hannah's and
unlink Hezbollah because she's so funny
and yeah it was really entertaining and
I thought you know what I'm gonna give
that a go a few of you in the past have
asked me to do a fact about me video but
I was like really are you gonna find it
that interesting but after watching a
few other youtubers doing I thought you
know what there are a few things that
you might find a little bit entertaining
I almost wanted to do kind of like a
disclaimer but then I thought no I'm not
going to do it a favor
I'm not gonna apologize for saying some
of these facts because yeah they might
sound a little bit showy yaffe but at
the end of the day they're facts about
me and some of these things some of
these achievements I worked really
really hard for and yeah I just don't
really think we should be apologetic or
swipe RT months under the carpet I'm one
of these people that I get a little bit
embarrassed when I'm like oh yeah I did
really well in my a levels or things
like that it's just almost in British
society you don't pick yourself up and I
think it's a bit of a shame so if you
guys are on YouTube and haven't made a
50 facts about me video then I suggest
you do it and don't be afraid to talk
about things that you've achieved
because why should we keep them under
the carpet we do work really really hard
sometimes and yeah
so a slight ramble aside let's do this
and these are in no particular order by
the way I've got them all written down
the notes section of my phone and yeah
really really random so let's get
started
number one my first attention was when I
was in year 3 and this is for supposedly
taking money from my classmates because
basically my best friend and I when we
were 7 years old
we got a book about fortunes and reading
people's fortunes and dreams so we used
to charge 10 P reading people's fortunes
and I got detention for it cuz prior
you're not allowed to make money in the
playground number two my first and only
car was a peugeot 206cc which he has the
means convertible
and yet a carnivore is really cool poser
in my little / show I don't have that
car anymore there because I live in
London and don't we have a need for it
although kind of thinking about getting
another one number three I once saw
Michael McIntyre in the mulberry
concession at Selfridges and I'm pretty
sure that that's where he made up the
joke that some little clutch hand bags
cost more than if you were to hire a
little man to follow you around the
opposition's all the time because he was
mumbling about that kind of thing while
we were shopping number four I used to
be addicted to Neopets and I was younger
I can still remember my user name little
Joey 10 and I also used to run a guild
called dogs at Worlds leave me a comment
if you can remember gills in Neopets or
am i showing my age number 5 I'm gonna
stop saying the numbers because I'm
gonna forget them and it's gonna get
really confusing when I was younger I
used to live in a small town in
Herefordshire called Rossum why and my
parents owned a sweet shop called greyer
and greyer is apparently a Welsh of
battlecry relating to that one it also
was younger I typed kweli into Facebook
with the aim of setting up a Facebook
group for our shop and they actually
found a group called we all used to
steal penny sweets from Chloe when we
were younger also when I was younger I
used to have a crush on Mufasa from The
Lion King I also used to have a crush on
the beast from Beauty and the Beast
maybe that says something about my taste
in guys I am scared of spiders
daddy longlegs and anything that moves
unnaturally quickly I have a mullah
banana crunch corn in yogurt for
breakfast pretty much every morning I
passed my driving test for the first
time while wearing six-inch heels yes
really I used to find it easier to pivot
on the heels because my feet are so
small I couldn't reach the pedals
otherwise when I was younger my dream
job was to be a marine biologist I also
wanted to never have a car and drive
around only by horse and carriage for my
a-levels I studied English textiles
economics
Spanish and photography and I got
straight A's and a stars I have never
been to Nando's the first-ever gig that
I went to was busted and the warm-up act
was McFly I have a little scar on my
neck from when I contracted tuberculosis
when I was little I'm secretly really
good at playing the didgeridoo
I once wrote a full page article in
sugar magazine called best friend versus
boyfriend I used to make him sell
jewelry they look like yield sweets like
licorice allsorts and love hearts on a
website called fiction jewelry for my
school Sixth Form bull or prom if you're
American
I couldn't find a dress that I liked and
that I can afford so I decided to make
one when I was younger I had the
weirdest obsession with the Titanic and
I could probably list off about a
million facts about the Titanic still to
this day I can still recite the oral
part of my Spanish a level exam for
summer stock happiness and last mile
vive sizzle next video yeah my first CD
was shaggy angel I don't like fizzy
drinks I have never tried a cigarette or
any drugs and I plan to keep it that way
I studied fashion management at the
London College of Fashion of my
university degree and I got a first when
I was younger I used to collect
Sabrina's secrets magazine and S Club
Style magazine in my class one Nativity
I was Mary I call my mum la la ll which
stands for lady large and that's a long
story so I'm not going to explain why
when I'm stressed I write to-do lists
because it makes me feel better not
having it all going round in my head I
can't decide my favorite ice cream
flavor but my top three have to be
strawberry pistachio and raspberry
ripple my boyfriend Charlie and I
actually met on holiday while we were
both in the Maldives my favorite food is
macaroni cheese and my recipe is the
best recipe in the whole wide world I'm
really really bad at receiving
compliments if you give me one I
probably will just get flustered and try
and find a way of bringing myself down
again I got 100% in my textiles a level
which meant that I was top in the
country for that year I have a weird
phobia of using escalators that aren't
moving I first ever human crush was
Brian McFadden from Westlife and after
that it was Leo DiCaprio I even had an
email address that was Joey at Leo fans
calm when I was in primary school I
dated a boy that was way cooler than me
but after a week he sent me a text
saying welcome to dumpsville that was my
first-ever breakup I can do the whole
rap from lethal Bissell's police on my
back and now I'm not gonna do it right
now when I was 18 I spent a month in
Tanzania and I climbed to the very top
of Mount Kilimanjaro my first-ever blog
post was about interning at Mulberry
which I did during my second and third
years at uni I have red currant jelly
with most of my meals I moved out of
home when I was 18 years old and that
was to go to university and my first
flat in London was in Southwark my
middle names are Harriet Mary so we're
full name is Josephine Harriet Mary fear
I have a half-brother called Jamie and
we have the same mom but different dad
but I never think of him as my
half-brother he's just my brother
I'm also an auntie to three beautiful
children called Courtney Brandon and
Austin me and Charlie are both really
really crazy when it comes to talking to
Dexter we have so many nicknames for him
such as d-money dee splash Dexter Rooney
gangster dog the list goes on I also
make up songs about my pets Dara Singh
neither Coco and Lois song but most
expensive thing that I own other than my
house which is definitely the most
expensive thing is probably my mulberry
Cecily handbag but I still bought that
with my stock discount when I worked at
mulberry I think that's the most
expensive thing well you like I like and
that's it they are all the facts that I
have to share with you guys I think I
was about 50 I know some down my phone
and counted them very roughly so
hopefully 50 or thereabout
hopefully find this video entertaining
and you found out a lot and you found
out a little bit more about me I would
love to know about you are you secretly
as crazy as I am if so tell me a really
fun and crazy fact about you down the
comments below I'd absolutely love that
