joining me for today's video which is
going to be a new fashion video and a
spring fashion video I feel like I've
waited so long to say that we are
finally on the run-up to spring and I'm
so excited for all of the spring fashion
videos that are going to be coming your
way very very soon it is my absolute
favorite season when it comes to fashion
and no surprise is why I love florals I
love lace I love sheer fabrics I love
puzzles
and all of those things come back into
fashion year after year in spring time
if this sounds like the kind of fashion
that you love as well then please hit
the subscribe button so you don't miss
any of my upcoming spring fashion videos
and fashion videos generally throughout
the year so today is a little bit of an
introduction to spring fashion I'm going
to be going through the trends that I'm
most excited about trends that we saw on
the catwalk last season and how to wear
them now so I'm going to be going
through maybe my top five or six trends
what items I've got in my wardrobe at
the moment which means I'm starting to
inject those trends into my style now
and also just a little bit of a chitchat
on how to wear the trends generally and
which ones I think are worth investing
in you guys know the drill already but
everything that I mentioned in today's
video will be linked in the description
box down below so just click show more
and you'll find links to every single
item that I mentioned as well as links
to what I'm wearing now the lipstick
that I'm wearing even my jewelry and
things like that all the information you
need just click down below okay so I'm
gonna get started with the first trend
that I'm really excited about and it's
actually one that I'm wearing right now
and it is the sheer trend from
show-stopping sheer gowns at Mazzoni to
totally transparent fabrics on the
Chanel catwalks transparency and
Sheerness is a trend that is going to be
absolutely huge this next season when it
comes to clothing there are some really
really wearable ways of injecting that
into your spring wardrobe for example
just making an element of your garment
sheer this top in particular has sheer
sleeves really voluminous sleeves as
well and voluminous sleeves is another
trend that is not going anywhere this
spring season you might also have
spotted me wearing this jumper a lot I'm
obsessed with this jumper and actually
whenever I wear it out in public so many
people come up to me in the street or
when I wore this on Valentine's Day to
go see the Lion King
so many people came up to me asking
where I was from
and it is an affordable high street
piece it's got this sheer panel on the
sleeves and then this beautiful floral
applique detail as well a really
stunning statement piece and I have been
wearing this with jeans and also with
high-waisted skirts so this top and the
floral sleeve one I'd say are really
really wearable ways of just having a
little nod to the trend in your outfit
if you want to go a little bit more for
example like on the Mazzoni catwalk
where we did see those full-length gowns
with the sheer material and piqué detail
this dress from Topshop is a really good
way of channeling at that trend I think
if you've got any spring garden parties
coming up any christenings and weddings
this one is absolutely beautiful it's
also got cutout detail on the shoulders
and then beautiful beautiful detail on
the sleeves you've got almost like
pearly sequins sewn on applique flowers
as well and it's a really elegant length
it goes to just below the knees I will
insert a Tryon clip here so you can see
but just an absolutely beautiful dress
that I'm so excited to wear in
springtime if you want to take that
trend one step further and go whole hog
with the transparency trend as we've
seen with handbags such as the Valentino
handbags and Chanel then perhaps look to
your accessories to really embody that
trend if a trend is a little bit more
statement I'll tend to inject it into my
wardrobe in outfits with accessories
rather than clothing
I just find it a lot more versatile and
easy to wear that way so for
transparency can you see it this is a
bag from Aspinall it's their line bag
and it is absolutely stunning you have
to think quite carefully about what you
pop inside here obviously you want to
make sure that whatever's inside looks
really cute so a pretty person lovely
little makeup bag your favorite lipstick
because it is on display for the world
to see but the bag itself is just
absolutely stunning it's the same size
as my trunk bags from Aspen all of which
as you guys know I absolutely love a
really lovely statement piece to finish
off your outfit because it's so bold
people will really notice the handbag
you'll get a lot of questions about this
no doubt and I'm really excited to style
this up over perhaps a pastel colored
coat for springtime and then into summer
for summer events as well this trend is
going to be hanging around right into
the autumn season okay next up we have a
color trend and you've probably already
spotted it whether that's at the moment
during Fashion Week you've seen people
wearing it and it is the color lilac or
purple periwinkle I think I actually
mentioned it in my video which was 20
eighteen trends to watch out for I
mentioned that periwinkle and Lila are
going to be big this year and now that
we're coming into spring at their time
is coming once again if you're not ready
to quite dress head-to-toe in lilac then
I don't blame you I'm not either so it's
really good to look to your accessories
just to inject a little bit of that
trend into your outfit I have chosen
this adorable little bag from Topshop
this lilac shade is absolutely spot on
when it comes to the Pantone for the
trend that is in season and it also has
another trend on there which is this
beautiful pearl detail and the fringe
detail which is very reminiscent of more
designer handbags so it's something like
this it's a really lovely way of just
adding a nod to a trend without dressing
head-to-toe in the look means you can
keep the majority of your outfit really
classic really timeless and as I'm sure
you guys know that's what most of my
wardrobe is made up of but something
like this just an affordable accessory
from the high street brings that spring
trend right into your wardrobe there are
also a few new investment pieces in my
wardrobe which give a nod to that lilac
trend and they are incredibly wearable
first of all these leather boots from L
K Bennett these are in the sale at the
moment which i think is crazy because
they are so on trend for spring so
comfortable the heel is just a really
lovely height I have been wearing them
four full days at a time and no pain
whatsoever are super comfortable and the
leather the quality of these is
absolutely incredible so I thought I
would mention these briefly because the
shade of these is so on trend for spring
and there are an amazing price at the
moment I'll leave these linked down
below and then in a very similar shade
one more accessory I picked up some new
badger I think that's how you say it
flats from Nicholas Kirkwood these are
be wearing with white jeans with cropped
denim jeans as well and again a really
nice way of having lilac in my outfit
but just keeping it to my accessories so
it's a very subtle nod to the trend this
next one is probably my favorite trend
and it's the most unsurprising one at
all comes back year after year
you guessed it it is pastels that's
probably the main reason why I love
spring because I pretty much wear
pastels all year round but in springtime
they are absolutely on trend so I'm
gonna very quickly go through a few of
my personal favorites firstly I have a
new coat I haven't actually worn this
one yet and it is from revolve but the
brand is Tularosa we are still seeing
these really cuddly fabrics being very
much on trend so this one I'll be
wearing a lot on chilly mornings and I
just
something to snuggle up in but this
pastel pink shade is so on trend for
spring it is a cropped jacket so this is
going to look really great with skirts
midi skirts suede skirts all that kind
of thing during spring time you could
also throw something like this over the
shoulders if you just want a little bit
of extra warmth perhaps you're going to
a party where you're going to be there
into the early evening and you don't
want to feel that evening chill it just
popping something like this around the
shoulders is a really really lovely way
of adding a trend into your wardrobe in
a very practical way I have lots of
outerwear for the Pastore trend because
I think there's something so lovely
about wearing a color other than black
when it comes to your outerwear
sometimes I feel like when I'm wearing
my pink coat walking down Oxford Street
or on the tube and everyone else is
there and their monochrome outfits I
just feel a little bit more special have
a bit more of a spring in my step you do
stand out that's for sure but I think in
a good way this is a really lovely way
of having a past all colored out we're
in a very very wearable very versatile
and classic coat it is a Ted Baker
cashmere coat I absolutely adore the Ted
Baker cashmere coats they have this
beautiful waterfall detail on the
neckline which looks so stunning no
matter what you've got underneath even
something like this with the lace detail
just peeping through really really
beautiful cashmere of course as a
natural fiber it's very breathable so
you won't get too warm in this when we
do get those slightly warmer
temperatures but on those chilly spring
mornings it's going to keep you nice and
snuggly as well you guys have probably
seen me wearing this one already if you
follow me on instagram or if you've been
watching my outfit Diaries this is a
real favorite of mine it's my reece
pastel pink II almost lilac blush
colored coat every pink synonym out
there the shape of this is so
spectacular
it's almost Cape like in the way that it
falls but oh my goodness I will insert a
photo me wearing it here and hopefully
I'll see what I mean the way that this
finishes an outfit is absolutely
stunning Rhys always apps email it when
it comes to tailoring and you can really
see the efforts they've gone through
with the design of this as you can
probably tell I'm absolutely smitten I
love wearing this just over my shoulders
or with my arms through the sleeves
tying in at the waist it is such a
beautiful piece a really lovely
lightweight coat but surprisingly warm
and I'm going to be wearing this so much
throughout spring and because it is so
classic and so well made is
to be in fashion year after year so
definitely worth the investment I've
said in videos before that I think Reese
coats a fabulous value for money because
they're so timeless and you can really
see the quality in the design so I'm a
huge huge fan of this one so prepare to
see this a lot more in my upcoming
outfit Diaries and Instagram pictures
etc past doors don't have to be limited
to outerwear it sometimes it's really
fun to wear some pastel colored jeans
these are some new ones from Ted Baker
and they are coated personally I really
love the effect of coated jeans you get
that shine but not the sometimes
slightly strange fit of leather trousers
but a very very similar effect these are
like a lilac II pink they look fabulous
with a light-colored knit if you've got
perhaps a chunky white knits that would
look absolutely gorgeous with these or
if you have any more statement tops like
the one that I'm wearing now again they
will look absolutely gorgeous almost
forgot about this one one more pastel
color trend this you guys absolutely
love this in my unboxing video that I
did last week this is a beautiful pastel
pink trenchcoat from lip see the color
of this is so me I really do feel a
little bit like Elle Woods Legally
Blonde when I wear this coat once again
you've got beautiful gold buttons you've
got a lovely tie at the waist here so
you can really cinch it in and get that
beautiful feminine silhouette but at the
end of the day this is a classic trench
coat I think if you live in London
during springtime a trench coat like
this really is a wardrobe staple very
British very timeless and once again at
the kind of style that comes back into
fashion year after year
another color that is very much on trend
this spring and once again one that
you've probably already seen cropping up
in high street stores and it is mustard
mustard is a color that I'm not sure if
I can pull off yet so I'm looking to the
high street for there's more affordable
pieces and just seeing how well they
work with my existing wardrobe I picked
up this skirt from Topshop I actually
have surprised myself with how much I
really like this color mustard I think
it's very flattering it's really bright
really fun and it just makes you think
of summer instantly it's so really
surprisingly wearable shade as well as
this there are also some gorgeous
mustard colored knits in Karen Millen I
did a blog post very similar to this
video all about spring trends and I'm
excited to wear I'll leave that link
down below because for each of these
trends i've mentioned including mustard
I've made like a little shoppable widget
with all of my favorites from the high
street so leave that link down below
check
if you want some more ideas but this
with a lovely cashmere knit or as it
gets a bit warmer with perhaps a white
silk t-shirt there's a really fun and
wearable way of getting that mustard
trend into your robe I think I've said
this about every trend so far but
another trend that I'm very excited
about is pearls I absolutely love having
pearls on my outfits on my accessories
you guys know I have so many shoes and
bags things like that with pearls on but
this season it's also acceptable to have
them on your clothing so this is a skirt
that I picked up from coast and oh my
goodness Coast all I just actually
smashing it at the moment there is so
much in that that I'm obsessed with
right now this also works for sheer
trend it's got a tulle overlay but can
you imagine this on date night perhaps
with I keep saying it but a white
cashmere knit I will do the try on clip
with my favorite white knit at the
moment and you can see that it just goes
with absolutely everything once again if
you've got a baby shower or christening
or a spring party and engagement party
this is just such a gorgeous thing to
wear even if you've got perhaps your
prom coming up this with an embellished
top would look absolutely beautiful and
it does have these delicate little
pearls in there which make it so
on-trend at for spring some other
favorite pieces of mine with pearls on
include this dress from Ted Baker Ted
Baker always have the most beautiful
feminine designs and this is a really
gorgeous wearable way of adding pearls
to your more occasion wear outfits
you've got a cluster of pearls up here
on the neckline and then they go through
into the more flared out skirt as well
getting a little bit more sparse as we
go down this particular style of dress
where it's fitted on the bodice and then
flares out again I find super flattering
works on so many different body types
and just a fabulous ones having your
wardrobe for upcoming spring events if
you're looking to get that kind of trend
into your work wear wardrobe then this
is another piece from coast which is a
really great way of adding a very subtle
nod to the trend to your work wear it's
got beautiful it can you just take a
look at these sleeves they are so
stunning
it's got pleated detail which is always
on trend and then this pearl detail is
very very subtly underneath there oh my
goodness it really is spectacular you've
also got this pleated almost fluted hem
at the back here but at the end of the
day it is just a classic blouse just
with these most incredible detailed
sleeves it's a really fabulous and
wearable one from a coast
polka-dots is another trend that we're
going to be seeing a lot of in spring
and I've picked up these really low
lightweight trousers from Topshop once
again I've gone towards a more
affordable end of the high street for
trends and I'm still kind of umming and
ahhing about that's what I tend to do if
I'm not sure about something I'll pick
up some affordable pieces and then when
I know that that trend is something I'm
going to get a lot of wear out of that's
when I will invest I have a really good
example of that coming up next but these
I thought a really good fun for any
holidays I've got coming up they're
really lovely lightweight material
high-waisted trousers always super
flattering and a great way to experiment
with the Polka Dot trend at this spring
once I mentioned quite briefly because
I'm still a little bit unsure about it
but then when I saw this particular
garment I thought right that's what's
gonna make me try this trend and it is
power shorts yes you heard me right so
it is wearing shorts but in quite a
structured almost suit like way this is
a pair that I picked up from River
Island they are very short so I think
I'll probably experiment with this trend
on holiday on a beach holiday or
something but I thought these were a
really gorgeous material they have a
matching jacket which is very Baumann
asked so if you want to get the balm and
look for literally a fraction of the
price then that jacket I would highly
recommend but if you are excited for the
short trend then I think these are a
really really lovely way of injecting it
into your wardrobe now very affordable
these were let's see 28 pounds have
you're not sure if the trend is for you
then a very affordable way of giving it
a go I think this with a pair of
trainers or even my Nicholas Kirkwood
flats could be a really lovely way of
styling up the short trend for spring
and then last but absolutely not least
is a trend that I've already invested
quite heavily in and it is check print I
did an entire blogpost on why I'm loving
this trend so much so I'll leave that
one link down below but as you guys have
probably already seen if you've been
keeping up with my videos lately this is
my favorite check print piece at the
moment I didn't really get into the
check print trend in autumn there was
nothing that really suited my style but
this coat I have worn so much I'm
absolutely obsessed with it you can wear
the most plain outfit and then this
instantly makes your outfits so on-trend
once again can be worn over the
shoulders or with your arms through the
sleeves and then tied in at the middle
for a very feminine shape again it's one
from Reese so the tailoring the way that
it's been put together the way that it's
been cut is absolutely stunning I would
honestly highly highly recommend invest
in something like this if you can see
yourself wearing the check print all the
way throughout spring and you're looking
for a really statement outerwear piece
look no further this coat I absolutely
adore but then I've also picked up some
high street alternatives as well my
favorite from the high street is
probably this one from River Island this
is 85 pounds so more affordable than the
Reese one it is quite a thick woollen
material so it will be great while it's
still a little bit more chilly it's got
a very similar kind of boxy shape to the
Reese one and then as you can see really
wearable colors you've got this gray
white and black monochrome effect but
then a blush pink running through it so
no surprises why I absolutely love this
one even more of a masculine silhouette
but not too masculine color is this one
again from River Island this was again
85 pounds I think if you want things in
your wardrobe that are an instant outfit
wow you can wear this with plain jeans
and a white t-shirt your look is
instantly on trend or something like
this then this is a perfect way of doing
so and then a much more wearable one
this one is from Topshop this is a lot
more lightweight it doesn't have a
lining so when the temperatures do start
to rise you'll still be able to get away
with your check print trend with
something like this once again I think
this would be a really good one for work
it's a very smart
almost suit like material very smart
design details as well you've got this
tie effect on the sleeves beautiful big
lapels and so a great way to get the
check print trend into your wardrobe if
check print outerwear is just a little
bit too much then I also saw these
gorgeous trousers from Topshop what made
me pick up these was firstly they're
super stretchy so very very comfortable
but they also look really smart the
check print trend what I love about it
is that it instantly smart ins up any
look but it's also very feminine this
has got a ruffle detail just underneath
the hem very very subtle hopefully the
camera is picking that up so if you feel
like something like this could be a
little bit too masculine if your style
is a bit like mine then these are a
really nice way of adding a feminine
touch to what could be quite a masculine
trend so those are my top spring trends
I really hope you guys enjoyed looking
through these pieces with me let me know

spring trends you're most excited about

these pieces or if there are any other
