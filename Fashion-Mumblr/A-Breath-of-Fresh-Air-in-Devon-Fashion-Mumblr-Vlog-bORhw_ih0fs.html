vlog I thought I would vlog for today
and tomorrow as one big vlog because
it's gonna be a really exciting and fun
couple of days I'm actually in Devon in
a place called yo town with the skincare
company philosophy and we are here to
celebrate or to learn about one of their
new launches and we don't really know
too much about it yet but that's why
we're here basically and we've just
taken the train from London here to I
think I train so it was called Tiverton
I've not really been to this area before
so it's all pretty new to me and we've
just had our bags dropped off and
checked into our rooms and this room is
just absolutely stunning so before I do
anything else I'm just going to give you
a very quick room tour it's pretty much
just one big room and a lovely bathroom
so not too much of a tour but let me
flip the car around and show you so this
absolute spectacle this stunning room
here is my bedroom for the night the
trip itself is actually two nights but
sadly I've got to leave after one night
which is such a shame because it looks
so cozy I've got a little desk situation
going on here uploading a video as we
speak
I've been trying to get Wi-Fi all
morning but it seems to be working then
I've got a little wardrobe area there's
my suitcase I just can't believe how
stunning this is it's so beautiful and
there's a little window through here
we've got the bathroom
look at this it's just so stunning
beautiful floor detail like all these
wooden ships got some products there
beautiful bathroom look at this and then
here we have some bits and bobs from
philosophy it's my reflection hello so
this is let's have a look micro delivery
resurfacing peel that looks interesting
with vitamin C and microdermabrasion
crystals very interesting so I'll be
giving that a try out later and then
we've got their purity shower gel I
think I know this
a three-in-one cleanser very nice oh
wait I think I have this at home pretty
sure I do very very lovely product this
is a very tempting looking bath and then
also some products in the windows so
we've got the pure grace range
I've definitely featured the fragrance
before and then we've got shower gel
body lotion I'm guessing this is some
bath soul so absolutely beautiful room
here at yo town is so blissful to get
out of the city I've been really lucky
recently with this and then the
Cotswolds so her farmhouse is just just
what I needed helped a fashion week so
I'm very very thankful to be here I'm
gonna do a very quick unpack and get
change because then we're gonna go and
have lunch together into our hiking gear
and we're gonna go our nice long hike so
I'm gonna get changed I'll see you in a
few minutes
all right so it just has a really lovely
organic lunch and the lovely Mercedes
and Simon were explaining how all the
food that we're eating is pretty much
organic and sourced locally River food
is their local place to get the lovely
organic food they do grow a lot of it
here as well and we've had a little
orientation and briefing from the gang
that are going to be taking us on a walk
and it sounds pretty serious we've had
the full lowdown about dehydration about
blisters about what to do with our
toenails and how to not make them fall
off it's so pretty pretty intense stuff
so I've just come to the room and I've
got changed because I felt like my
outfit before was not good enough for
hiking so I got my sweaty Betty yoga
jumper on I've got my jacket on and then
my EMU hiking boots which I wore in in
morresy luckily so we're gonna hop in
the van now and go for a lovely scenic
hike
so we've just done a little photo shoot
over on the pinnacle over there and now
we're going to tackle 17 oh it's cool
this big bold white seed shake that
booty
it's got back to our rooms after our
lovely walk and I feel like I can
actually really appreciate how amazing
this room is now it's obviously I was a
little bit rushed before I've just
opened up the goodie bag that was on my
bed and inside I wish I'd seen this
earlier I would have taken it with me
I've got this gorgeous personalized
water bottle and it's got one of these
infuser things in it so you can put
fruit in that middle section makes it
taste a little bit nicer and then also
something from slogan fit so let's have
a little look what's in here so we have
got inhale-exhale this is a yoga table
by the looks of it which is actually
really handy because I did not bring a
yoga top I bought leggings but no tops
I'll be sticking this on for our yoga
session and then also I didn't really
show you here but this is the reason why
we're here so we've got take a deep
breath this is an oil-free oxygenating
gel cream I don't really know much about
this yet but I think we're going to get
told before we go in to our yoga session
and then they've also got the
oxygenating eye cream so that's how look
natural blend of antioxidants and Antipa
Lutins
so I guess we're getting like a major
hit about being out here in beautiful
Devon and then I didn't show you this
properly either but on the mirror
we've got Josie take a deep breath
philosophy you see life more clearly
when you take a moment to breathe deep
breath
so we are feeling totally banned out and
chilled after I do gir session I'm
really starting to get into this yogurt
gels I need to find somewhere good near
me and clapping anyone knows anywhere
let me know and ya come into the main
house now smell good we're all packaged
and we're just checking out on chillin
out in the lounge room this whole place
is just like tree to get over home
having a nice little relaxing session
and yeah fire is flowing away behind me
well I am very relieved that my camera
is working because I just felt pretty
much an entire bottle of water in my bag
I think I was just totally zoned out
after that massage so yeah back in the
room now I just had the most incredible
massage it was kind of like a relaxing
oil deep tissue massage the lady managed
to pummel all the knots out of my
shoulders and my bum cheeks who knew
that my bum cheeks for that naughty and
but yeah I definitely fell asleep a few
times I'm looking a little bit scary now
or makeup-less
and oily but I'm going to continue with
a bit of pampering I'm just running the
bath the bath here it looks insanely
good so yeah just running a bath and I
think I might pamper myself with a few
of the philosophy products I'm gonna use
the cleanser and maybe try out the peel
as well and then I'm pretty much just
gonna get into bed so nothing too
exciting to report so yeah I will see
you guys in the morning and we're going
to be getting up at 7:15 for yoga and
then a nice healthy breakfast and I
think we're going on a bike ride so
another really lovely active and healthy
day tomorrow so a good night for me I
hope you enjoyed watching today's vlog
and I shall see you in the morning
good morning it is day 2 in yo town and
it is currently about 8 o'clock in the
morning we just had a lovely yoga
session to start the day
really really nice breathing exercises
getting blood oxygen in our body and now
I'm going into the kitchen to have a
lovely and healthy breakfast and then I
think in about 45 minutes for bike rides
for three nights
looking very snazzy rocking the bikers
helmet Emily and I by far the best
bikers don't work oh my god we're miles
ahead of everybody psyche but don't even
hear yeah I mean what is going on with
these guys yeah you've been biking for
about half an hour now and we've just
stopped by a beautiful viaduct taking in
the fresh air having a wonderful day
so back at yo town now after our
intensive cycle we were probably going
for about 22 kilometers I think that's
what most said it a little bit so we're
feeling fairly peckish we've definitely
worked up an appetite and as you can see
what all gather around the table got our
lunch front of us got very healthy
looking and he would got like lentils
corn on the cob and a corn muffin
potentially so we've had lunch and it
was absolutely delicious as you guys saw
and Daisy and I have just been taking
some photos in my room for my blog post
I'm definitely gonna write a post all
about the product which philosophy have
launched here and I've also just
realized I haven't really told you guys
what the products are all about but
basically they're launching a face cream
and an eye cream which focus on the
benefits of oxygen for the skin so
obviously our bodies need oxygen like
that how we breathe but also oxygen has
really good regeneration effects for the
skin so it's great for collagen and all
the ingredients that us Millennials need
our skin to keep it looking plump and
youthful and kind of the benefits that
you get from being out in the
countryside that we don't really get in
the city so another really important
factor about it is that it's got
anti-pollution benefits so really good
for girls like you and me our age living
in the city or living in the countryside
because you can never really have too
much oxygen so yeah there's a lovely day
cream I also use it as a night cream
last night and a very light eye cream
two in the collection but we just took
some nice photos I will be doing a blog
post about it very soon so if that's
live by the time this video goes live
honey unlikely but if you're watching
this a few weeks after it goes live then
I'll leave it linked down below and we
are now I thought you're wearing the
same leggings with me other okay Emily's
just come to join in the partay so I
have you been doing in your free time
darling vibes honestly I wear Baxter I
do some work so I just ended up lying on
the bed so we're now going to make some
I think I'm making like protein protein
balls and then sadly I've got to go home
if I'm going to Germany tomorrow I would
rather be here yeah so sadly I'm leaving
a day early and these girlies get to
stay and relax a little bit further but
I'm going to go to Germany for a talk at
a photo conference so that's going to be
wonderful
anyway let's go make some protein balls
