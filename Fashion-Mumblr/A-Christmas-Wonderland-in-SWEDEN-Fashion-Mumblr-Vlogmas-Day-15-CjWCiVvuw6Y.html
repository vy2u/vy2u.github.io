good morning then but it's not the
morning it's actually about 5:00 p.m. I
did start this vlog at 5:00 a.m. this
morning before we left home but I just
watched it back and I looked so
revolting the title I would just start
it again um so yeah we are in Sweden
today I showed you guys a little bit of
the getting here part of it we flew out
this morning from Gatwick
there was a train strike so we had to
get a cab and it was all a little bit
stressful but we made it we flew
Norwegian to Gothenburg and it was
amazing because we had Wi-Fi on the
airplane which just was very wonderful
to me um yeah so we arrived in
Gothenburg this afternoon and the reason
why I didn't vlog on my camera before
now was because disorganized Josie over
here only bought one memory card with me
and I had to leave that memory card in
my laptop to upload the vlogmas that you
guys watched yesterday so I didn't have
a memory card in my camera when we
walked around town so sorry about that
but don't worry because I'm going to be
walking around Gothenburg town tomorrow
as well and the only thing that you
really missed was me getting a really
good coffee from a place called de
Matteo which apparently is the best
coffee in Sweden so that was wonderful
I now kind of have coffee shakes don't
if you can tell by my slightly weird
Heitor voice but yeah too much coffee so
we are in our hotel right now we've been
here for the past couple of hours after
our little x-play exploration around
town and we've just been doing a little
bit of work we're staying at the
aquarium post hotel which is in the
centre of Gothenburg we're here for just
one night while we explore the city and
the hotel is really cool I'll show you
around a little bit when we go
downstairs in the second it used to be
the old post office or sorting office
here in Gothenburg and
yeah really cool old building I will
give you a little tour in a second just
about to put on a few more layers it's
quite chilly here and we're gonna have a
really fun evening so I thought I would
pick up the vlog again we're basically
going to a place called I think it's
called Lisa Berg and it's almost like a
permanent winter wonderland but better
so they have rollercoasters they have a
ferris wheel they have a really lovely
Christmas market we're going to watch
their Nutcracker on ice and have a
lovely dinner and go to some Christmas
markets so it's gonna be a really lovely
festive evening so instead of seeing
what we're doing in the day you're gonna
see what we're doing in the evening I
feel like I really fit in in Sweden with
my new hair colour it's just so much
blonder than I've had it before I just
love it more and more every time I look
in the mirror so if you guys didn't see
yesterday's vlog of me getting my hair
colored then it's more exciting than it
sounds I promise then I'll leave that
one linked down below so yeah we are
just gonna put some more clothes on and
head out so I'll catch you in a few
moments
very next day you gave it
we have arrived at Liseberg and it is
officially the most Christmasy place I
have ever been to visit you darling yeah
walking through the entrance area and
it's this little Avenue lined with fur
covered trees all the houses around us
the covered in Christmas light there is
a massive ferris wheel up behind nurse
this place first wins one land shame
it's like kind of like a permanent theme
park that's Christmas themed I can't
believe I didn't know this was here as
humongous lover of Christmas you'd have
thought I learn about this place but no
it's just a sea magical also there's a
little look around
oh my gosh
oh my goodness
this is a Christmas oh my gosh go for
rides
this is literally a Christmas theme park
you've got a lazy river here with all
twinkly lights all around the river and
then everyone's floating around and
these little like sparkly baubles
let's go pointing me I guess that was a
shoulder to cry on but if there's no
real owner
Oh
yeah
Christmas
oh my goodness
this place is just absolutely insane I
would describe this as like a mash-up
between winter wonderland
ballpark and like Vista village because
I mean look at all these little
buildings all around me
yeah and Disneyland so all these little
Sally don't you think all of these
places like no shops thanks Tom for that
Chalet of that is actually a Burger King
but they disguised it like Riku person
see house all around us are Christmas
trees with a sparkly fairy lights we
just walked through like eight children
from wonderland or these little theme
park rides like teacups and mini roller
coasters when I have children I am
definitely going to bring them here at
Christmas this is literally the most
offensive place I've ever been
I think we've now got two slightly more
adult area and there's some shops some
food places and Charlie's desperate for
a burger so we're gonna try to find him
one
all I keep thinking is how long you must
have taken someone to cover these trees
in fairy lights and every single tree is
just covered it up like someone has
spent hours and hours and hours
wrapping every single branch in fairy
lights
you suffer Merry Christmas
so we've been in the games arcade we've
lost all of our pennies and we've been
through the main like rollercoaster area
and now we found ourselves in like a
middle-aged village they're selling faux
fur things swords grenades all that kind
of thing Nick do you tie game
Oh
here we are as in olden days happy
golden days of yore faithful Friends who
are dear to us gather near to us once
more the key is we all will be together
if the fates allow hang a shining star
upon the highest
a merry little Christmas
so we just had a delicious dinner at a
restaurant called of mr. P's mr. P mr. P
or mr. P's
mr. P which is within the Art Museum in
Gothenburg which is this building here
behind me very very beautiful building I
think we might check out the actual art
museum tomorrow now we've just found
ourselves in this ginormous square it's
been lights going on and over the place
is like like an ice-skating rink and
without the ice very very strange so
heading back to the hotel now for a
fairly early night is absolutely
freezing I'm so excited to bundle up in
a duvet and as it's not too late night
watch film have a bit of a pamper and
probably get a little bit work done too
back in the hotel now and Charlie and I
are gonna have an early night going to
watch some governance stage are we
darling
whatever's on Netflix so I'm gonna take
my makeup off I went to boots in the
airport I'll show you what I got so I
got this is Charles Worthington color
enhancer violet shampoo takeaway so I
picked this one up because obviously I
just had my hair bleached and I would
rather like it to say this color so I
bought this in the hope that it all kind
of neutralized my hair then I got a mini
micellar water this is just the Garnier
micellar cleansing water and I do have
some cotton pads with me in here so
that's how I will take off my makeup and
this is only a pound which I thought was
really good
also got an eyebrow pencil I seem to
have lost like all my eyebrow pencils at
the moment this is I don't know why only
their reflection is in focus this is the
Rimmel London professional eyebrow
pencil mini batiste dry shampoo because
I'm very lazy and I don't really like
washing my hair and I'm on holiday so I
thought I'd get that and also to help
avoid hats hair which I have at the
moment and finally I got the boots I
think this is boots own brand tea tree
and witch hazel peel off a face mask
I used to use these quite a lot when I
was younger and just find the most
satisfying thing in the whole world to
peel off so I'm going to take my makeup
off
stick this on and then peel all
crap of muskan so this is definitely not
a good look
I know talk about some weird plastics
and stuff going on but I'm very excited
to peel this off let's see hello I
definitely put on to take on air this is
my American Psycho moment the ultimate
goal is to get it all up in one didn't
quite manage it but my skin feels lovely
and smooth and I don't think you may
even need to wash outdoors cuz nothing
left on that that was fun I'm gonna
finish off today's vlog and carry on
watching how yeah so I'm going to finish
the blog here and carry on watching How
to Lose a Guy in 10 days Charlie
actually chose that film setting man
that says something about him so I'll
see you guys in the morning thanks
