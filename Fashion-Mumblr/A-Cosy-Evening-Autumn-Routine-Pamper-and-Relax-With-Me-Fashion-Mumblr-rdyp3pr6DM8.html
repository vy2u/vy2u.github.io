well and snuggled up with a hot cup of
tea for this evening this video which is
going to be my cozy evening routine
arriving home after a day of work it's
time for an evening of relaxing and
unwinding a bit of pampering to
as soon as I'm in the house it's off
with my boots and into the bedroom where
I get into my dressing-gown to be super
snuggly and cozy for the evening ahead
these
at this time of year I'm trying to ward
off any potential coals so in the
mornings and evenings I like to enjoy a
hot mug of lemon and ginger tea as well
as being great for relaxing and
recharging the active ingredients in the
ginger helped to fight bacterial
infections and you also get the immune
boosting benefits from the lemon too and
it tastes rather lovely then it's back
upstairs and into the bathroom where my
pampering begins I literally live for
the moment I can take my makeup off and
almost always I use Liz Earl's cleanse
and polish it removes every trace of
makeup and the formula just eases any
problems my skin might be experiencing
and you get a gentle exfoliation when
you buff off with a warm cloth
then I reach for the sugar face
punishment fresh the brown sugar
particles naturally seal in moisture as
well as gently buffing away any dull
skin and other ingredients include wild
strawberry packed with vitamin C to
brighten the skin
I find it leaves my complexion
beautifully rationed
I'm massage it in gently exfoliating and
then leave it on the skin for about five
to ten minutes while I prepare my bath
back in the bathroom I give my skin one
last massage before using a hot towel to
remove and then it's on to mask number
two also from fraiche this is the
vitamin nectar mask with a citrus blend
and vitamin fruit complex but also very
gently exfoliates but also gives the
skin a boost of vitamin C II and before
giving clarity and brightness to the
complexion
while this works it's magic I'm adding
the bubbles I'm making the most of cow
shed products here at Soho farmhouse and
adding in my favorite bath oil from
aromatherapy associates it smells so
good and will make your whole house
smell incredible long after your bath
time has ended
bath time is strictly a no technology
time I lie back relax stretch my legs it
would appear and then I reach for a
magazine trying to find something
readable invoke other than an advert and
just zone out for 20 minutes or so while
my muscles and mind relax once I'm ready
to clean myself out of the bath I towel
off and apply the origins ginger souffle
body lotion all over it smells divine
then the origins ginseng moisturizer for
my face we have a real vitamin trend
going on this evening this is another
great smelling skincare treat that
boosts my skin with vitamin C and a kick
of caffeine too here's one of my autumn
skincare tips I add a few drops of the
Clarins the golden glow booster to my
face and body moisturizer which helps me
to maintain my tan and that healthy glow
in the cooler months time for more
relaxing is back into my dressing gown
and time to wind down with some laptop
time my final boost of vitamins this
evening comes from my water might get me
vitamin D water gives me the boost of
the vitamin D so
need at this time I'm here helping you
maintain healthy teeth bones and muscles
and it tastes amazing too
just before bed I apply the Clinique
pout restoring night mask this stuff
really is incredible leaving my lips are
so soft and blunt and then to help us
unwind and sleep well I spritz the
pillows with the nails yard remedies
goodnight hello mist finally my evening
skin care which as always consists of
Estee Lauder's advanced night repair
this one is their charity pink edition
bottle which is so beautiful and 20% of
the price it goes to the Breast Cancer
Research Foundation
finally the LMS dynamic resurfacing
night cream which helps to stimulate the
skin's natural cell renewal process
great for clarifying the skin and
fighting against any fine lines dullness
and even the effects of pollution
skincare routine complete and it's into
bed and lights out I hope you enjoyed
tonight's video and I'll see you in the
next one
good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
