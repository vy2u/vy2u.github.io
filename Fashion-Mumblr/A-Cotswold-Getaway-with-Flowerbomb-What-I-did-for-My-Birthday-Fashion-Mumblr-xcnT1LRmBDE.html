it go - welcome to a new vlog I thought
I would film these next couple of days
because I'm on a blog a trip with Viktor
and Rolf and it's already so dreamy and
I just wanted to save all these moments
and share them with you so we've arrived
at a beautiful Cotswolds boutique hotel
called time and we just come up to our
rooms as you saw we had an amazing
champagne arrival there's a very
Instagram wall pink bike outside it is
gonna be stunning so I wanted to show
you around and let you experience it
with us and so this is my incredible
room it looks so beautiful so cozy there
was a little goodie box on the bed from
Viktor and Rolf and he's very in store
on balloons which I'll definitely be
snapping with outside shortly a bath
which I'm very excited to use later on
today and yeah it's just so lovely so
cozy have a little look in the bathroom
beautiful natural light so so nice we
actually have a photographer staying
with us that we can use while we're here
so I'm gonna put on a nice outfit throw
out my hair and makeup and then do some
fluffing so after settling in and
unpacking a little we have just done a
little mini photo shoot I have finally
been United with this whom you may
recognize from many a fabulous Instagram
photo car and I wanted to shoot together
for our 3rd on we finally been united
he's currently setting up a very smelly
flash set up in the bedroom because as
you know I like my photos to be nice and
bright and fresh and I was a bit worried
that this room is a bit dark but he
assures me it's going to look a
brilliant I'm very excited to see what
they look like we've just shot this
outfit
in this
I just had a scrumptious lunch very
farmhouse style of cheese love spreads
with my favorite things and now we might
win again we both really need selfish
out PGM oh we're about to decorate
Christmas trees with flower bomb
decoration rumors
we can't
spent the last 20 minutes wrapping up
some gifts which we chose for our
friends earlier and now they look so
beautiful this is how your flower bomb
will come wrapped up if you go to store
and buy it as a gift this Christmas so
they just look absolutely adorable but
the bows on inside you've got the boxes
and then inside the boxes obviously the
tissue paper and the fragrance so so
lovely I would love to find that under
my tradition making our Christmas trees
or decorating on trees and wrapping up
our gifts you just come back to our room
and Viktor and Rolf have left us a few
more prezis which I thought I would open
up with you I didn't show you what was
in the Box on the bed before the bed is
scattered with all of these beautiful
flowers but let's have a look inside
these amazing goodie boxes so inside
this one which I've already already had
a peek in we have a selection of my
favorites Viktor and Rolf products so
this is the victim Rolf candle a flower
bomb candle you've probably heard me
talking about this already because I'm
in love with it so much definitely if
you're fan of the fragrance pop this
under the tree then I'm not sure this is
I think it might be a very luxurious
flower bomb so and then this is the body
lotion which is so so beautiful also
comes in a big glass version too and of
course the classic fragrance my favorite
perfume ever I just love it so much all
of my friends whenever they smell flower
bond they always say it reminds some of
me it's just what I've worn for so many
years and then it looks like you have a
lovely little canister of matches too so
I can light my candle later on then we
have this new bag that's been delivered
beautifully wrapped up what have we got
inside I think this might be the gift
set gosh we're so lucky
so this oh my gosh this one is available
at the perfume shop it's this beautiful
bottle with this gorgeous big flower
kind of like a rosette on it
just such a beautiful beautiful
Christmas gift and then I've got a card
my name on it and some ladies
so cute I'll quickly try and show you
what I'm wearing now as well so I've got
my usual Club Monaco juillet on which
I've been wearing so much lately
and then this knitwear piece is from
Jack Wills I find it this time of year
Jack Wills have so many comfy knit
pieces that I just adore and then I've
got on my River Island suede leggings
which are my favorite pieces and my
Karen Millen boots I have also been
using my Aspinall handbag today it's

[Laughter]
okay bye
few hours later and I'm now home again
after a wonderful couple of days in the
Cotswolds with Flowerbomb Viktor and
Rolf is such a perfect way to begin our
festivities of the year and with my
favorite fragrance company I have just
seen our walking wardrobe for the very
first time I'll be doing a proper video
all about building it and filling it
with all of my clothes I'm probably
gonna film a lot of that tomorrow so
check that out when it's live but little
sneak peek very very exciting I'm gonna
wrap this up for today because I've got
a lot of vlog AM L to unbox and shall we
doing my Instagram stories so I will see
you in the morning
hey guys so it is the next day now it is
Friday the 24th of November which means
it's Mother's Day today I've spent the
whole day at home I have actually been
doing quite a bit of work today it's
Black Friday which means I've had to
just get a load of content done I filmed
a whole video I did a blog post and I've
just been trying to find really good
deals so it's been quite busy for that
reason and then I have been sorting out
this room because it was a bomb site I
had so many deliveries I didn't in
surround live last night for opening up
my blogger Mel which a lot of you really
liked and so if you missed my blogger
mail hauls on YouTube and definitely
check out my Instagram because I think I
might do a few more lives as it went
down so well one of the most amazing
things was a pasture parcel from benefit
and it included things like a benefit
towel and their full size of their
professional they're like blotting
powder what else is in there loads of
their amazing brow products and they'd
also sent a blog a melon boxing kit
which had like a Stanley knife in it and
recycling bags they are just so on it so
thank you benefits and what else was
there an amazing gift from Swarovski
which was this beautiful set of
Swarovski Christmas tree baubles and
they're just so stunning so yeah very
busy day in boxing blogger Mel one of
the things that arrived and that I
wanted to open with you in this video is
this this is the I think it's the
L'Oreal luxe advent calendar this
arrived sadly too late
for me to include in my advent calendar
videos I'm not planning on doing a third
one but I really wanted to open this
with you because it's so stunning it's
available at Boots it is 95 pounds but I
think it is worth yeah worth over 200
pounds you're getting double the value
in here L'Oreal obviously well probably
not maybe not obviously they own so many
brands it's not just like lore'l l vivre
and L'Oreal Paris for the makeup there
are brands like Lancome Yves and Iran
although I have a feeling that might be
changing so I think the designer took it
back in-house don't quote me on why I
sell so many brands of which many are in
this Advent canvas it's really nice mix
it says on the back there's some mini
flower bon perfumes there's a wide sell
primer loads of Lancome in here
absolutely loads and loads a blank on
which is great because I absolutely love
Lancome it's mostly Lancome wild flower
bomb but it looks a bit so I thought I'd
open up a few days because I know you
guys love opening advent calendars with
me this one it looks like this is a
total first impression so I've not like
look to this yet so I'm opening up this
little ribbon and it looks like we have
some drawers inside oh look how
beautiful this is stunning oh my
goodness that is absolutely something
Wow where she starts you looking inside
number 12 something from YSL this is
this is that brand new mascara this is
called the shock and it's a two mil so
it's not too tiny it's a really good
kind of handbag size one I absolutely
love having this size in the makeup bag
that I keep in my handbag in the gym bag
as well and that is a very good mascara
I have tried that before and it's an
excellent one so that will come in
extremely handy I'm looking inside door
number 10 and it's my favorite little
perfume this is a mini of the victim
role flower bomb this actually will last
you a long time I had one of these in my
holiday travel bag and it lasted me like
10 trips I would dab it quite generously
on my spot so my breast on my neck and
because it's a Python
the scent is just really really strong
so that is an amazing little gift behind
or
Hemme let's look behind door number nine
oh this looks like a pretty big one that
is a very generous size Oh I've not
tried this this is from Lancome it is
there lay Charlotte a comfort comforting
makeup remover milk with honey oh my
gosh honey and sweet almond oil that
sounds like my dream a combination
sounds like my dream for it so I'm very
much looking forward to opening up day
number nine I hope I'm not spoiling it
for you if anybody already has this and
finally cuz I normally only open three
when I'm unboxing my having countless
but I'm gonna open up door number three
as well this again looks like a really
great size product Wow this is their
Lancome again beauty sleep Perfector
advanced multi correcting and gel-in-oil
so i guess this is a night cream this is
a really nice way of trying out what is
a fairly high price point product from
lancome it's definitely enough product
in here that will give you an idea as to
whether it really works your skin so
perhaps you might want to invest in the
full-size of this but that is yeah a
very very generous size for a luxury
product within an advent calendar so
this one most definitely has my seal of
approval I will very much look forward
to opening this one it throughout
Christmas what a beautiful calendar that
is absolutely stunning look lovely on my
mantelpiece as well so I am now just
waiting for my mum to get here going out
for dinner this evening with Charlie as
well and I'm also popping in to the Tom
Ford store launch or store opening in
common garden they're opening a new
boutique which should be really
beautiful I'm going to nip in there as
well and I think we're gonna brave
Oxford Street as I said it is Black
Friday but my mum really wants to try on
some frames some like spectacles so
we're gonna brave that or maybe there'll
be some opticians in calm garden we can
nip into anyway I will catch up with you
a little bit later on my head
out of the house because I have a little
bit more tidying to do and a little bit
more work to do before my mum comes so
I'll catch up with you in a short water
we have a slight change of plan for this
evening due to the incident at Oxford
Circus we're no longer going to go into
central London tonight we're going to
stay around where we live here in
southwest London and luckily luckily we
have a really nice steak restaurant just
down the road from our house it's about
five minutes away so we are going to
that instead I'm going to show you a
very quick outfit of the evening
quite casual but we're only going to be
out for an hour and a half so this is my
outfit of the night I'm wearing quite a
lot of new pieces
so first of all I'll show you the coats
obviously have just got it drapes at the
moment but this is my new one from the
Ted Baker Black Friday sale it was 30%
off so that's what I'm wearing over the
top the next layer is this jumper and
it's got this really nice button detail
which i think is really lovely this
would be a really good like layering
piece for a pre ski perhaps but yeah
just really loving slightly more premium
looking knitwear at the moment and this
one I thought was very nice it's got the
buttons on both sides I have of course
got a thermal on underneath that then I
have got my gray suede leggings on these
are from River Island and my Stuart
Weitzman boots which are quite hard to
show you in at the wardrobe but yeah
these my black over knee Stuart Weitzman
boots I think I'm also gonna take my
little Chloe bracelet back with me this
one is just a very special little number
so a nice one for my bed
let it go to
we found
