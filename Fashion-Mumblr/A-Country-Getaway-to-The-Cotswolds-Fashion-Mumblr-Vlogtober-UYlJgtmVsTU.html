vlog tobert today as you can see I'm not
in London which just warms my heart I am
back at Soho farmhouse which is swiftly
becoming one of my favorite places I
actually got an invitation just a couple
of days ago to come out here with Danone
who make a light and free yogurts and I
just could not turn down an opportunity
to get out of the city so here we are
and we're actually about to start making
some lunch we've got some ingredients
laid out in front of us and we've just
got some smoothies for breakfast we
drove down from London earlier this
morning and I was just too much of a
zombie to start blogging that early so
it's only about half past 10:00 now so
you've got a full day here and yeah
really excited to be getting some fresh
air and just be in this beautiful
beautiful place so I'm gonna get back
into the kitchen and we're gonna start
cooking
so this is the first thing that we're
going to make him today it's people's
baby features so we've got the
instructions on front of us and the
ingredients so
simmering away
we've had our delicious and healthy
lunch which you made ourselves always
makes it 200 times more satisfying and
now we've got a little bit free time to
explore the farmhouse I think we're
going to go down to the lake do a little
bit of rowing in this place is literally
the most beautiful place of photos so
going to the wind around and take some
snaps
okay so it made our way to the lakes and
Rosie and I are about to attempt going
in the boat how do you remember these
hopefully 90s
I was pretty impressed with our still
sailing skills program
so in taking some photos in the
courtyard which basically goes against
everything that's there are stun Spore
but hey ho we haven't been told off yet
and now we're gonna go to the shop I've
just bought some rosy apples and rosie
has bought a bag of chicken mixture
hey guys so I'm back home again now as
you can probably tell from my
surroundings and we had such a fabulous
day at the Soho farmhouse just so so so
nice to escape from the city I'm really
loving these days out and it's so
attainable in one day like it took us
maybe an hour and a half to get there
and an hour and a half to get back so
really not that bad actually like
definitely commutable my argument for
moving to the countryside just gets
bigger and bigger every single day but
yeah so back home now I thought I would
just quickly show you what we got in our
lovely goodie bags from the events I
also bought home a few flowers not sure
if you spotted these in the background
in the video earlier when we were
preparing some food but they were just
so stunning and then at the end they
were like to take some flowers and of
course being vloggers we all said yes so
you'll be seeing those in some vlog
photos very very soon and yeah we also
have a little goodie bag so let's have a
look inside I haven't even looked in it
myself
this bag smells like bonfires I lent it
up against the bonfire while we were
grabbing cocktails so it just smells
really autumnal and that smell reminds
me of my birthday as well because once
you start smelling bonfires it means
it's nearly like bad day so yes we have
the kinfolk table book this was in our
little goodie bag and I was actually
gonna get this charlie for Christmas so
I might hide this or is that really
cheeky I can't give them something that
I've been given free can I know maybe
I've just presented to him but this is a
cookbook and and it's recipes for small
gatherings apparently so I will be
having a look in that later also in here
we have of course some light and free
yogurt because that's who kindly took us
out to Soho farm house today this is the
chair
Charma flavor and you guys saw a clip of
our dessert and that was that mixed with
cream I believe with some nuts and a
compote in it and oh my gosh that was so
tasty I'm definitely going recreating
that for some dinner parties because
people will think that I'm amazing a
making dessert and actually it's just
yogurt with a few extra ingredients so
love that oh we have some Soho farmhouse
produce farmhouse honey in this gorgeous
little kiln a jar and something else
from the farmhouse ah this is the
compote so maybe I can make it for
dinner tomorrow or even tonight I'm
still hungry so that's some lovely
goodies that we got to take home with us
um next on my agenda this evening oh my
god did you see me just jumps and
because I caught the guy cuz I got the
camera strap out the corner of my eye
and I thought it was someone coming into
the house that really scared me so next
on the agenda tonight is a bath I'm
gonna run the bath and wash my hair have
a bit of a chill out and then I think
once I'm a little bit more chilled I'm
gonna have a cup of chamomile tea as
well just totally chill me out not that
today's been stressful but you know I'm
just quite a stressful person so I do
need chilling out and I'm gonna have
both and then I'm gonna crack on with a
little bit of work I've got videos to
edit blog posts to write emails to
answer so chill out first and then do a
little bit of work before Charlie gets
home from a Yorker he should be back
hopefully at around 10 o'clock tonight
so time to get sprucing okay I am ready
for my pamper session to begin I've put
on a couple more of these L'Oreal clay
face masks can't really move my jaw that
much I've gotten to the purifying one
and the glowing one which is the brown
one I haven't used the brown one quite
as much so basically trying to use it up
and see if it works see if it gives me a
glow I've got my pucker
rose chamomile and lavender tea which is
just a really relaxing one and then I'm
gonna take a copy of L into the bath
with me and I don't really like Elle but
it came with my look fantastic beauty
box I just don't find it that
interesting but I'm gonna see if I can
find something to flick
while I'm in the bath and then let me
show you what I'm gonna be pampering
myself with so I've had this in my
bathroom for quite some time and I've
not used it yet it's the aroma therapy
associates clear mind bath and shower
oils that sounds rather lovely luxurious
and then I'm going to use a L'Oreal
color correcting shampoo and deep
conditioner that's the vit amino color
ao X range so I'm going to use the
shampoo and conditioner from that and
then I'm just about gonna finish off my
fiery pink pepper molten Brown and body
polisher this is nearly empty so I'm
going to finish that one off as well
these are some bath crystals which I'm
going to put in as well from this brand
I'm not too sure how to say it neat
potentially and but these are amazing
this Sun of eucalyptus and they're
really good for carrying out your system
I don't really feel like I've got a cold
but this will hopefully just invigorate
me a little bit more
we've got and I'm in bed and it's only
half past nine I'm gonna do a little bit
of work I think maybe edit a video
upload that and then I think I'm just
gonna chill for a little bit Charlie
should be home in just over an hour
hopefully he's just text me What did he
say
on the train now oh good home just
before 10:30 so not too long to wait
until chai gets home so ya gonna do a
little bit of work and then just watch
some YouTube videos and relax so I hope
