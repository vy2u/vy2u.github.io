Charlie and I have completed what I
think has been the world's toughest
personal training session you think our
success later yeah I think I think that
one was just intense that there was zero
zero right yeah so it was continuous
exercise for 45 minutes
oh my goodness Adam absolutely blitz us
and what you guys just saw what I filmed
was actually our last circuit hey we did
doing very probably not being on top
form but yeah that was really really
tough something another daily vlog today
I'm going to be showing you a kind of
healthy day kicking it off with on my
actors eyes yeah we make sleeping at
home kicking off with some exercises
that for our heart rates up then tons of
calories and because they were so high
intensity we're going to continue
burning calories
I've been several pretty burnin
according to calorie the key a key thing
with a high-intensity workout like that
is you burn more calories a short period
of time that be your body temperature
and your heart rate is up throughout the
day and you will a bit like 20 minute I
can actually hold this camera anyone
come out on drilling wait a minute to
sprint verses a 5k run 20 minutes
experience where you lose more weight
and you'll actually benefit from it more
in the long run
yeah electric training for something
like a mat so just going to nip to the
post often pick up the mail and I'll see
you at home to make a nice healthy juice
okay well back home again today is going
to be a day of lots of kind of house
chores and all that glamorous side of
things
washing sits on the outside first wall
that I'm going to make a smoothie like a
breakfast community and charlie is going
to make a juice we went to the farmers
market from Saturday luckily we have one
here in Clapham lot easier by like
organic food so we're going to use as
much of that as well but we have also
swim to say no to talk up on the
universities so I'll show you what
Charlie puts in his juices which he
tends to make you say like three days
worth and they're in a go
I recognize it's quite a week which is
nothing three days maybe two or three
days Voicebox yeah and then I normally
just make a breakfast smoothie after gym
session fills me up a little bit sugary
but it tastes good and it's a lot
healthier than my normal kind of yogurt
breakfast so let's do it
like um um anything took google day
we've got one orange and one Apple which
will give it some sweetness remember
this is probably enough at least two or
three mornings for two people
the only like real sugar that's can be
another creature has natural sugar but
seems like a lot be true but this is
just one thing of four beetroot cart and
B trees obviously amazing for those
reasons that is really good for skin
those sufferings will give your blood
cucumber
our cucumber not separate from cucumber
even natural diuretic so it's like a
good for like helping super but it's a
little also like really high and waters
is like good hydrator
yeah so and it also gives a nice flavors
produced which is just generally very
good with other tool is real and it
means ginger which is naturally
antibacterial so it's quite good if
you've got sore throat it's a very
flippin with the color right yeah i
lemon which because of its so then it
gets right actually very people think
like as if actually like and how they
help one so balances your body pH and
then point on that I'm pretty sure and
then we've got some celery and you know
I often just stick in spinach if it's
about about got a date I just kick a bit
of spinach in which is not really really
high and stuff like link and it's
protein source it's high magnesium
o'clock so apparently the key thing is
that the only real sugar for two days
between servers a lot of people use like
three apples or three origins we're just
using that and then mostly much
boom let's juice
so as you can see at the washing machine
in the background it's just one of those
days and so I have got my breakfast
smoothie which I've just pasted and it
is delicious it always takes a little
bit different when I use the good guru
protein oats in sort of the normal
Earth's and I feel like after gym
session that's probably quite a good
idea I don't take like gym protein or
anything like that so that's just a nice
way of adding a little bit more protein
in after workout which sorts of good for
your muscles and then I've got the juice
that Charlie's just made we have another
three bottles of this in the fridge
which will keep us going for the next
couple of days because as you may know
juicers are a nightmare to clean so it's
a really good idea to bulk make them so
while I drink those two I'm going to
write my to-do list for the day and
check up on any emails I might have
missed yesterday because we were out of
the house all day yesterday so I'm just
going to have a bit of a capture up for
licking those and then into shower
before work the day begins
so I'm just taking a break from my
emails and I just turned to look where
the puppies were picked up little Dicky
but I need to show you guys the position
that Dexter is currently lying in
it's not really an appropriate 289 then
such a really appropriate
okay so I had hopes to do a little get
ready with me showing you my natural
skincare favorites but time we're doing
emails just flew by I've showered cut
lunch and got ready since that I'll
spoke to you now going to take this
little chat but to the vet so you coming
in first vaccinations and then I'm
nipping it to the bank to officially do
boring stuff and so I will catch you
guys when we get back and I'll show you
my natural skincare favorites which is
what I was going to show you a minute
ago but cubed
ah okay so finally back home after what
feels like a bit of a manic afternoon
and I thought we'd have a little
catch-up I wanted to talk about some
natural skincare favorites I feel like
it works quite well in today's videos
because I've been quite healthy in so
far today and Charlie and I just try and
keep a really good balance like we're
not super health freaks we just try and
eat more healthily when we can but we
definitely don't like cut anything out
of our diets because we both love our
burgers far too much and we do have a
personal trainer once a week
Adam of Spurgeon active he is absolutely
incredible and then we both try and do
things like exercise classes luckily
with blogging a lot of brands sometimes
invite us to classes to like learn about
new products afterwards and also classes
our gym too so we try and just keep
quite active and then of course with the
dogs were often out and about walking
etc etc now I actually mentioned in a
video I think it was like a month in a
bit ago about how I like to be a little
bit more organic when it comes to food
and things like that and also I
mentioned an app slash birth control
pregnancy planning type set up called
natural cycles and I got a lot of
questions about it I think a lot of you
maybe thought it was too good to be true
but I've been using this now for two and
a bit months and I'm really really happy
with the results of it so basically I'll
leave the video I first discussed it
down below but I did want to give you a
little bit more information just because
I know that maybe hearing about it is
not as easy as seeing it
so just to recap natural cycles is the
world's first contraceptive app so
because it's an app you don't have to
ingest anything or things like that it's
a lot more of a natural way for
pregnancy planning or preventing in my
case and keeping a track of like your
periods things like that and I really
like it because you don't have to add
any hormones to your body it's a lot
more natural and very very easy to - we
all live on our smartphones these days
so it's really handy to just have that
I think all taken care of on your phone
as well as far as I'm aware it's the
only EU certified contraceptive app it's
about $70 for your annual membership and
then you also need the little
thermometer to what I do because really
you should use the thermometer to take
your temperature every single morning
you have about two hour time slot in
which you should take it so for me it's
between like 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. usually
I just do it as soon as I wake up before
you can get out of bed you literally
just literally just pop this monitor in
your mouth and this one is really
precisely it goes down to point to
decimals and then once you put your
temperature you just like put it in for
a couple seconds switched on first and
then you put the temperature that you
recorded in your natural cycles apps as
a little plus button up here you put
your temperature in and then because
you've been doing this for a few weeks
give it a few weeks to make sure it's
really accurate it'll tell you whether
it's a red day which it is for me today
or a green day is that whether you need
to use additional protection or not you
know what I'm saying so on the green
days basically you're not fertile on the
red days you are fertile so you need to
either abstain or just use additional
protection it sounds really really easy
and that's because it is for me this is
just the best solution when I am trying
to be a little bit more natural with my
lifestyle so yeah I thought I would just
update you guys on that and give a
little bit more information but as I
said I did talk quite a lot more about
it in a video about my whole wellness
routine a few weeks ago so I'll leave
that one linked down below as well so
please go and check that one out on the
note of being more natural with my
routine I'm going to now just quickly go
through a few of my natural skincare
favorites because there have been a few
new launches recently and one of them is
the Garnier skin active rose water
collection so this is the day cream I
actually have a brand new one because
they kindly sent me this amazing blogger
mail and this is a botanical day cream
and for me I was really attracted to try
this because Garnier is a brand that I
know
love really trust them and this I
believe is 96% natural ingredient so a
lot more natural than most of their
products but it still works so so well
smells amazing and it's just a really
lovely gentle day cream some really
enjoying using that not recently and
this is one I just plucked from my
shower it's a dr. organic virgin olive
oil body scrub and dr. organic is a
brand I really rate I find all their
product very effective this one has got
micro particles of volcanic lava that's
what exfoliates you I just think that's
really cool I like the consistency of
this and it actually really works to
scrub the body because the beads are big
enough and they're enough of them so
it's really nice to have a more organic
body scrub as you guys know microbeads I
just so that the environment so to scrub
yourself in lava it is definitely a
better option then we have my favorite
natural cleanser if you follow me on
Instagram stories you'll probably be
bored of hearing me talking about this
this is a brand called Niassa london and
this is their cleansing balm this is
such a pampering experience it just
works so wonderfully it's almost like a
face mask you really feel like the skin
is getting nourished from it I love it
quote me on this as much as my oscar
renascent cleansing balm it's more
luxurious than this I'll kind of and
polish big big fan of this one it works
wonderfully it's so luxurious and it's
natural too so big fan of this one not
totally natural but be to the variety
products are organic so this is the self
tanning anti age serum you can kind of
put a few drops of this into your night
cream and it really just helps you to
get a little bit more bronzed while you
sleep so I really love using this one
there are a lot of these kind of
products on the market but because this
one is more organic this is what I tend
to reach for on a regular basis if like
me your face goes paler quicker than
your body then this is potentially a
very good one to use you can use it on
its own or I like to mix it into a
slightly more creamy night cream that's
the Vita barata
anti age serum and then I also grabbed
the Liz Earle botanical shine shampoo
and conditioner now these are not fully
natural or organic as from of them as
far as I'm aware but they are a lot more
natural and organic than a lot of the
shampoos and conditioners on the market
obviously they're against animal testing
they're a cruelty-free brand I love
everything from the Zell these are new
fragrance and they smell so good
and yeah my hair really likes them it
makes it nice and soft and shiny but the
ingredients are really lovely you've got
organic aloe vera West African Shearer
apple and orange extracts blue sea kale
I think that's what actually makes the
shampoo foam instead of obviously having
any artificial foaming ingredients so
big fan of those as well and I do have a
lot more favorites and including some
organic candles but I did do a blog post
on natural and organic favorites maybe
three weeks ago it's only sour links
down below as well in case you want to
hear of any more but I can hear that
Charlie has now come inside from
watering the garden so that means that
we now are going to go down to the
dawdle pick up our blogger mail I think
there's going to be quite a lot we
haven't been in over a week
I'm going to head down there now and I
will catch up with you guys afterwards
ready for the mayhem ok back from Dada
and as you can see I am surrounded by
parcels I'm not going to do a blog a
melon boxing because I don't have time
we're going in to a friend's house in
half an hour so I'm just going to whiz
through everything we might do a couple
on Instagram stories yeah I'm standing
where
you're all playing okay so I didn't get
to film as much of my blogger mail
unboxing as I'd hoped because my memory
card became full so that's online oh my
goodness no I think it's just a shadow
it's been so hot so it won't surprise me
and that this room is now an absolute
bomb site full of packaging boxes oh my
goodness I'm going to have to attack
this tomorrow morning and that sorry
charlie is talking very loud on the
phone in the background and but yeah
we're heading over to a friend's house
now
we are going to watch the football it is
Manchester United vs. somebody I'm not
too sure I'll probably film a few clips
I don't know these guys that well so it
won't be too much but either way let's
get going and I'll catch up with you a
little bit later
okay so I didn't smoke yes so I can film
anything you see me because they were
just killing that voice I'm just chewing
our friends house watching football
having a good time for this vlog
anything apologies about that but we're
back home again we've just spent about
15 minutes out in the garden the deck
string begins playing mah-jongg it's
been three watching them play
I think getting dick Lee is the best
thing we did by deck and so yeah pretty
much just heading straight to bed now I
think that PT this morning really knocks
out my energy so swimming ready for a
fairly early night it's nearly enough
now so I think I'm just going to say
good night and I hope you guys enjoyed
today's baby blog a little bit of
everything today so you guys taking our
makeup off with it yes know that I
showed you guys about earlier and then
what I'm going to do afterwards is use
the oil from the same brand which I
really love this is the metamorphosis
revitalizing beauty oil and I love it
for just an evening skin care treat so
that's me I hope you enjoy today's vlog
and I all see you too all
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
