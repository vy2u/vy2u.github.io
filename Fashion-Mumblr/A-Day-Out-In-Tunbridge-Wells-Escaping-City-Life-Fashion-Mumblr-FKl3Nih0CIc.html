welcome to a new daily vlog I'm taking
you on a little bit of an adventure
today we are heading to Tunbridge Wells
which is in the southeast of UK and we
are going for a really nice winters cosy
day out really looking forward to a day
out of London away from the pollution
and the city we're going to be looking
for some really nice because you're
better on it's nice pubs hopefully some
cute little boutique so we can pick up
some nice gifts because we are already
thinking about just Christmases November
which means Christmas is not too far
away we are taking the train we've got
the southeastern railway to 212 it's
going to take us just under an hour
door-to-door so really really fast and
easy to get here and using their
off-peak ticket so very affordable for
and day out as well it is the next
station stop so let's go and explore
we've made it into Tunbridge Wells I'm
with April is looking very lovely and
warm we have not been here before either
of us have you yeah No
so it's both of our first times
exploring the town we have already found
it's a bit of a hidden gem it's a shop
called
biggy best it was like minutes walk from
the train station and it was selling the
most for useful little Christmas
trinkets we both said they're really
nice like gift ideas aren't there yeah
something
getting the usual Big John nuances of
the world so we're definitely going to
go back there lots of little like
handmade Christmas tree charms and hand
knitted stockings so we will definitely
be popping in there on our way back home
because we don't wanna be carrying heavy
candles all day so I'm going to let you
in on a little secret on how tactically
I like to find the kind of cute and
slightly more unusual places in towns
and certainly those more Instagrammers
spots instead of going to Google or
TripAdvisor
I like to use Instagram as my as my
search engine so what we've done here is
I went my phone and open up Instagram
and then on the search section I then go
to places and then search places near me
that brings up near current location and
then you can click on at the area that
you are so I clicked on Royals hundred
Wells and then I just have a scroll
through the most popular photos that we
were targeted in this area using that
search method we have come across a
little area called the
tires I think is called which looks like
it's full of really lovely Georgian
townhouses and independent boutiques
so Instagram has done as well and that
is going to be our next destination so
fingers crossed should be what we're
looking for
so let's go
welcome back your place same question
tonight so we just want to into this
lovely retailer behind me it's called
Susie Watson design has a chat with the
two lovely folks that worked inside and
basically it's it's an independent chain
of stores so they said they have eight
of these gorgeous stores in the local
area it's based out of Wiltshire and
Susie Watson is still doing all their
designing creating all the lovely
products but what we really really liked
about it is the fact that they have a
very ethical site reserved so we learn
about how a lot of the prints are made
out of India the embellishment is done
out in Sri Lanka and they had boards all
around the store explaining how and
where the items are made which was so so
nice none of this mass production we get
everywhere out it's really lovely trying
somewhere so cute
they had lots of really nice Christmas
gifts in there too as you would have
seen generally just a really really
lovely store so we'll definitely be
checking this one again on our way back
picking up a few knickknacks to take
home for Christmas
the we are on a mission to trying
somewhere for a nice cup of coffee
we've been recommended by the gentleman
in the Susan Watson Design School to
check out a place called Juliet so
keeping our eyes peeled for that I think
it's just that
it's absolutely perfect
you
please together
wake up at your place lovely cake Oh
Juliet that absolutely hit the spot and
they're dying
it is indeed it really did yummy Doris
over here put a hand back there
this one Doris dropped her Mac yeah we
both got Doris so now we are in the area
called the pan tails which is where we
aimed for and it's just like a really
cute arcade finally it's the oldest area
and actually where Tunbridge Wells
originated so nice historical reference
and the shops really kind of show that
they're really cute little old-school
cafes and independent boutiques there's
a farm shop Jack Wills depending on what
your kind of thing is so we're just
going to have a little tootle around
here looking at those stores
Tunbridge Wells is a spa town and I grew
up near Cheltenham I don't know if any
of you move into Cheltenham but that's
also a spa town and this area kind of
reminds me of the Montpelier area in
Cheltenham where it's a little bit more
boutique even more independent so
definitely a nice area to explore you
know we have just been to tourist
information and got a map so we're going
to attempt to read the map and head up
to Ben walk through the old town and
then up towards the common where
apparently there's a really lovely pub
that has an open fire curve another nice
cosy publishes yeah
April and I have ventured off the beaten
track and we are in search of a cozy pub
lunch preferably with an open crackling
fire because we have been walking for
the past couple of hours up and down
hills and we are both wearing heels both
wearing the least practical shoes for
days exploring and we burn a lot of
calories so we've heard from a few
different locals that Mount Edgecumbe
bar and Brasserie is really lovely and
cozy so we've actually tracked as you
can see through proper rural countryside
to get here but hopefully it's gonna be
worth it so let's go and see
well that most certainly was a hidden
gem we made our way to the Mount
Edgecumbe bar and Brasserie
unfortunately as we arrived about 4:30
they were not serving any food so April
and I still have slightly rumbling
tummies we're probably going to grab
some things on the high street again but
we did stay for some juice because it
was so adorable in there we were
definitely the only ones in there that
weren't locals but really nice to
experience that kind of thing when you
get out of town so because we are
rapidly losing daylight hours April and
I are gonna head back to the station now
quick dash down the high street to find
something to snack on and then we're
going to head back to London and as I
mentioned earlier it's only about 45
minutes so we'll be back in London town
before you know it our train gets us
straight into Waterloo East and for me
it's only 10-15 minutes in the tube so
it won't be long until I'm back with my
feet up at home
the reverse
