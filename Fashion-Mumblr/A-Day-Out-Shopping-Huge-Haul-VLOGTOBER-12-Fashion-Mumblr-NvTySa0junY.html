fun blog post which says Charlie and I
are heading into Freeport Braintree in
Essex which is
excited
I've already fixed
to get to the station I despise
so we just stepped off the tree and if I
literally just perfect it's really easy
to get into the chambers of an hour from
London but our train drivers are always
sorry actually took me on the slow track
so we were a little bit delayed but if
you can see around me it's really cute
it's kind of like going through villages
and this end
like Disney I'm Sarah headed inside now
if anyone's singing about gang and
espresso and definitely and check it out
here at first because I mean this is 116
pounds retail price its 113 yeah that's
50 pounds of a Charlie look
we're gonna get the money these are
amazing yeah let's get along to 4:35
normally 25 pounds each I'd like to get
two different colors though no no I
think two of these I really like this
color
can we get one it's awesome
I can't
so you just had major success in Ted
Baker what did you get darling
sorted he's underrating it basically
charlie has been looking for this coat
throughout what like two years I had my
favorite coat last year and he left it
in a park and he's just found the exact
same coat that he left in a pub yeah
literally half the price and we were
just saying that we've been to other
design outlet places and they just have
all the rubbish left but in that Ted
Baker store they had everything yeah
you've got a really nice base on as well
cheaper than normal yeah got some really
good pieces
just come on Paulista and Charlie was
trying on some jumpers we must have had
a group of like five ladies coming
around us they said it was because they
thought their sons of similar size I
think it's too pretty because Charlie
was getting us out
so we're back home now the train journey
home it's really quick it's about an
hour from London Liverpool Street and
then for us it's like 15 minutes on the
tube so it really didn't take us too
long to get home
Charlie's now are downstairs watching
the rugby it's the Australia that's in
New Zealand finally tonight someone's
gonna leave him to do that and show you
guys what we bought because I feel like
we've got some really really good pieces
as I said I hadn't been shopping in
quite a long time and to be honest
didn't really buy much kind of clothing
for me although there were loads of
stores for girls clothing but yeah
mostly like home and a few really good
pieces for Charlie so let me show you
what is in all these bags that I've got
behind me so firstly from Radley
everything in the shop was so discounted
and loads of like new season things I
didn't buy any handbags just cuz I
wasn't feeling hugely spendy but I did
pick up this is a bag in a bag in a
really cute light blue print and this
was eight pounds down from 11 pounds
which is really great I thought this is
really handy for now because obviously
we're getting charged for carrier bags
so really useful to have a bag in a bag
kind of wish I'd picked up a few more of
those because I think they'll be really
nice stocking fillers and then I also
got this really tiny handbag umbrella
doesn't have the price on it but I
remember I have a feeling it was 11
pounds down from about 28 so again
really really good price and I mean I
don't even know why you discount an
umbrella it's just such a handy thing to
have with you then the body shop and
they have some really good offers in
there it was basically if you buy two
things you get 30% off if you buy three
things it's um 35% off and four things
it's 40% off so we bought four things so
firstly I picked up the calomel silky
cleansing oil this is a blogger
favourite yet I haven't actually tried
it before so if it is a really good
opportunity to pick one of these up and
give it a go and then also the vitamin E
face mist and I really really like using
a face mist in the autumn because it
just is nice and refreshing on my skin
especially if the skin gets a little bit
dry so got one of those charlie chose
this which is a face scrub and then just
to make it up to four things I grabbed
this headband which is really useful for
when you're cleansing your skin in the
evening so they were the bits I got from
the body shop outlet I
like how liquor is they packaged their
things we've got this kind of canvas
tote bag and then inside it's the salt
and pepper things which you source and
I'm kind of arguing over the colors in
this really cute box so I think if
you're going to get them for a gift and
that's a really really nice way of
presenting it so I personally thought
that we should have got two in the same
color but Charlie was determined to get
one in one in each color so we got an
orange kind of like ombre shaded salt
shaker which is really nice and then a
black pepper middle it's got a copy and
an S on the top and by far the most
practical purchase of our whole trip we
got a can opener
this is $11.99 done from $7.99 me and I
just tend to break can openers so we
thought we'd get a decent quality one
next was Hollister and Charlie got this
really lovely gray jumper it was I think
it was 1699 yet and then I believe that
there was an additional 30% off so it's
a really nice kind of classic gray
jumper for Charlie and then I got this
lovely again really classic navy juillet
I'll show you in the mirror in a second
it's got little pockets and super soft
fur lining which I absolutely love so
this was it says on the price tag 2699
but after the sale I think it was like
18 pounds so absolute bargain just give
it a try for you they come a bomb site
behind me I just think G lays are really
really practical for autumn because
sometimes you just don't want a full
coat and yeah I think this one is really
really lovely I mean 18 pounds for
hostage elay absolutely crazy it's so
snuggly and warm then we move on to Ted
Baker and we definitely had the biggest
session in Ted Baker Charlie did
particularly well as I think you heard
with his coat and blazer situation I've
got a couple of bits as well which I
shall show you so I got this gorgeous
pair of gray leather and fur gloves and
they've got a beautiful like rose gold
zip detail in there as well which i
think is just so pretty I thought
originally that these zip unzipped off
the fur but it doesn't do that I did
have a check and this leather is so soft
they just feel like such incredible
quality
so the RRP on the ears was 79 pounds and
I've got to be honest I
never spend 80 pounds on gloves but 45
pounds for these I thought was a really
good price I'm really happy I picked
these up there are a few different
colors there's also a burgundy but these
were the only prepare so I snatched up
those as soon as I saw them these on the
other hand they were absolutely loads of
I thought this was just such an adorable
little box it says 45 on here but I
don't think I paid forty five pounds for
I know that's a Euro sign but I thought
this would be really handy just for
putting my jewelry in maybe jewelry when
I'm traveling and it's kind of like a
beige color with a cane rose gold zip
and a little bow on the top so I thought
that was really really beautiful and
then these are the pieces that we got
for Charlie from Ted Baker this blazer
is really lovely heroes this for kind of
like work meetings it's got a lovely
pattern on the hem there and then really
cool bright lining as all Ted Baker
things do it's a little pocket square
and what was this so 169 down from 259
which is absolutely amazing and as it's
Ted Baker quality is really really
lovely and then he also got this coat
and as we said earlier this is a coat
that he did actually have a couple of
years ago but then he lost it and this I
believe that's how look how much this
one was again 279 down to one seven nine
so I mean we were planning on buying it
with my student discount in the shops
which is 20% off but the fact that we've
got a hundred pounds of absolutely crazy
I think this Ted Baker in the Freeport
just had so many more decent styles and
better sizes like Charlie's a very
average size so many guys houses the
same size as him so it's really rather
he finds things and outlet stores so
yeah really really pleased with those
and so that's it that's all the bits
that we picked up from our little trip
to Freeport Braintree as you can see in
my room is a bit bomb site now so I
probably need to give that a bit of a
tidy and as it's Saturday the 31st today
it's Charlie and I are now heading out
to a Halloween party when the rugby's
over so I'm gonna go ahead and paint my
face I don't know of what yet but
next on the agenda but yeah it's been a
really really fun day and I'm definitely
gonna be heading them back to Freeport
when I want to do my Christmas shopping
I tend to leave it quite last-minute but
um yeah I might try and do it a little
bit earlier this year but I just
couldn't leave how close it was to
London and we just had a really fun day
picked up so many bargains and yeah I
definitely recommend you guys to go and
check out if you live near bikes it was
just a really lovely lovely day out so
