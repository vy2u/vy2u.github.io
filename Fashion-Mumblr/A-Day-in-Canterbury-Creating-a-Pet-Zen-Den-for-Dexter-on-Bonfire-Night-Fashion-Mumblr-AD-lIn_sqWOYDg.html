bonfire night vlog it's the fifth of
November today and Charlie and I are
currently in Canterbury so we got the
train really early this morning we got
the like 9 o'clock train from Kings
Cross and Pancras to Canterbury so just
kind of fun see today out of London do
something a little bit different and
yeah we're just going to take some
photos because we found this really
beautiful area this whole place is
really pretty to be honest we've just
found this kind of archway and there's
this beautiful house behind this so
Charlie's is perfecting his outfit
before we take some photos of him and
we've got Dexter with us too you can see
him looking very inquisitive over there
so yeah it's gonna be a nice day I
thought I would vlog it take you guys
along with me and then later on we're
gonna we're not going to spend all day
here probably going to head back early
afternoon and we're going to go to the
Battersea or Brockwell fireworks you
haven't decided which one yet but yes I
work nights boo should be a fun day
so we found our way back to Westgate
Gardens I didn't really vlog in the town
didn't vlog in the town because I feel
like even worse than London people here
just look at me as I'm absolutely crazy
at the slightest hint of camera but yeah
we've had a really lovely morning
exploring it's just after 3 o'clock now
and we've just been taking even more
blog photos Charlie wants to copy my old
tunnel so he's been taking some photos
in the park we had a really nice ones
around so many nice shops here like
they're like boutiques and we had a
really lovely lunch at this gluten-free
restaurant called something in Bentley's
I'm not sure when I'll leave it writing
on the screen right now so if you're
gluten intolerant like that was really
really nice and even if you're not I had
a really lovely risotto very festive
menu
I don't know why my eye bags are so bad
today maybe one dehydrated but yeah
we're actually heading back to the train
station now and we're gonna get the
train back to London we have
specifically chosen this train because
loads the trains like two hours for this
one is only an hour long so heading back
to London should get back home about a
half past five I think the fireworks
start at seven ish and Battersea but
before we head out we've got to make it
we're going to Brockwell much cheaper
yeah Battersea is like ten pounds this
year far too much yeah it's really
expensive but yeah before we go out
we're obviously not going to take Dexter
with us to the fireworks so we need to
create a little haven for him and make
it a lot more relaxing for him at home
so yeah I'll show you what we do to the
house to make it a little more sense a
deck yes he needs a brother but
hopefully because he's been walking so
much today
he might be quite tired too hopefully he
won't get too scared later with all the
bands
though we are home again after what was
a surprisingly quick journey only took
just under an hour in the train and
we're back home now and I'm just opening
up a blog a mail surprise surprise tip
my room is oh my god I just opened up
some bloggers melt from clinique I don't
know if they knew that I was traveling
on Monday but they sent me a bag of
travel sized beauty products which is
very kind of especially especially
thankful for the mini my slow water this
is like their cleansing oil but you
don't need water so really good for on
the plane I wanted to show you because
this is really funny also in the orange
bag exclusive to heart until Friday was
this and it was open and I feel I mean
I'm sure it was like broken in the post
and just popped open but the way that is
open and there's like a third of what
should be in there is actually in there
made me think maybe they would like
passed me around the office and then
they thought Oh Jesse would likely use
this six time in her back I don't know I
just so I was really funny so thank you
clinic for the mini goodies and VM those
Speights if you did put them in there
after snacking tell them in the office
then thank you I'm very very tasty but
just looking in the bottom of the bag
there are a few bites and there's and
maybe I just burst in the post yeah I
just thought that was really funny so
yeah that's why I'm up to at the moment
and also trying to upload some photos
for a blog post that's going live
tomorrow morning and we are leaving in
about 45 minutes to go to Ben and
Katie's house because they live on some
John's Hill I think it's called in North
London near Hampstead some don't way
around that and and they have an epic
view across but Primrose Hill we don't
spark so we're gonna go and watch the
fireworks from there we are going to
leave a little sausage man here so in a
few moments once my images are uploaded
I'm gonna start creating a pet Zen den
so that he doesn't get too stressed out
by the fireworks just look at this bag
of chocolate again and the top has been
cut off so they literally have in the
office
in my bags is so funny oh my god yeah it
definitely been ripped open that could
not have happened in the post I was just
absolutely so Charlie and I are about to
leave in about 10 15 minutes to go and
see the fireworks but before we go
because we're not taking this little
sausage with us and yes he has a pink
jumper on some huh oh yeah not as quite
as manly as pink and because we're
leaving Dexter at home we're going to
create a bit of a pet Zenden here at
home so that he feels a bit more relaxed
and doesn't get scared by the fireworks
and and I don't know how many of you
guys spotted my snapchats a few days ago
but I received a big bundle of bits and
bobs from hive who make the home hub
that controls your heating and lighting
and things in the house and they sent
over a load of tips for keeping your pet
calm during bonfire night from celebrity
vet Marc Abraham's so we're going to
follow some of those tips now so that
Dexter doesn't get too stressed out
because sausage dogs notoriously get
very stressed and very anxious
so not only are these tips gonna be
useful tonight but also just other
evenings when we leave him because
little boys do get stressed out
sometimes ok so this is what we're going
to set up this is the hive hub and I
believe that because basically we're
getting a hive central heating put in
our house next week I believe that that
will also be controlled from this but
just for tonight we're going to set up
the hive active light because if there's
lots of flashing outside it's going to
stress him out so we're just going to
create a really nice dim atmosphere in
here you think this so we're going to
try and make it quite a warm orange
--red tone in here that's what Mark the
vet said will help to soothe him so
we're going to put this in our light
fitting over there which kind of
controls the lounge and then Chaz and I
if you've got your phone with you we
need to set up the hive app on our
phones and yeah download the hive app so
that when we hear any fireworks so that
when we hear fireworks and we know that
Dexter might be getting scared we can
just dim the lights down a little bit so
that's amazing that we can do that from
our phones and then also in the bundle
I've sent us a new pet blanket
so that's excused the washing that's
over there in the corner by his bed so
he's gonna be nice and snuggly and they
also sent in this little toy and I think
having something that they already know
and love such as this as you can tell
he's already ripped the legs off some
things that will just keep him feeling
at home and comfortable look at him
oh we're going to miss us or surge right
while Charlie downloads the app I'm
gonna read through the rest of Mark
Abraham's tips he said keep your pets
well-fed and refreshed so they also sent
us these treats these are love hearts
fruit smoothies as you can tell by the
shredded bag Dexter absolutely love
these so we're going to give him a few
treats and we've made sure his food and
water is out for him because a hungry
pet is a more anxious pet and we're
doing everything we can to create a pet
Sundance that he doesn't get anxious so
food dimmed lighting and toys other tips
so far another of Marc's tips is to keep
them warm so obviously we do have the
blanket next week we will have the hive
heating but in the meantime we have had
our fire on for the past hour or so
while we've been at home so this room is
nice and warm at absolutely sweltering
in my jumper but it means that Dexter
will be kept nice and snuggly while
we're out at the fireworks and then
another have marks tips there are so
many honestly this is really good if you
have any anxious pets like we do is to
play music and M&amp;amp;M yes but what I
thought be even better than playing
music would be to stick on one of my
youtube videos because then he can hear
mummys boys I think if he hears my boys
know if I put if I put on a vlog then
he'll just think that mummy and daddy
are here so I'm gonna put on one of my
youtube videos and hopefully that will
chill him out and he'll just think we're
in another room or something so as you
can see charlie is starting to take over
now and this is our hyper Brys fries
yeah it's really tiny so we can plug
that into our Rooter according to
instructions and that's it really plug
it in
it says to plug the bulbs in first yeah
oh no - geo Rooter and then fit the
bulbs and then connect the bulbs to the
hub and the app so while Charlie does
that I'll just explain to you the plan
of action so basically when Charlie and
I are out and we start to hear the
fireworks we can turn the lights to a
very soft ready orange color which
hopefully will chill out this little man
because they're quite warming and
relaxing colors so hopefully it'll make
our little chap feel a lot more chilled
out at the moment it's just fairly
bright so it's not surprising that he
could get stressed if we left the lights
as they are and I think if it was dark
in the house it would just be far too
scary for him but we can save energy and
electricity by just switching them on
from our phones instead of losing them
on like that all evening which is the
amazing thing about having the app and
then I guess once we get the heating set
up if we because obviously we don't
leave Dexter at home all day when we
have meetings we have a dog-sitter drop
him off back home at about 4 o'clock so
we from our phones will be able to turn
the heating on just before Dexter gets
home so the house is nice and warm
because in the winter it just be too
cold for him here even in the couple of
hours before China I get home from work
so save us lots of money from not home
to the heating on all day
I've just been finishing getting myself
ready while Charlie figures it all out
have you got to figure out darling yeah
yeah ok so let's try and set it to like
a warm orangie relaxing shade house like
orangey oh yeah like this yeah
that's peaceful it's kind of like spa
icing yeah no it up so you can see very
injured look this light bulb behind me
oh my gosh that's really good yeah so we
are going to such a football off and put
my youtube on rugby sorry darling
and Dexter at the moment can you see him
over there it's gonna focus it's looking
very chilled out so hopefully he's gonna
stay that way we've done all of Marky's
hands tips so gonna kiss her little
sausage goodbye and head out to Ben and
Katie's in the safe knowledge that he'll
be totally relaxed
is pet Zenden see you later my little
sausage like you you're going to the
varalakshmi salmon core jumper there we
go oh the toy for little boys to keep
you company
and a treat for mr. Rooney do you like
these win sausage yes oh thank you mommy
you can just save it for later thank you
mom he always hates it when we say
goodbye probably try and come with us
I was looking fairly sure actually
Belinda Mulrooney bad leaving him behind
but we've got 45 minutes to make it up
to Northwest London let's go and see the
power so let's go
so Charlie and I got to the pub just as
the fireworks for ending we just caught
very as we were walking we did see a few
more they didn't yeah we've seen a fire
a fire so we're gonna go and join Ben
and Kate inside get some Peter I'm gonna
try and persuade Jason to let me buy
like knockdown price fireworks tomorrow
no Dexter would not be amused hopefully
he's alright though in his van damme so
we're gonna go and enjoy a glass of
champers or two no no a little baby is
safe at home on our way to a station now
Katie and I are dreaming about which one
are you gonna get darling none of these
on here but one of the white one right
there yeah
we're just kind of arguing over who's
going to get the six million pound house
and who's going to get a seven moment
but yeah this area of seriously
beautiful I think Katie made a good move
moving up north then you die is that it
is past time I'm like oh nanny London
but then yes is that when you again yes
you've got the best debate world don't
even feel like you're in London right
now we totally missed out on the
fireworks so different we did yeah they
saw a grand total about five fireworks
that was that yeah heading back home now
so I catch up with girls later
okay so we finally just got home I can
still hear fireworks going off in the
background so let's go into the lounge
and see how much some sausages Oh have
you been sniffing mr. sausage
Karen kiss your mommy well mommy I had a
very relaxing evening thank you for
putting out all of my toys and my
blanket
oh we were only away for about three
hours in total which is pretty much the
longest that we ever like leave him at
home but he seems totally chilled out
and fine so I guess it wasn't too
traumatic for him despite the fact that
there are still a few bangs going on
outside it's probably about half 10 but
people are still out partying and
bonfire night fire working Charlie and I
are having a bit of a laugh because
there's so many people dressed up about
to go out clubbing on top of High Street
but we're off to bed we're gonna take
Dexter to bed with us tonight just
because there's still a little bit of
firework noise going on in the
background so we're gonna take in to bed
just so he doesn't get scared so I'm
going to make sure he's all fed and
watered take him outside to the bathroom
and then go upstairs
oh are you making yourself at home mr.
Susie hinge have you had a hard day have
you my little mink see well the good
news is Dexter is most definitely not
traumatized by the fireworks look at him
he's totally chilled out so we will
definitely be using our new hive setup
and the ambient lighting light bulbs to
create a more relaxing atmosphere for
him even on the days when there's not
fry works by the day that we're just
gonna be out a little while so do worry
about him getting all stressed at home
so it's good to know that we found and I
feel silly sharing it to create there's
a pet Zen den for him because after all
I would do anything for my sausage but
it's nice to have all this kind of
technology in the home as well
especially considering it's so so easy
to use especially even for our
technology stars like myself so knowing
that my little boy is nice and
peacefully happy I'm gonna get into bed
now I think I'm going to try an oyster
mask
I've actually got this one from Shiseido
this is called the beauty sleep mask I'm
gonna give this a try and hopefully wake
up with some nice glowing skin because
we've done lots of outdoor activities
tonight walking to the fireworks
although not really seeing too many
fireworks and then obviously this
morning Canterbury we're outside so my
skin feels a little bit dry so can I
give myself a bit of an obsession I
think China are going to watch Sherlock
or the missing and head to bed so I hope
you guys enjoyed this one day vlog of
our trip to Canterbury and bonfire night
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next one bye
say goodnight Dexter goodnight everybody
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
