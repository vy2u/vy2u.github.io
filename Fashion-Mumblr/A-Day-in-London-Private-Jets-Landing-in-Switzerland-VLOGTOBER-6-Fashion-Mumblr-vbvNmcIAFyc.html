Tober part 606 my hands open I realized
I don't have enough free hands and so as
you can probably see I am in London the
game today back from Amsterdam really
late last night didn't vlog our journey
coming home to us just so tired and my
camera virtue is putting out such a
really long match yesterday my eyes are
watering because it's so cold
yeah back in London now
I'm really really missing Dexter so
because you're in Amsterdam last weekend
but also away this weekend for another
little sis break Dexter has stayed with
my mom so I haven't seen him in like
five days I'm not gonna sing over
another five days so really really miss
him Dexter but my mom just sent the
cutest email as though she is Dexter
like write him in his voice if I'm
really missing my mommy and daddy so
cute and she's been sending loads of
pictures so that's really cute at her
home so our breath so today in London
I've just got loads of meetings a few
different events and things going on so
first is my first museum day is done
I've got some nice new attributes to try
out announced on my way to benefit from
chemistry to get my eyebrows done
Brow's done by
much better now they always show them
and shake them so where I had no brows I
now actually have some I just picked up
some lunch very pink
it's pretty nice and now I'm just
waiting
we're next
kind of dissing I'm doing
next I'm hoping I might have time to
stop into Space NK because my makeup is
all melted off my totally different CC
cream this one
hopefully you have time to stop in the
space and cater for
police have just finished filming and I
was
like day in the life video decision
Boulevard my star
when I watch and I like and my favorite
London
and I got to borrow the most amazing
pair sunglasses they were friendly they
have entitled diamante on them initially
most the reasons I'm last ever so
definitely have them on my shopping list
yeah we're just filming in the Chelsea
and they're going to make a short film
so went nuts out I'll link it down below
otherwise I'm excited for you guys to
see that one now we see a big Christmas
launch so I'm not really sure what it is
I think it might be done to menu menu so
on my way back towards central now and
then I don't know if you didn't know
with my friends became worried later on
which again I think you'll auntie
so are now in the Animas section on
officers feet and I didn't even realize
but they have this whole little in
lounge
where you can get as many facials done
but what I'm about to have done behind
I'm just loving this furniture behind me
here this law construction is a sin and
now assist device so the lovely journey
is about to stand my face maybe she can
stall out on tell me I can do for that
very problem are telling you about in
the last vlog so yeah just going to find
out
so I've just had my skin scattered here
the other mess comes in these are my
results no quite as scary as I thought
they might be
the wrinkles on that green one looks a
little bit scary but that's because it
picked up some of my hair but very my
skin so a bit dehydrated which makes it
show up I got more wrinkles when I do
that nothing to be too worried about
texture wise don't pick up that
weirdness what's going on yeah
that's there's like green and yellow to
the game picking up the dehydration also
okay some damage I really need to be
careful I definitely wasn't a sycamore I
know this and you know what I'm trying
new moisturizer always yeah we're just
gonna meet him a couple on that and then
that one in the corner the red areas it
shows my skin is a little bit sensitive
so I've been recommended some products
from LMS
and our moisturizer just renounce this
is really good timing this is the pro
quo to marine breeze
really nice this is a good moisturizer
like two little most likely tablets and
you use one in the morning and one in
the evening and that should calm down
this thing that I've got going on this
is quite a sense to try and I'm
researching Java so
it is Friday not morning it's actually
afternoon now I did not pick up the
camera to start vlogging until now
because you've had cried I I have had
quite a crazy day today obviously cannot
talk very well as you might guess from a
makeup I have just been filming I have
not just been chilling around the house
of the full face of makeup but basically
China I are off to Switzerland this
afternoon so I've had quite a busy
morning preparing some blog posts and
just found a video which needs to go up
actually before you see this so it's
going up you might have gone up
yesterday basically what it's going to
go up on Sunday and this is going up on
Monday if all goes to plan but I thought
I would just show you the bomb site that
my room is after I finished filming
because um I was watching I think it was
Susie's blog the other day and she was
saying like the Holy Spirit part of
being a youtuber is the filming
aftermath and I have to agree because
this is the stated one bedroom at the
moment we've got to put away the camera
equipment we've got to sort out all the
makeup and so if you saw yesterday's
video you'll know that I just filmed a
new end video and they are like the
craziest videos to film because I spend
like three weeks collecting products
because I don't want to start using it
until I've done the little close-up
pictures and to feature in the video so
I've had so many products just building
up but I finally filmed it I feel like
it's a load off my shoulders now that's
filmed and I also tried out a few of the
products today before I filmed it so I
tried be a two-faced on this way
foundation which I'm really liking my
skin as you know is not good at the
moment and but it's got given a really
lovely coverage I'm really I'm quite
lucky how it's coming up on this camera
so hopefully it's come up as a nicely on
the actual video as well and then I used
a new Kiko eyebrow thing which is
actually not quite the right colour but
really like the product then I used two
revlon colorburst matte balm and all the
links to the exact ones I'm using are in
the new and video
from yesterday so just how look at that
if you wanna know exactly what else and
then I also use the new L'Oreal steam
pot in order to show you because this is
quite a crazy contraption it's basically
this and and I'll say this a couple of
weeks ago so I've been trying this out
it's from look fantastic and it's like a
hair straightener which uses steam to
straighten your hair instead of the
ceramic plates so it's a really good
idea if you're concerned about the
condition of your hair if your hair is
colored like miners or you just don't
want to be like heat damaging your hair
with ceramic straighteners everyday so
that I'm really impressed with torch a
little bit more about that in the video
so now I'm going to tidy up this little
mess it's about two o'clock now Charlie
and I figured out we need to leave home
about four o'clock in order to get to
London South and for six o'clock so yeah
tidying up then I'm gonna run to dawdle
to click my post and because hopefully
there's some things we're trying to wear
while we're in Switzerland so gonna run
down there now and I have any in
anything all day I've had to hobble teas
and a bar of chocolate
another aero bar from last night so I
need to eat something I've got some soup
in the fridge why am I telling you this
this is so boring I'm gonna go and get
my post I'll see you guys later
so back home now picked up a few pieces
from dawdle and we just had a nice bowl
of soup and french react for lunch and
one of the things that I picked up was
really exciting I wanted to tell you
about it because it's for charity which
is really close to my heart I'm not
gonna go and do a sob story and tell you
why but it's my cure charity which is
one of the charities or subtly the
charity that I most like to support so I
thought I'd tell you about still
campaign that's going on so basically
the Superdry are doing some work with
Marie Curie
and actually with Frankie from The
Saturdays so they work together for this
campaign and their goal was to raise a
hundred thousand pounds for the charity
and they've already smashed it which is
amazing so now their aim is to raise 200
thousand pounds and what Superdrug are
doing for the campaign is that every
time you buy a PNG product then they
will donate something into the charity
and also if you do a selfie on Instagram
or Twitter with a hashtag which I can't
remember so I'm gonna put it over the
screen here then a donation will be made
as well so I've been sent a selection of
PNG goodies which you can get from
superdrug so I thought I'd show you them
and if any of these are your favorite
products then make sure you go and buy
them either today or tomorrow it's very
very last minute but yeah go out and buy
them because they don't cost you any
more but if you buy them today or
tomorrow then some of your money will be
going towards Meijer and Kure so I
didn't even realize all these fans of
PNG but the head and shoulders I mean
this is a ginormous bottle of shampoo
smooth and silky everybody uses head and
shoulders so go and stock up now on that
one and then Olay there's so many
amazing new early products at the moment
this is the age defying moisturizer
which they've sent me and I mean
everybody uses Olli products as well
this is one my mom's favorite so I'm
gonna get her to go down and stock up
today um v5 is very dull so soon or
Vidal Sassoon I never really know but
yeah they are donating it towards my
career as well and then these are the
most handy things ever it's perfect
timing because I'm going just it's only
time about stop packing after I show you
guys this this then you snap erasers
seriously the handiest things in the
whole world and
well essences everybody loves a good
hell essences shampoo this is the Herbal
Essences limited edition for vibrant
colors so absolutely perfect and as with
all her butt essences it smells amazing
what else we got some oral-b pieces so
let me just go and stock up on like
stuff you are gonna buy anyway and just
buy it from super dr. hill tomorrow
because you'll be donating money to
charity so this isn't sponsored by the
way this is just because the charity is
really close to my heart as I said and
it's a really good campaign and you
don't really have to do anything other
than just buy the stuff today or
tomorrow from Superdrug so if you want
to donate to charity head down the
Superdrug and I'll leave more
information in the information box and
down below that you can find out all the
proper details without having to listen
to me remember all about them so yeah
just got to at Liverpool Street I'm
waiting for a train and now which
Southend
where I went from my rectum Anoka
man before Johanna
so that we should be here soon and I'm
trying to resist temptation right now
so we're currently on the train although
we're not entirely sure if or on the
right train because I don't really have
a mess up south and Victoria we're on
the right train little bit of a mess up
at the difficult extinction but more
excitingly look Caroline I'm taking
really quietly because we've been them
having a bit verbal conversation instead
of always physical yeah so we're keeping
it down low well no we're not just
having a good on giggle at that
pre-filming a bit that you do you know
maybe if you're not you might not notice
but before we start talking I would use
like something like fiddling at the hand
going like this before actually I like
that hi guys I could try next video
first
hello chuckle about that and do an innie
at Southend Airport now Hannah is
patiently waiting for her turn to start
blogging 7:00
we are in the first-class language at
Southend Airport and got little feet
behind me just like that hi Johanna tuck
again I'm about to tuck in here for us
13 of us going on this airplane tonight
so it's literally like Jack whistling us
the way to Switzerland
I think aside from the multi-engine
aircraft
and really look very very much everybody
our room at the FLV Palace has been and
I won't show you the room could be
because it's amazing it's this ginormous
room and the bathroom isn't she's
bathroom is so lovely so we've got this
big bathroom here which is all lovely
and marble and they've got more to Brown
cosmetics over here so good job I didn't
pack that shampoo in the end because I'm
not gonna need it and and we've got a
few little goodies from burn tourism
over desks so I'm guessing is probably
just gonna be press releases yep looks
like it and also randomly a pair of
binoculars so we can do a little bit of
spying I don't know they've got the cats
on and so yeah we've got a busy day
planned tomorrow but now we're just
gonna go down to the hotel bar grab some
drinks for the rest of the gang and I'll
show you downstairs because it's so
pretty here
so I didn't do an outfit of the day
earlier and I just found this big murus
I thought I could show you what I'm
wearing today this GLA I thought was
really good before exploring Switzerland
and this is from Topshop and then my
white long-sleeve jumper this is a sip
dry one which I might have seen in my
haul and the jeans are the baby ones
that you've seen it quite a lot and
these boots these are from nu and yeah
so they'd be really good for exploring
something so we are back in the hotel
room now I think chai and I are going to
get a reasonably early night so it's
just just gone midnight so not too early
at all
but I thought I'd try and cut show you
the view from the balcony because it's
seriously it's spectacular but I'm not
sure gonna see anything behind me
okay that was better
fail let's go back who's hired basically
earlier there was this incredible castle
which was all lit up by spotlights and
which we could see really clearly from
the balcony and all the river had little
lights along it which was just the most
beautiful view but I guess maybe they
turn the lights of those off at midnight
which is just gone so I will have to
show you in the morning so I'm gonna end
this vlog here because I really want to
do a full switzerland vlog like I did
for the Amsterdam vlog so tune in for
that next time and until then I'll see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
