in the life of a fashion blogger no two
days are ever the same but this I
suppose would be my typical nine-to-five
routine let's get started I usually wake
up at around 6 a.m. coffee let the dogs
out cleanse my skin and I apply a little
bit of makeup to make myself feel
slightly more human and it's straight
out the door to the gym
I'd like to do short but intense
workouts to make the most of every
minutes in the mornings so I have a PT
three times a week
we'll do short bursts of high-intensity
exercise to really get the heart rate
going I can monitor my progress on my
Michael Kors
access SmartWatch using the built-in
fitness tracking the skill mill is a
serious calorie burner and I usually
finish the session with some ab
exercises too and exercises using the
kettlebell weights
back home I try to get through as many
emails as possible it's nice to start
the working day with an empty inbox as a
blogger you're running your own business
so organization is hugely important I
keep track of my meetings on my Michael
Kors watch powered by Android where it
shows me my notifications as well as my
calendar which I find is especially
useful for keeping on track mid-morning
and it's time to film once my camera is
set up I try to film that leaves two
videos at a time today is a beauty
favorites and a what's in my handbag
video
this afternoon I'm meeting my
photographer so I pick out some of my
key winter outerwear pieces but I'll be
featuring on the blog next week my
SmartWatch lets me know that my uber is
here
time to go
today we're shooting at palmar which is
one of my favorite photogenic spots in
London as a fashion blogger
of course my accessories need to be
functional and stylish another reason I
adore my Michael Kors access Sophie
SmartWatch a glamorous rose gold design
with interchangeable watch faces which
you can switch up depending on your
outfit of the day you can also change
the straps whenever you want to switch
up your style
it fits perfectly with my style the
ultimate accessory
I can use Google assistant on the watch
- I asked how long it will take me to
get to my first meeting of the day at
some James's square time - - off I don't
want to be late
it's a quick coffee meeting to start
with this afternoon and then I hop in
the cab to my next meeting
checking my email and notifications
while on the go
my favorite kind of meeting is an
afternoon tea usually I'll catch up with
a beauty or fashion PR coordinator who
will talk me through their latest
collections and show me the newest
launches
as I'm an early riser I tried to be
strict to myself to finish my working
day at 6:00 oh it looks like Charlie's
in town and wants to meet for cocktails
sounds good to me
