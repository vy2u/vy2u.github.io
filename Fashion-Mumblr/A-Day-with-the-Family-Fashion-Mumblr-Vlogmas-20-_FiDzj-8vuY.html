hard drive decided to crash so I lost
all the files that I originally did and
it's just pretty soul-destroying when
you have to refill a video especially
get ready with me because it takes so
long but um yeah so did that yesterday
morning and then I was submitted going
to Tampa some meetings but they got
rearranged so I said to Hannah might
wanna go mine and we'll just do some
festive fun stuff and we ended up
filming in front of our Christmas tree
cuz Hannah was like oh it's so beautiful
and I realized I hadn't actually fell in
front of the Christmas trees so that's
what we did and then I came home to
mom's house we had fish and chips

chips because my thing and um much
