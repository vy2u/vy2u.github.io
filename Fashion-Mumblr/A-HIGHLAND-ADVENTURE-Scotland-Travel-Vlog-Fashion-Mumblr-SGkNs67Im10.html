couple of days it's actually in mine and
Charlie's or Fighting's 31 in Charlie's

new cx-5 which is an update on their
previous 4x4 having a cousin days away

Scottish Highlands and yeah he talks
pain also I'm not going to know my
preview from pretty much a soulmate
yeah I'm not signals reacts well the
curly stream aimed my naughties spotify
playlist had our Lavigne we've had
Shaggy wasn't me but the important thing
is my
office is on so we're having a little
bit of a break from the work emails to
the polls to quickly show you this view
because it is spectacular
so ensure this morning from p5 in Venice
we picked up the car and we drove for a
couple of hours to a castle consulate
castle your elf stop us all or dark
which is very W had lunch there and then
we drove another two hours to John
O'Groats moving in the past few hours
and now we're heading to a place called
time which currently is very very much
genic and we sing address the past as
well though I think we've got some
scenic shots but main community approach
bring the cards attack kinda struggling
it's really smooth and actually rich
comfortable the chair I got really bad
bombing and we don't see the moments in
our in our my lion my since college
system is called it's actually been
drivin driving lines receive atlases
clock on what also gets notice notice
that that's why the sounds are both sat
system so yeah he's a big fan of the car
already so yeah everyone there's another
thing we've got 42 miles and just over
an hour get some
let's enjoy
all right no I won
alright see the
behind the
the boss guy
marry him
reform
get applied world
now and then we
so we're about 50 miles away from now
we're driving through a school track
lava and source information we just
passed before a couple of brown sheep
going through the tourist information an
efficient ship drop from Class C they
put their logo and the tsukushi back out
to the city for their priorities through
here for every time we turn corner the
scenery just is absolutely breathtaking
it's like something out of Lord of the
Rings means they filmed a lot quartering
okay Game of Thrones yeah apparently
it's like these pallies and I'm hugely
high heels it helps with driving at
Golden Hour right now at car seven and
eight the light music spectacular but
yeah these dramatic valleys and big rock
formations I'm trying to sell them as
much as I can without making this video
like a giant Phoenix Gotland video but
that's pretty much what we're seeing in
a moment I look at there by white Walker
territory yeah you know I will could
argue yeah
and there's so many animals everywhere
some things I've got through in front of
everything is another little brown sheep
course large perhaps not quite those
objects but yeah I've also discovered
that I have a secret passion filming
cars I mean it help with this cars
rather go to Jenny but every time you
pull over like a charlie means 3/8
himself I did get a hammer out and I'm
filming clips of the car because it's
just so beautiful against these
drownings smashing my little tongue yeah
so it feels good to be on my feet again
after probably have four and a half
hours of the car but we made it to a
place called tongue or I think they call
it Tonga yeah I'm going to the tongue
hotel and if you guys just saw the view
that I just showed but it's basically
they looked it looks like we're in the
Alps or something so spectacular so
we're hoping that this case it's going
to serve dinner and because we did make
a reservation near our hotel with us
another two hours away and we all know
how to teach our against when he's
hungry so Charlie and Matt are down
there yeah can I get some grub and then
back on the road background so a couple
of days ago how anybody was going to
start eating council you got thing I'm
like yes Frank John's gone for a burger
this is something other than a child
hide fish and chips lunch I had burger
and now confer correct thank you very
much
now we're on the road again and once
more we have incredible speed Republic's
it is about half 9:00 at night and the
stars still have not set against
incredible sunset views we drive we're
heading north west now and even con men
were heading into zag I think it's the
next destination yet going to out 77
miles and that there is a NEMA night so
we've got our our cars back because
inoculate fast he was going but feeling
very smart in it slower
c'mon
you
so I just had to forth charlie to pull
over because we've just driven past the
most beautiful beach while listening to
Enya Caribbean blue is one of those
moments where goosebumps all through
your body so have a look at this fun
setting over the hill behind me when I
stop talking the only sound that was a
waterfall
Oh
yeah
their staff
that the tree
the king
 me
maybe Andy
good morning so we are on the road again
we had meme from most peaceful night
sleep last night how well did you sleep
going yeah it was that it was yeah it
was done let me good job yeah it was so
crazy I know I kept saying it last night
but even at like 11:45 midnight when we
got to the particular a logical to lock
him I don't know I'll leave the name of
the accommodation Domino's and Airbnb
there was incredible
she candidly was so it didn't get out in
stayed it's kind of like moonlit night
thing all the way through the night
which is incredible China had a mega
line we can wake up until 8:30 which is
so unlikely I'm blaming the jet lag
our giant Achilles is down the most
peaceful nicely for the penises no noise
he woke them up and driving all those
words or yeah you're quite a good one
here filling up on the Red Bull and
coffee today I wrecked remarkable but
after a lovely breakfast a full
scholarship prior we'd a little bit of
drone footage over lakes and over the
house and then we drove just 10 30
minutes to a nearby beach and it was out
be stunning like powdery white sand
turquoise waters
you see people and now I'm not sure why
we're heading how do you know we don't
that places a guy recommended from the
B&amp;amp;B that you know that we get amazing
shots of caught nothing
- that's a tan think it's probably going
to be another six or so hours on the
road today and then factory
never been wrong with anyone never been
with anyone
my fellow
what's on your
children
there's a
you know
you even met
jeez
hello again we are back in the car and
this time we have typed in an interest
that now is going to take us just over
two hours you should be there twenty
five five so we just had lunch at this
incredible restaurants highly recommend
if you're ever in the highlands called
kyle scoop correctly Carlos you I don't
know everywhere that we visited will be
linked in the description box or
actually I will link Charlie's blog post
because he's going to be doing like man
about town guide to the whole little
world over the way back then yeah sort
of a guys yeah it's really done that's
the only food place on really yeah so
yes they're on route to internet it just
started to spit with rain a little very
lucky so far that we've had to do these
guys what these signs up just started
writing like that they were saying oh
yeah so tell everybody why you calling
them really well yeah well I bet it
works I think I'm just saying this but I
actually fall in love it
I guess also could fly for but it's not
where big clunky 4x4 yeah it's quite
nippy and it's actually pretty quick and
then why fall in love and it is all the
tech but I it's quite simple but
understandable the fan out for one is
easily the best I have we'd used in a
long time
it's normally cause that maps are a
little bit crampons and yeah on top of
that the sound system is amazing as you
probably heard about service
and for Jason to invest those which
countries are on the front of the car I
like to set up shop
yes nice vehicle and its got like a
hotel group yes got hydraulic boosters
are discussed burn another beaker off
shine above and top of me because I
originally said I wasn't confident
driving a big car like this because I
wouldn't have parking basically but
Tyrion is why would be confident driving
their skirt it's got rear view cameras
so as soon as you put the kind to remote
and into reverse it shows you what's
behind you and it showed you like the
line to guide you into a parking space
and all those and I'd be worried about
crushing into things but it has this
like shifting functions where you don't
have to I don't think it's automatic
again Venus's so is from as Charlie's
amount does you fear slightly into the
side of like the grass or something ages
and lunging you back into the tracks
which is amazing so yeah very impressed
five star master for this unofficial car
really great because we are debating
whether to get a regular car a 4x4 army
in London not 4x4 in a way a little bit
excessive
however with the dogs and if you want to
do weekender what weekend's away yeah
4x4 gives you that extra and I mean the
amount of boot space as well you can
pretty much you know 20 rooms a deck
spending interested cases and I'm yeah
tell me about did you know fun fact my
teachable is to have 17 sausage dog
school so many silver jokes that when I
open the door they have to kind of pile
on some people have their own car yeah
and notice to get down the corner each
other individual is yeah it'll be awhile
bedecked and again some Donald's about
to get April to manage all 17 their
faces
yeah we are offering German s
independence of just opens it is raining
quite 70 now we have been driving and
I'll show you some views because you
know me can't help that a good few shot
the next time I see you
okay so we have reached the end of our
journey
Charlie and I are now at Inverness train
station and we're about to get on the
Caledonian sleeper train which I'm very
intrigued by we're going in first class
but I think that doesn't means that we
get a bunk bed to ourselves which should
be exciting say the least so I will show
you very briefly what our pond looks
like and and then that's the end of our
final adventure
oh okay so Joey and I have had a
beginner
we both had macaroni cheese boards of
sleeper train I am now going to take my
makeup off put on my night cream and I
think China somehow I'm just going to
watch a movie
we've got into joining rooms now so they
opened up the guy came and opened up the
door in between our rooms so we can just
wave at each other in bed because it's
better definitely not big enough for the
two of us so I guess this is it I hope
you guys enjoyed our Scottish adventure
it was just so incredible to see the
highlands and such a pleasure to drive
around in the pasture so thank you
master for making it possible if you
guys enjoyed this video then please do
