I've got so many fun things going on
today it's a pretty manic one for a
Sunday I thought I would vlog and share
it with you because it's gonna be one of
those days I'm going to want to look
back on and remember what fab and
memorable time we had so this morning we
woke up bright and early it's a gorgeous
day today and I didn't want to waste the
opportunity to film so behind me a
little sneak peek to my filming setup
I've got my camera set up on a tripod
I've got my laptop resting on our
everlasting roses and I finally figured
out how to actually see what's on my
camera screen it starts making my
filming at life a lot easier
so I filmed a handbag unboxing video
this morning which I don't think will be
live yet when you watch this but keep a
lookout for that because oh my goodness
I'm just so smitten with the handbag
that I just unboxed um so yeah today I'm
gonna film one more video this morning
got to make the most of this gorgeous
weather and then I'm heading in to Soho
I'm doing a bit of a kind of meet-up
kind of fashion tips blogging advice
chat with hopefully some of you guys I
hope someone's gonna come otherwise that
could be a little bit awkward that's in
Soho later on twelve till two and then
tonight tonight is gonna be absolutely
amazing so it's the fifth of November
today remember remember fifth of
November and we have an incredible
evening lined up we're going to the
shard for a once-in-a-lifetime
experience put on by booking calm
if you don't know booking calm is it's a
website where you can book hotels they
have thousands and thousands of hotels
all across the world I always use them
when I'm traveling it's just great to
get low prices it's great to see all the
hotel options often you can book and
then you can cancel and you don't get
any penalization whenever Charlie and I
go on a trip I always use booking calm
but yeah so tonight we're going to the
shard with them the shard is obviously
the highest building in London and we'll
have the best view of all the fireworks
going off and we're going to be staying
the night there in an exclusive little
room that booking.com have put on they
built a hotel room at the top of the
shard so it's going to be an amazing
evening I'm looking forward to taking
you along to that so first of all I'm
gonna get that second video filmed and
I'll catch up with you guys on my way
into Soho
got back home again I'm not sure how
much I managed to capture a second ago
but I just spent the past few hours at
these so fragrance pop up having a
really nice chat about blogging about
fashion I met a few of you guys I did
have some people turnout which was great
it's a really lovely afternoon and then
I popped in to Zara got a few bits for
our trip to New York we're heading there
tomorrow morning
and so I thought I would show you what I
bought in Zara I was actually going in
there to look for some brown suede
leggings similar to my Rover iron ones
which I'm wearing right now and I didn't
see them on the stores a little bit
manic bit of a mess as it always is but
I did get some lovely pieces let me show
you what I did bye
okay so the first thing is this dress
it's very similar to one that you may
have seen in my how to style autumn
trends lookbook a little while ago I
absolutely love that dress fine it's so
versatile this one is pretty much the
exact same design but slightly darker
material it's black floral got a little
slip inside it so it should be nice to
wear with over knee boots with a nice
shearling jacket perhaps it's meant to
be quite chilly in New York so I'll
probably take a black thermal to wear
under this to kind of like midi-length
so hopefully I can get away with wearing
maybe black tights black boots but
that's really lovely work then I got
this blouse I thought this looked kind
of Zimmerman asked and I thought I could
wear this with maybe one of my corduroy
skirts or a midi skirt but whites with
these right autumnal kind of floral
designs nice little time on the sleeves
a little bit of lace and frill around
the neckline so yes so that was really
really pretty then I got a gray felt
skirt now this is really elasticated so
hopefully it'll be a really nice fit the
video I published this morning about
open e boots I said that something that
I was looking for was a gray felted
skirt too wearing my gray over me boots
so when I saw this I thought it was the
exact perfect thing almost like kind of
schoolgirl square design but really nice
for autumn/winter
another dress in the exact same design
as that first one this one is black with
red and orange floral
it's also got some kind of brown more
textured felt material in there as well
I find this style of dress very
versatile very easy to just fling on and
now you've got an instant good outfit so
I'll be getting a lot of use out of
those too
and then last but not least a pair of
tassel earrings I have been wearing
tassel earrings so much lately I just
loved their very statement and impactful
but not heavy on the ears so I got this
black and gold pair which I thought
would be nice for evenings in New York
maybe with the dresses that I just
showed you these were $9.99 so very
affordable way to just add something a
little bit more jazzy to my outfits so
my little minis are a haul I am now
going to pack my pieces for New York
we're only going for three days so
probably just pre-plan every outfit get
it all laid out and then pack it all up
okay I'm in my dressing gown now as I
have been trying on outfits for New York
and just not quite ready to commit for
what I'm wearing tonight yet so can't be
bothered to get dressed and them that I
thought I would show you my kind of
tactics when it comes to preparing a for
a short trip like this one as I said a
minute ago and I like to pre-plan all my
outfits it just actually saves a lot of
stress while you're away because you
don't need to think about your outfits
because you've only got set pieces so
what I've got on the floor behind me is
my various outfit so what I've been
doing is I've been looking through my
wardrobe choosing like a key piece for
example my Club Monaco pleated skirt and
then I try on a few bits and bobs and
then when I'm happy with an outfit I
take a photo in the mirror on my phone
and then when I am abroad I can just
take my phone and if I'm having a bit of
a lazy morning don't know what to wear
then I can just go to my camera roll I'm
trying to get it up to show you I can
just go to my camera roll and then here
are all the outfits that I've already
photographed and prepared ready for
packing I've tried to mix and match as
much as possible so like that pair of
boots will go with this outfit as well
I've taken I'm taking three boots with
me two over knee boots in black and gray
then I got my little ankle boots and I
think that's all the footwear I'm taking
with me actually these will be my comfy
walking shoes we've got a couple of
outfits here for the evenings as well my
River Island skirt and restock
combination and use our address and I've
got one evening that I haven't prepared
for but I think because we're going to
New York with Kate Spade I think they
might be gifting us an outfit for one of
the evenings so I've left that left that
to chance and then I also planned the
outfits right down to the bags so I've
got my new gorgeous little Chloe bag and
then this Michael close one is what I've
been using is like my everyday handbag
nice and roomy inside and then actually
underneath my Chloe bag these are just a
couple of miscellaneous pieces I've got
my really nice chunky Marks and Spencers
thermal and then these are a few pieces
I've just been really enjoying wearing
lately so these are my Zara faux leather
leggings and Club Monaco little feathery
GLA so I think that's pretty much my
entire New York wardrobe I am taking
three coats though which is what's going
to take up most of my suitcase I'll
probably wear this one to travel because
it's the most chunky and then a Reese
one this is from last year absolutely
love this very smart designed and then
my Karen Millen camel coat seems a bit
excessive I could probably get away with
just one but I thought when taking
pictures out and about the coat is a bit
you're going to see the most so I
thought I would take three hopefully
these two will pack down into a fairly
small size
so it is seven o'clock now and we are on
our way to the shard for our evening at
the top to watch the fireworks with
booking.com I think we are going to the
view from the shard area which is pretty
much the very very top you've been
before to the view at the show are you
dying
yeah I won't be died huh am I going dad
laughs you must be buddy it must be a
year or so going on yes amazing it's
pretty special
yeah so I think the order of the evening
is we arrive now we get shown up to our
kind of room setup this isn't something
that it's like open to the public it's
something that booking.com organized as
a really special kind of
once-in-a-lifetime experience so there's
only gonna be a very small group of us
they're not real hotel rooms they've
been put on just for tonight it's kind
of showcase creativity is yeah come have
some of the most creative creatively
designed rooms available well they're
like the global leaders in accommodation
and travel so they're there showing off
your amazing rooms they can do we've
just pulled up so I will take you guys
up to the top
okay so we've just come up to the
viewing platform level at the top of the
shard and as we got to the very top we
could see the southern fireworks going
off in the distance hopefully you'll
just seen a clip which is just amazing
seeing them from above but now as you
can see behind me we are in our room
this has been built by booking comm they
felt this just for this evening and it's
just absolutely incredible this is our
view I think we are in the north-facing
room and behind me you have a look at
the view you can see you've got London
Bridge fireworks going off away in the
distance over there and then we've got
this really scrumptious looking double
bed cozy up in later and I think we have
some miss bulbs on the bed for us as
well we've got an iPad to watch the
movies later little box full of I mask
earplugs
there's an amazing
so we've now come up to the next level
up and this is where we're going to be
having our dinner overlooking this
incredible view we're just talking that
to you the other guys sit here we
figured out everything we do tonight is
going to be the highest meal in Western
Europe or the five-foot shelf in Western
Europe because we'll see the view at the
shard is basically as high as you can go
and like the whole of Western Europe
which is pretty insane so this is what
dining experience is gonna look like
tonight we have this real Island which
is a table got the most amazing menu
lined up
so behind me charlie is about to do a
virtual reality where he's gonna put a
headset on and what he's gonna see in
his puzzle was in the so he's walking a
gangplank off the edge of the shard
so he's got a fear of heights you put
yourself up for this darling there's no
danger here
yeah
so right now we are at the very very top
of the shot if you were to look at the
shard you can kind of see where it looks
like actual shards of glass like it's
open at the top that's where we are at
the moment so if I look up it's actually
just like fresh open air so cool how is
your VR experience honestly that's the
best bit
yeah the headset because we've done it
before haven't we I like it a few
different things but this is so real
yeah it's really realistic quite scary
I feel like P Diddy it my nice furry
coat against your makes the Josephine
not like Dexter in Dickie
so we've just come downstairs downstairs
level 69 after our experience on the
viewing platform at the very top of the
shard we both had to go on the virtual
reality sets there's a slide and a
vertigo we have to like climb this
banister at the very top of the shard
both really really cool
definitely recommend them if you ever
come to the top now we're gonna get into
our pajamas and we're gonna get into our
beds bed with a view I just can't get
over this bedroom so this is rather
surreal I'm going to take my makeup off
now I've got my toiletry bag with me and
this is the view from the bathroom
use our shiny faces we have just put
Elizabeth Arden ceramide capsules on we
are now in bed booking.com
have pre-loaded an iPad with Netflix
stop it pre-loaded an iPad with Netflix
so we are going to have an evening
enjoying the movies with this incredible
view in the background so I'm gonna see
you guys in the morning
like a mole
my boyfriend the most epic out is Friday
night how I'm all game before this day

friends
