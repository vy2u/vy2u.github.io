vlog so I haven't started vlogging like
this until now but as you saw I had a
couple of fun meetings in town today and
I am now in the shangri-la hotel up on
the 40th floor of the shard and we are
here with Elizabeth Arden and they've
just given us a presentation which you
saw a couple of snippets of for their
new product launch which I'm going to be
explaining and using and showing you a
little bit later but for now so we've
just checked into our hotel room and it
is amazing so I'm gonna give you a
Whizzer on the hotel room to show you
how stunning it is firstly let's just
take a look I hope you know not Charlie
although he's not a bad for you I guess
but this bad boy oh so this is the room
view can see some pools you can see the
train station can see the london eyes
i'm where over there but more excitingly
well depending on your priorities
there's some little macaronis oh my gosh
oh are you yep I've got my eye on the
purple one but my eye on the purple one
haha
fight your pirate that one's for Dexter
and that speech all of them no I want
let's have half of one each no yes
anyway we have a sparkling champagne by
Lauren Perrier and the cup what is
thought Liz it's not in focus but it's
beautiful we have a little welcome card
I heart Juicy Couture fragrance a few
zoom yes that's the bag for the
fragrance boo we even got some
binoculars hmm we can spy on people and
we can spy on the little people down
there we also have a few more goodies in
the room for most but ardent and they
are boiling up so I have a bag from ray
feather which I'm not gonna lie I'm
extremely excited about the curve it's
the pom-poms on it and my name and you
know having up anything personalised so
I love it and inside is the new product
which is this bad boy so they are
launching the provide and provide is
kind of like the slightly and it has to
explain it maybe they like smarter
slightly more expensive up arrange for
Elizabeth Arden and this is their new
city smart moisturizer kind of
moisturizer but you apply it after your
moisturizer it's an environmental shield
and they were basically just showing us
in the presentation about how London is
so polluted more polluted than New York
more polluted than Madrid than Paris and
LA so really scary stuff and it was
basically showing us how pollution
particles go into the skin as easily as
a nickel goes into a basketball hoop
that's how easily pollution gets into
our skin but with this bad boy it will
create a shield on your skin so you will
be safe from the nasties in the city on
that note I need to get out of the city
ASAP
it's gross what the city is doing twice
skin don't you think darling how about a
countryside
we're doing weekend in Vista a weekend
is not enough we need to ruin dicks
destroy the house yeah
we do need to move to the countries that
I know you anyway so let me carry on
showing you the room we have the world's
poshest water bottle don't know why I'm
so excited about this but I am is a
class yes and the little fox Charlie's
got his toilet trees look at him have
you ever known a man trees so anyway let
me show you the bathroom this is the
bathroom I'm secretly quite glad that
it's not like on the edge because I
heard that some of the bathrooms in here
you can see into next door's bathroom
and I'm not keen on any nudity sharing
look at this so my name hi Josie let
outsmart the city tonight my name is on
the window this is crazy we have a TV in
the mirror and a clock down there I
could do parma toiletries oh my god have
you ever known a hotel to have awkward
apartment toiletries and then we have
some Elizabeth Arden Prevage products
here this is their Super Start skin
renewal booster moisturizer anti aging
overnight cream definitely going to
slather that on tonight and then I think
this is their anti-aging and intensive
repair daily serum which looks very
snazzy
this toilet has a heated seat and on one
of these buttons how crazy is that
powder deodorizer let's press it no
don't do anything don't know how to make
it work so basically this is the
snazziest hotel room I have ever seen
and the hotel has a pool up on the 52nd
floor so we're gonna go there right now
okay so it's about half an hour later
after my lovely swim and I just had a
very quick outfit change and quick hair
blow-dry and makeup update now on the
way to dinner or actually were going for
cocktails first at aqua chard which is
next door I will give you an outfit of
the day when I find somebody who can
fill my outfit
so yes excited for cocktails
friends idea
good morning if I thought I would make
this into a two day clock because we are
spending the morning short I mean
today and
most distressing day and mountain so I'm
not sure that much of the article but
firstly to come look at this view behind
me which is our breakfast surely joining
us for breakfast it was late last night
I think here the girls didn't get back
until like three o'clock I think I was
pretty upset by what we do bad so we're
just having a strong coffee and agreeing
to you fixed up
I wonder where we're sitting just follow
Charlie boy
we've gone you know
Charlie's been healthier boys healthy a
shilling nice and full my wonderful
breakfast and our next stop today is
because we've got a wedding on Saturday
hey guys so I'm trying to do this Baba
something because I'm coming out Hotel
in the restaurant and there are people
everywhere so I'm hoping people are
going to think that I'm just talking to
my webcam or something so anyway thought
I'd quickly catch up Charlie and I had a
few like blog meetings today
ever since Charlie's been like paying
attention to it since around his blog
we've been having a few joint meetings
are just quite fun
so we got him a suit from Los bras and
then we meant went to meet Bradley from
some girls hurt and let me show you my
new sunglasses because they are
literally the most beautiful things in
the whole world they are from Prada and
yeah I have been lusting over the years
oh my god dropping him all over the
place I've been lusting at these for so
long look I love them so much I cannot
wait the next sunny day to wear them
because yeah he's pretty much lodged in
my half an hour and then I've been in
the pan yard hotel for the past two
hours I had lunch here and I met another
girl for a meeting and now I'm just in
time I thought maybe like two hours just
to kill some time before dinner tonight
going out for dinner with ripple at
Shoreditch house which should be great
fun I've never even been rich as before
but I'm dying soon it's like because I
just had the most amazing things cam
throughout today but I just update you
I'm going to hopefully
maybe potentially start editing in this
video because I want it to go live
tomorrow so if you're watching this on
Thursday it means that we're successful
so I'm going to get back to some work
and I will very briefly show you a
shortage house a little bit later I'm in
the left and I'm so not cool enough for
shortage house I can already feel it
not dressed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
