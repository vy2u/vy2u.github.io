Toba video today's video is going to be
a little bit more chilled out because
I've actually already done all my work
for the day it's midday but judging from
the sky outside you'd think it was like
6:00 p.m. it's so dull today but I spent
the morning and actually in bed just
doing a load of emails and some editing
and some scheduling so very very
productive morning and now I have pretty
much done most of my work so I thought
I'd pick up the camera and we can have
quite a nice chilled afternoon together
just made myself a cup of tea and I had
an early lunch you guys saw me making a
pea and pesto pasta with brown rice
pasta earlier so nice and healthy
extremely filling I am absolutely full
to the brim and as I was making it the
doorbell rang and I received two very
exciting deliveries today some of my tea
down my first exciting delivery of the
day was this incredible bunch of flowers
you can see next to me this incredible
big white bouquet they came from the PR
girls at Clinique which is just so so
generous of them to say thank you for
working on a campaign with them and
they're just so beautiful
yeah almost wish I wasn't going away
this weekend so I could spend more time
more time with the flowers that's really
weird isn't it yes anyone else get like
that but I'd love to make the most out
of flowers and shoot blog photos with
them so I'm gonna have to do that
tomorrow morning instead last night was
quite a late one I actually was out
later than I have been in quite a long
time I went out with a blogger friend
Katie whose blog is kalanchoe I'll leave
that link down below and we were at the
bar until at last orders which if you
guys know me you'll know is not like me
at all so yeah quite a while one last
night for me although we did end it with
a cup of matcha tea and anyway so the
other exciting delivery is upstairs and
and it's a little bit larger than the
bunch of flowers and I'm really excited
to try it out so let me show you what
it's all about so here we are the second
exciting delivery that came today not
Dexter you didn't get delivered today
did you muscle surge look how interested
he is silly boy but it's actually what
is behind it so this box here you would
not believe it but there is actually a
king-size mattress in here I'm intrigued
to see how this comes out because I I
just can't fathom a full-size mattress
being in a box that big although it is a
pretty big box when you look at it like
that oh I put this in my head come
upstairs and forgot to take it out again
so yeah this is basically a new king
sized mattress that Charlie and I have
ordered we are slowly but surely going
around the house and making upgrades and
investments to each of the rooms and we
thought we'd start with the bedroom well
actually we already started with the
kitchen but we'll just glide over that
bit we thought the next place that we
needed to improve would be our bedroom
because obviously we spend half our life
in bed and at the moment I've been as
you guys know really into like
well-being wellness and part of that is
getting a good night's sleep I actually
upgraded or updated my phone the other
day and they now have a app where it
tells you when you need to go to bed to
get the right amount of sleep so
everyone is cottony on to this whole
sleep being incredibly incredibly
important and I for one cannot function
unless I've had a good night's sleep and
recently China I have just not been
getting the best night
choice always complaining that our
mattress is too firm so we thought we
would get a new one and instead of going
through the awkward process of going to
different stores and to be honest we
live in central London so that aren't
even really many beds stores and You
Only Live but when we got our first two
mattresses it was just like this whole
ordeal of lying on the beds and just a
very awkward experience basically so we
got this one online from Lisa and what I
really liked about them is that they
have the big charity ethos so if every
ten mattresses they sell they give one
to charity and they reach
donated a load to a charity of a
Manchester and they also plant a tree
very match result it's a really really
lovely company and also for Charlie and
I we chose them because they are a
luxury mattress company like they are
very good quality mattresses they have
three layers of foam that keeps your
body cool while you're sleeping and
obviously like molds to your body shape
so incredibly comfortable but more than
that they're luxury but they beg because
they're an online store they don't have
the expenses of a shop or of sales
assistance so they're about a third of
the price of other luxury mattresses so
we did our research and hopefully it's
going to be just absolutely wonderful
I'm very very excited to get out the box
and Charlie has just come home as you
might be able to hear he's on the throne
at the moment being very loud so I'm
going to enlist his help in putting it
on the bed so let's do this we can do
we can't go
with me join me in my god
oh so Charlie is about cut open at noon
vacuum as you can see at the moment it's
pretty much like a flat mattress and
immediately just cut it and you can see
it expanding that is insane
so apparently it's going to take about
ten minutes until it's fully inflated
it's already absolutely massive compared
to when we got it out the box so I'm
going to go and finish editing today's
video and when I come back it's going to
be full size mattress so I'm coming back
in ten minutes later and oh my god
firstly it is so dark I feel like it's
pretty much midnight it's crazy how long
the evenings are getting and but
excitingly look how fat this mattress
has become and our bed is even like
hiding half of it the bed frame but I'd
say that's like I don't know 15 inches
it's absolutely plumpify ditz self which
is just incredible when you think that
it was vacuum packed a few minutes ago I
don't know how they do it's actually
insane look at this alright so squidgy
so I'm excited to try this out tonight
it's been well since forever since we've
lived here that we've not really had a
proper mattress so be interesting to see
how it affects our quality of sleep and
China were just discussing I think we
were going to go out and have a nice
meal out and go to cinema tonight but
instead we're going to put the mattress
to the test and that sounds really dodgy
by having a movie night in bed and doing
face masks not what you are thinking of
though we're going to go out now and get
some food maybe go to Marks &amp;amp; Spencer's
and get some of their you know bundles
which I love and come back here stick on
some face masks I might even do like a
full facial experience that I am hot
water water on the shoulders that type
of thing and just enjoy in my lovely new
soft mattress
Oh
like us
I just got back from Brixton I didn't
take my camera with me because I knew
I'd have a lot to carry on the way home
we've got our old mattress in this room
for now that's the only problem is how
to get rid of your old mattress so Oh
Dexter we're just going to leave this
mattress in here until someone collects
it from us from Gumtree but I went to
dawdle and I wasn't planning on showing
you my vlog amounts and I've been doing
that too much recently but something
rather incredible is here so let me show
you this this is the most insane
delivery from Smashbox and it is their
be legendary 120 lipsticks like how
crazy is this I'm so excited to try
these there are some gorgeous colors
here liking the look of these like
neutral ones and then there's a coral
one and they've also put an instrument
lipstick transformer in there but
seriously this is absolutely crazy let
me have a look and see how the lipsticks
themselves look so you've got the
classic packaging oh that is insane I
might give it a little try now actually
okay I just applied the shade callback
which I thought this is like beautiful
light coral a very wearable coral color
and first of all I have to say I am very
impressed with the formula that really
bar me but still a really good color
payoff obviously the rest my makeup is a
little bit crap right now so don't judge
me but first impressions are very very
good it's not excited to try out a few
extra of these shades I mean I have
plenty to choose from
look how insane that is actually crazy
how many they sent me and then also just
quickly in my blogger mail from today
there's a charcoal detoxifying face
wipes from yes - and a new moisturizer
creme Kashmir oh that sounds lovely face
lifting soft cream we've also got a
little box from Bourjois that I don't
actually know it's inside so let's open
this up and have a little look
ooh the Christmas collection Parris
grande sheep wow that is amazing oh my
gosh look at these they like eye pencils
brow duo oh I like the sound of that
and then we've got their highlight
Scott lived loads of these browse eros
oh that looks nice
a new black liner an incredible red
Rouge Edition velvet and oh gosh and a
smoky eye palette which I cannot enter
with one hand how luxurious in that box
is so so so beautiful Thank You
bourgeois also got this lovely little
bag from the body shop so let's see what
they put inside I think it's like a load
of Christmas makeup pieces loads of
beautiful brushes wow these look
stunning gosh I like this color in
particular a matte lip liquid oh I like
the sound of that definitely give that a
try it soon and then we've got a few
eyes shadow cords or need to get the
packaging off that whole little look wow
these are so beautiful on my gosh once
again I have just totally been spoilt
and then last but not least there's a
this is a new brand actually so I think
it's from the founders of soap &amp;amp; Glory
but this is their pure brand so super
duper I've got a body wash and a body
lotion and they're paraben free
fragrance free I think lemme see the
press release said no microbeads no
parabens some of them are in recycled
plastic so a very feel-good brand and
the packaging is so so cute so I'm
looking forward giving those a try the
lots of lovely bloggers mail I think
Charlie and I are going to head out in a
few minutes to honest burger our
favorite place and grab a burger and
then as I mentioned we're going to come
back here and have a nice pamper evening
enjoy our new mattress have a very very
early night because both of us didn't
really get to bed much before midnight
last night because as I mentioned I had
wild one on the porn star martinis so
yeah gonna be a nice chilled or tunnel
evening so I was just dismantling the
smash box box because I didn't need to
keep it with its lipstick tray in it and
look there's another second tray under
the top tray so we have a whole oh my
god I literally don't even know how many
lipstick sisters but also look at this
bottom row I think I'm in love with
every single color this is actually
insane
what am I going to do it all these
lipsticks I feel like I'm going to have
to do a giveaway this is a very special
moment because it is my first outing of
my Gucci dialysis bag which you may have
seen my unboxing in a very recent video
so it's the first time that I'm taking
it out because today is when I filmed
that video
it definitely does not go with my outfit
I'm wearing the Ted Baker floor jumper
they picked up at McArthur Glen so I've
got double flower action going on with
the bag and the jumper and then I'm
wearing my Navy jeans which are American
Eagle and just some trainers because
we're only going down the road for
casual burger so no need to dress up too
smart you know Josh a poncho to hurt you
how's your day been darling doctor what
are you done um I believe the life of a
blogger tonight yeah bricks it's
breakfast weird L'Oreal is Charlotte
which was really nice yeah um love love
Oreos goodies that she's giving me um
what does Jules press day yeah met
another sausage dog I agree that we need
sausage and dachshund revolution I'm
going to leave it at the Army's source
of silks did he get Dexter any present
yeah Dexter's got a personalized scarf
how many likes I don't know he's gonna
watch this a surprise we won't let him
watch it again you're getting Rebecca
tools bed as well you might have a scar
from away ah
what else
I'll also enter rituals and picked up
some stuff in there and did you know
fact the reason is inspired by the
samurai the samurai you for shape I'll
show you and wash their face before
battle so they do their hair like a
ritual and before battle is that what it
is that's where the rituals concept
comes from so actually it's all about
male grooming more than ice cream and
actually the products are quite cool
like that is if you think about it
before work your butt giannis before you
do battle on the northern line yeah I
feel like I'm pumped up before I do that
so no that was really cool learn a bit
more background and lots of exciting
posts coming boy what's your blog
darling man about town me
don't you think Charlie is good on
camera we need to persuade him to surf
zone teach you channel what you reckon
darling cook maybe it might be longdesc
leave a comment saying Charlie dollar
YouTube channel if you think that you've
got on camera exciting interest or Kings
on
what does
back home again after our evening out at
honest burgers we both are in a little
bit of a food coma but that didn't stop
us from going to Waitrose where we've
got pink ring doughnuts for 10p absolute
bargain and Charlie Connie went to
larger ate earlier got me some macaroons
so we're going to have a face mask and
pamper evening while indulging ourselves
also very excited to try out our new
mattress I'm getting into bed for the
first time in it feels a lot firmer than
our old one that is for sure so I am
pampering with a with the L'Oreal clay
face mask multi-masking I've got the
dark charcoal one for detoxifying my
blemish areas and then the white clay
one for purifying the rest of my face
and Charlie is going to be using a dirty
workz moisturizing sheet mask because he
wanted to just have a little moisture
injection
well I guess the true test will be how
we feel when we wake up in the morning
because both chai and I have been
getting a bit of back ache recently from
our old one so hopefully this might do
the trick and we'll wake up feeling pain
and ache free so we're gonna now watch
some of the missing or strange things I
can't talk charlie Kahn talks face mask
is too small his face and go to bed have
an early night so I'll catch up with you
guys tomorrow morning
good morning it's Friday morning now
half past 9:00 and Charlie and I are up
and ready to go feeling fresh as a daisy
as we had such a good night's sleep last
night on our new mattress it was I was
pleasantly surprised by how comfort it
was really quite firm and Charlie said
because I'm like I don't like sink into
it like normal people would do and but
yeah so we are heading out to my mum's
house now we're going to Gloucester for
the weekend so I'll take you guys with
me although I'm not sure when you'll see
this video because Wi-Fi in Gloucester
is not that good glass shows not that
good it's gonna be a fun weekend though
seeing my brother and his wife and their
children and this little sausage is
coming with us as well so we've got an
hour rush to get the train so I shall
see you a little bit later how was your
night sleep Dexter mmm it was okay but I
mean I'd rather sleep in your bed
because I don't like it downstairs it
soon oh yes and your beds really
comfortable
I need a bro I need a brother and he's
coming yes Delisa make memory foam
mattresses for dog beds cuz I'd quite
like to put my name on the waiting list
yes
so we made it back to Gloucester it's so
funny when I come back here because this
is where I used to live and mom sold the
house a couple years ago so it's always
quite a strange sensation coming back
like it's all really familiar but so
strange because it's not my home anymore
and now I start it really weird yeah we
just stopped for petrol and we're going
to a garden center because they're
having a closing down cells and one's
like all got to get some plants 20 of
sent-off so might have a bit of a garden
center hall for you guys in a second
Dexter has been so good throughout this
whole journey he's just so so
well-behaved aren't you my little
cottage and then we're meeting my bro
and his family and we're going to get a
Sunday roast which I'm so excited about
starving hungry and so yeah a roast is
definitely what's on the cards and it is
so gorgeous today it's been absolute
oaring with rain this morning but now
it's blue skies absolutely beautiful
you
mom and I picked up two pots and two
plants from the garden center and we've
now come to a place called Wilton Court

Jonah's Kilimanjaro it's a mountain in
Africa it's the world's highest
freestanding volcano Mount Everest no
freestanding it's not part of mountain
ranges we got Dexter here but he is not
allowed in the restaurant so we're just
gonna take him for a few ways and then
