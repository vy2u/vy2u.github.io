Abu Dhabi vlog so you guys know my
challenge for starting vlogs in the
weirdest of places and I think today's
vlog is starting in the most amazing of
all places can you guess where I am
I am in the SD card Innovation Center
checking out their new airplane which is
pretty much the biggest airplane in the
world it is their new a380 is
double-decker all the way across and
it's pretty surreal being in here we
just have to pass so many security
clearances to get in here had to provide
our passport we had to go through
security checks and we're now in the
top-secret hangar feels like area 51 I'm
hoping I'm even allowed to vlog in here
so hopefully as well be the world's
shortest log but can you even see how
biggest anus
I wanna fight as a beautiful I want to
I wanna platinum go since we're on board
the Airbus a380 which the Etihad have
kitted out this is the biggest airplane
in the world I'm currently standing in a
first-class cabin which as you can see
behind me is a fairly spectacular unlike
any parents you don't ever seen before
my sweltering place but then the
entertainment systems on which is why
it's about 40 degrees on this aeroplane
right now and behind me so this is the
first-class cabin go inside you can see
this massive seat like this is an
airplane seat it's ginormous
and then there's pretty much a five
person long sofa on the other side
I've got a widescreen TV over here so
cool and it's all this like plush very
luxurious down there I've got my own
little handheld system I can control the
TV on there game are gone right decide
what movies are gonna watch seriously
snazzy and then down here is on my
electrical gadgets and gizmos so what
else do we got that's how little explore
if I'm traveling with someone and I can
just say hey because this is the next
cabin but so if you think this is cool
let me show you around the residence
which is the Etihad s a380s three room
cabin so there's only one on this plane
but there's not only a bedroom but also
a bathroom and the living room so this
is the living room area of the residence
you've got this sofa you've got this
incredible area against tainment system
oh my gosh humongous TV down here you've
got your very own bathroom in there and
then your very own private bedroom with
an actual bed inside this is absolutely
crazy
you can watch TV in your bed let's see
is it comfy well I can confirm that the
bed aboard the first-class compartment
the residents on the Etihad a380 is very
comfortable so even if you're not
staying in the residence and if you are
traveling in first-class you still get
insane facilities I'm just about to take
you into the bathroom so this is the
first-class bathroom it's very sleek
black this huge vanity cabinet look at
this open kimonos you've got this mother
of Health soap dispenser sink down here
and I believe somewhere we should have a
shower sink inside here oh my gosh so
many little cabinets in here it's like a
lettuce cake so here's an example the
first-class cabin if you are sharing
with a friend you can just leave this
whole area open so you can check your
pal while you're on the airplane it's
basically like the size of my entire
London flat and now we've come through
to business club so we've got one seat
on that side or is it - yeah one seat on
each window side and then two seats in
the middle and say our absolute I knew
must be get this huge desk area to sell
massive TV gosh so luxurious I mean it's
not by the residence but this is pretty
savvy is you beauties okay now I'm gonna
be really noisy and have a little look
Kru area so they've got a proper coffee
machine no instant coffee when you're in
business class oops
I was decade don't look at dunya
probably just economy down there I'm
going to stay up here so this is where
they prepare the food he's got a
microwave oven behind me trash compactor
- coffee machines all these cabinets
which I'm guessing are filled with
in-flight meals because this plane is
going to Mumbai tomorrow
I'm sure it's got lots of tasty meals if
you're traveling first or business or in
your residence then you can use this
fabulous area which is allowed would you
officially call it down fast love it
love it then you can use this Lobby area
which is like a circular seating area
and you can watch the chef who prepares
the meals in that galley to start so
basically I will be spending the whole
flight on our way home here for sure
having porn star martinis hopefully
there is a bar area behind me chilling
of wine just so luxurious I've just come
back into the first-class cabin it's
kind of lucky
again and I've just made a really cool
discovery so let me show you what is in
this slot car made and use my glue to
get other friends you're going to be
very excited
this is a candy-covered see but this
mirror it's not like storage for a
jewelry storage go make up products for
my god and how did you listening that is
command build this in my house
and for the rest of us mere mortals who
don't have a cool 20 grand to drop on a
flight here is economy which actually is
probably the best economy I think I've
ever seen
so that's having a look inside the seats
I mean they're not quite spacious but
they are very comfortable and you've got
actually a really big TV this is mercy
this is like a widescreen TV and you get
the same controller as you get in first
class so there's a bargain right there
got the table you got charging units you
even got a plug I've never seen a plug
in economy before this is like the UK
plug right here really spacious
so Etihad you've done well now I feel
that the residence with the Betsi in the
house now I'm about to take over
families the other
getting in the pilot deep oh my god
pilots like some way of life he's got a
sheepskin throw over his seats air
conditioning such a relief plane
baby I'm trying to think what else I can
show you we pretty much got the Alice
a380 all to ourselves
I mean I've shown you the shower I've
shown you the bathroom I've shown you
the Coxes I'm so much yeah I literally
showed everything the last thing to show
you in case you ever wondered like I
definitely did this is where the crew
sleep so this is actually not too
dissimilar to the first class
compartment feel but less noisy but this
is a pretty huge bed so this is where
this is where the app except okay so
share down there that Chile big bad a
chef Phillips probably like wow that was
a seriously cool experience I've just
come outside because it is roasting on
there as I think
five million times how cool is that I
just go check private or the Etihad as
US a380 so that is the biggest airplane
in the whole world
plain those I think I said a truth
London Abu Dhabi Sydney
by JFK I will leave all Etihad
information down below but this airplane
is absolutely fantastic we get to fly
home from Abu Dhabi on Sunday in
business cars and so excited we came out
on business class as well got a slightly
smaller airplane so ah such an amazing
plane I never thought I would get
excited about aeroplanes make
secret airplane door but that has got me
very excited how does this thing fly and
look how big this thing is
this is hot
heading back to the party now walking
underneath the wing of the a380 and I
have never felt smaller in my entire
life but pretty cool thing inside an
airplane hangar never somewhere I
thought I would find myself
I mean look I've been walking on this
wing for about thirty seconds down and
still not all the way through
place
