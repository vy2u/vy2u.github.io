that's what made me fall because you
Oh

so
crazy
and welcome to the Amalfi Coast Charlie
and I have just arrived in Sorrento and
bit of a dream being here we've kind of
seen it a lot Instagram on our wish list
it's been our wish list for so long so
we're here in staying in Sorrento flew
into Naples this morning and it's pretty
much exempted to be look at this view so
we wanted to escape from London and
enjoy a bit of a late summer holiday and
make the most of the last of the
sunshine escape the rain in England yeah
eat lots of pasta yeah I'm just enjoy
some time together we both have been
really busy over summer home away yeah
it's kind of non-stop in it it can be
when you like when you live with someone
it's it's easy to take that for granted
and when you get away with so with the
other week you're gonna say your loved
one and then you thought it was too
cheesy right you know we just thought
it'd be nice to have a real romantic
break and well it's more romantic than
where we can eat pizza pasta country
Italy is the country of love love is it
it isn't now it is now we're saying the
most beautiful hotel that we will show
you around over the next couple of days
we're just here for three days so I will
show you all around but for now we
hadn't early start so we aren't gonna go
and hit the pool and have a good old nap
smooch
and Charlie and I are feeling very much
refreshed after our little nap put by
the pool we had a nap and a coffee
so feeling much better after our very
early start this morning it's a
beautiful beautiful time of the evening
now it's that gorgeous temperature and
it's starting to turn into golden hour
John if you can see the lighting behind
me but it's just absolutely spectacular
we are just getting ready to go out for
dinner we're going on a bit of a date
night tonight having a bit of a romantic
meal we chose a really beautiful small
very romantic restaurants here in
Sorrento so just starting to get ready
for that I'll show you a few clips of my
getting ready routine but I think before
we go to the restaurant we're going to
go to the terrace of the restaurant I
was staying here hopefully get a really
beautiful view there take some shots in
that beautiful garden our lighting so
yes looking forward to a lovely romantic
evening
so I'm just about finished getting ready
I didn't take too long on my makeups
evening I don't like to spend too long
on holiday just get ready and enjoy the
evening it's that beautiful time of the
night now it's starting to get into
Golden Hour which is my favorite time of
day
so before I head out my finishing touch
for this evening is of course my
fragrance I have been absolutely loving
this one from DKNY recently it's next to
love it's their brand new luxury
fragrance and I think that if I wear it
on this holiday it'll always remind me
of this special trip whenever I wear it
in the future so I'm going to keep
spritzing myself with this throughout
the trip I describe it as floral and
fruity and it's also got natural
extracts of honey and neroli in there as
well neroli in particular I don't know
why but I always associate that
fragrance with Italy so it's the perfect
holiday to start wearing it and then as
I wear it over the next few weeks and
months I'll just always remember
memories from this trip so it'll be a
very very special fragrance for me
I wake up at your place wake up at mine
same question always I'm getting tired
we can have breakfast kinda you're Frank
boomers goes through the way
stop
why don't we just get
please together what is in our own so
much better balconies and bathtubs
watching one why don't we just get
together
good morning so it's our first full day
in Sorrento today first and only
actually this is a very short whirlwind
weekend getaway and China I just had a
delicious breakfast here at the hotel
we slept so well we're feeling very
well-rested and we're going to get in a
taxi ahead to Positano today it's a
little bit cloudy so we just thought
we're gonna make the most so going to
explore and just have a little look
around before we go I'm just gonna
quickly show you my outfit of the day
Charlie's busy packing his rocks I heard
behind me but you guys would have seen
this dress many times before I wore it
pretty much the whole time we were in
Provence and I absolutely loved it it's
just a perfect holiday dress so that's
what I'm wearing and then I've got this
lovely DKNY bag in this beautiful blush
leather which I'm obsessed with really
good size for a travel bag can wear over
my shoulder looking good darling I've
got my little gold flat shoes on they're
really nice because they're quite smart
but they also just are very comfortable
for Dave exploring and then I'm
finishing off my outfit with my
fragrance DKNY neck to love I wore this
one that last night as you know but it
works really nicely as a day fragrance
as well those honey notes nice and sweet
so finishing with a misting and we're
ready to go
so it's about four o'clock now Charlie
and I have spent the day just ambling
around positano looking around the shops
we've spent quite a lot of time
sheltering in cafes because tragically
it was actually torrential rainfall
today typically they've not had rain all
summer but we made the most we had a
really nice long leisurely lunch we had
some Prosecco we found an amazing place
for lunch just like looking over the
views everywhere in red oh yeah the
three-piece today Positano Prosecco
compostable we're gonna get boat now
back to Sorrento so you have another
lovely romantic dinner planned so it's a
couple of hours later now we have
dressed up for dinner another fairly
quick change we're very grateful that
the rain has stopped and blue skies are
back blue skies yeah so we're just gonna
have a little to tool around Sorrento
although we actually spot it a little bi
yes they didn't way on the way out it's
really lovely long drive and hopefully
we can get a little table there have a
glass of something one or two glasses
just before dinner we managed very very
luckily to get a table in the Michelin
star restaurant within our hotel tonight
so lovely way to spend our final evening
in a belly
stole that you don't want me
oh just golden
hold on to you
yes
pains you're perfect were kids
brain and this interesting
wandering around sorrento our final
morning here in italy we went down a
fisherman village it was really really
lovely had a nice lunch by the ocean

for pistachio ice cream so now we are
heading back home but we've had a fab
time had lots of relaxation time

of lovely memories and whenever I spritz
