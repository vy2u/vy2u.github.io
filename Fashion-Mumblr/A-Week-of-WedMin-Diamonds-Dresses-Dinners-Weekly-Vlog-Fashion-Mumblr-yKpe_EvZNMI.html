it's time to do something fabulous with
my house forever I love always been the
bird one ride and just to feel light
screaming dreaming feeling fire
hearts on fire I'm dripping dripping on
your pillows me and you I would catch up
with you very quickly this morning as
you've seen lots of really fabulous
events and I've just nipped in favorite
coffee very nice
now however I'm just about to meet
South's and we are going to going to D
two beers
pressing which I'm very excited about
obviously it's a brand it's very special
to me as my own engagement ring is two
beers so we're going to look at their
new bridal collection with existing
bridal collections and I'm gonna go and
find so so I'm with my darling was so
excited to see her oh my god through his
collection he'll ever having such a
lovely bride or themed week as you know
we had our shoot and we're doing some
exciting things on
so much to be revealed but yep so here
at beers group this is where I got my
engagement rings on and they have got a
beautiful floral arch on the wall look
at that ready to press space
I'm holding therefore must come some day
or not finally making here we have some
of the new collection these are the new
bridal rings so Fran I've just been
debating which ones are our favorites
this one is yet to be named but looks
remarkably similar to one a Meghan miles
ring absolutely beautiful and then we've
got this one here which is similar to
mine and it's got the beautiful halo the
aura style parlay around the band and
this one this one I feel is quite Art
Deco it's more of a square it's not sure
so there's a lot more the technicalities
than I do
come on then I'm not wearing my ring by
the way because just being re-signed by
the lovely ladies upstairs I'll get it
back looking extra sparkly in a second
of a beautiful design is the angel with
a split shank and a beautiful diamond in
the middle which is raised you can see
there which makes it extra sparkly eye
catches a light beautifully and then
you've probably spotted this one in the
background which is mine and sosa
favorite absolutely gorgeous so this is
a yellowy golden diamond in the middle
to be as only work with diamonds with
the pave or around the outside stunning
and then we have this lovely bracelet
which I just tried armor looks
incredible this many people may not have
seen this before this is diamonds in the
rough before they thin polished up to be
as have all different colored diamonds
these are a few gorgeous of that and
then we have got some of their more
affordable jewelry these are the
bracelets this one looks very similar to
my ring for a style and then this is a
rather spectacular necklace from the
archive collection
this is that feels almost like fabric
the way that it moves
Wow over 2,000 diamonds incredible last
but not least beautiful earrings keep
catching my eye catching the light so
stunning these again that have the pave
diamonds on them looking absolutely
divine so if now I've also just got some
candles personalized over here we can
get gorgeous and I've also had my
engagement ring sparkled up they have a
machine or a contraption in the store
which just puts all the all the dirt off
and makes it ultrasparc be again
looking wonderful we're gonna have
another look at the collection enjoy our
beautiful diamonds
the shades
sparkly wonder here 51 euros diamond
train movie worth over 10 million pounds
with a weighting give us a try Sookie
and I are being entrusted with some of
the largest diamonds in the store we're
going to go into the photo booth the one
that I'm gonna be wearing is fifty one
carat diamond on my finger not only 10
million only 1000 10 karats
always the same
we've come upstairs now and the aliens
showing us the for you forever service
at De Beers which is where you can
choose your diamond to create the
perfect engagement ring we're currently
seeing how she is pushing in the claws
after adjusting the size what kind of
ring would this we won't be the name of
this in this ring this is a De Beers
diamonds plain diamond classic named
diamond classic so this is how they look
before the diamonds get popped in so
lovely thank you
Sophie and I are now at the rest we're
having our teas and just debriefing on
our experience fact appears very
interesting to see there for you forever
service and we met the lady who actually
did my ring resizing and also did the
engraving inside my ring and many of you
guys know that's actually inside my
engagement ring I have the coordinates
of the island to our Charlie and I met
and where we got engaged yeah sweet this
is really lovely we realized we were
there for about two hours trying on
there Charlie's ring million oh my
goodness it's mind-blowing a
mind-blowing it's so incredible they
have they have different showstopper
pieces in there all the time so
sometimes they'll have huge diamond
rings sometimes don't have these amazing
Archive Collection necklaces which we've
also got to see so definitely worth
popping in for all of the sparkling
inspiration
and yeah we just I mean I sticky and
ketchup now then I'm gonna go and have
my lashes done ready for holidays and
then I think we're gonna have some
cocktails oh well yeah shall we shall we
cheers to that
hello again darlings it is now Saturday
morning I didn't film yesterday because
it was another working from home day the
right update you could leaks my face
probably looks a bit different from when
I last saw you so on Thursday afternoon
evening I went to get my lashes done
after the DeBeers event I had individual
lash extensions at a place in Soho
called lash perfect took about an hour
and a half to get the individual lashes
stuck on and I'm very very pleased to
the result because now I won't have to
wear mascara when I'm on holiday which
is super and then my brows are looking
very bushy and dark because last night I
used my oily or at-home dye brow kit to
dye them so they're pretty crazy right
now I feel like very opposite extremes
to have my hair colored and my eyebrows
darkened so I'm gonna get them threaded
later on today heading into town now

guest on today's vlog and we are
actually doing something very exciting

taking all of them except for my pair
and they are absolutely perfect
I also nipped in to mulberry and wreath
I'm going to show you what I got from a

I feel like it's the kind of coat that I
will wear so much over the next few
months especially perfect for spring and
summer as well and I'm definitely gonna
take it to Dallas with me and then I'm
gonna continue packing I was packing
last night so I'm carrying with that but
yeah before I finish the vlog I'm going
to show you my new coat I'm so sorry
about the messy surroundings but that is
what happens when you're getting ready
to go so this is my new coat I have to
undo this little stitch detail here so
that it flops open but it's like a
beautiful champagne colored I want to
say it's like a satin material but it's
definitely got a sheen to it I got a
size four if it's really perfectly on
the shoulders hey tell my young man are
you gonna climb in mommy's suitcase no
just gonna look at mommy sweet to the
boy and yeah so I've tied it in the
middle think that's a really nice way of
wearing it just the perfect thing to
have at this time of year when you just
want a little something on I probably
won't wear as a day coat because it's
far too hot to snazzy
but yeah you'll be seeing me wearing
a lot in upcoming videos I thought I
would introduce a team out so I think
I'm going to end the vlog here because I
already started editing it and it is
quite a long one so I hope you enjoyed
