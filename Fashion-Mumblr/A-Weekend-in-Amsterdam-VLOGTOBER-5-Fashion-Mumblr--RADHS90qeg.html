Radisson Blu which is really nice and
great location we are literally a couple
minutes walk away from the shops and
from the restaurant so it's perfect
location and you can see behind me the
view the canal is literally right there

breakfast choice of the perineum
stammers are you on there for the
pancakes

day of exploring so I think I've worn
this outfit several times before on
vlogs got my jeepers peepers sunglasses

sunny River Island roll neck and I've
got a thermal underneath as well because
it's so cold my eye Caravelle watch Miss
Selfridge skirt and then these are some
new boots from next they've got a decent
heel height for walking around in them

big bathroom big walk-in shower and and

ages
now when we went into 5/4 which is a
shopping center that show used to call
nearly every day when I went to mole
raisers where Connie going at that
male announcer by thinking euro is not
good is no pronouncement inviting things

works what a fan Chester so I'm going to
have
truffle macaroni cheese for 2 matrix
lose weight you have char steak sandwich
hey Charlie
so we may or may not have
unintentionally found ourselves in the
red-light district behind me you'll see
Museum of sex and the erotic shop and
we've just walked by lots of fern lovely
ladies don't sing in shop windows
I'm sorry I'm still doing it or
something like that we are correctly
a bunch of us
go
one half of 24 hours being typical
tourists I don't think the canals
defeated us to ac/dc gee we've just
curiosity on practice and she was about
two and a half I decided I'm really
going to do that later in shape
yeah
so we just had a nice lunch in the in
the main square area and we're looking
for the flower market now but the matter
seems to say that we're here but we're
not yet and right now we are scaling
how many fitting in the Osprey so we're
in this water shop which two metals and
Kyra seeds can cost from is your head
okay this
just just had a really lovely brunch at
basis and roasters which was like which
was a recommendation from one of my
friends back in London so huge affair
for recommending that place because we
would never have we've never really
looked in there because it's kind of
normal looking from the front but it was
amazing best coffee we've had in the
whole time even in Amsterdam we've had a
lot of coffees Charlie's really excited
because we are we going now darling
Monica Museum and so yeah we're gonna go
and see how that I don't think this
