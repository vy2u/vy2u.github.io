in Switzerland and we have come to the
fairness main sentence we're really
close to our hotel in bet as you can see
as you can see behind me there's a
really beautiful market and some really
stunning buildings so just really
walking tour of the city and I don't
know about the history
Hannah and I were just discussing the
fact that all the buildings here at
green we're like oh no just go that
Instagram things have been struggling to
get some nice pictures in the flower
market we can actually in the program
but it's really beautiful all the
buildings we can see behind me if you're
kind of familiar with fireball colors
that will missile that's the color that
I think they are but it's really
beautiful is just pretty strange seeing
a whole city that's green what do you
think is a green dome degrees yeah
the green building yeah it's different
but there's lady contrast very well of
an orange red flowers
so much a little bit out of breath but
wait until you see this view behind me
basically we have just climbed at the
top of this massive rock tower how many
stories I just say this is like so
generous 10
so we've just stopped from this fridge
to the bell going off in the background
even broader yeah and behind me this
area here that is where the bears live
and whenever I told anybody in the
positive ways so I was joking but no so
bad I think it means fair or it's like
the city of the marason thing so yeah
this
perceive as live unfortunate a doubt
and they have their own little echoing
voices
- except reached area
so we found a real live grizzly bear I
just insert the clip before that seal of
Cena and behind me this is the bear pit
which I had done had in my memory since
when we came here when I was really
really little and I was just saying to
Charlie that when I was little I think
employers about Tom when we last came
here it seems so big and so scary like
something a drastic park but really and
I was just getting an autumnal quiz
how's it looking ham so we're just
stopping for lunch or you just found the
most incredible restaurant and have a
look behind me all the tables and set up
with this shoe skin rugs and the tartan
tablecloth looks so lovely I'm going to
walk down here and you can see the view
and the tables where they don't want
lovely sheepskin throws if you're going
to perch on so yeah I've got a good
feeling about this lunch
okay so having picked up the camera in a
little while to be honest I went coma
after we had that amazing lunch so I
think I hope I blogged it we had lunch
at the Rosengarten which means rose
garden and it's really beautiful
restaurant
Charlie's laughs at me from my attempt
to German speak know what this has going
on by the way this / thing this is from
super dry and I didn't realize how much
of difference he's made but I tried not
putting it back on after lunch and
squeezing and then I pretty much gone
and I'm a shinobi again so I super dry I
will link it down below in fact I
haven't in half a day yet I will do it
on the outside in the second I can
change the Sun rises sorry I'm really
really like toast but yes there right
now we are in there
Paul clay I thought it was really koe
and he's an artist who lived in Banff
quite a long time it's really a building
it's and wave architecture looks really
cool it's quite dramatic on the
landscape and yeah we just had a look at
all of his work I've not actually heard
of him before
a hotel room and finally now I can show
you the view on the balcony because it
is daytime so have a look at this view
behind me so got the river there's like
a castle somewhere I get that way there
my headband in full display
yeah that's telling a view from the
balcony it's so gorgeous out here
and also it's five is gone five o'clock
I think it's like half five and yet it's
still really light out here so they're
daylight saving ISM different towers
that's a fun fact for you and but yeah
just gonna stand here and admire the
view for a little bit Dean that we've
been left some chocolate in our room
this is ours too damn chocolate which is
probably gonna be amazing but I thought
before I eat it sing as the lights
really getting a newest stereotypical
blogger chocolate on the bed sheet type
photo and I showed anything that story
to people I think it's not make coffee
on the bed sheets with the legs or
sexually displayed but yes I'm gonna do
a little set up down here with the
silver tray and the chocolate and try
and make it look nice and photogenic for
Instagram so I wish we loved so just
heading down for dinner now and Hannah
and I just took some outfit photos
outside and on the balcony which I think
it turned out really nicely so just
going downstairs to meet everybody now
I'm a bit of Rex and running back to the
room to get to my other lens we've just
been given a tour of the hotel
it's like a Bulbul dream and Makani was
used in the water our militaries to come
and have a tea to people sitting here
for their big dinners this is what me
and Charlie need in our house two things
because we are always arguing over my
clothes Mattox taking up the whole of
the bathroom so this is definitely what
we enjoy our house we just really jump
on the bed I didn't really the lenses
didn't work to look that I say oh my

can see I've just got changed because
we're now going out to the square where
we were this morning where I showed you
the flower market because they have a

update you on today we're currently in
the air for about to go home sadly and
since something
we went to you and museum art gallery
and is really good fun but we have less
type in the camera centers otherwise I
would have blocked it and the bull could
have been something my going on
nothing about us - it would make typing
already scheduled automates analyzes
paintings and really had no clue what we
were talking about that was really good
fun and then we went for lunch and the
restaurant was out seem credible I think
