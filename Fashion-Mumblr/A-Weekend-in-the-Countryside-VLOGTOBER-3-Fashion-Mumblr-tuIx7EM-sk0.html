3 it's Saturday again and so doing the
usual says they think anything off
twitch I play rugby in a minute I just
met my gorgeous friend cookie
and in the color run vlog if you watch
that one they've got little Dexter here
who doesn't know when to carried and the
dick and I are about to go and get some
nice breakfast at bills
just got to mom's house and little
Dexter is about to meet mums dogs Koko
and Louie for the first time so he's
just woken up for his little nap in the
car and I think the madness is about
having the house
so that still wanted to play but Pocoyo
we weren't having any of it so they've
just spin our chickens and have been
running around and hiding from Dexter
robots head out for Chinese now with mum
Dexter on cooker and Louie are still not
really making friends
Dexter wants three friends but cook I
know you're a little bit scared I'll
quickly show you what I'm wearing so
didn't show you earlier
so my outfit of the day is this really
nice snuggly jumper from super dry saw
some nice button details on the shoulder
three nice and warm for the rugby and I
just got my gray whistles t-shirt and to
me jeans are from boohoo I ripped ones
which you guys have seen quite a lot and
then my head and Muffy boots I was
wearing my Lee's earlier but these are
much more appropriate for the Chinese
back home now after a really nice at
Chinese at the restaurant that we went
to I wasn't really socially acceptable
to vlog during the meal so I didn't I
just took a few little short clips and
then we got home a couple of hours ago
and we were just watching the rest of
the Rugby England vs. Australia let's
just not talk about that I might edited
my vlog vlog him apart to which he guys
would have already seen so now a little
Dexter and I are just gonna set up camp
Dexter is sleeping in this little cage
down there tomorrow a busy day ok so
I've got quite a busy day with going
down to pass the seat I saw sister in
unique so nice little road trip and the
dogs are coming with us as well so yeah
I'm gonna get an early night good
morning it is Sunday morning and I've
just had my cup of tea so feeling a
little bit more alert I'm at Mom's house
and just about to get ready to go and
meet Charlie and his family because as I
said yesterday we're driving up to Bath
to see each other sister at uni and I
forgot to bring any skincare with me so
I'm going to have to use some of the
moms so let's see what mom's got in her
bathroom cupboard so we've got a nice
little dolphin cleansing milk we'll use
that one
what else have we got and the miss
lavendar toner that'll do and San Tropez
everyday face lotion is that good mum
just showed me this moisturizer by
Boucheron which I've put on instead of
the San Tropez because I need to do my
makeup quite quickly today don't really
have time for fake tan stinking this is
the bush run place vendôme oh crap it's
body cream and I've just put on my face
oh dear I thought it was rather
fragrance for moisturizer but yeah it's
actually body cream I was about to say
how amazing it was because it feels
really soft and it's well I said it's
acting batshit really shiny but mom
doesn't wear her glasses when she's
doing her skincare routine so she's been
using body lotion on her face so yeah
that's the lesson let me also show you
what's going on in here because the
texture on the floor is really
frightening gladwyn Louie it's trying to
get them to play with yeah Louie's
hiding in his chair cocoa is hiding on
the store don't want to play with him
luckily I did remember my makeup bags so
I'm going to be using the Rimmel match
perfection this is gonna fall in the
sink
yep oh dear I hope nothing went down on
the training Rimmel match perfection
foundation I'm gonna use my zoeva brush
and then I've got the new parents eyes
shadow palette with a two-faced blending
brush what else we going here I packed
this in a bit of a rush it's like bit of
a surprise bronzer mascara what else oh
good I've got my this is really good
anything I've spoken about this before
but it's the Dior hide your life I use
it as an under-eye concealer really nice
very moisturizing so Coco and Louie are
barking because dexterous sat in the
doorway of the room that they're in
which means that they can't get out so
look at this little siege that's going
on here
now you embarrassed I can't believe
they're scared of him he's sad
I don't anyone be scared of my little
baby we're at the rendezvous point and
we are actually for first time in my
life ten minutes early which probably
means that we're going waiting here of
20 minutes
because Charlie tends to give me the
meeting point time ten minutes before
it's actually the meeting point time yep
they're on 20 minutes away
because I'm on average about eight to
ten minutes late so he started to give
me heat the meeting time ten minutes
early so um yeah could be here a little
while couldn't we little food er yes yes
you
in the car
it's just put some nice move surviving
that nicely better so he just had a nice
little tool of scarlet room and her
Falls and honestly I do not wish that I
could go back city unique I think my
tidiness OCD would go a little bit crazy
her rooms really nice she's made it real
cozy so we're just walking data now and
we're about to go and find a nice tub
nearby there should be loads of nice
pubs around here and have a nice roast
somewhere
hello darling just had a lovely pub
lunch and now we've come to a field
nearby taking little Dexter for a walk
there he is
although he seems to be decided that he
quite likes eating cow fat so so trying
to stop Dexter eating cow fat which is
really challenging on the plus side he's
in a bit of a better mood now he's
getting grumpy earlier because we
weren't letting him have any of our food
so taxes are making lots of friends on
this world haven't you little man but
unlike with cocoa and Louie he's been a
bit of a scaredy cat how about you he's
been a scaredy cat
yes you have we are finally home after
another really long journey it was about
two hours in the way back there's a
little bit of traffic but as before
little Dexter was a really good boy he
just slept on my lap for most of the
time he cried a little bit in the middle
of the journey but if he just went to
sleep again after I cuddled him such a
good little man
yes we're home now finally and Troy and
I picked up Peter because they were
filling that with peckish even after our
big roast earlier and we're both just
gonna have a little bit of a pamper
evening even though it's quite late my
skin is feeling a bit stressed out I
think it's from like probably using body
lotion as moisturizer this morning
didn't help and then I just feel like
I've been touching my face all day and
touching Dexter it's probably not the
best for my skin but just feels a little
bit dry and bumpy so I've got out a
selection of products that so many years
this one I've not used before this is
the new Sunday Riley Blue Moon
tranquility cleansing balm and I think
if you saw my London Fashion Week vlogs
you'll have seen that they were using
this backstage at media wicks dead so
I'm gonna pop a little bit of this on it
first remove my makeup then I'm going to
use the Paula's Choice skin perfecting
salicylic acid because I feel like my
skin means something quite strong
especially for the bumpy forehead and
I've got a little bit of congestion
going on in this area so that's
tuna then I'm going to use two face
masks and no surprise my two favorites
origins original skin retexturizing mask
and put on my cheeks because they just
feel a bit gross and then the good old
what's the cool clear improvement
charcoal mask which is nearly empty
please get another one of these on my
forehead and chin because they are
clogged and then afterwards final step
one eyes off I mean we trying this which
is the new unique smart treatment oil
which apparently it says in the back is
good for repairing skin so I think
that'd be a good one to use afterwards
so yeah looking forward to trying out
all these new bits and bobs might and
paper nails might not depending on how
tired I am
then hop in the shower and off to bed so
say goodnight to guys now I don't think
you really need seem in a face mask
again I do it all I'd have my snapchat
if you don't follow me fingers down
below see I try you're not gonna have
nice so comfy evening that therefore is
the engine block to part three and I'm
gonna start filming drugs over part for
tomorrow cuz I've got quite an exciting
day or exciting evening really boring
day I'm just working in a day but doing
some really cool tomorrow evening so
make sure you check out blocked over
number four and that's out and yeah you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
