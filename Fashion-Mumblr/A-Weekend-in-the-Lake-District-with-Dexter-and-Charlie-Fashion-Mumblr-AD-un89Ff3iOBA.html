you
good morning and welcome to a very sunny
day yes Tito's negative strength
throughout those of it as though charlie
is driving at the moment
next van I decided to take weekends away
from London create the city madness and
have a chilled mini free spring break
and people they just don't see the
Charlie or I attribute cannot accompany
me right yeah I've never been inside
properties well it's one location that
I've met a lot of interesting places
yeah
so we saw we come and walking to my mom
when she came walking you those
girlfriends last summer and she would
not start something is how amazing it
was so we've been pretty keen to come up
here consensus and this is the pricing
me you get up here from London I think
it would probably be about five or six
hour drive that we took a surgeon train
yesterday afternoon and it was object me
out
really not that far and of course and
then we were able to bring dexter
weather I just super nearly joining us
we got off people tickets so it's
surprisingly affordable and definitely
much cheaper than going abroad they were
making the most of the British
countryside for today and it is sunny
I'm actually really really we're
actually on our way to seek Wyndemere
and yesterday we started our touring
actually so we got into the hotel we're
staying at a selfie place called Villa
at Nevins and we arrived we unpacked a
little bit and we checked the National
Trust website went to a castle walked
around there and it started heaving with
rains and then we just cruised up inside
the coffee and we went to dinner at the
hotel which was delicious project dunno
fabulous yeah I hadn't I think that's
one thing about this area and in general
like exploring he came food
yeah like different sizes different
cookies different local cooking in
nicest explore even if you've got
passion
we really were me I have a bootlace
because right yeah and combination ate
lunch lookin crazy yes I have pork
piglet lollipops absolutely
and then I went for trouble from Phra
Philippines and that's amazing and then
we shared I can't remember maps if it up
come another white chocolate right here
yeah yes oh so tasty Zia that was out
dinner that one as I was saying the
deadly freshmen incomes and we rent the
cars will be arrived to Papa's home
station by train yesterday and hopped
out yeah we've got lots of flexibility
which is great bringing on a some songs
so it's pretty much so far though we've
had the dexterous met one of yeah I
think it's so nice to hit on fast cuz
people relax yeah yeah so Meg Windermere
is served on the agenda today hope
you'll find a really nothing critique of
the lunch and then tomorrow and
substitute more hiking check
National Trust property it is so much to
do around here though I'm really careful
early in February
Charlie Naya paisa strength our priority
so may not this time we are not I bring
you guys with me we have arrived in
Windermere and we parked up and just
exploring the town we just went to a
place called angel in for a little bit
of pub lunch to set us off Charlie had a
burger over and I just had some nice
tomato soup with exactly what you're
craving record scratches yes I'm from
corpse crashing luckily most places
around here are very friendly through
options walking through the town again
now and then we're going to help you
find some work to do there are so many
fishing trip shops and I scream at them
so much like you're going to take a look
I really don't know about the decks
professor I'm gonna find my screams take
on our look
so we're going to have a Facebook and
I'm not sure if you can hear rumbling in
the background but we think there must
be like an RAF base nearby because these
super super cats what is that it's like
Top Gun keep flying over it doing like
loopy loopy the sky and it is
reverberation so doesn't it already
enjoyed these happening
meanwhile Dexter is just totally
obsessively sheeps is staring at them
we don't like you Dexter for new new
poem
so we've come to a place now called Rey
castle and if you imagine like a
fairytale castle this is pretty much it
have a look behind me at this
spectacular building it's so such an
iconic castle shape
Charlie's trying desperately hard to get
a photo of Dexter but little Chuck is
not playing along we're going to go for
one of the nice walks around here and
there are so many walks down here as you
can imagine and also so many incredible
buildings I think this must be the most
crowded National Trust property per
square mile in the whole of the UK every
every time we're driving we just keep
seeing country house after country house
and that all equally spectacular so that
side of me is the most amazing view of
the lake that's Lake Windermere it only
took us about 20 minutes drive from one
side of the lake to the other despite
the fact that it is the largest lake in
England because in France walking all
the way around it'll be dark close how
we got here we did that and also behind
me hopefully the camera is picking it
out but there are some snow-capped hills
I don't think they quite qualifies
mountains but despite the fact that it's
actually fairly warm today there's still
some snow higher from the peaks sadly we
can't get into the castle because it's
still technically low season but there
are loads of people just milling around
going for going to their own walks but
yeah we're not allowed into the castle
so we're just going to go and have a
wonder and enjoy the beautiful grounds
and take this little chaps for a nice
long walk to try them out
you
good morning it's another fabulous
beautiful sunny morning here in the Lake
District just taking this little chap
out for his morning ablutions apologies
I didn't properly talk too much at the
end of yesterday Charlie and I and
Dexter were all fairly knackered from
our long walks we went to the beautiful
ray Castle as you saw and then we hopped
back in the car and we were going to go
to a place called Hawks head or Hawks
meat but we took a wrong turn and ended
up down some really beautiful country
lanes but it just wasn't where we wanted
to be so we're going to head there this
morning after breakfast we're so so
lucky with the weather was just a
perfect crisp English country morning
so last night year we got back
eventually all three of us took a shower
because texture was rather muddy as well
so yes literally all three of us and
took showers and then we went to a pub
very close to I was staying in Levens
called the hand hounds and it was so
lovely because it was a very typical
English pub not like these chain pubs
that you get in London and definitely
not one of these kind of boutique pubs
it was a proper or with school English
pub which I really enjoyed Charlie had
fish and chips and I had a beef pie so
it was a very traditional proper English
meal and Dexter was welcome there of
course so that was really lovely have
dinner three of us today is our last day
but we're going to make the most of
every second we're going to go to that
village
we spoke to mum and apparently there's
loads of really cute little cafes so
we're going to make that our first port
of call and then we're going to find
some more lovely long walks I think I
mentioned yes there's also a brewery and
at the village that we're going to but
because we're not drinking at the moment
going to give that miss but I think it's
really lovely to leave some things for
next time so that's another thing that
you could do around here but for now
let's go and have some breakfast and get
going with the day
so we're in the little village of cork
catch now I think I might have called it
helped me earlier we could listen to
something out Harry Potter and not a
real place if I fell out
this isn't it everything it feels like a
pound that times got very old II will be
very quiet we are pretty much the only
people here we'll see maybe five other
people speak one okay close as well a
lot it's very young people here lots of
ice cream shop and lots of Beatrix
Potter shops I think she might have
lived here so we're going to carry on
home little wonder get a coffee and I
think we're going to find another night
like foggy
we've left the village now and we're
taking about an hour long hike which is
going to take us to I think a big manor
house with a man-made lake we can almost
see Lake Windermere over on the hills I
suspect Charlie you could almost be
hiking in the Swiss Alps right now it's
just that kind of scenery especially
with the snow-capped mountains over in
the background almost feels like we're
walking altitude rappel a little bit out
of breath not going to lie the only
thing that's missing is that dawning of
a cowbells yeah in the background but
it's so so beautiful
Dexter is loving life so we've been
hiking for about something an hour and a
half year we were trying to find
somewhere called town house and
apparently is that man-made lake but we
followed all the signs and walks meant
to be an hour that we've been going for
now and a half week Jonathan found it so
we've admitted the feet and we're going
to head back to Hawks head now mostly
because Charlie and I are really craving
some lunch
definitely craving a Sunday Rose row
Susan you're quitting would go down a
treat right now so it's got about an
hour and a half
walk back maybe we'll find a shortcut
maybe if we walk on the road it might be
a little bit
Dexter is starting to tire you're doing
very well considering how little is like
that anything buddy
he's got tired we have to carry the
voice because that legs are very about
three hours of walking we found it
finally found our way back to hooks head
and we know how to public Queens has and
we have lucked out because look how
great this London I've gone for which
five naki
and now radically live knocking what
have you gone for down battered scampi
which looks immense I'm going to plow
into a jars reclaiming yep and Colin
isn't having sticker pictures
oh no that's like every climber thank
you I just to say that we happily
so we made it back to the car park
Charlie's just feel like I'm talking
least ranging from is overridden
Charlie's has gone figure out how to pay
so dextran I just chilling in the car
picks up an amazing ice cream this is
like a pistachio sorbet from the little
ice cream shop which was in the little
village of hawks head and I think now
we're going to have to head back to the
train station so when we booked the
tickets they were really flexible you
didn't actually have to book your return
journey home when we paid so we're
making the most up flexibility we've
chosen to get the 3:43 train home and we
should be in London at around 7 o'clock
this evening so back in time for work
tomorrow
it's been such a perfect way to spend
the weekend I definitely want to plan
maybe like a girls trip here or perhaps
come with my mum and a few of her
friends it's just such a nice place to
come and escape London escape the city
we both feel like we've had an air detox
in my lungs
this weekend definitely think I want to
come back when it's a little bit warmer
maybe like later on in the spring or in
the summer there's so much to do here
Charlie and I've pretty much just done
walking but but we keep meeting lots of
locals and other tourists and visitors
and they keep telling us more and more
things to do so we definitely want to
travel back here and definitely bring
the extra long it was just so so easy so
Charlie on the way back now so I'll
catch up with you guys again on this
you
Oh
so we are finally back home after what
has been an incredible weekend Charlie
and I were just saying it's insane to
think that we were pretty much the other
side of the country today all the way up
north and yet it only took us under
three hours to get back to London so
incredible we made the most of the train
journey as well I showed you a few clips
and we managed to get a table seats so I
did a little bit of work and then when I
got brain-dead I used the Virgin beam
service which I'd never used before but
it's so cool basically you just download
the beam app on your phone I think you
might be I was doing a laptop as well
and then you can watch films TV series I
was even reading cosmopolitan and they
had a like mindfulness little brochure
as well so that was really really cool
and that's a free service so definitely
making the most out of that Charlie was
watching stuff on his phone as well
Dexter was just sleeping and looking out
the window so great way to pass the time
much better than driving I think and if
we driven China I'd sort of ends up
having an argument because he'd have
been bored stiffness driving whereas
that way we both could do we wanted to
do so definitely recommend taking a
train if you're going to go somewhere as
far away's the latest trips we are
already mentally planning our next trip
as I mentioned earlier they're just so
many things to do there there's loads of
lovely boutique hotels and I'm just
totally blown away by the food there as
well the place that we went for lunch
was scrumptious the dinner on the first
night especially at the Villa Levin's
was fabulous so definitely more of a
foodie destination that I thought so
Charlie was really really happy with
that
and so nice to be able to go on holiday
with our dog big world extra absolutely
loved it he is completely worn out I
can't believe how long he walked today
he did very very well and I'm absolutely
shattered to that Walter's totally
bamboozled me by working again
early night I really hope you guys
enjoyed this vlog and give it a thumbs
up if you liked it and if you'd like to
see some more travel vlogs and that is
all from me thank you so much for
watching our little UK mini holiday and
I'll see you very soon in my next one
bye
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
