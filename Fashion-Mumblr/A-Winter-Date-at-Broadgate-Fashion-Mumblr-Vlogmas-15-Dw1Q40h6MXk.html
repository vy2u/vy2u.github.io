firstly sorry that there wasn't a proper
vlog yesterday hopefully you enjoyed the
lush haul though yesterday was Sunday
and it was a day after our Christmas
jumper party so needless to say I was
feeling a little bit delicate very
exhausted and trying I'd had an argument
I wasn't a bit of a grump yesterday I
didn't think you guys wanted to see that
so decided to put up my lush haul which
I filmed a few days before that feel
viewing pleasures the hopefully you
don't mind hopefully forgive me and yeah
back to it today so it's Monday I'm
working from home today which is very
much needed I have so much photography
and editing and emails and all that kind
of fun stuff to do is that so you were
actually some it's quite fun so yeah
gonna be cracking on with that I've just
taken a load of nice photos downstairs
some Instagram beauty shots and some
blog post shots I'm gonna be filming a
get ready with me video tonight just
like a fun festive evening get ready
with me so I was kind of choosing the
products that and took a little photo of
them because I want to really be doing
blog posts for each video not vlogs but
um yeah in 2015 2016 going forward I
want to make sure that all my videos
have a corresponding blog post and yeah
trying to get myself into the swing of
that and then also I've kind of been
planning a bit of a giveaway because so
many of you tweeted me to let me know
that I got 10,000 subscribers yesterday
which raid cheered me up I was as I said
in a bit of a slump
I had my macaroni cheese was in a bit of
a food coma and then suddenly my tattoo
is like 10,000 subscribers so I'm very
very excited about that and very
thankful to everybody that has
subscribed to me so thank you so much if
you are honestly 10,000 I know it's like
tiny convert some youtubers but still
it's a hell of a lot of people and yeah
pretty exciting I'm very very um yeah
very thankful very month at subscribe so
thank you if you are a subscriber so
what I'm gonna do is put together a huge
bundle of products I know I've done like
a few giveaways for 12 days of vlogmas
but I think I might do at 10,000
subscriber giveaway but also I want to
learn a little bit more about you guys
so I'm going to do like a bit of a
survey that sounds very boring but I'm
gonna do like a survey monkey just so I
can find out who you are and what your
interests are so I can make sure that in
2016 I'm just doing stuff that you guys
really really like so I'm gonna run that
on the blog but when I've put it all
together then I will do a little video
about it which be good fun so I'm gonna
plan that a little bit today and then
later smoke China I going ice-skating
I'm going out for a meal so that would
be fun for you to join us with that one
but for now just coming oh I'm gonna
open up database of stuff which is the
postman just delivered and chased
Topshop because there was meant to be a
delivery on sustain it didn't arrive and
I need it for tomorrow because I'm doing
a photo shoot with J so yeah let's have
a look at the a soft stuff so this is my
Asus delivery it's rather ginormous I'm
gonna have a huge trying on session now
because yeah basically tomorrow I'm
going at to the great Foster's Hotel
which was the place the beautiful hotel
I went to for the very first vlog amaz
if you remember that and I'm going with
Jay from Olympus and we're going to take
some lovely photos hopefully the weather
is kind to us so yeah I need to decide
what outfits I'm going to take with me
and plan them so yeah let's have a
little trying on session so this is
actually one from my haul and last week
if you remember that one it's the self
portrait dress and I think I am a little
bit in love with it I've been looking at
to treat myself to a nice new dress for
quite some time now and this is just so
me it's kind of like a t-shirt style on
the top and then this bando little
freely lacy kind of - tui bit here and
then a really nice length as well it's
not too short and I think it's quite and
quite a grown-up a dress that I
currently get away with little slinky
numbers anymore and so yeah definitely
gonna be keeping this one and I think
I'm gonna feature it in my video I'm
doing a festive New Year Christmas
lookbook video oh it's got quite like
frilly colour as well so nice I'm gonna
leave links to all of these in the
description box so if you like them you
can have a little shop how cute is this
I love it and this is the next one also
from self-portrait I actually
a little bit in love with this I feel
like such a princess but it's quite an
impractical design I feel like it's
transparent as you can see at the bottom
they're quite short little petticoat
thing underneath I've worn my
Valentino's because I feel like it's
that kind of dress I think I might
double check the price of this one
because it is absolutely stunning but
I'm not sure when I would wear it
because obviously it's white so
currently wear it to weddings um oh I
don't know I love it so much you know
and you fall in love with something but
you're like it's not practical tell me
what you guys think so beautiful also
come over with this
I've got strapless one on but you can
see it oh it's so pretty
oh I don't know what to do help me and
this is another one from Ted Baker I do
like this one and it's quite a.m. it's
quite an easy kind of fabric it's
stretchy super stretchy fabric but I
have an issue with the length of the
bodice I think it makes my legs look
really short like I'd much rather it was
black up to like there I find that when
it cuts you off there it's a lot more
flattering see what I'm eating there
versus down there hmm I do you like the
material just wish it was fair like that
probably alter it but can I be bothered
okay so moving away from dresses I got
some more casual things and both the
scarf and the top of those from Reese
and I really like them it's not sure
about the whole outfit I love the colors
on this it's like a wine color and a
graver you better to show you there and
then the top has got this cool kind of
mesh detail and it's quite like a slouch
for almost batwing effect the leather
look leggings are just some old ones
from Zara and I might put those
misguided boots with it but not sure if
this is worthy of outfit photos so what
do you think okay so I kind of forgot to
film the rest of my eighth unboxing and
trying on but luckily my top shoulder
has just arrived and I have just fallen
in love with one particular piece from
that orders let me quickly show you what
I'm wearing now
it's this gorgeous silver gray jumpsuit
and I really like the length of it so
the trousers aren't full-length they
kind of stop just about the ankle and
then you've got this kind of crossover
waist and crossover detail here and I
think this was about the 70 pound mark
they're not too crazy possibly a little
bit less let me just have a look okay it
was 60 pounds and with my student
discount that made it 54 so I think
that's a really good price for this
really really liking it and definitely
gonna take this for my outfit photos
tomorrow I got my suitcase down ready
I'm gonna fill this up with all the bits
that I'm gonna take with me looking like
a bit of a hey guys I'm afraid I'm in a
very crappy draaga this afternoon
bloggers I have gotten to pick up the
camera and it's just quite a busy day we
were just I was doing emails and blog
things but now we are on our way to
Broadgate circle and with Charles and
we're going ice skating and then we're
gonna go out for dinner so a bit of a an
early week date night so it should be
fun but we're running a little bit late
there we were meant to be there at
something that's quarter past I hope you
they let us on and yes I'm wearing a
super fluffy jumper I'll show you it
properly or me get some good lighting
about them potentially quite
controversial but as surprised him and
delighted that Charlie actually liked it
and he died not in a kind of vlogging
mood right now
so we've just got inside the ice-skating
rink and it's too different to when I
came with the girls the other night
there's in the middle of a city in the
evening
a few days ago Charlie I can see me
Reverend
oh my god I'm always so surprised
I hope you go darling
be free
go on
Charlie going at the dolphin
it smell like
you be a rugby ball any nice men we're
not meant to you're doing well
my idea
do something
new charts to it
it's nice if it has
why is it you can actually Monday no I
should get one also quite like you have
my highlights a tips and advice I'm
going to stay here and open
Shaunie's sadly has decided that he's
not leaving the side of the race
like this would be a pretty good place
to come if you're just learning how to
skate or if you're just generally not
very good because pretty much the place
me being very boring
pretty much game on the salsify just
logon
have no chat with you
how's your day been
I honestly thank you guys so much for
all your loving comments I promise
they really make my day I don't I try
really hard to apply to them
put out a guitar
Lauren holiday look at him
so we survived ice-skating nice to be
back on solid ground sintered darling
yeah I think Charlie's definitely quite
relieved and now we're just trying to
find obeying about having a betrayal
we'd walk always through Liverpool
Street Station and so yeah I'm trying to
find out then because we have worked up
quite an appetite
I trained you well darling
so we had a lovely meal in urbane we
both had the set meal from the festive
menu at Chicago
gravlax steak and I had some doctor cafe
and roast head which is really really
lovely so we're just on our way home now
and I think our in the vodka X this is
gonna be me getting in the shower we get
home so enjoy Padma stay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
