joining me for the second episode of
Kasia mumblers summerhall weeks that
sounds really weird like I was talking
about myself in third person the second
episode of the V fashion mumbler summer
for weeks
so today's video as you can supplement I
know is going to be my affordable
fashion so everything in this part of
the video is going to be under 50 pounds
and I think I've got some really
fabulous pieces the high street is
killing it at the moment with fabulous
bits involved so I treated myself to
some really lovely pieces some of which
you may have already seen because I have
been dying to wear them they were in my
Chelsea in bloom look look in my what I
wore at rakuyo and just general vlogs so
I'm going to get straight stuck in there
so the pieces in today's video are from
a few different retailers we've got some
new look we've got some Miss Selfridge
we've got some ego shoes you've got some
machine and things so I get started with
this amazing swimming costume I wore
this in Madrid and it's a one-shoulder
piece I think it's such a statement
piece very loud very colorful and I just
think it's so kind of club Tropicana I
just I just love the colors I love this
one shouldered I love this ruffle detail
and I love the price I think this was
like 15 pounds or 25 pounds very very
affordable and I just I think it's
fabulous it looks great on I'll
hopefully try to do to clip here at me
wearing it in my material ugh but yes
this is from new look it's just
absolutely beautiful
one thing I would say though is on the
boob that doesn't have the shoulder I
was very conscious that I may have nip
slip at any moment so I would not advise
going down a size because then your
nipples may freeze up so yeah just be
careful when wearing this one maybe
don't wear any water parks but so
colorful so fun and I
love it a piece that I've not actually
tried on yet this is a 39 pounds hop
from Miss Selfridge I am loving this
smoking I trying to remember was right
now for this I think it's called smoking
where it's like super stretchy at the
top I think it's such a beautiful design
detail it's so comfortable it's so
flattering especially if you've got
great boobs I have no boobs but if I
wear a good bra then it just still looks
great this is a really affordable way of
getting that trend into your summer
wardrobe the color this kind of
porcelain mix of white and blue is going
to be everywhere this summer
very Italian Riviera and I just
absolutely adore it so this one falls
off the shoulder and then you've got
these quite large fugitive slaves in
this cotton material which feels kind of
limiting so it definitely looks quite
high-end so yeah a big fan of this
smoking details big fan of the factors
of the shoulder even bigger fan of the
price so yeah definitely check this out
from the Selfridge they are really
smashing it at the moment
I've picked up some beautiful pieces
from their recently it's one of my kind
of keep forgetting about and then when I
go on their website I'm like oh my
goodness you have so much great stuff so
yeah that's another great one from a
Miss Selfridge random one before I carry
on you may realize that I'm filming most
of my whole week videos in one day and
I'm just changing my lipstick and my top
in between I'm trying out these new
L'Oreal color riche and matte lipsticks
hashtag not an ad just opened my blogger
mail and really excited to try out some
new colors so I will leave in the
description box as well as links to
where I'm wearing my jewelry and of
course the clothes I will leave the name
of the lipstick from the l'oreal color
riche matte collection that i'm wearing
in that video this one is 2 to 7 hype
and so far very impressed with the long
lasting net the formula the color this
is really beautiful like Coralie
summer color so yes I thought I would
just sneak that one in there singing I'm
going to be wearing a different shade so
every video this weekend now I know you
guys have seen these before but I could
not do an affordable fashion video
without mentioning my new favorite cute
shoes these are from she
and I will try and make sure to leave
the UK and the u.s. websites and links
for these down below because I know
that's mostly where you guys are and
there are different websites are both
very confusing these are amazing chanel
dupes I think that Chanel ones are
probably over a thousand pounds these
are pretty much identical if not nicer
looking I just think there's such a
beautiful fit so these have got a black
toe cap you've got this baby cream
spongy leather they are mules as you can
see and then they've got the faux pearl
in the heel so obviously so many design
details they're pretty much a ripoff of
the Chanel shoes which I'm not okay with
but to be honest and I know that there's
a lot of mixed feelings about this and
personally I'm very much against the
whole shaking industry queue a million
comments thing like the death takes no
they're not because they don't have
Chanel written anywhere on them there
are design detail differences but I
would never have spent the amount of
money that the Chanel shoes are so it's
not that by buying these I'm taking away
from Chanel in any way if anything I'm
paying my respects to Chanel because the
stylist is so fabulous I was dying to
own something of this style I was never
going to be able to afford the Chanel
ones so yeah anything we're just adding
to the trend by buying these tubes right
I've known in the strange area and I
know everyone has different opinions
that's mine so sound off in the comments
below but I really love these I found it
very comfortable not the most stable as
I said but loved them and I think they
look so elegant they look beautiful with
dresses they really dress up jeans if
you work in an office and you just want
to add a bit of pizzazz to your your
look tailored trousers they look
beautiful with it become also from the
same website she in I did mention these
in my designer dupes video as well these
are these Stuart Weitzman deuce these
were 25 pounds I have been wearing these
a lot and I actually love them I love my
Stuart Weitzman one but I've worn so
much it they're now very dirty on this
way here which is quite painful when
they were over street
pounds so yeah I'm going to getting a
lot more use out of the dupes they're
not as comfortable they're not quite as
hard but they look so similar and really
if I was seeing these before I've seen
this too at white someone and even knew
the very deuce I probably would still
afford these because they're just
absolutely beautiful
okay I don't know if you saw that but as
I was putting them away one of the
pearls so just pull it off that's what
you get for buying a juice instead of
the real thing obviously the quality is
not there the little bit of superglue
will pop this back in place and if you
buy these refers to your white smile
you're still going to be 350 pounds
better off so even with the superglue
you better off with these guys while
we're on the subject of gifts and shoes
where do I really got one of these it
makes me think that Dickens has
definitely stolen the other which is why
I'm very glad I didn't spend a fortune
on the Gucci ones because these are a
dog's best friend Dickens and Dexter
both we love to chew these so yeah
definitely glad I got the bargain
versions these are from ego and yes I
did mention them in my high street kids
videos but I put them on sofa to talk to
you guys about because I actually wanted
to mention some other shoes which I was
really hoping we're going to have
arrived in time to me filming at all but
they haven't from any photos of my new
shoes purchases here they are volunteen
Oh dupes also from the same website
where I got these so I'm expecting great
things to be honest I am still very
tempted by Valentino once I was watching
Victoria from in the fro her cue the
video she said she was volunteering
pretty much non-stop but I think I'm
going to get the dupes first give them a
bit of a trial and then if I see that
style really working with my wardrobe
then I probably will invest in Valentino
one so yeah these issues that are coming
I'm so excited
wish I could have shown them in today's
video and that you're crazy singing a
lot on my Instagram from stories blogs
etc and I will leave a link down below
hopefully this'll in stock because I
think they're going to be quite popular
so moving back to affordable clothing
and new look I really love the Styles
that look
expensive and they are incredible value
for money this is a pair of white clots
I have a pair from Topshop that I've
been wearing so much recently and they
are full length wear these are crops so
these actually look fabulous with these
because they really frame the shoes they
look so elegant and it's also wore these
clots with my blue and white stripes of
Monaco top touched into it while I was
in Madrid apps that you love that outfit
B they don't have the hook knife here
and they don't have a button or anything
it's a very simple lip no pockets no
extra design details those things are
only 20 pounds so a big bargain and I
think lots especially white Palazzo have
a lovely drapes like these do look so
elegant they're so feminine and very
much up my street so if we show a
similar style then definitely recommend
a pair of affordable white cups in your
water and summer like these while I was
on the new-look website I spotted this
handbag and I think it's so adorable
it's got kind of further vibes about it
with the push lock here which has got
little kind of studded details and make
them look like little gems you've got
this chunky rose gold
why should kind of yellow gold strap a
really nice length could be one cross
body or just corner of your arm I
actually have been holding it cries like
doubled up over my arms and you can see
it is really fun palm print and this is
why I love the high street because this
bag is $15.99 this print is very
statement so I wouldn't want to spend a
fortune on sending this statement and
something that is probably not going to
be in fashion for a huge amount of time
but for $15.99 I thought it was worth
investing in the palm print trend just
in the form of a simple accessory so
yeah another one from you look I'm very
sorry by the way about all the
background noise Charlie is moving
around upstairs looking at into wardrobe
and we have very squeaky floorboards and
Dexter and Dickens are both
charming on tour with their dentists
picks so sorry about the background
noise but can't be helped so next I've
got a piece from boohoo I did actually
ordered this from ASOS and but you can
order it from boohoo comm
this is a cheesecloth cold shoulder
dress don't really know why I called
cheesecloth first and that
the style so you've got these in
spaghetti straps to go over your
shoulders and then for the sleeves they
kind of come off from the side hopefully
they stay attached you never know when
they are just affordable but then you've
got these suited sleeves really lovely
lightweight material be great for summer
holidays and then it's really beautiful
big lace which comes across the whole of
the neckline it goes down into a slight
V and then this is a very short dress
subscreen dress style very lovely light
flowy material
I can imagine wearing this and like I'd
be so Greek islands that kind of trip
really beautiful soft Airy style both
looking for doing this as a beach
cover-up etc and then I have another
piece from Miss Selfridge still got the
label on this in the UK for and with 25
pounds this I kind of got a beautiful
bit which is from Topshop I love it
but Stoney defense by Venus is around 45
pounds obviously these aren't the same
but very similar kind of vibes I
actually bought these to wear I was like
getting short I thought it looked really
nice with the kind of parent style and
by the way I didn't make that up it's
actually the style the kind of ruffle
detail at the top and then you've got
the DIY bows on shoulders again I think
it's just such a really chilled out
laid-back fire the trend really
beautiful and material you would never
be able to tell that this is super cheap
well I think 25 pounds isn't super super
cheap but definitely affordable and yeah
really love you on to summer kind of
another that water table so this is
probably my favorite piece in the
affordable haul this is a beautiful
dress I think you miss around the 45
pound mark so just sneaking in under my
50 pound limit this is from Miss
Selfridge again I could not believe it
when I saw this on the website I
couldn't believe it even more when I
tried it on what I really know about
this is the kind of ladder detail around
sleeves and insert the clip of me here
in one of the bars in Spain having a
coffee and I just think that this ladder
detail looks so effective like I
mentioned and I think it was yesterday's
video
this ladder detail really reminds me of
dresses from like self-portrait in
Zimmerman definitely a trend we're going
to be seeing a lot of this summer
along with ruffles and along with kind
of floaty material dresses
this really does tick so many boxes it
pulls in at the waist thanks to this
which we call it smoking details very
flattering and very elegant length as
well it comes down to a little bit above
the ankles still shows off the footwear
would look amazing with gladiator
sandals and love the color I think it
looks great on kind of all skin tones or
hair colors and it is very very
flattering very lightweight material I
wore it in 20 degrees in Madrid actually
I went up to 34 degrees the veils
wearing this it is hot lining and yet
somehow I wouldn't to scorch showing it
so big big fan of this and I'm so glad I
picked this up some money a lot of you
thousan next we have a bikini so
annoyingly it has escaped my brain the
designer that is doing this kind of
promises still and carne movie don't
know the designer that's doing this
floral detail on to certain questions
this year it is a designer seeing people
like Instagram yet but I actually know
that when I picked up the zucchini when
I saw people instagramming the designers
version was like oh that looks like my
chin bikini but yeah so this is a
one-shoulder bikini top and I also have
the bikini bottoms that also have this
floral detail and that have not tried
this on yet if by the time I edit this
video I have tried it on because I may
be taking this to France in me tomorrow
and I will insert a photo or a check
here if not I'll insert a clip of it on
the website so you can see what it looks
like but yeah really like this I think
it was like under 20 pounds even if it's
not a designer inspired piece I still
think is a really effective and
beautiful bikini so a link for trying
this is summer and to its monochrome
just very timeless very chic and a great
bargain alright the last piece and this
is another one from Miss Selfridge and
no I'm not only not the same top again
this is actually a dress but very very
similar in style it's got the same
smoking detail at top to the blue
embroidery same lovely light weight
cotton material although this actually
looks slightly cheaper and only up close
though this was 35 pounds and then
you've also got this darker blue lace
embroidery detail down at the bottom
this is quite the short dress I would
recommend this for wearing the beach or
you know maybe you just like wearing
short dresses but
could be quite revealing so yeah
definitely a great ones pack for beach
holidays great bargains easy to throw on
really lovely and lightweight and yes
I'm a big fan okay I feel like I'm in
talking for quite a long time to the
affordable fashion halls but I really
hope you guys enjoyed looking through
these pieces with me hopefully you guys
will agree that the high street has some
amazing bits and bobs at the moment so
chapters all these pieces and you
definitely wouldn't guess about
affordable fashion I think the way you
style them up you can make these pieces
that really love in high-end so really
impressed with all these retailers for
lovely lovely pieces for the summer
months if you have reached the end of
this video then your challenge for today
is to leave a flower or mention the name
of a flower can be the word town can be
Rose me Lily whatever just something
floral related in the comments so that I
