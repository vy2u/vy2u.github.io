me for another fashion video as part of
the fashion mumbler spring edit so i've
been having quite a lot of requests from
you guys lately to do an affordable
fashion video so your wish is my command
today I'm going to be sharing with you
some pieces I've picked up from the high
street lately that are all under fifty
pounds a lot of them are way less than
50 pounds there are some real bargains
here and I've definitely added my kind
of edit to these pieces I didn't want to
bring this massive haul full of kind of
throwaway fashion but I wanted to show
you the pieces that I think are perfect
for my style and hopefully things that
you will love that are in a very
affordable price bracket retailers are
included in today's video include
Primark misguided Dorothy Perkins new
look I think that's everything
but let's get started with Primark so I
always go into Primark looking for one
thing usually coat hangers and I always
end up coming out with way more than I
bargained for and that's definitely what
happened this morning actually so in
here I'm not going to show you
everything because I do have quite a few
kind of hen do pieces not of my own hand
ooh but one of my best friends Sophie hi
hen do soon and so yeah gonna get rid of
all of those from the bag and show you
what else is inside so first of all this
dress and this I picked up for Charlie's
little sister's party I say little
sister it's gonna be her 21st birthday a
couple of days after you're watching
this her party is Woodstock themed so I
wanted something really kind of boho II
something that wouldn't matter too much
if got a little bit muddy because it is
gonna be raining on that day so very
much festival style and this I thought
was absolutely perfect
it's got ruffle sleeves it's got buttons
down the middle a little ribbon going
around the back so I can really cinch it
in and create a very feminine silhouette
and then it goes all the way down with a
big slit in the middle where the buttons
stop it'll definitely kind of flare open
a bit this I thought was absolutely
perfect for a Woodstock themed party and
also the kind of thing that I'll get a
lot of use out of in summer I think it's
really nice to have things like this in
your wardrobe because a summer dress
isn't instant outfit pair this with a
pair of sandals and that's your outfit
sorted you don't need to think too much
about it and I think that when it comes
to making this look
if you've got a lovely crossbody bag to
pair with this it'll look absolutely
beautiful
jumping ahead of the gun a little bit
here but I picked up these sandals from
misguided amazing Valentino dupes
and I thought they would go so so
beautifully with this dress so I'll show
you how these look styled together in my
Tron clips
speaking of Valentino tubes I also
picked up these little flat sandals from
Primark and it just blows my mind how
affordable these were six pounds like
that actually blows my mind absolutely
incredible because they're so simple
there's just not much that Primark can
do to make them look cheap if that makes
sense
they just have these lovely rose gold
studs on the straps then a faux leather
strap to granule and cool they even have
this metallic detail not sure if you can
see it there around the heel which is a
detail that I would not expect for a six
pound pair of sandals and they do have a
very squidgy soft cushion sole so
hopefully they'll be very comfortable I
would quite happily have paid 30 40
pounds for these the quality does not
feel overly cheap at all obviously they
don't look as luxurious as real
Valentino's which is a relief because
real Valentino's I'm sure have two zeros
on that price tag but they don't look
cheap at all they look like a really
lovely pair of sandals six pounds can't
believe it this is what I went into
Primark for ended up going a little bit
overboard but I get so many questions on
my hangers they are all from Primark and
I always get their cotton pads from
there as well so yeah this is what I
went in for something else here that
really blew my mind with how affordable
it was is this little summer dress again
from Primark 10 pounds this looks like
the kind of thing you'd pay 4050 pounds
from mango I can imagine those kind of
like measure L brands from revolve
bringing out something like this for
summer holidays and for just generally
warm summer days absolutely gorgeous it
is fairly long this will probably come
to just below the knees and then it does
have this tie in at the waist as well if
again you pair this with my misguided
Valentino sandals will look absolutely
dreamy the flat sandals as well if
you've got any little wedge sandals they
look absolutely beautiful
and once again this is kind of thing
that accessorized well it will not look
like a Primark piece you could tell
someone
it was far more expensive and when worn
with some lovely accessories would
definitely give your
it's a very kind of boho luxury feel
after Primark I went into new look I got
a few more Hindu pieces couldn't resist
showing you these some little like
champagne glasses I got loads of fun
things like that but then also this top
this was twelve pounds and again I feel
like it could have been easily a Topshop
top which I have paid twenty to twenty
five pounds for I think that this almost
linen s crateria Liz very much on trend
this year and then as is this tour
choice shell effect button absolutely
beautiful the straps are not adjustable
so I'm fully prepared to adjust them
myself don't be afraid to do that it's
just a case of getting some scissors
chopping them and then stitching like do
a little snip here and then just doing
some very very small stitches to attach
it at the perfect length so it's not too
much of a big deal that the straps
aren't adjustable cami tops like this
are really practical to have in summer
if you do end up going on holiday then
it's great to have something like this
you can just bundle into a suitcase if
you're doing carry-on only pair it with
a skirt pair it with trousers little
pair of denim shorts a very very
versatile piece for spring and summer
now I know I've done a Topshop all very
recently here on my channel but since
then I have picked up a couple more
pieces that I thought I would show you
today first of all this pair of super
high-waisted trousers these look amazing
on they are so leg lengthening if you're
quite petite like me then they are just
the most amazing thing for giving you
Victoria Secret model legs I think that
like literally they come to just below
the boobs they are so high waisted they
give a really amazing effect and such an
instant amazing outfit pair this with a
plain white t-shirt and that is your
outfit absolutely sorted I picked these
up in a size if you dug up in a size 4
yeah I got these in a size 4 so I really
wanted them to be very slim fitting and
if you do want that look I would say
size down sometimes the Topshop trousers
I'm 6 with the brown very high waisted
ones I showed you in the hall I needed
the six for that but because of this
material it's not too clinging to the
body a size down is definitely more
flattering in my opinion
color wise these are absolutely perfect
for spring if you are allowed to wear
what you want for school then I think
these would be amazing for that for days
at the office for meetings very
professional-looking and yet very very
stylish and then if you saw my Instagram
while I was
at Vienna in Austria you'll have seen me
wearing this excuse me what I just did
do it up but this skirt I thought was
absolutely adorable it's got a little um
kind of paper bag detail at the waist
this strap which you can tie into a bow
just looks so beautiful a perfect piece
of spring as well it was very cold in
Vienna and yet I still wore this with
little sandals my little mime you love
shoes and because it's so long and such
a very thick material I didn't feel cold
which is great if like me you're quite
feminine with your style and you love
wearing skirts but it's just a little
bit too chilly then definitely try
something kind of midi-length like this
because I think it's such a lovely way
of having a very feminine item in your
outfit at this time of year next we move
on to misguided and this piece I have to
apologize because I can't remember if
it's under 50 pounds or not but it is a
big wool coat or faux wool or I don't
know just a nice pink coat I think that
this is great if you are looking for
some room for your spring wardrobe but
your winter coats are just a little bit
too wintery personally I've put a lot of
my really dark colored coats up in the
loft I don't be wearing black coats or
grey coats at this time of year but
still we do have those days when it is
very chilly especially here in the UK so
by getting something like this I feel
like it's a nice way of adding warmth
but because it's such a lovely light
pastel color it's kind of thing that is
very much seasonally appropriate I did
pick this up in a size 4 as you can see
I have not worn it out yet I'm gonna try
it on in the overlay clips now I'll give
you a thumbs up or a thumbs down in the
overlay clips as to whether I'm gonna
keep it or not because I do find that
misguided coats can be a little bit hit
and miss unlike more premium retailers
they don't pay quite so much attention
to the fit so it's not the kind of thing
I'm going to want to keep if it doesn't
have a really lovely look to it but
hopefully hopefully they'll have got it
right it does look quite simple so
fingers crossed is not much that they
can go wrong with it also from mask I
did I have this adorable little skirt it
is a faux suede miniskirt with a
beautiful scalloped hem I think this is
really adorable and it is a fabulous
addition to a spring wardrobe the kind
of thing that is just instantly a very
cute addition to your outfit however I
must say I am a little disappointed with
the quality of this the way it's been
cut at the bottom is quite scruffy the
lines are not even
I can see where the scissors have
slipped and those little kind of snags
in the fabric I'm not sure if you about
see this but here you can see where it's
just not being cut very neatly at all
there's an actual kind of rip there
having said that the effect is there it
looks beautiful from a meter away but if
people also look really closely they
would see that actually it's not a
terribly good quality piece but you know
what I have a really particular eye for
this kind of thing and a lot of people
these kind of details they just don't
matter they're not that important so if
you don't care that it's not perfectly
cut at the bottom then I think it is an
absolutely beautiful skirt the color is
gorgeous it's very comfortable to wear
and yeah a really really beautiful piece
just not the highest quality so you've
been warned and then of course I already
mentioned these sandals briefly earlier
these are amazing and these are again
from misguided very affordable I think
35 pounds the Valentino ones which I
have actually also splurged on you'll
see those in tomorrow's video I have no
regrets buying both pairs I think that
the brown is the kind of thing that I
wear a lot on holiday because of the low
heel I'll wear them on days and I know
I'm going to on my feet a lot they are
very very comfortable all the straps
mean that your foot is totally secure
and yet sometimes if I know that I'm
going to be going to slightly smarter
occasions I will still wear my actual
Valentino's so tell me if you think I'm
crazy I probably am to have the tube and
the real version but that's just me if
you lower styles so much then why not
invest and get a more affordable pair as
well I mentioned earlier about having
lovely floral dresses in your wardrobe
for summer this one is from Dorothy
Perkins again a beautifully affordable
piece and I just love the design detail
on this one all the ruffles are just
super feminine very much my style once
again it has got a tie in at the waist
so you can make it really flattering and
fitting to your body and then what I
adore about this is it's got quite kind
of like a salsa style bottom so it's a
dipped hem higher at the front and lower
at the back so I don't know it just kind
of reminds me of salsa dancers a little
bit for my summer holidays this will be
amazing and again warmer spring and
summer days here in the UK I probably
pair this with a nice necklace and some
delicate jewelry crossbody bag or even
if I eventually invested in on my trend
that would look really cute with this
and
so it's something I was hoping to
include in this hall but hadn't arrived
yet uncertified of it on the screen here
I finally found an amazing High Street
straw bag I've been looking at for a
dupe for this one I think the brand is
like Marx something from there supporter
but I fell in love with this bag and set
the designer 1 on the screen here and
I've been looking for a designer dupe
for that for so so so long and then
finally saw that new look 1 so that's
when it arrives will look really really
cute with this absolutely love it I'll
leave the bag and the dress linked down
in the description box below so there's
everything in my under 50-pound haul I
really hope you enjoyed looking through
these pieces with me for more affordable
fashion then definitely watch my Topshop
haul and also my Zara and mango haul
they'll be linked down below because a
lot of those pieces are also under fifty
pounds but I didn't want to repeat
myself so thumbs up if you enjoyed this
video and you'd like more affordable
fashion videos from me
I really enjoyed looking through the
high street and there are so many pieces
here that genuinely I absolutely love
sometimes I get a little bit carried
away with my premium and you know
slightly high-end retailers and I forget
that these affordable retailers actually
have amazing things so thank you guys
for requesting it because I'm super
pleased with all of these pieces that
I've got so I have you guys to thank for
that thank you so much for watching
