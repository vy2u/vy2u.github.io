Maksim Vicky and will and Sarah are in
moussine in the French Alps as you can
see behind me it is fairly spectacular
here we're actually staying in Max's
Shanny
so before we go out for the day I want
to give you a little shallow tour
because this place is absolutely
incredible also it's so beautiful today
really really for me so I think I'm
going to go out and about and do a
little bit of exploring we've just had a
lovely breakfast but yes before we go
out which as you can see in a couple of
minutes I'm going to give you a quick
quiz around this amazing house okay so
this is the entrance hall we've got this
amazing like exposed brick on all the
walls beautiful like floor lit lighting
and then in here because it is a ski
chalet they've got all their skis and
has got a light spot it okay and they've
got these like warmers for their ski
boots skis over there and then that's
another boot room that's some new skis
that Max is just ordered and then here I
don't know if you can see this because
the light's not on very well they've got
this like wine cellar which goes up all
away two storeys and then a family
friend did some painting like a mural up
there for them but just is really cool
about this glass separating it and
that's where they store all their wine
two bedrooms down here that I'm not
going to go into so I think we'll and
Sarah getting ready
this is mine Charlie's room obviously we
slept in the bed last night so it's not
perfectly made so yeah it's very typical
ski chalet ish got a little bathroom
showering that one at the wardrobe
bathroom and this incredible balcony
with the most amazing view of more szene
look at this so pretty and then in that
room there that is max and Vicki's room
then here we have got the amazing lounge
you've got Charlie chilling in the
corner say hello darling hello darling
that's nice in there my friend just
review the a beautiful lounge got all
these blankets this is literally the
world's biggest cow if that's a real rug
done if you can see the scale of it but
it's ginormous and all these little
details got the logs got a huge sonar
system massive TV fireplace and then you
can see the top of the cellar there as
well and then if we go up here we've got
the kitchen which is this really big
wide open space fridge in there ovens
storage espresso machine kettle or
dislike' built-in cupboards a huge
island which is just really sociable big
jäger
and then look at this dining area so
they've got this incredible big wooden
table with the stools have all got these
lovely fur sheepskin rugs on them
absolutely beautiful
very typical Chalet style
so that's the dining area and then if we
go out here I'm not going to open a tox
I think max has locked it but you've got
this beautiful hanging chair reviews
overlooking the valley then as you come
up the stairs you've got this
overlooking area you can see chairs down
there chilling in the lounge and finally
up the final flight of stairs there's a
little office area here and Max's
parents room the grand master bedroom
and they've got another balcony this
incredible rug which is literally the
squishiest thing ever
and never a bathroom as far
and then finally they've got this big
outside area this is where we had our
breakfast this morning with that view in
the background which as you can imagine
was amazing
cable car just whizzing by that goes up
to irori hours and then they're actually
still building a fire pit here so this
is going to be some steps going down and
loads of seats around a big like bonfire
in the middle so as you can see pretty
spectacular house we off to Vic Mountain
the mouth
Lewis Hamilton driving me here was bad
yeah
we'll sweating out the alcohol
say that get max it's the French Swiss
border
so that's Switzerland and this is France
alright so we've trekked and we've taken
a chairlift and we are now I don't know
where we are but we're very very high
look at these surroundings pretty
spectacular so Charlie has walked out
the samsung gear
360 and we're going to attempt to take a
360-degree photo and video yes look at
that so now I can see what the little
camera is seeing on my phone and we're
going to be able to get a pretty epic
photo my 360 camera was a success
I can't annoyingly put 360 photos in a
YouTube video because you have to be
interactive but what you can do to see
the photo is go on my Facebook page I'll
leave a link down below and you'll be
able to like move your phone and see a
360-degree view of where we are so I'll
leave a link to my facebook page down in
the description box but for now let's
just take in this incredible view
so we're now on the chairlift on the way
down I think this is the weirdest place
I've ever blogs would you say darling
um it's probably the highest house Gina
look actually no no isn't it starts a
dead yeah sure yeah you did blog yeah
and that maybe not many not I don't
think I've logged while on chalice this
is pretty yeah it's nice though today
it's very peaceful

a vlog for you take over
I'm hacks like iron take over so we are
now we're now on the chairlift
yeah down we had nice and low nice climb
will and Max would have sweat off their
hangover they're up for that 4:00 in the
morning captain Jager I was a good boy
didn't have any booze so panic
um yeah no we're gonna have to swim in a
lake army I think bit of fresh water
yeah it should be epic wish texts or
sings oh I don't do thing loggin you and
ask you very much love that no he's only
little yes so that's how we get the
bikes up here
having a quick drink
hangover pets the sea Croatia
you
Oh
we came back from our adventures
climbing the mountains and everyone was
so so so knackered so myself
Vicki and Jarrett just had really nice
in that in the lounge I'm not sure I
came here plan you it's now absolutely
pouring with rain outside and it's
literally the cookie
Oh
imminent cozy with the rain so snugly
I'll be champagne garden it's good
so a little bit later now and everybody
is getting ready for our barbecue
tonight it's going to be so cozy in the
dining room I think I showed you a few
clips of the table will behind me is
taking control of barbecue and finally
the rains have stopped and it's looking
really stunning looks assumed in the
office probably
good morning so Vicki and I are up
bright and early whereas Chesser is
currently passed out and the room
upstairs which didn't even turn up a
little bit Civic and I had an early
morning stroll into town we went and got
some coffee and we went into a lingerie
and we picked up the most beautiful
macaron I've ever seen which Vic is
currently photographing behind me let me
show you this bad boy here it is also
look at that view
how stunning but macaroon raspberry and
passion fruit with a little test tube of
cui was it back
you
so for today's activities they've come
to moussine adventures or alpine
essentially we don't know what it's
called it's basically the morsy
inversion of go eight I'm wearing a very
fetching outfit from a t-shirt got my
harness and a bit so I've been very
stylish and I think we're about to do
some like three climbing zip wiring the
hi
so we survived the agility course it was
actually rather knackering as I think
you saw Vicky took over the camera and
we had like zip wires we had climbing
rope ladders we had tight lines
it was actually really hard and it's
about 27 degrees the moment so it's
really really hard and yeah we just
stopped off at the cafe had a pint hello
again so I can't remember the last time
that I've logged was I think maybe it
was after our trip on the high rope
thingies I'm not sure but either way so
the afternoon was spent here in the
chalet it was boiling boiling hot so we
got some pizzas and then we had a little
nap out in the sunshine which was lovely
I think I did actually pick up a little
bit of color so yeah partly if you're in
the mountains the atmosphere is thinner
so you get the best tan hackney yeah
your theme is very chilled and then um
we've just been going ready for dinner
I'm wearing the hoodie beauty lip thing
which I'm obsessed with Vicky's just
using it now as well so gonna be
matchy-matchy I'm wearing it double
pleats so I've got my pleated a soft top
on and pleated metallic trousers from my
Topshop haul video because I just love
them so good for eating as well because
they expand which is wonderful um so
yeah we're going to go into town now and
get some dinner there's an amazing place
that Max recommends called rotund and
I'm already rather peckish so it should
be wonderful and I just want to show you
this view behind me because the Sun is
setting at the mountains and it looks
stunning look at that all the camera's
not picking it up
can you see also I really wanted to film
a video this afternoon but I forgot that
my 5d doesn't have a flip-out screen so
I filmed a little bit it was completely
out of focus so if anyone knows how to
plug it into your laptop and see
yourself on that let me know because her
motor would cool
Oh
good morning so yesterday's logging was
a bit of an epic fail I didn't really
film that much um I'm very out of breath
because we're currently about 1,500
meters up and we're going for a hike and
as you probably know there's not much
oxygen or there's much less oxygen when
you're this high so it's quite hard
quite hard on the old lungs how're you
finding it darling
sorry how're you finding this work
what's about Oh me on the other hand I
am struggling Muruga Lim and I've now
got your bag
yeah Chinese Thai my bag but we are
hiking Vicky in exile steaming ahead and
it's just so beautiful like look around
me right now okay not that way is right
and the only sounds we can hear our
cowbells running water and a few insects
in the grass so very idyllic morning
it's also boiling hot and this our last
day so perfect time to explore the
mountains
so we made it not to the very top of the
mountain because that is deadly but we
made it to about 1500 meters which is
pretty darn high absolutely knackered
we've just been taking some photos on
the rocks and enjoying the peace and
quiet literally just cowbells and a
stick it's easy making a buzzing noise I
don't know some kind of insects so
pretty spectacular thing up here just a
million miles away from Istanbul of
London look how beautiful it is
don't fall in any cow okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
