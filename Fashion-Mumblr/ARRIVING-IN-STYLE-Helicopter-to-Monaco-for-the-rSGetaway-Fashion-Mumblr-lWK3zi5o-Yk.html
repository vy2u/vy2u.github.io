told we are actually getting to more
group in a helicopter component
narrative slightly surreal very excited
that was a bit of a whirlwind journey it
took there's no time at all to get to
Monaco we're now in our hotel or the
hotel and parish and I have major day
job it was actually this time last year
same place same hotel that I came here
with Clarence in which you may remember

keep honest it will not every last year
I here on a girls trip this time so
let's go and see there after a champagne
drinks reception here at the hotel we
just come up to our rooms and this is
possibly one of the most beautiful hotel
rooms I have ever seen as then let me
just show you because I have no one ah

Horace tats just in case you get a
little bit hot and Sun and then we've
got we've got a perfume and this hotel
smells absolutely amazing I'm hoping

then let's see I think this one you like
little short apparently gets quite
chilly in the evening so this is going
to come in really handy also how
adorable is the floor so pretty and then
also a little shirt this is like kind of
the pool boy uniform probably and a
teddy bear that is so adorable little
hotel and massage teddy bear they have
absolutely spoiled her next up is a
little box front reward style let's see
what goodies are in here oh my goodness

yard pillow mist to spritzing my pillow
keeping it nice and relaxing in evenings
and then a 1-minute facial from Ren I've
actually tried this before love it
radiance renewal Mars perfect for after
flying I've got a little SPF 30 from
Vichy this is amazing screenshot and
chills obviously you guys know about the

think this is my bits and bobs from
Dallas from the D edited so I actually
got a few things personalized but and
have time to pick them up
so I'm guessing that's this is going to
be let's have a look
thank you Steve Richie reasons that is
adorable
oh my goodness
absolutely spoil - look at this this is
like a little jewelry box so I can keep
my jewelry and accessories in here when
I'm traveling and it's got my initials
on it or my name rather so inside look
at this so practical I carry so much
jewelry with me I travel this is so
perfect and then a little pouch for like
your handbag makeup again with my name
on it and then this has got my initials
which is so good for like keeping your
travel documents in so so spoiled so I'm
feeling like a very lucky girl at the
moment I think the rest of the afternoon
we're going to go out and take some
photos and enjoy the site so I will
catch up with you guys and a little bit
hopefully they're going to bring my case
up soon if I can get ready to head out
right sorry
a clear way and maybe
so is that the hotel we are out and
about exploring Monaco and basically the
mission that's for this afternoon is to
get that all-important Instagram photo
that all around me
we also doing their shoes coming to take
a moment to appreciate you yet dress Oh
heaven oh my goodness where are them to
say I'm sorry Paragon yes we're going to
a chaplain getting where again and again
be perfect every time so you saw Claire
behind me is getting her shots taken
this is what really goes down on an
influence of frame job okay so it's a
little bit later now and we spent a
lovely afternoon in town taking lots of
gorgeous photos for each other and it is
really exploring around the old town you
went to the palace which is just most
stunning building with this amazing
courtyard outside we're trying to find
some sorbets but I was unsuccessful
suppose they've that till tomorrow and
then we just have an hour of those
children rooms I did a little bit of
filming took a few more photos because
this place is just so so genic and now
we are meeting at the crystal bar for
dinner I'll hopefully try and dissuade
someone to film my outfit for you guys
and show you a full look but yeah I've
been loving this place too recently it's
just so unlike me because it's a dark
color but I just had a really really
liking it and I'm teaming it with my to
Valentino accessories bag of the shoes
I'm gonna go and knock on Juliette's
door now and hope she can maybe take a
snap of me out on the balcony it's so
funny we were all just debating in the
back of the cab how US bloggers get
content anxiety which sounds so lame but
it's basically when you're surrounded by
so many beautiful things and so many
photo ops and you're worried that you
don't get the perfect photo please tell
me I'm not alone if you're also a
blogger and you get content anxiety and
driving me crazy but anyway we are
mention meeting in one minute so let's
go
look guys this is what happened
do
ah
so just got back to the room after such
and lovely evening with the reward style
girls we stayed in the hotel I went to
the crystal bar and then you called the
Miramar restaurant here in the hotel
Armitage and such a lovely meal all ate
so much food I had Chateaubriand I had a
risotto and then the most amazing
souffle and pistachio ice cream for
dessert
so feeling utterly spoiled very very
full and very very tired I really need
to edit this vlog so that I can leave it
uploading overnight so the Wi-Fi doesn't
calm cows and me in the middle of the
day I'm going to try and do as much
editing as I can before I fall asleep
it's 10:00 to midnight which for me as a
granny is super duper late so I'm going
to say good night and I'll see you guys
in the morning
for another fun day in a Monaco I think
they've got your trip and a nice lunch
the beach club so it's going to be
amazing Stephanie stick around for
tomorrow thank you so much for watching
to get a thumbs up if you liked it and
I'll see you max on right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
