I say he always does it and I'm trying
to start my vlogs and yeah blocked over
part eight I think right now my hair is
doing something really strange so I
thought I'd start the vlog now because I
think it might get a little bit manic
later and I might not be able to do that
little introduction speech but today is
gonna be quite busy
I've got a lunch with a beauty brand and
then two afternoon teas I'm not really
sure how I'm going to manage that but
we'll find a way and then I'm getting my
makeup done ready for tonight because I
see we'll have seen by the title and the
thumbnail and tonight is the as darkness
falls party with gleam which is
basically if you don't know what game is
it's the agency or agent that look after
like the biggest youtubers so hopefully
it's going really fun evening
I'm really excited I've got my bag
packed up there which has got a wedding
dress in it not totally well I guess it
is a real one I got it from a charity
shop I'm sure you guys might be thinking
why if you've got a wedding dress but as
you'll see later and it's quite a garish
not the kind of thing that I would wear
to get riding but each to their own so
yeah I got my wedding dress with me and
my makeup for tonight although I'm
actually getting my makeup done
professionally or properly by Illamasqua
so even masks do makeovers on counter
before Halloween they're really hard to
book though so booked one in now if you
haven't got one already hasn't been
doing Selfridges and also the big street
store which is where I'm later haven't
actually decided what I'm gonna do on my
face I was gonna be going for a zombie
bride so I might just check a little bit
of Pinterest before before I go and meet
them so yeah this morning I got up super
duper early I was outta bed at 5 o'clock
in the morning because I had so much to
do today
I added yesterday's vlog and today's
blog post which was all about Tom Ford
makeup which by the way I'm obsessed
with this mascara and brows not lipstick
as she's an urban decay but yeah check
out that blog post because it's new
favorite of mine um and then this
morning Dexter he's Courtney yeah baby
he's fine now
but oh my god had me panicking so much
because he decided to eat a live wasp
from the floor so I obviously
tried to stop him and my fingers in his
mouth to try and rent you out but he'd
swallowed it and then he was having a
bit of a Liam like a spouse on the floor
but I rang the back straightaway and
they said not to worry and to take him
in later if he doesn't get any better so
Charlie's just got home and Troy's gonna
be looking after him while I go out
because I have to leave now in fact I
have to leave right now so I will catch
you guys a little bit later just
appreciate how beautiful animals wanna
see you bugging Joan
and so I feel like we should come here
just for the yeah so just had a lovely
afternoon tea at the lager with the
girls from blacker cosmetics it's really
lovely yeah it stays quite busy so we're
basically going to my brows done in the
star
or the lashes put on yet so now starting
with the face I just had the Hydra Bell
of primer on and it's like a jelly
consistency and because I've got the
strange poor situation
it's just settled into the pores which
hopefully will make my makeup last all
night and base is done we've had the
skin base Gila monster foundation what
else do we use a light colored concealer
which was professionally contoured in a
way that I could never do and then
what's and then a translucent powder and
Elise accept it and oh my gosh I needs
to try and recreate this base
they
to finish look I absolutely love it the
blood is so cool it looks really like
cartoony I technically makeup as ever
looked this cool thank you master
so just got to the hotel I've got my
makeup done I was having such a stress
in the taxi because it was like 25
minutes and it was just down the road
and I was so worried that the girls
gonna be all done and all its just gonna
be panicking I used to have a nightmare
when I was little about not being ready
for my school prom and I was starting to
have that nightmare in the taxi I think
is like not gonna say anxiety so like I
shouldn't open I was but anyway I was
stressing basically but I'm here I'm
gonna start doing my hair now because
that situation and the girls not gonna
hang around because we're getting ready
or ruin the surprise but the girls
getting ready and so I've just sprayed
my hair after curling it as you can see
quite liking the great hair that I used
the clothes accessories gray hair spray
but I'm gonna say that it did not cover
all of my hair but quite a lot of hair
and quite thick so two or even three
bottles because as you can see it goes
blonde towards the back if I just focus
on the front because I'm yeah that's a
girl said that selfie
should I go gray okay I think I'm just
about ready you got the bail on my
husband flat which there's nothing I can
do about it but the fail as a little bit
of volume don't you recognize let me go
to a mirror and I can give you look of
the evening excuse the disgusting
lighting um yeah so that's a bail half
gray half two on task and then no white
shoes
just be very dressed
