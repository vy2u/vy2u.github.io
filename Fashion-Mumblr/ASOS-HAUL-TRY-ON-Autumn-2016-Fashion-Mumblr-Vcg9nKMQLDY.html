for joining me for another haul here on
my youtube channel so you guys are
probably getting quite familiar with
seeing hauls over here and I feel like I
have to explain myself so of course it
is the change of seasons it's that
transitional weather time where it's
warm it's cool it's definitely the time
of you and we start to see the autumn
trends coming in and it does make me
feel a little bit spendy I have to admit
I do feel quite materialistic sometimes
I must counteract that by saying that I
do send a lot of this back your opinions
mean the world to me and I really do
read the comments take it all into
consideration and spend a lot of it back
but having said that it's fashion week
coming up and that is my number one
excuse for a lot of these upcoming
purchases so not sure if you've seen my
misguided haul yet but I have got a top
shop a sauce and misguided haul coming
for you around this week so make sure
you're subscribed I will leave a little
link to subscribe to my channel for not
already if you don't want to miss any of
those videos as well as my other beauty
travel lifestyle type of videos I feel
as though I need to counteract all this
materialistic goodness with some
positive energy so why don't we all just
take a few moments and think about one
thing that you're grateful for this
happened to you today
so don't let me just do somewhere and I
want you guys to do this as well it can
be one really small thing maybe maybe
your friend lent you 10 P that you
needed to get what you wanted for lunch
or maybe a stranger smother you or said
something nice to you on the street
complimented you on your shoes think of
one thing that is positive that happened
to you today and just be grateful for it
just take a moment to think yeah that
was really lovely that happened and I'm
grateful for it I like to think the one
thing that I'm grateful for at the end
of each
des and just a really lovely way of
attracting more positive energy to you
so for me today I am grateful that the
Sun decided to shine when I'm filming
because it means that the lighting is a
lot better I'm grateful thank you son
I'm grateful for you coming out I'm
grateful and my emails aren't too crazy
my inbox isn't too ridiculous this
morning because it always makes me feel
a little bit calmer if I can be on top
of my emails and I'm grateful for
Charlie for bringing me these beautiful
flowers he just said I know you're
filming today and you like to have
flowers in the background so that was
really lovely of them so that's three
positive things I'm grateful for today
so I hope you guys manage to think of
one thing and yeah a nice little
positive note start video on so I'm now
going to get started with the a sauce
haul a lot more positive things coming
your way lots of lovely wonderful
fashion pieces these are a mixture
actually there's nothing too expensive
here at all really it's mostly
affordable pieces that are really on
trend for autumn so nice inexpensive
ways of getting your wardrobe updated
for the autumn trends so without further
ado let's see when I pick it up recently
from a felf car I've got a bag and a box
by the feel of it it feels like this is
just fabric in here for no accessories
so I'm going to take my scissors
something just on the floor not sure
what that was I'm finding scissors
really hard to use the moment I grated
my hands when I was making carrot birch
at the other day and yes apologies
around doing this a little bit in a
special way okay
immediately I can see lots of my kind of
colors some blush some white and some
even though this autumn trends are
necessary those colors you guys know
that they are my colors so no matter
what season I'll always find a way of
incorporating them let's have a look at
the individual items after telling me
this is going to be an affordable haul
the first thing that I picked up is
actually from Ted Baker's this won't
have been that affordable but I thought
I would pick this oh god it was 149
pounds but I'll tell you why I decided
to spend that much on this piece and it
is a silk frontage and a do you want to
say polo neck because I don't feel like
silk can be a polo neck but as you can
see it's a very high neck it's got these
two buttons on front it is silk on the
front the whole body of this on the
front is silk and the arms and the back
are jersey material and the reason why I
thought potentially I could justify that
amount of money on this is because it's
sort of thing that I can imagine getting
lots of use out of and I think it is a
wardrobe classic especially when it gets
a little bit cooler work wear in
particular if you do like to spend a
little more on the clothes you wear
every day for work or perhaps school
then this is a really lovely option
because it is white or goes so many
things smarten up a pair of denim jeans
or potentially with a beautiful pair of
patterned trousers and I'm hoping this
winter we're going to get some really
beautiful you know Zara they often bring
out high-waisted trousers with really
opulent prints on them like feather
detail or like peacock feather colors so
yeah I thought that it was the look I
had in mind when I picked up this so
let's give it a try and see how it looks
on
so from a brand that I often find is a
little overpriced Ted Baker to a brand
that I had not really tried anything
from before and I actually thought there
was a mistake in the price of this
because I thought surely that is meant
to be 300 pounds not 30 pounds I think
this was 39 pounds and it's a firm in
there but I mean I'm presuming it folks
out there because of the price
leather jacket leather leather leather
jacket from pullin bear via a sauce
firstly this color is just my color you
guys know I love blush pink and I've
only got one leather jacket in my
wardrobe and it's brown I do wear it and
want say a locks they learn a lot but I
like it and I thought for 39 pounds I
would just love to add a pink one into
my collection so I got this and really
really pleased to their quality wise it
looks really lovely got lots of design
details and the color I'm really really
pleased with its beautiful soft and
spongy so let's give it a try
holy moly you guys I am in love with
this jacket it is so perfect and I
cannot believe how nice it is for price
tag the fit is a little on the big side
but just fine because I want to wear
some knitwear underneath it the color
I'm obsessed with I cannot believe how
many nice design details that are on a
jacket which is under 40 pounds
you've got zips here you've got
silverware you've got zips on the
pockets you've got a little belt detail
running through the sides of the back
the only thing I do wish is that it had
press studs to keep v/o does it oh no it
doesn't i wish i had precedents to keep
these in place because i feel like they
look nicer when they lie flat let me
show you what it looks like when i do it
up
so just as smart and lovely when it is
done up I feel like this is quite a big
expanse of material but lucky you've got
this little pocket detail here yeah I
just think this is so amazing if you are
tempted by this then I'm pretty sure
it's going to start soon I will leave a
link to it down below
go go go is all I'm saying because this
is a serious bargain and yeah I'm going
to wear this a lot this next piece is
just so stunning I picked it up because
I don't actually have an occasion in
mind to wear it and it is this beautiful
light pink dress from coast I don't have
an occasion in mind to wear it but I
thought it was very me when I saw it on
the website I just thought that's the
kind of thing that I'd like to have in
my wardrobe for those occasions where
suddenly a dinner crops up and you
potentially don't have anything to wear
and you just want to reach for something
that you know looks good so I'm hoping
this is going to turn into one of those
pieces 95 pounds so not cheap but not
expensive for a lovely evening dress I
do like to re wear my evening dresses
I'm definitely not one of these people
that can only wear a dress once because
that's just frivolous in my opinion so
hopefully this will be one that are
potentially wear for maybe a few late
summer dinners and then potentially next
summer I could wear it for a few
weddings christenings even summer
barbecues things like Ascot races so
yeah a really beautiful dress and I'm
excited to give this a try this dress is
just absolutely gorgeous I feel like it
is so me I love the length of it it's
really elegant but still feminine at the
same time I think it's really flattering
how it fits the bodice here and then it
flares out just a tiny
nothing into major and this beautiful
material just feels like it's quite long
lasting if that makes sense is nothing
in delicates that's going to pull I just
think it's a really beautiful feminine
design and bow it's so pretty
I can definitely see myself getting a
lot of use out of this for weddings
events christenings etc for many Springs
and summers to come so definitely one
just to store in the wardrobe for those
special occasions and the last thing in
that bag was this which is a Ted Baker
handbag really liking Ted Baker at the
moment but I do send quite a lot of
their things back because because of the
price tag I feel like it has to be
perfect so this is tissue wrap and
inside you can see this you can see this
beautiful colored clutch or like
shoulder bag I'm hoping this yeah so
you've got this beautiful rose gold
chain straddling in the side which is
just so stunning
I love the Ted Baker rose color it's
such a vivid rose gold not subtle in the
slightest it really is quite pink love
the color of this is so practical but I
have to say on the outset looking back
I'm about 80 percent sure this is going
to be sent back firstly because it's 99
pounds um and yeah I'm not made of money
so yeah and secondly you will see very
soon I have treated myself to something
that I've wanted for a long long long
long time and I'll be doing an unboxing
video very soon so when you see that
video you'll know why I'm sending this
back or potentially selling this bag but
as always I'll go to try paps of the
coast dress so you can get an idea of
how it looks on and next I'm going to
attack the box so let's see what is
inside here which is the rest and the
bulk of my ASIS order you know you've
got an a sauce problem when they can't
even fit
one box I used to think that if I got
this box and that was like Josie you've
gone a little bit wild but now my
definition of a masterpiece or haul is
when not only the box is an artifice
and key dokie I'm already seeing lots of
black little boxes which means I've been
going to spend your on accessories I'm
not necessarily going to spend it
because they're quite inexpensive first
of all in this box is a necklace from
Aldo and I actually picked this up
because I flew it look really lovely
when it does starts really cool down and
we start wearing high neck pieces that
are quite plain because I feel like this
whole like tummy chest rib area is quite
bare when you wear a high neck pieces
during winter so this necklace let me
take that the packaging between there we
go you can see it a bit better now
hopefully it is a very very delicate
thin gold chain with a quite large
circle at the end of it not dissimilar
in pattern to this one this one's from
Pandora I always leave it like that
envelopes I wear it most days and yeah
so this one's Pandora and this one is
Aldo so a fraction of the price it's a
lot more delicate and feminine and
dainty but it also has these crystals
around the edge of the circle so really
really beautiful and oh I thought it had
crystals on the chain as well but it
doesn't it's a plain chain clean chain
so this is really delicate it's
definitely not a bold piece should be
quite easy to slot into autumn wardrobe
and an inexpensive piece I'm sure get a
lot of use out of this one from Aldo via
a sauce in this second little box is a
ring also from Aldo I didn't have ever
shopped in Aldo before at all that's
what I just love about a sauce you
discover these brands and products that
potentially you wouldn't have even gone
on their website before so that's why I
love it and this ring is quite unusual
it is like a leaf it's like a really
long leaf that's been stretched out and
then called around to create a ring and
once again in winter your hands are
often visible
or not winter autumn the hands of
visible whereas your body is quite
covered so I like to decorate my hands
and this looks really stunning very
quite simple design but really effective
on it so I will show a close-up of this
and once again really good price so very
pleased with that little purchase and
the final accessory that I can see so
far is this stunning baby pink and rose
gold watch from new look and you may
remember um before I went to Greece I
picked up another watch from new look
from ASOS and they're really so
inexpensive not not pricey at all and no
needs and have a price on here I think
they're less than 20 pounds when you in
surprise me if they're like $12.99 or
maximum 25 pounds but this one is just
absolutely beautiful and again very me
this color is just my favorite beautiful
word delicate and I love that the strap
isn't too thick either so great if you
have small slim wrists and you don't
want a big bulky watch overpowering you
simple watch face it doesn't have any
look branding all over it which no
offense a new look but it does kind of
ruin it rebrand take heed you do not
need to put your branding all over
everything um and yeah very delicate
simple design looks a lot more expensive
than it was and just a classic and I
love it next is an item of clothing and
this one is covered in tissue paper
there we go this one is a roll neck top
or a polo top I really need to learn the
actual definition of these tops there's
too many names floating around and this
one is a Miss Selfridge brand you will
probably already know what I'm going to
say about the color very me but also
slightly more autumnal it's got some
slightly deeper tones in there it is a
it's almost like a dog tooth design but
it's not is definitely not Azzam defined
as that but yeah just very easy to slot
into a wardrobe type of item and
something that will keep you lovely and
warm during those slightly cooler months
so I am completely obsessed with the
color of this top I think is so me just
absolutely love this kind of of pink
blush color it's almost a little bit
Brown II very very wearable and I
paired it with this gold skirt which i
think is just absolutely beautiful as
well really like the high neck it's
thicker material as well so it's going
to be nice and warm throughout the
cooler months I can definitely wear a
thermal underneath it I also think I
need to wear it with a bra without any
padding because I think that can make it
look quite chunky which it's definitely
not so yeah the smaller boobs the better
and this I think because I find
otherwise because there's no detail on
them there can be a little bit top-heavy
looking so yeah just one tip try and
make your bust as small as possible when
wearing this kind of top but yeah love
this and will definitely wear it a lot
in the coming of cooler months something
a little bit more snazzy also from Miss
Selfridge via ASOS is this off the
shoulder top and I actually forgot that
I'd pick this up from resource and
nearly bought it in the shop the other
day but then decided it couldn't be
bothered to queue and so yeah it's this
off the shoulder top it's got this
little Bardot frill detail I think it's
a look really nice just for aid an
autumnal evening when you want something
a little bit more snazzy but still maybe
want to wear jeans so again I will give
this a try and show you how it looks on
this top is so cute I just love the
color I love this a little bit kind of
partyish because it's got these silver
metallic stripes running through it but
you've still got this trend of the
off-the-shoulder Bardot style which is
not going anywhere
I just find a style of top really
flattering really feminine and getting
caught up in the labels and it's really
really easy to wear I also really like
it with jeans I think it's just a nice
way of dressing up a pair of jeans but
more than anything I just love the color
I feel like it's so pretty so feminine
and yeah it's really lightweight as well
so great for those end of summer like
warm
Indian summer days so yeah I think I'll
definitely treat myself to keeping the
okay this next item is something that I
basically picked up as a cozy treat to
myself because I know that as the
weather starts to cool down and we spend
a lot longer in the house working from
home and I'm going to want to be snuggly
so I picked up these jogging bottoms
from a saw snail cream they've got these
flower prints all over them and I can
just envisage getting a lot of wear out
of these so I know they're going to fit
because they're super stretchy I'll try
them on for you guys anyway these are
just the coziest things in the whole
world
I love these I'm going to keep on
wearing them after I finish filming
they've got a really big waistband
really like chunky waistband which is
just so snuggly and I also feel like the
other kind of material which isn't going
to bobble so I really like that they're
kind of like slim fitting down the
bottom they're tapered they're not all
baggy and yeah I don't we have a
negative thing to say about these so
definitely a keeper that's really random
I don't remember ordering this at all it
is a long-sleeve navy blue shirt really
not my color at all I wonder if this is
actually a mistake I'm just going to
check for a seat that's really weird
it's not on the receipt either unless
they categorize this as a midi dress
surely that's not long enough to be
addressed I don't know I'm going to put
that one to one side and deal with that
later I mean if you get things with a
mistake
do you send them back because you're not
going to get a refund or do I just keep
it
I don't know moral dilemma feel like I
probably quite that comment to keep it
wouldn't it this next one is really cute
and it is a very kind of it's almost a
yellowy of whitus I'm gonna even call it
beige it's kind of like a vanilla color
skirt and then as you can see on the
pockets you've got these two pockets on
the front they've got this beautiful
little frill detail around the edge so
really lovely and feminine
I think potentially if your style is
quite similar to mine and you have to
wear something fairly smart for school
or for work then this would be a really
lovely one for that it's quite short so
maybe not one to wear if you're super
tall I think maybe even I have a petite
version and so yeah really lovely a
little skirt I will try this on
not short top - try this on with maybe
that new Miss Selfridge right so let's
give this a try
I think this skirt is really really cute
it's actually a ton on the big side I
did get the size 6 and it's actually a
little bit big for me so if you're
between sizes then maybe go down a size
but yeah I think it's adorable it's
actually not as short as I thought it
was going to be is it fairly well I mean
it's not a long skirt but it's not you
know it's not going to relieve anything
and I think these pockets are just
absolutely adorable it's just yeah it's
definitely a winner I think this is
really nice work look but also a nice
look for shopping or lunch with the
girlfriends so yes very pleased with
this one from ASOS and then this is
something that I'm really really excited
to try on and it is from warehouse but
obviously inspired by a certain Miss
Hudson it's portrait self-portrait
design and it is this gorgeous dress I
would say the length is probably going
to be about halfway up my calves and
then a little bit tighter around the
bodice with this much lighter material
here at the top and then the lace
overlay going down from the bustard
downwards it's got a cute little kind of
Peter Pan style collar
zip up in the back so really well-made
actually and this was obviously a lot
cheaper than these self-portrait dresses
would be so I'm intrigued to see how
this will look on so let's give it a try
I'm a little bit undecided about this
one I feel like the length is
potentially not the best for me it's a
little bit long I do love the pattern
and I do love how similar it is to those
sub portrait designs I think the top
section is not my favorite material this
lighter material but the rest of the
design details I really do like I don't
really wear this powder blue color
either so I'm not too sure if it suits
me but let me know what you guys think
this one it's quite a statement piece as
well so could I get away wearing it for
more than one or two occasions that is
definitely something that has crossed my
mind
the next thing I've opened up is from
the brand new look to know I said from
the brand you guys know what the new
look is and it is a plain gray roll neck
top I'm a little disappointed in how
thin this is because roll necks normally
need them to super warm but having said
that it's a really good staple to have
your wardrobe can wear thermal into nice
is good for layering in those cooler
months and it's the kind of thing I get
a lot of use out of so I'm not going to
be too upset that it's not a little bit
thicker having said that it probably is
quite warm and yes a good layering piece
so this is kind of thing you could wear
once again with high-waisted skirt I
wasted trousers and something that gets
a lot of use in the autumn and winter
months let's say so do you think I could
get away with being one of those cool
girls that doesn't pull their hair out
and then pretends it's a faux bob yeah I
don't think so definitely not cool
enough but talking about the top I
really really like this color I think
the gray is very flattering it very
wearable and a nice way of bringing some
pastel colors into your autumn wardrobe
because personally I like to keep things
lights no matter what the season
having said what I said about material I
actually do find it quite warm and
because it's thin you could definitely
layer on top of it and not get too
overheated put a thermal underneath it
and I'm pretty sure you would stay nice
and snugly but not go too hot if you're
in an office or on the underground I
just think this color is really lovely
and feminine and paired with white skirt
or white trousers it's a really lovely
light colored autumn winter look so yes
very very pleased with this one and I
think it is a keeper I think this is the
exact same thing in black yes it is a
black high neck jumper from I don't want
to say jumper because it's not warm
enough to be a jumper hi next stop from
new look another great layering piece
black is even more wearable in winter
than gray although this year I mean I
know that black isn't sleep nice and
pretty and try and wear the grey a
little bit more but yeah another
wardrobe staple for the cooler months
then I have a pair of jeans these are
from warehouse and I was tempted to put
these or I was did put these in my
basket because it said ultra skinny I'm
not sure if you've seen my misguided
haul yet but if you have your no-go
picked up quite a lot of has jeans from
that and it just reminded me of how
classic a pair of jeans makes your
outfit look like really easy to throw on
and just a staple in your wardrobe so I
thought no harm in getting another pair
and these did say ultra skinnies I
thought they would be quite flattering
and they do look nice and skinny with a
little bit of stretch to them so I'm
excited to give these a try and
hopefully there might be another autumn
wardrobe staple so the jeans fit really
really nicely they're very snug they're
a little bit tricky to get on but that's
always a good sign if you don't want
them falling down and midway through
your shopping spree they fit really snug
all the way down quite elastic and I
also really liked that they're one block
color I feel like it's a little bit more
flattering and they're a little bit
longer so I
might either take them up or I might
just give them a snip because raw edges
are very much in style this season feel
like they fit really nicely on the bomb
as well they just fit in all the right
places and yeah you can never have too
many great shooting pairs of jeans in my
opinion this is without a doubt the most
random thing in the entire shopping hall
but hear me out okay so I picked up this
beautiful dusky baby pink satin
fascinator as in like hats fascinator
and the reason why I bought this is
because when it comes that time of year
I know not everybody does this but when
it comes to time of year when it seems
like escorts and horse races and like
polo you need to have something on your
head and weddings of course like that's
something that most of us go to weddings
and you need to have something on your
head a lot of these occasions so I added
this to my basket because at that time
of year it can be a bit of a rush and
you don't wanna be wearing the same as
everybody else so I thought this would
go with a lot of things I tend to wear
too those sorts of occasions so very
easy to wear color it could go in white
things it could go with navy black pink
obviously so yes I thought this is
really lovely and it is just a sauce
own-brand I think it was about 23 pounds
it's got these little kind of floppy
bunny ears a bit of lace in there and
yeah I just thought this would be a
really lovely thing to store up in my
loft until next season although there
might be a few things left going on this
year but just thought I would add this
to my basket because I know that next
time I need one this is going to come in
really really handy I can't believe how
much it is still in this box I'm sorry
if this hole is going on for a long time
I'll try and film my
Tryon section is quite quickly this I'm
not sure what it is but it's from Nuala
let's have a look okay I do remember
this so this is a high next top but
still very summery and it is in this
beautiful pleat material which I
absolutely love as you guys know I wear
it a lot it's probably my favorite
fabric texture if that makes sense and I
thought this is really beautiful with a
high neck very elegant and feminine will
look gorgeous with jeans or there's any
end of summer holidays or if not I'm
just going to pack this away until next
summer I'll give this a try as you can
see how this looks on this is such a
beautiful blouse and so me I can
definitely see myself getting a lot of
wear out of this one I do have something
fairly similar but it's strappy but the
same pleating material and I wear it in
loads and I feel like this kind of high
neck makes it a bit more appropriate for
the season that we're coming into it's
just so flirty and feminine and yeah
I definitely keep it for me what do you
guys think do you like it as much as I
do
or am I just crazy keeping something
like this when we're coming into autumn
let me know so I've been really excited
to open this one up because it is an
autumn trend we're already starting to
see coming through and it's the Western
trend so I picked up this belt from new
look it was $4.99 I mean come on the
Gucci ones are like probably 400 pounds
but it's this western style belt I
thought I'll just look gorgeous with my
jeans I think yeah that jeans is pretty
much everything you can get away with
wearing this weird like denim perfect
style for what's in China this season
it's $4.99 so you just can't really go
wrong with this and I'm sure you'll be
seeing me wearing this a lot in the
coming weeks and months
so keeper on my Instagram if you want to
see how I style it next and we are
coming to the end I promise is this gold
skirt so I picked this up because I
thought it would look really lovely with
just like a plain top either a t-shirt
or one of these polo necks on and
picking up and I love the color I don't
think I have anything this color my
water of at all it's gold as you can see
really beautiful gold
it's not finished very well at the
bottom actually this is quite badly
I mean aces own brand can be quite poor
quality sometimes I feel like I'm not
gonna be able to see there's too much
and that is reflected in the price
thankfully it's not too expensive at all
so yeah I'm gonna give this a try or
maybe style it with one of the high
necks you can see I mean with that kind
of vibe and shoe wise I probably wear
heeled mules if you've got any of those
all kind of open toe boots if you've got
any of those so yeah I'm going to give
this a try so you can see how it looks
on I'm so much more in love with this
skirt than I even thought I would be the
color is just stunning it's just so
eye-catching so different and for a
magpie like me it's just so beautiful I
really like it paired with this pink top
as well I think the colors work really
beautifully together so lovely and
flowing and a really elegant length too
I mean just look how it's shining it's
so pretty I think that I probably
wouldn't have gone for this combination
but actually seeing them now I really
really like them so what do you guys
think can I get away with wearing this
kind of thing this autumn let me know
and last but not least is a dress from
boohoo so I don't regularly go on the
boohoo website I don't find that many
things that I love from them but I feel
like a sauce pick out the best pieces
and oh so our dress is a jumpsuit took
you for God for this is a dress and
again that kind of self-portrait vibes
going on at the top here with this
cutout lace detail the collar and the
black lace detail going down the middle
and then it actually looks fairly well
fitted to the body you've got these nice
pocket details and a nice pleat going
through the middle so this is really
hard to show you guys on camera without
stretching up something go ahead
and give this a try so this is a really
tricky one because I absolutely love it
I think it looks really cool and if I
worked in like a fashion office or like
nest Porto or something like that
then I would definitely wear this as
like a real work outfit or if I had like
smart meetings to go to not going to
have meetings I can definitely get over
jeans then I would 100% wear this but I
feel like it's almost too nice and I
just don't have anywhere to wear it
because I personally would wear a
monochrome outfit to go out for dinner
so it's not really good for that but I
do love this top detail very so portrait
again but for those amazing boohoo
prices so I love it but I'm not sure if
I'm going to keep it just because I just
don't see where I'm going to wear it so
that is everything though I picked up in
my pre London Fashion Week shopping haul
from a source calm I hope you guys

haul as lots of pieces I'm really really
