me for another haul videos that's going
to be an exile tool and it's a little
while since I did one but this is
actually going to be a double a phone
call I have two shopping bags down my
feet this is also my first standing up
tall so hopefully it's going to go well
logistically holding things up etc as
I've got two bags to go through I'm not
going to hang around too much I'm just
going to get straight back in there but
before I get started I would just like
to let you know that I have tons and
tons of fashion videos coming up loads
of holes with lookbooks loads of trends
ideas so how to bring all channel trends
into your wardrobe things like that so
make sure to hit the subscribe button
down below so you don't miss out on any
of those upcoming videos so that's
further ado let's get started as I said
I have two april I'm going to get
started in Islam so the bits that I've
been picking up are kind of end of
summer early autumn pieces with a few
miscellaneous turn in for good measure
this really caught my eye and it's a
brand that I've not heard of before it's
a brand called rare girl or rahi know
that pub bar my eyesight is it says
rocky cow he is the name of this brand
and this is like a rowboat dressing gown
with a beautiful faux fur lining on the
edge there big faux fur thieves and I
really love this floral pattern it's
real lightweight materials they're
really good end-of-summer autumnal piece
quite lightweight for walking around in
the house also this faux fur will keep
it really cozy I was just looking
something a little bit different to your
traditional dressing gown I spend a lot
of time in a house wearing my dressing
yarns every night to invest in something
a little bit more unusual so I will pop
this on and let you know how it looks
the robe is absolutely gorgeous I'm
definitely keeping this love the colors
I love the faux fur around sleeves is so
soft and cozy just literally like those
resource like a team gasps that's you
love it
nice to have it around the neckline as
well it does have this time waist I've
got it on over spring costume which you
guys will be seeing very very shortly
lengthwise it's pretty short it's
probably more of a posing dressing gown
than a keeping you warm dressing gown I
hang for that I do feel quite touched in
it but yeah it's not going to be
one that will keep you snuggly into the
depths of winter but for this time of
year I think it's really really nice
just love this material and love the
colors and yeah very smitten with my
slightly different dressing-gown by the
way everything and that I am talking
about as well as everything that I'm
wearing and even stuff that's in the
background will all be listed down in
description box below so for any
information just check that out there's
also information on the camera that I'm
filming this on which by the way I
actually have a 25% off code for and
it's for the olympus pen ep-1 lenses so
yeah leave the link down below so if
you're looking to get a new camera or
upgrade your photographer games then
that little excuse not sponsored by the
way but I just thought I will let you
know and so this piece is also from the
same brand raw girl or Russian Callie
whoever I call it and it's the same kind
of pattern that this is actually a
summer dress again I just thought great
for late summer holidays almost an
autumnal style you could definitely pair
this with maybe some boots for autumn
with another jacket that kind of thing
and yeah really good for the holidays
it's got a cinched in waist and it's
also elastic ational and sleeves so you
could really pull them up and create a
very sleek effect but I just saw the
colors are really really beautiful and
I'm forever finding ways of making pink
a little bit more tumble and I feel like
this is a really good way to do it
got ruffles down at the bottom as well
so really lovely floaty style very
bohemian very Ibiza succubus go and
let's see how it looks I am absolutely
in love with this dress I love the
colors I love this material and I love
how like floaty and country and
elasticated it is because it's got the
elastication waist
it's super easy to put on an off and
sometimes I find rest like this can be a
little bit stuffy but this wasn't at all
the elastic on these please mean you can
pull it up and wear it like a delivery
sleeve or you can pull them down
depending on what you prefer
love or disclosure material it just
feels so whimsical and I'm a definitely
stylist in fact if you are thinking of
not buying anymore summer dresses
because you won't wear them anymore and
with japanese-style this point with a
suede jacket like this one for the
autumn so yeah absolutely love this
really impressed so comfy I just feel
like I'd wear this a lot on upcoming
summer holidays well late summer
holidays in the evenings or if you're
going on any really late summer holidays
you're not sure it's going to be super
warm and evenings and this is a really
great one because it's so much fabric
you would definitely keep warm against
any cheesy breezes I obviously got very
tired away on that brand because this is
also the same brand it's a pink dress
again refloat eerily bohemian you can
see what kind of five they're going for
this has got kind of like a nice
paneling down sleeves and then you've
got this pattern almost reminds me of
you know ostrich skin and ostrich
leather handbags have like the dots on
them that's what this reminds me of but
the way that the light kind of flows
through is just really really beautiful
quite short a little bit shorter than
what I would usually go for but we will
give it a try
could be a really nice beach cover-up
and it does have a slip inside it too
this brand is not the most affordable I
think all of these pieces of over 100
pounds but nice if you do want to invest
in your holiday wardrobe in things of
your wear year after year this is a
ready really loving piece I just love
this color I feel like it's quite an
autumnal like dusky pink and the great
thing about this dress is that you can
wear it or style it how you like so I
have quite cinched it in the waist but
you can also undo this and then it hang
down and be your Chokey up and down
straight through it and love the make
some sleeves I love this material some
nice lengths it's quite short for me but
yeah really really like this definitely
one of the key things for minutes
holding
okay so this is actually a river island
piece but I picked it up from a source
so if you saw my Molly's from my
lookbook which i'll leave links up here
or even and - be fair outfit diaries
which maybe I can also link is not very
linked down below you'll have seen that
I have a bikini which is like this as
separate that I absolutely adore but the
bikini is coral down here
and more the kinky right up here at the
loved' it's no longer in stock so and I
just really love some in costumes I
thought I would try this very similar
style the only thing I'm concerned about
is this open they're here because I've
actually got first mark in this kind of
area and I don't really like it to be
framed in this kind of style voting
across but again a really nice sliding
Morel terminal colors for a swim suit so
great for these kind of would you call
it
no no just like make some style holidays
where the vibes are starting to get a
little bit more warm that kind of say I
am so so so happy with the zucchini are
awesome in costume it does not show my
birthmark which I'm really happy about
although if I pull it up a little bit I
probably would do it actually shows the
best part from my stomach I feel like
for all of us this is always a bit that
looks the most toned I had macaroni and
cheese in an honest burger yesterday and
still somehow makes me look a turn so it
must be some kind of magic but yeah
really really like this it's good on the
old bottom
I find this Spanish style so flattering
really really like this love the colors
so perfect and like autumnal that's
still sorry at the same time and yeah I
just feel great in this it feels like
it's hugging me in all the right places
and yeah despite my bad diet recently I
think it looks pretty good although I
have to say it is completely flattened
my boobs if you don't have boobs then
it's not going to give you honey this is
another beachy style piece it's quite a
long address from a brand called bash or
ba and SH and not sure how you say it
but it's quite like a safari style very
Laura asked you've got a tie and at the
waist quite shirt like detail on the
sleeve
Fenny long as well they'd be going
anywhere high conservative maybe in
Morocco that kind of place then this
could be a really good option for that
it's very stylish an elegant piece of
Beach well but again you could wear this
into the autumn with boots with a
leather jacket so a pretty versatile
piece let's give it a try and even iron
but we'll have to envisage where it
looks like after being eyes of
okay so I can definitely see where this
is going and who it would look good on
and the vibe but I just don't feel like
this is totally me it is definitely a
holiday piece or a funnel very chic work
piece but I feel like we've kind of gone
past a time of year that I really get a
lot of use out of this what I do love is
this really long cuff on a please I
think that's really elegant I love the
color I love the shape the blouse but
then I feel like from here down it just
goes a little bit you know they kind of
stopped thinking about the design detail
down there and just not sure how this
guy works and it is quite an expensive
piece I'm not sure I'm going to keep
this so from one price extreme to
another this is a piece from new look
and it looks really cool on the model it
actually looked very self-portrait in a
self-portrait top which is asymmetric
off your shoulder in striped material
this is definitely along those kind of
lines of hoping that I could get that
kind of look for the distraction of a
price this one I think was around 20
pounds and have a label on anymore again
it needs ironing but I think with white
jeans this could look very very stylish
so let's give it up so this top is
incredibly similar to the self-portrait
it hangs in pretty much exact same way I
am in fact really really impressed with
this I think it's a really really lovely
a great way to wear the shirt trend if
you are a little bit more feminine as
well personally I have worn the shirt
trend at all this year but I would
definitely be very happy wearing this
because it's a super go we will the
thrill' detail got a little bit of
shoulder showing through you Bob
seacoast beautiful Russell same as these
self portrait girls and I think with
white jeans it looks really really great
the only slight issue I have with this
topic but you have to undo the bottoms
on the teens knowledge going on but then
I think I preferred sleeves rolled up a
little bit anyway so yes definitely
keeping this one another more affordable
piece this time a pair of qalaat style
trousers from boohoo
so I have a pair like this from Topshop
and also perform in Ireland and I went
so so so much this style trouser is so
comfortable I wasn't flying I wear them
as a slightly smarter
slobbing around the health childr as
opposed to like leggings but
absolutely love them these have got
really cool detail down at the bottom
like this kind of like a cinched in
water cause I like paper bag effect down
at the bottom give them a nice little
extra design detail the only problem
that I usually help with this type of
chowder is that they are very very
see-through so you can really see what
kind of underwear you're wearing things
of course that won't be the same for
these this could be a nice or tunnel
update to pink one they're currently
apps in love in my wardrobe and that do
you need replacing they have so many
thread pane moves from puppy clothes
okay so I have paired the boo boo
trousers with plain white camisole which
is definitely so a way that I would
start these on like a holiday or in warm
days but as predict you'll notice
absolutely love them super comfy I love
how they hang really liked kind of wide
qalaat style super comfortable because
it's just so into room them they're our
last occasion as well which means you
can eat all of our key foods you want
really like the color nice awesome that
story lightweight summer as well they
are wearing black knickers and you can't
really see them they're not too clear
not to see-through but yeah they're
wearing to neon and mixing probably but
yeah II love these exactly all I wanted
so definitely going to be keeping them
this is an eighth soft own-brand piece
it's a shame they always look so
tattered when they come so scrambled I
mean it's not a good sign that it's so
crease because it doesn't mean that it
will need a lot of ironing but is this
very cute little beachy day dress and
what I also you loved is as bow detail
at the back which could look really nice
if you go times back when you're a
swimming costume
sister reform a little flirty played
suit which I think you could get a lot
of use out of on holiday the sleeves are
quite like fluted ruffle detail and then
you've got this gorgeous broderie
anglaise style down at the bottom I
start so you love broderie anglaise so
many pieces with that fabric in my
wardrobe I will give this a try I'm not
going to bother ironing it - let's try
this and fingers crossed it looks cute
because I think it could be one of those
pieces that you packing a suitcase and
you just wear time and time again when
you're on holiday okay I have not felt
this way in quite some time and I
genuinely feel like man dressed as lamb
in this because it's so short I feel
I've not worn anything this short since
I was about 16 and even then I think you
would have been a bit short for me my
job is literally here
therefore bend down and you will see my
bottom and then up here it's really cute
and girly with these 30 sleeves but I'm
25 and I know that's not old but I do
feel like a little bit young for me but
if you are in your teens or you have a
really cute style then into that city
colleges really like to bow at the back
it is going to need an iron and it would
be annoying every time you wash it that
does need ironing but it is a very very
cute design from the beach and I
actually love this broderie anglaise but
not one for me well we're on the subject
of holes I actually picked up with some
of the other day
it's got like a peacock on it but I just
have to love the cold handle got it from
Anthropologie and you love it and then
the last bit from that a soft parcel is
a vacuum head maker so it looks a little
something like this so it's a beautiful
pink blush suede saddlebag with a rose
gold clasp which I absolutely love this
color is absolutely beautiful
together with the rose gold so so pretty
it's got I think a chain strap inside so
let's open it up
tons of texturing as always yes you've
got this rose gold strap which means you
can wear it either on one side or
crossbody this is a kind of bag that's
just a really nice size and I can
picture myself getting lots of use out
of so I so I treat myself and I'll
probably just kind of leave this out
about for the next couple of weeks
see if I do actually pick it up to wear
it with a few of my items and here my
outfit because it's not a cheap piece
but I just felt like I wanted one final
pink behind you before we start going
into autumn winter styles but yeah I
always find two big pieces of really
lovely quality really well designed and
I'm just a sucker for pink and rose gold
so we are now on to the size number two
and this one is super heavy it's
absolutely so lodging at the scenes can
remember
at once so some look so I must have done
this hall on a cloudy and cold morning
this one's a lot more abdominal than the
previous one but first of all we have
this gorgeous knit so this looked
beautiful on the model actually features
it on my Instagram stories and because I
thought it's so beautiful it's almost
like a ballerina jumper and then it has
this crossover I think you'll probably
need a silk event or a lacy vest top to
wear underneath because it's pretty low
down pretty revealing and but yeah I
think of such a classic piece for a
winter wardrobe and it was very
affordable to so I'll give this a try
so you can see how it looks on this job
is absolutely adorable I feel like it
looks very chic with a crossover finish
really nice if you have a statement
necklace as well it really helps to
frame that and I wouldn't be comfortable
going out without something on
underneath unless I had a beautiful bra
on because this could slip at any point
and yeah I definitely think it's worth
looking for a best chocolate something
silky and riku to wear underneath it but
as far as nice wintry jumpers go this
one is a really really nice one and then
another miss this one is from Ted not
it's from French Connection I really
like buying my more premium pieces from
ASOS I just find the delivery super
quick and I don't know about you but if
I do want to return something I always
find it a lot easier to return to a
source than like the Ted Baker's Reese's
the French Connection so very grateful
for premium section on ASOS so this is
just a beautiful classic jumper to style
to kind of start you know you're going
to wear so much in the colder months I
know that last year I've reached my
white knit pieces so that's often you
guys know how much I like my white and
this is a restyle shape I really like
the high collar keeps you really talking
more and then you've got just very
simple style very flattering the way
that you've got the different diet
directions with the stripes you for
example and then it's a vertical stripe
so it should be a really easy to style
piece very chic very feminine very
stylish and very easy to wear on
multiple occasions in the winter okay
this is the French Connection jumper and
I absolutely love it I just think it's
such a stylish design it's actually a
asymmetric so the back section crops a
little bit higher than the front section
which I really like
again it's high next so I can wear all
my thermals underneath this just fits
absolutely beautifully I just love white
jumpers I went so much I don't think it
looks really elegant like if you have a
nice bracelet on like the one that I'm
wearing now I'll leave a link to it down
below it's us from you then I just think
it looks absolutely beautiful white and
rose gold is so stylish really like this
neckline and it will get makeup on it
but I find that if I use vanish then
that that'd be fine
so yeah definitely definitely keeping
this jumper and I guarantee I'll be
wearing this a lot in winter so this is
a bit of a wild card this is a pajama
top which is the river island that I
picked up from ASOS I did not find the
matching shorts mist which is going to
really bug me some may send some back
because I really like to wear matching
sets when I wear my pajamas I do really
like styled this it's got little tree
fluted sleeves of embroidery really like
the shirt detail and then this tie
section in the middle so a little bit
different to my usual shirt style like
silky pajamas it's very cute but it is
going to go back because I could not
find the matching shorts which is really
annoying okay this is very unlike me I
seem to have ordered something which is
not pink or white I think I may have
ordered this by mistake this isn't so
throw me but it is a jumper dress from
French Connection to really unusual
material quite nice actually
yeah it's a really nice length is navy
with a great contrast color different
Wireless it's so random I don't know to
be honest it could be one of those
pieces that you have in your wardrobe
and actually it's one of those outfits
that you just wear time and time again
especially for work in winter so and
give it a go but as you guys know I
don't usually wear dark colors so this
could be interesting this is actually
one of the coziest pieces I have ever
tried on it feels like I know you're
wearing a full-on jumper it's that cozy
I am not used to the dark material I'm
not going to lie I don't particularly
feel like it suits me but I think maybe
see
you know better than black I think I
probably want to keep this but if I was
still in my old job where I went to an
office every single day I would keep
this if you like this is the kind of
things I would wear on at least a weekly
basis to work really cozy is smart yet
come see a nice length as well it's not
like too short it's just above the knee
a really good length for work and I
think if you as the black tights and
boots or you swear this with stilettos
wherever your style is so an incredibly
versatile piece also really like the
length of the sleeves it is just above
the wrists so I'm gonna get in the way
it's with typing or eating or whatever
and really like the gray around the neck
as well this is a little bit less harsh
from the skin now the Navy so it's nice
and brightening for the face but yeah I
personally don't wear this style outfit
that much it's a little bit too smart
and I don't have any meetings that
require me to dress like this but if I
was still in my office job then I was
100% cuter this next one is a beautiful
place suit from whistles again on ASOS
I thought the tailoring on this looked
absolutely stunning
you've got these straps which clip-on I
think that's poppers but I can just tell
by the way the darts are that this
should be the most beautiful fit you've
got a little pocket and you've got some
open sections here and front pockets as
well oh my god okay that is disgusting
someone's tissue is in the pocket so
someone's obviously bought this worn it
out put a shoe in the pocket and then
sent it back styles discovered and can
maybe I'll send this on back and order
another one if it looks something
beautiful because that's pretty darn
gross oh my god has anyone else that I
had any weird experiences with online
shopping if you have some let me know in
comments down below because show me that
kind of thing must have some quite a lot
and what happens in the sound like money
in shelves and pockets
that would be very very lucky but yeah
moving on I thought that this is a
really nice or tundle jumpsuit some nice
kind of like smart work occasions or
just days anyone's dressed up a little
bit going out for dinner
friends that kind of thing and yeah a
really nice alternate a turn it is rural
with like captures cacti but yeah should
be a nice versatile piece which I will
try now
okay so despite the fact that I'm pretty
sure this has already been warned it
does also have a little bit of body odor
smell and not going to lie I tragedy
love this jumpsuit I think are not going
to moderate turning it and just going
wash it but yeah I absolutely loved it
it fits beautifully just as I predicted
it has darts and all the right places
that really really hugs the body I love
where the pockets are now tuition-free
is also got little pockets or a pocket
on the bottom yeah it is around here and
on the chest it fits the in the most
beautiful way it's like a glove and then
it's got little poppers here so you can
get it off really easily so yeah that's
how you get it or not for minutes cause
it's down the side here so I held the
camera down you can see the length it's
really nice length you could wear like
stilettos for an evening look or you
could dress it down with flat sandals as
well love the pattern love this material
is quite like a thick material very good
for autumn with like a big cozy cardigan
this could really be dressed down but
yeah really really big fan of this and I
can see myself getting a lot of wear out
of it which is great okay these next two
of both Jack Wills and they were down in
the sale ridiculously cheap and they're
the kind of thing that actually I find
myself wanting quite a lot from really
chilly mornings here in the UK when it
gets cold it gets really bitterly cold
and I find that my ears get really cold
so I really like head warmers and these
are last year's designs that they're in
sale on a sauce so we've got this
shearling one and it also does kind of
more rugged sheepskin one I wear these
quite a lot like when I go to watch
Charlie play rugby that kind of thing
just find them really really cute encode
these up one I think this one was about
fiver this one was a little bit more
expensive but just bit more substantial
let's give this a go
so cozy oh my god this is making me
excited for winter think I actually
prefer this one I think it goes my hair
color a bit more this one looks a little
bit more kind of try hardy and not sure
but yes I picked those up I will
probably only keep the water that I'm
liking I'm urging towards this one at
the moment but yes cut those a bit of a
bargain so if you also like cutting on
this then the links will be down below
so I am a big fan of Mauritius women
costumes or Maddy's yeah however you
pronounce it but they're very very
expensive so I didn't buy myself a new
one this year I've just been wearing my
last year's one which I still love but
then I saw this on a soft it's a brand
called South Beach and this is almost
identical to some of the mauricio
designs I thought I would get this give
it a try it was I think about 30 pounds
but if not it will be less than that so
a very affordable dupe for more easier
and it's got the scalloped detail it's
got the tie-up section in the middle
here and try and I are hopefully going
to positano at the end of this month and
then we'll also go into Catalonia in
September so a really nice very covering
because as I said not such a fun in
bikinis anymore very covering swimming
costume which hopefully will look great
with a tan so this one okay I absolutely
love this swimming costume but it is a
size too small it is pretty tight on me
like shoulder arm whole area so I
definitely need to size up for other
than the sizing issue absolutely love
this I feel like it's very much has
Murray's your vibes about it this whole
top area looks amazing the fact that
it's too small I've pulled it a little
bit so the padding on the boob area has
gone a bit strange but if you ignore
that fact I think it's gorgeous and this
sort of really deep tan fake or real is
going to look absolutely amazing so
Stephanie going to choose the next size
up for this for my upcoming holidays
these were also in sale they are a pair
of plain white jeans and Jack wheels
just very very plain very simple but
from my memory I seem to think that Jack
Wills denim fits me really well it has
quite a high elasticity content so nice
and tight and pretty good quality as
well it looks like they were 54 pounds
originally but I think I've got these
around 20 pound mark they don't have any
design detail
and Jack will tag on the back there
which is another these are these super
skinny crop Furnham style and I think
they should be cropped just above the
ankles which I find really nice
especially in autumn when you just want
something a little bit warmer but I find
this style so beautifully with things
like brown boots over knee boots
especially skinny jeans work really
nicely with boots oh yeah really nice a
new pair of white jeans that's my
collection do you have a few at the
moment but there were a little bit
tattered so nice to have a new pair
ahead of the autumn season so these are
the size 26 of the Jack Wills jeans and
even these I did actually struggle to
get on the zip is not very long which
means you don't have that much room to
pull them up over your hips I've got
quite wide hips and I did yeah I did
struggle but managed to get the 26 on
they are incredibly good quality I find
with white jeans if you want them to be
skinny but you go to achieve on the
material you can kind of see your muscle
above your knee which I always think
makes you look like a Michelin Man which
I hate but these are thick enough that
you don't see your muscle which sounds
weird but if you go I had really cheaper
iTunes you'll know what I'm on about so
yeah really impressed with these they
feel great quality they feel like
they're not going to lose their shape
any time soon and they fit really really
beautifully looks like I bought them in
two sizes just to see which one fits
first I've got 25 and 26 waist so I'll
let you know which one is the best side
and then I have one more pair of jeans
these are a lot cooler than what I would
normally go for they are straight leg
with a ripped em down at the bottom I
have just pulled myself a pair of Chloe
Susannah boots I don't know which color
I'm gonna keep yeah I got them in black
and brown suede so I mean I've been kind
of looking out for jeans that crop a
little bit higher so I can really show
off the boots which is what are these my
basketful they are kind of mom jeans
style which sometimes could look a
little bit unflattering so I'm going to
give these a go and hope that they suit
me I'm absolutely in love with these
jeans they're exactly what I've been
looking for so they come to just above
the ankle it shows a little bit of ankle
hopefully it won't get too cold
anytime soon so definitely a chilly
angle and when I have stabbed them with
my Gucci loafers which you guys have
seen well uh recently because I'm
obsessed with them but yeah II love this
I have a blog a friend called Anna Lee
who is basket birth to a baby boy that
she always looked so cool when she wears
jeans backers she's been wearing them
for years and I've always thought it's
so stylish but now I'm going to try
doing the trend go I like that they're
quite fitted around my thigh area but
then they go straight down I just see me
look so stylish and a really nice kind
of very cool way wearing jeans but
without them being super sis casuals
they're very stylish fashionable way of
wearing jeans this is another plain knit
piece I had a jumper like this from
Reese a couple years ago that I was so
so so much I recently decided I had
square root of x is getting a little bit
too bauble to my liking so this is a
much more affordable version from
insoles
again it's kind of jumpy you know the
always so much just fun there's really
crisp or tunnel warnings it's just so
cozy you can definitely fit yourself
underneath it cut this haul is literally
from bikinis and beach wear to autumn
and winter clothing very versatile but
you have this very simple classic knit
Farrell style looks super cozy feels
really soft and I'm sure I'll wear this
as those in the coming colder months so
this is quite literally the perfect
autumnal knit I cannot even explain to
you guys how soft it is it's just so
cozy I feel like I want to be all
wrapped up in blankets just in front of
the fire watching Harry Potter or
something is exactly what I was looking
for the material itself just has this
really lovely ferrule kind of like knit
to design on it really big billowy
sleeves that are just super super cozy
and yeah you could definitely wear your
thermals underneath this it's got such a
high neckline it's just everything that
you want in a cozy autumn jumper so
definitely keeping this one and last but
not least and if you guys are still here
you deserve a massive round of applause
if you got this from the video leave the
word denim somehow in your comments they
can be done emoji or just include the
word dance I know who my
most avid video watches are that this is
a pair of jeans from boohoo they are the
final piece in my ginormous in schools
they look pretty now at the top so
fingers crossed I'm actually going to be
able to get these over my hips and then
they have this very unusual kind of
scruffy ruffle design down at the bottom
it's almost like they've taken three
tiers of denim and really scrapped it up
but I think that unusual cuffs are going
to be coming into fashion a lot more
this autumn so I picked up this pair
fronds into vehicles as they were super
affordable so let's see if I can
actually fit them and that's my final
piece to try the jeans actually fit
surprisingly well they have a super-high
in a 50 content so they're really really
easy to slip on and they feel almost
like jeggings not sure if you can see if
I've picked up a couple of shoes here to
show you how I style them first of all
I've got these slightly higher heels and
Ritu's I've been wearing these loads
recently from the stairs and I went down
75 pounds I don't think there's too many
signs sizes left but yeah this is quite
unusual but I think I quite liked it as
I said it's going to come in style this
like ruffle to ruffle detail on jeans
and they are so comfortable
you could also style them with something
a little bit more casual these are my
Gucci and leopard print mules even more
stylish and quite fashionable chic but
yes let me know you guys think about
these I think I am 50/50 a super comfy
but will I wear them beyond this autumn
that is what I did not know that
everything that I picked up in my to a
thorn as recently I hope you guys
