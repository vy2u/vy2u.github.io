joining me for today's video it's going
to be what I think is my first haul of
2018 I think but don't quote me on that
it just feels like forever since I've
done one and I'm starting off with an
ASIS haul this is going to be a pre
spring a hustle now it's actually been
quite a while since I bought a load of
stuff from ASOS I don't know I've just
found that it got a little bit cool it
got a little bit East London Street
style and not really my style but now
that we're getting into spring which is
very much my style there are some pieces
that I could not resist adding it to my
basket
so this arrived this morning I actually
tracked it on the DPD app and it was
amazing I could literally see that he'd
stopped for a coaster before coming and
dropping us off very very clever so
great service um not sponsored by DVD so
I'm gonna just get started and show you
what is in my ginormous Asus box mmm but
first I'm gonna pose for the thumbnail
alrighty so the first thing is this pink
jumper and this is a Jack Wills jumper
to be honest the thing that I love the
most about a sauce is that they have all
different retailers from Jack Wills even
boohoo misguided up to Baker Reese that
kind of thing and you never really are
too short of all these different
retailers returns policies or they're
shipping a sauce you just know it's
going to be there the next day and no
problem with returns so I tend to do a
lot of my multi retailer buying all from
a sauce Jack Wills
I feel like I wore it a lot in my
teenage years I was I was that girl in
school that did like the raw hair style
like big quiff denim skirt ugh boots
Jack Wills hoodie that was me we used to
call them Sloan's or Raw girls let me
know in the comments below if you have a
clue what I'm talking about
it's probably a Monmouth girl school
thing but then it went then I went for a
few years generally shopping Jack Wills
and now I actually think they have some
beautiful pieces again so this is a
gorgeously soft jumper baby pink the
kind of thing that I know I'll get so
much use out of
I live in knitwear this time of year
spring chilly mornings when you just
want something cozy but that's not too
thick and bulky like it's going to a
point where this is actually too thick
and I really like the detail on this so
you've got these almost like woven bits
down there which adds a detail to the
neckline and then a nice high neck and
the sleeves are just quite plain with
the stretchy cuff detail beautiful color
let's see how this looks on this jumper
is absolutely perfect I love the color
it is so soft it feels absolutely
gorgeous on my skin really really like
the neckline how it's got this stripe
detail and then the fairly high ribbed
material up here I think the color is
just absolutely gorgeous I'm wearing it
slightly weirdly with a suede skirt for
something else that I was trying on but
I think this with pale colored jeans
could be a really nice way of just
making a jeans and a jumper outfit a
little bit more cozy and chic at the
same time so I just quickly also tucked
it in to my suede skirt and I think this
is a really nice way of once again
adding a bit of warmth to an outfit but
still being really really fashionable
and on trend for spring I think this is
definitely a way that I would wear it
out and about to a day of meetings this
suede skirt is very high waisted I
probably wear it with one that's not
quite so high up so that you get a
little bit more detail at the jumper on
show but I think this is really lovely
way of wearing it with high-waisted
trousers as well for even if you just
want a super cozy layering piece big big
fan of the jumper this next thing is
quite random a bit of a wild card it's
basically a blanket from a brand called
pinky and I actually thought that they'd
listed this at the wrong price because
this was only 21 pounds and I feel like
pinky is a pretty good designer to be
getting something that cheap it's this
ginormous blanket with pom-pom details I
thought this would look absolutely
adorable chucked over the sofa because
it's so thick it's like a really
substantial material I have to say this
it's pretty heavy
it's very heavy blanket I was gonna say
great for picnics but actually it's
probably too heavy for that but I really
love the pom-poms I'm gonna see if the
boys show any interest in these because
I feel like they could be the sort of
thing it could be the sort of thing that
little puppy dogs want to chew but
hopefully this will be a really chic way
of just covering our sofa this next
piece is a sauce own brand and I always
find that a sauce and brand can be a
little bit hit and miss so I'm always
really interested to see how the quality
is this looks like pretty good quality
to be honest it is a spring dress
it's got a sheer overlay if you spotted
my eight spring trends you can wear now
a video you'll have seen me talking
about how sheer fabric is a really big
trend and this just reminds me of the
perfect kind of Easter christening dress
if you've got any lovely events to go to
any garden parties any engagement
parties this is just absolutely adorable
it's fairly Buffon so I think it's going
to be quite voluminous on the skirts and
then you've got this princess neckline
detail at the front here adjustable
straps which is always a big bonus you
can make these longer or shorter just
kind of like bra strap styles so I'm
really excited to give this a try oh my
goodness I absolutely adore this dress
exactly what I was after when it comes
to just a really really cute dress to
wear to spring occasions I even think
this would be perfect as bridesmaid
dress or a prom dress it is absolutely
gorgeous so good that these straps are
adjustable as well I've had to hike mine
up quite a bit I'm not wearing a bra
underneath I think it would just be on
show a little bits it is quite low-cut
but then you can get wonder bras that go
down that low if you do need a bra this
is like the perfect thing it's a shoot
for a spring lookbook so you guys
definitely gonna be seeing this a lot in
the upcoming fashion content so be
warned this next piece is a brand that I
had not spotted on ASOS before but now
that I've seen it I'm seeing a lot of it
if that makes sense it's a brand called
hope and Ivy and I picked up this dress
I actually thought it was a jumpsuit but
it's a dress holds a neck you've got
this interesting crochet detail at the
back here this would be really lovely
for summer holidays I don't have any
holidays booked at the moment Charlie
and I are trying to plan at some nice
warm trips but again even in the UK when
the temperatures start to rise if you've
got a leather jacket you could pair over
the top of this or a suede jacket that
would be absolutely beautiful I'm gonna
give it a try it's going to have to be
pretty special for me to keep it because
it is quite far in the future that I
would be wearing this type of thing I am
really really torn with this there's so
much that I love about it but also some
bits that I think are a little bit
strange I think if you were having an
outdoor wedding then dressing your
bridesmaids in this would be adorable I
think the back is absolutely beautiful
with that crochet going across the back
or if you're going to summer garden
parties spring garden parties this is
beautiful
it's quite clingy to the body so if you
indulge a little bit too much of the
barbecue then you could definitely see
your tummy in this but then it's a
little bit of a strange fit around the
underarms and the neckline obviously a
halter neck so you can make it the
height that you want it to be because
that is a boat hi there I don't know I
think for summer holidays this could be
really really lovely but it's definitely
not the highest of quality it's not bad
quality at all but the material there's
just something not quite right about it
I'm not too sure I think if I had a
holiday coming up then I were to keep
this to wear but because I don't have
anything in the pipeline I think I might
send it back but I do think it's
beautiful I don't know I think it'll fit
differently on different body types but
for me there's something not quite right
here next I've got another piece from
Jack Wills and this is their cotton I
think they called it an overcoat and I
just thought that this was a really
wearable piece but also quite different
to anything I've got in my wardrobe at
the moment I've got trench coats of this
kind of material but sometimes you just
want something a little bit more casual
a trench coat you really do have to do
up for it to look good
roses I thought you could just pop on
over your shoulders and it's a really
lovely way of adding a pastel color to
your outerwear as I said in my spring
trends video it's really nice to have a
brighter colored outerwear because
everyone wears gray and black and I just
think that you have such a spring in
your step when you do wear brighter
color this I would say is a very
wearable pink but still a really
statement pink shade I think this is
probably gonna need steaming it looks a
little bit creased at the moment but I'm
going to try this on maybe just with a
jeans and t-shirt combination to see how
it looks so the coat actually has a
lining which is like a t-shirt lining
which is really unusual but makes it
very very comfortable the color I
absolutely adore I think it's such a
cute color still feels quite British in
that it's almost like a raincoat
materialist I don't know how to describe
it as definitely coat it so I feel like
raindrops just kind of bounce off this
but yeah I think it's adorable this
color I absolutely adore I think those
April showers days this is going to be
the kind of thing that I reached for
very very regularly it's very me just a
really fun way of
really nice colors your outerwear so
yeah big fan of this let me know what
you guys think in the comments section
down below so this is again a bit of a
wild card from ugh
I was more intrigued than anything else
to see how they would look and actually
I think that is quite fun so these are
ugh sliders and they have got almost
like this multi pom-pom fur and string
and knitted kind of detail on the front
I just think they are so much fun they
almost look like Birkenstocks in the in
the soul where they've got the cork and
then your foot really does lie in this
dip but there could be really nice ones
for wearing around the house for any
upcoming beach holidays again not that
I've got any planned and but yeah I
thought it would be great fun and I
think that uggs have a reputation that
they don't deserve I actually think of
shoes can be really stylish so yeah I
thought these are fun and I'm excited to
see how I can style these ones up up
next is another accessory and I got
these kind of matrix style sunglasses
you've probably already seen a lot of
vloggers and celebs wearing them they're
very much on trend at the moment and
I've not tried any before these were
very affordable I think that a sauce own
brand and they are bronze so I thought
if I'm gonna be able to wear any it's
gonna be this kind of color so I'm
intrigued to see oh my goodness I feel
like a character out of an 80s movie
they feel quite wide for my face shape
oh I feel like I look like someone out
of the Jetsons or is it Penelope pink in
Wacky Races I don't know but these are
quite unusual not sure how I feel about
these please let me know down in the
comments what you think of this sunglass
trend I know that there is a designer
that has some white ones I think the
specs have got a pear butts yeah I
thought I would give that trend to try
so let me know your thoughts on this
style of skinny sunglasses next is a
piece from fashion Union and this is a
high-neck top which is pretty much
purely lace so I'm not too sure what I'd
wear underneath this if I have that do
your bra with do your on the straps and
I would definitely wear that underneath
it but maybe I need to find a high
street alternative but it's essentially
a non-polar neck just a high neck blouse
we
long sleeves this could be to know what
this would be an amazing layering piece
if you've got a pinafore dress or if
you've got a jumpsuit or something like
that like a dungarees start outfit this
would be amazing for layering underneath
in fact I'll probably keep it purely for
that reason I'll see if I got any
dresses in my wardrobe that this can be
styled with or find something that will
make it not so sure underneath so this
blouse is actually not as see-through as
I thought it was going to be I think
because the lace is quite close it's
quite a busy lace that you really can
get away without putting a specific kind
of crop top on underneath I'm just
wearing a nude colored bra and you can't
see it at all which is amazing so that's
great because you can see the top a
little bit more it's so pretty bit of
shame to hide this such an affordable
piece but really really statement I
think it looks gorgeous with this
high-waisted skirt I've been wearing
this skirt so much it's so so versatile
it is a premium piece quite expensive
but I will leave it link down below
because it's one that I wear so much as
you guys probably know but yeah really
big fan off the top you could probably
pair it with a juillet as well for a
little bit of extra warmth because
obviously with the lace being so holy
it's gonna be a little bit chilly so
with a juillet I think that is
absolutely adorable bring you in a
little bit closer so you can see the
detail of the lace and look you really
cannot see my underwear which is great
so yes really big fan of the fashion
union lace top
another very random thing this is a
storage bag I thought that this was
really really handy it says hoarder
slash collector and the reason why I got
this was because we're reaching that
time of you and I'm going to be starting
to put some of my winter things up in
the loft for storage and I thought that
this because it's a really big bag with
a zip top I thought this would be very
very useful for storing my winter items
such as hats and gloves really thick
winter coats and thermals hopefully
we're reaching that time of you and
we're not going to need them until
hopefully October so yeah that's gonna
be really really handy for storing some
of my winter Garman
this next piece is a dress from true
decadence I'm not sure how much you're
going to be able to see but it's
essentially a whole tunic and then you
have got these tiny little sleeves like
3/4 sleeves it'll be cold shorter effect
and definitely gonna have to try this on
to show you but once again I'll probably
keep either this all the first dress
with the umber showers on it just for
spring upcoming events so let me know in
the comments which one you prefer and
which one I should keep this I feel is
very very me I adore this shade of pink
it feels very boho ish with these very
floppy cold shoulder sleeves love the
halter neck neckline it's not something
that I wear that often but it's just it
just hangs absolutely beautifully the
length as well I'm going to tilt the
camera down so you can see how long it
is so it's a very flattering length just
above the ankles if you pop some heels
on then it's still going to be very very
ladylike modest length but it's just
detail around the shoulders and around
the neckline I think is adorable if
you're going on a summer holiday or
again for any any summer occasion
whether that's horse races or engagement
party just absolutely beautiful
big big fan and I think I'm gonna have
to keep both of these dresses because I
love them both so much now I really
really love midi skirts and maxi skirts
and I thought that this was a really
really lovely style it looks quite big
I've actually got the UK four here but
it still looks i'll not big but i would
have expected it to be a little bit
smaller so i do want this to be really
really high-waisted once again this is
going to need steaming or ironing
because it has got quite creased because
it is cotton but really love the effect
of these buttons it could make for a
really lovely almost riviera style
outfit with perhaps a pale pink or white
t-shirt or you could wear this with even
wear this is like an off the shoulder
top that kind of thing i'll give this a
try let me know what you think and I've
just realised it does have a pockets as
well just always very nice so I really
was not too sure what to pair with the
skirt in the end I've gone for this
sleeveless again this needs ironing
steaming as well and sleeveless top
which I got from Rhys a couple of
Springs ago the skirt I do wish it was a
little bit narrower around the waist
like I said I wish it was kind of there
whereas it does hang
I'm a little bit of room but then having
said that the zip was quite tight so I
was struggling a little bit to get it on
it so they did make it a bit narrower
than it would need to have a long as it
I love the pockets I'm going to show you
what it looks like a little bit lower
down okay so this is how the skirt looks
from the bottom I really like the shape
of the hemline it's almost like an
asymmetric hem I do think it's a really
beautiful skirt I wish it was a little
bit more crease proof but then if you're
going I think if you're going on a
holiday on a boat if you're going on a
cruise or if you live in a coastal
resort I think it's very kind of seaside
ask the buttons remind me of almost like
a sailor style I do love it I'm just not
sure how much I would wear a piece like
this so I think I probably will end up
sending it back but I definitely
appreciate the style of it and I wish I
had more occasions where I could wear
something like this I have a few smaller
accessories down in the bottom the first
of which is this little whistles
card holder in this beautiful blush pink
I'll show you a close-up of it here
beautiful blush pink it's like a faux
alligator effect leather and then it's
got one pocket there big pocket in the
middle and then a pocket at the back my
card wallet which you may have seen in
my what's in my handbag video recently
it's getting a little bit battered so I
thought I would treat myself to a new
one to keep all of my different cards in
that I carry with me on an everyday
basis
this one was 25 pounds and I will use it
loads and loads so yes very happy with
that wonderful whistles then I have this
pair of sunglasses these are new look
sunglasses but of course got them from
ASOS they reminded me so much of my Kate
Spade ones and I actually got these more
for your benefit because I know a lot of
you really loved my round Kate Spade
sunglasses very 60s very retro but they
are fairly high price points so I
thought I would get these if you really
like that look but don't want to pay
there we go the Kate's a price tag these
I mean these are pretty much identical
they have got more of a hexagon shape
just inside the eye area but other than
that they are so similar I might keep
these just as like a backup because if
I'm going swimming or if I'm going out
for the day and I just want to chuck
some sunglass in my bag I don't want
risk scratching my Kate Spade ones dress
still want look these are absolutely
gorgeous really really good you before
the Kate Spade ones so yeah amazing fine
from you look for a sauce and then my
last small item is this pair of earrings
these are ASOS own brands so again
really affordable but I really love the
shape of these they almost look like
pac-man little gold pac-man's I'm going
to take a bow it out of your ear I'm
really liking switching up my earrings a
little bit more lately although I am
wearing my Monica burner to diamond ones
as my daily earrings but yeah thought
they'd be really nice way of switching
it up for certain special occasions and
last but not least this is a piece which
I feel is a really lovely staple for a
spring wardrobe a lovely spring
investment piece and it is a silk blouse
in a beautiful blush pink shade this one
was 159 pounds it's from whistles so it
is going to have to be really special
for me to keep it because it is an
investment piece but I have been looking
for a silk blouse to add to my spring
wardrobe for quite a long time in
previous years I found some that have
just been far too expensive or if
they're from a lower price retailer the
quality has not been perfect this has
got some really lovely design details
such as this little tie effect on
sleeves so you're going to be able to
create to the lovely bonus sleeves I
think the color is beautiful it doesn't
look like it's going to be too sheer so
fingers crossed you're not going to be
able to see my underwear underneath but
let's give this a try and fingers
crossed it might be the one so I've got
to say despite the fact that this
clearly needs steaming or ironing I am a
big fan of the blouse so far really love
this detail on the cuffs it's like a
pleated detail that goes into a knot or
a bow known as here to help me tie my
bows so I'm just not a bit but I think
that's a really nice detail it is not
sheer I do have a nude colored bra Ron
but actually you cannot see any detail
of the brown underneath so that's a big
tick I think the color is really really
wearable I've paired it with a suede
high-waisted skirt you guys have
probably seen this many times before but
yeah I really really like this as I said
it does need ironing and it is going to
be one of those pieces that does
continually need ironing each time you
wear it but the quality of the material
feels really really beautiful the color
it's like a perfect powder pink yes I
feel very positively about this one and
I
it's a keeper just one more thing very
quickly before I do finish because this
is also from a sauce but not from this
particular haul it is a jumper dress you
might have spotted this in my what's new
in my wardrobe video this I actually was
very kindly sent by a sauce I went to a
dinner event with the ASOS team a couple
of weeks ago and they very kindly said
we could choose a piece from the website
and then they sent it to us so very very
generous and I chose this jumper dress
jumper dresses I think are one piece
that you can really transition from a
winter wardrobe to a spring wardrobe
Kawai with over knee boots again with
like a suede jacket over the top and
this one is just a very simple very very
wearable design it's almost Chevron
detail in the knit going down not too
dissimilar to the kind of style that
I've got on at the moment quite a
contemporary take on at the jumper dress
I'll show you what this one looks like
on them because it really is a very very
wearable piece that I'm excited to get
even more wear out of so that is
everything that I picked up from ASOS
recently everything that I've mentioned
in today's video will be linked down
below so if you fancy doing any shopping
or you want to do a little bit more
research into any of these pieces then
just check the description box down
below everything you need will be down

is your favorite piece any that you
