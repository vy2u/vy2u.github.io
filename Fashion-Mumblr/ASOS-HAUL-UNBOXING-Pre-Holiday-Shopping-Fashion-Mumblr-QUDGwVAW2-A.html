having a really super day today today I
thought I'd show you a few bits and
pieces which I've picked up in a
pre-holiday haul so as you may know
right now as you're watching this I'm in
South Africa
this video is pre filmed so when this
video goes live I'll be on a holiday
with Charlie so I did pick up quite a
few bits and pieces in the lead-up to
our holiday it's going to be a bit of a
mixture between Beach holiday and going
out for lovely dinners and doing
excursions in the daytime so I really
picked up quite a varied selection of
pieces from ASOS and I still load open
up my parcels with you today and the
postman that literally dropped off these
parcels maybe 25 minutes ago so I really
got on the board and started filming
this so I have one bag full of products
and also a box as well so I'm thinking
that maybe not everything fit into one
bag because actually I only made one
order so let's get started with what's
inside the box
so the first thing that I picked up was
this run acute boho top from Pullman
bear if I show you that side you'll be
able to see it a bit more clearly so
this is one of those lovely off the
shoulder tops you can see that it's got
these straps and which go over the
shoulders and then these bits here which
is where my arm goes through I'm afraid
I'm not doing a try on this time just
because 99% of these items and I'm
keeping are going to be in a lookbook
video which I'm filming in South Africa
so don't leave me comments a mine and
you try on and it's because I'm doing a
little bit video so stay tuned for that
but this one I picked this up mostly
because of these straps that do go over
the shoulder because as much as I love
off the shoulder tops I do find that
they literally slip down and these old
straps will provide the support meaning
that hopefully it won't slip down but
it's a really beautiful light material I
thought this was going to be really nice
on those days when it's very warm and I
just don't want to have too much
material clinging to my body so that's a
really nice summery top from purlins
bare via a sauce then I picked up the
pair of very lovely kind of
we're called floral trousers from race
and if you watch from my spring wardrobe
essentials you'll know that I'm a huge
fan of floral trousers and I just
thought that these were a really lovely
smart pair they look like they're going
to be nice and slim fitting Rhys trials
is when I get my correct size and
normally a really lovely fit they don't
go baggy after a few washes and I
thought this print was a really lovely
way of adding a bit of a tropical design
into my holiday wardrobe we're not going
to doing Safari but we're going to doing
a few things along those kind of lines
so I thought they'd be a really nice way
of covering up but without being too
casual if that makes sense you know
maybe in the evenings on the safari kind
of places it'll be really nice with a
white silk t-shirt so I look forward to
styling those up with my holiday
wardrobe okay sadly this is a case of it
looks a lot nicer on the site than I
think it does in reality but this is a
kind of pinstriped beach dress but the
shape of it just doesn't look like it's
going to do me any favors I mean it
should really be quite nice and fitted
but the material just I'm not entirely
sure that how it's cut is going to look
that good on my body but it does have a
really cute neckline it's almost kind of
sailor girl style with this pinstripe
material and the way that the collar
forms and it is almost off the shoulder
as well with these similar the kind of
shoulder details as on that first pull
and bear tops I showed you and I do
really like the black and white stripes
I think it's a really lovely design I'm
just not sure that this material is just
gonna look that good unfortunately so
I'm gonna give that one a try but not
got charity good feelings about it sorry
ASIS okay I purchased this next one
because I knew that I would want
something in my holiday wardrobe that
would literally just be an easy peasy
beach cover-up and that's exactly what
this is so it's the cream kind of caftan
with some Brown stripes in it hopefully
the cameras picking up the journal Brown
stripes and then it's got a rope
fastening for the waist so I imagine
this will look really cute over a bikini
if I just want to go inside and maybe
grab a drink or grab some lunch but I
don't want to put on full outfit and I
think this will be really cute I'm
really sorry I'm not doing it
it makes it really hard to picture the
items but you'll have to wait even see
my lookbook for that because I promise
you these things will all be featured in
there but this is a brand called
faithful and I think I'd heard them
before I'm not sure I definitely haven't
owned anything from this brand before
but they did have quite a lovely
selection of beach cover-up sand beach
dresses so I may have a couple more
pieces from the brand in this haul but
the Rope style I thought was very kind
of South African kind of Safari a little
bits you know a little bit tribal with
the rope quite rustic and yeah the
colors very neutral so they'll fit in
really easily with the rest of my
holiday cups your wardrobe next I have a
Sun dress from ASOS and this is a maxi
dress so goes all the way down to the
floor
and on the top section you've got this
beautiful blue almost kind of embroidery
print when it is embroidery that's kind
of stitching that's giving you that
lovely blue pattern there and then are
there any slits that's how look yes so
there's a slit here which I guess would
be quite high thigh and there's actually
two slits so you can see the front
section was completely comes away so
that's gonna be really nice when you
walk it's gonna show a little bit of leg
this is really good price as well I feel
like this was around the 22 pound mark
so a really good price and again there's
something just super duper easy for
flinging on over bikini and not having
to worry about the rest of your outfit
because this is the outfit and I think
this will look gorgeous with some heeled
sandals as well maybe my wedges I think
I will get a lot of use out of this one
from boohoo you guys know me too well
and you know that I would never be able
to do an ageless order without ordering
some key sunglasses so I did purchase
another pair and these ones are rose
tinted lenses with a kind of milky
almost bone colored frame with a
beautiful kind of cat eye shape which I
absolutely love I can't get this done
with thing off at the moment to show you
but I think these are really really
beautiful very kind of classic design
you guys know I love my Cleo Australia's
sunglasses on
the pink lenses I just think there's
such good quality and good value for
money these I think we're about twenty
four pounds I'll leave a link down below
but I can imagine getting a lot of use
out of this they're so neutral is so
pretty so me excuse me um and yeah I can
imagine these will go with pretty much
all of my holiday outfits so I will get
a lot of use out of these sunglasses
okay this next one I'm really excited
about so it's actually going to make one
of these myself basically I saw Rosie
Londoner wearing a hat that says wish
you were here on it and I think hers was
Tommy Hilfiger or a brand from Nessa
Porter but basically it was around the
300 pound mark so I thought I'm gonna
buy a straw hat and write a message on
it in sequence but then I saw this which
says I'm busy probably not my number one
choice of sayings I did also see another
one from the same designer as Rosie
London as one that said going offline
which I thought was quite cute but hey
ho this was around twelve pounds I think
and you know what I just think it's such
a cute trend I can just close my eyes to
the world flop down my Sun Hat and it's
just really cute in the fun that it's
got that expression on it so I thought
that'd be quite a nice piece I'm not
gonna lie I was thinking about my
Instagram when I bought this but I
thought it's a really fun addition to my
holiday wardrobe and I think I'll get a
lot of use out of this
I do love wearing hats on holiday and if
they're fun and quirky but still look
good then I love them even more so I'm
really pleased with this little purchase
and yeah look out for lots of Instagram
spam with my I'm busy hats coming up
soon and that was the last thing in the
box so now I'm going to move on to the
bag I think it's mostly dresses in here
but it feels like there's a shoe box
don't remember ordering any shoes so
let's have a look okay now that I've
seen the brand I do remember this pair
of shoes and wait till you see them they
are so cute so most definitely another
Instagram inspired purchase but these
are a pair of flip-flops from a brand
called glamorous and they have
pom pom threads which I'm going to be
wrapping up my legs when I wear them and
I know these seem crazy but I keep
seeing pom-poms all over my Instagram I
feel like they're going to be ever at
Coachella and everywhere a trend Rises
summer so I thought I'd pick up this
pair before too many other brands jump
on the bandwagon and I just thought
these would look so cute in photos when
I'm wearing white denim shorts or a
little white day jazz just such a fun
way to add an instant bit of excitement
to a normal beach outfit and I think
these a gamer around the tiny pound mark
really not that expensive at all I'm
just so fun I mean oh gosh
can't even hold them and just such a fun
way of adding some color into my
otherwise quite neutral holiday wardrobe
so I'm so glad I picked these up and I
can't wait to wear them next up is
another off the shoulder top and this
one is by Vera Moda I actually saw a
blogger friend tweeting a photo of this
and I was like yes that is such a
gorgeous gorgeous blouse I need to get
my hands on that it's got beautiful if
you can see the shape flute sleeve
detail which is just such a beautiful
very 60s very kind of hippie chic kind
of look and then you've got the
elasticated neckline so it hangs off the
shoulder really beautifully and then
some broderie anglaise lace kind of
detail down at the bottom here so very
focused very 60s very close dial and
yeah I think this will look really
really gorgeous in the evenings and also
for some beach days as well and we're
getting down to the last two pieces this
one is absolutely beautiful honestly I
think I'm gonna wear this so much it's
just a very gorgeous white jumper ASOS
own brand so it really wasn't too
expensive and I hope the lighting is
picking it up on the camera basically
it's a normal knit up here then you've
got a beautiful frill and then you have
a much more
holey kind of knit for the main part of
the jumper before it goes down to a
little bit of frill down at the bottom I
think I might even wear this jumper to
fly in because just adds the touch of
glamour but still some nice warmth for a
really nice flying comfortable outfit
and you guys know me I love anything as
a little bit of detail on it anything
really feminine and girly and this just
ticks all of those boxes so can't wait
to
this one just so cute and last but
absolutely not least I picked up a beach
dress and this one is a sauce own brand
so this one is a really lovely quite a
thick lacy material it's more crochet
than the lace actually I'd say cuz it
feels quite knitted and then you've got
this crisscross lace-up design at the
front and the straps cross over at the
back so it'd be a really nice open back
feature that also really like how this
is cinched in the waist so hopefully
it's going to be nice and flattering and
again just another super duper easy one
to stick over a bikini I think it might
be quite warm as well which probably not
what you want to hear when you're going
on a summer holiday but sometimes you do
still want to be warm you can just look
about the pool it might be little bit
chilly or as you go into the evening
sometimes the temperature drops
I know it's likely to do that in South
Africa so I think I'll probably be quite
grateful for the warmth of this dress
and that's it for clothing but don't go
anywhere because they also picked up a
few beauty pieces the first beauty piece
that I picked up was the Elemis tan
Accelerator body lotion and I have
actually tried this before a couple of
years ago and when I went on a holiday
I'll be trying this it was the most
Brown that I have ever been so I can't
say for sure if it was this but it's a
chance that I'm willing to take this
basically I think it has carrot oil in
it I'm not sure if it says nut oil sheer
butter amino acid it basically says that
there's an acid in here that's naturally
present in the body and used by the skin
cells to form melanin and melanin of
course is what tones Branden our skin
and gives us that lovely tanned color so
it's a very safe way of making us more
Brown so I'm really excited to start
using this I'm going to be using it
daily I've got like five days until I go
on holiday it does recommend you can
even start one on two weeks before but
I'll also apply this before sunbathing
so as soon as I get out of bed I'll put
this on go to breakfast and then put my
Sun cream on afterwards this is not an
SPF and so I will of course we're
putting my piss when Sun cream on
afterwards before I go in the sunshine
but this hopefully will give me a lovely
even tan then I couldn't
just picking up the new Naz Velvet Matte
skin tint tinted moisturizer foundation
basically it's a new launch from NASA so
I had to try it
I'd heard really good things on blog
reviews that I'd read and I also try to
swatch well I was in Lane Crawford in
Hong Kong and I picked up my color there
a sample of it which is growing land I'm
sure a Hong Kong it just said green land
maybe they translate it differently but
that's the shade that I've gone for and
it's a really really good match and I am
absolutely already in love with the
finish of this sometimes on holiday in
the evening you want a really gorgeous
matte base but one that doesn't
completely get rid of your holiday glow
and I feel like this will do exactly
that it's also SPF 30 so if I wanted to
I have to wear in the daytime maybe when
we're out and about doing a day
excursion and I do want to have a full
face of makeup because the coverage on
this is pretty good so I think a really
good one to take on hold it with me I
also picked up a couple of brow products
the first one being the NYX tame and
frame brow Pommard
and I thought this would probably be a
good deep for the Anastasia brow Wiz
Ralph Ahmad I'm not sure exactly the
official name of it and it also looks
like a really good color match for me I
picked up a one in blonde so I'm hoping
it that this will be a pretty close
color to my natural eyebrow color it
looks really good to me and because I
love my brow pencils I also got the
blink brow bar brow definer in cinnamon
spice I find that brow pencils are just
a little bit better at creating actual
hair like drawings on your eyebrows if
that makes sense
so this one's a nice tiny one again
really good for taking away with me
another mini travel sized beauty piece I
picked up with the NARS what are these
actually called pure matte lipstick I
tried this on in spacing K and fell in
love with it and decided to get it on
ASOS because buying so I picked this up
in the shade Tonkin which is a really
lovely quite rosy pink I actually did a
first impression of this on my snapchat
not too long ago so give this video a
thumbs up if you spotted that but it's a
really beautiful shade it's still a
brownie pink like my all my favorite
lipsticks but it's a little bit more
rosy a little bit
would sure I'd say in the lipsticks that
I have been going for recently so again
a really super one great size for taking
in my travel bag and last but absolutely
not least I picked up the japonesque
solid brush cleanser now normally I wash
my makeup brushes with soap whichever
soap is lying around which is probably
not the best for the condition of my
brushes and singers I've got some really
lovely new brushes recently I thought
I'd invest in a good brush clean up so
this is a little bit like shoe polish
it's basically a solid balm and you wet
your brushes you create a lather on here
I guess like men's shaving bar that kind
of thing I don't really know I'm gonna
use that but I thought a really super
idea and it had really good reviews as
well so another one that I'm really
excited to try and that is everything
that I picked up in my ASOS pre-holiday
order I hope you guys we enjoyed looking
through so many enjoyed the whole
unboxing experience let me know if you
spotted anything that you like to pick
up for your holidays and any favorite
pieces and as I said don't forget to
