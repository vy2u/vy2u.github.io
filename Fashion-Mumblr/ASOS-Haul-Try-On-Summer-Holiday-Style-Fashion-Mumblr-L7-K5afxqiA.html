relaxed
it's awesome Topshop haul video today or
potentially two videos because I have
bought so much stuff that I'm surrounded
by shopping bags quite literally I have
one - a sauce boxes which is very scary
I've never ordered so much that is
coming two boxes before and I also have
a Topshop bag and a further a sauce bag
so we have quite a lot to get to I say
it's going to be a very relaxed and
casual haul video because the lighting
as you can see is not perfect it was
pure blue skies a few minutes ago and
now it's grain really and myself boxes
are up in the lot so this is the
lighting we're going to have to deal
with um and also because I'm going to
film my trying on sections in a little
bit more in informal ways so hopefully
you guys like it if you are new to my
channel then you will see haul videos
quite frequently popping up here and I
did a us for recently for things I
bought while I was in America for a Kate
Spade Tory Burch etc and I frequently do
a sloth schools Topshop Bulls River
Island hauls and so yeah if you are new
then definitely hit the subscribe button
so that you don't miss any of my videos
I usually do around two a week fashion
beauty trouble that kind of thing let's
get started with a sauce and potentially
I will save Topshop for another video so
I'm going to start by opening one of the
boxes I'm going to put the other box on
the floor because I have got no room on
this bed okay box number one and this is
the lighter box of the two so hopefully
we can speed through those
these literally will deliver this
morning so this is Major first
impressions also I'm so impressed that
with a sauce premiere if you order on a
Sunday they will still be delivered on a
Monday so I ordered these yesterday
which was a Sunday at around 8 p.m. in
the evening and they still arrived at 10
o'clock this morning so a sauce you
amaze me okay a lot of this stuff is
actually for Charlie's so let's get rid
of those boring boys t-shirts
Charlie always orders men's t-shirts
from a sauce because I think around like
70 pounds and they fit in really well so
if you only guys are kind of like
muscley rugby player size that don't
want things you're too baggy a sauce
t-shirts are really good okay this is
stuff for me okay so it looks like this
box has been full of the smaller slash
accessory pieces for me there's a black
box which says a toss-up okay I remember
this is now I wasn't sure what it was
but this is a little warship from new
look so this I think was under 20 pounds
I picked it up with such a loot with
such a good bargain and very classic
design so I'll show you a close-up of
this now so as you can see it's a
beautiful brown leather strap with these
gold clasps which attach onto the face
which is quite an unusual design and
then you've got this beautiful rose gold
face very classic style and I really
love the slim strap as well doesn't
actually say how much it was on here it
really knows me how a those never put
the prices on but I think this is a
really beautiful very simple classic
design I thought for the price this was
really really good
so looking forward to wearing that one
I'll probably take this with me on
holiday tomorrow and I think I've got a
lot of use out of this it's just so
classic I also picked up a couple of
nukes lipsticks I never know if that
way to say is it not so NYX or next I
don't know but basically I went to a
scotch a couple of weeks ago and a girl
another blogger there boy Lydia she was
also wearing or she was wearing the most
beautiful lipstick my asked to what it
was and it was this so Thank You Lydia
if your recommendation I have picked up
this from ASOS I think it was around
like 599 so not too expensive at all and
it's a soft matte lip cream and it's a
beautiful matte color but the quality
Lydia they're really really comfortable
to wear so I'm really looking forward to
giving this a try I've got the shade
Cannes and I will insert a swatch here
so you can see the color of this really
really really looking forward to wearing
this because I've heard really good
things about the next lip colors and
then we have a beach bag just going to
really ruin the lighting of this video
but it's a very simple classic straw
beach bag with these tassel details on
the kind of of the leather pocket over
the front so I thought it made it very
kind of 70s boho almost a little bit
Chloe ish and and it just looks a lot
more expensive and designer than it
actually was I really like the fact that
it has this closure because it just
makes it a little bit more secure I can
tell these tassels are really going to
annoy me though and and oh I've just
seen it's by the brand pinky so it's not
actually an ASOS own brand one and it's
got a little pocket here for your phone
and also a zip pocket inside which would
be good from the mobile or keys or
anything that you don't want to be in
this main sections it's absolutely huge
so plenty room for my towel my book my
camera all that kind of stuff which you
take with you on the beach on holiday
and I'll probably also use this for my
hand luggage
yeah these tassels are definitely going
to get annoying and I'm going to be
really OCD about them being neat and
straight but I think it's worth it is
such a beautiful design and then we have
a couple more accessory is one of which
is this beautiful choker necklace which
I thought looked very Chanel it's gold
flowers with little pearl
middle and I didn't really like those
ribbon style chokers that seemed to me
everywhere and but I thought this one
was a lot more elegant and we're just
really really beautiful with a white
place suit so I'll give this a try with
a few of the outfits don't take my
holiday with me I think it will look
really really delicate and very elegant
as well and hopefully look more
expensive than it was because this was
aces own brand so really not too
expensive at all which is wonderful
and then the last thing from that first
box is this little gold starfish makeup
bag which I did not need but I just
thought you have to have a specific
holiday makeup bag and this one is a
really good size plus is rose gold it
has starfish is on it so really really
perfect for holidays it's kind of like a
weird crackle material I don't know if
you can hear it but the the starfish are
almost 3d which could get a little bit
annoying but we all stick with it I
don't actually know why I've gone so
crazy for holiday shopping because my
two main holidays have already happened
I've only got one left which is sending
for three days and that's tomorrow so
maybe I need to book a few more holidays
where the rest of this stuff right where
should we start
so first thing that I can see is this
towel now this is actually a new look
brand towel by picked it up from ASOS
and I think this was around 12 pounds
and palm print is just so in fashion at
the moment that's all in my Instagram
and yeah for 12 pounds I thought this
was really really fab so it's a great
size towel you've got these multicolored
palm prints all over it it's really nice
and soft and then you've got the
textured side on the other side there's
not really that much more I can say
about it it's just a really nice towel
really good price and a really lovely
pattern so I'll definitely be taking
that one with me
to make a NOS tomorrow then we have a
blue jersey dress and in my head I
thought this is going to look really
beautiful and elegant and just fit
really really nicely but what I'm going
to do is know try this on with my
vlogging camera and let you know how it
fits so here we have the first dress the
blue one and I have to say I love how
this fits it's a really beautiful
material which is just really
body-hugging you can see it just fits me
really really beautifully it would be
nice if I had a bit of cleavage but we
all know that that does not exist and I
think this color is really flattering
you've got a little pocket here and
another pocket there it's not going to
be very forgiving if you eat anything I
don't know what that lump is I think
it's put on my stomach um but yeah I
think it's really lovely but I'm just
not sure when I would wear it it's a
very elegant length it's quite
mother-of-the-bride II um yeah I just
don't know when I'd wear it that's the
only issue but it fits so beautifully
and I think it's so elegant Oh as a tie
at the back which I didn't actually
notice so maybe you could tied at the
front let's have a look I've tried
really hard to do a beautiful bow but
this material is just not doing it very
nicely and I feel like that really ruins
the shape that kind of cuts you in half
as opposed to this which is fairly
elegant so I wonder if you could tie it
at the back but it's one of these that
the material really wants you to bring
it round maybe if I double around let's
see so that's better maybe this is how
it's supposed to be but let me know in
the comments if you've any people I
might one of those or people to keep it
it feels so tangible a little to love it
just well next is another item of
clothing and this is actually the piece
that made me
to make this a sauce order so it's a
little place suit from misguided and
I've been buying a lot of misguided from
a sauce recently just because the prices
are so good and I find myself wearing
them an awful lot during on holiday once
again I'm going to try this on with my
vlogging camera so you can hear my first
impressions on a fit etc I so wanted
love this place OOP but something about
it is just not quite right so this is
the misguided one and I mean it's not
bad at all it's just something not quite
as nice about it as other place suits
that I've got from misguided so because
I've got a couple of really similar
things I don't think I'm going to keep
this one and but if you don't have
similar things then I think it's still
gorgeous
I really like the the eyelash detail on
the little short I think that is
gorgeous
I do quite like this top area but your
brow is visible through here which is
not ideal and it kind of reminds me of
triangle bikini tops but I do also
really like the t-shirt sleeve style
here's a unfurl length so yeah it is
lovely but because I've got two very
similar I think I'm going to send this
one back but let me know you guys think
it is very cute I don't know maybe I'll
keep it let me know now I have got a
couple of pairs of sunglasses this I
thought was going to be a really
expensive pair because they're in a
really kind of fancy pouch for actually
them aside which means they're around
ten or twelve pounds I will leave all
the links below to everything so if you
like anything you want to check the
prices clearly I'm quite useless so
remembering them I'll leave all the
links as always in the description box
below so here's my first pet from
misguided they're quite an unusual shape
and not quite round and not hexagonal um
but I thought they were again very 70s
boho ish so I thought these are really
lovely need to take these off of those
in my book yeah I thought these are
really really good for the price and I
just love having new pairs of sunglasses
when I go on holiday because they really
finish an outfit
make it look much more glamorous in my
opinion and I'm really impressed by this
little pouch they come in like a pink
velvet pouch which I love then we have
another pair of sunglasses and these I
believe are a source own brands of these
I think we're around 30 pounds but again
links will be down below and I really
like the design on these if I remember
correctly yes oh they're a very pale at
tor toys shell and tortoiseshell
sunglasses are my absolute favorite and
I really like the paler style of these
I think they suit blonds a lot more a
little bit softer on the face if that
makes sense get rid of those ones again
so yeah I think these they're actually
quite big on my face but I do love big
sunglasses so let me know what you guys
think of these ones okay this one I'm
really really excited about and this was
another thing that it was very expensive
so I did um know about this quite a lot
see how to let me know your honest
opinion on this one
and it is a beautiful handbag by Ted
Baker so I haven't actually bought
anything from Ted Baker in quite a long
time but I don't really have oh that's
such a lie I was going to so don't
really have a summary handbag but then I
have my Valentino's so maybe this is a
little bit excessive but I thought this
design was so stunning it's a pale pink
you've got the Ted Baker rose gold bow
here and then almost like an
hand-painted design as these beautiful
flowers hopefully you can see it with
the lighting but it's really really
stunning and then this is very sturdy
handle on the top there
you've got rose gold details like you
always get with Ted Baker
so there's rose gold links here to
connect the handle you've got a leather
kind of magnetic clasp here which keeps
the bag more secure and then in the
middle you've got this little oh and
what if you can remove this I'll be so
cute if you can yes I think you can
there's amazing so actually this is too
backed in one because the middle section
is this very slim envelope clutch the
rose gold zip so I could keep my
passport or my purse and oh my gosh it's
even got this is what I love that Ted
Baker they always have all the details
really really beautifully done which
kind of justifies the high price point
so within the clutch alone you've got a
beautiful rose gold detail
and inside it's got the same floral hit
myself in the face it's got the same
floral design as the outside of this bag
which hopefully you can see but it's
really really starting so you could use
the bag without this middle section but
you just pop it into there and I think
yeah so it doesn't have anymore zippy
compartments but it does have a shoulder
strap as well so overall a very very
beautiful handbag I think because of the
price I think this is around 130 pounds
I'm going to have to make sure I'm going
to get a lot of use out of this too
otherwise it is very expensive but for
the detail of this bag I think it is
weaponed the next couple of pieces in
the box are shoes I can't actually
remember what shoes I've ordered so this
is going to be a bit of a surprise okay
so these are some really beautiful
espadrille style shoes and they've got
this gorgeous floral detail on the toe
which i think is absolutely beautiful
but these look way too big so I wear a
size 36 but Nagus you know just say
three on the top there maybe as the
point makes them look bigger but I
thought these would be so gorgeous from
Mickey Mouse because there's cobbled
streets you don't want to be wearing any
heels and it's all about the flat shoes
so I thought these are looks so stunning
so I need to try these are the few of my
outfits but this detail is just so so
beautiful and if I'm not wrong these
were around 12 pounds so an absolute
bargain but once again don't take my
word for it have a little look down
below if you like them because knowing
me they probably went on to our pound
store but something in my head tells me
that they are a really really good price
we have another lips lipstick just
floating around the bottom of this bag
that could be very easy to miss so I
think we need to package their beauty
products a little bit better if they're
going to stick them in the boxes but
this one is called San Juan so I thought
it would be a really beautiful coral for
wearing on the beach and I just in coral
looks so stunning when you have a tan so
but I pick that one up as well because
there's such a good price and finally in
that box is another
pair of shoes this time a pair of wedges
and this pair have a blue and white kind
of marbled print design on the strap and
on the ankle strap and I picked up a
pair of wedges because I just think
they're so lovely to are on holiday
they're very leg-lengthening but as I
mentioned is probably most places in
Greece so wedges are pretty much it only
heels you can get away with so I'm going
to try these on hopefully they're
comfortable and if they are then they'll
definitely be coming with me and finally
we're moving on to the bag which I feel
of it is only clothing I don't need it
anymore
shoes are accessories so let me tip that
out have not got a clue what this is
pink right um I think this might be a
pink dress let's have another look oh
yes I remember this now so this is a
beautiful dress it's a sauce own brand
and it's got these cutout details on the
side which I'm not going to be very
clear unless I try this on it so once
again let me try it on for you and I'll
let you know what I think okay not quite
what I was expecting
beautiful but not what I was expecting
this would need a little bit of
tailoring it needs pinching in at the
waist there it's got this ginormous tag
saying you cannot return it once you've
worn it obviously I really like these
cutouts so there's like the back angle
but this is definitely like a
bridesmaid's dress this is not the kind
of dress you could wear to I don't know
not many occasions you could wear this
maybe a prom dress is stunning I really
like the cutout something that's really
flattering but I mean yeah it's
definitely a prom dress or a
bridesmaid's dress and I'm not going to
be a bridesmaid or going to a prom
anytime soon so sadly this is going to
have to go back but if you have got a
problem coming up or you are going to be
a bridesmaid then this is stunning
and I think it could be tailored very
easily to fit you perfectly so I would
need my shoulders taking up maybe an
inch or not quite an inch and I would
need the waist pinning in just the
tiniest bit so it fits snugly and then
it would be so stunning I wish I had an
occasion to wear this because it really
is beautiful need some heels on but
sadly I don't so it's going to have to
go back this next one is really good
I'd say on this video but I will show
you quickly anyway it's a t-shirt from
Oasis and I really love that ASOS stocks
Oasis it's not a brand whose website I
normally visit but a lot of the things I
love so it's really nice to see them in
the ASOS and you in section and so this
is the plain white t-shirt with Blut
beautiful fluted sleeves says on the
back it was 35 pounds so not a bad price
for the kind of thing I'm sure I'll get
a lot of use out of so once again let me
try it on and show you thought I was
going to love this t-shirt but sadly I'm
very underwhelmed the material just
seems like it's going to crease so badly
I know it's just come out of the box but
I still feel like it should not be this
creased and because of this sleeves just
don't fall right it's such a shame
because this and it's also too long like
it should be that but yeah it has
everything going for it it should be
gorgeous but sadly I'm disappointed is
another Oasis piece and how cute is this
pattern I absolutely adore these pink
candy stripes
I think these with white shorts for
example is going to look so they're so
cute you can't really see it too clearly
so I'm just going to show you me try it
on I love this top so the colors are
just absolutely stunning the pink and
the white stripes I love they're so me I
think it looks so nice with white jeans
with white shorts as well it would look
really beautiful love this ruffle detail
I think this is kind of thing I'll be
wearing so much over the summer
hopefully it warms up in the UK's that I
can wear it here otherwise I'll be
saving this for some nice summer
holidays it definitely needs an iron and
which is slightly annoying that it's
that kind of fabric but this is so
beautiful I might take the sleeves up an
inch just it can be a bit revealing with
the old underwear so yeah I think if I
take the sleeves up just a tiny bit this
is going to be absolutely perfect okay
this next one is really funny because
basically I saw it and I added it to my
basket with the full intention of
wearing it in a salsa style photo so
that I could be the red salsa lady emoji
and it
is this very flamenco ish oranjee red
dress so you've got this very typical
Spanish kind of roughly sleeve detail
you've got a v-neck and ruffles going
all the way down the middle but it feels
like an awful lot of fabric so I'm
intrigued to try this on I'm just not
sure when I would wear it so let me know
what you think when I try it on as to
whether I should keep it or not is it
worth it just for the Instagram photo to
say that I am the red emerging ad okay
this is hilarious it is so low-cut like
I have no idea what underwear you'd wear
with this I am really disappointed in
the low-cut nurse of this but if you are
willing to sew it together maybe you
have like an emoji party coming up in
which case you can be the Spanish lady
or if you've got a Spanish salsa party
or something I also feel like I look
like a prisoner like from Orange is the
new black or something because of the
color so sadly I am slightly
disappointed with this it does have some
nice slits so it can be quite sexy if
you've got a little salsa date to go to
and but yeah sadly not for me and last
but not least we have a bikini and not
just any bikini this is a marble bikini
so I have been absolutely loving
high-waisted bikinis recently I find
them so flattering if you've just had
lunch and your tummy is possibly not as
flat as it could be they just hide a
multitude of sins and I thought this one
was absolutely gorgeous so not only is
it high waisted but it also has these
straps which you can wrap around your
tummy up to your waist I guess so I
think this is going to look really
really cool on I'm not going to try this
because TMI but if I've taken any photos
of myself wearing it on holiday I insert
them here if you don't see in photos and
it means it doesn't look that good so I
probably lent it back but yeah so these
are the bottoms nice and high waisted
and then this top actually looks like a
trials top it looks so tiny I don't know
if that's going to cover very much but
it would be very good for tan lines so
yeah this is the matching top it looks
like quite a sporty style which usually
quite suits me so I'm looking forward to
giving out a try so that's everything
that I picked up from ASOS and in the
aim of not making this video super super
super long I'm going to film my Topshop
haul separately so check back in a few
days if you'd like to see what I picked
up from Topshop because there are so
many gorgeous pieces I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video and as always
leave me your comments in little section
below let me know what you like what you
think I should definitely keep what you
think I should send back and I hope you
don't mind the small casual style of
video as I said the Lighting's not great
and I'm trying new way filming with the
vlog style clips of me trying things on
so hopefully you found that quite useful
to see more of an in-depth review of
them that way anyway give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and
subscribe it from you and I'll see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
