joining me for another estas hole here
on my youtube channel today's haul is
going to be an autumnal much more
autumnal than the last one which
actually didn't end that would be too
autumnal don't I could get some that out
of my head this one is actually going to
be more autumnal at lots of classic
pieces to fill your autumn wardrobe with
and yeah I really feel like I picked up
some lovely bits as time so I'm excited
to open up these boxes and try them on
with you so I have two holes or two
separate shopping trips I'm going to be
having a look through today one I made
about a week ago but I still haven't
opened it I wanted to save it for this
video and then one that actually only
arrived yesterday so hopefully lots of
these pieces will still be in stock and
on a website as always all the links to
the bits that I buy and try on will be
down in the description box so if you
like the look of any of them and you can
just head down there and shop from them
basically also if you are new to my
channel then hello and welcome and I
would love it if you would subscribe I
do fashion beauty travel lifestyle all
that kind of jazz and I'm posting every
single day this month so if you don't
want to miss any of my videos then just
hit that little red button down there
and you won't miss anything from now on
so I'm gonna get straight into haul
because there are two so I don't want to
make this super long I'm gonna get
started with the box just because it's
right here in front of me so let's have
a look okay the first item is really
random and I bought this as a gift for
one of my friends and if she's watching
she's gonna know straight away that it's
her but yeah it's a talent a Tim 2017
calendar and obviously this is like a
Christmas gift they've got gifts in
already but as soon as I saw this I just
had to buy it so ah I'm really
disappointed there's no topless ones
they have missed a trick there if anyone
knows of any topless shining take some
calendars and let me know they always
put in some little goodies and they've
put me in a little fragrant sample of
angel by Mugler
like a travel item as well okay first
proper piece I'm guessing this is a pair
of shoes oh yes oh these are really nice
okay I had actually spotted these in and
I think karate magazine or something
like that but these boots are from mango
and I just instantly fell in love with
them this big circle buckle that makes
them look very designer I think it's
Chloe that has boots of this kind of ilk
this this kind of style and but also
there are just a black boots they have
got a really good heel size and I just
love black boots in winter when it gets
to that time of year which is pretty
much now when you can't get away with
wearing open-toed shoes
I love boots and I just sickness is
going to make mine black jeans or yeah I
think black jeans or clots would look
absolutely gorgeous with these on the
end and this detail just makes them look
so designer II I think they were around
89 pounds and only I don't have the
price on here but yeah I think I'll get
a lot of use out of these so really
please I pick them up and it says
authentic leather so they are leather
which is great personally I prefer to
invest in less shoes but higher quality
because if you get non leather then it
can cause all kind of problems for your
feet
not to mention lack of breathability so
a little bit smelly so yeah really
really pleased with these I'm going to
try them on and hopefully they're super
comfy because I want to wear them a lot
the next thing that I bought is also a
gift and actually for the same friend
because she always has really cold feet
so I picked up these slipper socks and
these are seriously scrumptious so they
are from lounge below boutique I think
these are like eight pounds not too
expensive and they've got the grippy
bits of plastic here soon and gooey bits
of plastic that's taught me sliding
around really super sock there that like
mega soft material little pom-poms at
the top I think these are just such a
lovely autumn winter essential weather a
treat to yourself or as a gift for a
friend they're just really really lovely
and snuggly so glad I picked those up
next is a balance and
we produce the belt for a while I think
I did actually buy one in a previous
haul but then I decided it was too
boring where is this one because I think
jeans with something tucked in and a
belt just looks really sleek and it's
very on trend at the moment and this one
has a snake on the buckle so you thread
the leather I don't know if it's real
leather I think is quite inexpensive
thread the leather through there and it
looks like this which i think is a
really I don't know it's unusual it's
looks more high-end than its price tag
it could be Gucci or I don't know why I
sell but it's not it's pesos own brand
so yeah I think this will look really
really cool with somewhat distressed
denim then I picked up a boo-boo top
I don't normally buy that much from a
boo-boo I'm normally left a bit
disappointed by the quality but I do
pick up the odd booboo bit from ASOS and
this is a pink satin it's hot
I just fell in love with the fabric to
be honest I thought it was so beautiful
and it's an off-the-shoulder but with
straps to hold it in place I think this
will be quite nice when it gets to that
time when we want to be wearing just
something a little bit smarter for
evenings out it gets that time of year
when there's lots of Christmas parties
and things like that I know I'm going
really ahead of myself but yeah often
it's nice to just wear a pair of
trousers and a really snazzy top so I'm
gonna give this a try and hopefully it
will be as lovely as I expected it to be
this next one is quite a classic
autumnal wardrobe piece and it is a pink
high neck jumper and I know I know for
sure that I will get tons of use out of
this it was just a sauce only brand in
the petite section I really like the
high neck it means I can fit a thumb
underneath it or even like another top
so nice and warm and to be honest it
doesn't really have any other design
details other than a bit of a V in the
neckline in the knit detail but I just
love the color I love the chunky knit
and this is the kind of thing that I'll
probably wear mostly at home to be
honest because it is quite casual but
I'm sure that I will find myself
reaching for this so so so often and
then the final thing in this box is
another pair of shoes and these are also
from mango mango is just absolutely
be killing it with their shoes at the
moment these when I manage to take this
bit off I thought this was part of the
design I don't remember that these are
just so so beautiful I'm praying these
are comfortable and my feet are often
kind of between sizes or actually too
small for a size three so I did get
these in a 36 I'm just praying to God
that they are gonna fit me because
they're gorgeous heel height this is a
kind of heel height that I can swear all
day and they are pretty much identical
to the Gucci one scoot shorts you have
the gold bit here but this entire color
and design is pretty much Gucci so I
really really hope these are gonna fit
because I think with culottes jeans
white jeans skirts dresses these are
going to be such a beautiful beautiful
addition it to my shoe collection that
was everything in the box and next I'm
gonna have a little look at what's
inside my massive carrier bag so this is
the one that arrived about a week ago
so I can't remember exactly what's
inside that's covered up oh yes okay so
this one I thought it sold out because
when I made an order the last time I
didn't a saw school this wasn't included
and I was a bit annoyed that they just
not told me that it wasn't in stock
obviously they've just weirdly added it
into my next order very strange but it
is a super bubbly and furry
dressing-gown I know I just got a new
one remarks and Spencer but I also want
to just a super snuggly one and this
one's a lot shorter as well so it's a
little bit more you know when you come
home from work you want to shop
something super comfortable on it has
got a hood with ears on which is not
terribly my style I probably won't wear
the hood up so you won't see the little
ears but if you are cute and you like
ears then all right ears on the hood and
yeah so it's just pretty much a classic
dressing-gown it's this faux sheep sheep
wool material and yeah I just think that
we super snuggly and I'll probably wear
this most days in autumn and winter next
is a jumper and this one is from
warehouse is actually quite plain
I picked it up mostly because of the
sleeves because they've got this fluted
edge and I just think that that detail
is so so beautiful I'm loving all the
dramatic sleeves and in trend at the
moment once again a really classic
design it's got a little bit of detail
up here at the neckline nice high polo
neck Jake without a polo neck no crew
neck and I think correct me if I'm wrong
but I think this is a crewneck eater who
revives my neck hangs a little bit more
and so once again can fit the thermal
underneath it which is great for keeping
nice and warm 39 pounds so not breaking
the bank not the cheapest for a plain
gray jumper but it does feel lovely and
soft I don't think it's got cash marina
I think it's probably just polyester
polyamide acrylic and wool so just have
a bit of wool in it so it will be nice
and warm but yeah feels really lovely
and soft and it could be quite a classic
autumnal wardrobe additional next is a
pair of shoes from Caravela and I don't
actually remember these but I have a
feeling we made it quite similar to the
mango ones and I bought it before so
I'll leave prices of both on the screen
now which maybe will help me make my
decision too which ones I keep oh I do
like these so these are obviously it's
silver whereas the mango ones were gold
I think I slightly prefer the gold but I
do prefer the buckle on these because
they do have the bit going over the top
which is more Gucci ish they are so so
similar obviously both designs are
pretty much identical but I have a
feeling that the mango ones are going to
be a tad cheaper so I think these may be
going back and also I do slightly prefer
the gold next is another top from boohoo
and this one is kind of a Victoriana
style it's not going to be very obvious
until I try it on but quality wise it
looks quite creased already which is not
a terribly good sign but you know me I'm
going to just try it on before I make a
judgement so yeah let's give it a try
now we get to the denim part of the hall
I have still been looking for my perfect
autumnal pale jeans
picks up a few pairs to compare few
pairs to compare in this hall these are
a slightly looser fit than what I would
normally go for I think they are the for
me style a little bit paler than what
I've got in my wardrobe at the moment as
well
got some ripped knee action going on and
normal hems so if I like these I will
end up cutting those hems to make them
raw so yeah these ones are twenty four
thirty they look quite small on the
waist so hopefully they're going to fit
I hope I can get them over my hips
that's normally the area where I
struggle so yeah I'm going to try on all
the jeans and you can let me know which
ones you think I should keep so the next
pair I prefer the wash on these the
color is a little bit more wearable than
the lighter ones before they've got this
unusual strap detail on side which I
guess doesn't really do anything but it
does look quite cool especially if
you've got like a utility blouse tucked
in that would be quite a nice design
detail really really high-waisted as you
can see by the length from crotch to hem
really high-waisted which I love and
they do have a step 10 which is where
the front part of the hem is higher up
the bone the back part you can see there
it stepped which is a design detail that
I really really like no rips on these
pockets which again is nice for this
time of year because you don't get a
cold knees so let's give these a try as
well and the final pair of jeans last of
the three these ones are the darkest and
I think they're the most boring to be
honest I don't really have any design
detail at all apart from these poppers
which is just very boring they're all
Aesop's own Brown which I don't think I
intended but that's what they are these
look at down like a wider fit very plain
hems just very very plain but hey hey
let's give them a strike so that's
everything I picked up in today's a
sauce haul I hope you guys enjoyed
looking through those bits with me as
always you know I love your opinion so
let me know which pieces you think I
should keep and which pieces you think I
should send back down in the comment

thoughts really really seriously so

previous hauls just to let you know I
have got two more holes and hopefully if

misguided haul because I once again have
