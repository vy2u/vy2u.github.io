keeping up with everyday may you might
have been expecting a vlog today but
actually things have got a little bit
hectic with all the renovations we have
since been putting the house back
together again and it's got the four
o'clock and the hand picked up the
camera yet so I thought instead of not
filming a video I would share with you
what I thought recently from ASOS and
River Island I mentioned it in
yesterday's video and I was just reading
through the comments and lots of you
wanted to know what I had bought so I
thought I would try to create a business
filming set up um I will show you what
the rest of the room looks like in a
little pan here but basically I've
created this little corner of
Tranquility to share with you my recent
shoppings I'm going to Monaco tomorrow
and a lot of these pieces were bought
with that in mind but also just a few
upcoming summer holidays I'm going to
jump straight in with the a soft fit
that I've already unboxed I haven't
opened them out from their plastic yet
and I've already taken them out of the
bag so first of all I was really
attracted to the lemon print I thought
it looked very dolce gabbana and this is
from a brand called Moon River and I
have bought a few Moon River pizzas
before and that's that you love them
this is a little play suit with the
Clemen print all over it and then you've
got this frill detail going down the
front the drawstring waist and then a
little ruffle detail on the bottom map
so I think this is going to look
absolutely adorable this one is a size
extra small by the looks of it I ordered
a couple of different sizes or maybe
I've accidentally ordered two at the
same thing that some of those okay so
it's actually two different designs this
is much more of a long dress it's got
this crossover detail middle so I don't
if it's going to be revealing or no
you've just got a bow detail over the
front of the material and then it goes
down into this really beautiful dress a
little bit longer good for the evening
for house so I'm going to give those
those a try I'm not going to keep both
of them so I want you guys to help me
out and let me know which one you think
I should keep because the pattern is
just actually gorgeous by definitely
work well both of them okay so first of
all I absolutely love the print
this one it's exactly what I was hoping
for there's almost like Club Tropicana
filled with the lemons and the thrills
and all the ruffles going on up here I
just think it's a beautiful I do wonder
however if maybe there are too many
ruffles this top section feels really
busy and there's also this kind of
pom-pom detail running along the edges I
think once is ironed it could be a
different story it's also pretty short
and then it kind of comes up a little
bit on the sides which makes it look
pretty revealing and I have sticky long
legs
so I can imagine if you do have long
legs this could look pretty raunchy or
roast but maybe that's me being a granny
but having said that I do really like it
I think I need to put them so into it
and also try the other dress to prepare
so let's try the other one and you guys
let me know which one I should keep so
here's the dress it is a much more me
length that makes you sound like such a
granny but being like around the knee
length it just makes me feel a little
bit more comfortable in it and I really
like the top detail so it's got this bow
detail across the booth area there's a
lot of fabric going on here not sure how
I feel about the amount of fabric but I
really like the effect it's a little bit
annoying that neither have got pockets I
just have become so used to like putting
my hands in pockets recently I think
that way the Tanners have done it really
gorgeous it's showing off a lot of skin
so really nice to also catch the Sun in
this it's almost like neither of them
have got the exact right length
personally in my favorite length is just
above the knees the previous ones are
switching short this I feel like is
bordering on too long I really love this
material what I might do is take both of
them to Monaco with the labels on and
then see which one I decide to wear
while I'm there and there's nothing
wrong with doing that right as long as
I'm not going to wear both of them out
so yeah we'll see maybe I'll just take
both of them because it's so hard to
decide I just don't know what to do okay
next up this one is actually an ace off
own-brand piece and it looks really
gorgeous on the photon website it's
basically a jumpsuit so this goes down
into wide leg trousers and then it's off
the shoulder so you've got Bill
attachment here and then it does
actually have long
but it's got cold-shoulder effect so I'm
in sympathy with the skin look like on I
feel like it could potentially be a
little bit baggy around the waist so it
may need a belt or something and then
down here on the bottom of the trousers
it's got this sheer panel with some
embroidery it's a really nice detail
this was around 40 pounds as well so
very affordable I think the Moon River
dress is maybe around the 80 pounds
they're not quite so affordable but
again I thought it'd be really lovely
from the evenings and just a very
relaxed holiday vibe so let's give that
a try okay so this is the jumpsuit I'm
really not too sure about this one first
of all is a real fast to get on because
you have to like thread your arms
through the sleeves and then because
there's all these holes here you have to
make sure you're putting on in the right
hole it feels kind of priority with this
like tie detail down at the bottom and
this cuff I feel a little bit like
Captain Jack Sparrow but not without the
bad thing I mean I like the overall idea
of it I really like this embroidered
section around the waist here and at the
pattern on the bodice area of the dress
and yeah it is quite see-through so if
you're a little bit damp from like just
getting out water if you try to put over
a bikini and this was definitely go
see-through yeah I don't know there's
just a few things that make me not 100%
happy with this but again let me know
what you guys think I do really like the
detail on the hems of the trousers so
that is really effective and as almost
like a 70s vibe to this which I really
like it okay the next thing I ordered is
three sets of underwear microfiber and
pretty late Snickers I'm not going to
get those out to show you and there's
triple points day so I thought I'd buy
my essentials so got myself some
knickers so I also got a few things from
misguided but again via the Asus website
and everything on that misguide you just
seems to having a really good season at
the moment so this is one things I
bought I think this was it really really
cute with white blouse or a little white
silk vest top it's a skirt and it's very
much like this shirt style material so
you've got the horizontal stripes and
then this really effective ruffle going
all the way through which I think it's
going to look really nice and photos and
it's not very high quality it's very
thin doesn't have a lining it just
folded over but it has got an invisible
zip it seems to be a nice shape so
fingers crossed that looks good on
because it looks like it should be a
really really cute numbers let's give it
a try I absolutely love this skirt I
feel like the pattern of the way that
it's almost like that shirt material is
really on trend at the moment I don't
have many blue things in my wardrobe but
I feel that this all mix them really
nicely with all the white top so I've
got this is a river item one that I got
in a haul a couple of months ago and if
I can find it's on the website or leave
it links because it's such a practical
top and I get loads of youth outfit I
think that the blue and white skirts and
the white tops that's really nice
together really like this ruffle detail
I think it's really effective it's a
nice tan Blake's this will look really
nice it is a little bit shorter than
what I would normally wear or granny
over here but because it's so cute and
definitely willing it to make an
exception for it so let me know if you
guys think is cute or is it too young
for me
upon you Ivan just said that but that's
all it definitely does cross my mind
I've somehow managed to buy three sets
of knickers I don't know how I've done
that I'm going to see how many they've
charged me for but I definitely didn't
order three so next up is a pair of
jeans these are again Miss Selfridge
friar a so what attracted me to these
was the embroidery I just feel like
embroider is really nice way to add a
slightly different touch to some jeans
but without making them too out there
you know it's still very wearable these
are a mom style fit so Janice that's how
you say it like a monster and you need
to have a more American accent that I do
but yes they're not going to be terribly
close fitting which I'm not sure if
that's going to suit me but I'm really
determined to get some slightly
different jeans and my wardrobes just
mix it up a little bit so we'll see how
these look I'm really pleasantly
surprised with these jeans I did not
think that I'd be such a huge fan of
this mum fit but actually I really like
them they're fairly well fitted on the 5
and then there's a little bit looser
than most like skinny jeans down at the
bottom really like the rolled-up hem as
well and this embroidery just makes them
a little bit more feminine which is
definitely something that makes a lot
more appealing to me you seem really
comfortable as well because they are so
high-waisted make some quite flattering
on the bum and yeah definitely really
comfortable because you only need to
worry about like 18 months and you've
got a bit of a tummy going on then yeah
it just keeps everything held in so I'm
going to keep a hold of these and see if
I get wear out of them I think it's
going to one of those things where I
keep the receipt and if I haven't worn
them in three weeks time then that's
fine that I need to send them back then
we'll help do that if you like this a
really good tactic for shopping so
that's going to be my tactic with these
okay so this is the first time I've ever
actually done this basically I saw this
dress and this is a Miss Selfridge dress
and I totally fell in love with it but
they didn't have a size four six or
eight I'm a six normally but I can kind
of fit in fill it or fear those sizes
they didn't have it but I loved it so
much they actually went ahead and
ordered a size 10 it looks like this
which is just so self-portrait II I
think it looks so expensive in fact I
have a self portrait dress that really
reminds me of this with the same kind of
embroidery detail around the neckline
around the shoulders and then this lace
on the arms the really nice length as
well for little summer days on the beach
but it is going to be too big for me so
I'm gonna try it on I'm going to try
pinching it in and see if I think that
it might be able to be tailored because
at 55 pounds I feel like this is such a
good self-portrait you give the moon
this is two sizes too big I can
definitely get a feel for it and
especially if I kind of pull it in
around the waist this is pretty much
what it's going to look like when it's
altered to be honest it's not as nice as
I thought it was going to be I feel like
this particular lace is a little bit
cheaper maybe a little bit old-fashioned
but what I really love that is this
detail I think is it is fun to keep it
I'm actually going to cut off this lace
so that it's purely the you know this
bit on the shoulder I don't want to keep
this bit but yeah I do really like it
I'm just not sure if it's worth the
efforts of taking it in I think I might
do is send this one back
and if I can find my size in the store
and give that a try
let me know what you guys think so this
is the final thing in my eighth of order
I actually tweeted a link to the sign
Sorek so it was so cute this is
basically a velvet pink dressing-gown I
get three dressing hands pretty quickly
actually because Dexter really likes to
chew them he likes to shred little holes
in them and so I do have to check out my
dressing gallons maybe every couple
months which considering how much I wear
them is probably most hygienic things do
anyway so I was in the market for a new
want my spotted this one and actually
because it's not that really thick
fluffy material it should be a little
bit better now that it's warming up a
bit so it's gorgeous almost like crushed
pink velvet it's got a polyester lining
so it's going to be nice and cool on the
skin so again really good for the warmer
months you've got the Zilla lats Highway
so you expect to have with a dressing
gown and the color I just think it's
absolutely gorgeous so definitely going
to keep this one but I'll still show you
a little Tryon clip anyway next up is
River Island and I'm guessing the from
the side this box so I probably ordered
a few pairs of shoes I can't quite
remember so let's just dig in and see
what I ordered okay so the first thing
in my river island order is a little hat
and I picked us up because every summer
I tend to buy a new beach hat and I just
felt that this really takes so many
boxes for what seems to be on trend this
year when it comes to hat design first
of all straw hats just aren't going
anywhere as a trend I think they always
look so classic and I also wanted to
have one with a little bit of white in
it this year so I saw this one and it
was such good value from River Island I
think it was yeah 18 pounds so really
affordable you can spend so much money
on hats and at the end of the day I
really don't think there's much
difference between them this one it's
just really nice it's got this nice
detail in the middle is found of like
straw and white woven in together and
then you've got a little gold
RI detail on there as well just a really
classic design this'll look so lovely
with just a plain cotton or linen beach
shirt and a really cute little bikini
just a very stylish and timeless Beach
holiday essential next up is a pair of
sunglasses and I spotted these on the
website and I thought they looked so
much more expensive than they were
these were only 14 pounds and yet I
swear they could be key they could be
like searching the barn or mew-mew ones
I just think they're absolutely
beautiful
the shape of them is perfect from my
kind of face shape because they do have
a silk cap flick which I find really
really flattering and this is like a
light tour toys and you got the aviator
bar and then this little pink fit over
the ear so really my perfect sunglass
design 14 pounds I'm definitely taking
these with me to Monaco tomorrow and on
lots of other upcoming summer trips so I
wanted to buy a handbag for my summer
holidays that wasn't a design at one
because I feel like I love this straw
bag trend but I just I don't know if
it's going to last forever and it's not
something that I want to spend loads of
money on so much fun well that live a
Prada one I think it's probably over a
thousand pounds so definitely not keen
for that but I thought this one on
revenant I really like the fact that the
straw was a little bit metallic so it
gives it a bit more of an edge for
nighttime wear and then you've got this
white straw down the middle and then a
white faux leather at the back the only
issue I have with this bag is the gold
River Island logo in the middle I don't
know why they do that it's so annoying I
just almost wish it was like a plane
track or something not that I am NOT
proud to have reliant on my clothing my
love River Island I just don't really
want it in the middle my handbag you
guys know what I mean or I might have
been really weird I like the fact this
got a really long strap but then you can
also try to get rid of first you can see
you can wear it just with a little
handheld bit or you can have it at the
crossbody so really practical bag and it
seems to be quite roomy as well you've
got a little pocket in the front and in
the main section very practical so let
me know what you guys think about this I
mean it's really practical for some
holidays but this just really bugs me
okay so this is what I was most excited
to receive and this is actually the
piece that made me make the order at the
moment I'm kind of obsessed with lemon
print I think it's because of the dolce
gabbana designs
I just think wrap see gorgeous but this
is a bikini on the website it looks
absolutely amazing I'm hoping it looks
that good on me definitely wearing too
much I just thought this was so
beautiful so fun I mean
it's 20 pounds so I was absolutely blown
away by this to the top again great if
you have boobs on the slightly small
inside like I do because you know you're
never going to get any cleavage with
this kind of bamboo top so you might as
well just look really cute while you're
at it although that is a little tiny bit
of padding in there but oh my goodness
how adorable is this this just for me
ticks so many of the summer trends I
feel like this very almost Italian
moving over towards Cuban a very
colorful fun print is what we're going
to see everywhere and it's
off-the-shoulder it's got ruffles and
then at the bottoms what I love about
red wine in bikini bottoms is that the
actual bum bit isn't too big I don't
like having loads of fabric on my bum it
just looks a bit like nappy I like it's
even more flattering and this definitely
is the front bit actually looks really
narrow so yeah hopefully it's not too
revealing but I am so excited to try
this on and you guys are going to be
seeing this all over my Instagram so I
apologize in advance for holiday and
bikini spam okay this is just absolutely
adorable it's everything I was hoping
for just a really really cute design
really fun and I feel like it's quite
flattering as well normally I like to
have fairly high waisted bikinis to
cover up this area but considering I
just had a barbecue we like mac and
cheese I'm not too unhappy with how my
body looks it's quite nice on the bum as
well it's fairly small as I said earlier
the top is pretty tight so I think if
you're like between sizes on the tops
and you could definitely go a size
larger I really like how you're going to
get a nice tan up here really like this
ruffle detail I think in fact I may
order a size up just because this was
actually fairly hard to get on but
overall the color the pattern I just
absolutely love this and I feel like I'm
going to get a lot of use out of this in
my upcoming holidays by the way I'm
gonna leave links to this and everything
else that I've mentioned in the hall as
always in my description box so just
click show more if you want to go to the
direct links to shop any of these pieces
so this is another really gorgeous kind
of holiday piece this
is a crop top and I think it's going to
be too short but it should just cover
the tummy button in once again this
almost shirt stripe material and then
you've got these really beautiful almost
batwing sled arms which I think it's
going to be really really effective the
back of this has got the phone's going
down it which looks really cute and then
once again you've got this ruched detail
in the middle so it's going to really
cling to the body and I think this is
going to be really effective with white
jeans white shorts maybe denim skirt so
I'm really looking forward to signing
this up in my upcoming trips so the top
I'm not a hundred percent decided on
first of all I'm not actually a huge fan
of where it falls because if I do any
moving whatsoever it kind of creeps up
and shows my tummy button which I'm not
the biggest fan of the back is really
nice detail with the bow I really like
that the sleeves are absolutely
gianormous I feel like I could fly away
in these but yeah I'm just not too sure
I think it's some language that's really
putting me off maybe if I had like a
superhighway to try houses although
these are pretty high waisted and you
can still see the tummy button so yeah
not entirely sold on the top but let me
know what you guys think I also picked
up this summer dress I don't know how I
feel about it in real life I think I
preferred it on the website the material
just looks a little bit cheap and but
maybe once it's had a good iron it
should be okay it was 30 pounds you've
got this I wish I knew the proper name
for this like stretchy effects on the
sleeves and then it's embroidered like
lacy cutout design it's going to be off
the shoulder so another spring trend or
summer trend in the bag then you've got
this lace scalloped edge down at the
bottom so it's got lots of really
beautiful design details and I really
like this color I'm just not too sure on
the overall effects so I'm going to give
it a try and you guys can let me know
whether you think I should keep it or
not
okay I feel like I jumped for the
conclusion too quickly with this dress
and actually I'm a big fan because it
was so easy to just chuck on I think
when I go on some on holidays I always
look for those pieces I think is really
quickly they're gone really quickly over
my bikini whether it's alone
or like going to the next part of the
beach or something and this because it's
so stretchy you can just shove on really
quickly you could almost like use it as
you're getting change strap that you
could quickly switch your bikini
underneath dead it's really floaty it's
very kind of Santorini style Beach dress
and it was pretty affordable as well so
actually I'm going to keep it after
saluting it a second ago let me know you
guys think and yeah pretty just abyssal
actually and last but not least from
River Island I picked up a pair of jeans
I'm still just constantly on the lookout
for an amazing pair of jeans and I felt
that these looks like a really nice
color and a really nice fit so fingers
crossed they look good they were 42
pounds they're really affordable you've
got this roar just basically cut hem at
the bottom which i think is really nice
and then you've got holes but they're
not in like the middle of your kneecap
so not too obvious
hopefully these getting really
flattering so let's give them a try and
find out big fan of these jeans I think
I could potentially have gone a size up
they are pretty darn tight but then I
have just had a really big barbecue so
maybe that's to blame and really like
the color really like the elasticity I
like where the holes are they seem to be
in like really flattering places they're
not too big and I really like the wash I
really liked it as super dark and then
you've got this like faded section that
goes down and then I think they're
really flattering a nice length on me as
well considering I've got little short
legs I really like their roar at the
bottom
so yeah the jeans are definitely going
to be a keeper okay so that's everything
I picked up from ASOS and River Island
recently I really hope you guys enjoyed
this haul and try on let me know which
ones are your favorites in the comments
below and if you think I should send
anything back is there anything I should
definitely keep because I really do take
your opinions very seriously I always
check the comments after my holes and
yeah it's really nice for me to know
what you guys think so definitely let me
know your thoughts in the comment

enjoyed it and some more holes and then

little bit more traveling I'm flying to
