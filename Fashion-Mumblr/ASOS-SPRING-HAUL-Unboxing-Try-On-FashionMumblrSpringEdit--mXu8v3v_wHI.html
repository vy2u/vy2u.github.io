subscribe button and that way you will

videos so that would make my day if you
do decide to subscribe today's videos to
finish things off with a bang is what I
am known best for what I love doing
what you guys really love it's an esop
haul and this is a spring and also a
holiday themed a tough haul with lots of
really beautiful pieces inside so I
cannot wait to wear so much so I've
actually already opened the box so I'm
just going to get straight stuck in
there with the first piece which is this
beautiful pale pink jumper and you may
remember from my spring wardrobe basics
number
I said that a really lovely lightweight
pastel colored jumper is such a gorgeous
things having your water for spring
because often it's a little bit chilly
but we still want to have these really
night fresh colors so I felt that this
was absolutely perfect for that pearls I
will mention in my spring trends video
and is a really big trend this spring so
this jumper really does take two boxes
plus its new look via a sauce and
knowingly doesn't say the price but I
seem to remember it being incredibly
affordable this color as you guys know
in my attic you favor as well so if you
have similar colorings and similar
preferences to me then I'm sure you will
love this just as much as I do
and then from spring in the UK to spring
abroad or summer abroad my next purchase
is this absolutely amazing straw bag
I've got a bit of an obsession with
straw bags and but I tensor this is
really frivolous but I can't forget
anyone but every holiday that I go on
and I know that's really bad and I
should not be so frivolous but I
couldn't actually with just this one and
not something goes I love the simplicity
of this bag just with the Flamingo and
going around the front and the designer
is South Beach
again this was incredibly affordable a
lot of structure and of the shape of
this and tragic but sure I think it's
going to be really Instagram well and
it's lined it's spacious it's basically
the perfect beach bag so I'm really
really chuffed with that absolutely love
it and I'm excited to use that my next
holiday next up is a pair of sunglasses
a socks own brand are absolutely
smashing it at the moment when it comes
to sunglasses I feel like last year we
kind of were forced into spending our
money on the key sunglasses price
increase
remember when they change the prices
from like 18 pounds to 40 pounds with
all that fur
what do we do for this year eight
thoughts have got incredible sunglasses
in their own brand section equally as
stylish and these have got rose tinted
lenses and then you've got this thin
rose gold frame and then you've got the
boar across the middle the arms are also
rose gold quite flimsy so these aren't
going to last you a lifetime but perfect
for a couple of summers in the Sun I
think these are a beautiful shape as
well the fact that they're slightly
Kassai and I find really flattering
they're very mirrors as well which I
accept I always think it's quite funny
seeing people's reactions when you talk
to them wearing mirrored sunglasses
because they can't quite resistor
looking at themselves so a little bit
funny when you try to have a
conversation with someone and and you're
wearing mirrored sunglasses try it out
if you don't know I mean because it's
quite a lot next up we have a pair of
trousers which are actually pretty
little thing but I bought them on a
sauce and these I thought would be such
a beautiful spring and also summer
trouser
they've got a very subtle frill
on the pocket which is pretty much what
rhythm to me as well as a very
affordable price tag there elasticated
so hopefully they're going to be
incredibly comfortable I find white
trousers such a gorgeous things having
your wardrobe in spring you could pair
this with a baby pink cotton t-shirt
with a great silk blouse or a denim
jacket that would look really really
cool with something like this because
they're elasticated they're going to be
super comfortable we can wear them
barbecues and allow yourself to expand
stay away from the ketchup because
they're white elbows material is
definitely going to find the washing
machine I think that's from the pocket
is just so so gorgeous and I love
childhoods with pockets in general but
the fact that they're pretty is just a
really gorgeous design detail they're
tapered down to being quite narrow at
the bottom so this should be quite
flattering I think with any mules that
you might have in your spring wardrobe
you look great and yeah super duper
concrete I'm excited to give these a try
so the trousers are an incredibly
comfortable fit but as you can see they
are very sheer I have a little bow on my
underwear and you can see it through the
trousers as well as being able to see
the pocket so don't know what to do
because they're so comfortable like
literally incredibly comfy they feel
like jogging bottoms the length is
gorgeous as well
unlike the fit they are a great fit
surprisingly flattering considering that
they are skin tight and like suctioned
to my body but yeah it's just such a
shame that they're so see-through it
feels almost like Roode wearing them I
mean you can see the exact outline of my
butt yeah I'm not sure I can keep these
I wish they would just make them a
little bit higher quality because design
wise I mean so nice with this frill I
just am obsessed with these pockets I
don't I can keep them with how clear
they are see through there hello
underwear here something from the moon
right around which if you've watched my
last two april fools
you'll know big fan of
and this is a little bit more casual
it's a gay dress you've got this
embroidery detail on the front which is
so beautiful and the edges are like a
fringe effect you've got some lace
embroidery around the edges and then
you've got some tiny detail on the
sleeves and it is a dress it's not a not
short I thought it might Bend shorts
you've got the same fringe detail at the
bottom material wise it's kind of linen
II which gives it a really lovely rustic
summer bohemian vibe to it because it's
Moon River I'm guessing it was fairly
pricey I guess around the 60-pound marks
but as with everything I'll need a link
down below so you can price check if you
want to and I'm afraid of cotton I will
try and vote on my head but this is
really beautiful I hope it's not too
stacked like because it doesn't really
have much of a figure to it maybe that's
the look but we'll give it a try and
find out so this dress is incredibly
cute it's not trigger hugging obviously
but that's just the style of it as you
can see the only downside is you really
can't wear like normal underwear with
this because you can see all of it you
have to wear probably a bikini top or no
bra underneath it the embroidery is
looks actually beautiful I really like
this detail and the way that it's
finished around the edges and yeah it's
really nice length fairly conservative
just above for me but still showing a
nice amount of leg I think this is a
really great holiday piece definitely
one for throwing over a bikini and I
bought one more thing from Moon River
this is a holter neck because the
jumpsuit yes that goes into little
shorts at the bottom I thought this
would just look so fun if you've got any
Greek holidays coming up musn't have to
be a pretty positive I just thought
against the whitewashed buildings that
you see in the Greek island this would
just look so fun I like that it's a
hostnet bit almost like own concerning
with this type of neckline almost like
bitter style so it's going to tie around
the neck in that way all of your back is
open to the elements so great if you've
got a chance back and then hopefully yes
it's got little pockets which we all
know how fabulous pockets are unlike the
last one it's got a drawstring waist
you can really accentuate the narrowest
part of your body on your waist
and then little tassels on the bottom of
the strings and fairly short short so
it's going to be quite leg revealing but
I think this is a real holiday piece
that hopefully you won't mind showing a
little bit of like the overall effect of
this jumpsuit I really really like I
feel like the colors it is awesome for
holidays I really really like this neck
detail but there's just something about
it that I'm not entirely sure about and
I can't pinpoint it obviously it needs
ironing I really I just really like the
way that the shoulders are revealed I
think it's really an elegant body part
to show that makes sense I'm just not
sure there's something about this that
I'm not entirely sure about I don't know
if it's like this baggy bit here and I'm
finding a little bit unflattering nice
you can cinch in the waist though not
too sure I'm 50/50 on this one so I'm
going to have to get you guys to let me
know your thoughts yeah people not keep
that with the question so this next
piece wrapped in tissue paper is a
little clutch bag I thought this was so
effective this is miscut Geiger so a
little bit more affordable and cargile
occur Geiger but I thought this was just
so beautiful it's gold and then you've
got this sparkling glittery laser-cut
beads on the front revealing a more
metallic floral design very thin it's an
envelope clutch bag inside you probably
just about our room for your money
maybe a lip gloss from blotting sheets
and your phone so I'm not really too
much if you've got a camera then it's
not going to fit inside here but when
you're on holiday or springtime if
you've got any like early summer
barbecues you can just tuck this under
your arm and it's such a lovely bag and
it's almost very cold it's more of a
yellow gold but I feel that makes it
really nice and versatile I love
metallic accessories I feel that they go
with so many different outfits
so I'm looking for giving this
in summer the next thing I plucked from
the box is a shoebox and the brand is
Miss Selfridge now I remember what these
are our tale so lovely designer s shoes
but without the price tag here they are
all what about in all white so they're
almost like peachy maybe it's the
lighting in here how gorgeous are these
so they looked kind of along the same
line and the sameen pointed shoes that
we saw on the catwalk you're seeing this
style here down everywhere on the high
street Zara have got some of this style
Topshop I've got some other style and
yeah these ones are Miss Selfridge I'm
really intrigued to try these I think
these will look absolutely gorgeous with
a pair of jeans also denim skirt I can
use look fabulous
culottes these will look gorgeous I
really hope I can walk in them I hope
they don't rub here and because they're
so comfortable there are 39 pounds which
is actually the most affordable of all
the flats and heels and like low block
yields others that other I've seen so
fingers crossed there country is there
great value and I think they would look
so elegant and leg-lengthening as well
because they don't have any strap
instead they just go down to a point so
it should be incredibly flattering
especially if your short legs like iron
next we have something from boohoo oh
this is a cute little pair of short so I
just love in the summer when it gets
warmer and also when I'm on holiday I
love having a pair of shorts that are
just very classic you can stick over the
top of the key of Awesome's if you want
heading to restaurant or on boat or
something for lunch then it's absolutely
perfect
these have got a lip I actually think I
had this exact pair but like the last
year version last summer but I was
wearing a thumb cream that tinted done
and working yellowy color so I think I
gave them to charity shops but yeah I
think these will be getting a lot of use
from me in the summer just a beautiful
classic parasol so the short so
everything that I was hoping for they're
just a really nice fit actually a little
bit big for me I think I did get a size
six
so don't know how that's happened lip up
the side I mean they're not
thing like special special but they're
exactly what I wanted for like throwing
on over a bikini they don't have any
pockets but they're just really nice
floral lace design at the white color
obviously where the term is just
seriously lovely and yeah a really good
price as well so definitely definitely
keeping these next up is a piece from a
Tularosa and is it not the charity
affordable brands but I really have to
love the pieces that I try on from here
and what I really loved about this was
the neckline so it actually got boning
over the chest area so there's boning in
the lining here we should like that this
plastic which really helps to keep the
structure of a garment which means that
it's going to be you know three halves
the scribe it's really going to have a
lovely shape to it it has got a little
shoulder straps that's going to be a
cold shoulder style and then you've got
this very again a bohemian rustic style
fabric it's almost got like different
colors darting through it and then
you've got this embroidery or actually
more like a-- and they stand at the
bottom so i'm really looking forward to
trying this on it's also got a zip at
the back so easy to get on and get off
could be again a really great bikini
coverup and summer party drop this top
is just gorgeous
I think this neckline is so so
flattering imagine if you are super
turned on holiday could just put a
little bit of that shimmering oil on
your chest of your collarbone it's so
lovely it's not very long as you can see
I'm wearing it with a short not sure if
I've spoken about these or not yet but
also with denim shorts I think this
would look so gorgeous the bottom detail
is really really beautiful again if
you've got something a bit more low than
that against the tum tummy that looks
beautiful
I really like the sleeve detail as well
I think that's just so beautiful chilled
Beach five bohemian style really really
liked that I think this is one of my
favorite kind of holiday pieces that
I've got soaked up and then I believe
this is the last thing in the hole it is
from Miss Selfridge and it is any eighth
metric top so this is just a really
classic thing for spring and summer very
on trend because you've got these
ginormous thrills running down the
sleeve quite plain I mean it's just a
normal cotton material but you've got
this ruffle detail going all along the
neckline the second arm is going to be
cold shoulder and hopefully be a little
bit like this this one will go round the
arm that the shoulder will be reveal
whereas this one will for a little bit
more on top of the shoulder very hard to
show you like this so let's just skip to
the triumphing I'm undecided on this one
and there's something about it which
doesn't feel quite right it feels a
little bit weird having one arms so
materialised and then one arm just
completely free I mean I like the
material I like the frill I like the
white very flattering on a tan but I
think that there are a lot of frills
tops ruffled tops on the market at the
moment and I'm not sure this is my
favorite one let me know what you guys
think it is cool but sleeved HL detail
is really nice it's good with jeans with
the Miss Selfridge shoes love don't
really knows and let me know your
thoughts and that's everything in my
spring a soft hole I'm sure this will
not be the last haul that is sure and so
keep an eye on my channel for more lace
or schools let me know if there are any
other retailers that you think are doing
spring particularly well because as I
think I've said in every single one of

favorite season of fashions of beauty

if you picked up any fabulous pieces of
you're excited to a spring and also just
