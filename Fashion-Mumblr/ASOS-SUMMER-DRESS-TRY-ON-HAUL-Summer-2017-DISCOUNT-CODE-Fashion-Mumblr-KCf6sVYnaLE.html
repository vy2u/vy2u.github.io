joining me for today's video it feels so
good to be sitting down doing a normal a
phone call it feels like forever since I
did this we have a house renovated so
it's a little bit manic to say the least
and my last one I think I just
surrounded by boxes so this feels good
feedback this video as you may have
noticed has gone live in a very weird
time and that's because today as you may
or may not know is an insane rivaling
Black Friday sale day on a soft foam
edge get this video up to give you the
rest of the day 24 hour only sale and
release make your mind up and see if you
wanted to get anything so 20% of the
entire site and that's using a discount
code which I will leave in the
description box down below a little
birdie told me about this sale a few
days ago so I have made an April order
and of my own and hopefully just might
inspire you make up a few of these
pieces so don't make this video too long
you guys have got new shopping to do so
I'm going to get straight back in there
alright well hey making all that noise
if your brother and me
I had never person box before we've only
had Vicky for less than a week so the
first time I said embark I'm gonna leave
you two to play and carry on with my
April Fool so hopefully we won't get to
interrupted by dog barking let me show
you what I picked up from ASA
okie dokie first of all I picked up this
beautiful top which is actually a Miss
Farish top but I thought I did actually
have it in my Miss Selfridge basket but
then when I saw the 8th of sale I
thought why not get it at 20% off this
is just such a versatile top I can
imagine wearing this with jeans wearing
this my suede skirt it's got a beautiful
beauty detail with that like pie crust
drilling on please really big beautiful
white peas but it is at the end of the
day just a plain white cotton shirt so
very very versatile this meals 20
eight pounds full price sorts that like
five pounds off so this is an incredibly
affordable piece I think it's the kind
of thing that all of us just can have in
our wardrobe and we'll get loads of
those aware L so I think I can imagine
what it looks like on but let's give it
a try anyway really like this blouse I
can definitely imagine getting a lot of
use out of this it's very light and airy
I can imagine just wearing this on
really warm days and because it's so
floaty I definitely don't think I'll
overheat and this looks really nice
again with a bit of a statement necklace
with some jeans and nice little court
shoes a very plain simple outfit but the
seeds that give it a really nice detail
so yes definitely another keeper I think
so these are an example of the model
just totally selling something to me
because she looks so insane in these
trousers these are high-waisted pull up
their child's in beautiful baby pink
almost peachy color
they look very like they've got so much
fabric in them so hopefully it's going
to have a really nice drape to it they
are very high waisted they've got some
treating detail and they look like
they're going to be really narrow at the
way so it's clean very flattering and I
should get a really lovely for the wet
selfies quality wise they feel pretty
good it's a really nice quite thick
material you've got a hidden zips you've
got this extra button here just to keep
everything in place and the fabric does
look like it's got a really lovely drape
to it I will be interested to see how
they wash because I feel there could be
a little bit prone to creasing but
fingers crossed they'll be okay
they look like a very again versatile
piece I can imagine talking a silk
blouse on to these and wearing it for
work things like that so let's give them
a try I will pair them with something
quite some neutrals give you an idea of
what I was styling with okay so if you
ignore the fact that this top and the
trousers
both desperately need ironing I think
this is a seriously cute outfit they
actually look a little bit more pinky
when they're compared to a white top and
as you can see there are a little bit
sheer but this material is fairly thick
so nothing is being revealed
I think this light is making it look a
little bit worse than it is fit wise I
think that absolutely beautiful they
were a little bit tight coming of my
hips so if you're between sizes I've
maybe say to go up a size but they're
incredibly comfortable I really like
them with this style of shoe
as well I not sure if I posted the video
on these yet but they are dupes from the
website called Shion I'll leave links
them down below I just love them so much
so yeah big famine thieves I think it's
a really nice sunny different summer
outfit it looks a little bit like a
skirt actually but really like how these
full big fan of these so yeah definitely
keeping okay so this kind of looks a
little bit boring off but on a model it
looks amazing so I'll try and sort of
photos here at it on the model this is a
lace overlay dress with a nude lining it
looks very short so I'm not going to lie
if it's not too short and then it's got
these straps which are too tight over
the shoulder in a little bow just to
give it shoulder support because you
could wear it as a bandeau but I
probably it doesn't have any of that
sticky hold up material here so I
probably will entrust it as a bandeau
this I felt was very self portrait style
I really like how it's got the bigger
embroidery down the bottoms it'll have a
very interesting hemline really looking
for chiness went on to see how I style
it so let's do it right okay so luckily
this is not quite as short as I was
anticipating but it is still fairly
short for me got a little bit of side
going on there I'm such a granny really
like the detail on this one it does
definitely have some self-portrait vibes
to it but you can kind of tell just from
the cut that it is a lot more affordable
than self-portrait I'm tempted to put
some slightly more notorious ribbons on
the straps here there's nothing wrong
with these but I do feel like they are a
little bit of a giveaway when it comes
to the quality of the garment I really
like the band around the waist I'm not
sure what this little kind of folding in
the stitching is and I love this lace
applique around the hem as well I think
it's very ladylike yeah I think I'll
keep this one it's so affordable and
it's very striking a really nice one to
have in the water of the summer so next
up you may recognize this hot part of
this this is from French Connection
again via a sauce such a good time to
invest in
those higher end pieces that banging you
can hear is sticking dragging one of my
students around the kitchen floor I'm
sorry about that and that's it yeah this
is the dress version of the top that I
love hold in here are you
daaad in promoting so this is the dress
version of the tops that I just adore
from French Connection
I wear the top app that you load so I'm
very optimistic about the dress
the only issue I have with the top is
that the hook and eye at the fasteners
that you tend to come undone quite
easily so I may actually replace this
hook night with a button but I'll give
this a try hopefully it fits into these
fears the top does this so I'm gonna be
getting so much wear of this that's on
so this dress is pretty much exactly how
I imagined it to be
top wise it's very similar to the French
Connection top that I have been wearing
a lot recently I'm actually holding it
at the moment so I feel like it looks a
bit better pinched in this is how it is
normally so I might just alter it a tiny
bit I'll probably be able to take it in
at the corners here really like the
detail around the neckline it really
frames any pretty necklaces there's a
really nice delicate feminine sleeve
area I think I might wear this to where
am I going
Wentworth for the golf on Sunday
probably the day before this video goes
live so you might have already seen this
on my Instagram lengthwise I think it's
really the perfect length for me just
over the knees really floaty this is the
kind of thing that I know that in my
wardrobe I will just reach for over and
over again and some are such an easy
thing to decide and yeah very much my
style next up is this giant floral wave
of fabric it's got its really
interesting detail at the back and then
you've got this nice kind of paneling a
huge amount of ruffles at the front it
is a dress it looks like it could be
quite short but I feel like when you've
got this much fabric it doesn't really
matter if it's fairly short but I've
been really looking for dresses that I
can just fling on and not really have to
worry about the rest of my outfit you
know these are the kind of dresses that
they are your entire outfit you can just
grab them and go and be confident that
you look really really good I'm hoping
that this will be along those lines
really looking forward to trying this
one on
and the brand is yes why a s which I've
not tried before so fingers crossed
because if I like it then I'm home
wearing this a lot this summer I can
imagine wearing this to a lot of like
garden parties and things like that okay
so I feel a little bit like the court
jester in this because it's so roughly
it reminds me of yeah you know I mean
when the court jester wears this really
ruffled white likes a ball almost
definitely feels kind of like that
that's the summer garden party that kind
of thing I think is really pretty I love
the floral material fits really nicely
and I really like this kind of mesh
detail at the top here it was quite hard
to get on I just kind of had to throw it
over my head and hope for the best
because of all of the desiccant see them
there all of the straps at the back but
it does have a zip closure and opening
here at the side I think the bodice is
really nice shape I kind of wish it was
a little bit more simple at the top
because I don't mind a voluminous skirt
and the length is really really lovely
but maybe a little bit too much here
I guess if I had my hair down and in
some waves then it would look much
better but I feel a bit like a pea head
with my hair scrape back in a ponytail
the material is really lovely really
nice and lightweight for summer so yeah
I am a fan definitely let me know what
you guys think I value your opinions and
you guys will let me know if I look like
a bit of a tit in this and then last but
not least this is something I've had my
eye on for so long I've really really
wanted it but kind of needed that final
push in order to invest in it so the 20
cent off was the final straw for me I
decided to splurge it is this gorgeous
bag from Ted Baker so it's white over
shoulder or over body bag it's got this
long rose gold chain but what I love
about it is that it's got a little rose
gold robot on the clasp I think it's so
cute the little smiley robot with a
heart for a mouth and I think you
squeeze his arms to get in I'm not too
sure oh it's actually just one giant
magnet so it's much easier inside you've
got this little envelope area here
they're really good for your oyster card
and then one big pocket with a
compartments and then another little
envelope section here this is definitely
big enough for an iPad Mini I forget my
person here my camera my phone a few
makeup compact really decent size but
also small enough to be used as an
occasion bag which I feel when it's
white and rose gold it's definitely
going to be something a little bit
smarter also if you wear navy denim or
dark colored denim at all that will
probably rub on this kind of material so
definitely going to be conscious of
luckily our very lot of pastels I hope
it won't be too much an issue I'm really
looking forward to starting this up if
you guys had your eye on anything
recently whether it's my crease or
French Connection whistles Ted Baker
then now hasn't really time to buy it so
