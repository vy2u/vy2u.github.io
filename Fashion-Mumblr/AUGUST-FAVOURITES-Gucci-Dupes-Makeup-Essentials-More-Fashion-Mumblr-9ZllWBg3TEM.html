for joining me for today's video which
is my oddest favourites so you know the
job I now at the end of every month or
beginning of the following month I just
let you know what products I have been
loving throughout the month hopefully
you guys still find these videos
interesting I know a lot of youtubers at
the moment are saying they'd use to
enjoy them should they try something
else I personally think they are really
good fun I still love watching them
because I think it really does tell a
lot about the product if you've been
using them and loving them for a whole
month
so I'm Kerri I'm doing them if you guys
have any thoughts on that so I want me
to do something different then let me
know but for now I'm just going to stick
to the usual favorites routine this
month I have been fairly busy as per
usual and traveling quite a lot which
does mean that beauty wise I've pretty
much stuck to the same skin care routine
and the same beauty routine so a lot of
the favorites this month I'm not going
to go through because they were also in
last month's favorites like apparent BB
skin detox fluid that has been a
favorite and basically my whole skin
care routine hasn't really changed so
I'm going to start off with fashion
because I have got a few fashion
favorites this month and first of all
these loafers from River Island now I've
actually checked on the river ID website
this morning and they're still in stock
and the reason why I checked is because
these the kind of thing that I just know
are going to sell out because they're so
beautiful
I'm surprised that I haven't seen them
more on my Instagram I don't know if
it's just me that's obsessed with them
but I honestly think they are so
stunning they look a lot like Gucci
shoes that obviously slight dupes of
Gucci they're very inspired by the Gucci
autumn winter mules and I just love the
pattern on though you may have seen them
on my haul video they are black with the
embroidery and this beautiful buckle so
comfortable and I've been wearing them a
lot with Freight jeans and also denim
shorts skirts they just look fabulous
with so many
they look so much more expensive than
that price tag but yeah I don't think
these are gonna be around for too much
longer they are limited edition so I
will leave a link in description box to
all the products but definitely I would
not hang around if you want to treat
yourself to these I think they'll sell
out or just go up stock very very soon
my second monthly favorite is also a
fashion item and I spent quite a long
time this morning trying to find them
they are my pink Topshop pleated qalaat
razors I'll insert a photo here of me
wearing them but basically I spilt be
true on them at while I sat so a
farmhouse with origins asked them to
wash them for me because you need to
treat b-tree stains really quickly and
then I forgot to pick them up again so
hopefully so her farmhouse are going to
send them to me or send them back to me
otherwise I'm actually going to buy a
new pax I think they were only around 35
pounds and they are so comfortable I
love them with just so many different
outfits they look great with Bardot tops
they look great with strappy tops so
comfy and a really nice balance between
day and night so I'm wearing them so
much since I got them I think I featured
him in my cuts hoard outfit diary so
I'll leave that link down below if you
want to see them dressed up in action
and then my third monthly favorite which
is also kind of fashion related is this
beautiful pair of EMU slippers and I
feel like normally I would save slippers
until a slightly cooler month and even
though it is August and still pretty
warm nice matching September now as
already you become obsessed with these
slippers I only have one because Dexter
is currently sniffing the other one he's
asleep with his nose in it which is just
too cute for me to move him but I adore
Inu as a whole I was wearing now walking
boots all throughout my time in the
French Alps and these are I'm sure the
great just a beautiful Goldy pink
sparkly toe area and then you've got
this beautiful fur and more like
sheepskin I'm not sure if it's real
sheepskin fur I think it probably is
yeah so this is sheep fur and
that's so fabulous they look gorgeous I
was really thankful for these on this
state it's so her farmhouse cuz we were
in tents and we had to like dash to the
nearby barn to use the very luxurious
bathroom facilities so I was very very
thankful for these and I just so snuggly
is so comfy and I know that I will love
wearing these throughout the cooler
months and my final fashion favorite is
this handbag again you've probably
spotted this on my Instagram wearing my
vlogs etc etc but it is this bag from
Topshop I featured this first in my come
shopping with me on Oxford Street a full
video although very briefly I just
spotted it out of the corner of my eye
and I had to get it straight away it
looks quite similar to a few designer
bags especially further hat bags very
much of this style and size-wise it's
perfect because I do have an iPhone 6
plus and it doesn't fit in a lot of my
bags especially smaller bags but this is
perfect for my phone my camera my purse
and a few other essential items and the
fact that it's got this long strap means
you can just fling it over your shoulder
really comfortable great size and yeah
it tends to go with most things because
it is silver and gold so you're not
really restricted with what color you
wear it with I might as well get my
final non-beauty favorite out the way
and this one's quite random but is
upheld headphones so I because I have
been traveling a lot this month I have
been using my earphones quite a lot I
use them in the gym but also when
editing videos and these are from a
brand I think is called meze let me just
double check that yeah meze and these
are the Neo design I will leave a link
to these down below but when it comes to
earphones I'm quite picky and these are
just comfortable to wear the sound
quality is amazing which is really
important when I'm doing videos
especially through earphones because
when you guys for watching them they're
a lot louder and I know in the past
sometimes I've messed up when it comes
to sound because my earphones haven't
been good enough quality for me to pick
up those little noise differences
whereas these the sound quality
is really very good which is so
important comfy they look good and
they're also pretty hard where I'm like
this wire is very sturdy so even though
I do keep them in their case if I did
try from the bottom of my handbag I'm
sure they would they would survive so oh
and also the noise cancelling which is
great if you are editing on the girl in
a car on the plane which yeah again has
been really important for me this month
so thought I would include those in my
August favorites and on to beauty my
first Beauty favorites are a couple of
face refreshing and makeup setting
sprays I include it too because I've
been I've been using these a lot this
month loads of different types and I
wanted to include a high street and a
high end version and because it was
really warm this month and makeup does
tend to slide around turn the warmer
months so I have been using the makeup
setting spray on most days so the
L'Oreal infallible fixing this is a
really good drugstore version whereas
I've also been loving the Estee Lauder
set and refresh both of them do a really
good job but just making sure your
makeup stays perfect all day they're
also really refreshing I tend to use
this one more for top ups like June and
you know say 3 p.m. in the afternoon
when you start to feel like your skin is
getting a bit tired
this is also so so so refreshing whereas
this one is great for setting at the
beginning of the day and I also find it
mattifies just a little bit it's almost
a bit chalky and consistency you have to
make sure when you shake it up but that
just really sets the makeup and ensures
it lasts all day long
my next two Beauty favorites are from
Tom Ford and firstly their fiber brow
gel so I have tried a lot of brow gels
in my time and especially since I had my
brows micro bladed it's really become a
staple in my beauty routine because it
really helps to set the hairs and still
create a little bit of volume but
without being too too made up if that
makes sense but what makes this one so
different to the rest is that I feel
like the formula is actually quite
pigmented so it really does coach your
brows in the gel as well as setting them
in place and I think if you have got to
maybe light brow hair or if your brow
hair is really fine and you want to
create almost like werewolf brows you
can really control the level of volume
that you bring into your brows with
theirs
this is just such a good product for
that I have got the shade taupe which is
perfect for me I'm wearing it right now
and yeah since I had my brows micro
bladed and even if you just have normal
brows and you just want to set them
maybe you want to go for a natural look
you don't want to put too much liner in
then this will just be perfect but
equally if you have got perfectly made
up brows
they do not budge once this is on so
I've been loving using this I've been
using this every day without fail and
this next one I really wasn't expecting
to love as much as I do and now I'm
completely hooked on it it is the Tom
Ford shimmer shot and this you could
probably use as a bronzer all over your
face but actually I've been using it for
a really subtle summer contour so I just
put two pumps on my hand and I've been
using my Real Techniques concealer brush
to just really lightly blend it in in
the areas where you'd apply contour and
then blending the shade around my
forehead and under my chin just to
create a really lovely subtle and very
healthy glowing contour but what makes
it so good is that it's so blendable the
color I just find so natural I've tried
less expensive versions before and I've
not really liked the color
whereas this I just find so easy to use
so if like me you're a little bit phobic
of cream bronzers and contour then this
would be a really really good one to try
so if you watched my new in and first
impressions Beauty video you will not be
surprised to see this one in here and
it's a Too Faced melted matte liquefied
matte lipstick in the shade sell out so
I tried this live on the video for the
first time and it was love at first
sight the color the formula the
consistency is just so perfect so me and
I have been wearing this so much since
then I'm just absolutely obsessed with
them I think this is probably my
favorite launch of the year to date
that's a very big statement but I'm so
in love with these out of all the shades
I definitely think sell out is a perfect
one for me and I've just been sticking
it in my handbag using it to top up on
the go although I would say that it
lasts around five hours looking really
really perfect but also it is just
lovely to top it up if you really want
to have that lovely intense color
day two more things and my second last
is also come to face it is there
chocolate bar palette so you've got all
of these beautiful brown shades and now
I have been using salted caramel which
is this one here and also marzipan on an
almost daily basis I find that they are
so long-lasting at the end of the day
and so her farmhouse again with the
girls is like oh my gosh what are you
wearing on your iron is what have you
just topped up with and I said I have
not topped up since when I did my makeup
at 7 o'clock in the morning and this is
probably at 7 o'clock at night so
12-hour wear I did use the Too Faced
shadow insurance I just remembered I use
that but anyway these are incredibly
long-lasting really beautiful pigmented
colors and if you are a neutral girl
like me then this palette just has so
many so many options and again available
in suffrages it's so really really easy
to get your hands on you can buy them
online really quick and easy delivery
my final favorite is a hairbrush so I
haven't really changed my hairbrush in a
long time and I just didn't really feel
the need to but then I went and had my
hair cut at Michael Van Clark and he was
telling me about his hairbrush which is
the number one brush and I was like yeah
it's great but can it really be that
special but it is I really really
struggle with having my hair very chunky
when I get out the shower it takes me a
long time to brush through my hair but
not with this and I do get along very
well with tangle teasers but because
this has got the handle it just makes
brushing through my hair when it's wet
especially so easy I sometimes get wet
matted clumps of hair here and I find it
normally takes me about 10 minutes to
brush through my hair even after putting
in leave-in conditioner but with this
it's so so so easy and the bristles are
really gentle as well they're very
flexible more flexible than the tangle
teezer
so I don't feel like it's damaging my
hair so much it just it feels like it's
not working because it glides over hair
so easily but it does it my hair is
detangled within about 30 seconds which
for me is a big game-changer so I
thought I would mention this as well and
that is everything a fairly very random
selection of products I'd say but these
are all things I
absolutely been obsessed with it
throughout the month of August so as per
usual I will leave the links to all of
these bits and bobs
