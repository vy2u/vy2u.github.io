so this is a pretty big delivery from
Topshop I went to the Topshop show
during London Fashion Week and it was
probably the best show that I've ever
been to it was incredible I will leave
my fashion winter vlog up on the screen
and also down in description books but
that really inspired me to check out
their new collection because the runway
was shoppable right away which is just
insane
I actually didn't pick up any bits from
the catwalk yet but I definitely will be
let me show you what I got from my
latest online order alright so first up
we have a pair of shoes now I saw these
and I immediately thought they'd be such
a great way of dressing up a pair of
jeans firstly I love the fact that
they're closed toe I think that makes
them a lot more versatile this time of
year autumn winter but also with jumper
dresses they're just going to be a
really lovely
ladylike way or
making that outfit a little bit more
smart color wise is quite unusual for me
it's like a greeny brown and it's a
suede material the heel I really like I
think is going to be very comfortable
for a long day of walking around because
it is this block heel style and it does
have a rubber sole which just I find
generally makes use a lot more
comfortable also you've got an ankle
strap so if you do want to have that
very flattering style of having quite a
lot of foot showing but you don't want
your foot to be falling out an ankle
strap is a really good design detail so
very very happy with those these were 49
pounds so they're the first thing that I
picked it up from Topshop I also just
realized that you can see in the mirror
that I'm wearing Jackie bottoms
I thought because I cropped the camera
here you won't be able to tell but
that's what as youtubers do we wear cozy
on the bottom and nice on the top
speaking of which and this one I was
going to talk about when I talk through
the new look but this is from new look I
think it was about 27 pounds and I am in
love with it
it's a typical cozy chunky knit but then
you've also got these kind of frill just
basically wool hanging down from it and
then you've got this cable knit detail
love it with a simple called necklace
I've already worn us loads both in the
house and styled it out the house for
like meetings and things like that - big
fan of this one the only thing is that
the sleeves are a little bit long I do
sometimes quite like having the sleeves
going over my hands but equally it's
nice to roll them back - so yes that's
this jumper before I forget to tell you
about it everything of course as I
mentioned in this hall will be linked
down below so if you did want to check
anything out further details or shop
from yourself then there'll be links
down in the description box so just
click show more for more details so this
is a very different color for me it is
pretty much a black dress but it has got
these beautiful pink flowers on it
it's again very much like a Victoriana
style but it's the length of this dress
that I absolutely love this will convert
to just above my ankles she'll still be
able to see the footwear but it's gonna
be quite warm you could probably wear
like thermal tights underneath this and
definitely be able to get away with it
this time of year I absolutely love
wearing long dresses I've been wearing
jumper dresses so so much but this one I
thought was a little bit more smart and
if I've been wearing too many jumper
dresses I can switch this one in you've
got a beautiful ruffle detail on the
collar is
slight metallic flecks through it which
just gives it a really lovely detail and
then a little bit of embroidery and
detail around the sleeves - it does seem
to have a little bit of a pull in at the
waist and then you've got this ribbon
going around the waist as well to make
it even more feminine and almost like a
bib style across here so just so many
design details but because the fabric is
quite busy they do blend in so it's not
too wild I've been on the hunt for a
corduroy skirt for quite some time since
seeing my style icon julia angle from
gal meets chrome she's an American
blogger she wore a pink one it was
actually a regram from one of her
outfits last year but anyway since I saw
that photo I've needed to have a
corduroy skirt and I picked this one up
from Topshop it's a burgundy almost red
wine color I think I actually have some
very similar to this last year with this
pool detail in fact it was a pair of
qalaat that had this ring detail this
ring we're seeing in so many things at
the moment you might remember my Topshop
ankle boots that have this detail as
well so yeah it's a really lovely design
detail you've got these two little
pockets it's quite short so it could be
a nice one to our tights or you can make
it more casual even wearing with
something like this our cozy knit with
over new boots as well I think this will
be really gorgeous 34 pounds not too
expensive and I went for the size 6 in
this one so this piece here it was my
main reason for even making my Topshop
order in the first place I mentioned in
my video that was all about autumn
winter 17 trends again I'll leave it
linked on the screen definitely check
that video out it's gone down really
well I'm very pleased with the amount of
views that one's has so you guys
obviously liked it too but yeah in that
video I mentioned that cozy teddy bear
style coats are going to be a huge trend
this autumn and I have been looking out
for one that's firstly not ridiculous
price ie
not over 100 pounds because it's
definitely probably only gonna meet this
year that they're hugely popular but
also one that I just absolutely love and
I spotted this one on Top Shop they've
also got a pink one but I thought that
beige would be a little bit more
versatile this was 89 pounds I think
it's just absolute perfect love these
huge pockets love the thickness of the
material it has a lining as well so it's
not gonna be itchy on the skin you can
pull this collar up and wear it snug
around your neck so when it does get
really chilly in winter this is going to
be such a cozy one so again this is
going to be another piece you're going
to be seeing
all of my Instagram and will probably
sell out so I wouldn't recommend hanging
around on this one because by the time
November comes and the temperatures drop
they won't be in stores anymore and I
think you may regret it if you don't
pick it up so highly recommend grabbing
one of these now if you can imagine
yourself wanting to buy into this trend
later in the year finally from Topshop
this is a piece that I'm not too sure on
so definitely let me know in the
comments whether you think I should keep
this one or not it's a big bucket bag
and it's in this beautiful brownie blush
pink color which I absolutely adore it's
quite this rose gold ring on it again
we're seeing this ring everywhere and
then inside I don't realize it actually
opens by the fabric the leather going
over the ring inside you've got the
strap obviously this is still got the
packaging on it 34 pounds and then you
have got a separate canvas bag inside if
you want to separate out your bits and
bobs I find this time of year I often
want to have lots of extra things with
me if it gets colder I like to bung a
scarf gloves even like earmuffs in my
bag so this size of fact is very very
practical but the reason I'm not too
sure about it is because I do also have
my Topshop teddy bear fur bag which I've
been wearing so much it's absolutely
gianormous and it's so cozy surprisingly
versatile and every time I take it out I
get loads of compliments on it I'll
insert again an overlay of that bag and
leave it link down below and but yeah
I'm not sure if I need this because I do
have that furry one but it's totally
different in style so let me know your
thoughts in the comments down below
okie dokie next up is river island they
are having an amazing season at the
moment and I am shopping they're far
more than I should do but let me show
you the bits and bobs that I picked up
in this latest haul there's actually not
too many so I should be able to whiz
through this first of all I picked up
these shoes now one of you guys actually
alerted me to these because I tweeted
out saying that a lot of you were asking
for dupes of my Gucci meals which are
also leopard print and one of you
actually found these and let me know
about them so I had to pick them up
because yes I do have the Gucci ones but
I want to wear the style a lot more
frequently and I don't want to
my Gucci ones out if that makes sense so
I picked up these they were 32 pounds so
I'm really really happy with how
affordable they were they're not the
kind of ponies skin and like a Gucci
ones are but they are almost like a
velvet material really really beautiful
and soft but then this buckle really
does look very similar to the Gucci
horse bit buckle so very good tubes
I always think river island shoes while
they're affordable they do look really
high-quality because they have some
really nice design details these ones in
particular have this gold bit at the end
of the heel which you will just be able
to see when you're wearing them and then
little gold studs here generally just
really well-made shoes and again a nice
a grippy rubber sole which the Gucci
ones actually don't have they're quite
slip-sliding so that's the first piece
if I pick it up from River Island the
second thing is another handbag this one
I thought was a really good shape and
I've been looking for a more boxy style
handbag for quite some time
and this one I thought would just go
really well with my wardrobe it's a very
versatile color looks actually really
great with cream so maybe this could be
a nice little combination but this one
again I thought was very much designer
inspired this buckle reminds me of I
want to say Sophie home but I'm not sure
if I might have made that up that was
probably the designer but also the Prada
box bags and the Louboutin box bags
definitely have this kind of vibe about
them should be a really good size for
fitting my everyday essentials and I
like the fact that it's got this little
touch of this Python style leather here
and then you've run over shoulder strap
which like a lot of designer bags do it
has a leather section in the middle so
you don't actually get chain marks on
your skin if you do have a bag that's
slightly too heavy so it's really nice
you can wear this across the body
leaving you hands-free and yeah it was a
really nice bag to add to my ultimate
collection so this is actually not for
me I actually already have this dress
and two of my friends have spotted it on
me and asked me to buy it for them as
well when I next put in a river island
order so I have done this is the jumper
dress you may have seen it on my
Instagram stories it had so many
questions but I absolutely am obsessed
with it this material is so soft it's
just the most cozy thing in the world on
your skin and then it has slightly
ballooning sleeves but they don't look
too Oh tea tea balloon style
they just are quite voluminous and then
they go into a tight to cover the bottom
its high neck which means you can get
away with wearing a thermal underneath
really warm and cozy and then a really
lovely length too what I also love about
this is the color surprise surprise it's
just my dream pink color very wearable
very flattering on all skin tones and
this dress looks fabulous with it
opening boots as well so for 40 pounds I
think this is a really fab piece that I
know I'm going to wear tons over the
autumn winter months I know my friends
will I'm sure you guys will I just need
to make sure that we have a Watts up
group so we don't all turn up for any on
the same day and then lastly and this is
a little bit of a wild card from River
Island I picked up some baby pink
corduroy trousers now I'm not sure what
these going to look like they could be
very unflattering and scary but I'm
hoping because they're nice and
high-waisted they should be a little bit
more flattering I don't know where this
obsession with corduroy has come from
I'm definitely blaming Julia for that
but I decided that I needed to try these
out they look like a really nice fit
corduroy is so warm if you're going on
any like winter trips if you're going
skiing these would be a really good
thing to take with you but I just really
was intrigued and wanted to try them out
so you guys will be seeing what they
look like now I'm praying that they look
good but let me know your opinions in
the comments below so that's everything
that I got from River Island and next
I'm going to whiz through a few of the
pieces I got from accessorize I went to
the Oxford Street store yesterday the
really big one that down more towards
Tottenham Court Road that one's my
favorite and I spotted these two bags
which I thought were really good dupes
now I know I had already ordered some
bags that you guys have just seen so let
me know which of the bags in this video
you think I should keep but these are
the bags that I got two from accessorize
I have been looking for more Chloe chips
recently and totally fell in love with
these two obviously this one is slightly
less of a dupe in fact I really like
that they're not trying to immediately
copy them but they just have very much
inspired design details if you've seen
the new Chloe bag I don't know what it's
called but it's almost like a tambourine
shape it's round and it's got like a
golden round handle coming off it that
just tells me that round bags are going
to be huge this season if Chloe you're
doing it then
sooner or later everyone else is going
to be doing it so I thought I'd hop in
on that trend quite soon and invest in
this little one here I say invest it was
25 pounds I'm very impressed with that
it's got a little pocket in the back
here good for oysters cards or anything
on those lines it's either got a pocket
on the front and it has this little kind
of money pouch section on the side here
to inside just one compartment with a
little zippy and Volokh section there
for any valuables and then it does have
a crossbody strap too which when worn
over the body looks like this I might
actually take this off it does come off
with a little clip but yeah I thought
this was a really nice way of adding
that Chloe vibe to your outfit at a
fraction of the price again I can tell
this is going to be so popular when I
wear it on Instagram that's so
definitely invest now because
accessorize don't tend to make thousands
and thousands every piece if it is on
the accessorize website again you'll
find a link to it down below in
accessorize I also picked up this bag
now you can't actually use this as a
handle like you can the Chloe bag but I
thought again very similar vibes I
really like the studs around here
definitely gives it more of a subtle bag
look if you don't even care about dupes
or bags that look like designer ones
these two are still really nice bags
which is what I absolutely love about
them but we do know that they are very
much inspired by those tote bags inside
this one is really spacious I love the
layout you've got this little pocket on
the front here big wide section and then
again a zippy section and a shoulder
strap too this one was 25 pounds as well
I think this is a really great versatile
bag for 25 pounds and I also picked up
the brown version which I'm actually
saving for a friend but I wanted to show
you both color options because when I
decided to keep for myself because I've
been getting so many questions for dupes
of micro in our bag which is in that
beautiful wine burgundy colors I thought
this was the best option available on a
high street and then we have some
accessories from accessorize now this
entire trip to accessorize was inspired
after meeting at Lila Parsons who is an
actress and TV presenter etc I met her
at a la mer foundation launch and she
was wearing the most beautiful jewelry I
asked her where it was from expecting it
to be some really expensive designer but
she said it was all from accessorized so
I went into the store immediately after
having that conversation with her and
picked up a few of the pieces she was
wearing and a few others as well once
again they have some really nice dupes
for brands such as Monika vinegar
I'll show you close-ups of them as we go
through but also from their Z or Z for
accessorize just some really stunning
very simple delicate pieces this is the
first ring that I got this looks really
nice we're in the middle finger I'm
going to insert close-ups of a bracelet
that I also got with a beautiful
diamante or cubic zirconia encrusted bar
around it again very Monica vinegar
vibes I would show you them while
talking but they're currently tangled
together with a necklace at the moment
the necklace again it's so sparkly so
delicate it looks far more expensive
than it was and it will see reminds me
of my Astra jamia necklaces with this
hanging that are just a really lovely
style especially if you're going to wear
v-necks this winter it's really nice to
have that additional design detail as
well as those two I picked up this
necklace this is a gain Z for
accessorized and it has got a
labradorite gem or stone in the bottom
there which again reminds me of Monica
vinegar and then cubic zirconia which
look like little diamonds around the
outside this one is just beautiful rose
gold chain as well very delicate very
feminine I'm saving the best to last by
the way so just keep on watching it this
little ring hole and this one at Z 4
accessorized cubic zirconia has a very
delicate little pink gem or stone the
MIL there that one I thought be really
great for layering this is the matching
ring for the labradorite I have to be
careful I'm saying that properly I just
want to talk about Labradors but yeah
this is the matching ring it to the
necklace I showed you with that
beautiful greeny stone and Rose plated
band and finally this is the one that
I'm most excited about it is again Z for
accessorized
rose gold plated cubic zirconia and how
much does this look like the Monica
Villa de Riva ring I wear my Reaver ring
90% of the time it's like my everyday
piece and this one was owned
fifteen pounds the Monica van der
obviously has diamonds in there I adore
it it's a beautiful investment piece and
have no regrets buying that one because
I wear it so much but this one is 15
pounds so if you love the Monica vinegar
you want that look but you don't want to
spend that amount then this one is just
absolutely stunning and so it's so
similar ok so last but not least I'm
going to go through a few pieces that I
picked up from that new look these are
really fabulous affordable pieces I
don't shop from new look as often as I
should but whenever I look in there I'm
always blown away by how many beautiful
pieces they've got obviously I've
already told you about this jumper which
I'm obsessed with it's just so cozy and
warm and snuggly but I also got some
lovely other bits and bobs I mentioned
this briefly earlier pick the socks I
just love the color I'm really looking
forward to seeing how this fits in fact
if it doesn't fit me perfectly I might
even alter it a little bit just so it
fits along the waist really really
perfectly quite a zip closure at the
back and then it slightly flares out at
the bottom it's got a hem that's been
cut at an angle so it should have a
beautiful floaty movement to it which
with ankle boots when you're strutting
along I think will just look absolutely
gorgeous love the sheen honest - this is
another piece that one of you guys let
me know about I mentioned in oh I can't
remote video it was one of the videos in
haul week but I showed you a gray suede
river island jacket a suede jacket it
was 120 pounds and one of you very
kindly let me know in the comments that
there was a dupe in new look so of
course I had to check it out I hadn't
taken the label out the river island one
yet so I've taken that one back and
replaced it with this one so this is not
suede it's that really soft material
it's not even trying to be suede but it
definitely has the exact same style
about it it's got an asymmetric zip
going across there it's not the buckled
silver detailing and it's that beautiful
just really soft snuggly material the
best thing about it is however it was
the price this was $39.99 so an absolute
fraction of the price of the river
island faux suede but you get the exact
same look another faux suede piece is
this jacket this one I wanted to wear
during Fashion Week but actually it was
too warm so I never did about the color
of this I think is beautiful it's like
this very warm camel
made straight down silhouette but then
you do have this waist felt because of
the material which is almost like a
velvety faux suede it's actually very
slippery so you have to tie this in a
knot in order for it to not keep coming
undone that's no big deal I'm fairly
lightweight so while it's still quite
muggy not really cold outside it's a
really nice weight for that kind of
temperature and again this was $44.99
but looks a whole lot more expensive
it's a really elegant length
it's very fashion blogger v so if you
want to rock those very stylish or most
fashion editor kind of look then I think
this is a really good one for that I'll
be starting this up a lot with jumper
dresses even jeans and the jumper
miniskirts maxi skirts yeah very very
versatile piece just whizzing it through
these last bits I picked up to faux
leather skirts I'm only going to keep
one I think I'm going to keep this one
it's again that beautiful oxford deep
wine color and then I also picked up
this one on the website I thought it was
more of a burnt orange shade a little
bit like this skirt but it's a little
bit too tomato red for my liking
they were $19.99 so I thought just a
fabulous way of buying into this trend
but without spending too much money
because I don't wear short skirts that
often but sometimes I just want to get
my legs out with high / knee boots I
thought that would look absolutely
beautiful just by being obsessed with
this beautiful burnt orange color I
decided to pick up this blouse this was
20 to 99 so really nice and affordable
I thought with white jeans or even the
trousers that I'm going to show you in a
second from mango this would look
beautiful again that Victoriana style
with the ruffle around the collar got a
lace detail and then a bib style here
and loads of autumn trends and then a
slight fluting to the sleeves so lots of
trend points from this affordable piece
when you look and then this one I picked
up almost as a dupe to my recent Karen
Millen blouse this one would be a really
lovely workwear piece is quite sheer so
you might need to put a little vest top
underneath but a pink blouse with
basically any kind of bottoms wear
that's a skirt high-waisted skirt again
white trousers or jeans I thought the
color of this one was absolutely
beautiful and again that the best thing
about it was the price
this was $12.99
I can't quite believe it and then
finally for a new look I've been looking
at for a faux fur juillet for quite a
while in this gray shade and this one is
absolutely perfect
this was $29.99 and it's got a really
nice effect to it it's almost like I
don't know how to describe it but it's
not just straight fur it's got almost
lines to it hopefully I'll show you or
maybe you can see from that but
hopefully I can show you in the close-up
this I think especially will go well
over jumper dresses where there's a gray
jumper dress or more of a camel color
the nice way of just adding a little bit
more warmth to the body without going
full-on winter style with a coat I am a
huge fan of G lace and for $29.99 you
just can't go wrong with this cover so I
said that was it but I forgot to show
you the mango pieces I only picked up
two bits from mango I went in there
looking for kata member actually got me
what I were in for but I saw this outfit
on a mannequin and I thought it looked
absolutely stunning in case you couldn't
tell I'm kind of obsessed with this
burnt orange color at the moment and I
think with white trousers it looks so
stylish so I picked up this combination
this was actually fairly expensive for
manga it was 50 pounds I think yeah
$49.99 because it is a hundred percent
silk so when you think of the material
it's not that bad value wise and I'm
definitely going to need to invest in a
new steamer because I do not trust
myself to iron silk but yeah I thought
this is a beautiful color with white
trousers such as these a look I'm
attached
it'll look absolutely beautiful these
are almost like a paper bag style at the
top where they really cinch in at the
waist these are incredibly high waisted
and then they are slightly tailored and
tapered down to a slightly more narrow
bottom keep a look out for me wearing
this outfit with maybe some little heels
maybe there's Topshop shoes that I
showed you away at the beginning of this
haul and yeah just a lovely autumn
outfit that I'm excited to try so there
you have it those are the new pieces
that I picked up from the high street so
many bits that I absolutely adore and
I'm very excited to wear and I really
feel like I've got a fabulous space for
my autumn wardrobe now so I hope you
