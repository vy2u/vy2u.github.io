me for today's video which is going to
be an autumnal get ready with me and I'm
going to sharing my everyday hair and
skin care and makeup what I've been
doing the past few weeks so it in that
really strange time of year at the
moment where we really want to embrace
autumn because summer has long gone and
yet it's still a little bit too warm to
really put all of those autumnal trends
to use into our wardrobe so for me a way
that I like to embrace autumn at this
time of year is by switching up my
makeup a little so some slightly deeper
shades slightly warmer tones and I
thought I would share with you how I've
been doing my makeup in a very chatty
relaxed vlog styles I hope you like the
format that I filmed this in let me know
if you do down the comments below
so without further ado let's get started
ok so fresh out the shower and the first
thing I'm going to do is my skincare
I've been using pretty much the same
routine for the past 3 or 4 weeks maybe
even longer and you've probably already
seen it in a few vlogs so the first
thing I'm using it's the Vichy mineral
at 89 and it's a daily booster you put
it on before your serum find it really
lovely and hydrating especially as we go
into the cooler months my skin's needs a
bit more hydration then I apply my eye
cream this is the origins a perfect
world in its SPF 20 and also anti aging
so just apply a tiny bit of that and
then very delicately Pat that around my
eye area and then I've been using this
non-stop the past like six months is the
dolphin at Lumiere essencial serum this
one is an oil in serum so it's got the
benefits of oil but without actually
applying an oil so it sinks in really
lovely and quickly but you still get the
luminosity and I've been using a pump of
that yeah for the past like six months
and absolutely love it maybe even longer
than six months actually been using it
pretty much ever since it came out big
big fan
and then the final skincare that I'm
doing before my makeup is my moisturizer
I'm using the Elemis dynamic resurfacing
day cream and SPF 30 I'm a huge huge fan
of the protoid and marine cream and but
this time of year I'm just doing
anything that I possibly can in order to
get and glow basically and because this
is a resurfacing day cream it just helps
to gradually
resurface the skin peeling very very
gently over time and it's got SPF 30 so
not only is it helping your skin to
regenerate balls you're protecting it so
I'm a huge fan of that I really feel
like 2017 has been the year that I've
really got to know and love LMS so that
and the pro-collagen moon cream are two
of my absolute favorites I like to leave
my moisturizer to sink in for about 10
minutes so it's at this point that I
usually go downstairs make a coffee and
also just get my hair to a point where
it's ready to start blow drying okay so
what I do to my hair straight after
getting out the shower hasn't really
changed in the past like two years so
this is pretty much what I do all the
time I'm just scrunching out any excess
water and then when my hair is soaking
wet I swear by this and I have done for
so so long I recommend it to everybody
especially people with colored blond
hair is the perfect full platinum
miracle filler treatment by Pierre ology
100% vegan ingredients for color-treated
hair I spritz this all over my hair it's
like a leave-in conditioner but it also
heat protects it detangles and honestly
I think I have this to thank for the
condition of my hair so huge fan of
goose and it's one of those pieces I
will forever repurchase once my hands
covered in that I will apply some
Moroccan oil to the ends of my hair my
mum got me into Moroccan oil many many
years ago I used the light formula and
it just helps to make my hair a lot more
manageable really so maybe three pumps
of the oil through the mid-to ends of my
hair this helps me to be able to comb
through stops any flyaways and just
generally helps with the condition of my
hair as well then I'm going to brush
through and I have this very snazzy hair
brush which my hairdresser gave me I get
my hair colored and done at Richard Ward
and he's developed this hair brush
called the tangle angel and it really is
very good I love that it's got a handle
I love that it's rose gold it's got like
angel wings and very very good at gently
detangling wet hair and then once it's
all brushed through I blow-dried to
about 50 or 60 percent dry before
carrying on with the rest of my makeup
my hair is semi blow-dried next back
onto the makeup and I'm putting on the
mi prima day long
skin Perfector this I find it's just a
really lovely base for my makeup just
give us a really nice like blank canvas
and makes my skin in a prime State for
applying foundation and for my base I'm
just running out some of my luminous
silk foundation from Giorgio Armani so
I'm currently blending it with the Estee
Lauder Double Wear I really really like
this the only thing that bugs me about
it is the way that it comes out so it
doesn't have a pump which means I
normally end up getting way too much on
my hands so maybe when this runs out I
might pour the Estee Lauder nude into
this because I much prefer how this
comes out but I do have a tiny bit left
of luminous silk and to blend that in
I'm using my damp Beauty Blender a brand
new one just for this video and always
use it damp just find it's the most
flawless way of applying my foundation
keeps it looking quite natural as well
for an everyday makeup look so hopefully
you can see that's given me just a
really lovely kind of natural dewy
makeup look and and that's how I would
normally leave it on an everyday basis
but because I'm actually going to film a
video after this one like a proper video
I'm going to put on my trusty Rimmel
match perfection this is my most loved
foundation probably ever and it's super
affordable just adore the coverage of
this and I always use it for filming so
I love the finish again I'm running out
so just putting some on the back of my
hand
dotting it on my face and blending so
that's given me a lot more coverage and
I'm much happier with that kind of
coverage for filming I'm also going to
highlight and brighten under my eyes
using the Bobbi Brown instant full cover
concealer this one is really good cuz it
doesn't go all and cakey or crease and a
really nice shade for under the eyes as
well
and once I'm finished with my base once
I'm happy with how it looks i'm using
the laura mercier this is the loose
finishing powder this one doesn't give
you a cakey effect at all especially if
you see with a fan brush and then I just
kind of brush this over set everything
down stop any excess shine and I like to
use a fan brush to apply this because it
just gives the lightest dusting of
coverage that should do the trick
next we're going to do brows and I'm
using the floor and I'll your brow
define this one is the shade light I'm
gonna use the dark end of it to first
just create that shape underneath at the
brow so you want to make sure your brow
is starting in line with your nose so
you can kind of make a little point and
then to see where the arch of your brow
should be looking straight in the mirror
and then creating a line again there so
it should be around there and then where
your eye ends again line up your nose
it's where your brow should end that's a
rough guideline to creating your brow
shape and then using those three markers
it's just kind of join the dots and
creating that shape okay feeling a lot
more human now that I've got my brows
done before I move on I'm going to pop
on a little bit of lip balm this is the
coadley French kiss in the shade
seduction I just really like the texture
of this one and it makes a really nice
base for future lipstick as well and
then I'm going to add some color to my
complexion using the BT Liberata crystal
bronzer this one is bronzer slush
pressed powder but what I love about it
is actually works through your makeup to
tan your skin and if like me you just
will do anything to keep up that lovely
bronzed glow during autumn and this is a
really lovely one plus it's a gorgeous
shade as well and then for those areas
that I want to be even more bronzed and
glowy I'm using my trusty hourglass
ambient lighting bronzer which again I
have been using for well over a year now
yet to find anything that I love more
than this if you guys also love this and
have found some alternatives please let
me know because I'm dying to try
something else next up is eyeshadow and
I don't know any beauty bloggers this
autumn that's not going to be
using the Urban Decay Naked heat the
colors in here just so so perfect I'm a
big fan of the match ones down there
surprise surprise I actually really
liked using the brush that it comes with
I'm going to start by using chaser as
the one that I apply all over the lid
just realized I forgot to set my brows
I'm using the Elizabeth Arden statement
brow this is just a very soft brow gel
doesn't like lock them in place but it
definitely adds a bit of hold and it's
got a little bit of color in there too
so I'm just gonna brush that through the
brows and then back to eyeshadow I'm
going to use low blow which is this one
here and for that I'm going to apply
that into the crease that's had a bit
more definition and then instead of
using an eyeliner which I always find is
too harsh I'm taking a really precise
brush this is the zoeva
winged liner brush and I'm going to use
he devil and I'm just going to really
closely pack this as close as I can it
to my eye lashes which should help to
just define the eyes without the
boldness and just harshness of an
eyeliner
I'm not sure if you can see that too
well on camera but it really has just
helped to define my eyes a little bit
but with that really lovely warm brown
or terminal shade and I really like that
for an everyday makeup look it's still
quite soft but adds a little bit more
drama and I'm going to use this brush
which is a really lovely one from ICONic
really pretty brush and just to blend
everything together to give it a totally
seamless and soft finish as you guys
know I like to keep it quite natural on
my eyes I don't ever really do anything
too crazy with my makeup for my mascara
I'm using the l'oreal paradise ecstatic
mascara this one has got castor oil in
there which is really nourishing for the
lashes i just had individual lash
extensions so i really do need to keep
my lashes nice and nourished to help
them recover this is a black mascara i'm
hoping they might bring it out in brown
if you guys again have any really nice
drugstore brown mascara recommendations
please let me know so i am much more of
a fan of brown mascara in autumn ok so
that's my eyes pretty much done next i'm
going to add a little bit of color to my
cheeks and you've probably seen me using
this palette as my mirror I love this
ginormous mirror in this it's the it
cosmetics you will most beautiful you
anti-aging anti-aging matte bronzer
radiance Luminizer and brightening blush
I actually don't use the bronzer that
much for no particular reason other than
I just guess I'm obsessed in my
hourglass but I love this combination
here another iconic brush I just love
the color of these it got like a taupe
bristle end and then rose gold and cream
definitely my colors blending these two
and a really soft application give a
little bit of color to the cheeks and
then I'll normally finish by going in
just with the highlight for a very soft
highlight and glow on the lips I'm going
to be using the Victoria Beckham Estee
Lauder lipliner and this is in the shade
oh one Victoria it is the most perfect
brownie pink shade and I'm absolutely in
love with it so I'm gonna start by
lining the lips with this
so you can see that's just really help
to define the lip shape which is really
good if you're using a slightly softer
lip stick now on an everyday level I
normally wouldn't wear a proper lip
stick but what I do adore these new lip
gelatos from Elizabeth Arden you may
have seen the lookbook that I did
featuring these I'll leave it linked on
the screen now and down below and just
absolutely love them beautiful
consistency very barmy so really nice
this time of year I would normally wear
this on an everyday basis but as I am
filming later I'm going to use a
slightly more pigmented lipstick this is
the Elizabeth Arden that was scary that
was my bedroom door slamming I'm going
to be using sorry slight destruction
with the dogs but as I was saying for a
slightly more coverage look on the lips
for filming today I'm using the pure
color Envy from Estee Lauder in the
shade insatiable ivory this is also
quite barmy but the most beautiful color
and I find that one just works really
beautifully with the Victoria Beckham
lip liner as well so that's a real go-to
combination at the moment and one that I
always fling in my handbag for just you
know topping up on the coat I'm going to
add a little bit more drama to my lashes
as well and this is the grand entrance
mascara from Elizabeth Arden another
longtime favourite of mine I absolutely
love this one and used it from probably
at least a year non-stop and it recently
came back into my life which I'm very
grateful so I'm going to add a second
coating of mascara with this one just to
add a little more drama and my final
step is a finishing mist I am using the
Too Faced hangover 3 in one setting
spray this is setting spray priming
spray and moisture spray I tend to use
it most as a setting spray so you
actually have another favorite for
topping up on the go it's this one the
Elizabeth Arden 8 hour miracle hydrating
mist this is one that I just use
throughout the day you know and you just
want a little pick-me-up
so I'll just miss this on whenever I
want
bit of a hydration hit but for finishing
off my makeup the two-faced one is my
favorites I'll finish with the misting
of this that's my everyday autumn makeup
I'm going to leave my hair to dry for a
few more minutes it's a little bit damp
in the under sections and then I will
show you how I just loosely and softly
curl my hair for an everyday kind of
look ok I'm back and I have now totally
blow-dried my hair it's absolutely dry
and as you can see a little bit of a
draggled looking so I'm going to brush
through it and then I'm going to show
you how I do my everyday loose waves
using my PhD platinum stylist these are
not just any platinum stylist these I
was so kindly given at a DHD event
recently and they have got fashion month
which is my blog name written on them so
big big THANK YOU to GHD and yeah I'm
gonna use those switch those on super
quick to heat up by the time I brush my
hair they'll be ready to go and then my
super quick technique for creating my
curls is just taking a fairly small
section of hair smoothing it out and
then I just glide the stylist down the
hair and twisting at the end there we go
nice little curl and I don't brush them
out until they've cooled down because it
just helps to like such the style in
place my roots need doing so badly and
by the way I actually have a blog post
all about my thoughts on getting my hair
bleached because don't think I've ever
really spoken about it on my youtube
channel before but something I really
regret so if you've ever thought about
getting a full head of bleach or you're
wondering about my hair then I'll leave
that blog post link down below because
it's quite a lot of things I learnt from
getting my hair bleached so definitely
check that out as you can see I just
have really really bad roots all the
time and that's because essentially
bleach is like plasting a colour
plastering a colour all over your hair
and there's no easy or subtle way for
regrowth so yeah check that blog post
out so as I get towards the back of my
head I'm making the sections slightly
bigger which in turn makes the
cause a bit bigger focusing on the end I
always just kind of twist them as they
drop and again this helps to helps the
curl hold its form and then when I reach
the middle I'm not very skilled when it
comes to doing the second half so I tend
to do my lipstick last because what I'm
gonna do is put a lot of my hair in my
mouth to hold it out the way I still
need to learn that alternative way of
doing it now that my hair is curled I
can reapply my lipstick and then the
look is always complete so I'm gonna
give my curls a very very fine misting
of the GHD final fix hairspray and then
I'll just run my hands through to give
them a little bit more of a soft and
natural look so there we go
obviously every single day my curls look
different sometimes I'll brush through
them sometimes I'll add a bit more
volume on the roots just depends on what
kind of hair day I'm having today
they're looking quite good quite
voluminous down there so that's pretty
much my entire makeup and hair routine
that I'm doing on a daily basis and I'll
probably switch it up make it a little
bit darker as we go even further into
autumn but that's what I am currently
doing so I hope you guys enjoyed this
