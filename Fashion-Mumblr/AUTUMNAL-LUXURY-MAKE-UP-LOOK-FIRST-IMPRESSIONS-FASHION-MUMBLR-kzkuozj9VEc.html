look I'm going to creating in today's
video and to do so I'm using a whole
load of brand new luxury beauty products
and I'll be sharing my first impressions
of them first of all after cleansing I'm
using the origins ginseng hydrating
cream moisturizer you've most likely
seen or tried the gel version but this
is a little more rich and creamy for the
colder months it still gives that really
beautiful radiant glow and has the
revitalizing effects that we know and
love from the ginseng range then because
I'm all about that glow I'm trying out
the Sicily instant glow primer I really
love the 4-wheeler of this and it felt
very moisturizing and plumping on the
skin and the little went a long way
which is a relief when it's almost 60
pound for this little tube just letting
my hair dry a little and then it's on to
the base layer of my makeup and I'm
starting with this stick foundation from
Lancome now I don't usually like the
texture of most stick foundations for
all over I find them a little bit too
thick so I just using like concealers
applying on the chin any areas of
redness under the eyes and I'm putting
some around my brows too as I recently
had them waxed and there's still a
little bit of redness I must say I was
very impressed with the comfort and
long-lasting finish of this base product
throughout the day before I do anything
else I'm moisturizing my lips with
Clinic's pepper start out perfecting
balm and essential if you're going to
our lipstick and want to have hydrated
lips all day I'm a big fan of this one
and my lips felt thoroughly conditioned
next for foundation I'm trying out the
Lancome teint Idole a ultra wear and I'm
applying with this dreamy is numb our
foundation brush this foundation comes
in lots of shades
I may have one that's actually a touch
too light I'm using a kind of stippling
motion to apply I found this to be
incredibly long-lasting and it provided
great coverage without feeling cakey at
all but I have to say there are more
affordable foundations I do prefer the
finish off like Rimmel match perfection
I finished by blending it perfectly with
a damp Beauty Blender I often find that
this helps a base to just glow a
then the palette that Instagram dreams
are made of the hourglass ambient
lighting palette edits number three I'm
just obsessed with the hell glass
powders they add such a beautiful
radiance to the skin and here I'm using
diffused light which is a beautiful
pearl toned finishing powder to set my
base focusing on areas such as the chin
under the eyes and then I'm sweeping a
mixture of that and dim light which is
slightly more peachy toned all over the
face oh yes and love that glow just when
I thought I could not love another
beauty product anywhere near as much I
tried lemare's the bronzing powder wow
oh wow just look at it and there is my
camera this was just something else it's
65 pounds which actually I was
pleasantly surprised at with lemare you
can be talking hundreds if not thousands
of pounds for a product actually I don't
know if there are thousands but anyway
and for me this was worth it look at
that sunkissed glow the color the payoff
was just perfection and so much radiance
love I then filled in my brows with the
Ilia Fleur de force brown fine which I
love is a really great affordable brow
pencil great for creating the thin hair
like strokes and then I set my brows in
place with benefits gimme brow which I
just wiggle a little bit through the
brows to give a little bit more volume
then I used Bobbi Brown's evening glow
palette I love the actual palette with
this beautiful kind of textured compact
and for 35 pounds I think it's actually
a pretty good value when you get five
very wearable shades I use the lightest
right up to the brow bone and then this
shimmering champagne color just on the
lid itself using the brush that comes
with the palette I'm then using the grey
brown shade right up close to my lash
line to create a bold but still nice
soft everyday look back to hourglass I'm
reusing my fan brush to use the blush
from this palette so
palate is 80 pounds if you've already
got a bronzer blush and powder for an
hourglass then I'd say you don't need it
but it is a beautiful thing to have
maybe one for the Christmas wish list so
I'm using a tissue to blot the excess
balm from my lips before trying out this
new launch from Clarins
it's a full-color pen 28 pounds and the
retractable tips include three colors of
the eyes black brown and blue and then a
mutual pinky brown for the lips and it's
specifically designed to stop the color
from running I found it very very
comfortable smooth easy to apply and
that's probably thanks to the jojoba
sunflower and black acacia waxes in
formula I finish off using this on the
eyes of the little bit of the brown
color also very very comfortable and
smoother to apply then I tried out a new
lipstick from Asha Sado in fact I think
this is the first makeup I've ever tried
from the brand
it's the Rouge Rouge lipstick in matte
shades of rose quartz and this color is
beautifully intense and the finish is
like a velvety matte as for the color I
am in love obsessed just love oh my gosh
so Barbie feeling but such a beautiful
color this shade
we definitely have a new favorite folks
next for mascara I tried out the dolce
gabbana passion on is waterproof mascara
a very sleek gold tube and I really like
this stiff bristled brush which made it
super easy to coat and comb the lashes
now this is 28 pounds which is a lot for
mascara especially when I was some great
drugstore ones but I did really like it
I love the curl and the volume it gave
to my lashes no flaking throughout the
day super long lasting but also very
easy to remove all round it was a winner
so this was my finished look a glowing a
radiant and feminine look but wait there
I came back after breakfast so I brushed
my teeth I decided to try a deeper lip
this time some lip products from YSL I'm
lining the lips with the Desson deliver
liner and wow this was so creamy really
velvety and rich no driving on the lips
at all and again
formula is designed to prevent your lip
color from running I then finished with
wire cells tattoo our culture liquid
lipstick and Wow such an intense color
and yet it didn't feel dry or cakey like
literally every other matte lipstick
I've tried we may have a new autumn
favorite here so this really is the
finished look for the day I hope you
enjoyed the video darlings and I'll see
you next time please subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
