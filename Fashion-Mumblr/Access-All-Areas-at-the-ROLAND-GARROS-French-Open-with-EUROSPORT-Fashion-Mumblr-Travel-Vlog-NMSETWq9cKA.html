vlog so today I'm in Paris and I'm here
something really really exciting which I
think you guys would have seen on my
Instagram stories yesterday I'm
basically here to Holland and galas
Tennis Championships which I'm so
excited about i'm here with Eurosport
and you guys are going to see loads of
exciting things that we're doing it
tomorrow so I landed today from Bordeaux
that a flight directly from Bordeaux
where I was for the last couple of days
my first time being in Paris on my own
obviously I'm going to be with the guys
tomorrow but today this afternoon I'm
just called here exploring the city by
myself which is quite exciting I'm using
City Martha heading currently to the
river going to make my way towards the
Eiffel Tower I don't have time to walk
all the way there and I think I'm going
to try and plug a random stranger
hopefully take a photo from me this is
first royal problems but yeah we're
going to give that a go so I thought I'd
bring you guys along with me and yeah
that's how confront
okay so that was a fairly eventful 15
minutes I just found this really
photogenic bridge and I decided to kind
of hang around with my camera and see if
there was anybody that didn't have some
fishes that would take a photo of me and
while I was hanging around good
underneath this bridge I suddenly felt
all these drops on my back and yes you
guessed it it was a flock of pigeons all
taking a you-know-what at the same time
so yes my brand-new white jumpsuit is
now green
I don't know if you can see that and
then a Spanish couple came up to me and
offered me some baby wipes which was
very handy that she had baby wipes in
her bag and the guy was like trying to
clean my bag but at one point I thought
he was trying to rob me so then I was
like no no no and then I think I
offended him because it was trying to
help me so yeah I still have birds all
over me but I hadn't been robbed which
is great and then i saw another blogger
taking some photos by the bridge so I
asked a photographer very politely if
they wouldn't mind taking some snap for
me so hopefully we got the charts but
got about another 15 minutes until I
need to introduce I'm going to try and
take some more just in case but looks
like we're in a really nice place so
hopefully I've got to grab someone and
get a few more just a backup shot
hopefully no more go to ok this is kind
of brilliant so because I'm here by
myself I'm finding myself really people
watching and then if you recognize where
I am here kind of the main walk up the
Eiffel Tower where everybody gets those
all-important key chain scam photos
myself included but there are so many
people here literally just trying to get
that perfect shot for example there's a
girl behind me you pretty well got to
see but she has bought a bunch of helium
balloons and she's currently chosen by
the carousel there's a lady who writes
me with a big bunch of EMU
I feel like everyone is very inspired by
ocotal or trying to get that one
important shot so I'm going to head up
the terrace where I got a lovely rosey
last time try and pray on an innocent
tourists including a few more bozos so
this is this tragic or really
independent can't quite make up my mind
okay so I'm back in the hotel room now
I'm going to have a really quick
turnaround because I'm meeting everyone
to go out for dinner in about ten
minutes but first of all I'm just going
to show you the state of my hair and my
jumpsuit so I don't know if you can tell
it's all sticky so this is all bad - all
in man yeah you can see a little bit of
green and then my jumpsuit you can see
over my shoulder
oops yeah giant burger - so that is the
current state of affairs I'm going to
really quickly change my outfit of
course top up my makeup very very
quickly give my hair brush and try and
get this to out somehow and then meet
the guys down so this is the full extent
of the bird poo pretty extreme I better
have some serious good look after this
okay so we've come to the tennis courts
this morning and we're going to be
having a tennis master class put on by
Eurosport not going to lie I'm probably
going to make a massive you-know-what
out of myself because I haven't played
tennis since I think I was probably a
nine at school so at least ten years ago
then even then I was fairly rubbish so
yeah this could be a little bit
embarrassing I'm going to try my hardest
this could be a bit like you've been
framed
so I'll film as much as I can and but
yeah if anyone can teach me how to play
hopefully it's the pros so let's give it
a go
passport knows no return maybe on the
summer night
shall L m and struggle not to breathe
sort of line and month I'm bad relaxed
right I'll leave I will leave it on the
lips indeed I do believe come on
let's rather train come on
is change
now I miss the nine-to-five don't hear
it in my song I'm all sold my way don't
get me wrong brand new start and a
homing part there we go she spills I'll
be there on that slap on baby no
the rabbit
none
and run to life
Oh Olaf either fold in autonomous and
ghosting
blazing open
they take you home
you
oh come on
Ravin
so as you guys can see I think it's safe
to say I will not be giving out the day
job anytime soon becoming programs
they're so much fun that I think we
learnt the basic forehand backhand
serving and then we did a little target
practice challenge which we lost but hey
ho it's the taking part that counts so
now we are heading back to the hotel I'm
going to put on some different clothing
and I think we're going to head to the
match so it off the court now and we're
analyzing our performances and I had a
little wristband on while I was playing
and planked it up to an app bubble up up
and apparently my maximum hit was at 93
kilometers an hour which I'm pretty
tough road and let's see how many
forehands and backhands I did
62 for hands 28 backhands 111 shots and
18 subs not bad for my first attempt is
to learn medical illness thank you
okay so after a quick change after our
tenants mark smiles back at hotels we've
now come to the village within the
tenants ground they'll also clear behind
me I hear a lot of the brands of
sponsoring of cortical areas the way of
course are going to be with Europe are
going to have some lunch in their own
area
kosher good thought long jeans and were
at everybody peers we're going to go
inside now got some food and then in
Times Washington
all right so we don't come out of a Q&amp;amp;A
that you're exhausted with some working
world corrected she was talking with
John McEnroe Boris Becker Lindsey Vonn
these are all world champions Olympic
gold medal winners so the most
incredible experience and we're being
told about some of the new technology
the euros for developing all about
really tracking the exactly roll so it's
kind of surreal being here rubbing
shoulders with sort of these incredible
links very inspiring very very good at
media I think now we're going to have
some newcomers who knows he was caught
next so we have just taken our team
ready for the women semi-finals
what do you think rusty so these are
great tips right almost upfront almost
ethical yeah because that interview with
the television in guys just right in
front of us yeah are you happy we
believe Michael Pento
three-day spirited Algonquin one pero ha
ha ha ha sleeve a a controversy say
wisdom canal network Lloyd algorithm
basically tiny scars in color in Spanish
Amma summer professional summer
you
all right so we are back in Europe
brought little area and finish packing
the change that was a pretty hot and
intense not much I don't know how the
players do it into your kind of
temperature we were all out some melting
I'm really good match
I've never been so close to a tennis
match like that before in fact this is
my first proper and it's March I've
never been to Wimbledon I neither
professional games Falls and we just
have the best feet so incredible
experience we're going to hang around
here for a little bit longer now and
then I think we're going to get a little
backstage tour of where Europe hang out
during the match so we're building goes
on and how they edit the CV that to be
really really interesting
good yogurt mom where'd you get them
and pretty cool out so when you guys see
the challenges going on live on the
Eurosport channel this is exactly where
they are filmed you can see behind me
all cameras are lighting up here this is
what they see when they're being filmed
during the challenges the game set be
met and yeah pretty cool to see this and
on the other side we've got caught not
about you what a reason there would be
that he has a mother
I
so this is one heck company production
going on here right within this building
is where I think there are about 200
euros for employees and they're blasting
the south of 60 countries seven
different languages and for each of the
languages that have spoken
so each of the languages there is a
different production team so French
Spanish English German so it's a massive
massive operation where your export been
doing this for the past 20 years here at
the French Open so it's pretty much a
smooth operation that room that I just
took you into entitles the Commissioner
that's where they do a kind of comedy
sketch and the sketch they were filming
this morning will be going live tomorrow
so I be asked to name and say I've been
there it was pretty cool so now I think
I've got to sadly head to the Eurostar
the traffic in Paris pretty bad today
the rest of the guys are going to watch
another match but I'm heading out but it
has been one heck of a memorable
experience so thank you your thoughts
for inviting me Allah send me
