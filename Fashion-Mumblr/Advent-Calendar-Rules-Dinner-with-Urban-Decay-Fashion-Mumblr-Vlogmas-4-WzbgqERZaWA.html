day well that's before I think is I
think it's a lot nice day for I don't
know but um I'm afraid it's the
afternoon I had not a lazy morning we're
just um sitting in my Stephen bag I'm
not camping Oh true startup morning guys
and welcome to vlogmas day 3 no way I'm
thankful I don't know I mean for the
number up here someone it's one o'clock
in the afternoon I have had quite a
chilled morning I've been really
productive but I didn't really get out
of my dressing gown until about an hour
ago because I was just like video
editing an email editing and there's
only so much of that stuff that you guys
come watching vlog so I decided not
start filming until I'd made the face up
so I've got quite a em a festive look
going on right now cuz I've just been
filming a couple of videos I was really
late to the party with my November
favorites but I've just filmed that um
and then good old youtuber tricks I just
stuck on a different jumper stuck on a
different lipstick and then I filmed can
you guess
from the bomb site yes I filmed a
Primark haul which is quite a fun one
it's the festive one um so yeah I'm
sorry if you guys to see that I will
probably publish it next Wednesday so
check out that one when it goes live
so maybe sooner who knows see how fine
and yeah this lip color is actually an
Elizabeth Arden plum shade with YSL
babydoll this one here what color is a
number 4 nice and performative name that
yeah so I'd laid off a couple of
lipsticks and I quite like this it's
quite a nice read but not being too
crazy these are one of my Primark
purchases
Dexter keeps looking at them mmm cheeky
monkey
and he wants to shred them mountain boy
so yeah quite a productive morning I'm
heading out this afternoon meeting a
couple of the girl
I think we are gonna go to a couple of
shops there's some store launches and
then there's a dinner going on later on
a nice festive dinner don't know what
I'm gonna wear yet I'm gonna head out in
a second
to my P o box start all down the road
and and see if my I saw sliver has come
because I'm like wearing one of my new
dresses tonight so yeah I'm gonna target
this bomb site and get crackin so I'm
just gonna wrap up the first giveaway
winners prize which was the idea I think
there so congrats to Clara who won that
but first I'm gonna open up a new advent
calendar so when I went for my hair
treatment yesterday um the girls from
Kara stars gave me a cur stars a pink
Panda and yeah we have a tree Charlie
got it while I was out yesterday I text
him when I was at another tube station I
think I have them here and I was like
please can you blog you going to get it
so I can put it in the vlog but he did
it on his phone that way up so the
footage was just absolutely am useless
so need to teach the boyfriend how to
vlog yeah we have a tree but we're gonna
decorate it tomorrow so I'll do a whole
like tree decorating fun video tomorrow
but yes I have this absolutely huge and
parrot stars I think condor and cuz it's
December 3rd I'm gonna open 3 which is
gonna be really exciting on my lips so
big let's have a little a little look so
where is number 1 I have where the hell
is number 1 not that so let's have a
look much easier to open on the
accessorize one and easier to remove so
what's this we have so we have the
sublime sublime cleansing oil shampoo
such a cute little dinky size it's
really good so I've never actually tried
Kerastase hair products before so this
is gonna be good way of me figuring out
which is good for my hair so that's day
number one pop it over there so number
two threes up there I wasn't over to
this little one up here you now see this
is this is the elixir K Cole team I'm
guessing
Alex your old team washout mask so I
guess this is going to be like a deep
conditioning mask so look forward to
having a little play with that one and
then three it's this big one up here
focus what have we got here
looks like we pretty much got a full set
of the gold ones now and this one is a
beautifying oil cream I like the sound
of that maybe it's like a blow dry bond
so yeah a nice little collection of them
goodies my first story from the Cara
Stars calendar and I already opened my
other actually now I only open the
chocolate ones so let's have a little
look at the accessorize one as well I
also made up a rule that if Charlie
forgets to eat his calendar chocolate
one day then I get to eat it and he
didn't eat number two so I had his
number two and my number three today and
from accessorize we have a lovely purple
shade I had to use my scissors to hack
into it but yeah nice another little
nail punch from accessorize now I'm
going to pack up the earlier advent
calendar ready to head down to the post
office so I feel a bit crap at vlogging
today but then you don't really missed
that much I've just been doing stuff on
my computer at editing emailing and just
that kind of stuff so don't worry don't
miss out on too much it's about half for
now although living outside you probably
think it was like 3 o'clock in the
morning so dark and as you can see I've
got changed
really hot breath yeah I've got changed
and I'm wearing this top which I
actually forgot I had just found in the
loft and it's a gray cashmere top does
that make the light better nope that
makes it like worse
so yeah this is gray cashmere top like
tank top kind of style from whistles I
got it last year but my lovely Swarovski
Miranda Kerr necklace on little i-car
Vella watch my Governator necklace and
black myself rich suede skirt and these
are the Giger boots that I'd go gray and
gray
although the Grays are two completely
different shades that never mind and
today's giveaway is another lovely
selection of product so you've got a
little bracelet from pretty little thing
concealer palette from freedom this is a
notebook from a brand called nuna and a
batiste styling spray a little balmy
cube lip balm and the peaceful
resistance these are oh this is a set of
the daily muss from and seminar this is
a Spanish brand and absolute obsess the
product if you don't read my blog you
may not know that but they are
absolutely gorgeous and in here you've
got cream mask exfoliating mask a
mineral mask and a gel mask so really
good way of trying out some of their
amazing face masks and I think I might
run today's giveaway on Instagram so

some instructions in the little comment
box down below because I actually
decided how I'm gonna do it yet and the
I have a little look down below to see
what I'd like you to do on Instagram in
order to win those lovely pieces I'm
heading out now I'm a little bit late as
per bloody always I never think I'm
gonna take so long to get ready and then
I take like three times longer I was
gonna go to the post office haven't had
time to do that so yeah gonna head out
now
we just arrived taxes by Park Lane and
I'm not going to have creepy issues you
can
I'm
why is it getting harder to buy address
coasters I don't know why the graphics
and things are numbered
just got home from the Urban Decay
lovely time it's just like the perfect
group of fellows that have really really
lovely evening and of course the Gwen
Stefani color is just so beautiful so I
can't wait to have a little play with
that in the morning go on in our goodie
bag so yeah really excited to play with
that but you know what I have become
such a granny recently like it's only
ten o'clock but I feel like I have been
out all night and I feel really hardcore
and you know what I just want to take
our makeup off and get into bed so um
it's pretty much what I'm gonna do but
Charlie's not here he's still out so I'm
going to treat Dexter to coming into our
bed tonight and Charlie doesn't allow it
but um you know what he's not here so
I'm gonna take Dexter up and we're gonna
have a little bit of a snuggle session
so I'm in bed now with my little boy
he's always been very tired and I think
I'm just gonna stick on a little bit
youtube watch some videos I'm gonna
catch up on some other people's vlog
misses because I haven't actually
watched anybody else's yet this year and
I know I've got tons to catch up on
someone's very tired so I really hope
today's vlog hasn't been incredibly
boring I feel like I didn't really do it
that much um in the vlog today so I was
super production this morning but I
wasn't really vlogging so if it has been
incredibly boring I'm really sorry but I
will make it up to you tomorrow because
I've got loads of fun things on and yeah

short vlog and I'll see you in the next
