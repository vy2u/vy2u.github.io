video yesterday and but that wasn't
actually December so I guess it was
cheating a little bit just because I
wanted to have a video up on the first
day of December but it is the first of
December today and I'm gonna start my
proper daily vlogging which I'm a little
bit nervous about never done a proper
daily vlogging before so wish me luck
I've seen quite a few nervous tweets
this morning and vloggers wishing each
other luck for vlogmas so that's them
kind of made me a little bit more
nervous but you know we'll just see how
it goes today as I might be able to
guess by the hair tied up and comfy
outfit it's working from home this
morning which is always good fun to
watch um but then I've got a few really
fun things on this afternoon got my
Christmas jumper on it says express your
elf this is from Dorothy Perkins and it
is quite nice quite plain nothing like
too crazy about it let's got a cute
little Santa bubble down here which I
love and sparkly so first things first
we're going to open up advent calendars
me and Charlie and food darling first
things first me and try and open our
advent calendars we've both got Dairy
Milk ones and I've got this one from
accessorized as well I gave away loads
of event calendars I kept this one
because it's now vanish and you can't
pose now chocolate the breakfast for me
we need to remember whose it is what an
earth is that I think it's like a
monster or something I have no idea what
that is oh my god this is really hard to
open how are you supposed to get in this
this is absolute nightmare
ah no way neech order that's so cute
I can't get it out Charlie's gonna have
to help me get the design floor from the
accessorize you know I wanted to come
wrong come on so after demolishing the
number one I finally managed to get out
the nail varnish such pretty packaging
you've got this rose gold lid and it's
kind of not sure how to describe this
but very pretty bottle in a baby pink
color very nice gonna look cute when I
have 24 of those anything about
chocolate advent calendars they always
leave me craving chocolate I could do
with a dairy milk bar right now but I
thought I'd tell you quickly about what
I did yesterday she had quite fun
festive day first of all I went to
Primark and I bought loads of like
Christmassy Primark things I think I
might film a haul later although I'm
having a really bad hair day so maybe
maybe I found that on Friday and then I
went to Selfridges because
build-your-own Birchbox is back and I
made up a little box so I'll quickly
show you what's inside basically you can
go into the I think it's got like the
urban oven something area of Selfridges
and you can pick all the bits you want
to fill your Birchbox with so I got a
philip kingsley dry shampoo which i've
not tried before the Elemis pro-collagen
oxy generating night cream I really like
the pro-collagen marina
day cream so yeah thought I'd get the
night cream version tried that out then
I got the this works sleep plus pillow
spray absolutely love that stuff mean
choice right on our pillows every night
and I thought that's a nice little
travel version then a little benefit for
professional and this is like an
absolutely tiny sample but really good
for the travel bag
I've got a nail varnish from a brand
called sign not sure how you pronounce
that but I actually had way too many now
honest
already I thought we'd give that one to
monks it's a very nice color for her and
finally I got the Laura Mercier amber
vanilla souffle body cream because I
could smell this in the tester and it
was literally the most amazing smell in
the whole world so picked up those
pieces and and then I went to Deb nose
and that's really annoying me that this
is open and I went to debenhams and
picked up some pieces from there so I
got the Chanel vitae Lumiere aqua and
fresh and hydrating cream compact which
again my mom actually has this and I
always pinch it and I go to her house so
I thought I'd treat myself to one it's
in this little pot and I think it's
really good before and keeping in your
handbag makeup bag so you've got a cream
foundation under there a little sponge
and a mirror as well and it gives quite
good coverage Essene and went in the
middle of the day when your foundation
might have melted off I thought it'd be
good for that yes you coming up they can
see inside it's like this pot of cream
foundation then you keep it safe um with
that keep it clean and sponge so yeah
nice little compact from Chanel and it
comes with a little velcro not velcro
velvet pouch as well so you don't get
scratches from your makeup bag I'll pop
that in there and then I got a new
current instant light lip Perfector in
the kind of brownie color I actually
have one of these in my drawer
it's one of these but in the more
brownie color which I don't think I have
right there I absolutely love them I
know my mom really likes a brown color
so that's a nice little stocking filler
for her hopefully she's not watching
this already showed to her presence and
then I got a couple of things from Urban
Decay I got a new lip liner absolutely
love their lip liners and I saw a
slightly darker shades when I finally
got this is I think this one is called I
think the shade is called 1993 but it's
this kind of dark pinky Brown which I
thought it's rather lovely
and I also got
you eyebrow pencil because I can tell
that my one's gonna run out really soon
so yeah and that'll beauty haul from
Debenhams
and then after that my friend Meggie who
is my best friend from primary school
who lives in Australia and her fiance
Tom and gorgeous little baby Ella
we all went to sketch down on conduit
streets I knew how they really loved the
afternoon tea in their pink restaurant
it's all as I can underground art
gallery if you haven't heard of sketch
before it's a really really cool place
in London for afternoon tea so you went
there we had some cakes and sandwiches
and tea and her really lovely often in
there before heading to winter
wonderland which was really really good
fun we're on a few rides and we tried
the shooting game none of us were very
good at it Charlie tried the hanging
from the bar thing but didn't want that
either yeah that was really good fun so
yeah that was yesterday quite festive
day and before I talk any more
the light is so bad in December so I
literally have to get my filming done
first thing otherwise it doesn't get
done so right now I need to film the
intro for vlogmas you guys haven't
already seen it it will have hopefully
been on this vlog and yesterday's vlog I
need to make it right now so I can edit
the vlog that you saw yesterday
god it's like a time warp and so I'm
going to use this which a mom got me for
my birthday
it's from on the high street and it's a
build-your-own light box so I'm not sure
what I'm gonna make it say maybe like
welcome to vlogmas or twelve days of
local nice I don't really know yeah I'm
gonna put this together now and film my
intro had to go across the road to get
some batteries I also got some chocolate
that I was craving from the advent
calendar although I went for an arrow
this is one of the Matthew Williamson
design ones but it is really good so I
have that when I finished setting this
up as a little treat
all right so I'm just finished filming
my intro bits you guys already know how
it looks I'm just gonna go and edit it
now but to give you a little sneak peek
this is what the setup looks like so I
don't have work floorboards anywhere in
my house I'd leave I do have this
massive bit of vinyl I think it's called
yeah I bought a massive Star Wars so
that's what the background of my photos
are and then over here I've got bomb
site of all the different letters from
the kit they've got like a pastel set
and a Christmas set as well so they're
really cute yes I'm gonna go and edit
them now let Dexter out of his cage he's
looking a little bit grumpy in there
because I had to look him away to kept
shredding everything I was trying to do
yeah it's time for editing
so somehow managed to let the whole
afternoon disappear again it's three
o'clock now I've just been sitting on my
computer editing and writing and doing
emails and suddenly it's getting dark
outside like I'm not used to this crazy
December weather but yes I've just had a
productive afternoon and I got the intro

earlier I've got a couple of events
tonight need to sort my makeup and my
hair my hair is just really really bad
recently I've been using a few different
shampoos and conditioners and you know
sometimes they just kind of stay in your
hair that's exactly what's happening so
it's a little bit gross
see I'm gonna try and do what I can with
my hair probably end up doing an updo
and I'm gonna put something quite
sparkly on it's a German own Christmas
party tonight
okay so I've done what I can with my
hair and makeup which isn't very much
I've had to do a ponytail but I don't
think it looks too bad just a little bit
flat on top a usually flat on top but
you know we'll just give it a bit of a
give it a bit of a push
I've got on my ILO false eyelashes from
the Hollywood blonde set which I love
this is an Estee Lauder one of their lip
stains got the new urban decay thing I
was talking about this morning on my
brows and my stealer from M&amp;amp;S palette on
the eyes for a little bit of shimmer and
oh and the Charlotte Tilbury color
chameleon in bronze
outfit-wise I have gone for a black role
neck top you can see it's just like a
quite a light not one of those really
heavy wooden ones on the top and then a
fuzzy layer which I completely forgot
that I owned I lent it to my friend
Vicky last new year I think and she was
like Jessie I have your jacket so I got
this back recently and I've been wearing
it to death ever since this is my French
Connection skirt which I got to wear on
my birthday and I'll write again tonight
this is a few Christmassy events going
on my Mulberry Cecily handbag it's
pretty much my smartest black handbags I
thought I'd take that out and then my
rust on Brahmi High Line's Dexter is
trying to attack some of my other shoes
no a little beasty so I've got three
events tonight on least I'm going to try
and go to three events and so yeah wish
me luck
a little bit about the fragrances
yeah I've just chosen
table
my scandalous right sweetie
so I've just got home and reunited with
my little boy I went to
so I went to a trek America God he
always you and somebody have a tradition
I went to a trek America event after the
gem alone one with the lovely Hannah and
it was really good fun we just learnt a
lot about the Traxxas are doing next
year and it's really given me the travel
bug I desperately yes to go they look so
incredible
see I definitely gonna look into that
but it was really dark and I don't read
log and then I just got the bus home so
nothing too exciting to report back home
November boy so I think we're just gonna
have something for mommy and Dexter
cuddles might give myself that of a
pamper tonight to use a nice cleansing
balm and maybe stick a face mask on my
skin is fitting a little bit dry so this
is the bathroom cupboard
I'm gonna use my usual origins mega
mushroom relief my cell water to get rid
of the bulk of the makeup and then I
think tonight I'm gonna try my blue and
then I'm going to use this which is the
Elizabeth Arden cleansing oil which I
really like Mondays and I want a bit
more of a pamper
so then I've got my little tray of
pampering bits and bobs all by side I'm
a bear to these different than I creams
are years think tonight I'm going to go
for the dolphin purifying balm this is
kind of a cross between balm and an oil
and I really love that one
this lipsticks a bit dry it's the
Clarins hydro quench and then this is my
favorite eye cream at the moments
yesterday Lauder advanced night repair
really good for puffiness of the eyes my
under eye areas bit dehydrates at the
moment so nice to stick a load of that
on so this is a really thick consistency
it's kind of definitely it's really hard
to describe this texture it's like stiff
Vaseline I guess you could say then I'm
gonna get a bit like this and my fingers
excuse my nails so in case if it goes
off I will say goodnight and thank you
