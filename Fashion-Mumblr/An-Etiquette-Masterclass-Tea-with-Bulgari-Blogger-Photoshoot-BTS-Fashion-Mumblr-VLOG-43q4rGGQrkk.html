throughout November as well I've got
some troubles coming up and it's my
birthday month so yeah let me know if
you'd like to see a few more vlogs in
November cause I'm feel like I'm in the
swing of it now I'm here with the lovely
cats don't them like looking for you
everywhere and we're creating some
really lovely videos and photos together
cat is a video maker and photographer
extraordinaire and we have found the
most amazing location yeah it's so
beautiful this mansion look behind us oh
we're just pretending we live here and
yeah it's just so amazing so I'll show
you behind the scenes of a blog a photo
shoot we've both got like suitcases with
us although of clothes makeup different
handbags different shoes so this is what
goes on behind the scenes when there's a
blog photoshoot I've got like tons of
different outfits I've got hair spray
jewelry makeup yeah so I'm trundling
that all around town with us today
but the shots are looking really really
beautiful because well it is absolutely
gorgeous so yes that's the plan this
morning and I'm going to take you with
me to an afternoon tea later on today as
well so should be nice from that day
forth
so this is what goes on behind the
scenes without fit changes I'm gonna
remove my coop myself it okay it's a
couple of hours later and cat and I have
had an incredibly productive morning we
have got so many shots I think we've
done how many would you say like six
outfit changes yeah so many and look how
beautiful this place is I'm just about
to do an Instagram for this autumn
wonderland it's so so so beautiful got
so many nice shots so I want to come
here for every photo shoot so we're
gonna hop in an uber now and go
somewhere a little bit more central I
want to get a few indoor shots so trying
to think of somewhere that we won't get
kicked out by taking a load of photos
because people are strict
time for a little catch-up so I have
left cats now and made my way to the
vulgar East where everyone sweet where
we just had our our community and it was
so so beautiful
ladies actual visa
a blogger
all about her passion for jewelry and
what so special about Bulgari jewelry
which I can see behind me and I may or
may not have left with a sneaky treat so
I will show you this as soon as I get
home very very exciting now I'm going to
meet my friend morning guys sorry I
didn't finish my vlog properly yesterday
I just got home from the afternoon tea
as you know I didn't go straight home I
went out with my friend Vicky we
described a coffee and a little bit of
shopping together in hmmm home and Zahra
so yeah I didn't vlog because I just had
so many things in my hands I had my
suitcase from the photo shoots and then
yeah it just loads notes of bits and
bobs so the afternoon tea at Bulgari was
absolutely beautiful I learned so much
about the brand obviously the brand is
all about jewelry so we got to see the
serpentine collection up close which is
just stunning like doing beautiful
jewelry I think I've ever felt in my
hands it was just absolutely gorgeous
and the afternoon tea was just to
introduce us to the news spring/summer
17 collection and I cannot believe I'm
saying this but look what I left with I
actually think this is the most
beautiful bag I have seen in my entire
life it's it's snake print all over and
then you've got the beautiful serpent II
clasp in the middle it's the perfect
size for just wearing with your outfit
like I am doing today it's a crossover
bag and yeah
I just I just have no words it's so
stunning so let me show you what I'm
wearing to the 8 before I head out okay
so the lighting is not the best for an
outfit of the day but I've got my coast
cape on again got a puppy yesterday it's
puppy day soon so make sure you've got
your puppies show support of those who
fought for us in the war and lost their
lives and then of course I've got my
beautiful Belle gar bag so penty I will
leave all the information about this
down below as with the rest of my outfit
links and then this dress I feel like
it's really appropriate for what I'm
doing today it's a the sleeves are like
kind of 3/4 sleeves and it's just a very
smart dress from phase 8 absolutely love
it and then I'm wearing my mango boots
which you see me wearing about a million
times so quite a smart outfit of the day
so the plan of action today we're
basically heading to Claridge's first
thing
morning which is just the most beautiful
place and it always reminds me of when I
worked at Marbury because that's all we
used to host our fashion shows so it's
going to be really lovely going back
there and this morning there is an
etiquette to the master class with
Birchbox to celebrate their november box
and with Tattler magazine i'm really
really excited to learn about some
etiquette rules and hopefully I will
learn some new things which I can share
with you guys so it's gonna be a really
fun day and then I'm getting my hair
colored because as you can see I need it
and then I'm going out for a dinner with
Jacques vas so really fun day and let's
get going
oh yeah it's half on the back
yeah
hello again so I've just left Claridge's
I couldn't really vlog too much in there
because it was just a very intimate
event so it would've been a little bit
strange but we had a lady called Joe
Bryant who is an etiquette specialist
and she was actually fascinating learned
so much about just you know lost British
etiquette how to be well mannered how to
be the perfect dinner gasps and what to
do in lots of social situations so I am
100% definitely going to be doing a blog
post on this or maybe even a video so
keep a lookout for that and it was all
to celebrate the November Birchbox which
is in collaboration with tabla and it's
about quarter to three now and I'm
getting my hair colored out so soon now
so I will see you guys in the
hairdresser
okay excuse how my face looks I always
feel like I look better but I'm so
pleased with my hair it's a beautiful
actually blond color now and the two
guys that did my coloring card did such
fabulous jobs we did that Instagram down
below that they're both from Sassoon on
South Molton Street so back then so the
colorist put in some really fine
highlights so it just looks really
really natural you can barely tell that
I've had my hair colored and hopefully
the regrowth Ruby too bad and the cut
looks great as well it's just so squishy
so very very pleased with my hair now
I'm heading to me and those hotel
Olympos treats for dinner with let me
just show you let me show you this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
