youtube channel today's video is going
to be an evening of indulgence and my
hotel pamper routine for me this time of
year is super busy so an evening like
this is really all about taking a step
back from a busy day and relaxing and
treating myself and this evenings pamper
routine is inspired by the luxurious
Palmolive gourmet body butter shower
creme collection which includes
chocolate passion strawberry touch and
vanilla pleasure tonight I'm going to be
using a strawberry touch body wash which
contains strawberry extract for an
incredibly fruity gourmet shower
experience after a busy day exploring
Amsterdam I returned to my beautiful
hotel room ready for an evening of
relaxation the first thing I do is head
over to the bed and of course check my
emails just to make sure that there's
nothing outstanding and nothing urgent
I find that I can't fully switch or
relax unless I know that there's nothing
urgent that I need to get done so I tie
up any loose ends before finishing off
for the evening
next I went to change out of my jeans
jumper and shoes that I've been wearing
all day into something a little bit more
comfortable I'm reaching for the robe
that was in the hotel room and I slip
this on before starting my pants routine
I step into the bathroom where the first
thing I do is get my hair all out of my
face I don't want to be getting any
products in there so I sweep it all up
using a hairdressers clip then I'm
cleansing my face I'm just using a face
wipe to get rid of all my makeup before
moving in with a creamy cleanser I
massage this into my face before moving
with a woman wet flannel
next I'm going to apply a clay face mask
these are really good at drawing out any
impurities from the skin the one I've
got here is actually just a test of
sachet which I picked up from our
magazine I always hang on to these
because they are so good for popping in
your travel makeup bag so I'm applying
this especially over my t-zone but all
over my face and then I head back into
the bedroom and the evening of
indulgence really begins inspired by the
pollen of strawberry touch this
evening's theme is very much pink
strawberries and luxury so I'm treating
myself to a few strawberries from the
mini bar before deciding which Netflix
series I'm going to watch while my face
mask sets I decide to indulge myself
even further with some lovely champagne
tonight is all about indulgence so why
not then it's into the bathroom when my
luxurious shower routine begins
I'm using the Palmolive gourmet body
butter shower cream to create
multi-sensorial of shower experience its
ultimate shower treat for body and mind
the scent is so heavenly and it even
includes natural ingredients the rich
creamy formula really leaves my skin
feeling velvety soft and I defends my
whole body with it enjoying every moment
I leave the shower feeling as I've just
left thus far but my evening of
indulgence doesn't end that the next
thing that I do is reach for a sheet
mask and once again these are really
great for traveling says so port for
they don't lay anything and then don't
use up your liquid allowance I'm
applying this one to my face to add
instant hydration although I do look a
little bit scary no laptop this time I
head back into the bedroom and grab a
magazine just to read for 10 for 15
minutes or so while my skin absorbs the
hydration from the mask then I slowly
peel it off looking a bit more normal
again before pressing the remaining
ingredients into my skin for ultimate
hydration then I pamper myself further
with a lovely body lotion all over the
body and then I use a facial brush to
really massage invigorating circulation
of my things finally I apply a facial
oil just to complete my pamper routine
then it's back into the bedroom where I
miss the room with a sleep spray to help
me drift off for me the ultimate luxury
of a pamper evening is an early night so
it's not long before I'm back into bed
and ready to drift off I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video and I'll see you
next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
