YouTube video I have been thinking about
doing this for a little while
it's one of my news resolutions and it
feels really weird just sitting talking
to the camera but I'm sure I'll get used
to that thought long and hard about what
I wanted to do my first video on and I
thought I'd just do something that I
write about on the blog a lot something
that you guys seem to like on the blog
so today's video is my April favorites
favorites is a really fun thing for me
to do I really enjoy doing my favorites
because I basically just scurry around
the house around my dressing room and
pick up all the pieces that I've been
loving over the past few months this
month there's a few things that are
repeats some things which you will know
that I'm gonna be talking about if
you've read my blog because I have
written some really really like rave
reviews this month anyway I'm gonna stop
rambling on to my favorites if you read
my blog you will have seen this coming
because I actually wrote a review and I
think I sent out a tweet saying guys I'm
giving up beauty blogging and I'm not
giving on Peter blogging obviously but I
just love this cleanser so much that I
never want to try another cleanser ever
again like it's so good my friends a few
of my friends that are not like Beauty
obsessed they love it and they swear by
it and they're like it's the only
friends I've ever used even to the point
where they will bring this huge like
it's as big as my face they'll bring
this to my house and I've got a lot of
cleanses that they can borrow it but
they still bring this and they're
buffing cloth which I swear they iron
because mine look like crinkled bags now
that I've washed him a few times anyway
I thought I had to try this and I was
really kind of given this bottle and now
I couldn't so see why everyone's
obsessed with it oh I don't think I said
what it was it's Liz I'll cleanse and
push it's amazing
while we're talking about Liz oh they
had an amazing launch at the home yard
hotel last week or maybe two weeks ago
to lunch or relaunch their hair care so
they had had her a few years ago before
I knew much about the brand and
everybody loved it but then apparently
one of the ingredients one of the old
ingredients became extinct
I couldn't find it anymore so they took
the range off the shelves all the little
fans were like oh yeah bring it back
yeah so they spent ages trying to find a
new ingredient and actually one of the
botanists from the Nissel team was at
the event and they said that they found
a new ingredient which is ah it's the
Kalahari jewel well that was the hashtag
but
Kalahari melon oil that's the secret
ingredient so that is what makes your
hair super shiny and like the cleanse
and polish they just have one shampoo
which is meant to be like universal for
every hair type and then they have three
different conditioners so I've gone for
the one from normal hair and my hairs
are a little bit dry the ends um colored
of his teeth I wish it was like this
naturally actually it's kind of brown so
comfy long for normal hair smells
amazing
um I describe it like it is kind of
Melanie but not like overboard Melanie
but I really noticed the difference when
I use this it makes my hair soft and
light and I used it yesterday and I
think my head looks quite shiny and my
head never looks shiny so that's a good
thing and then actually the whole Liz L
skin care routine so I did the cleanse
and polish and then the toner I use our
exfoliator every now and then but also
this moisturizer so this is the skin
repair moisturizer from normal to
combination skin I don't use it every
day but on some days I just want to do
like the whole routine so cleanser toner
I staff and then this and my skin just
seems to drink it in and I think that's
a sign that the cleanse is really good
because if your skin is clean then it
will absorb everything and yeah it's
been absorbing this I know I've never
had compliments before like your skin
looks good but I've had a few
compliments this past week and I just
think Mexicans not looking too bad
Julie I love sure like so I am NOT like
obsessed with natural Brown what I like
I dropped it the other day actually my
boyfriend dropped it um and now okay it
works okay I'm just gonna show it like
this because the top keeps coming off so
this is the gel eek someone's at the
door
it was my neighbor and she bought
muffins cinnamon and banana love it when
that happens
where was I this is agile ich herbal
recovery advanced I serum and I've been
using it for maybe three weeks now and I
have really noticed a lack of I whenever
anyone says what's a skincare concerned
I'm always like I bags if you ever look
at pictures of me that are not edited I
have double eye bags it's in a bag
within a bag and I've just not been
noticing it so badly since using the
Cilic advanced ICM I don't I don't know
what the magic ingredient is and I don't
know if it's just this or if it's
combination of me being healthier in
general but I am willing to carry on
exactly what I'm doing for the sake of
my eye bags or lack thereof so this is
really good next up is this bad boy this
is the bare minerals complexion rescue
tinted hydrating gel cream and this was
actually I think the first bare minerals
approach I ever tried and I'm completely
converted I think at this time of year I
just oh I used to be obsessed with UM
the Rimmel 25 our lasting finished
foundation and so when I got this I
thought okay it's really light based
it's not gonna be enough but actually is
and with the whole this other thing my
skin's been quite good recently and so
this although it's not full full full
coverage it's more than enough what I
love I need right now I'm wearing it
today and it's kind of glowy but not
shiny although I have got bare minerals
matte powder over the top for filming
because when I started filming I was
like blow blow blow blow
um TMI back to this it's got some
ingredients in it I don't know which
they are but it's got some ingredients
which are good for your skin so I think
if you keep on using it then your skin's
gonna get better and then you need less
makeup so just all over which I'm not
amazingness it says to apply it with
fingertips but I just I don't really
like applying stuff with fingertips and
I just prefer buffing stuff in I don't
like getting my hands dirty
I got some white so and on my handbags
as well I just don't want to get makeup
on them so I apply it with these so Ava
1:02 soap finish brush I love this brush
I use it for like most of my foundations
I also have the Sephora airbrush I'm not
sure the number but if I want more of a
coverage I'll use Sephora but right now
these two together amazing lipstick lips
- from Charlotte Tilbury which again is
a new brand discovery for me this month
and already the loving loving loving it
I actually know that's a lie my mom got
me pillow talk for Christmas it was on
my wish list for my birthday but I
didn't get it for my birthday which is
November and so I asked mum for it for
Christmas and it's beautiful and it just
is very similar to my natural lip color
maybe a little bit more dusky pink so if
I want to just line my lips or color my
lips in with it it's a really beautiful
shade I'm not sure if you can see I
don't really know how to focus this
thing that that's the color and I used
it around the edges today but then I
filled it in with this which is sexy
Sienna and it's a beautiful kind of
coral it's coral but not as bright
orange as most corals it's just a really
really pretty color and that's what I'm
wearing right now and I just think it's
I love this I think it's gonna last me a
long time because I've been wearing it
everyday for the past two weeks and
we've still got like it doesn't really
look like I've used it so hopefully this
will be sticking around for a while
they're not the exact same color but I
like to line my lips someone actually
asked me the other day if I'd had my
lips tattooed and I was like no
Charlotte oh bin liner so give this a
try if you love liner if you can't
afford this I think
I think it's Rimmel um I think it's
called the lips exaggerated not sure
I'll find out they have something really
similar which I also love and I think
it's probably not as expensive as this
but if you can afford this or you want
to try it out then do it and it's really
big so I think like you can just sharpen
it and I'm sure I'll do a video like a
few months Norway down here so I think
it's not too but I think it's 16 pounds
so that's good
I shall talk about highest few things
I've been loving and these nothing
smells so good ice okay um I've been
loving eye crayons recently I never
really tried them before but I've been
trying to condense my makeup bag to put
things in my little makeup bag it's not
a little it's like that big the four
things that I take to the gem and this
has made the cut because it's so easy
you don't need a brush and a shadow pot
it's from Elizabeth Arden and it's the
sunkissed pearls creme eyeshadow stylo
in freshwater pearl so in spring I don't
usually wear eyeliner I go for lips
instead and I like to keep my eyeshadow
quite like fresh so this is a really
lovely can you see that I've got a
picture so just look on my Instagram or
something it's kind of a very pale pink
slightly shimmery but I'm like not for
glittery eyes so it's not fishy at all
it's just got a bit of a blow um I put
it on today and then I put on the
Crown's which I'm gonna talk about in a
second it's just really easy to apply
you basically scribble it over your lids
and you can blend it in with your
fingers or you can blend it in with a
brush this is probably the wrong one
this is a soft definer but it's really
beautiful just yeah I really like it the
Clarins it's rose gold my brush is rose
gold this is rose gold rose gold rose
gold rose gold
I never zakat and so soon as I saw this
on the table I was like oh I have to be
mine it anyway it is the ombre
iridescent I blog about the omron
a while ago and said how much I love
them how much they last forever and I
again have been using this one every day
for the past three weeks and it doesn't
even look like it's been touched I think
this is gonna be one of those that just
lasts so long it's really beautiful it's
a light pink color and it just gives
kind of shiny but not too shiny
glow of my toilet it's just basically
stunning so love this from Kearns and
the packaging I buy it just for the
pictures you know Instagram I just
realized I showed you these these are
tweezerman um rose gold eyelash cutters
this I think was in my last month's
favorites it's the benefit roller lash
mascara I'm really really liking this I
have the mini one from Elle in my gym
bag and I have this on my dressing table
at home it's got um I think you probably
have all heard about this by now but I
really like it it's pretty
it gives me really separated lashes and
I don't even find that I have to curl my
lashes in fact I forgot to curl these
lashes and I culled these ones and I
commonly notice not much for difference
because I think this has little grippy
things like on hair rollers um that
separates and curls and unlike cheaper
mascaras I just find that even for hours
later it still looks good
it hasn't they haven't like flopped so
so I had loved Bobby Brown before but I
haven't bought any in quite a long time
my Bobbi Brown bronzer had just run out
so I was pretty much Bobby Brown this
and then yeah oh yeah I was lucky enough
to go to a bar with brown makeup master
class in their common garden store and
they used so many beautiful products on
me showed me like the best way to apply
the product
Renato he was such a babe he showed me
some completely new ways to do my eye
makeup I haven't actually done it today
because it was more of a like evening
look but um I will do another video it
may be on that but anyway so the product
that's in my favorites is that blush
trio now I was obsessed with mister on
the hourglass ambient lighting blush and
basically like cleared away all my other
blushes because I couldn't find anything
that I loved as much as that but then
this little one came on the scene and I
really really like it it's got three
really pretty shapes it's got like
they're all kind of warm toned dusky
pink this is a very like dusky peachy no
it's not eg it's really pretty kind of
Barbie girl pink this is a more intense
kind of future we pink and then there's
got some flex of wish on it so what I
usually do is I use a sort of camera
that like a faux pas um this one I tend
to apply like down that general area and
then I apply the middle one over the top
as a life a little bit of highlighting
with my mega old Bobby Brown blusher
brush I say my gold it's literally like
four years old and it just looks almost
brand new and it feels brand new I just
use like normal soap as well to clean it
so it's not like I've used some mega
fancy stuff anyway this is beautiful and
it has made me not be so obsessed with
my hourglass ambient lighting powder
which if you follow my blog for the past
few months you'll know that I was so
obsessed so that's amazing that it's
taken over this little cutie this is a
miniature of the Chloe fragrance I think
it's C original it just says puff homes
Chloe so I'm just gonna say that it's
original it's a beautiful fragrance one
of my friends Sophie boom the amazing
hair she I think it's hot at was this is
her everyday fragrance Suns just come
out I hope I hope the Lighting's okay
I've done this before so don't really
know um it's just so cute I think I'm
gonna see this on basically every single
Instagram image for the rest of my life
because it's so dinky the ribbon just
fell off let me just so cute
so yeah love that that smell I love it's
cute love it's pink love it I think
that's everything but before I go there
is one more thing which is in my
favorites picture I finished on my
Instagram
loads those people have commented on how
peaceful it is I think it's the most
beautiful thing in the whole world right
now
Irie huh no no yeah actually beautiful
beautiful beautiful handbag from Rebecca
Minkoff I saw it first on the American
bloggers website her name is Jessie and
her blog is the darling detail as soon
as I saw it on her site I just knew it
had to mine so I went ahead and I
ordered it it went in sales so that kind
of sealed the deal but I just love it
it's really tiny but still manages to
fit in all my my camera and my makeup
bag just about so it's really beautiful
apologies for hacking up your Instagram
feed with just tons and tons of pictures
of it but I just can't get enough
because it's so beautiful so that's it
