favorites video for me this is a really
special video to film because I realized
the other day that actually my very
first youtube video was my April
favorites last year and that actually
blows my mind a little bit because
whenever anybody says to me oh how long
have you been doing YouTube I always say
all six months eight months but it's
been a year and that is actually quite
ridiculous but it's really nice to see
how things have changed over a year and
yeah I can't quite believe that the year
has gone by it's actually very scary if
you do want a good giggle then I'll
leave a link to my very first April
favorites down below but it's fairly
embarrassing so maybe maybe just don't
do that so if you follow me on snapchat
or you just watched my YouTube channel
then you'll probably know that for about
80% of this month I have been traveling
I've been in South Africa which was one
of the greatest holidays that I've ever
been on China I went away for 15 days
kudos to Charlie because he organized 90
percent of that holiday we stayed in the
most beautiful hotels we ate at the most
incredible restaurants so a lot of my
favorites are things that I either did
in South Africa or that I took with me
or bought along the way so there's gonna
be a slight running theme along the
whole South Africa lines for this video
something that is completely unrelated
to South Africa aside from the fact that
I took it with me though is my very
first favorite and it is this beauty
right over here so I shouldn't really
feel the need to justify this but I'm
going to anyway this is a Valentina
handbag it was quite a splurge for me
and I know I do whole videos all the
times I feel like such a ding about
saying this but I really don't actually
buy that much my last designer handbag
that I purchased was a mulberry Cecily
bag the one is acutally it with the book
with the Daisy and then it has a
scalloped edge I think it's called a
Cecily bag but I purchased that using my
staff discount when I worked at Mulberry
two years ago and that was my last
designer handbag
purchase so I felt that the time had
come to treat myself again and I've been
looking at this one for quite a long
time I kept walking past in Selfridges
after having meetings there I just love
these colors you guys know that I love
my pinks my corals especially this time
of year and my rose gold and to me
Valentino is actually quite a special
brand because my very first ever
designer purchase was my Valentino
Roxton shoes which I still love to death
and I don't think how to feature them in
a favorites video but I do wear them as
awful lot if you follow me on snapchat
you're probably bored to death of my
view from above but they were a very
special purchased I Coutu myself to for
my graduation and this of course is the
same brand it has the rock stones as
well so it goes with my shoes
beautifully and I absolutely love it it
was pricey and I'll leave a link below
if you want to see how much it was and I
just think it's worth every penny it's
gonna be this kind of bags that I use
year after year after year I did buy
this bag as a treat to myself I haven't
really splurged as I said in quite a
long time and yeah I just thought it's
about time that I spent a little bit of
money on myself and I'm just so so glad
I did absolutely love this bag and
you're gonna be seeing a lot of this
over the coming months so I apologize in
advance for upcoming the bag spam my
next favorite is very much a South
Africa related and it is this I'm busy
hat now I wore this so much while I was
out there got so many comments from
people in the hotel lot on the beach and
to be honest it just summed up my whole
time in South Africa I just really
wanted to switch off from the world have
a bit of a digital detox I did a little
bit of work in the mornings just so that
I wasn't stressed and worrying about
emails during the day and then I set my
out of office which was so blissful and
told the world I'm busy which is what
this hat says on it and I actually
purchased this hat after seeing one says
wish you were here or going offline one
of maybe both on Rosie Londoners
Instagram I looked at that hat and I
believe it was around the 300 pound mark
from I want to say to me hope
but it's not it's a brand that I've not
heard of before on net border but close
to 300 pounds which is out of my budget
when it comes to summer hats so I sold
this one for I think 18 or 20 pounds and
I snapped it up in an instant absolutely
love it and I'll be taking this on my
upcoming trips next I have a perfume and
this is actually only been in my life
for about a week now and it's a round
called keen reserve which I've never
ever heard of before
and the fragrance is called sweded suit
which sounds like a grammatical error in
my opinion I don't think weighted is
actually a word but I yeah I had not
heard of this brand before so I wasn't
really expecting to be so impacted by it
but that very first spray I knew I was
in love as going to wearing this for the
rest of spring/summer and probably for
the rest of the year it's a I'm gonna
attempt to explain what this smells like
though we all know that I'm not very
good at that it's a very woody
Doody kind of 140 type fragrance it's
very familiar and warming if you really
like those kinda it's not floral in the
slightest
I do love florals but it's not floral
it's not sweet it is very warm very
relaxing musky just absolutely gorgeous
so if you like things like just as kind
of spicy us Arabic foodie fragrances
then you'll absolutely love this I'm
obsessed with it the packaging is
gorgeous very sleek in a squirrel's
bottle with wooden lid I just love
everything about this along similar
lines also kind of a fragrance is this
and this is the Estee Lauder bronze
goddess shimmering body oil spray now I
use this on an everyday basis whereas in
South Africa in the afternoons when it's
kind of sunset cocktail time and also in
the evenings so what this is is a body
spray which has little particles of
glitter in it but not like tacky cuz
exciters kind of erisa but more very
subtle just tiny tiny flecks of glitter
that just given love
glow to the skin and it also has the
smell of bronze goddess so it just made
my limbs look really shiny and shiny on
holiday and also has that gorgeous scent
and I took this one in particular
because of the really dinky bottle size
this one is doesn't actually say how
many Millett is but it's definitely
under hundred mil so if I was going away
for the weekend which I'm actually doing
in a few weeks I'm going away for just a
couple of nights I will definitely be
able to take this in my hands I did
which is a bonus next a few beauty items
and this one really really took me by
surprise this is the new NARS Laguna
bronzer in the liquid form and if you
watch any of my makeup tutorials you
know that I'm not that familiar with
liquid bronzers liquid flushes I just
prefer powder I'm just a powder kind of
girl but I actually watched Alex from I
covet feet doing a first impressions of
this I'll leave her video down below
because that's what really inspired me
to try this out in a different way to
what I had originally planned so what I
have discovered that I can do with this
and the way that I fall in love with it
is actually by mixing it in with my
foundations so as I got a little tiny
bit of a tan in South Africa a few of my
foundations were getting too pale for me
so what I did to darken them was just
add a couple of drops of this in which
took the shade down or up whichever way
think about it a few levels and it made
my foundation a perfect match I have
also been using this as its intended as
a bronzer using my zoeva 102 silk finish
brush and its really good for being
quite selective with your bronzer so if
you want to give a really natural
sunkissed look on the top of your
forehead I used it a little bit today on
my cheekbones and this is the one and it
is of course that beautiful looking the
shade which we all know and love I don't
actually have too many makeup favorites
this month because when I package for
South Africa I took things that I
already knew that I loved so I wasn't
trying out too much but one thing which
I discovered at the beginning of the
month and immediately made its way into
my travel makeup bag of these two new
lipsticks from Burberry and I believe
they're called the full kisses
yes Burberry cool kisses and I have the
shade nude and the shade English Rose
both of which are just absolutely
stunning colors and incredibly easy to
wear the nude has become like everyday
color but what I love about these are
they're so moisturizing don't get me
wrong I still love my Tom Ford first
time that's what I'm wearing today but
it is quite matte so on those days when
my lips just can't deal with the matte
lipstick I put these on this so
hydrating and the color I'll do some
close-ups now of the colors of these so
stunning so comfortable to wear and I'd
say about six hours of beautiful color
and comfortable wear on my lips
next up is a product which I have used
twice this month and it has become an
emergency SOS product for my hair so I'm
really not sure if you can tell color
wise on this camera but I actually use
this last night and it has become an
absolute savior for those days all times
when my hair is just starting to go a
little bit yellowy or coppery so as you
guys might know I do color my hair my
natural color is a lot darker than this
blonde and regular coloring means that
my hair conditioners it's not bad at all
but it's definitely not as good as it
could be and also after maybe three or
four weeks after my colouring
appointment my hair does tend to go
quite golden quite Capri which I really
don't like I prefer much more almost
white almost gray ashy blonde and this
has become the product that I rely on
for getting that color back in between
appointment to the hairdresser and it's
the e salon devoted to hue color
enhancing mask and it's called the
blonde neutralizer
it says reduces warm tones enhances
vibrancy and shine and conditions and
hydrates I have to say other masks that
I have do conditioned and hydrate more
than this so I do use other masks as
well but when it comes to stripping out
any kind of warm any kind of yellow or
orange or copper in my hair this is the
one it's bright bright bright purple and
I have to say I do use an awful lot of
it at a time this is only two uses so I
think I'll probably get maximum four
uses out of this but having said that I
do have a lot of hair and I do plaster
it on because when I want something to
work I just put loads on
I hope that I'll make it work quicker
maybe next time I'll try using a smaller
amount to let you know if it still works
just as much because it could be quite
an expensive habit but this works so
well if you are concerned about your
plant echo and Capri and I highly
recommend this a few final things that
are both completely unrelated to each
other in any way at all
second-to-last is built on there so if
anybody has been to South Africa you
will know that biltong is just a way of
life out of there or a part of life I
should say is so yummy unless you're a
vegetarian if you don't know what
biltong is it's basically okay I really
hope I don't get this wrong it's beef
which has been air-dried
and then they add different spices and
herbs to it to give it the most amazing
taste in the entire world and this one
is boresville flavor I have no idea what
it means but we have had already another
packet of this and it is delicious if
you're a meat lover if you like things
like salami dried meats and you would
love biltong so my diet over the past
two weeks has consisted 90% of biltong
and I freaking love this stuff in fact
if anyone's going to South Africa and
can bring me back someone please let me
know because this ain't gonna last long
and absolutely last products I promise
and it is this coat from Zara I will
show you a clip with me wearing it
because I appreciate that me showing it
to you here is really not going to do
the trick but this is such a good
example of how a last-minute real
impulse purchase just proved to be such
a good one because I actually picked
this up in the airport on the way to
South Africa I was wearing a leather
jacket to travel just wanted something a
little bit more comfortable saw this in
Zara and I was like that is so mean that
is
thing that are we're all spring and
summer it's a very lightweight fabric
but it does have a lining so it gives a
really lovely shape in the structure
it's quite a boxy silhouette it doesn't
really have any kind of muscle word
waistline and it does have little
pockets as well it's got beautiful
frayed sleeves this almost kind of
Tweedy material which could be a little
bit Chanel II and it's beige which means
it goes with 99% of my wardrobe although
I wanna clear doesn't go with what I'm
wearing today because I'm wearing white
and grain beige and white not really the
one but this was I think 69 pounds but I
didn't pay the v80 because I got it in
the airport and I wore it so much in
South Africa it was a little bit cooler
in the evenings I was then I thought it
would be so this was just so handy and
it just looked absolutely beautiful with
all my outfits and with my Valentino
handbag which is the most important
thing so that is everything those are my
April favorites I feel like there wasn't
quite as many as I normally would talk
about but as I said that's because of
South Africa I was living out of two
suitcases for most of the month so hope
