my Beauty favorites and I thought I'd do
a non Beauty favorites as well because
there's just been so many things I've
been loving this month which are not
necessarily Beauty they are beautiful
but they are non beauty products
actually ended my beauty favorites with
a non beauty product here the skin and
and I thought whoops I should've gone in
that video and I'm not gonna do a whole
video just dedicated to this bag but you
know just copped up again anyway so this
video is all about the things that I've
been loving this month that are not
beauty products and there's quite a few
so I will just twist through them the
first thing I've been loving um was the
Barclay this is not the Barclay this is
the little goodie bag that they give you
after you finish afternoon tea at the
battery so a few lovely beauty bloggers
myself we're kindly invited along too
often in here the battery by Antipodes
which is that incredible you've probably
heard of in New Zealand very natural
organic life stop my stubborn um
skincare brand they the founder was over
and she's a makeup babe girl bars like
created the business from nothing from
the ground up incredible they invite us
to afternoon tea at the Barclay which I
might have blogged about by now they
have wish I had some to show you but I
ate them all they make the cakes and the
cookies and the biscuits and everything
look like the trends so they had the
most keen at home bag in a little and
Hamburg they had I think it was like a
Valentino head item the Dolce and
Gabbana I'll print dress they had like a
moose with an owl on top amazing so the
Barclays the Antipodes afternoon tea is
definitely a highlight for this month
and so one of mine on future favorites
fashion wise I have a couple of
favorites before the Barclay afternoon
tea with antibodies I took a little
stroll down Marylebone High Street I
went into whistles I picked up carne
what's going on there and you can't
really see very well but it's navy dress
um it's got like a tire on the waist and
I don't want to get fluff on it so I'm
gonna put it down I just
would be the perfect thing for wearing
to work now that's getting a little bit
warmer you can get the legs out but it's
not too short and then tire on the way
so it's just gonna be comfy flattering
and hopefully lovely another fashion
favorite that I have this month and you
guys might seen on my Instagram because
they do appear quite regularly with us
pretty is these shoes from Topshop I
have been wearing on quite a lot and do
you guys ever have that friend that like
if you get something nice show get the
exact same thing I'm that friend so one
of my friends Hannah she always looks
amazing and I just want to like
screenshot her every outfit I'm trying
copier because she always just knows how
to put stuff together and Hannah had
these shoes and she wore them when we
went to afternoon tea at the shangri-la
which was also amazing and um I just had
to have them so I'm sorry hon of thing
that friends that just copies your
outfits but I trekked all through London
to find these these are actually a size
too big for me but um you know when you
just have to have something it's worth
the sacrifice and they're so cool I love
them they look amazing my jeans and look
amazing with skirts look amazing with
like dresses everything and they're not
very high so for me actually this is
like probably the lowest heel that I own
can't walk in flats that's another story
but I love them they're from Topshop if
you can find them then well done because
I think they're in the last chance to
buy but love them something else that I
love what two things that I love too and
one is my brandy handbag and this this
is a charm from pom-pom poodles and
everybody is like oh my god if you got a
Fendi charm and I didn't even know Fundy
did these charms until kept asking me
and no it's not Fendi I think um not
sure how much they I think maybe like 40
pounds and the Fendi one is probably
about 400 pounds its raccoon um it's got
little raccoon bits on end and it's just
beautiful and I think this handbag is
gorgeous but I think it's even more
gorgeous with the pom pom one it just
makes it like really fun so that's the
pom pom by itself
it's just really really cute and it just
goes with everything could probably put
it on that too but it just that makes a
tiny that probably wouldn't just swallow
up any handbag so it lives on the Radley
bag and I use this in my everyday have
like right now it is over shoulder so I
can just stick it over my shoulder and
it's big enough for all my work stuff
well not all my work stuff I can't get
my laptop in there herbs but it's scotch
like my purse hey you go do it what's in
the handbag video but that's a whole
nother video another thing that I've
been loving this month is going to the
gym and in particular going to cycle so
cycle is like spinning but on a whole
other level so you go into the stockroom
and it's got like eucalyptus spray and
then there's like an in-house DJ and she
does these really cool tracks while
you're spinning there's like disco club
lights and I had Marie and she was just
so incredible like it's not just
spinning it's crunches and weights and
like stretches it's just so good you
come out and you're absolutely dead
because you're so knackered because she
will work you through the bone but then
you get like Bobby Brown Bobby Brown um
Humble Bundle in the bathrooms and
there's like a less skin products so
this is like a pampering and fitness and
it's just such a good way to start the
day I've done in the past two Fridays
and I am obsessed so if you live in
London
it's neat Oxford Circus squeeze on in
before work it's so good I've generally
been quite good for me at Fitness this
month so I've been going to the gym more
than I have ever done in my life not for
any particular reason
as and I'm actually been enjoying it
recently and also on that health kick
I've been trying to be my healthy cut
out some of the naughty things I was
having previously and I used to be we're
still at my big love of English
breakfast tea have two sugars in it most
the time but I have recently been loving
tea bags and in particular while this
one is that Jasmine pearls but I've
actually been loving their green tea
outfit hence why it's not in this video
but their green tea tea bags are not
gross tasting which is always a bonus
when it comes to green tea they're not
already fussing and if it tastes gross
we just won't drink it so tea pigs green
tea is not gross it's really nice
actually and I've been going through
like four cups a day but I have only
been using two tea bags so I've been
leaving the tea bag in and then just
filling it up again which sounds gross
but um it works and I like it and it's
been making but not just that but my
skin's been feeling and looking good
recently I had more energy and I think
it's just down to a combination and if
you're trying to get healthy before some
of them switch your builders brew for
green tea and yeah tea bags is really
nice so give that a try oh and my last
non-beauty favorite I guess that's not
meeting and when I went to Texas last
month I bought a lot of stuff surprise
surprise I should do a Texas hole
I did a Texas whole block post but it's
all scattered now so I can't do a video
but one of my favorites was something
that I picked about that Tory Burch and
Tory Burch is quite expensive in the UK
but in the u.s. I swear they just
changed the pants and dollar signs so
everything is a lot cheaper and one of
my favorite things this month has been
this Tory Burch candle the smell is so
so nice I can't even describe it it says
it's called the Boogie perfume or bougie
797 Madison it doesn't tell me what it
is though
I don't know what the smell is it's
really fresh I'm like no it just smells
expensive and I've been lighting it
I've been lighting it nearly every
evening I haven't got through that much
of it and it just makes my room smell
divine and I mean look at it it's so
pretty
and leaving the lid this little Tory
Burch thing so you can not like it bust
into it which i think is one most Mike
Andrews very puffy and Bruce I love this
it's so pretty so that's my last blonde
beauty favorite so I hope you liked that
