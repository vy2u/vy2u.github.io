favorites video I know everybody's been
saying it but this month really has just
gone SuperDuper fast if you saw my vlog
but I posted actually two vlogs it was
so long that I had to do part 1 and part
2 but if you saw my vlogs this week then
you'll have seen that this has been my
first month as full-time blogger and
youtuber which is really exciting and I
thought that I would just have like 2/3
time I'd be at home and be able to get
everything done but it has not been like
that I have been backed about meetings
out in town and I've not really had any
free time so my favorite is actually
quite small smaller than I thought it
would be because I just haven't really
had time to do that much stuff if you
know what I mean if that makes sense
the first thing that is in my favorites
this month you guys will probably
already predicts this if you follow me
on Instagram and of course it is my
gorgeous baby boy this is Dexter he is
he is very Wiggly because we just took
him to pets at home and found a little
alligator toy which he's now beheaded
and he has never been so in love with a
toy before so this joking so he's
absolutely in love with this this is
definitely Dexter's August favorite I
mean give it back to him and let him
play around from the floor but this
Wiggly little boy he is just oh my gosh
I'm really gonna put him down go on his
Instagram photo some cute pictures of
him but of course he is my biggest
favorite thing of this whole month and
this whole year and basically my whole
lifetime I am so so so in love with him
and I just can't stop kissing him every
time I see him I just want to bury my
face in his little hairy cheeks I just
love him so much and he's running
towards mean it's the cutest thing I
mean look look at that face look at that
thing
are you my love better are you I love
him okay I'm gonna let Dexter run around
and play because I don't want to be
depriving him of his yummy toys now you
come and sit on my lap I love you I do I
love you alright I'm going to get
started on the future products I've
probably only got four or five or five
or six to go through so I'll get
cracking on those first the first couple
of items are
that combination I've been wearing for
the past I'd say ten days or so since I
first got them and they're both from
urban decay firstly there's this
lipstick and this is the matte
stark-naked lipstick in the shade
you shall live or maybe it's the Rouge
alev matte lipstick in shade stark-naked
I don't know but either way I will post
the details on this down below but it's
a it's a matte lipstick but it doesn't
come out too matte so I sometimes find
matte lipsticks quite drying especially
as you go into the cooler months but
this one has a really moisturizing
formula I've got this and the liner
which I'm about to talk about on today
and even though my lips are pretty dry
at the moment I still just find it a
really lovely combination yeah and then
with the lipstick I've been wearing the
matching Urban Decay liner it's there
24/7 glide-on lip liner in the shade
lighter this is actually a shade darker
than the lipstick but I'm really liking
that effect at the moment so you can
still see that you lined your lips even
when you put the liner on these two are
my lip combination favourites of August
also from Urban Decay which I picked up
at Debenhams is their new Urban Decay
smoky number 4 and Naked palette I never
thought I'd be able to put away in my
Naked 3 palette I just thought it was
irreplaceable but not that it's been
replaced but this has certainly become
my everyday go-to palette I have to say
though I haven't fully got full use out
of it yeah I've actually only been using
really three of the shades and that's
whisky combust and 13 which is the three
everyday smokey shades I'm not really
very outgoing when it comes to smokey
eye so I'm almost trying to teach myself
how to do smokey eyes starting off on
the easy shades and then I'm sure as we
get into the cooler months the more
festive months I'll move towards the
more sparkly shades because
radar and dirty sweet and also high as
well they are such gorgeous shades
really lovely shimmering Browns I just
haven't had the right occasion to wear
them yet but this color as a whole is
absolutely gorgeous so much more
wearable than I thought it would be and
Urban Decay have also updated their
brush that comes with it any move that
that and then can you see this little
man here hello you know you can't see
him but he's here easy yeah just like a
dog lovin house at the moment got all
the dogs around and never
they're kissing anyway back to the
brushes so urban decay ever updated
their makeup brush I really liked the
one that came in the three because it
had the blendable end and the end which
you could do a really sharp liner not
sharp but yeah a nice precise line this
one has gone even fluffier blending
brush which is just another level to the
Naked 3 and this end is very densely
packed not sure what you'd really call
this doesn't have anything on it but
it's a rounded version of the liner
brush I think this is really useful for
doing smudging under the eye and if you
use one of the darker shades like I've
been you some whiskey to just line the
eye a little bit and blend it out with
this brush so the brush as well is a
favorite if that can be your favorite
but it's the one that comes with the
smoky form and everybody liked it
keeping it with the eyes theme my next
favorite is the Clinique chubby lash
mascara I featured this in my new in
video which I think was published a
couple of weeks ago and correct me I'm
losing track of time but I really like
the intensity that this gives my lashes
it's got very short little spikes on the
brush which I wasn't sure what impact
they would have but they've really
wiggle in between the lashes separate
them out and I just find this to be such
a black black mascara which obviously is
great I haven't been using a liquid
liner recently I haven't been using any
movement there I haven't been using any
liquid liner recently so if I wake all
this just really really close to the
eyelid if that makes sense it's been
giving my lashes enough definition that
I haven't needed to wear liner so this
along with the Urban Decay Naked smokey
make it 4 is my winning eye combo off
this month and then on days when I want
to have a little bit more drama to the
eyes I have been using Fleur de forces
new lashes from the Ilia range this is
the Fleur loves lashes or see the boxes
antiques I'm wearing them right now but
they are the 3/4 lashes as there are you
know that they're going to really good
quality and I just love the fact that
they are three quarters so it's not the
full lash which makes them more
appropriate for everyday wear or just
special occasions that aren't quite
suitable for a full on fold lash I'm not
hugely a lash person I don't like to
look like I'm making too much effort if
that makes sense but these does look so
lovely and natural that I have found
myself reaching
these on a very regular basis next we
have a couple of bathroom favorites and
my first one is the new L'Occitane
L'Occitane locks town who knows the new
I say L'Occitane the new L'Occitane
rebalancing shower gel exfoliating
anyway this shower gel has got a really
really lovely fragrance to it when I
first got it through the letterbox I
opened up the package and straight away
the whole room was almost filled with
this lovely fragrance it's really hard
to describe its kind of Mediterranean II
herb early but it has a very lovely
fragrance which is really very powerful
so normally with shower gels you can't
really smell them that much on you when
you love them up but I used this with
one of those kind of scrunching you net
but I used that with this in the bath
the other day and it was so amazing my
whole bathroom smelled like I was in
some kind of French spa up in the hills
in like a vineyard or an olive grove or
something it was amazing and I found
that a little went a long way I probably
only used about a half a 5p piece worth
of this and I really scrubbed it all up
in my neck for me whatever you call it
thing and it covered my whole body with
loads and loads of leather so this is
definitely a favorite number which I
highly recommend if you want a slightly
more luxurious kind of hydrate rave hat
that's a toy next thing from my bathroom
favorites is the Aran amber musk body
lotion I originally found love with this
because it looks so beautiful it's got
the most gorgeous pattern on it and
lovely rose detailing so I fell in love
with this because I just kind of wanted
to feature on my Instagram but you know
global problems but anyway I was also
really delighted delighted that such an
old fashioned word I was thrilled when I
discovered but it was also really really
lovely product inside its not gonna
overpowering scent I thought that with a
brand like Erin it would be really
really fragrant of course her perfumes
are amazing so I thought it would have a
hugely overpowering scent but I was
actually really pleasantly surprised
that the scent is really subtle
does stay on the skin a long time which
I love so if you wear before bed then
you just have this really lovely smell
about you and your pajamas smell really
nice I call is make tragic things but I
absolutely love this fragrance so this
has had pride of place in my bathroom
for all the world to see
it's so beautiful that I cannot bear to
put it away next up is the fragrance I
have been obsessed with this month and
it's Jo Malone pomegranate noir I know
this is a really old
or should I say classic fragrance and
they recently launched their mimosa and
cardamom which I also absolutely love
however I rediscovered the pomegranate
fragrance recently and I just find it
such a lovely scent to this kind of
transitional time of year it's a very
warming very comforting fragrance and it
will saddling there's a really long time
so it's great to put on over knitwear
because then the next time you put your
jumper on it also smells lovely
and I think this fragrance reminds me of
something maybe my mom used to wear it a
few years ago but it's one of those
fragrances that just really has happy
memories so I've been wearing this on a
daily basis for the past couple of weeks
and I think this will probably become my
autumn winter fragrance because it's
just such a lovely warm scent the next
thing that I've been loving is a home
web piece if you can recall this home
wear but basically it's this gorgeous
mug which is from mug by deco and it's
got my initials on it which of course I
absolutely love I can't really move it
too much at the moment because it's
filled with tea which I've only just
boiled so I don't want to spill it all
over myself but it's got really gorgeous
gold detailing pretty polkadot it's
really beautiful I'm kind of keeping it
on display not putting it away in my
cabinets and this is really random and
it's also really fine around the edges I
don't like chunky China I just find it
so much nicer to use fine crockery and
this is really fine so um it gets a big
tick from me and then the last couple of
things I've been loving for this month
are two bits of jewelry from Swarovski
and the first is this necklace which I'm
wearing at the moment and it's gold
weird little diamonds not diamonds you
know Swarovski crystals in this v-shaped
triangle and it's very dainty and
delicate but also quite a striking piece
I've had so many compliments and I've
been wearing this it also goes really
nicely with this ring which is my final
favorite product and it's got loads of
different bands on it there's bands full
of crystals chunky bands plain gold
bands and they look really gorgeous
together and the fact that they're very
is gold as well you guys know how much
I love rose gold so it means that they
match the rest of my jewelry those of my
watches are rose gold bracelets
everything rose gold I love it so but
they just match everything is the point
I'm trying to make so absolutely love
these two pieces so Dexter and I really
hope that you have enjoyed this video or

gonna go for a walk with his daddy
