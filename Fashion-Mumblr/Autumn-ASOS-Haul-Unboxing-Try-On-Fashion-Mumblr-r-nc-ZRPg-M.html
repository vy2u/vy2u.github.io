ASOS shopping haul unboxing and trying
on video I was originally going to do
just one long video with all of my
autumn hauls put together because we've
also been shopping in Topshop River
Island super dry and a few more but
instead when I saw how big the Asus box
was it's this big I thought I'd better
do one video purely devoted to ASOS
if you've seen my haul videos previously
what I normally do is try things on
obviously after I finish filming and
include clips over the top of what I'm
talking about the products but that way
I can't really tell you about the fit so
what I'm going to do this time is I'm
going to open the box
have a look at the products for the
first time talk about the style and then
also do some voiceovers well I try the
products on at the very end so make sure
you stick around to the end of this
video so you can see me trying on and
what I think about the fit so the things
that I've bought are all kind of
autumnal trendy trendy trend driven
pieces there are a few of my favorite
trends which was seeing going through
from summer to autumn like suede of
course that lovely rust color and yet
you'll see the rest of the bits I picked
up anyway so without further ado let's
have a little look at the first thing
that I picked up so the first thing is
this lovely midi-length
grey dress and this is a sauce own brand
and I actually pick it up a petite
because that's what I found first and I
am quite petite so it's nice to have
things that are in proportion I think
normal Middies mid length items would
just be a little bit too long for me not
sure exactly how tall I am but I'm
definitely not that tall this has got a
lovely caller ID call this like a vicar
caller I'm not sure the official name
but it's a high-necked color and it's
got lovely paneled dark detailing so I
think this is going to be really lovely
shape on the bodice and then we've got
this buckle which gives a lovely
definition on the waist as well so I
think this is going to be really
flattering this would also look really
cute as like a jumpsuit or culottes with
three-quarter length charles's which i
think of river island have something
similar to and then on the back if you
can see it's got these two buttons which
make it almost like a nurse's uniform
like a pinafore it kind of reminds me of
that kind of closure and then the lovely
keyhole open detail at the back which is
going to look lovely this feels like a
really lovely quality piece and I really
like this color and just thinking how
much where I'm gonna get out of
something that's this shape and color at
this time of year but we'll see next
thing in the box and obviously I've
already unwrapped these pieces so though
take too long to get them all out of the
plastic wrapping but this is also a
source own brand and it's not it's a
brand called
only only my favorite wardrobe and this
is a kind of rock print skirt it looks
ginormous but actually this is quite a
tiny little waistband and it's got a
lovely very autumnal coloured pattern on
it these are kind of sweethearts
describe this pattern this almost looks
like a traditional English kind of like
family crest style pattern and then
you've got like a floral burnt orange
navy and red detail pattern on it but
this would look really nice when it gets
a bit cooler with really thick tights
and some boots on so that's a lovely one
next up and this I saw that it got into
into sale I'd had my eyes on it for a
little while and it's this gorgeous
black suede skirt this is probably my
fifth suede skirt what happened to the
lighting it's because when I lift this
up my camera adjusts automatically so
I'm just going to show you yourself out
show you the skirt first and then I'll
carry on talking so it's this lovely
black suede skirt with pocket detailing
I'm guessing it is real suede because I
think it was a routinely quite expensive
it really annoys me that they don't put
the prices on the tags I can never
remember what I paid for stuff my
fingers had gone down to about the forty
pound mark as I said I think is about my
fifth suede skirt but I do wear my suede
skirt loads and loads I have a black one
from Miss Selfridge which I think it's
got it to the bottom my suede burnt
orange one from a source of school it
wasn't my suede one from I'm not going
to go through all my side skirts but I
wear them a lot and this one was quite
different because of the exposed seam
detail and yeah I think again in the
winter black tights that look lovely
this one is quite names
I'm intrigued to see what its gonna look
like on its lovely copper again that
rusty colored dress and it has this
really interesting metal ball detail
around the waist and around the bustline
and along the arm lines on holes yeah on
hoth and it's really structured as well
you can see the detail on the back how
it's got the different scenes so I think
this will be a really lovely shape and
its silhouette wise it's quite a skater
style dress really hard to show you
again but it's got like a skater style
skirt and then a zip fastening all the
way to the top so I think as far as
autumnal dresses go this one's pretty
much perfect I don't really have many
dresses that are suitable for autumn
most of my dresses tend to be in the
summer category but in autumn
it's just so nice to not have to worry
about putting things together if you can
just stick on a dress then that's a
bonus the next thing in here is this
ginormous fluffy scarf I picked this up
because all of my scarves I just feel
like they're a little bit old-fashioned
and out-of-date that either that kind of
paisley print you know we always to have
those pashminas or their old designer
ones which I don't know I just kind of
find them a little bit chavvy now so I
got this one it's very chic it's just
white and gray I love gray and has the
tassels on the end and it's it's really
huge it's really hard to show you how
thick it is but it's ginormous
so this will be great for warmth and for
trend factor and it's not it's not the
softest blanket and blanket it's not the
softest scarf that I've ever felt that
it's definitely it is soft it's just not
the softest because it wasn't that's
expensive as some my silk or cashmere
scarves in fact let's have a little look
at the fabric content so it's a hundred
percent acrylic which means it's
washable which is great because light
colors are bound to get makeup on and as
it's a non natural fabric it's being
able to manufactured so it is nice and
soft but as I said not as soft as a silk
or cashmere scarf but really really
lovely then we have the world's the most
soft and fluffy dressing-gown this is
actually a new-look dressing-gown but I
picked it up from a sauce it's seriously
so soft this is like that it's so hard
to describe it just it feels almost
liquid and my hands like putty or
something it's so incredibly soft on
this side and then the inside you've got
this gorgeous warm sheepskin obviously
not real sheepskin lining and I'm so
glad that on the body but you've got the
mean fluff as well this just looks like
the most scrumptious thing in the whole
world
if you guys have seen my not short video
but I featured my Dora keeper I think
it's Dorothy Perkins dressing-gown it's
like leopard print which I love but it's
in its third year now
Dexter loves cheering it is fraying one
of the pockets the seams have come out
of it so whenever I put my phone in it
smashes on the floor which is not good
so I think it's time that I got new
dressing-gown this one's Gray's that's
quite classic and seriously guys it is
so soft by the way I'm gonna be leaving
the links to all of these products down
below in case you front-seat checking
that as well maybe treating yourself I'm
actually done with the box but I already
took these out of the box and it's pair
of shoes from River Island but obviously
I got them from a source website and
these are called the yesica boots I got
a size to me because that is my size and
they look something like this I've been
looking for our terminal boot for so
long and these just seem to tick every
single box they are a very natural color
so they'll go with a lot of things
perfect heel height and they've actually
got a sneaky tiny tiny hidden platform
in the sole which it's just amazing
because it gives me a little bit of
height but they're still easy to walk in
I don't think I've ever owned any boots
that go up quite as high as this but I'm
sure it'll go is lots of whether it's
with tights or like jeans and the color
and the feel of these it's really I'm
not sure if they're suede on the outside
I think they looked like a faux suede
they've got a zip at the back so these
yeah
really pleased with these there were 85
pounds so not too cheap but I think
definitely use student discount you can
get 10% off or sometimes a sauce you do
25% off don't they and I think river
islands have 25 cent off at the moment
so yeah if you want to pick up these
again I'll leave the link down below but
I really like these and I think I'll get
a lot of use out of these in the autumn
season as I said I also picked up loads
of things from Topshop super dry and
the island and I'm going to be posting
that whole video tomorrow because I
thought I just need one ginormous long
video if I did it all in one so now
let's try on all the pieces so I can let
you guys know all about the fit so this
is quite a stranger on this is the gray
dress that I showed you firstly there's
nowhere for you to tuck in this dangly
strap from the waistband I've had to
pull it quite tight even though this
dress isn't a petite section but there's
no loop for me to tuck it in and I'm not
sure that I like having this dangly bit
I really like the shape of the bodice
it's got really nice darts so it fits
beautifully and the detail at the back
is also really nice although it was
quite hard to do up because of those two
buttons the length is nice I think if
you're taller than me even it would
probably look even better it's quite
modest it's probably a little bit
old-fashioned I prefer them to be a
little bit higher maybe like this kind
of height still being demure and the
fact that there's no pockets I quite
like to have somewhere to put my hands
so overall I'm not completely happy with
this dress I think I will return it but
if you're taller than me and maybe you
can figure out a solution for the dangly
waist band then go for dress number two
and I'm much happier with this one I
really like the fit of it there's no
dangly straps it's just got this really
gorgeous detail around the middle it's
really fine they kind of roll when you
put your fingers over them it's really
lovely shape from the bodice very true
to size I picked up a size six which is
my usual side size and then it's quite a
skater style silhouette which is really
lovely it's got a nice fitted back and
the baubles go only half way around not
all the way around which I'm okay with I
really love the color of this as well
and the fabric is nice and thick so good
for autumn next is this skirt and this
is actually much too big so I picked up
my usual size but as you can see it's
just far too big for me which is a shame
because I really love the pattern I
think in winter I'd normally wear this
with a black roll neck jumper but today
mine's in the wash I've worn it with
this white Primark top which has got
this faux detail so it's kind of a 70s
boho look as I said I absolutely love
this guy I just wish it wasn't so big
I'm gonna see if they got four otherwise
I'm not going to be able to keep it but
actually had the opposite problem with
this skirt it was really
Minnie took me quite a lot of effort to
get it over my hips but so worth it once
it's on absolutely love it's such a
classic design I can tell it's coming
one of those that when I walk it's gonna
wiggle around a little bit but
absolutely love it the shape and the
size is absolutely perfect really happy
with this one so that's it I hope you
