me for today's video I'm going to be
going through my top ten autumn wardrobe
essentials in today's videos so these
are the pieces that I find myself
wearing over and over again at this time
of year a few of them are kind of basic
pieces real building blocks for your
autumn wardrobe few of them a slightly
more statement but they are the pieces
that I find myself wearing time and time
again for that reason a few of these are
slightly more investment pieces but
equally there's lots of high-street
pieces in here too and then for a few of
these top 10 essentials I've got a few
different pricing alternatives as well
so hopefully there's going to be
something in here for everybody before I
get started I just want to let you know
that we're very close to 200,000
subscribers so if you regularly watch my

that I mentioned in this video will also
be linked down in the description box as
well as things like I'm wearing my
lipstick all the information you could
possibly need is down in description box
so just click show more for that kind of
thing so without further ado let's get
started with my top ten autumn wardrobe
essentials number one is a chunky knit
jumper this will come as no surprise and
I feel like no autumn wardrobe is
complete without a chunky knit jumper
the one that I wanted to talk to you
guys about or share with you if you've
been watching my outfit Diaries will
come as no surprise it is this one which
is an absolute steal from the Marks and
Spencer the reason why I love this one
is firstly the value is 35 pounds which
is rather incredible so price per wear
on this one really really low because
it's the kind of thing that's so classic
you will wear it so much I find this
type of jumper very versatile for
dressing up dressing down obviously you
days when you're at home you can just
wear this with some jogging bottoms or
pajama bottoms but then also if you want
to dress it up a little bit you could
style it with something like a midi
skirt or even with some leather leggings
those are a few of my favorite
combinations this one in particular the
fabric is so soft it's just got a
beautiful hang to it very simple and for
something like this where simplicity
really is the key
you think why spend loads of money if
you can get something like this for 35
pounds so that's probably my number one
and water of essential design detail
wise it's just got slightly ribbed
sleeves a slight dip in the hem so it's
a little bit longer at the back and then
a really lovely high collar which I love
all kinds of reasons number one being
super super snuggly so a chunky knit is
definitely my number one autumn
essential obviously you can get loads of
variations on the chunky knit even
something like this whereas it's not
quite so chunky it is a fabulous very
cozy piece of knitwear this is also a
high street piece very affordable and
this is very wearable as well because
it's such a neutral color
I find that knitwear in these neutral or
tunnel colors such as burgundy light
Browns I'd call this almost like a
caramel chestnut color there so wearable
so practical and work in loads of
different outfit combinations this one
as well really snuggly with a high neck
keeps you lovely and toasty but it's
still fairly feminine and chic as well
having said what I said about the M&amp;amp;S
jumper and the price per wear being so
great because I do wear this type of
tops so often in the autumn months it is
a piece that I'm equally happy to invest
a little bit more in I do have a jumper
quite similar to this from Reese as well
and it's more of a cashmere material so
if you think you're going to get loads
of wear out of something like this and
do want to spend a little bit more than
Reese is probably my favorite retailer
for those kind of purchases it's just so
lovely to have a cashmere mix material
or a wool blend on your skin really
lovely and snuggly for the many
occasions that you'll find yourself
wearing the network my second wardrobe
basic for autumn is ankle boots and I
have a couple of pairs to give us
examples here first of all the more
classic option would be a pair of black
ankle boots ankle boots for me are ones
that crop just above the ankle you wear
them most often with maybe tights or
jeans or leggings leather leggings it's
my favorite way of styling them and I
like to go for ankle boots with a little
bit of a heel I'm not the tallest so a
little height boost is always
appreciated
but I do like them to be very wearable
so a small heel especially a chunky heel
I find that our West so much because I
know that they're comfortable but they
do give me that height boost that I need
so I've chosen these to share with you
these ones are kerger again they'll be
linked
down below because they're black they're
very very versatile I find myself
reaching for them for so many outfit
combinations you'll have seen these in
my first outfit diary video starred in a
very very casual way but because of the
almost like faux croc patent leather and
this round buckle which is very on-trend
they definitely have a very high-end
look to them and they look far more
expensive than their high street price
tag equally I think that ankle boots can
be beautifully dressed up and that's why
I want to share with you this pair these
are from Reese so a little bit of a
higher price point than the previous
ones but they make every outfit look so
fabulous
I found myself wearing these once again
now the leggings I probably should have
included other leggings as an automotive
staple but I know that they're not for
everybody
this looks great underneath a jumper
dress with jeans as well especially dark
jeans these would look absolutely
fabulous and they do have a stiletto
heel which for some people is not as
comfortable as a block heel I don't find
myself being quite so stable on them but
because these are a little bit more
dressy I find myself wearing them for
short periods of time such as evening
events and yet the color is so versatile
so it goes a lots of different outfit
combinations for this time of year
speaking of boots my autumn basic number
3 is a pair of over knee boots or
knee-high boots this first pair is a
very affordable pair from public desire
well I definitely have the Stuart
Weitzman's on my wish list I find that
actually affordable stores do very good
over knee boots I do have a few tips for
when you're looking for them personally
I like over knee boots with a chunky
heel because it makes them so wearable
for a full day and also this may not be
quite such an obvious one but I always
like to check the material inside the
boots I had a pair last year that were
very silky and satiny on the inside and
they just slid down my leg and I found
myself constantly every 5 minutes
pulling them up and I looked like Nora
Bhatia most of the time so check for the
material is a little bit more grippy has
a little bit more friction to it on the
inside because then you won't find
yourself pulling them up it's great if
they have a little bit of elasticity in
the bit that goes up your leg because
obviously the better fit the better they
look so that's something else to look
out for and if you go for a suede pair
just make sure to protect them because
of the nature of over knee boots are
going to want to wear them no matter the
weather so protecting them with suede
spray is a great way to ensure they last
a little
longer so for me I like to have a darker
pair I find these go jeans really nicely
any darker colored jumper dresses but
then because I have a very cream and
beige focus wardrobe I also have a
lighter pair these I got from Zara last
year I will try and find a similar
alternative that you can buy this year
and they'll be linked down below I do
have it on good authority that Karen
Millen is bringing out the pair this
color with beautiful chunky heel in a
couple of weeks so if they're out yet
I'll leave them down below but if not
you're probably missing the moments
around me for too long I think that over
knee boots just instantly complete look
and give you far more of a chic finish
to your outfit so highly recommend
investing in a pair of those for your
autumn wardrobe as well
my next essential is a wool coat now
here in the UK it's not actually got
that cold yet but on certain mornings it
can be really bitterly cold and I always
find that by the time it gets freezing
cold all the coats have gone from the
stores so investing in a really lovely
coat at this time of year I would
suggest is the way forward the one that
I have chosen this year is this
beautiful khaki will blend one from
Reece I just think it's so classic
slightly unusual in that it's khaki not
black or ox blood or camel like I would
normally go for but I think this color
is just so wearable almost is a neutral
shade because it's from Reese you know
the tailoring is absolutely beautiful it
just fits the shoulders perfectly fits
the waist perfectly it's got a waistband
and a waist belt so you can really cinch
it in to get that feminine shape the
material is absolutely beautiful it's
lined it's got pockets it's got darts to
give it that perfect shape I've
mentioned this in so many videos but for
me outerwear and accessories is where I
really like to invest at this time of
year because most of the time when
you're out and about walking there are
the bits that people see from your
outfit so certainly coats bags and shoes
are where I like to spend a little bit
more because they are the bits that get
seen the most and that arguably you get
the most use out of throughout autumn
and winter so that's a bit more of an
investment piece although still price
per wear I think could be very very good
on that one but it's a more affordable
option you've seen me talking about this
so much this is my camel coat from River
Island I think camel coats are
incredibly versatile similar to the
recent one it has a waist belt this
color I find goes in so many outfits I
find myself reaching for this so so
and it's a really great high street out
of our peace so anyone that knows me
well or has watched my channel for quite
a while will not be surprised by my next
autumn wardrobe essential it is a
thermal I have kind of like a running
joke with my friends that underneath my
jump is in autumn ninety percent of time
including right now you will find me
wearing a thermal I'm like an ambassador
for thermals I think they're the best
thing you could possibly invest in
they're not expensive at all and yet you
can wear so many more things and not
have to worry about quite so much alt
aware and layering during the autumn
months because they keep you so warm not
just keeping you warm they're great at
temperature regulating so I don't find
myself overheating or freezing which
especially if you live in London is so
important because it'll be freezing cold
out in the streets and then in shops on
the tube it's absolutely roasting so
something that regulates your
temperature is fabulous if you feel the
cold or if you live in a cold place and
I'm sure you already know about thermals
and for me I always go to Marks &amp;amp;
Spencer they are just they have the best
selection there loads of different
colorways loads of different sleeve
lengths neck options they have some roll
next they have some scoop necks strappy
top vests long-sleeve but these are the
two designs that I usually go for year
after year both in white because I find
that sometimes patterns might get seen
through my other clothing so I tend to
go for the plainer options and I have
long sleeve ones with a scoop neck
because I find that it's the best for
keeping me warm but also being versatile
underneath necklines because I don't
really like my thermal - come on show
don't like letting everyone in on my
secret but this is a slightly thinner
material it's perfect for under slightly
more fitting jumpers and if your jumper
has slightly itchy wool or fabric
filaments then this will stop the jumper
from itching you for thicker jumpers or
if it's a really cold day I also have a
slightly thicker version this one is
beautifully soft on the inside it has
like brushed fabric so really really
cozy to wear once again it's a very wide
neck so even if your jumper is not a
roll neck if it's got slightly open neck
then you still won't be able to see this
again with long sleeves in white super
cozy super affordable and just an
absolute essential with my autumn and
winter wardrobe you only have to spend a
few moments scrolling through your
Instagram feed to know that
all the cool street star people have so
many great looks that are focused around
warhead and jeans as time of year
whether it's pairing with something like
this a really cozy knit or even with a
blouse denim is of course a staple at
any time of year but this season that I
know that just cropped above the ankle
and a raw hem is a style that everyone's
going to be wearing and lusting over
this time of year and so for that reason
a pair of raw hemmed jeans is another of
my autumn basics this season personally
I like to wear these with mules and also
ankle boots because the length really
frames the boot you can definitely see
your shoe style it's not covered up by
any long hems
instead the cropped length really helps
to frame them so if you have invested in
your Footwear then this will really show
them off I like my jeans to be really
high-waisted quite old-school in that
style but I find it most comfortable
most flattering and this is a pair of
Topshop moto jeans that take all the
boxes for me
great color denim great fit at the top
perfect kind of almost drainpipe star at
the bottom row hems although technically
if you've got a pair of jeans that you
love the fits and you were willing to do
over to DIY you could always just chop
the ends off yourself that's an even
more affordable way of doing it but
these are my perfect pair of jeans this
autumn now this kind of depends on your
personal style but for me and I'm sure
for a lot of you a trench coat is a
really great basic piece to have in your
water your water your your wardrobe this
autumn I personally love trench coaches
oh my god I can talk
I've heard some Lee love trench coats
they come back into fashion
year after year so it is nice to invest
a little bit more having said that the
high street has some really beautiful
ones at the moment there is one on my
wish list from Topshop I think it's
called the editor coat definitely looks
like a kind of fashion editor style
I'll leave a photo of that one there and
leave a link down below fabulous high
street one this one is from Ted Baker
I've had this for a little while you
might recognize this from a video I did
not too long ago and I find myself
wearing this so much such a classic
piece definitely worth the investment
price per wear is already really super
low on this piece I really like that
it's got the piping around the edges
just gives it a little bit more design
detail than your plain trenchcoat there
is something just so classic so British
and so luxurious about a trenchcoat that
it really does add instant timeless
style points to any outfit and a piece
that you just know that you'll reach for
year after year autumn basic number
eights I think we're on now for me is a
jumper dress I did a whole video on
Starling jumper dresses not too long ago
because I think they're the best things
have in your wardrobe or autumn they're
not only super cozy but they are so easy
to put on when you wear a jumper dress
that is literally your entire outfit
sorted just pair with some ankle boots
or some other knee boots like I do and
your look is complete you don't need to
worry about matching anything it really
is just instant mindless outfit and
looks and feels fabulous each and every
time a few of my favorites in fact I
have three favorites here to show you
all different price points the most
affordable is probably my favorite
actually this is from ASOS
it's a cashmere blend and it was only 30
pounds I don't think there's many sizes
left unfortunately but I will leave it
link down below anyway because of the
neutral color I just find myself wearing
it time and time again and it is so so
comfy because of that cashmere content
it slightly more expensive but still a
high-street warned that this one from
River Island more pinky so very me very
feminine and girly it has slightly
ballooning sleeves which is a good nod
to that autumn winter trend which I
mentioned in my autumn winter 17 trend
video that I'll leave linked up here
here the length on this is absolutely
perfect the material is really super
snuggly and every time I wear this I get
questions whereas your jumper dress form
and everybody just absolutely loves it
because also it does have this high neck
you guessed it you can wear a thermal
underneath it but what I do need to do
is invest in some big Bridget Jones
granny knickers so that I can tuck my
thermal into my knickers because there
is nothing more annoying than when your
thermal starts to roll up giving you
like a thin roll around your tummy and
you just can't sort that out in public
when you're wearing a jumper dress so
big knickers and thermals are the way to
go with jumper dresses I feel like
knickers is a really British word what
do you guys say did you say like
Underpants I don't know I don't know
what other countries say about it we say
knickers and
fifthly on my next jump address favorite
is this one that I picked up from my
trip to Manchester I got this in
Selfridges it's an All Saints one and
it's very figure hugging so I have to be
quite good with my diet before where I
miss because you can literally see
everything I adore this ruffle detail
around the neck and around the sleeves
and it is quite long so it's very
elegant looking looks great with heels
and I actually need to wear that more
I've not worn that too much and I'm
determined to get a lot of wear out fix
it was think 150 pounds but yeah jumper
dresses for me such a fabulous basic
piece that you will wear so much this
autumn my next autumn basic again it's
not for everyone but I think once you
have one and you start wearing it you'll
realize how versatile they are and it is
a G lay I have two different ones to
show you that I actually love both
different price points this one is from
Topshop I think it was around 65 pounds
I think this looks a lot like real fur
not that that's particularly desirable
but I think it looks really lovely
really luxurious and I just really like
the colorings of this one because it is
a neutral shade again very very
versatile you could wear it over jumper
dress like the ones I showed you earlier
also over knit wear it could definitely
work over something like what I'm
wearing now and they're very practical
as well you can still see your outfit
underneath so if you don't want to be
totally bundled up and not be able to
see what you're wearing then relays are
grapes you can wear open obviously your
arms are out gives you a lot more
flexibility and it showcases your outfit
underneath a lot better but still
keeping your body very very warm and
then this one is more of a recent treat
to myself recent shoot to myself from
Reece it is a slightly lilac II gray
color it feels very very luxurious and
very soft and cozy because it does have
this folding collar you really find
yourself melting into it so snuggly it's
so warm but it does elevate an outfit
it's a piece of outerwear that really
completes the look I have been wearing
it with faux leather trousers and I have
a pair that are in kind of like a nudie
cream color then also just a blouse
underneath or perhaps a pale colored
jumper it doesn't go with quite as many
things as a Topshop one but it just
looks so so fabulous when you have the
right colour combination so if you have
a similar
toan to your wardrobe as I do and I'm
sure something like this will work
really really beautifully keep an eye on
the outfit diary video that I published
next Monday because I've pretty much
been wearing this and my final autumn
wardrobe basic is another accessory and
is small crossbody bags so at this time
of the year traditionally you tend to
mainly carry a little bit more with you
in which case a bucket bag is really
practical but I find that as well as a
bucket bag or on days and I'm just
nipping out I'm finding myself reaching
for small crossbody bags really really
often I have three to share with you all
different price points starting with
this one which is the most affordable I
love this I think it looks so high-end
it really looks very on trend when
you're wearing it it looks fabulous more
on crossbody and it definitely has kind
of 60s boho vibes about it almost
bordering on Chloe vibes because of the
round shape round bags are so in at the
moment and this one I just love still
find it big enough to fit in all my
essentials vlogging camera persephone
battery charger that kind of thing
price-wise the next one up is this one
if you follow me on instagram josie LDN
then you would have seen me stealing
this so so often I've been wearing it
with loads of outfit combinations it is
an Aspen or trunk bag this was one that
I bought kind of not knowing whether I
loved it and I absolutely loved it it
gets a game and get so many compliments
the styling and the detailing on this
are so beautiful I wasn't sure how
practical I find such a stiff kind of
square bag but it's surprisingly roomy
it does again fit all my essentials in
there and I feel like it adds such a
beautiful finish to an outfit as I said
earlier over the top of your coat the
thing that makes a biggest statement in
your autumn wardrobe aside from your
coat choice is your back choice and this
one certainly makes a really lovely
statement and then on the higher end of
things I have got my wire sell sunset
bag I love this bag so much I think that
the material is so beautiful gray it was
a slightly unusual choice for me but I
find it worked with so many different
color combinations no matter what color
my outfit is whether it's more on the
nude side whether I'm wearing a kind of
burgundy like oxblood color it just
works perfectly I like that it's got a
little bit of branding on there so it
does add more of an expensive luxurious
feel to your outfit if that's the kind
of look that you're going for and then
inside inside on my dog food bags shows
how much I use I get out of this inside
it's got three big sections or two big
sections and then little pocket section
so great for keeping all of your stuff
organized what else I got in here my
neighbor lien lipsticks it just means I
can carry all of my essentials in there
without a problem and keeps everything
very nicely organized as well so that's
my higher-end choice for crossbody bags
so those are my top ten autumn wardrobe
essentials I really hope you guys found
this useful and I hope that you'll
potentially find some inspiration in
this video for injecting some newness
into your autumn wardrobe please share
with me your thoughts in the comments

essential pieces please do let me know
