be my everyday autumn makeup routine
using some of my favorite drugstore
products I haven't sat down and film to
makeup routine in what feels like months
and months
I think the may be the only other one
that I did was my everyday makeup
routine which was more of a spring
summer look and in autumn I tend to use
a slightly thicker base a bit more
contouring and a really nice deep
colored lip so without further ado this
is my everyday or two makeup routine so
the first thing I'm going to be using is
the number 7 airbrush away primer I find
this as a really good product for making
my pores look a little bit smaller and
any fine lines maybe from just you know
you get lines in the sleep of pillow
lines you know what I'm talking about
this just helps to smooth them out and
it creates a really good base for my
makeup so I'm going to start by applying
this just my fingers all over my face
it's called airbrush primer and I really
do find that it goes quite soft focus
effects on my skin so especially if I'm
going to have some photos taking them
the day then I find this a really good
one too that we've got any special
occasions I'll always reach for this and
I say it's quite a good tube for the
hourglass and mineral veil as I was
called the hourglass really expensive
one it's got a bit of a silicone II feel
but not as much as the benefit I'm
really bad remembering product names
today the pore fessional I think it's
called the one in the turquoise tube
similar texture to that but not quite so
silicone e for my base I'm using the
Rimmel match perfection foundation if
you guys have watched my videos I've
read my blog for a little while you'll
know how much of a fan I am like this
one I use it all the time as like an
everyday and also for a special
occasional foundation pretty similar to
a very expensive hourglass products the
coverage is really good on this so great
if you want a little bit more coverage
and I find that it does give a lovely
airbrushed finish so great in autumn if
you just want to have a really flawless
face so I'm just dotting it on and then
I'm going to use my zoeva soap finish
foundation brush pop oh geez it's really
dirty I've not had time to clean my
brushes before this video I also find
this one really quick and easy to
blendin some foundations especially
thicker ones can just take forever to
blend but this one it just does not give
any lines or anything like that it's
just super quick and easy to bend in
I take it all the way down my neck
because especially in winter sometimes
my face on my neck can be slightly
different colors because I do you've
gradual tan and fake tan quite regularly
at the moment I'm really loving the
Beatty Liberata fabulous tan gives a
really nice color but I don't use on my
face so sometimes I get a little bit of
different coloration so it's important
to really bring the foundation down to
the neck this brush I find really good
because it's like a buffer and a blender
all-in-one so it really gives quite
flawless lovely finish which is what I'm
after today next I'm going to use the
collection lasting perfection concealer
under my eyes and on some areas of
redness I've got around my chin I think
it's just kind of hormonal spots but
they tend to be a bit of scarring like a
few days after the spots actually gone
so I'm going to dab some of this on
that's really unhygenic I should
definitely done hump my finger buzz and
under my eyes and then the first thing I
do is blend with my finger and then I go
in with a brush afterwards
before the area I'm HN I'm gonna use the
same brush as my foundation just four
major blending purposes but because that
brush is too big for the under eye area
I'm going to use my zoeva bamboo one one
zero face shaped brush which is
obviously a little bit smaller and
better for the under eye area I use
mostly a tapping motion and I find that
this just helps it sink in and blend
with the foundation a little bit more
seamlessly and if I have any left on the
brush and I'll somehow stab it over my
eyelids which acts as a little bit of a
primer and helps my eyeshadow have a
more even base I feel like I want a
little bit more coverage on my cheeks so
I'm going to apply it a tiny bit more at
my Rimmel match perfection just onto the
back of my hand about a third of the
amount that I used before
dotting you onto the cheeks and then I'm
going to go back in with my foundation
brush and blend that this time I'm using
more of a dabbing motion instead of a
blending motion because I want it to be
a little bit higher coverage so now that
I'm happy with the coverage of my base
I'm going to use one of the new H&amp;amp;M
beauty products and this is their
perfectionist finishing powder if you
saw my haul video you may know that I
wasn't sure about the texture of it but
then I wrote in the blog post review
that actually I judged it too soon it's
actually a really lovely texture gives a
really nice finish so I'm gonna use my
Real Techniques this is the ginormous
what is it called just the powder brush
all over my face just a really light
dusting
and this one has a merit in the lid as
well which is really good so nice if you
want to top it up on that go I don't
even really need to tap off the brush
with this one because it is such a
lovely light finish it's great for just
setting down the foundation before us
starts anything else a bit of d shine as
well and then I'm using a smaller brush
this is one of my Real Techniques bold
metals just in the under eye area
because I didn't want to go too close to
the bigger brush earlier this will
really help to set down my own dry
makeup because we don't want that going
anywhere throughout the day now that my
base is set I'm going to be using the
fairy M chisel cheeks contour kit just
to give a little bit of cheekbone action
I'm gonna start by using the middle
shade I think this one's a little bit
too dark for what I'm after today so I'm
going to use the middle shade on my Real
Techniques contour brush and tap that
off because don't want it to be too
intense and then I'm gonna suck my
facing so that I figure out where my
cheekbones are
okay and then I'm going to go in with
the other side as well
I still think it's a little bit
prominent so I'm going to use my powder
brush to sing my knees before I haven't
cleaned it or anything just to blend it
in with my overall base this just helps
it give a slightly more natural look
sings isn't everyday makeup look
next time you use that same shape and
kind of a figure of three movements all
over town face all over my forehead
cheekbone and under my chin this will
help to give the face a little bit of
shape or system north as well and
normally use my Bobbi Brown bronzer
brush but Dexter was showing it earlier
and now I don't know where it is so I'm
just gonna use my portable one this I
think came with a bronzer maybe all the
casings falling off it so it's just in
the gold case now I think this was a
girl and bronzer from ages ago but I'm
just gonna again dab it on the middle
shade and then starting on the forehead
just create a bit of color on my whole
face
next I'm gonna apply some blusher and
I've got two incredible ones from the
HLN beauty range
I've got deep brown which is a powder
blusher and this gorgeous black casing
that's that one all I've got
Kamio Brown until I'm loving the round
blushes for autumn which is a powder
blush in the white casing this look I
think I'm going to use the powder blush
just because I find that cream sometimes
can dislodge the contouring and I'm a
little bit more comfort with powders so
I'm going to use my Bobbi Brown blusher
brush just lightly dab it on this one
it's actually not that pigmented so give
it a good old swirl doesn't really need
quite solid and then apply to the apples
of my cheeks
then with the same brush I'm going to
use the revolution of makeup revolution
in London ultra blush palette now this
is called a blush palette but I actually
find that all of the shades and you can
see there's so many gorgeous shades in
here and they're very marbled a bit like
the hourglass on your lights powder
ambient light blusher and all of them
are absolutely stunning I'm going to use
I think the brownie one again because
I've used a brownie blush but actually
I'm going to use it as a highlighter
because although it has a bit of color
it has a lot of shimmer in it as well
not shimmer as in glitter shimmer but
just highlight shimmer you know what I
mean
and I'm just applying this just over
where my blusher is
and then again I was going to blend
everything in with my powder brush this
just helps everything to work together a
little bit better
the next thing I'm gonna do is sort out
my brows and I'm going to use my very
old and buttered on your brow pencil I
feel like these came out and they were
great and then everybody kind of forgot
about them but as far as budgets my brow
products go I think these are really
super so I'm going to go and shade in my
brows with the annual pencil
so I've come in a little bit closer to
the eyes and the first thing I'm going
to be using is the hmm smokey nudes
palette you again Miocene this in my H&amp;amp;M
beauty haul and is filled with all of
the most beautiful autumnal browns so
I'm going to start with the lighter
shades up on the brow bone and over the
whole of the eyelid and I'm going to use
one of my Too Faced makeup brushes just
to sweep it over the eyelid area
I'm using the lightest shade just under
the actual eyebrow as it helps to
heighten the eyebrow my eyebrows are not
my best point so we just trying to sleep
them away and then using a middle the
middle one here which is slightly pinky
Brown all over the lid and then I'm
going to use one of the new bourgeois
cream to powder ombre healthier
eyeshadows and this is a really lovely
almost pinky brown color is called an
mal Vontae shade zero 4 and again using
the same brush just going to apply this
over just the lid of the eye
I'd say the quality of these is slightly
better than the H&amp;amp;M ones so it's nice to
create a base for the hmm but then I
think it does make a difference to go in
with the bourgeois afterwards even
though they're really similar color I'm
not going to go to having on the eyes
because this look is mostly going to be
about the lips but the next shade that
I'm going to use another bourgeois ombre
matte powder is knock down room this is
shade 0-8 and I'm going to use that
around the crease and blend that over
the lid as well
because I've got a little bit darker
than I intended I'm going to go back to
the hmm palette and use my other lighter
shades just sweep over the general area
so the overall I look is quite a light
smoky Brown eye and I've been using
different combinations of products to
achieve this on an everyday basis but
now I'm going to use my rose gold of
treatment eyelash colors and the new
Rimmel super color 24-hour mascara and
volume and but this mascara basically
because I'm not using any eyeliner I'm
going to go quite heavy with the curling
and the mascara just so the eyes to
balance out the heavy lips it's got a
lovely curved one so you really could
probably get away without using an
eyelash curler but I like you to do both
and then I'm actually going to twist the
brush around and use the underside of it
to really nestled into the lashes to
create more volume on the outer lashes
I find out the codes for this mascara
dry really quickly so you can going with
the second coat almost straightaway
which is great for doing the makeup and
a bit of a rush
there's something about this comb but it
really does separate out all the lashes
so it's great for volume and separate
lashes so depends all kind of look
you're going for but you can create kind
of a dainty girly girl look with this
mascara or a really bold lash and
because I want them to be a bit faster
I'm gonna go in with another coat just
to build up and get some super volume
okay so that's I'd say two and a half
coats of the Rimmel mascara and I think
it looks like quite a dramatic eye look
considering I haven't really got I
haven't got any eyeliner on so I've been
really liking this mascara recently
lasting power is really good from not 24
hour I would say but then I've got a
nasty habit of picking my lashes but
maybe if I didn't pick them it would
last for 24 hours so I've really been
impressed with this one and as far as of
drugstore mascara goes it's definitely
my favorite at the moment and then
finally the lips but before we get
started I'm just going to use this new
sprayed I've been using it was a
recommendation from Becca and she houses
swears by it I used to use the urban
decay but this is just so much cheaper
and it's the revolution Pro fix oil
control fixings face and we give my face
that quick spritz of this before I go in
it with a lipstick it's not got the
nicest smell it's a little bit
chemically but it really works and it
does keep my oily skin in place skin and
oily skin things keeps our makeup in
place and my oiliness in check
throughout the day and it's got rose
gold packaging so no surprise I really
like this one so I've got a couple of
the new Rimmel London lipsticks here I
think they're called with the only one
this is a really new release and it was
their whole makeup revolution is a
revolution now Rimmel Revolution
campaign the shades that I've got here
are 7 10 which is easy does it
and 810 which is one-of-a-kind and 710
is more for brownie red whereas 810 is
more of a burgundy but I haven't really
decided which one I'm going to go for
and I think with this makeup look
maybe the brownie one might be better
but I'm going to use my lip brush to
apply it just to get a little bit more
precision and first I'm going to
use my rumal exaggerated full-color lip
liner as obsessed with this last winter
or at all-time and equally obsessed this
year I've got the shade
Oh eighteen addiction and it's a really
lovely brownie pink so it's quite
similar to my natural lip color but
better so I think that's great for more
basically any kind of lipstick
and then going in with 710 with a lip
liner brush
okay I'm really happy with that I think
this is a lovely shade it's perfect for
everyday wear as a thing the other one
might have been a little bit too
dramatic for an everyday look the
texture of the numeral lipsticks they
feel very Barney when they go on and
there's somewhere in between gloss and
matte and this is definitely not matte
because as you can see there's a bit of
shine going on
I definitely not gloss either because
there's not a huge amount of shine so
really it's just somewhere in the middle
they feel really lovely and texturizing
just like a bomb on the lips but of
course with that barmy texture it means
that staying power isn't amazing I've
definitely had better staying power but
from a drugstore lipstick and the price
and the color range of these really is
spectacular I've been really liking the
new Ringel lipsticks so yeah that was
7/10 easy does it
with the exaggerated lip liner and this
has been a combination which I've been
using quite regularly and sometimes when
I've been mixing it up I've been adding
in the urban decay which I think I
feature in last month's favorites but
that's not a drugstore product so and
great alternative to that one is
definitely this one here by Rimmel and
that's it that was the final step so
this is my complete everyday autumn
everyday - I say that already my
complete everyday autumn makeup routine
using some drugstore products really
hope you found this makeup look useful
and let me know if you recreate this at
home I'd love to see your everyday
makeup looks if there's any products

new things at the moment especially
drugstore after the makeup revolution
brush set in particular I just my eyes
have been reopened - how many amazing
things are available in the drugstore so
