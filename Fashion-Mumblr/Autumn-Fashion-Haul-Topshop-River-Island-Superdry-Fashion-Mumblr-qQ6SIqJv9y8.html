of my joint autumn shopping haul you
guys might have seen in yesterday's
video I did the a sauce part of this
shopping haul so leave a link below in
case you didn't catch that I was gonna
film one ginormous shopping haul but
then I had so many things that I had to
split it up into two videos in today's
video I'm going to be going through the
bits that I got from River Island
Topshop and super dry so sit tight
because this could be a long one so I'm
not going to talk about every product in
too much detail because I don't want
this to be a 20 minute long video
no more rambling let's get started
firstly River Islands and I'm not
usually a journalist or a Ryland fan but
this season they have so many nice
pieces and I picked up firstly this roll
neck with this interesting neck detail
they've split the fabric and then joined
it again in the middle with this little
bow knot bow I was talking about this
little bead detail cameras going really
dark because of the light on the top but
I thought it'd be lovely just something
a little bit different to the usual row
necks in autumn I wear high necks so
often just I'd love to be snuggly and
warm in winter and this one's obviously
got a really nice ribbed fabric feels
nice and cozy within this detail on the
neckline just add a little bit of
interest to it then I picked up this
absolutely gorgeous 4G lay obviously not
real fur there's a game from rumor
island I think this is so stunning this
was sixty pounds which i think is really
good value for a chelate of this
structure it's even got the different
sections in the back which makes it look
more like a real suede or real sheepskin
material the inside is really lovely and
soft again you can see the stitching to
make it look like it's made of real fur
and this is almost like the other side
of the leather coyotes on this side and
the beautiful waterfall beautiful
waterfall detail neckline so it hangs
really beautifully and I already have if
you see my September favorites and a
Dorothy Perkins one which was only 29
pounds but this is just a lot more
substantial and warm and a lot sturdier
than the Dorothy Perkins one even
Hussey's it all zip pockets which is
really handy for me I put like dog
treats in there but I guess you probably
just put your phone or some coins in
that then I picture up this skirt from
River Island I still
not completely decided as to whether I
love it or not but it's a gorgeous whiny
kind of Oxford color and it's got a
couple of different photo animal skin
textures on it you've got like a
snakeskin and an alligator print both in
this gorgeous oxblood color it's quite
short so I think it'd be one that I
would wear with black tights in the
winter but I really like the colors and
it's got almost like a chevron pattern
on it so undecided this one was 30
pounds so it wasn't too expensive but
yeah I'm just not sure if I will wear a
skirt like this in autumn but I'll try
it on and you guys let me know in the
comments if you think I should keep it
or not the next shop that I went into
was Topshop and the first thing that
caught my eye was this gorgeous handbag
obviously it does look a little bit like
Cloe handbags but I thought you know
different enough to not be another Chloe
fruit tube it's also a lot bigger than
the Chloe jute handbag CC this was 30
pounds and I think it's got lots of room
inside this will definitely fit my
camera my purse my oyster card my makeup
all the daily essentials and it's a
really lovely shape it's definitely
still a saddlebag shade it's got this
leather detail on the strap on the
shoulder area which makes it a lot more
comfortable because the nose I find with
the chains it tends to like dig into
shoulder which is never fun and then
this gorgeous tassel detail on the clasp
which is really pretty inside we have
got just one pocket one zipper pocket so
you can keep your valuables in there and
then you've got a magnetic closure so
it's quite easy to open and close it so
absolutely love this and I think for 30
pounds this is a really good buy they
did have this in a couple of other
colors I think there was a light pink
and beige one although I think it had a
different texture up here it may be like
a snakeskin texture there was a wine and
black one which was really lovely and
also I think there was a pure beige and
maybe even a cream and olive color but I
might have made that up either way I'll
leave links down below if you would like
to grab yourself remand these or just
see what other colors are available next
from Topshop and I don't seem to have a
hanger for this one but it says plain
white t-shirt which is from Topshop
boutique I think oh it doesn't say
boutique on the label but it's very cool
like exposed ripped seams it's like you
know that fabric that hasn't been
finished properly so you have the
fraying effect and I thought
just a winter t-shirt really nice the
larynx it's very simple the sleeves have
been finished properly so it's only
fraying around the neckline but it's a
lovely v-shaped neck and you've got a
little breast pocket over there kind of
normal length you know it won't be too
cropped or revealing and then you've got
this lovely double seam open seam detail
on the back which i think is really nice
it's 100% polyester which means that it
probably will be quite good when you put
it in the wash and you won't have to
imagine e.i in it which is great because
I find anything with too much cotton
content tends to get a little bit
creased and I never really bother time
things probably so but this polyester is
great this is definitely going to be one
that picks up lots of makeup marks like
this and have you really careful not
wearing too much makeup on my neck when
I wear this one then another white top
from Topshop this one is a slightly
thicker fabric it's quite hard to
describe this this pattern it's almost
like a raised raised threads on it
really hard to describe arch I'm going
close up and then the sleeves are almost
like a bell sleeves they're going with
that whole seventies trend at the back
it's quite open so you've got a keyhole
detail here and then this is a wide open
pleat which i think is really lovely
again that's got a high neck so it could
be really nice to wear with familes or
something if you're that way inclined
like I am showing Windsor and the game
really lovely thick material so I think
I'll get quite a lot of use out of this
one in the autumn and find you from
Topshop and you might have already seen
this if you follow the outfit the day
post on my blog
it says gorgeous coat it's incredibly
sixties style is a trench coat with a
waist belt but this pattern is so cute
it's basically a oxford color an oxford
color with these pink flowers all over
it I just look so retro at 70s 60s very
Chloe when you wear it and the colour I
think for blondes and brunettes just
absolutely beautiful
again that's got a sippy pocket so you
can keep any coins in there and the
waist spot means it can be really
flattering it's not it hasn't got holes
in it you just instead pull it through
this ginormous buckle so that it's the
right shape for you I'll link the outfit
of the day post that I did with this
jacket as well down below because I
think it looks so much better on and
when you pair it with the right kind of
outfit and then the final shop that I
went into
was super dry and I pick it up loads and
loads of essentials to autumn so bear
with me because this could be a long one
the first thing in the bag is this
incredibly beautiful tartan dress so
it's a princess do call a princess yeah
it's a princess and neckline and it does
stay in place even though doesn't have
any straps it's got a really kind of
elastic detail at the back so it fits
fits really beautifully it's quite short
so again another one to wear with tights
during the winter but it's the fabric
that I fell in love with it's an almost
one fabric this gorgeous navy in green
tartan and I think in winter like I was
saying earlier I actually like icing in
like a sauce cool I don't really have
many autumn winter dresses and just sort
this one you know when I go somewhere
like nice pub lunches by the open fire
or to friends houses I thought this
would be really lovely and the office
end the scale for slobbing around at
home I picked up these leggings these
have got a really cool waistband is gray
with neon pink super dry and then this
print I guess it's called a ferret I'll
print it but it always just reminds me
of skiing and like ski jumpers and
knitwear it's very tight so they're
going to be like obviously a slim fit
they're not going to be baggy and there
are nice and light material I have I
have more actually at the moment these
ones from Jack Wills but there are more
of a thick woolly fabric and I just get
so hot in them these were $24.99 and
they feel like really lovely qualities I
think this is great value
I'm definitely know I get a lot of use
out of those then I got a jumper super
try have the best jumpers they're always
so warm and snuggly and they're absolute
classics as well so you can they're not
that expensive but I mean this one was
44 pounds but you just know that it's
never going to go out of fashion so this
is a gray one with a lovely simple knit
detail very thick wool not much detail
on it to be honest it's got quite a nice
pattern on the front not sure if you can
see that and a funnel neck let me have a
look at the fabric content so this is
acrylic cotton and wool so you know that
this is going to be really warm that
blend of fabrics is always just really
toasty and because it's long sleeve and
high neckline you can put loads of
layers underneath it it's really soft as
well I find if there's any more wool
content in a jumper it coming a little
bit itchy but this is seriously snuggly
and soft that's the back I just showed
you but yeah clasp like a gray jumper I
know I'll get tons of
that one this winter and then a slightly
more fun jumper I got this one because
it's such a gorgeous coloring this again
is a classic kind of knit pattern on it
but it's in an ombre pastel color pink
at the bottom yellow green blue and
lilac I thought this was gorgeous such a
fun version of a classic winter jumper
again this one was 54 pounds so not mega
cheap but not expensive by any means for
a jumper so pretty and this is a really
lovely fit as well it's quite long so if
you wanna wear with leggings or
something it'll look really cute I also
got a standard pair of they're grey
jogging bottom the slash leggings that
have got pink Superdry logo quite subtly
on the side I don't really like it when
they have the ginormous logos but this
little subtle one I'm okay with and
again a really lovely soft material such
a classic design I have I have only
probably got one other pair of jogging
bottoms and they're so old they're
starting to get like pockets on the
knees I think again they're Jack Wills
and yeah the quality isn't great they
don't have any pockets so they want me
any baggy hip a trim going on which is a
bonus because he released all stuff in
their tracksuit bottoms anyway so yeah I
love these they've got a cuff at the
bottom which means they'll be a nice
tight fit so I really like it when
they're flared at the bottom they just
pick up dirt which is never good
especially when you have to take the dog
out on the lawn every hour or so
another classic jumper from super dry
this one's got some gorgeous button
detail on the shoulders and again a
beautiful play knit pattern this is a
cream color and it's got flexor Brown in
it which just gives it a little bit of
interesting detail it's very stretchy
material this will be really lovely
flattering fit and it's got a roll neck
as well so super snuggly if I go skiing
this winter this will definitely be
coming with me they'll be worn I'm sure
and all the rugby games it's just a
classic jumper can't go wrong with that
I didn't even realize super to I had
this kind of stuff so I just went a
little bit crazy when I went in that
recently another jumper this one's a
little bit lighter in feel it's a very
loose knit very fine it's quite holey if
that makes sense
so it's not the warmest but I thought
really nice when you've got the heating
on and if you just want to have
something a little bit looser on not too
hot and stuffy but because the fabric
which is which is nylon acrylic and
mohair you know this is going to be
really warm it's really lovely and soft
as well and again just
classic genre I mean you can't go wrong
with the scoop-neck
white jumper and then the last wintry
thing that I've picked up from super dry
it was this hairband so it's got this
really cute detail at the back is kind
of like knitted section and fur bit at
the front you guys know what these look
like on they're just really cozy that
looks really stupid but no they look
really lovely on and then perfect for
you for just nipping out you don't want
to ruin your hair with a hat but you
don't your ears or your head to get
called so this was this was $19.99 I
think for the quality of this I've not
seen any better priced one like the ones
on the high street the Topshop ones
don't feel anywhere near as soft as this
when Topshop bring them out this one
just feels much better quality
absolutely love this so that is it that
is everything my bed by now is just
covered in clothes so I hope you enjoyed
going through this haul with me I can't
wait to start wearing all these items I
almost can't wait for it to get a little
bit cooler so that I can start wearing
them all I really hope you guys enjoyed
