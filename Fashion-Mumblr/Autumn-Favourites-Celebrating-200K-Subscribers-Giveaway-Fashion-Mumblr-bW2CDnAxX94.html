me for today's video we are in a very
chilled out and different environment
today because I left my camera on the
tooth the other day let's not talk about
it because it really stresses me out
but that's why were in the lounge on my
vlogging camera for today's video so I'm
going to be sharing with you kind of I
guess a half-yearly favorites because
I've been I'm really bad youtuber this
year and I've not done I don't think
I've done any monthly favorites this
year so I thought it was about time I
shared with you a few products that I've
been really really loving recently and
also just looking in the viewfinder I
realized that I have ticked off every
vlogger cliche in this set up I've got
my cup of tea in my cute Instagram apple
mug I've got my Jo Malone candle I've
got my flowers and I've got on my war
table could not be more cliche blogger
right now um and also within this video
I'm going to be doing a giveaway for
200,000 subscribers which is a milestone
that I never really changed to be
possible it was always my goal to get a
hundred thousand subscribers and even
that seemed a million miles away so to
reach 200,000 is just beyond my wildest
dreams so to say thank you for
subscribing and for sticking with me I
have got an epic giveaway so actually
every single thing that I'm going to
mention in this video everything that
I've been loving this year I'm going to
give away to one of you lucky folks so
stay tuned to hear how to win so I'm
gonna get started with my favorite lip
combination at the moment so I have been
wearing this lip combination now for
maybe a month or so and I've been
altering it a little bit but normally
just go back to this combo first of all
I have been really loving lip liners
this year past few months especially
every single day I've been applying a
lip liner I find it makes a really big
impact on my lip look and my current
favorite is this one it's from the
Victoria Beckham for Estee Lauder
collection and it is her I think that's
probably only one actually it's just oh
one Victoria beautiful nude color and I
will insert a close-up just very very
versatile and I find a perfect nude for
me and I have been wearing that weird
Tom Ford lipstick this is in the shade
sable smoke
it's a beautiful brownie pink no
surprises I don't really bury my
lipstick look that much but this is just
a perfect shade towards the end of
summer I started wearing this and it's
gonna take me right through to autumn
it's quite a barmy consistency as well
so especially if your lips get a little
bit dry in the autumn months you don't
want anything that's too matte this is
just the perfect formula and because
it's Tom Ford there's just something so
beautiful about the formula the color
just yeah absolutely beautiful so that
is my dream lip combination that I have
been wearing for the past few weeks and
I can see myself wearing for the near
future as well my next favorite is my
laptop case so I didn't have a case on
my laptop for a long time and I didn't
want it to get scratched so I looked
into some cases this one is very
affordable it's from a website called
coconut lane and who I actually have a
discount code for I'll leave on the
screen now I think it's trying to keep
scent off this gets so many questions
whenever its limp start on my Instagram
stories you guys are really curious
about it and so that's where it's from I
just think it's very visual very blogger
and no blogger cliche but I actually
love it and it's protecting my laptop
and very affordable so love that that's
been a favorite thing for the past few
months my next favorite is a skincare
favorite and I have loved these in the
past and I still love them so much they
are the advanced ceramide capsules from
Elizabeth Arden
I had these about a year ago they ran
out and I just had almost too many
things in my night skincare routine to
replace them I did not realize how much
I missed them until I got them back in
my life these are if you've not tried
these they're like little gold capsules
of skin cat heaven you just pop the
twist it through into your hand and then
it's like a serum you apply it before
your evening moisturizer and it is the
most incredible texture it's like a
silky okay don't worry if you catch a
key it's like a beautiful silky serum
just leaves the skin feeling very
radiant and very nourished and they are
just a pleasure to apply I also love
that they are these little capsules you
can put them in your overnight bag just
choose however many evenings of going
away for really really handy and just
great for the skin
great for that added boost of radiance
at this time of year especially I have
also been obsessed with the Loreal LV
extraordinary oil multi used farm so my
hair needs deep conditioner I love so
many deep conditioning masks but this is
one I'm using at the moment and I
decided to include this in my favorites
because of all of my favorite masks this
one is I feel the best of value because
price compared to how well it works I
think is absolutely fabulous the smell
is amazing if you've used anything from
the extraordinary oil range before
you'll know how great it smells and if
your hair is dry damage just needs a
little bit more nourishment then it's
generally really really good for that
so I thought I would include that one
next up I couldn't not mention this
every time I wear this someone
compliments my complexion or my skin and
it's down to this this is the bare
minerals bare Pro performance wear
liquid foundation and I've been getting
a few questions and vlogs as to what
foundation I've been wearing and it is
whenever I get complimented on my
foundation it's this this is a fairly
high coverage I'm wearing at the moment
and what I love about it the most is
that it actually has good skincare
benefits to it so it actually improves
your skin as you wear it which is
incredible as with so many bare mineral
products it just has so many skin loving
ingredients and that but it also makes
the skin look amazing on the day that
you apply it as well so I just use a
pump with this my Beauty Blender blends
in really quickly gives me a great
coverage and it lasts 24 hours as well
or it lasts me the whole day even when
I'm in the city out of meetings I just
rely on this and love it and highly
highly recommend it
obviously with things like this the
winner of the giveaway will get to
choose their own shade and then I'll
gone by and send you the right shade so
you won't be stuck with my shade which
is sandstone 16 if you're not the same
skin color as I am my next favorite is
my Aspen or chunk bag I have been
wearing this for the past 3 weeks I'd
say pretty much a non-stop this bag
really surprised me when I first chose
it I I knew that I'd like it but I
didn't realize just how much I would
grow to really love this bag it's
surprisingly roomy it does actually fit
most of my stuff in there including my
vlogging camera phone purse lipstick
mirror camera charger phone charger that
kind of thing
so Rumi wise it's really impressed me
but also it just really completes an
outfit I feel like it's such a statement
piece it elevates so many different
types of outfits and especially at this
time of year when often we're bundled up
and outerwear and our coats in our bags
are really the two main things you see
in an outfit it's nice to have more
statement piece which this really is I
always think of astronaut also as a very
much a designer brand or sea of luxury
British brand but the price points
aren't crazy like mulberry or saline or
Louboutins so for that reason as well
I'm a huge fan of it a lot more
accessible this is not the exact one
that I'm giving away in the giveaway I'm
actually giving away because I feel like
that's quite a love it or hate it bag
this one it's the one that I am going to
be giving away a little bit more lovable
for many different preferences this
beautiful pink bag brand-new the school
just pink leather I'm not sure the exact
name of the start of this one but a very
very practical handbag which i think is
absolutely gorgeous
silver hardware chain strap so I'll let
you know how to win this a little bit
later on gonna keep you waiting a little
bit longer
next up the maintaining eight hand
during the autumn months I have been
using the tan looks the face
illuminating self tan drops in with my
serum in the mornings so whether I go on
holiday in a natural town or whether
I've been fake tanning I find that my
face just doesn't tan the same as my
body so I really have to maintain it a
little bit more frequently this I find
so easy to integrate into my daily
skincare routine at the moment and for
the past year or so I've been using a
dark on serum which you'll know from
many of my other skincare videos and I
just been putting a couple of drops of
this into the dolphin serum and after
just a couple of days it gives you a
beautiful natural tan on the face just
make sure you wash your hands afterwards
I have forgotten on a few occasions and
had rather bad fake tan hands I love how
this smells I love how this works in
with my skincare routine it's very
versatile and it gives a great color so
that's a big big favourite for the past
few months and then another Beauty
favorite is the L'Oreal Paris paradise
ecstatic mascara this
is beautifully packaged in rose gold
packaging it has castor oil within the
formula so it's actually nourishing the
lashes as well which I really like
because I had lash extensions I like
anything that's going to help them not
that they fell out but anything that's
just gonna help them grow even stronger
but most importantly when I apply it it
makes my lashes look great
I don't wear eyeliner so I do need nib
scar that's quite dramatic so this one
just works perfectly for that I just
call my lashes do a couple of coats of
this and gives great lashes at last okay
and last but not least two more fashion
favorites again I don't expect you guys
to love exactly the same pieces that
I've chosen so I'll be giving away a
Topshop voucher and an Asus voucher so
that you can choose what you want from
those retailers but my personal
favorites have been this corduroy skirt
or cord skirt from ASOS the color of
this I adore and gets so nice to be able
to wear a skirt in the autumnal months
this I've been wearing with my Cloe
boots with over knee boots so many
different styles and I think it's quite
an autumnal pink the shade alone I just
adore I've been styling this with a
jumper most recently with a Reece rib
jumper I did a whole blog post on this
outfit actually says so in love with it
so I'll leave that blog post link down
below you can check that out for some
styling tips but this I've been loving
and wearing a lot and then last but
absolutely not least is this dress from
Topshop this dress really took me by
surprise I was not expecting to fall
quite so in love with it as I did I
don't normally wear black so this is
very very dark for me but it does have
pink flowers which is what shirts me
drew me to it again when I wear this I
received so many compliments and one of
my friends even bought it on her phone
down there and as soon as she saw me
wearing it which is always a really good
sign but yeah I've been loving wearing
this really surprised me how much I love
it and it's one of those pieces that it
is your entire look so you don't need to
worry about what top to pair with what
jeans because this dress is such a great
statement piece that is pretty much an
outfit all-in-one so those are all the
pieces I have been loving for the past
few months and as I mentioned you guys
