joining me for today's video which is
going to be an autumnal haul from a few
of my favorite retailers including Reis
Club Monaco all saying it's whistles to
name a few and these are all pieces that
I've been picking up over the last I'd
say six weeks or so because they are
slightly more higher-end they're kind of
what I like to call premium high street
they are not the kind of thing that I
obviously have bought all in one go
because they do have slightly higher
price points and because of that they
are more considered purchases and I
would say that these are really some
investment pieces for autumn so I've
tried to pick out some pieces that
aren't particularly trend led they're
more classic pieces that I know I'm
going to get loads and loads of use out
of both this autumn and autumns to come
in future years
so I'm going to get started by talking
about the jumper that I'm wearing now
because I just know that I will forget
about it if I don't talk about it now
and this one is a very plain baby pink
jumper and it's a cashmere jumper from
ASOS and I was actually really surprised
when I saw this on ASOS it was in their
premium section because I don't usually
sports cashmere things on a sauce but
they're premium section is actually
really really lovely and this is just a
very plain high-neck jumper and it goes
down to a ribbed detail down at the
bottom there's no design detail to it
it's just really really classic and
already I've worn this so so so much
it's such a classic piece I adore the
color it's so soft
and so warm as well right now and that's
you roasting it's cold outside but it is
sunny so yeah it's a really lovely warm
piece as I said fantastic for layering
can definitely fit my thermal underneath
this and be super toasty and just very
elegant very ladylike and yeah really
really like this this was 99 pounds so
quite expensive I think I picked up on
one of the 20% off day so I ended up
paying eighty into my pants yeah I feel
like I saved a little bit of money on
this but still an expensive piece so I'm
praying it's not gonna bubble I have
worn and wash it a few times and so far
it is lasting fairly well so I'm up
about this and so far really really
pleased with the purchase the next few
pieces in my pile of things to show you
are from Reese and I got these before
Fashion Week's they were definitely
bought with Fashion Week in mind this
one is a semi sheer blouse and I find
white shirts white blouses are just the
kind of thing that you need in your
wardrobe you need a lovely one in your
wardrobe and this is certainly not going
to be going out of style anytime soon
it's a little bit different to your
usual blouse in that the material is
lovely and sheer and then you've got
this beautiful ruffle detail going about
two-thirds of the way down and all
around the collar as well so a really
beautiful ladylike detail very elegant
and feminine and I've been wearing this
tucked into some clots I've also been
wearing it with jeans and I get
compliments on it most times that I wear
it it's just a lovely fit you can tell
that it is a premium high-street piece
because there's just something about the
tailoring with rece pieces that just
look so so so lovely I've got a size 8
which is bigger than what I would
usually get because I found it quite
narrow on the shoulders but the size 8
does fit me really really well and this
is just such a classic piece I'm now
going to get tons and tons of use out of
next from Reese you may have already
spotted this and a few of my vlogs
because I have been wearing it most days
is this absolutely beautiful coat let me
take the ether bit off this coat is
something I'd actually had my eye on for
many many years ever since I worked in
Reese and it's one of the designs that
they kind of alter every years they
bring out something like this every
single year just a few design details
were different and in previous years
when I tried them on they'd always been
too big for me and I don't know if maybe
I've broadened out or briefs have made
their size is slightly more petite but I
tried this on really optimistically this
year and was so so happy when it fit me
I think looking at it does look a lot
more narrow than most of their designs
but it is just such a beautiful at shape
and inserts a clip of me wearing it now
it fits the figure so beautifully it is
so feminine and it's such a lovely
quality inside you've got this piping
detail along with the bottom edge and
then you've got this lovely lining there
are some very slim invisible pockets
although it does tend to ruin the fit if
to ruin the silhouette effect for
anything in them there's also a belts
which cinches into giving you a really
lovely waist and I took honest I always
do this up I always do the buttons up
most coats I don't but this just fits so
beautifully when it's done up properly
so I've been such such such a fan of
this coat and this is going to be my
going out and smart occasion coat
throughout the rest of winter and I
really want to take good care of it and
hope that will last for many winters to
come
I also saw this on the mannequin I think
in store window with the coat and this
is a faux fur scarf or stole and I
thought the colors looked so fabulous
together it's a kind of gray liner color
that's probably the best way to describe
it and while I don't wear it on the skin
so it doesn't give me direct month it
just looks so lovely it really elevates
this jacket makes it look even smarter
even more luxurious and I also tuck the
first scarf into the belt so keeping
that lovely feminine shape and I just
love this combination so so much as it
was Reese it was obviously a little bit
more pricey than a lot of high street
coats but I think a coat is something
that obviously is you wear on the
outside it's what people see during
autumn winter it is something I'm really
glad I invested in I think you guys are
gonna be seeing me wearing this
combination a lot in upcoming vlogs so
now you know where it's from as always
all product links are gonna be down
below in case you wanted to shop from
any of these purchases or look in some
in a little bit more detail all be
linked in the description box down below
another one from Reese and this is a
beautiful high neck sleeveless ribbed
top just trying to tuck in the hanging
bits this is a gorgeous baby pink color
I just love wearing pastels in autumn
winter I love wearing pastels all year
and who says that autumn has to be for
dark colors I just saw this is
absolutely beautiful
once again I've been wearing this of
jeans with culottes as well and I think
it also look really sleek with like a
black leather pencil skirt if I was
still working in an office environment
it would definitely be something that I
would wear with a leather
perhaps once again beautiful quality I
think this one was around 80 pounds not
too short can't remember was a little
while ago but yeah once again all
details be linked down below so that's
another lovely essential for autumn
winter and then I keep mentioning
collapse
so no surprise that my final thing from
Reece is a pair of qalaat this is a pair
of grey trousers they come down to well
just above the ankle for me really
because I have a bit of surety they've
got a really lovely peak detail here
which gives them a really nice
silhouette they hang really really
beautifully they have once again got
invisible pockets and some pocket detail
on them back in to do them up I think I
got these in the size four I did I went
for the smallest size in these because
with culottes you don't really want too
much access materials I think if you're
wondering which size to go for then I'd
say go down with clots because you don't
want too much material gathering around
the waist area these again the material
is such lovely quality I think they are
dryclean only which is the only pangs I
do end up spending a fortune on
dry-cleaning bills in the autumn time
but so so worth it so elegant really
good for work if you work in a smart
office environment and still want to
look stylish and these look fabulous
with a pair of lovely shoes because they
do swing above the ankles it frames a
pair of lovely shoes really really
nicely so I wore these to the GHD dinner
at the rosewood Hotel in my Valentino's
I wore them at Fashion Week with some
resuce which I totally forgot to bring
downstairs but I will insert a clip of
them now because they should also
included the shoes in this hall there
are really beautiful classic baby pink
I'd say almost like a grey pink suede
pair of shoes pointy toe with lovely
straps that mean that they don't slip
around on the feet and yeah I wore those
shoes with these houses as well and
there's such a lovely classic pair of
shoes go with so many things so another
really good investment piece for the
Wardrobe another of my absolute favorite
stores in the premium end of the high
street is Club Monaco and I'm so so so
thrilled that we have one on Kings Road
there's also on a Westbourne Grove
that's a little bit far away from me
I do tend to get a little
spendy then I go to the US because I
find it a tad cheaper although with the
exchange right now it's probably not
that much cheaper but I went into the
kingsroad store recently and I did get a
little bit spendy one of the first
pieces that I added to my basket was
this and it's a plain but also fairly
unusual gray cashmere jumper this is
definitely a piece I knew I'd get tons
of wear out of so I wasn't too upset to
paying the price and it was I think it
was I think it was over 200 pounds so it
was not a cheap piece but it is a
classic gray jumper but the sleeves are
a little bit unusual so they go in at
the top and then in at the bottom and
then they almost balloon out a little
bit in the middle section you'll see
what I mean in the cutout but I really
like that design detail it makes it just
a little bit more special than a plain
gray jumper this neckline with the high
kind of cowl-neck makes it so so snuggly
I am of course really really conscious
of getting makeup on it so I'm always
super duper careful and it's just a
lovely great mouth
such a lovely flattering gray color a
lovely light gray and once again I'm
worn and washed this a few times even
though it's dryclean only I have
actually put it in my washing machine on
the delicate wool setting and it's been
fine and yeah not showing any signs of
wear which I'm thrilled about because I
don't want it to start looking tatty but
yes once again another piece are we
wearing tons this autumn and winter so a
really lovely investment piece from Club
Monaco when I went into the Club Monaco
store they actually were holding their
summer sale and they had a few pieces
that were in my opinion really good
value so this one was down from 270
which I would not have paid for cardigan
280 once a really really good discount
still not cheap for cardigan but it's
just so cute with this ruffle detail
down at the bottom I thought it just
made it really unusual and I personally
just love cardigans I find them so nice
for putting around your shoulders
especially in the late summer in the
evenings when you don't want to put a
jumper on so it's just too much but a
cardigan is a lovely way to keep the
chill off this is the kind of thing that
are we taking on airplanes with me and
on summer holidays and winter Sun
holidays because it is such
your piece of putting around your
shoulders and keeping the shell off and
such an easy thing to throw over so many
outfits as well
I love the ruffles they just give it
such a lovely feminine edge and it's a
classic white shade so really easy to
match with your outfit so this is one
that I'm really really glad I picked up
in the sale it's timeless it's not going
out of style anytime soon and really
really lovely and cozy so they're really
really happy with that purchase from a
club at Monaco this next one also from
Club Monaco is one of my favorite things
I've purchased in a long long time
excuse the bright sunlight and this
really reminds me of a ballerinas
cardigan it reminds me the kind of thing
I used to wear over my little tutu and
leotard when I used to play play ballet
do ballet practice ballet which is a
long long time ago and it is a cashmere
cardigan and yet you wear it as a top so
you don't really you can wear it as a
cardigan but I've been wearing it
recently as a top so you have this
crossover detail and then a belt to
really cinch in the waist and then the
bottom material is cut a different way
so it almost so it almost puffs out like
a tutu which is just such a lovely
design detail this one again like the
jumper is a very beautiful light grey
really flattering on all the skin tones
I think and because it's cashmere is so
lovely and soft it looks so luxurious it
feels so luxurious and I get so many
compliments when I wear this it's such a
classic piece another one I'm really
glad that I've now got to my wardrobe
because it's just so so lovely I
honestly love this to bits and yes
gonna get so much wear out of this this
autumn and winter and the final piece of
knitwear from Club Monaco is this
absolutely gorgeous chunky white knit
jumper and this is actually the reason
why I went into the store because I saw
this on the mannequin and totally fell
in love with these amazing sleeves so as
you guys in those sleeve detail and
ruffles in particular are so on-trend
this autumn and to be honest I love them
so much so even if they're not in China
next door to I'm still gonna wear them
because this just looks so so gorgeous
on it is so thick and warm
it's definitely a really good quality
wool in fact let's have a look what kind
of Wallis's so it's a hundred percent
extra fine merino wool and I'm not
surprised because it is oh so so soft
the neckline is just really easy to wear
once again you can layer you can put
warm layers underneath it's a
long-sleeved which which is great
because you can put your thermal on I
roll the sleeves up sometimes if I'm
writing or you know there are quite long
so you can roll them up which looks
great but these ruffles are just such a
gorgeous design detail they're really
quite statement but because it is just a
white jumper it's also really easy to
wear so such a nice thing to have in
your wardrobe to be a part of this trend
but without going too overboard just so
so wearable and I just love it I love
everything that I picked up from Club
Monaco so much in fact everything from
this haul I'm just really really pleased
with as I said when I shop from premium
high street shops I have to really
really love the piece because they are
such investment pieces and I can safely
say I love everything in this haul so
let me carry on and just finish this
lovefest right here before I get a
little bit crazy the final piece from
Club Monaco is not knitwear it is
actually a slimmer piece another one
that I picked up from their summer sale
and it's this absolutely gorgeous play
suit you might recognize this from my
Instagram or from my Greece video
because I actually went to Club Monaco a
few days before going to Greece so I
wore this a heck of a lot it is a really
lovely material which fits the body
absolutely beautifully because it has
got this body fitting shape to it along
zip along the back but then you have
these ruffled capped sleeves and then
you can see at the back the ruffles just
continue down into FAQ which is so so so
beautiful this is once again the kind of
thing that I'll be taking on all my
holidays that are coming up it's so
gorgeous it's the lovely lightweight
material so you don't get too hot but
it's still nice and covering so if it's
not like the heat of the day if it is
the evening then it still is plenty of
material to keep you nice and snug it's
got the pockets which just make it a lot
more cute and casual the print I adore I
think white and blue is such a classic
style
combination for Greek collar days or
more exotic holidays just absolutely
love it really really pleased with this
and I think I got it about half price in
the sale - so a nice little bargain and
something that are we wearing for many
many summers to come okay and I just
have a few more pieces to show you two
more bits of knitwear and also a bikini
so I wanted to include this because it
is a higher-end piece this is a bikini
that you guys went crazy for on my
Instagram and I actually included it in
my September favorites that you may have
already seen it apologies if so but it's
from a brand called Marysia which is a
Polish brand that's stocked on
net-a-porter and a few other places
one's gonna leave it down below but I
bought this from net-a-porter I just
absolutely love the shape of this the
top I find really flattering considering
that I am fairly flat-chested this style
just works really really well for me and
then the bottoms are also high waisted
so it covers any bits you don't
necessarily want to be on show
personally I don't really like having my
hip kind of area too much on show
because it's not my favorite body part
so because this covers it makes me feel
so much more confident in a bikini
I felt that I would rather spend my
money on one lovely bikini that I know
I'm gonna love for a long long time
instead of spending like forty pound
here forty pound now so to come here and
they're on loads of different bikinis I
didn't love so you will be seeing me
wearing this in a lot of upcoming
holidays but yeah I don't mind because
it's so gorgeous
I love how I look in this and I think
that's quite rare to love how you look
in a bikini I think no one's ever really
happy with their body no makini well if
you are then good for you but I actually
feel comfortable in this bikini which is
worth a lot more to me than what I spent
on it so yes that definitely justified
the spend for me and it was not cheap it
was I can't even tell you too much from
bikini let's just say that so this is a
really lovely relaxed knitwear piece
that I picked up from All Saints and I
would definitely say that All Saints
is a premium high street retailer
because it is more expensive than your
Topshop and your um River Island and
things like that
so this was 118 pounds but it is a
hundred percent merino wool so very
actually a fairly reasonable price tag
from merino wool because yeah the Club
Monaco one was probably double that but
I just thought the color was so so me
it's very similar to clothing I'm
wearing now it's a really lovely slouchy
fit so on those days when you just you
want to look chic but you don't want to
look as though making too much of an
effort this is just absolutely perfect
for that it is so lovely and solved so
warm and it's longer at the back than it
is at the front which just adds to that
really relaxed casual vibe which
personally I'm looking forward to
wearing this when traveling any
long-haul flights I've got coming up
this is going to be absolutely gorgeous
for and it manages to be worn without
being too chunky so a really lovely
layering piece as well
once again not going to be going out of
style anytime soon so this will remain
in my autumn winter wardrobe for many
seasons to come and last but absolutely
not released is a rather lovely jumper
from whistles so this one has this
unusual detail around the waist it
houses not detail these are just two
strands of cashmere basically I think
it's a cashmere jumper let me just
actually check that oh my gosh it's 50%
lane and 50% cotton but they have done a
very good job of making this super super
soft I genuinely thought this was
cashmere so it is actually just a rather
play in a gray jumper but with this
really cool detail which once again it's
just like a really cool casual piece
with a bit of a fun edge to it so I've
really been enjoying wearing this with
white jeans with high / knee boots just
a really lovely way to add a bit of a
twist to a really lovely casual outfit
it just fits the body really nicely as
you'd expect from somewhere like
whistles it just it's been designed
really well so it just fits absolutely
beautifully looks really elegant on and
it's very slim fitting too so if you
just want to be warm but not add a
little bulk to your body then this is a
really really lovely one for that so
I've been wearing this a lot for just
those times and I want to pop out to do
a meeting or something and yeah really
lovely classic
so there's everything that I picked up
recently across the premium end of the
high street a lot of knitwear but of
course it's coming up to autumn winter

of use out of it I'd love to know what
