to basics with my beauty and makeup
routine the choices available to us
aren't overwhelming
new product launches on an almost daily
basis and so sometimes I like to take a
step back simplify my routine and reach
my classic favorite products today I'm
going to show you a classic simple
elegant and flawless makeup look created
with some products that I've been using
a few years from Estee Lauder including
the cult classic double well if you're
starting a makeup collection from
scratch or looking to go back to basics
you can't go wrong with these after
cleansing and toning I apply the wakeup
on its anti-aging gives my skin instant
radiance and brightens the complexion to
and then the classic estee lauder double
wear no matter how many foundations I
try I keep coming back to this one
long-lasting and flawless it's buildable
too so I can always get the amount of
coverage I desired whether that's a
light daytime look or an airbrushed
finish for the evening there are fifty
shades available for double where my
shade is pure beige and today and
building a medium coverage confident
that it will last all day long
it's got 24 hour wear and lasts through
heat and humidity the best part for me
though no chance for my clothes
very important when your wardrobe has as
many lights and lights as mine
next I'm applying some balm no makeup
collection is complete without one and
the pure color Envy blooming lip balm
gives a touch of color - I don't know
about you but my under-eye area is often
in need of brightening Double Wear brush
on glow BB is perfect for this
brightening concealing and highlighting
the under eye area and any other areas
of the complexion in need of some
luminosity it has a hydrating formula
and helps ease any signs of fatigue as
well as blemishes fine lines and
wrinkles I gently Pat it in with my
fingertips to blend brow products or
something I now can't live without and I
like as pencil with a spoolie on one end
to neaten and fill in my brows I use a
brow gel to set them in place and add a
touch of color to
up next from my favorite step bronzer
bronze goddess is another classic
product in my makeup collection I
squeeze my brush to create a soft
contour shape before applying all over
my complexion to give my face a healthy
color I also find the shade to be
perfect for a natural eyeshadow shade so
I apply a delicate wash over my eyelids
for an everyday look
blusher is something I don't use every
day but as we approach spring I love the
flush of color it brings to my face this
rose shade is natural and flattering and
works a day and night too mascara is an
important step I want lots of volume but
no clumps it has to look natural the
sumptuous extreme mascara lifts and
curves my lashes and has a vitamin
complex formula to condition my lashes
to
lip liner is probably not an essential
for everyone but it is for me I don't
leave the house without it this maka
shade is a little deeper than my natural
lip color and so is perfect for
enhancing the shape before applying
lipstick my go-to lipstick for many
months now has been the insatiable ivory
there's not much left of it time for a
new one
it's balmy and comfortable to wear and
the color is so me that's my makeup look
complete a flawless complexion thanks to
Double Wear that will still look great
at the very end of the day
a tenday sample is yours and you visit
your nearest estee lauder counter try it
out for yourself I'll leave all the
information about it
down in the description box by refining
the products I use my application takes
in no time at all
in fact my tea is still piping hot
darlings I really hope you enjoyed my
back to basics makeup routine let me
know in the comments if you like the
idea of stripping back your beauty
collection to the classics
