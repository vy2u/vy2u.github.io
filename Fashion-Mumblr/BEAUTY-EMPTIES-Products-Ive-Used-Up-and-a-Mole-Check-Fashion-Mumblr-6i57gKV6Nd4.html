rainy Monday morning in London but
feeling positive is like I've probably
thought what is the world could umbrella
really find illusion if they actually
got it in a blog about Musa pardon
they're feeling very lucky for that and
I just arrived at bonus tavern I'm
trying before my fuzzy things I found
time to contemplate
okay so I'm back home again I realized
that first 30 seconds of this vlog has
been a bit of a whirlwind but let me
explain what happened this morning so I
went for a couple of meetings and then I
went to a place called let me get this
right new Elio u del u del au which is a
skin care clinic in Rockville and I'm
specially invited there by the team at
La Roche Posay who as you guys know our
skin and kind of Sun specialists and
particularly a huge range of Sun care
and they invited me to go to this clinic
to really have an in-depth look at my
skin and in particular my moles so moles
can sometimes be a little bit tricky
when it comes to sun exposure and it's a
good idea to keep an eye on them make
sure there's no irregularities there's
nothing to worry about
I've actually been trying to get more
appointment for ages and it just seems
current perfect time you know when
something's meant to be like I've been
thinking about getting a mold
appointment and then when that email
came into my inbox I was like yes that
was a sign I needed to go so when this
morning I met the lovely dr. Heba and
she looked at firstly the moles my body
should put some kind of cooling gel on
this moment like the magnifying glass of
microscope type thing and looked at a
few of the moles on my body I've got
quite a lot so she really looked at the
moles of my legs on my chest area and
especially any that looks a little bit
different so a few of them I've had
since birth a few of them kind of
appeared in the last few years some of
them are flats and there were raised
like little Coco Pops quite a morning
person
and but she basically said that none of
them were anything to worry about
and then I flipped so BAM lying on my
phone so she could look at my back and I
feel some really quite big moles on my
back like one of them really is the size
of cocoa popping his 3d once again she
said that was nothing to worry about and
as long as it's not bothering me like
not catching on anything then I
shouldn't remove them because that can
just call us aggravation but there was
one mole where she said I need to keep
an eye on it because
a lot darker than the rest of them on my
back has slightly odd shape and
basically I need to keep measuring it so
get Charlie to measure it and check that
doesn't change so nothing to worry about
but just one to keep an eye on but for
me that's a real peace of mind because I
have been really conscious of my moles
recently and I definitely wanted to have
the opportunity to have them looked at
and so yeah I'm certainly going to keep
an eye on that one if it does change
then I'll be going to see my GP and
hopefully get it taken away or get it
looked at more thoroughly he was also
really interesting to talk to dr.
Cheever about suncream because I say I'm
usually pretty careful and I wear factor
13 my third time try this is very
interesting and the lady was saying that
most the time most people do not put on
anywhere near enough Sun cream yeah I
recommend your being because it takes me
forever throughout it she said that you
need to have a two millimeter layer all
of your skin
most people they did a test with Danish
holidaymakers and seven people were
given a selection of Sun creams
all of them chose factor 15 but the the
amount that they rubbed it in there was
actually only less than quarter of the
recommended sickness on their bodies so
actually they only get in factor 7 all
over the body when they put on factor 50
so that was really interesting so I was
definitely layer up that Sun cream when
I was applying it the back of my hand
she had some La Roche Posay products
including this really lovely lightweight
um one for your face if like me you get
congestion when you put something on
your face maybe try this one I haven't
got it with me but she's kinda gonna
send one over and I was rubbing it on my
hand she said stop like half the time
before I was Natalie stop rubbing it in
she said you need to stop there because
that's the level of sickness that you
need so that was really really
interesting so that's why I got up to
you this morning and I will let you guys
know how I get along with my mole
journey and I'll show you
Kim Karen arrives but all sort of
importance check your skin from an early
age and it's really not worth burning
think of a tan for a few days try and
extra
my two boys so I'm back home now I'm
going to have a productive afternoon the
accountant is coming at 3:00 sometimes
so I guess the rest of these log is
going to be using what a bloggers day
looks like when we're not out and about
I don't think I've done one of these
during every day May so far it's going
to be a admin day a catching-up day I've
got a fresh notebook I used up my last
minute book it's all finished very
satisfying kind of first day of school
feeling what you starting you notebook
going to write my stew list I need to
edit a Maltese video I need to write up
a New York blog post I need to write up
a couple of fashion posts and just
general attack the inbox we are trying
to do tons of things on my student I
need to call the builders to replace the
broken system bit on top of the toilet
so many boring things like that and also
just get my diary organized because feel
like we've got a few trips I haven't
properly planned in my diary it's is
going to be that kind of day so I'll let
you know how I get on
hey guys so it's a few hours later the
accountant has been and gone and wasn't
too painful apparently he's got
everything under control which is good
news there is only so much more to do
when it comes to running your own
business and I ever thought I even the
fact that you have to decide what kind
of v80 you paid you do cash accounting
and you're so company you are so trader
or you blah blah blah there's just so
many things to think about and so much
admin to do honestly I absolutely love
my job but there is so much more to it
than meets the eye people really don't
see the amount of admin and just the the
long and kind of boring things that go
along with running your own company most
small companies have teams to do like
accounting and someone to do invoices
and someone else to do the photography
and the writing and someone else to do
the emails and the undoing as a post but
when you're your own company when you're
a blogger you just have to do everything
not me complaining so they didn't love
it and I wouldn't do it but um yeah
there's a lot more to it than meets the
eye let's just say that so apologies are
the signal of blank in the vlog for five
hours it's now the evening Charlie's
downstairs cooking a Thai green chicken
curry
I got a naan bread from across the road
at the engine so that I'll just make it
even tastier I just came upstairs to the
room which will eventually become my
filming room now it's just a mess
although less of a mess and a husband
in previous vlogs because I have been
skiing but surely taking it and I just
found my bag of empties so I've been
saving my rubbish essentially for the
past I don't know like six to eight
months just like seems I've used up
product wise and it's been just sitting
in the corner of a room for so long so I
thought now as soon as I haven't got
much at all today I'd go through these
products share with you my thoughts on
them I think I've mentioned in previous
empties videos I think I did one like a
year ago and for a blogger to finish
something is a big deal because we do
try a lot of samples we do get to try
new things a lot which means we often
hop from product to product but it's
only when you really really love
something that you add it to your daily
routine
and finish it so it's really a good good
sign of a good product so going to prop
you guys up and go through this bag of
my beauty rubbish right hopefully the
camera is going to stay in place I've
currently just balanced it on a cushion
and a box and the stream is just not
quite ready for proper filming set up
yet first thing in my bag is this it's
the beautiful skin nicely cleansing
water from boots number seven this is a
really affordable my set of water and
it's so gentle I got through it pretty
quickly because the pump actually
dispenses a lot of product and so while
it is affordable I do get through it
very very quickly it's super easy to get
really accessible and yeah great one
from boots doesn't it's isn't in so I
definitely repurchase that one I've got
a lot of micellar waters in this bag and
in my beauty cupboard I buy a lot I get
sent quite a lot as well and very lucky
to receive samples of new ones and so
yeah they'll definitely be a few more my
clear waters in this video yes the next
thing I grabbed it's also my slaughter
this one's from uterine I use this all
throughout the winter it's really
hydrating I think I actually wrote a
blog post on why I love this range the
dur motto cream this is a three-in-one
perfect sensitive skin for all skin
types
again really love this one and this is
definitely my go-to winter night slow
water just is so gentle nourishing and
hydrating got a dry shampoo dismissed
from Moroccan oil and this is probably
one of my favorite dry shampoos I love
the taste as well but the reason why I
love this one so much is because it does
have a slight lie lip tint to it so if
your hair is airing on the yellow side
sometimes and you want to neutralize
those tones then this is a great one
this one is the light tones is the
actual color of this one highly
recommend it for blondes especially if
you do find that you do go a little bit
yellow between turning appointments LMS
total glow bronzing body lotion this is
a fantastic gradual tan I love the co
this gives me it is expensive for a
gradual tan but I was gifted this one I
would repurchase this but I appreciate
that it may not be in everybody's budget
and I do think there are also some
really good budget gradual towns but if
you're not very good at fake tanning if
you don't want to go with a mousse or
gel then a gradual tan
is amazing and this one is pretty much
failsafe so definitely do recommend this
one this is a molten brown room spray in
cocoa and sandalwood this one got a tiny
little drug left I think ah okay this
reminds me of when we have friends over
it kind of reminds me of celebratory
evenings or like evenings of friends
because I would always use like a
Febreze on normal occasions that this
would be our posh room spray so if we've
got anyone coming over where that's
friends or family or the accountant
example I sprayed this I wouldn't say
it's terribly long lasting and but it is
very impactful it probably makes the
room smell amazing for an hour or so but
maybe that's with me getting used to it
but what I do know is that when people
come in the house after I've sprayed
this they always comment on how great it
smells so definitely repurchasing this
one this is a shampoo the pure ology
perfect for platinum if you saw my vlog
yesterday where I got my hair colored
you have seen me picking this one up and
that was me just trying to say this is
my favorite this one has a light blue
color so again really good at
neutralizing any brows tones great if
you have a similar haircuts me anyway
keep it kind of ashy and cool instead of
it really warming up again fairly pricey
but I do love this one and I really like
to switch up my shampoos and
conditioners but I always keep on going
back to this one a body lotion good old
Palmer's cocoa butter I've spoken about
this loads before is such a classic to
be honest and Charlie and I both use
this most evenings I do sometimes switch
into something a bit different if I'm
trying something else but this really is
my go-to I was actually a parmesan buff
of the last year I did quite a lot of
little jobs to them and that was a great
one for me because I just love the
friends so much and yeah you really
can't beat palms cocoa butter and we
have already repurchased quite a few of
these speaking of hair coloring this is
a brand called a photo is called devoted
to hue oh no II someone is the brand and
this is the tinted love so this one is a
color enhancing treatment it is a deep
deep purple so it really is an at-home
toner I also have since it's going to be
in here but the deep conditioner version
of this and I did use a lot of it in a
go like I probably only get four or five
use without the deep conditioner but for
me plunking that all over my hair
really did bring it back to the color
that you get straight after walking out
the salon team that with this and it's
just the most beautiful almost lilac
color really really loved it
haven't repurchase this just because I'm
using one from L'Oreal at the moment
definitely a big fan of this one next up
is a body scrub scrub scrub this is the
Brazilian copassers
scrub in oil I think video I think I
included this in a morning routine video
quite a while ago in a long time since I
finished this oh my goodness I forgot
just how good that smells
in fact smelling that and reminded me
that I do need to research is this I
have got other body scrubs but I just
love the consistency of this one that
actually felt crystals that exfoliate
you so they do melt as you are hot in
the shower which just means you don't
have little grainy bits all over the
bottom of the bust or when you're
finished it smells amazing as I said it
leaves your body so so so soft and
because it's a scrub in oil the oil also
acts as a moisturizer so you could get
away with not using a body lotion
afterwards because you do have that
lovely kind of layer of oil on your skin
after get out the bath I have got no
less than three batiste dry shampoos in
this bag as well as the Moroccan or one
that I mentioned earlier batiste is so
affordable and you really just cannot
beat it when it comes to dry shampoo
personally I use dry shampoo maybe three
or four days a week I use it to really
refresh my style I don't usually get
like greasy roots but I do sometimes
just want to leave extra volume I want
some texture and you just can't beat the
teeth so I've got the natural and light
bear I've got clean and classic original
and then Eden I think Eden was my
favorite to be honest I can't be tell
too much of a difference a slight
difference in the thoughts a flavor
the scent of them but roast I love them
all so much big family at East another
part of cocoa butter this time the
firming one equally I have the same
things to say about this as I did the
last one
but this one of course also firms use a
really good father tell me on the size
on the boot a and yes they come of that
Charlotte Tilbury magic cream is also in
here but actually it's not quite
finished this one is in here because I
maybe I left a little for too long
accidentally but the texture I went to
use it the other day and it's no longer
creamy it's like putty
I could almost roll that into a ball
luckily I did get a lot of use out of it
before it went strange but if I just
then I don't know what this is like 90
quid on the moisturizer and it did that
after eight months I wouldn't have been
too happy I really did like this when it
was fresh but I would only really use it
on the days when I wanted to leave my
skin for a good hour or so after
applying moisturizer because I didn't
find my skin was ready for makeup for a
long long time after applying this
because it is a very rich luxurious
moisturizer but great for winter
gratefull is no makeup day is working
from home with a real treat for my skin
another skin treat were these little
capsules Estee Lauder advanced mark
Repair intense recovery capsules I just
love the whole process of capsular glue
calming these little tiny pods you'd
tear the top off put it in your hand it
was kind of like an oily silky
consistency Pat that onto your skin
before your final night cream or night
if you're a fan of the advanced night
repair range and this is a really nice
one to add into the collection not an
essential but more of a you know thing
to add in if you really like to pamper
yourself and as you were guest by the
name they are intense
so I've maybe used this once every two
or three nights just to really give my
skin irradiance left to the next day and
really enjoyed using them and although
they are expensive I probably would
repurchase them just because I really
enjoyed that particular part of my
evening routine speaking of which I have
a Estee Lauder advanced night repair the
original this is the synchronized
recovery complex this is kind of the
advanced night repair that everybody
knows and loves I use this every single
night whether it's this consistency or
the oil consistency which is indeed
what's the word IC balayage when it's
like faded a gradient god I love my mind
I'm using the oil formula at the moment
just cuz my skin's a bit dry from the
traveling I find that the oil is really
nourishing by still get a lot of benefit
from the original and yes will
definitely be repurchasing this it's
just kind of become one of those things
that I do without even thinking about it
but yeah I use this every single night
and actually have already repurchase
this another micellar water this is the
Neutrogena hydro boost I get through a
lot of mice
Auto so use it every day and every
morning and every night this one is
particularly hydrating as well this
entire range I really really like this
range very hydrating they got face wipes
they've got moisturizer toner and big
fan of the range remove my makeup really
well it's even got a little bit of
hyaluronic acid in there so great for a
little tiny bit of exfoliating the skin
but without the use of scrub and overall
just did a really good job so also quite
affordable and I will be refreshing this
we've got a couple of smaller products
I'm sure I have used up more makeup
maybe I forgot to keep hold of them but
in here I've got a Mac eyebrow pencil
this one is in the shade haven't got a
clue because absolutely all of the
writing has come off this one that's how
much I used it but it looks like the
lightest blonde color you can see it's a
really light color I really like the
fact that this is a rollup
so you never have to sharpen it it
always seems to be the exact right kind
of sickness for drawing on my brow hairs
making them look really natural so I
will be picking up the new one of these
and then I have you may have heard me
talking about these if you've heard my
yearly round up so my 2015 favorites and
my 2016 favorites both featured this and
it is the bite Beauty mattes creme lip
crown in the shade amaretto so this is
one of those products that I use as like
my go-to it's very much my signature lip
color really like the consistency of
this it is a matte product it's like a
rollup lipstick just love how it looks
on my lips even if my lips are dry this
will always look fabulous
I have already repurchase this every
time I go to the US I will buy one of
these from Sephora and yeah just love it
it's very much my the one that I keep on
going back to year after year to your
final products both of them are hair
related I've got the Cara Stars
k-lite Couture fixation medium hold
basically it's a hairspray really love
Carrie Styles as a brand I've definitely
gone through many many many bottoms
their shampoos and conditioners so
obviously didn't put them all in my
little rubbish bag this is a great
hairspray it's also really easy to brush
out so if you don't want to have crispy
hair that's a really nice one and then
the final thing is the shoe Tamara
straightforward time-saving blow dry oil
this was fantastic that I was free this
kind of all through the ends of my hair
and it makes it a lot easier to brush
through and also just also protect your
hair from the blow dryers you don't get
any heat damage one thing this has
reminded me of that I don't know why is
not in this bag because I've definitely
emptied at least five since I started
this bag I will insert a coat of it here
is the pure ology perfect for platinum
seven in one hairspray that is something
that I absolutely swear by it's one of
my all-time favorite products ever
basically if you struggle with knotty
hair or just basically anything it has
so many benefits to it I think I did a
blog post on it a little while ago if I
can find our leave a link down below
protect your hair from breakage from
split ends it nourishes the hair it
protects it from heat damage it
untangled your hair it just has so many
things that's grateful for me as soon as
I get out the shower
I really just cover my hair in this
spray it makes it so much easier to
brush through and I find that it really
helps the condition of my hair as well
whenever I go to the hairdresser they
look at my hair they see the bleach and
they almost prepare themselves to see
really damage like gnarly split ends but
then they always say well you have a
really good condition and I think that
it's because of that spray and then I
also couldn't oil in the ends that
really helps to keep it in good
condition so surprised that I don't have
any in this bag I must have forgotten
every time I finished one but I have
gone through a lot of those and I will
forever repurchase them so I stick that
in there as well so yeah that's
everything in my bag I've also gone
three loads of little combs and polishes
not sure why they're not in there and
tons of face masks
I mean I've obviously been quite
selective as to what I've decided keeps
to share with you but I tell you what
I'm so glad that I can now finally throw
aways for it this bag is been sitting
next to my bin for so long so I'm
excited to finally check them out okay
so now I can finally check that bag away
time to go downstairs for some Thai
green chicken curry
okay I so I just division you in the
bathroom cabinet while I take my makeup
off and so two extra mags had lots of
night kisses on the sofa and Charlie and
I have been looking at new puppies on
the internet so hopefully might not be
too long until we are tired as a family
and last night I just show you my
current evening routine so on days like
today I'm actually run out of cotton
pads which is really annoying I'm going
to use my oscar-winning from closing gel
I'm kind of switching between this and
the Niassa
which is actually a natural product and
really liked that one but I put it in a
separate bag and ready to talk about in
the video using this once at night okay
I would usually use - of skin tonic now
but aloe don't hurry compounds onion use
beads which usually are reserved for
flying because they're in little handy
pouches this is covert and V term
control facial discs and there might be
little dents which have exfoliating and
kind of hyaluronic acid built into them
and they do get a breeze from
exfoliation I probably would not use
these more than two twice or three times
a week but I'm I'm getting a bit
congested hormonal rooms on my chin it's
really good to just swim away any excess
skin cells and dead skin cells in
bacteria we do a really good job quite
affiliating advanced
a little bit of missile super skin eye
cream I put about a third of a pump
packed on my finger and then actually
the ring finger is best because it's the
most delicate I just Pat it on like a
c-shape and then really delicately rub
that into the eye area you're not
getting too close to the eye if you go
to perfect to get a bit congested but by
going here your eye area just kind of
take as much of the product as it wants
to it up building up too much okay and
in last product before bed I mentioned
this I think in my first everyday May
and this is the Charlotte Tilbury
overnight front and globe and loved the
color that I woke up that first morning
so as another favorite moment to feel as
many more like contrasting with my new
hair color and apply this again tonight
really impressed so far so hopefully
I'll have a nice glow in the morning I'm
hoping it will make the edges of my hair
go orange feel like my hair is very
absorbent of color right now think of
course okay so now that those ended in
ready for bed
I think we're going to carry on watching
much hello or much hello we just watched
the first episode downstairs and it's
really good so hopefully I'll be on stay
awake for another episode so Emma look

I'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
