daily vlog today it's going to be quite
Sunday I've got a photoshoot with Roger
and gallais and it's going to be really
beautiful and fun if any of the other
events have anything to go by it's move
very floral and it should be a really
fun date I thought I'd bring you guys
along show you a little bit of behind
the scenes what really goes on on a
blogger photoshoot and also just how I
prepare and what I take with me that
kind of thing
so yeah that's why I'm starting it at
home I have got a lil way suitcase with
me patched to the brim with outfit
changes with shoes accessories makeup
tops because I've been given a brief a
very thorough brief but you can never be
too prepared
so yeah before we get going I'm going to
show you what I'm bringing with me
so this down here on the floor is the
suitcase that I'm taking with me I've
got a couple of addresses in there
garment bags hanging ready to go
April's coming over in a second to help
me carry it all morning charlie and also
we're taking Dexter and Dickens on the
shoot with us today because my theme for
my particular fragrance what is that
Oh a shadow I saw something on the
screen and the theme for my fragrance is
relaxing so dogs obviously help me relax
and it could be quite nice to get the
boys in some of the photos so they're
coming with us
I digress yeah let me show you what is
in my little bag first of all one of our
challenges today is to create a flat lay
so I've got a few products which I think
will work really nicely in flat lay
first of all this beautiful little bag
you've probably seen this in a few of my
lookbook videos but because it's small
but also my color with a little bit of
gold on there it's just absolutely
perfect for flat layers I've also got in
here my Olympus PEN camera I've got the
white one now I used to have a brown one
we're broke because presenter doctor
Olympus and I've got to be white one to
keep me going and also very photogenic
so that's coming in the bed I've got
this little box here so the jewelry and
the flip camera around to show you
jewelry Brett's number names
okay so in here also for flat lay but
also for my outfit got a couple of
different bracelets
you may remember from my McArthur plan
shopping trip it's from Foley Foley it's
so beautiful and then some rose gold
ones from Ted Baker got my little Olivia
Burton watch and then some of my rings
is mostly Monica vinegar and again
jewelry just looks really lovely in flat
legs I've got all of those I've asked
the girls at the shoot if they can
assign me some flowers because I always
like to have flowers in my imagery I've
got some body lotion that's a spare
camera lens I've got some of my makeup I
think doesn't make up artists at the
shoot but I always like to bring some of
my own anyway for top-ups this I may
even use in the Flatley as well because
obviously it's very beautiful but also
if I just need a little bit of bronzer
and then these lipsticks are just really
really beautiful so I thought I can
either wear them or again use them in
the flat lace so very prepared got my
big camera with me then this side is a
little bit of a jumble but I've got a
few pairs of shoes my beautiful Nicholas
Kirkwood's with the gorgeous pearl heel
got some dresses under there that I've
ordered from a source like Alan Tino's
my son Peter Rossi all very much my
colour theme and then I've also packed
this because I thought it might require
knives for the flat lay to put one of
the beautiful dresses that in there on
that this rose gold hanger just have a
little bit of fashion in my flat lay so
those are the bits that I'm taking with
me I've put some curls through my hair
I'm going to take my straightness with
me as well we've got a really really
plain outfit on right now because as I
said we're taking the dogs and so don't
want to put on one of my lovely dresses
making it covered in dog hair which
reminds me I'm going to take a lint
roller and I'm also going to take these
two habits I've got a little mini
hairspray and mini dry shampoo mainly
because my roots more than anything I
find that dry shampoo just really makes
my roots look a lot lighter between
coloring sessions so I'm going to finish
packing up my little suitcase and I will
see you at the show
okay so we just arrived at you know
Internet and first of all suitcase is
beautiful I feel like I just want to
hide the balance you content here all
day in so sewing you'll see around there
ii and ii see there is another pocket
dog here one of the girls has got a
little barbara who has gone that long
hands of his dog so there are now three
for helping out the makeup is I put on
my first dress today which is beautiful
floral embroidered needle threader oh so
pretty
April is busy filming away because we
just cannot ever have any trouble
accepting it and keep us company if you
help you along so now I'm going to get
my headshots on while making sure
looking fresh will very pink much
all right my little man let me tell her
why
basically the full-length mirror around
the cab he keeps seeing himself in it
doesn't know your son will be conquered
next on the other hand has made himself
a wife at home on this fluffy rug
haven't you my monkey oh it is - our
brain pushes let me call the house
housing for nothing as part of the
frustrated take no little have your bow
getting very sever during evolution sexy
oh she's so gorgeous
okay so we just had a lovely lunch and
April and I've been doing even more
photos in the little backdrop over there
no I promise to very bright so here
we've got power back floor doing
something so the bits and bobs I showed
you earlier we're going to implant
leaves that represent all different
feelings that we get from our
preferences so you can see art Dexter
please no detectives about the room some
institutions that very you can see here
this is what a very Pro slightly
surfaces like so this is the flat place
for the Cassie frenzy I'm hoping I'm
saying that right but this is that maybe
you saw got some roses some beautiful
jewelry some shells men some flowers
over here this one's a little bit more
tropical this is the setup look at that
how here's the world alright so now that
we've had lunch from a general flatmate
next it is individual shops time and in
this beautiful area was kraid a little
feathery bit of a dressing room we've
got some a future essence on mannequins
and on hangers
I just want to recreate this in my house
I can show you
so that you don't want me but maybe I
should hold it is already time to do the
final shot I gonna do a group shot
happy definite improvement in this
beautiful dressing area yes final sham
let's do this brains condition
suggesting
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
uncle's always talk in the same room
temptation
home again after a successful day's
shoot that was probably the most fun and
also chilled out shoot I think I've ever
done
definitely helped with these venue was
amazing it was just so well organized
and of course the fragrance I absolutely
adore as well I've even been thinking I
might try and grab a group of vloggers
and see if they want to like split the
costs using that studio with me because
it's just a perfect place to film loads
and loads of content so if you're a
blogger and you're watching and you like
to look at that space and let me know if
I definitely want to rent it out
especially when it gets kind of wintery
and you don't want to be doing outdoor
street style stuff definitely some food
for thought and yeah I'm home now can
you go and pick up a blogger mail have
some dinner and I think I'm going to
wrap this log up here but you guys have
seen all of that so many times you fall
but I hope you enjoy seeing behind the
scenes of a bloggers photo shoot and I'm
so excited to see the final images I
will leave links to where they'll
publish down below and that's probably
going to all over my blog and Instagram
Instagram stories so definitely check
those out and yeah thank you Roger and

fabulous fabulous day so I will see you
