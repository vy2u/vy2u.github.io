haven't done a weekly vlog in a few
weeks
and I kind of enjoyed vlogging while us
in Hong Kong so I thought I would kick
up the old weekly vlog and do one this
week for you it's Monday today 10:00 to
12:00 in case you're wondering I've had
already quite a busy morning my
boyfriend's sister Scarlett is staying
with us this week because she's
interning at Tom Ford with my friend
Vicky who works there in the beauty
department so I got up super early to
take her into the offices and then I did
a few errands in town and then I met up
with the guys from home who sometimes
take my blog photos for me and we did a
really quick oh my gosh I'm falling over
we did a really quick photo session in
Bank so quite productive morning's so
far I've just got home and I really need
to write myself a to-do list because I'm
having one of those days when I have so
many things to do and it all just keeps
circling in my head unless I write stuff
down so that's what I'm gonna do right
now this week I have quite a mixture of
things going on I have a few days at
home I have one really really super busy
day in town where hopefully you can come
with me to some meetings and some blog
events which should be good fun and then
this weekend as Easter weekend - I'm
probably gonna finish logging on Friday
but yeah Thursday we are going to start
decorating in the kitchen so I will vlog
that as well so yeah that's the plan of
the week
feeling a lot more chilled enough I've
written my to-do-list I have written my
bullet points of what I have to get done
today on my little kekeke a notebook
this one's really cute it's also got
down here little icons for how many
glasses of water you should drink a day
which is really handy cuz I definitely
do not drink enough water and then in my
diary which is from an American company
called divine love Co I've just written
down the post I need to get up this week
I still am really bad at getting into a
blog post schedule but I've got a few
brand collaborations going up this week
so I'm on a strict deadline which means
I have a few posts which have to go out
this week so now I'm just gonna have a
bowl of Cheerios because I cannot film
when I'm hungry otherwise I'm so grumpy
and have a sugar low as you might have
seen in my no it's not yeah I wouldn't
say maybe I build a video the other day
and I was on such a show below the whole
time I was just completely spaced out so
now some Cheerios and then start filming
by the way how cute is this little ring
holder I got the other day it's like a
sausage dog you went to put the rings on
its tail but I think I'm just going to
use it as little ornament I thought that
was quite cute
okay first video is done I am mentally
exhausted and my bedroom is now an
absolute bomb site as it always is when
I film log of men unboxing videos I say
when I film I've only ever done two
before but yeah it's a bomb site so I
got some really lovely things actually
but you won't have seen the video yet so
I'm not gonna show you what they were
but really really exciting bits and bobs
and and I've just got a load more emails
from dawdle saying I have more stuff to
pick up so I'm gonna head down there in
a second as well and yeah so I'm gonna
start tidying and I have just got
changed slightly changed my makeup and
my hair okay I've just brushed it and
I've put on a different top because
trick of the youtubers I'm just gonna
film two videos in a row next video I'm
gonna film is my Hong Kong beauty haul I
can't believe I've laughed at this long
someone actually messaged me behind why
Hong Kong beauty haul so I'm gonna film
that right now I was gonna do a beauty
haul just purely Beauty but I also
picked up some really nice home pieces
so I'm gonna make it just a general Hong
Kong haul and so yeah I'm gonna get
cracking with that and I will see you in
about 25 minutes okay that video was a
little bit easier to film less of a bomb
sites clear up but two things firstly
I've just realised I filmed the whole
video with this stupid tag hanging from
my top it's one of these like returns
will not be accepted and this top was a
sample from the PR company so I didn't
think you would have any tags on it so I
didn't check but um yeah it's bright
pink so that it's gonna be really
embarrassing and you're definitely gonna
be I'll see it in the videos so often so
that reminds me when I was in Hong Kong
um Rory and I was shown around the
peninsula hotel by the PR manager and I
was feeling really swanky I saw my
Valentino's are doing a really nice like
white trash from French Connection which
you might have seen on my Instagram but
then when I was editing the photo to put
on my Instagram
i zoomed in so like check all the
details and I realized that my dress had
been undone the entire time and you
could see my underwear like you know how
the dress is a zip up down the side and
they have like a long as it well my zip
was completely undone and you can see my
knickers oh my god and I've been
prancing
there's like five-star hotel looking
like an absolute hit in fact if you call
my Instagram and you look at that photo
the one where I've got like a telescope
and I'm looking out onto Hongkong Bay
you can see that my dress is wide open
because I was like I like the photo so
much and maybe no notice and I was so
waiting for people to comment being like
only a dress isn't done but nobody did
so now you can go and have a look and
how little laughs to yourself yeah the
reason why I'm out of breath by the way
is because Dexter as soon as I finished
filming he charged under the bed and
grabbed a chocolate coin and obviously
chocolate is poisonous to dogs so then I
was chasing him around the house like a
madwoman trying to get out that that out
of his mouth so gonna do another tidy up
session in here um and then I'm gonna go
down to dawdle and pick up some post
okay back from dawdle I'm gonna go and
have some lunch in a minute but first I
thought I'd show you a couple of the
bits and bobs which I got sent one of
which is really cool and a really fun
ideas and it's kind of like a quiz or a
test so I thought we could do that
together which might be good fun um
gosh I'm still her breath I'm always out
of breath and I'm vlogging but I'm going
to unpackage a few bits and bobs and
show you the best of today's vlog a mail
okay so here is the selection of pieces
which I've been sent today first of all
this ginormous box of goodies from
Claire's accessories absolutely rammed
full of jewelry I haven't even had a
little look at these yet but it's lots
of bits and bobs from their summer
collection you've got some rings some
bracelets and there's a matching
necklace wow this is crazy a huge kind
of embellished necklace there or
bracelet
lots of earrings this looks like a
hairpiece I've also been sent a
selection of jewelry from a brand called
jewelry box including these gorgeous
like infinity bracelets necklaces sorry
so there rose gold and they've got that
beautiful delicate infinity sign on them
God my hand looks really old old ladyish
and then we've got this beautiful very
delicate pearl bracelet with a little
silver cross on it and something quite
similar in white pearl with the silver
peace sign which I think all it really
nice layered together it might pop those
on in a second it was also sent three
mini fragrances by Chloe these are just
the most gorgeous little handbag sized
ones I think they actually did the same
send out last you and I still have a few
of them floating around in my travel
bags and I also didn't a source order
but I didn't really like anything in it
there was these shoes which I don't know
I just don't think I'll wear them very
much and then I also got these Trainer
kind of shoes that's have a look
they're like pink satin with a rose gold
toe but again I think I'm just a little
bit too cool for me and I probably won't
wear them so that's that oh today as I
think I mentioned earlier is a national
fragrance day and celebrate up and sent
a little bundle of pieces from dove as
in dove deodorant of body care because
they have partnered let me just check
how metal is right from the press
release they've partnered with Gia
fouled an hopefully I pronounced that
right sounds fancy in French which is a
fragrance house I believe in Paris this
is global fragrance house to reveal the
powerful psychological associations our
scent
now this is something that I've always
been so
I don't know adamant about really not
the right word but I find fragrance and
the memories it evokes so strong like
for me whenever I smell piss plain Sun
lotion I'm always like oh it reminds me
of holidays and I was younger because
it's what mom always used to put on me
and certain fragrances just remind me of
my mom when I was little and they've
also put on this information pack that
there are life stages of scent
and I think this is so interesting and
it says like from the fragrance of our
perp from the perfume of our wedding day
to the smell of our children shampoo the
power of fragrance really is strong
evoking memories I read that really
wrong but yeah it's saying how in
childhood we experience scents and they
provide a fundamental anchor to mother
so explains our thing about pissed when
reflected in the powdery scent notes
used in dove soft feel antiperspirant
which evokes cleanliness comfort
feminism right for me if ever I smelled
talcum powder I'm like oh reminds me
when I was a baby the reason why they've
sent me this pack is to promote the
sense of their Dove soft feels which has
a powdery fragrance developed by as
you've all done I'm hoping that that is
a right way to pronounce it and
obviously it's a really gorgeous product
I'm a huge fan of Dove and yeah I can
vouch for this for the fact that they're
lovely and moisturizing and just
generally smell amazing all the time and
they've sent me a scent psychology kit
so while blindfolded I've got to smell
the notes that make up dove soft feel
and report back on the findings so as
soon as Charlie finishes in the shower
I'm gonna get him to blindfold me and
these little cents here with a pink
labels on them and I've got to guess
what they are I'm so bad at guessing
fragrances so yeah let's see how it goes
okay so I've just put on my
dressing-gown cuz I'm a little bit
chilly got my silk I mask and Charlie's
gonna help me do the center sorry
darling excited he's excited so we've
got these little bottles which have got
centum and true
that's graceful no sense in them pay
attention you got yeah I know exactly
oh yeah don't say anything laughs you're
on it so these are all got perfumes in
them which are ingredients in this yeah
you just wish there you got to peel the
sticker off look at the thing so maybe
it's gonna be vanilla but don't say it
you should show you the camera and make
sure it focuses yeah and then put it on
one of these and then let me sniff it
I'm entrusting you darling
yeah okay ready I don't know if the
camera can read them okay hold it still
I've just got a knack on my hand it's
really hard looking not being on see
where the cameras can you tell me if I'm
pointy yeah I sundae nice give it a
sniff um it smells like something that I
would eat I don't know anything else
banana it spit its almondy is it banana
come on you can save I guess it next one
please darling
whatever it is it in dolphin it's the
dog you know they have an essential oil
I mean right outside it reminds me what
like swimming pool toilet okay I'm
having to switch angles because my arms
are aching right this is the third one
all right this way okay Charlie likes
this one let's see what it is
when we give it a lot for the lift right
right any guy did it by my name is yes
by a nice now probably on it too close
cuz in it and I feel like it's a really
strong version of something really try
give you claim you make them you wear
them on the beach
flip tops you're on the right line
sandals Underwood yeah it's a good one
that blue I'm not gonna put the head
thing on because and I can't see the
camera and I can't read the bottle
anyway yeah so Charlie's is pouring the
last one oh this reminds me of dog smell
yeah I didn't actually know what that
means mellows short of it no let me
guess Jimmy okay um it's definitely
floor all right yeah I mean you're not
gonna guess this though it's definitely
that powdery smell yeah the opposite of
hard soft and then another word for
touch soft feel
yeah that's the smell hmm so maybe this
is just a wrong the dog smell so
yes maybe it's the one that they did is
this the perfume bottle yeah I haven't
but it's the same oh I see yeah that's
actually really quite nice how funny we
instantly recognize out the days where
it will last last night that's the
clever thing with sex isn't it so with a
little bit of help from Charlie a few
good tips and we did pretty well there
don't we don't think yeah yeah I won't
if I didn't learn in advance so I just
uh kudex the one in there oh I feel like
I need to go to bed with my dressing
gown and my hang on so yes pass the test
and those are the ingredients in doves
soft feel
motley avocado
good morning it is Tuesday my camera
battery died last night so I didn't
really finish vlogging just went to
mom's house and then went to one of her
friends houses which was really nice try
you just cooked a lovely breakfast I've
just been eating at that productive
morning so far I've edited two videos
talking to you
and I have edited my Hong Kong blog post
which has just gone live yeah so that's
what I've been up to so far this morning
we've got someone coming over in a
minute to quotas for some astroturf for
our lawn and and surprisingly it looks
really realistic let me show you so
these are the samples of the astroturf
copper you told your friends between
them but I think this is one we're going
to go for because it's slightly more
natural of things it's got LNO it's got
more yellowy bits in it so it looks
quite real but yeah when you put it on
the lawn looks very realistic nylons a
little bit more muddy so we thought we'd
get some quotes for that Dexter has been
helping mummy decide haven't you so the
guys just got here for our lawn and look
at his car oh my god it's actually
golden girl this is brilliant
which do you prefer this - oh this one
is well it's more it's more springy than
this one quite a bit thicker
oh yeah it's quite a nice blast the
fixture next week oh gosh I think this
expensive fixture I think you've got the
deciding vote which do you like that
which do you make oh my god he's posing
you are so handsome Rooney Rooney just
got back from a quick dog walk with
Dexter and I picked up I love the bunch
of flowers from Waitrose because I'm
doing a blog post in collaboration with
dove and I tend to make all of my beauty
blog posts quite floral these days I
finally make the post of a little bit
prettier so yeah that's what I've been
doing for the past hour just taking some
photos for that and I'm very happy with
them so that'll be on the blog probably
before you've seen this blog post
actually so now I'm gonna edit I've got
to edit a blog post from Costa Rica or
piss plane 1 and gonna edit the photos
from dove Charlie's telling funny faces
out the window
Charlie's watering the garden Dexter's
helping and I'm just gonna finish at the
end cuz of blog posts you fully head out
this evening so I've been a very bad
vlogger this afternoon I haven't really
blogged that much of I pretty much has
been busy doing work stuff but Charlie
and I are heading out now so this is
locking up and we're going to a place
called Theo's Italian I think it's
called which I believe is in a hotel so
I'll show you the hotel later on which
one it is but
else court and I think the chef is
showing us how to make some nice Italian
dishes so it should be a good fun
evening we're both pretty hungry so yes
let's go
I've been a very bad vlogger today after
the exercise class oh my god look at my
hair
so flat I showered after a gym session
at the core collective and didn't
straighten or curled my hair even though
there were oh my god what have I done
even though there were GHD is better I
just don't really have time stir
anything with my hair and now it's
raining
so yeah today has pretty much just been
oh my god back-to-back meetings none of
which I really could blog mostly because
I had my hands full of bags I just can't
stop looking at my hair let's just
pretend that it's not happening and yes
it started to rain and I had my hands
full of bags everybody was very generous
and gave me lots of bits and bobs to try
out so I just didn't have a free hand
for vlogging but basically I've just
been at meetings all day it's six
o'clock now and Charlie and I are about
to start clearing out our kitchen and
scrubbing down the cupboards because
we're going to start painting our
kitchen tomorrow morning so in a repair
door tonight one of the meetings I had
was with the agency that looks after
Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and I finally got my
award which is this very snazzy looking
item here and so I won the award I
actually found out that I won it was in
Costa Rica and it is the 2016 Johnson &amp;amp;
Johnson award for best emerging blogger
it says best emerging blogger on here
but I thought it was best emerging
beauty blogger maybe it's best emerging
vulgar in general which is pretty
exciting quite a big deal actually to
get a Johnson Johnson award so really
excited to finally have this beautiful
thing gotta find somewhere to put it
probably in good central viewing
position on the mantelpiece or something
I'm very proud of my little my little
blog and my nice award so yeah that's
what I've been up to this afternoon and
also have a meeting with Debenhams had a
top secret meeting and I hate being the
one that says that but yeah and that
kind of means there's lots of exciting
things coming up in summer so yeah I'm
just gonna get changing out into
something a little bit more scruff so
what we're doing in the kitchen
is we're basically read
using our covers I think I've looked a
while ago saying that I was going to do
it but this weekend because it's a
four-day weekend we finally got around
to doing it and although we haven't got
the pain yet we're going to go to home
base tomorrow and pick up some paint
basically we're just gonna do them white
again but there's loads of little bashes
on them that we haven't really done
anything to the kitchen since we got it
like this all this you know nicks and
signs of wear so we thought we'd refresh
that and then up here it's currently
light blue and I think we're going to
use like a pharaoh and ball kind of
missile seiji kind of green color to
make it a little bit more modern a
little bit more to our tastes so yeah
nothing major but we thought just that
little fresh lick of paint would make
quite a nice difference to the kitchen
just mean myself a nice cup of tea and
now we're just gonna clear all of the
stuff like this kind of stuff we're just
going to move upstairs so they don't get
paint on everything
good morning it is 20 Friday today the
first there's bank holiday weekend
though being super stereotypical we went
to the home base cursing this morning
and we picked up load paint which is all
ready for us to start painting the
kitchen yes they did all the preparation
as you saw I think I've looked it we
just did some things down and use some
sugar so terrible the breeze put the
handles off and cleared it all away so
we picked up a few bits from home base
got some kitchen paint in off-white
color just slightly off-white for the
cupboards we've got a white base coat or
so for the cupboards we're gonna get a
pheromone ball color for up here but
they didn't have it in stock so we're
gonna get that another day um and then
we've got some pure white for the walls
some painting stuff some masking tape
that'll home base hall for you Charlie
got some varnish for the table outside
and some paint brushes meanwhile charlie
is preparing our lunch what are you
cooking down jr. vegetables ooh nice
Alex you found the recipe this looks
good
so are Thermomix came with a Thermomix
cookbook and charlie is gonna cook us
this chicken or vegetable soup bomb them
and I start the baking baking
now a couple of hours I picked up the
vlogging camera we've been painting
probably for like it's three or four
hours and we've only just finished the
primer coat so taking a lot longer than
I anticipated
so then after primer we've got to let
that dry for six hours and in the
meantime we're gonna paint the walls and
then I think we're gonna do the second
coat tomorrow but yeah a lot longer than
I thought maybe we should just got
someone over Easter but I need for
saving some money by doing it ourselves
it's looking really good
so I will give you a little update I'll
take you out and showing you what it
looks like but I think kind of doesn't
look that different because the primer
is the same color as the cupboard so
yeah let's have a look downstairs
Charlie made us a really lovely
vegetable soup in the Thermomix
earlier which we ate outside and it's
such gorgeous weather today so we're
just having nice soup in the Sun but
yeah let me show you how it's looking in
the kitchen
dogs are waiting patiently outside the
kitchen
music and on me so I think we're going
to finish painting for today we finished
doing the primer as I said earlier we
were going to do the walls but it's 20
to 5 to try and I are going out for
dinner later so I think we're just gonna
stop we're just hanging it will look at
it ain't that we're going to paint the
cupboards in tomorrow's a little sneaky
not been too adventurous we've just gone
full milk-white which is just slightly
off-white it should look quite nice and
it's green why is it green
I hope it's not green there are some
soup oh my god
it's green and speckled a whisk it up so
that is done for today I think I'm going
to edit this vlog now so I'm going to
finish it here and I will see you guys
in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
