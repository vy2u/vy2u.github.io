a really sad day today I'm going to
share with you my 2016 huge annual
beauty favorites and I know I'm a little
bit late to the party I'm sure you've
had that before and but I aren't you in
a recent video it was my everyday makeup
routine if it's something you still
wanted to see and the overwhelming
response was yes so I have put together
my favorite products throughout the
whole of last year I actually spent a
few hours this morning watching through
my favorite videos from last year all of
which if you're interested I'll leave
linked down below if anything is kind of
thing to see how much I've changed gosh
I look a lot older as I go to this time
last year but also to really refresh my
memory as to the perks that I loved way
back in January 2016 because I didn't
want it to be the products that were
fresh in my mind the ones that I just
loved towards the end of last year so
I've managed to put together my
favourite products throughout the whole
last year and this video is going to
cover beauty including skincare makeup
and hair care and then on Wednesday I'm
going to also share with you my fashion
favorites from last year so that's going
to be pretty much my most worn items and
the things I really loved wearing
throughout 2016 so if you're not already
then please make sure you are subscribed
so that you don't miss that as with all
of my videos everything that I mentioned
in this video as well as when wearing
etc will be linked down below
especially the beauty products they will
still be available online I think all of
these so if you didn't want to shop any
of them then there'll be a direct link
down in the description box so first of
all this morning I rewatched my 2015
Beauty favourite and I have to say most
of those I actually did my top 10
products for 2015 most of those are
still favorites of mine first of all
with the Liz Earle cleanse and polish so
I mentioned that last year and this year
is pretty much being the same this time
round I've been really loving
this is a limited-edition sweet orange
enclose but basically any comes in
Polish I'm huge fan of I try a lot of
cleansers but this one I find my skin
just loves it it's really good at
keeping my skin feeling very balanced
does a great job of removing my makeup
and never leaves my skin angry and I
just really love the process of the
Lazar cleanse and polish so as it was in
last year's favorites
once again my first favor of 2016 is
labelled cleanse and polish last year I
also mentioned a dolphin oil I think it
was revitalizing although I mentioned
last year this year another dolphin oil
but I have become throughout the second
half of this year totally obsessed with
the lumia essential i can never remember
the name without reading off the bottom
you'll have seen this in countless
videos especially recent everyday makeup
routines and get ready with me that type
of thing because I pretty much use this
every single day
I've got about halfway through if I
start been using it for about three
months and you guys know the dolphin is
a really luxurious brand and the fact
that I've got so much in use out of this
you can use one pump I feel like it is a
really good investment for your skincare
especially during these colder months
when skin's doing a little bit dry needs
a bit more nourishment because it does
have that foil in the formula it really
is a really luxurious and sumptuous
trick for the skin dolphin really has
been a favorite brand all around this
year and also you will have seen me
talking about this a lot I couldn't not
preach this in my daily favorites
because it has been my favorite
moisturizer of the whole year despite
the fact I've only had it about four
months it readers
blow the ends out the water itself am
lumia essential oil gel cream my skin
upsetting loves oil gel creams it loves
the nourishment from the oil get love
the consistency of a gel cream you still
get the moisturizing cream immature
isness of the cream but also because
it's a gel it's just a little bit more
lightweight so fabulous if you have
combination skin so the two together
really have been my go-to skincare for
the second half of this year throughout
the summer months before I discovered
those two you will have heard me talking
about these two this is the dr. Savur
supreme day cream and what I really like
about this one is that it's good for
protecting the skin not from UVA and UVB
damage but actually I think it's called
new light which essentially is the light
emitted from electronic screens but that
for phones our laptop things like that
and that can be just as aging as UVA and
UVB but weirdly it's not spoken about
quite so much in the beauty industry so
I spend a lot of time my laptop so for
me having that protection on my skin was
really great consistency wise I compare
this to the Charlotte so we magic cream
if you've tried that which I also love
my skin that loves it just as much but
because it does have that extra benefit
that's why I really love this I also
paired that with my sir Chapman skin
eases skin insurance SPF 30 so because
of that SPF I gave my skin the
protection from from the UVA UVB but
also it has a really great city to
Lutins excelling powers so doesn't all
around really good protective for the
skin so that was my go-to combination
for the first half of the year and still
a real favorite combination to be honest
I just switched things up for the dark
pants for the second half of year so
then moving on to foundation the Rimmel
match perfection is one that I also
featured in my 2015 beauty favorites and
it's still a favorite this year to be
honest I used a lot towards the
beginning of the year then it ran out
and I didn't repurchase it and I've
actually only repurchase this a few
weeks ago and it really did remind me oh
my gosh this is probably my favorite
foundation of all time and it's amazing
that it's a drugstore one - this is the
one where when I wear it I get the most
compliments on my skin I find it the
best coverage for filming if I'm doing a
photo shoot I wear on those days I
wouldn't say it's heavy coverage because
personally I prefer I like more natural
makeup look but it really is a good
coverage even if I have a bit of
discoloration this will still do the
trick and give me a complexion that I'm
happy with another foundation favorite
and one that I particularly loved at the
beginning of this year I think I first
started really using this when I went to
Costa Rica so that was last January this
time last year also I rewatched my Costa
Rica and video a couple of days ago and
it really still is one of my favorite
videos of all time case you didn't know
in 2016 I was a big win Sun ambassador
to the UK ambassador for peace waiting
Sun motions and we went to Costa Rica
and we had such an amazing time and I
feel like I
many subscribers back then so not many
people saw myself through the video so
even you want to see it pretty cool yeah
we got up throughout that and I'll leave
that link down below because a really
great video and I don't think it's had
many of you so give that a watch if you
want soup but while I was there I used
the gallon
jolly paint terracotta beautifying
foundation for some gift healthy glow
SPF 20 not the official name I think it
is called visually change but not only
do I love the actual formula but I also
love the packaging the fact that is in
this query tube which as you can see
sadly I'm coming to the end of then
effect that it's in this tube as opposed
to a glass container makes it so good
for traveling so this is the one this
one actually has come from my gym bag I
also keep one in my everyday makeup and
my makeup bag and when I travel this is
one that I grow as well because it's so
light especially if I'm nearly done with
it it means that it just doesn't take up
any room or any weight at all
consistency wise once again when I'm
traveling because of long flights and
air conditioning things like that
my skin can be a little bit upset but
this one just works
nema how my skin is feeling even if I'm
using a different moisturiser to my
usual one if I've got some something on
my face this just works
I've gives me a really lovely fresh
cheery confection you also won't be
surprised to hear that within my
favorite foundations and these are the
only free that we just seem to rotate
throughout is the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation this one I was
very slow to the party with I think I
only started trying this in springtime
this year but it does what it says on
the tin it gives you such a beautiful
luminous complexion so healthy so fresh
looking and then suits the lightest
coverage of the three so if I'm perhaps
spending a day out with friends I want
to have a fabulous complexion I'm not
necessarily filming and will require
that much coverage this is one that'll
go for and it is pricey but actually I
do think it's worth it if you are
looking for a slightly more high-end
foundation and I perceive quite a few
emails from you guys asking for a
higher-end foundation that I truly
treated or I would say this one
down every single time my favorite
bronzer of 2016 is the exact same of my
favorite bronzer from 2015 and it is the
hourglass the official name is the
luminous bronze light now I have to say
I did also love a lot of gallon bronzers
this year I loved their Four Seasons
terracotta one I can't remember the
names of them but if you go back through
my monthly favourites you'll see quite a
few Gillan runs of features but somehow
I just keep going back to this one I
bought it in a Sephora in New York back
in February like two years ago so it's
about time I got myself a new one
wanting next go to the US I'll pick up
another one I really like the packaging
of this wreath simple sleek metallic
gold packaging inside you've got the
mirror and then also the bronzer itself
is this almost marbled powder I think
perhaps the thing that makes us
different from other bronzers is that
luminosity unitive brings to the skin
while I do have slightly oily
combination skin and I need it too
magnified I just can't resist that glow
and this truly does give me that while
giving it the perfect color for my
complexion and I feel like it just gives
me a really warm healthy glow I'm
wearing it right now I'm wearing a lot
of these products as you have probably
already spotted from a few of my clips
you've seen me putting on its what I'm
wearing today and yeah I just keep going
back to this over and over again so it
could not include this in my 2016 beauty
favorites I'm going to move on to eyes
next and this one I also featured in my
favorite last year can you tell by now
that I am a creature of habit and I know
what I love but actually I believe that
the brown one only came out this year so
I think I included the black one in my
2015 GT favorites but it's the benefit
roller lash mascara I love the brown
this year because as I said I'm all
about that natural makeup look and real
I find a lot softer especially if you're
blonde and fair like I am then Brown is
such a really lovely soft way of still
having that really beautiful defined eye
area roller lash I mean it's just if you
haven't tried this you really really
must because you don't need eyelash
curlers although I sometimes do still
use eyelash curlers
because it surely does roll the lashes
into a beautiful curl the brush itself
is beautiful it's bristled which means
it separates the lashes the formulas
long-lasting is flake it's not always
freeze in the slightest I look like an
absolute I don't know what when I come
out the shower after the gym because I
do like to wear mascara in the gym
because it really doesn't hurt and so
yeah not waterproof I would love to see
I'm bringing our waterproof version of
this so the formula the color it's just
that perfect Brown that's not too light
not too dark and I don't have a bad word
to say about this it's fairly affordable
- it really is probably probably my
favorite mascara of all time but having
said that I also this year totally fell
in love with the grand entrance mascara
from Elizabeth Arden not the show
entrance whatever I was calling it
before this one once again has that
slightly scooped and very stiff bristle
brush which keep which seems to be my
favorite I think because it really helps
to separate out the lashes and doesn't
build clumps but then equally if you
flip the brush upside down give it a bit
of a wiggle you can add that volume this
is a black mascara this is one that I
want to wear when I want a little bit
more definition
I do sometimes pair the two together
this one first this one second but to be
honest I really love the fluttery lashes
no clumps really long lashes and that's
exactly what these two give me for
eyeshadow throughout the entire year I
once again took it to Costa Rica with me
and then use it throughout the year I
wanted to tell you about the zoeva nude
spectrum eyeshadow palette but I
couldn't find it I don't know where it
is I'll try to insert the photo of it
here so that you know the one that I'm
talking about but basically it has all
the most beautiful colors
most of our metallic so it's great if
you want a little bit of shimmer on your
eyelid but or really beautiful wearable
neutrals which I got so much use out of
this year I'm hoping it's in one of my
travel makeup bags up in the loft
fingers crossed because it's probably
one of my all-time I shadow palette I
could have talked about so many i shadow
palettes this year but another one that
I needed to mention is the Stila eyes
are the window shadow palettes this one
is not only beautiful it's most gorgeous
packaging rose gold and golden and OH
huge mirror great
vacation and the most fabulous selection
of colors are like this believe that it
does have a few more matte shades which
is perfect for a really lovely soft
everyday look
and then also some shimmer shades all in
I'm calling a pinky Brown which for me I
adore for obvious reasons Browns neutral
paint my favorite color and then some
darker ones too which I like to use on
the crease I also use a smaller brush to
blend into my lower lash lines give a
little bit more definition it seems to
have me covered on all bases even a brow
highlight color in this really light one
a shimmering champagne color but that
pop in the middle I just absolutely love
it and they love to how many eyeshadows
palette I have tried this year this is
one that I keep going back to and no
surprises my favorite eyeliner of the
year is the Tom Ford eye defining pen
that's Tino
this one I use top one which is the
longer nib trying it a lot more easy to
draw in that defined line I don't really
go overboard my eyeliner in fact there
are a few months this year that I really
just didn't bother with eyeliner but
when I do wear it this is the one that
that I go back to time after time after
time I only have sorts of things to say
about this the black is the most intense
deep black the long-lasting color it's
easy to apply and it's just fabulous it
is expensive for an eyeliner but I've
probably been using this oh I don't know
maybe four times a week for nearly a
year
and it's still going strong so if you
like your investment pieces that you
really love value and price per wear or
price per use this is a really really
fabulous for and a great way to try out
some contour makeup if you're starting
to invest in luxury beauty a little bit
more - speaking of time forward I don't
feel like I actually spoke about this
this much on my channel this year I
think maybe in favourites video and
again read with me but it's a Tom Ford
fiber brow gel now maybe the reason I
didn't talk about this that much is
because there are some fantastic cheaper
alternatives
I love gimme brow I love the Rimmel brow
gel but of course this is my genuine
favorite products of 2016 and for brow
gels it's got C this one so not only is
the color perfect for me I find a little
application of perfect size you can
build volume
because the kind of set funds are not in
a safe way but it also has those little
fibers within it so if you are a little
bit lacking in the browser Department
like myself you want to build them up a
bit more and this one truly is fabulous
finally in the makeup category lip
products and to be honest I love so so
so many lip products this year I really
just got a lot of beautiful brownie
Pink's and that really did become like
my color I still am in love with the
bite Matt creme lip crowned that I
mentioned in last year's Beauty annual
favorites but for me the standout new
product that I keep reaching for this
year is the Shanta kai lipstick for
Roush I live in the shade Mirage yellow
CMAs recently my everyday makeup routine
you'll also seen it on my lips in 97
miles logs that creamy formula it's
almost like a bomb that's how
comfortable it is but also just most
beautiful color the perfect amount of
pigment 50 I really was all about
comfort on my lips I love the girl army
and come with cool biz part of their
robes oh my gosh mind blank I'll leave
it links down below
I love the Eagle arms army lipstick I
also always love the Clarins instant eye
lift on sectors but the color the
consistency just everything about this
makes this my number one lip products of
2016 before I move away from the face
entirely I need to give an honorary
shout-out to the Armani Beauty Armani
Prima refreshing makeup spray so this is
a fixing spray and I don't think I've
actually talked about this but I
probably use this every single day or at
least those days and I'm leaving the
house so I had to give this mentioned
for my annual favorites I'm often out of
the house all day of meetings and events
or a photo shoot so I really do rely on
my makeup staying in place and looking
at good looking fresh all day long so I
have an easiness and relying on this for
I say at least the last six months and a
few minutes or it's I haven't really
given it the shoutouts that it deserves
but here we are this is my favorite
makeup setting spray of 2016
okay now that make up and skin care
about the way I want to share with you a
few
our favorites now I tend to switch up my
shampoo and conditioner quite a lot my
hair doesn't really like consistency it
like sermon likes it when I switch
things up a little bit but there are a
few products that I have returned to
time and time again namely from pure
ology this one is absolutely empty I've
got every last drip out of this it's a
perfect for platinum shampoo this one is
blue not purple but still manages to
keep my hair in a really nice tone it's
not powerful at toning as a purple
shampoo and I just tend to switch around
from various purple shampoos but as a
regular shampoo and conditioners that
this range is absolutely fabulous for my
hair as is the matching leave-in
conditioner and also the color fanatic
one the perfect for platinum is great
obviously for platinum blonde and this
range is also great platinum blonde but
especially those that have had their
hair colored so this source is believe
in conditioner and I spritz my wet hair
with this it not only conditions and
sort my ends from getting dry but also
makes my hands and much easier to be
title and much quicker to blow-dry this
I could not live without this and I know
that's a pretty out-there statement but
I have come to rely on this and not only
do I have a few in this size but I also
have little mini versions which you'll
have seen on my trips probably if I've
done like a lot in my holiday makeup bag
you have seen those I just throw in the
back there are so many more benefits I
didn't even know about helps protects
against color fading helps even out
porosity weightless conditions helps
behalf feel nourished makes blow-drying
quicker feels a bit M you know what
there's no wonder why when I go to the
hairdresser and they say oh you're
having quite good condition considering
you color it so much it's probably
because of dis with all of those
incredible benefits longer back and help
you use hair breakage help strength from
the feel of the hair fiber helps against
heat protection so many benefits to this
and I will continue researching this
over and over again because it's just
amazing also in the hair category before
I forget I want to give a shout out to
the Dyson supersonic hair dryer I didn't
bring one down to show you because I
think you have nothing it's like I got
one for Christmas and I asked one
because I've been chiming one
somewhere I had one for about four or
five months over summer and I just
totally fell in love with it I can't
seem to go back to my old head right now
if you want to hear me talking about it
in lot more detail I'll leave my wife up
for Christmas and also my full at Dyson
supersonic review video down below I
truly love it
so many people ask me if it's worth it
yes it is I personally would spend my
own money on it I would have done if I
hadn't have asked you for Christmas so
yeah really really love that my hair
loves it and seems to super hair dryer
and also random I wanted to include
invisible walls because this year was
the year that I really first discovered
invisible and I have not looked back so
I thought I'd include them not only for
going to the gym I wear them out and
about my favorites are this one which is
actually a breast cancer special it's
pink one little gold disc and then also
the gold ones which work really well
with my hair because they kind of are
invisible but most importantly there's
only many kinks in my hair personally I
love to have my hair up it's pretty much
only when I was filming videos I have my
hair down my hair just gets in the way
and annoys me and in business bubbles
that don't leave against in the hair and
they don't snag it they cause any
breakage so I've really been loving them
this year I have loose floating around
on my makeup bags or my handbags they
always one of my wrists too so I thought
I'd include those in my annual favorites
also within haircare I had to include
the Michel van Clark hair brush I now
have the full size version and the
handbag version of this and if you have
naughty hair or you find your hair hard
to brush after you get out the shower
you need to try this
I never paragraph either I can't lie but
I find this one a lot more ergonomic I
find it easier to hold and I find that
the shape of the Bristol area just used
to work a lot better and the fact that
it is this shape makes it a lot better
for traveling it's a lot more compact
this detangled my hair like nothing I've
ever tried before it's still really
gentle the bristles aren't too stiff
like a few other detangling brush and I
tried so it's still really gentle on my
head but if you tangled my hair in no
time at all and I absolutely love it
once again
lioness doesn't give me any static I
really don't know how much else to say
about this other than I really really
love it and if you struggle from naughty
hands and then love the tangle teezer
give it a try
okay going to the very last few products
now this one is maybe not beauty
products or a skincare or haircare
products but it's certainly not a
fashion product so I thought I'd include
it in this one it's the this works deep
deep plus pillow spray charlie 9 uses
every single night or the actual little
white I think it's called a diffuser
that puzzles out amazing scent into our
bedroom we used one of the two every
night and I don't know whether it's a
placebo effect but it really does help
us both get the most amazing deep sleep
when I travel I take the little one with
me without Charlie especially if I'm
feeling a little bit uneasy then it's
just spritzing some of this on my pillow
reminds me of home and makes me feel
instantly more relaxed so because I do
use this every single night and I didn't
have spoken about it that much so I
would include that in my annual
favorites and last but not least a
couple of perfumes I've worn so many
perfumes this year but these are the two
that I've gone back to time and time
again and I would say on my top - first
of all no surprise bitch from royal
flower bomb I've been wearing this and I
was about 17 years old
it became my you know whenever someone
smelt Flowerbomb they just that reminds
me of Josie which I really really loved
it became from my fence and this year I
got the limited edition of Mother's Day
edition with his beautiful hand-painted
Florida finally I hope they do it again
next mother takes it really in
spectacular but yeah flour bombs
probably will always be my signature
fragrance I just love it so so so much
and also to change things up a little
bit this summer I really love the
Guerlain terracotta and liftoff from
this one comes right now so just go in
myself as well bomb but it really is a
beautiful summery sense when I spray it
it reminds me of really warm holidays
like going to Greece going to Croatia I
think I wore it on those two trips so it
always brings back fond memories I'm
really bad at describing perfumes I'm
not going to attempt it to think of the
length of this video but it's a really
fabulous summer fragrance and I really
loved wearing that one
