kindly French Pat my hair just it's so
hot I kind of don't want it all lying
around my neck and I've just put some
zoeva what does it call car number matte
lipstick my lips
Sunny's arm and then this is my outfit
today got my little jacket as well I
will try and show you property later can
take my wife L bag so we are ready to go
Motoko the alator loma big narubu so
we're currently stuck in traffic trying
to get to the main Golf Course pavilion
area in the Wentworth estate we're
currently just enjoying the view of
these insane houses so as well as like
obviously being a famous golf club
Wentworth is also home to a lot of very
very fancy homes and which currently
trying to Google how much I work on
night Frank but I think it's just me
price on application yeah I'll just show
you a few more houses because I'm
serious house lost what you can join
this one is just a seeking perfection
yeah I'll coffee please Emily I know I
don't know if I like how perfect they
are so my record I don't on the river
extra hard or mission or to me I
wouldn't say no if I would anything for
me
we've seen in to explore the
championship Pavillion
we are going to have lunch later with
the team from Nespresso who are the
people that kindly invited us along
Jason King espresso Charlie couldn't
event me just picked it up we have to
get that warm water around story so now
what we're going to do is find a golfer
doesn't matter who someone and we're
going to follow them around the course
to check around the game yeah Charlie
was trying to explain the basic rules to
me earlier Josie Josie asked if hey
under was a hole-in-one
sounds like a logical question
hello again so the last time I've logged
was at the Gulf at Wentworth you guys I
think for me and going to get my lunch
which was absolutely incredible we had
such a fabulous day as you can tell none
of the Gulf anymore and back home and
it's actually Tuesday now so we had a
delicious lunch of a Gulf we met all the
team from espresso and then we went out
and watched a few more rounds and then
the heavens open that started pouring
with rain we didn't have a Brawley so we
headed back to Charlie's mom and dad's
house and just had have dinner there's a
really chill day now it's back to work
after the lovely bank holiday weekend so
what I thought I would do is turn this
into a kind of multi-day vlog I've been
seeing quite for you youtubers doing
like three or four days in a vlog and I
really enjoy watching them I think it's
mainly a better idea than the daily vlog
something is felt in May you guys get to
see more of the highlights over a few
days instead of seeing me waking up
going to Jim so my using routine every
single day so I predict that that could
get a little bit boring so let me know
what you think to the new format if I do
this maybe once a week or once every
couple of weeks to show you like the
highlights
so today I've got a day full of meetings
I'm also going to the dentist or to
smile direct headquarters to talk about
if I can improve my teeth any further
and look at teeth journey that I've been
on some that you know what goes on there
but for now this morning I've got a
couple of meetings a breakfast meeting
and then I think I might have Italian
look into a few shops and I've got lunch
meeting and early afternoon meeting and
then I'm going to dentist so yeah it
goes along with me but my
scraped back today I feel like a bit of
an old-school ballerina it was fun and
but I washed my hair it was perfectly
clean and then I put in a new oil which
I thought I would try turns out it's not
oil that you have to wash out so it's
really really sick I wouldn't have time
to wash my hair again so I just got like
annoying really oily and sounds
disgusting no idea anyway it's just
going to need clock my breakfast is at
9:00 so better get going okay I'm back
home again I feel like I didn't film
anything that while I was out in town
space so apologies about that but my
last appointment today in Long Acre
cotton Carden was with your smiles Iraq
and they are the guys that did my player
braces and I pretty much finished with
my bottom aligners my bottom teeth are
just pretty much perfectly straight now
I'm so happy with the entire process but
I actually wanted to get a little bit
more work done on my top teeth I wanted
to get them pushed back a little bit
because from the side I'm still a little
bit goofy and since I made my own molds
for the bottom teeth quick recap if you
haven't heard about my braids journey
but basically my bottom teeth were
really quite jagged and I didn't want to
train tracks and Invisalign the company
which is too expensive is like 4000
pounds and then I heard about your smile
direct and their service you basically
what you used to do was do it at home so
you didn't have to go to a dentist you
didn't have to pay any middleman fees
and it's just over 1,100 pounds I think
it's one $1.99 so it's literally a
quarter of the price of these like
Invisalign treatments but pretty much
the exact same thing definitely needs
back same results so I was really amazed
by this whole service had it on my
bottom teeth and just so happy with it
could not be more thrilled with the
results it's taken like six months and
my bottom teeth is just so much
straighter if you want to have a good
laugh then go back to my old videos and
just see how wonky my bottom teeth are
just you know one of those things that
may not be a big deal to some people
like on lookers but for me and also like
editing videos I would always see my
teeth I was like oh my gosh I would just
be so much happier if they were straight
up so amazing process and ways to do
something to improve my top teeth and
they now have a new system so you used
to get like two balls of like putty
thank to your door you mix it together
at home and when you put it in a model
with you make your own molds you send it
off to the company and then they send
you like a video of how your teeth are
going to move they found that a lot of
the time these molds for getting like
locked in the post you just can't rely
on silly Royal Mail and DPD these days
so they now have a new option where you
can go to a local I think we call it
smile factory and they have them in
London common garden they have them in
Birmingham Manchester and lots of other
cities and this is why I had done today
so you basically have this big
contraption in your mouth and hold your
mouth open and then the dentist sprays
it's not like a dentist office it's like
a nice office she sprays your teeth with
like a liquid or like a spray-on
toothpaste and then scans your teeth so
there's like this movie like a giant
toothbrush it goes in your mouth and she
moves it around your piece and as she's
doing that you can see on this giant
iPad screen that it's creating a digital
scan of your teeth I wish I'd recorded
it it was so clever and after she's done
that took like ten minutes then she had
the computerized version of my teeth on
her screen and from that they're going
to use like the software to figure out
how my kids are going to move and then
send me the video and then when I'm
happy with it and approve it they then
send my braces so yeah I'm really
excited to get even more improvement
dynamic peace on my top teeth and other
ways I will keep you guys updated on the
process that some external neighbor
doing some change touring outside I
guess I won't be filming video today and
the yes I just got home I'm going to sit
down my nook top
Charlie has set up our new Nespresso
machine while I've been away
and this one has a milk frother which
are autumn didn't so I'm going to give
that a go so do make myself coffee and
then social into the afternoon it's four
o'clock and I've got a lot of work to do
perfectly
like a foot
okay let's give it a try I'm impressed
with how Robbie this is to start with I
feel like I have tried so many different
ways of getting proper frothy coffee at
home and none of them have given me
anything quite this frothy oh my
goodness that is actually better than
restaurant cappuccino they've got a
little song buddy trying to jump up on
the sofa to join me what do you think
him joining us Dexter shall we allow it
yes my handsome boy
Oh
okay so it is now the next day I feel
like with these weekly vlogs I'm going
to have to get used to somehow doing a
better transition because otherwise you
guys are just going to see random
snippets from random days and but as you
may be able to tell I'm a little bit
more bronze than when you last saw me
I've had a spray tan today I went to my
favorites I went to the Vita Liberata a
little pop-up which is in the benefits
drawing support that was a puppy cry and
benefit economy street has the Vita
graphed a little station downstairs I
went there I'll try and show you a
picture my downline without being rude
but yeah really love this color because
we are off to a boil obviously Madrid
tomorrow and I just really wanted to get
a nice tan because we're not really
going to have time Sunday that's a city
trip so so I get a little bit bronzed
before I go really really happy with
this color looks really lovely and
natural but before that I also had a
meeting with a lovely girl at benefit
and I thought it might be quite
interesting to go through my goodie bag
with you so when bloggers meet PRS
they're often extremely generous and
give us some new products to try out and
benefit are some of the most generous in
the whole industry I have this ginormous
swag bag and I just kind of made that
term a progenitor thing but it looks
like there's some amazing things in here
I thought I'd show you some of the
highlights
first of all boying is one of my
favorite concealers I normally use it
under my eyebrow bone it is really
sharpen up the eyebrows really look and
creamy long-lasting but also mega
strength
so they've repackaged in a beautiful
pink packaging this one is their
industrial-strength concealer and then
this one I think is more of a moosie
yeah this is an airbrush concealer so a
new consistency of boiling which I'm
really excited to try then I've got one
of my favorites the goof proof brow
pencil that's ones I use almost on a
daily basis I've got my favourites this
is the benefit roller lash mascara in
brown and black I had run out of the
brown one so very happy to have a top of
that I've also because as you guys know
my skin is a little bit on the shiny
side I've got the Porefessional primer
which is amazing space to your makeup
keep you matte all day and then
professional Agent Zero shine which is
like you can just keep that in your
handbag and tap it on any areas you
might be getting a little bit shiny
highbrow glow pencils this one has a
little highlight underneath it you can
really just illuminate underneath the
brow bone
this I'm intrigued to try this is hoola
zero tanlines I remember seeing benefits
amazing vlogger trip I think they took
below two American brothers to Hawaii to
launch it looked insane so if I didn't
have a spray tan on already I would
definitely bring this with me I think
I'll save this until my next trip and
it's just going to give me the most
wonderful buffed and bronzed glow
gosh so many things then we've got hoola
quickie contour stick that I have not
tried before but I'm guessing it's going
to be through the color been like a
cream contour stick so excited to try
that cover out this is the cream gel
browser this one is a little bit like
the anastasia dipbrow big fan of that
browsing 'he's obviously benefits like
number one brow band brow brand they
have so many products this is the worst
I think this is the eyeshadows yes it's
got two different shadows in that and a
gel it's obstructing the brows gimme
brow we all know and love I talked about
this and like every video I'm doing my
brows so I don't need to remind you
about that one this is I think this is a
gala fornia blush which have not tried
either really like retro snazzy
packaging and it's kind of like a peachy
pink shade so truthfully will be very
much my color going to last few pieces
hoola light so everyone's favorite
bronzer hula is now available in a
lighter lighter lighter more ashy shade
can't wait to try that I'm going to put
that in my urgently must-try file and
precisely my brow pencil again I use
this nearly every day it's just a
roll-up brow pencil with a spoolie on
one end and the crown and the other so
very very handy and have got another
Boyne this is the brightening concealer
so I'm guessing this allowed to be a few
shades lighter good
under the eyes and then two products
here one of these foaming MacLean facial
wash and refined finished facial polish
I've not tried benefit skincare before
so really looking forward giving these
ago I'll keep you guys updated a little
ways so now it's about half past seven
in the evening I have got a whole room
sort of mess full of shopping and full
of well I can't find it though York
Times really challenging shopping and
bloggers mail so I'm just going to have
a massive unboxing session I also have
two packs of fame because honey one
started and we're leaving super early in
the morning so yeah packing unboxing a
little bit of work a little bit emails
and my mom is arriving any second to
take the doggies away because she's
looking awesome so yeah I'm gonna do
some other Mellon boxing and I'll show
you just a highlight okay so please
excuse the mess in the background but
before my mom gets here I've opened
maybe two-thirds of my vlog amount and
it quickly runs through a few of my
favorite pieces so I just opened up this
amazing box from Rimmel so it says the
Cara camo collection and then inside
we've got this like camo print with
fabric and I'm revealed inside is this
camouflage print hello Dexter any
rustling is Dexter now starting to my
brother melt so those the Rimmel classic

blush and a coffee and then the brow
this way has been rebranded you've got
the concealer stick a lipstick which is
in this beautiful kind of slushy nude
shades definitely need to try that one
on and then we've got a mascara and a
brow highlight we've all been like
repackaged with this camera
print on them in collab with good old
cara another blog amount which is really
exciting came wrapped up in this which
is a traditional Japanese cotton cloth

all the benefits of the usual diaphragm

tanning products from tan at lux

and that's meant to help you get natural
tan and also the tanning facial serum
