vlog so today's vlog is starting off on
a Tuesday afternoon I'm currently in the
lovely rosewood hotel I'm here tonight
with origins for a lovely bloggers
sleepover we're here for the launch of
three new products in their original
skin collection which I'm very excited
to show you I've actually just tried
some of them out I had a facial a second
ago and they used the mask the new
cleansing jelly the new primer which is
amazing it's like a cooling foam primer
and also a matte moisturizers and my
skin is ready for makeup I still have my
old and eyeshadow one that I've had on
all day so I might just sort that out
but yes the lovely blogger sleepover
tonight
and I had Freddy and Jess in my room
earlier we attempted to start this vlog
earlier but it was a bit of an epic fail
I will show you what I mean now that's
what happens when you guys ready to
start your day
welcome to a new weekly vlog slightly
different starts usual I am with Jeff
and Freddie and we are having a sleeper
we're having a sleepover tonight at the
Rose worth with origins and that was
Freddie talking to the dog so yeah lots
of the girls are here tonight we've got
a lovely dinner to look forward to
earlier on today
you don't really miss too much I didn't
film or vlog earlier today because I
just had various meetings but I will
show you what fun things we get up to
tonight and then Freddie and I are also
off to a charity event this evening as
well which will be really good fun it's
for The Naked Heart Foundation and it's
called a fund for fun with a day fund
Fair at Camden roundhouse so very busy
evening so I'm gonna make myself a
coffee the girls are going to come back
in a second
to get ready so I will see you when we
are ready to go down for a cocktails
okay so just finish getting ready for
dinner I'm gonna show you a quick outfit
of the evening I am wearing a casual
knit top this is from Club Monaco it's
got a really lovely kind of scalloped
detail on the neckline which I love and
then this is a new skirts which I have
from coast you may have spotted this if
you saw my spring trend video because I
mentioned how sheer is a big trend and
pearls and this is both of those so
that's that I've got on underneath and
then I'm wearing my lovely Valentino
Rockstar shoes and I'm taking my
aspinall bag this one actually has not
come out with me since Christmas it's a
bit of a mixture of metals I have rose
gold studs on the shoes and the bag is
silver but I don't really mind and I
think it's really really cute and then
makeup wise my skin is looking fabulous
after all those origins lovely products
with a facial I have used a Tom Ford
highlighter which is looking good
normally I don't follow it with
highlight but actually I really like how
this looks so this is my outfit of the
evening and just waiting for Freddy and
Jess to come and knock on my door and
we're all heading down for cocktails
I can now study was the
my stay
Oh
I think I don't want you me pretty good
for it you gave me that smile we stood
there for a while when you
good morning darlings um so I thought I
would catch up with you on last night's
events while I do my morning skincare
I'm going to be using of course the new
origins original skin products I did
also do it get unready with me last
night but I did it on my Instagram
stories so I thought I would share it
with you this morning
so this is not real first impressions I
have tried them all big fans so far so
first of all I'm going to be using the
original skin that cleansing makeup
removing jelly and this has got
willow-herb in it consistency wise it's
like a very soft jelly as you can
imagine and this helps to dissolve any
makeup obviously I've just woken up so
that any makeup on but it also has some
flower oil in there which just gets into
the pores it gets rid of any excess oil
so this is just a really lovely one for
in the mornings massage that in so last
night we had an amazing dinner here at
the rosewood the whole theme for tonight
is that it's cool AF and they had this
amazing ice sculpture and minute table
with the new original skin products in
there and then we had these ice themed
cocktails and then a three-course dinner
which was absolutely delicious start it
was really healthy as well we had like a
seaweed you know machine starter and
then we had I had cuz I didn't have a
fish cause it was a lovely kind of
asparagus and quinoa and then also the
ingredient from this window herb was
also in our main course so that was
really lovely and then dessert was this
amazing pink ice cream mousse sculpture
which was the same color and same kind
of consistency as the cleansers that was
really really really cool just getting a
bit of water on my hands now
and turning the cleanser into like a
milk which is just feels so pampering I
also used the cleanser last night to get
rid of all my makeup and it was just so
easy getting rid of waterproof eye
makeup literally just one swipe and it
was
gone so that just leaves the skin
feeling peachy soft very fresh I'm gonna
Pat it dry with a clean up hole next I'm
going to use the essence lotion this is
already in the original skin connection
it's not one of the new products the
girl that was giving me my facial
yesterday so it's actually better to
apply toning products with the hands or
the fingertips because a cotton wool pad
can just absorb everything which isn't
that good I find these types of products
are just a real nice way of finishing
off the Pens and I just feel like my
skin is super clean gives it some nice
radiance and just feels really really
fresh as well unlike my hair which
clearly is not fresh this morning
next up also from the original skin and
this is the renewal serum again this is
not a new product
I'm a big fan of this serum it feels
really really lightweight but instantly
you just feel it hydrating and calming
the skin which I absolutely love all
year round and the consistency oh it
just feels like it's really getting the
skin to the optimal state ahead of
wearing makeup next up some eye cream
this is from the ginseng collection this
has got caffeine or coffee bean in there
helps to wake up the eye area and it's
also got kind of little tiny micro pearl
parts in there to brighten as well as
deep Hough so I just Pat that underneath
the eye area not getting too close and
finally I'm going to apply the new
moisturizer this is the original skin
matte moisturizer with willow-herb so
this is the most amazing formula it's
like kind of like a gel cream as opposed
to a really super creamy moisturizer so
great at absorbing oil if you do have
oily skin that then this is amazing for
that
it feels lightweight but also incredibly
hydrating it makes the skin almost look
more flawless straight after application
and because it has got that matte finish
it's just perfect for applying before
makeup you don't have to wait around for
your moisturizer to sink in
it has slight blurring effects as well
so if you've got big pores
like I do anyone that lives in a
polluted city has visible pores then
this just very delicately blows them
okay so that is my skincare done I'm now
going to do my makeup don't need to wait
around for the moisturizer to sink in
I'm going to use my usual makeup routine
starting with bare minerals bare Pro so
I'm not going to go through this step by
step but so after the origins dinner
Freddie and I hopped in a taxi and we
went to the Camden roundhouse and we
went to the Naked Heart Foundation fund
Fair which is a charity events The Naked
Heart Foundation was started by
supermodel Natalia Vodianova and she is
the face of girl and so Galan invited us
along to the event last night and as you
saw from the clips the counting
Roundhouse it has been taken over all
luxury brands had taken over spaces in
the Roundhouse and they were putting on
kind of tombola style stools you could
win designer keychains you could win
fragrances you could win makeup and all
to raise money for the Naked Heart
Foundation which helped children with
disabilities they help provide education
for children that maybe need a little
bit of extra support if they've got a
learning difficulty and have maybe
social skills that they just need a
little bit of help with The Naked Heart
Foundation to do that all over the world
because they are raising awareness and
raising money and it's just so lovely to
see so much support so many brands with
their supporting whether that was with
products or with celebrities being there
to raise awareness and I mean the prizes
on these stores you could win like you
could win ship launching handbags you
could win Fendi Hamburg Fendi keychains
Galan had a store where you had to guess
the different notes in their fragrance
and if you guess the notes right then
you win there this big goodie bag full
of the Latin fragrances and kalam makeup
so a really amazing evening there was
even a wheel of fortune which I think to
give you an idea of the scale of this
event I think to play the wheel of
fortune you had to have token that there
was 10,000 pounds so serious serious
donations going on
yeah I did hear over the loudspeaker at
one point that they'd raised that they
hit the hundred thousand pound mark so a
lot of money was raised last night which
is really really incredible so Freddie
and I stayed there for a couple of hours
and hopefully you'll have seen from the
clips just how amazing it was just such
an incredible night the kind of thing
that would have taken so much effort to
organize so for an entire year to do
that it's just incredible such an
amazing cause that was really good fun
I'm going to whiz through the last of my
makeup now as I finished my coffee and
then I'm gonna head downstairs capture
with the origins girls again for
breakfast I have to say my makeup is
going on so nicely after the moisturizer
good morning it is now Thursday I didn't
finish vlogging at all yesterday after
doing my skincare because it's new viva
zombie mode I find that after going to
bed anytime after 11 o'clock really I
tend to be a bit worse on me so
yesterday I was working from home
nothing very exciting today however we
have gone to the London Fashion Week
festival at strand and saw some lovely
catwalk shows had some amazing macht
hills and cocktails and
on route to a vixen Ralph's Bridal
events for going for afternoon tea at
the Ellen cafe which is a blogger
favorite so yes I will take it on to
that I'll see you there okay so just
arrived and is as predictably persons
are always have a huge queue up to
wagons coming back
super photogenic shots but I'm going to
show you what's going on ever have a
little tea and then very fellow
bride-to-be and then we are going to
have a new fragrance a new Viktor and
Rolf is next to fragrances let me show
you so you just had our treats come
through and M is not sharing
Emma's given up giving up so this is
rather magical we've now come to the
Browns bride's door and beautiful
wedding dresses all in one place so I
think we get to just try if you want to
I remember those days we were young and
now nothing to do I used to pick you up
and child two days we could talk for
hours so Tesla is trying on a fictional
town so this is one of the beautiful
Viktor and Rolf gowns I would say this
is like an evening sparkling dress we
did have the opportunity to try on the
full-length ones but I think I want my
moment bridesmaids to be there for that
so this is an evening option so just
your typical generic known test for
about an hour and already we're trying
on wedding dresses together
so beautiful these dresses divine and
look at this oh my goodness this is
spectacular do you feel like princess
can see this little guy on a bit faster
even care if you stay as we are at each
other or is at each other inside each
other
Sarah darling oh look at this oh you are
rocking your girlfriend to the chin
again
with you
just to see
Jassi head out to dinner now after our
fabulous day afternoon at Browns trying
on wedding dresses so much fun I thought
just as I've got this amazing
full-length mirror I'd quickly show you
my outfit of the day just scooped my
hair back because of that anymore and so
I'm wearing surprise surprise my Reis
coat and then underneath and my French
Connection jumper which I'm sure you
guys are very bored off by now but you
know the one that I mean then miry
stressors which go perfectly with the
coat

handbag and then jewelry wise we've got
the Monica vinegar hey there she is

and the little earrings so now we're
heading out to dinner restaurant ours
for a dinner to celebrate the launch of
fiction offs new nectar fragrance let's
go
so we've arrived at restaurant hours
which is in Knightsbridge
I cannot believe I've never been here
before this is like my kind of dream
restaurant it's really floral it's kind
of makes you want to come in evenings
because it's got my like fun party vibe
to it
I'm around to show you and then head
back into the room
so no
taystee what are you gonna help your
dinner Freddie
I'm gonna do
good morning it is now Friday morning
and I showed you some clips last night
of our dinner we went to restaurant
hours with Viktor and Rolf to celebrate
their new flower bon perfume of which I
have one here we had one in our goody
bags alongside the most amazing bouquet
of flowers and so this is the perfume
flower bomb nectar as you guys know I am
the world's biggest flower bomb fan and
this is the latest in the collections
always he you've got bloom you've got
the original you've got bonbon although
I don't know bonbon is no bomb one's not
actually flower bomb but this is so this
is like a tweak to the original flower
bomb it's a little bit sweeter it is of
course still super floral super feminine
but it's also got some amber and vanilla
in there which make it just a touch
sweeter I think if you are a lifelong
fan of flower bomb like I am then you're
just guaranteed absolutely love this
it's just I don't know there's something
a little bit more warm about it a little
bit more luxurious it's an intense ode
apart from a little bit more expensive
than the original but I can already tell
this is going to be my everyday
fragrance so huge huge fan about the
dinner itself was absolutely amazing
really good food lovely company just the
most fabulous day and before that as you
saw we were at Brown's price trying on
wedding dresses trying on Viktor and
Rolf wedding dresses
I just tried on the short ones because
as much as I was desperate to try on the
long ones and they were so magical they
were just honestly spectacular gowns but
I want that moment where I try on my
first proper wedding dress to be with my
bridesmaids and my mum so yeah I
refrained from trying on the long
dresses but the short ones that I did
try on it were spectacular the detail
and its really nice they had the victory
one-off details going through them like
the bows you had the flowers they were
like these perspex semi-sheer
semi-transparent flowers on some of them
which were incredible the embroidery in
the detailing was just yeah true works
of art so that was an amazing way to
spend the day and then we had an
afternoon tea at the Ellen cafe before
that as you guys saw so generally just
the most amazing day yesterday
so if you're watching Vikram Roth team
thank you very much I had just the best
day ever so much fun and I thought I
would just sit down with you now and do
a little bit more vlogger man unboxings
I have some lovely goodies in front of
me I just opened up this package from
Urban Decay and it's the naked heat
petite or naked petite heat palette and
they've put in these sunglasses which
are very retro oh my goodness I feel
like something out of a snapchat filter
you know that one and this is the
palette let's have a little look so it's
got some of the most wearable I would
say shades from the naked heat palette
which if you saw my Beauty clear-out
video you will have heard me say that I
use that part nearly every single day
we've got inhale if I break hot spell
Wild Thing heist and strike and I don't
think I've used wild thing that much
this really Ong one but definitely these
three are the ones I use all the time
and I really like small palettes because
pop them in your handbag your gym bag or
your travel bag and it's got a mirror in
the lid as well so really really handy
interesting this is water burst hydrated
gel moisturizer and this very strange
squidgy little bottle oh my god Wow
that is genius oh my goodness that has
blown my mind that is so clever so it's
like a little water bottle little water
bottle big water bottle oh my god that
is so clever how amazing for like in
your handbag or in your gym bag oh my
goodness so this is a new moisturizer
from glam glow waterless weightless
water cream with hydration technology 72
hours moisturizer 72 hours moisture
innovative formula immediately burst
into skin quenching water drops on
contact for hydration you can instantly
see and feel this is what it looks like
so it really is like a watery jelly
consistency and it smells incredible I
cannot wait to slather it all over my
face
thank you very much glam glow
super handy little water bottle as well
which is going to go straight into my
gym bag next we have a year times and my
Willis interesting so that's obviously
the latest celeb they're collaborating
with these look amazing supernatural I'm
not really like a big heavy full slash
girl but these look very very subtle
well goodness I'm going to show you some
place that see see what I mean I guess
you would use these for like corner
lashes or as an accent lash these ones
are called the insta belle lashes again
very very subtle and then you've got the
all the Aces collection this is probably
the most intense of the set but I like
that you've got like the full accent
lashes and then the corner ones as well
so you don't even need to have a full
set of lashes on if you don't want to
you got the choice which is amazing so
lovely new lashes from earlier I think
these are out now as well I have a
beautiful delivery from Michael Kors
fragrances this is the new Michael Kors
sheer fragrance I feel like the way to a
bloggers heart is literally by sending
flowers or biscuit ears either of those
I'm happy look at this so you've got all
of these roses these are real roses in
this box surrounding the Michael Kors
sheer fragrance ooh I think this might
be the empty box look how beautiful that
is and then you have the new fragrance
here it's like a pearly white bottle
really really beautiful bottle very
modern sniff oh wow oh my goodness
that's great that's quite a mature
fragrance like more mature than I think
of as the usual Michael cause ones it's
floral but in a much lighter way than
for example the nectar perfume I think
if you like your fragrances to be a
little bit more crisp then I would say
this is a very almost like fresh linen
kind of scent very very light I think
crisp is the best way to describe this
it feels smells really like clean and
fresh uplifting that is really really
nice and it's very strong as well I
literally did like one and a half
spritzes and that is
powerful that is a really gorgeous one
going straight to my dressing table I
just realized I actually have one more
blocker mellow it's in a box to the side
of my other parcels and it is this
amazing box from molten Brown
beautifully presented as always I feel
like molten Brown is just like the go-to
and you want to really spoil someone
with some lovely pampering products
let's see what we have inside firstly
this beautiful silk handkerchief silk
square looks like the tiles that you get
in like Spanish courtyards really really
beautiful and then gorgeous yellow
packaging for spring this is their
orange and bergamot collection radiant
body polish I absolutely love molten
Brown body polishes they are so good
when it comes to really giving yourself
a good scrub but it's not harsh at all
it's so lovely and often they're very
creamy as well as your skin is super
hydrated at the same time then we've got
the radiant body oil and radiant bathing
oil I absolutely love oils so this is a
dream oh it is London via Seville a
luminous dry oil imbued with civilian
neroli oil oh my goodness that melts
instantly into the skin leaving it silky
smooth and feeling nourish was a
beautifully dewy finish that sounds
absolutely dreamy oh my goodness I
cannot wait to bathe in the radiant
bathing oil later on and let's see I
think this is probably out now a
timeless gift for mum yes just ahead of
Mother's Day new editions launched on
the 15th of February set out now
molten Brown co uk absolutely gorgeous
okay I'm gonna go and do some work now
I'll see you later
good evening so it's now Friday evening
and I'm about to head to Vicky's house
Vicky and other friend Vicky and I are
gonna have a bit of a girly evening I've
got a bag full of pampering products and
board games are going to be playing
balderdash and Dax and ah Polly which is
Dax and monopoly and just have a really
nice chilled evening when we're going to
get some takeaway food put on some face
masks and have a good girlie evening so
I am just pretty much wearing what I've
been wearing all day and then this bag
is an amazing Buy
from Aurora it's got my initials on
there you can see and it's a red bag a
limited-edition bag that was given to me
as part of a collaboration with
Elizabeth Arden so next month Elizabeth
Arden are doing loads of things I think
the hashtag is let's March on and
they're going to be doing loads of
things around the confidence of red
lipstick and things like that so you'll
be hearing a lot more about that but
this is one gorgeous thing which they
very kindly sent to me so this is filled
with all of my goodies right now I'm
gonna put my trainers on and I will see
you at
I promise you to find your way back to
find someone is up it's all about you
will be able
and fly with me it's great dreams and
give you
good morning darlings it is Saturday
morning now so last night I went to
Vicky's house Vicky and other Vicky we
were all there playing dachshund
monopoly or dachshund Oakley it's
officially called just a really lovely
girlie evening and oh my goodness the
game was so fun it was very similar to
normal monopoly but instead you like you
go to kennel instead of going to jail
instead of getting a common run with the
normal Monopoly cards work but like the
cards that you pick up in the middle
they were good boy or bad boy and then
for example you if you get fleas you
have to put $200 in the middle things
like that it's a really really good fun
um I sadly lost I did an Instagram story
when I was down to my last three dollars
normally I'm really good at monopoly but
I got a bit carried away buying too many
dogs at beginning dogs are basically
properties so yeah I became bankrupt
very quickly but such a fun evening
today as you just soften that hyperlapse
I have been rejigging my beauty area and
I think this looks so lovely I actually
was sent an email full of disclosure
from this company and I believe they're
called Hollywood mirrors I'm gonna leave
a link to them down below because that
is such a generous thing to send me and
and they also wanted me to share a
discount code with you as well so I'm
gonna leave that on the screen and leave
that linked down below thank you so much
to those guys for sending this over you
can see my set up behind me it's not
totally done but I'm just gonna spend
the rest of the afternoon kind of
fitting about and making it perfect but
I thought I would just prop you up
seeing as my lighting set up now I mean
I don't know if you can tell but this
lighting for example I'm standing in
front of the mirror now this is the
lighting when I don't have it on there's
like a little dimmer switch and I can
choose how bright I want it to be so
this is with it off and then I'm putting
it on that's all the way to the
brightest I probably would never do my
makeup without its brightest is quite
harsh but if I just dim it down
it's like that kind of level absolutely
amazing it's gonna be such a
game-changing when it comes to doing my
makeup the light in this room this light
here is really dull so when I'm doing my
makeup I often go to the bathroom and
it's a bit of a pain in the bum because
all of my makeup is obviously here and
then I haven't filmed makeup videos in a
very long time because I really just
haven't liked how my skin's looked
because the lighting has been so bad so
yeah hopefully this is gonna be a bit of
a game changer and I love how big it is
I mean I can see pretty much my entire
outfit in this mirror and yes I've got
I've got my camera on its tripod because
I was just filming a time-lapse of me
blow-drying my hair speaking of which I
have been using
I haven't spoken about it for a long
time but I've been using the Dyson
hairdryer I think it's just called Dyson
air maybe you know what it is the Dyson
hairdryer and I have to tell you again
how much I absolutely love it I feel
like if you've got a lot of hair like I
do my hair is actually fine but it's
coloured it gets very very knotty it
takes a long time to blow-dry or it did
but I find the Dyson so quick I feel
like my hair is so soft with it and it's
just like a gentle blow-dry if that
makes sense like you feel it's much
quieter and you feel like the air is
going through the blow-dryer as opposed
to you get with a lot of normal hair
dryers so yeah I just really really like
it it's got different nozzles but I tend
to just leave this one on you can do
these buttons here are the strengths so
I'm gonna turn it on but you'll see the
lights here different strengths and
different heat let me show you
that's the lowest strength and then
that's the heat
so yeah big fan of that I feel like it
makes my hair soft it's quicker to
blow-dry it is an expensive device but
we use hair dryers every day or every
other day so no regrets with that one
absolutely love it so I'm just gonna
prop you guys up there and I'm going to
do my makeup I think this is going to be
the last thing I'm going to include in
this vlog because for the rest of the
day I'm just basically going to film
some videos I just had a big a sauce
order arrived so I'm going to film an a
sauce hawk it's been a while since I did
that I actually used for the first time
the DPD app and it's amazing I don't
know if you guys have ever done
mentioned it before or if you haven't
missed a sauce Parcells but basically um
can't show you too much because that is
literally my address right there
but for example it shows you all of your
orders this is not obvious of my DVD I'm
just thinking it's really useful and and
then it's gonna cover up my address
basically here is like a map and you can
track your driver I said him when he
came to the doors like you find that a
bit weird and he was like yeah it's
really intense people know exactly where
I am and but for example I could see
where he pulled up when it said he was
five minutes away and I was like you
went and got a coaster didn't you and he
was like yes I did that's so weird but
super handy because I could have dashed
out and or I could have like got in the
shower knowing that he was 20 minutes
away so that was great highly recommend
giving the DPD app can you imagine if it
was sponsored by the DPD app that's
hilarious I'm not um okay so I've
blow-dried my hair to about 90% as I'm
gonna be filming later I'm going to be
doing a little bit more of an intense
makeup look I did try out the Giorgio
Armani face fabric the other day but
actually I found that my skin oxidized a
little bit so I'm gonna go with one that
I know which is of course my bare
minerals there Pro Foundation a huge
huge fan of this pop a pump on the back
of my hand
and if anyone's tried this with great
success then let me know how you applied
it do you use a sponge or a brush or did
you use any specific moisturiser
beforehand
because I've heard so many people
literally rave about it so much and it
must be amazing but I don't know I just
didn't get along with it very well which
is a real shame because most Giorgio
Armani foundations I adore but yeah this
Bare Minerals bear pro you guys know how
much I love this ask so many skincare
benefits I saw Mike a stuck record
because I talk about it all the time but
the more you use it the better your skin
gets because it has so many skin loving
ingredients in there it's also
anti-pollution high coverage really long
where it gives I would say it gives a
really full coverage which is why I love
wearing it for filming you can see even
since I started playing a few seconds
ago my skin looks so much better
I find it goes on really well and
actually I prefer how my skin looks the
longer I wear it so for example if I
check the mirror at the end of the day
I'll actually be even happier with how
my skin looks then I was when I first
applied it which is great so I always
use a Beauty Blender and I find that
that gets really even coverage this
mirror lighting is so good so I'm going
in with concealer next and bareMinerals
have actually extended the bear pro
range and there is now bear Pro
concealers which is amazing
got really weird foundation lips um in
fact I put on lip balm these are my
favorites at the moment I just loved him
two lip balms this is from Galan hmm
means I look like lesser zombie when I'm
doing my makeup and my lips are nicely
nourished for applying lipstick later
yep so bare minerals have extended their
bare pro range after the huge success of
the foundation there was already the
powder which is this one here I feel
like many many people know and love this
powder a lot this one oh I have a brand
new and I actually met the P alpha
member not bad minerals the other day
she gave me a new one my old one is a
little bit more battered is in my
handbag but there is now a concealer I
feel like I've been leading up to that
point for so long this one's slightly
lighter than my skin color so I'm gonna
use my finger just to brighten that area
by the eyes I feel like my skin can be
quite grey here
want anything too cakey this is a stick
concealer so it's really high coverage
but it doesn't crease it doesn't oxidize
it doesn't clog up your pores so it's
not too heavy for around the eye area
but it really does brighten and give an
even complexion let me know in the
comments below if you like these kind of
get ready with me skincare and makeup
things within my vlogs because I know I
don't really do full-on makeup videos
anymore because I just I just don't know
why you'd want to watch me doing a
makeup video I'm not a makeup artist and
there are so many people out there that
do the most amazing makeup so yeah I
don't feel the need to do them but I do
get a lot of questions about what makeup
I'm wearing what skincare so I thought
it'd be quite nice to just do it in
weekly vlogs and then it's a bit more
relaxed you still get to see what I'm
using but it's not like me trying to
preach about skincare and makeup because
that's not where my expertise lies so
let me know if you like this kind of
format and I shall continue doing
updates like this in my weekly vlog but
as I said this is kind of my makeup
routine for when I'm filming so it is a
lot heavier than I'd use in an everyday
basis I'm gonna use the lemare powder
next this one again similar to bare
minerals products it's good for the skin
so I don't feel like I'm clogging up my
skin in any way um it's a pressed powder
so really really easy to apply good for
just sticking in the handbag as well and
this will just prevent any shininess
from developing so then I'm going in
with another bare minerals product this
is the invisible bronze if you've seen
any of my makeup routines lately you
will probably be predicting this ahead
of me doing it Charlotte Tilbury bronzer
brush and this bronzer I use kind of all
over just to really warm up my entire
complexion and then I might go in with a
darker one for creating a bit more shape
to the face
I really wish bareMinerals would bring
out a tinted lip balm I feel like they
are the queens and kings of nude makeup
like really natural-looking and that's
good for you so it seems like the
natural thing to do but their middles if
you're watching please bring how to tend
to lip balm
right next I'm going to do my actually
going to finish off my complexion so I'm
going to use one more bareMinerals
product it's a new blusher they have a
huge range of blushes in there Jen nude
collection this one is that peach though
they've all got really cool like
gangster names that peach though and I'm
going to use my duo fiber brush this one
is from Sigma duo fiber powder brush f15
I find that this picks up the perfect
amount of product and this is a really
lovely kind of spring peachy very fresh
color quite subtle you can build it up
but I like my blush to be very subtle um
the other one of these they sent this
humongous box actually the most
beautiful box full of blushes I cannot
keep all of them I have actually got a
few sets aside for giveaways but the
other one that I've kept in my everyday
collection is beige for days and it is
this almost brownie pink and I really
really like that one as well that's
that's probably more of an everyday
whereas this is kind of filming and when
I want a little bit more of a makeup
look so love those and just to finish
off my complexion because I'm filming
I'm adding a touch of highlight same one
that I've used for a long time this one
is Tom Ford
Sally bloom and the most beautiful rose
gold packaging if you saw my makeup
decluttering video you'll have heard me
say that I don't really use highlight
that often so I actually chucked out or
passed on to friends 90% of my
highlighters I had maybe like I don't
know 10 and I only really use this one
and then I also kept my YSL Touche Eclat
glow shots because that was a little bit
different and yeah I just tend to only
use this one really really like it love
Tom Ford so that's a keeper and now that
my complexion is done what I tend to do
next is use a makeup setting mist or
something that's just gonna pack it all
around this is the quarterly beauty
elixir which I adore really refreshing
and oh my goodness it's just surgery me
so yeah when I finished my base I talked
to you
either this or the Armani fixing glow or
mac fix+ quite a few different products
in there okay
can speed through the rest of it I'm
going to do my brows and I'm gonna use
actually I'm going to use the Dior Dior
show brows styler
looks like this this is quite new to my
collection so I'm still giving it a
whirl that highlight looks insane um so
as you can see that's just helped me to
fill in my brows create a little bit
more color to them fill out any gaps cuz
my brows are really patchy my brow shape
is fairly oh my brow shape is fairly
rubbish to tell the truth I've always
struggled with my brows but I just use
products that have quite a fine nib to
just kind of fill in hair like strokes
to build up the shape I really ought to
pay attention in like a brow master
classes and things I feel like that
would do my face a whole lot of good in
fact you might try and get my brows done
this evening because they are a little
bird and then I'm going to use one of
the new hourglass products these are the
hourglass brow volumizing fiber gel so
there's not only sets the brows but it
has little tiny fibers in there which
helps to add volume so if you have very
sparse brows like I do it's really
wonderful I could spend hours trying to
perfect my brows but I really just there
are lost cause I just don't really
bother with them and now what I'm gonna
do I have been influenced by an
influencer I've had this in my
collection for a long time but I've
almost been a little bit scared and not
sure how to use it but then I was
watching Victoria in the fros Fashion
Week vlog the other day she used in it
looked spectacular it's a Tom Ford cream
and powder eye color in the shade oh one
naked bronze she looked incredible so
she's a lot more chance at doing her
makeup than I am but I'm gonna give it a
go and I'm going to use a zoeva luxe eye
blender so this is like a cream at the
bottom here and I'm just gonna pack that
onto my eyelid well okay I've made that
quite messy need to blend that out I'm
gonna do the eye other
first it's really funny because normally
I'd be like oh there really is no point
in spending that amount of money on an
eye shadow product but then when you
actually try these I mean not all luxury
brands but with Tom Ford like their
lipsticks their fragrances I do actually
think they're worth the investment like
this is just you wouldn't get this
effect from a more affordable palette I
really don't think you would it's just
the most perfect shades that you can
tell that you can really see that it's
like such rush it's a shade that's been
so well developed to create the most
perfect brownie bronze color and oh my
goodness love hopefully this'll have
really good lasting power I'm gonna use
a crease brush just to really smooth out
the edges and now my mascara I'm just
gonna curl the lashes these lash curlers
are a Borean and I think they're really
pretty and they work very well I'm sure
I don't know if they are a Borean they
came with a newborn blogger Mouser
probably but they're good the pre-op
ones are good too and I'm using bad gal
mascara from benefit so much hype but I
genuinely love this mascara I really
really love it take a look at my lashes
now they're non-existent pretty much one
coat of mascara two coats of mascara no
mascara
and I've just done a little bit of
wiggling and you can see that the volume
is rather incredible right so I've added
it to both of my eyes now hopefully you
can see my lashes looking very very
dramatic you could go really overboard
and make them a lot thicker and add even
more volume but to be honest I find that
this is all that I really want when it
comes to my lashes yeah big big fan of
those really big fan of this lighting
setup I feel like normally you can't
even see a difference when I'm putting
my makeup on slash it just looks rather
rubbish
but I love this here's without natural
light coming from the window with it
full blast to bright I think that's
about perfect okay so the last thing I
will do my lipstick at the very very end
last thing before filming is curling my
hair and I'm going to be using my steam
pod which you might be able to hear is
just about ready
and I basically curl with the steam pod
using the exact same technique as you
would with say ghd's for example and I
just find it the curls look a little bit
more natural I still love my ghd's don't
get me wrong and I'm traveling obviously
this is ginormous so I always take my
ghd's when I go for any overnight stays
but I find that this is I just feel like
it's a bit better for my hair I don't
know if that's true or not but as you
can see it does create lovely little
curls so charlie is in Mauritius at the
moment so I have the whole weekend to
myself
hence the filming gala that I would
normally not do on the weekends because
normally China I'd be out I think I'm
gonna see some friends this evening
tomorrow I'm gonna do loads of editing
so that Georgia so I have a lovely
girlie called Georgia who is helping me
out now and she can fill out my youtube
description boxes tomorrow and not
tomorrow on Mondays I'm gonna get those
all edited for her I haven't heard from
charlie since he left yesterday some
kind of eagerly waiting a message from
him hopefully they landed safely
so yeah he's in Mauritius with all of
our Brown who makes swimming trunks you
might have seen he wore these swimming
trunks with pictures of Dexter and
Dickens on them so this brand you can
also personalize swimming trunks but
they're really cool because the trunks
themselves when they dry they look just
like really smart shorts so you can wear
them to the beach bar you can wear them
for lunch generally just really nice
designs charlie loves them so they
wanted to take him out to Mauritius to
shoot some pictures I mean he is living
the dream honestly I'm so proud of him
so yeah just home alone although I did
have two boys in my bed last night hmm
such a hussy I'm obviously talking about
dykes from Dickens by the way see I'm
just like hurling this ginormous
contraption in the same way that you
would Co any other hair straighteners
and it uses steam as well as a plate so
I have got this pod down there which is
filled with water which generates steam
and it helps your car to last longer
helps keep the hair in good condition
sometimes I'll go in the next day with
my ghd's and like freshen up the curls
you can't get like ringlets e-type curls
but I really like how this looks see I'm
gonna stop rambling cuz this videos
gonna be long and I will show you the
finished look in a second I still have
not mastered the art of where you can
curl your hair away from your face I've
tried it so many times but I feel like
when I just add hairspray and mess it
all up it looks fine so that's so I tend
to just leave it in the curls that I've
just created for like 10-15 minutes I'll
probably go and brush my teeth because
I've just finished off my coffee and
then I will apply my lipstick I'm going
to use Laura Mercier lip liner this is a
really nice color it is natural lips
natural lips lip pencil I don't know if
they have individual names but it's just
kind of like brownie pink color which I
love
then I will apply a course tomforde
sable smoke that's deep mink
first time actually I'm going to use
first time haven't worn that in a long
time and it's a really pretty pink color
which I feel like it's good for a spring
aithough school sneak peek so I'm gonna
go and brush my teeth and then I would
just do the final get ready with me bits
is it charlie
yay just landed long long journey slept
almost all the way through both flights
how's your day going how are my boys it
send him a picture of puppies right
teeth brushing time you don't need to
see that okay back again teeth and
brushed and my lips are nice and soft
because I had the bomb on earlier so I'm
gonna outline them I tend to go just
over my natural lip shape to make my
lips look a little bit bigger with a lip
liner oh my goodness I forgot how much I
love this Tom Ford lip color this is
first time and I think this is probably
the first Tom Ford lipstick that I
really fell in love with it's very me
don't you think kind of like a pinky
it's a brownie pink but it's quite pinky
love okay final step with the hair
reaching to my hair draw this is the way
soft hairspray so it's a hairspray once
it's a lightweight hold miss locks in
your hair shields hair from humidity not
that we have much of that but this is
what I'd like to use as my last step
okay and there we have it
this is my look for filming um I'm now
going to put on a different jumper
because this one's a little bit scruffy
I'm gonna keep my trousers on though
these my river island trousers that I
just slob around the house in something
I'm gonna end the vlog here because I'm
