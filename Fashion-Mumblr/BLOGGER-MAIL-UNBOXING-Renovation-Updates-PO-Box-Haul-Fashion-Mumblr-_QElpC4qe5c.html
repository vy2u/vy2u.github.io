daily vlog so it's Friday today and I am
working from home all day just mean to
the gym and had a meeting here in
Clapham so haven't gone too far from the
nest today it is full on building work
going on today so I'm here in the
kitchen this is my space for the day
keeping an eye on the gates because
we've got tons of people coming and
going and clicking them in lots of
deliveries and there's just so many
builders from out off today we've got
the guy doing bathroom we've got the
guys finishing off painting and then two
guys that are doing the carpets so
hopefully by the end of the day this
place is going to be looking a lot
better one of the rooms is done painted
and we got the carpets in and so after
I've done a few more emails I'll take
you upstairs to show you mums coming
over later as well just bringing back
the dogs got Coco Louie and Dexter
coming to stay because mums off to Spain
so I really hope all the carpet is done
by the end of the day because otherwise
it's not really safe for the dogs so
yeah I will show you around the house in
a few moments cut myself some lunch get
on with some work and then also I'm
going to show you load a blog email
later because China are going to go to
dawdle so I'll show you what is in the
mailbox last night it was the victor and
Ralph dinner at Harrods they're
launching some really beautiful
fragrances that are going to exclusive
terrace for six months and they gave us
these beautiful flowers in the goodie
bag so I need to put those in there bars
as well so pretty
first few hours since I last picked up
the camera
I've not moved really I'm still in the
kitchen the only room that's actually
liveable at the moment there's been lots
of screwing and soaring and squeaking
upstairs I have
have a look and we finally have carpets
in a fuse room looking a lot better the
builders had an argument
one of them has driven off and his skies
I was doing the bathroom so I don't know
if the bathroom is going to get finished
today either way I'm going to take you
guys around and show you what the
progress is looking like I've just been
across the road see at my child and
snacks
my favorite snack combination at the
moment Milky Way stars and skittles but
eating them both at the same time
seriously good and I just realized I
never really explained what happened to
yesterday's video because there was some
basically I was in town all day meetings
and I just never picked up the camera I
kind of forgot about every day mates I'm
really sorry and I know I also promised
David Gandy so what happened was David
Gandy is obviously the face of Dolce &amp;amp;
Gabbana fragrances and he has been for
10 years so I went to an event at the
doctoring designer store on New Bond
Street David was there and suddenly I
did not get to meet him because he was
doing interviews with a magazine
journalist at the time and I could only
say for ten minutes because I don't have
to go to the Viktor &amp;amp; Rolf dinner I'm
very sorry
to excite you about David Gandy but I
saw him from afar and he is just as
beautiful in real life although a little
older but don't we all
yeah then I went to Harry for the lovely
Viktor &amp;amp; Rolf dinner we discovered the
new fragrances which are absolutely
gorgeous and I actually filmed a few
Clips including a clip with Freddie who
I know you guys always say we look very
similar to each other and so I'm going
to play those clips now different guys
this is an example leaving a really bad
girl girl
- thanks ready yes we do know each other
haha are we ready - we're not release
the Train we're not really although we
do very meticulous
yeah although chef Lauren my favorite
singer - over I'm stepping out with
right Brian Grazer I do anything else I
like Bobby nice last note I don't know
it would be like it's three and I'm
tossing like a cemetery tonight I'm
looking at an arrangement okay like I
was like I'm going to do that in slow
motion little Ivan Allen about okay I'm
going to carry out the wealth work with
Lopez but have you can be anything I can
do for you
so yes that was last night
and back to today Friday I'm going to
give you guys an updated renovation
how-to
so it's much later on in the day now and
Charlie and I have spent the entire
afternoon what feels like about five or
six hours just clearing so much stuff
out so we've been taking a load of new
furniture out of the boxes we have been
taking some of our stuff out of boxes
and putting it back on the shelves
because the knowledge is pretty much
done so I showed you a little hyperlapse
the shelves where the TV is are pretty
much done we've just cleared so much
floor space Charlie's just ordering
burgers some delivery because we
absolutely deserve it how much you've
been doing today and only one
disappointment is that Blum excuse me we
opened up all of a bonus coffee table
and the marble top was just broken
straight and a half so we've got the
golden frame down here but I've treated
them and hopefully they're going to
reach out tomorrow and help me organize
and exchange the tops because it's so
beautiful I definitely don't want to
take it back I'm hoping they can just
send a new marble top and so we've
cleared the sofa and we're going to spin
er burger here but also charleen I just
went down to dawdle and there is so much
stuff so I know I promised you guys a
glog amount unboxing so I'm going to I'm
basically going to unbox until the
burgers arrive so I probably won't be
able to get through all of it but I
should be able to get through quite a
lot while we've been busy the carpets
are finally done
they look amazing they're a little bit
kind of pinky movie toned and yeah oh my
goodness let me show you this room so
when the builders were doing the carpets
we obviously had to just keep moving
stuff from room to room
so that they could you know do the
carpet so you can see tons of log mail
oh my goodness this is the inside of our
airing cupboard this is my desk on its
side my computer oh so I'm going to
attempt to clear a bit of a space I have
no idea where and show you some other
tips that we just bought from dawdles
okie-dokie so I've got the camera
propped up on a load of old boxes I'm
going to start with this bright yellow
envelope over here so this is about 10
days worth at blogger mail so let's see
what wonderful things we have to look at
today this is from L'Occitane okay so
this is open trouble minis are this can
be so I'm actually creating a video for
L'Occitane which you guys will see very
soon so this is all for that video and
it's all about that amazing travel mini
offering I have a lot of trouble minis
this is a mini show oil loads of mini
food small a mini oil makeup remover I'm
not going to go through all of it
because you guys are going to see it
very soon I'm going to pop that decide
if I need to take this with me to Monaco
where I'm going in a couple of days so
you'll see more Fest this next one I
think is from Garnier and it is so
beautiful they've got my name written in
what's the word calligraphy and then
these beautiful roses sticking out the
top of the box so I presume babe oh I
thought they'd have some water attached
to them oh my gosh they're dried roses
but I think they're real that is
absolutely beautiful so I would love to
know how you preserve roses like that
because I want them all over my house
inside oh my goodness this is such a
beautiful little delivery and you may
have seen I did an Instagram in
collaboration with Garnier a couple of
days ago and this is the full range
because they knew how much I loved it we
did like you to invite you to join
Garnier and championing the needs of
delicate thirsty skin by becoming a
member of our Rose floral water tribe I
like the sound of that
wow this is so cool okay first of all oh
my goodness organic tea totes
these are from the grace collection from
the seventh Duchess that looks amazing
you guys know how much I love my herbal
tea and then they've got this beautiful
mug with a jail net as an anthropology
one I actually
like this that is gorgeous I just love
anything from anthropology and then we
have the amazing collection I actually
already have one of these because I
bought one to do my photograph this is
the new guy named oyster either 96
percent natural ingredients and it
smells amazing it's so gorgeous on my
skin I used all the time I live in
America
also within the collection I also use
this the whole time in LA New York
dollars it'd be toning Rosewill so it's
a lot more gentle than other toners I've
tried so great if you're like traveling
your skin's a little bit more delicate
and sensitive and then this one I
haven't tried yet
it's the botanical cleansing milk with
rose water so I'm excited to give that
to try and complete my review of the
range this little box I think is the
memory stick very cute way of presenting
all the press information and then we've
got Lisa angel I don't know watch this
in here that summer look
so I think it's a very slow oh my
goodness that is so pretty that's a
little personalized necklace it's those
Josie on it from a brand called Lisa
angel this is gorgeous oh my goodness
I'm spoiled spoiled spoiled mmm next
covered in a bit of them rose petal
potpourri is a flannel with a J on it
which is just absolutely gorgeous I get
through so many flannels from my
cleansing that's incredibly handy in
fact I don't have a clean one for
tonight so that's perfect
finally a little t-shirt what does this
say it says wake up and smell the roses
that is so adorable
ah very generous absolutely love these
kind of goodie bags like it so much to
receive products but when brands put so
much time and effort into the extra
pieces I'm just so excited to have a cup
of rose tea in my new mug so thank you
Garnier if you're watching I am very
happy with my delivery very very
grateful so this one is from
foreo which they do toothbrushes and the
facial cleansing brushes I think this is
a toothbrush which are actually not try
to for a toothbrush before but I've
always found their facial cleansing
device
to be amazing this is actually quite a
tiny one which is pretty cool and
avoiding your way to brush your teeth
ISA play that's the name of what this is
sonic pulsations for effective cleaning
strong on plaque gentle on guns that's
intriguing I have yeah never tried
anything like this before other than
maybe like a tongue cleaner so I'll let
you know how I get along with that so
this next one is from da fan and let's
see what it says botanical powered peels
for professional results at home at home
home and aging pollution fatigue these
factors slow down the skin's natural
renewal process and exfoliation is
essential so this is a bespoke
affiliation for beautiful complexion
I just adore everything that I charge
and dolf am so excited to give that a go
tonight as well
aha so this one is from reward style who
I'm actually going to Monaco with on

an eye out for all my snaps from Monaco

ex goody oh my goodness I seem to have
like a lemon tree or a little tangerine
tree or something
I swear bloggers mail is so crazy these
days like never in my wildest dreams
when I first started rambling about what
I was doing at my mulberry internship
online but I ever think that it would
lead to me receiving gifts like this it
just blows my mind I'm so so grateful
this is just the most random blogger
mail I've ever got so yeah I think it's
a little little orange tree or a little
tangerine tree okay so this is from
Robinson's very clever see they're very
kind of these PRS 100% naturally sourced
ingredients for refreshing me
deliciously refreshing taste so as well
as the little bush I've also got oh my
god I'm trying to not let that fall over
three of the new drinks from Robinson so
we've got up link Kiwi
orange and lime and all the stands nice
raspberry and apple spring water with
real fruit that's amazing I hope they're
not sparkling I think they're still
actually don't like sparkling drinks hmm
that's so good
how is it healthy that is so tasty
simply real fruit no added sugar and
look the label is all green
yeah it's healthy not bad - bit of a
game changer for me because I get so
bored of water but I don't really like
any kind of fizzy drinks or anything
like that so this keeps me hydrated but
actually tastes good which it does that
is very exciting Thank You Robinson big

beautiful presentation box so this is a

been gold and white which matches the
beautiful new packaging from whether

your phone oh my goodness I'm so genius
Clinic you have smashed it so and this
contains liquid sphere technology
super charged water for thirsty skin
helps break the cycle of dryness and
environmental stressors that can lead to
premature aging so I guess you would
apply this before your moisturizer no
it's a supercharged concentrate several
pounds
I'll turn the 26th of May after your
three-step skincare systems this will be
the last thing you apply in your
skincare routine looks good excited to

food is here so I will continue with
this in about 20 minutes
Oh
okay let's carry on where we work for
that wonderful Barbie dinner finish that
envelope that's better the birth this
next one is from Bourjois so we have got
a little turquoise looks like a giant
playing card and then inside oh my
goodness brow palette with 16 hour wear
so they've got these new little palettes
and it's got three different shadows a
dark brown and medium brown and then a
pinky cream so this is a contour kit for
your eyebrows about the top of that and
then they cut that in two different
colors also volume reveal mascara
adjustable volume mascara that sounds
interesting
and then we've also got tons of
eyeliners so all of these things are
extra long we're call and contour and
you've got black a dark brown a grey the
only thing with the magnifying mirrors I
can't see the full effect so I don't
actually know if they're more volumizing
they were before but I do really like
that formula it seems to be nice and
kind of soft so it's not adding too much
clump which is great we're going to add
it on top of additional mascara and also
inside this package in bourgeois they've
put in this hoodie or this little jumper
which I try and put on now because
literally this is adorable so this says
all eyes on us and it's just cute little
winking designs I'm still wearing my
headband from earlier and now I've got a
jumper on so very lovely delivery from
Bourjois let's see what we've got next
I've got little envelopes over here not
sure who this is from
so this is another brow launch this time
from Rimmel brow this way fiber pencil
Oh
worldwide exclusive brow this weighs 5 a
pencil and a brow pencil enhance with
nylon fibers that is ridiculous
how on earth they've got tiny little
fibers within the brow pencil oh my
goodness so it's going to add
vol with the little fibers that mental
how do they put down a pencil I mean I
guess it's kind of a little bit of a
marketing ploy like it's not really
gonna add actual like long hairs it just
adds a little bit of volume with the
fibers but a really really good idea 499
available nationwide from may 2017
I've got light medium and dark I think I
might be a mix between light and medium
so it's nice to add it's nice use two
different shades and you really get a
bit more of a natural brow look so Thank
You Remmel oh my god I do not believe
what I've just read so this is from San
Tropez and apparently this is a self-tan
Express bronzing face sheet mask that is
mental how on earth would that work five
minutes for light time ten minutes for
medium tan 15 minutes for dark tan oh my
goodness
control yoga with our revolutionary
tanning infused facial sheet mask
hydrating tannins telling serum
nourishes while providing a reagent do
we go
so you just applied it's like a normal
sheet mask but it tells your skin and
they've also put in some cute little
hair bubbles as well which is really
lovely that is mental okay I'm going to
try this out tonight and I'm going to
try out my Instagram stories what I
think I'm going to do is edit this video
and upload it tomorrow morning so my
Instagram story will still be up so go
and check that out if you want to see
how I get along with this I'm so
intrigued that is so crazy
okay next few goodies so here we have a
multi masking set from the land glow
with four mix and match your favorite
marks for an instant sexy glowing skin
so inside here Oh more than four one two
three four five so you've got the
classic one and then five kind of shot
to add to it and then on the back you've
got some tips on whether you want a
jet-set glow a selfie glow and night out
go or and I have to do it overtake them
and after sex glow oh my goodness and it
showed you which different masks to
apply so that
really good fun great for traveling as
well having a little mini sizes also a
really nice way of introducing the staff
to the brand if maybe you've not tried
the market before they are absolutely
incredible whenever I use a clown wear
mask I really noticed a difference which
is what you want when you're planning
that kind of money on a face mask Lola
this next delivery is from Burberry
Beauty which is just rather incredible
and we've got a lip contour color I
think I've seen these online and I've
been dying to try them so very very
lucky to have been sent one of these
let's see how to get out okay so you've
got this beautiful kind of pewter
colored applicator and oh my goodness
look at that so it's a rollup shade I
really want to try this now whereas the
mirror oh my goodness I'm so desperate
to try these okay this one here is the
shade very limited fair Oh once it looks
like this is the lightest one but that
is absolutely gorgeous it seems like one
two and three or a simmer and then this
last one is pretty dark I think I'll
probably get the most use out of one two
and three but they are all absolutely
beautiful
AHA this next one is a very generous box
of goodies from elegant touch so elegant
touch comfort these new Express Mail
these ones
oh wow three minute mark you'll 24
pre-glued nails this is such a gorgeous
colors beautiful light pink and they
very kindly put in some more of my
favorites
so these if like me you love to have gel
manicures are such an essential I talk
about them all the time right into
transitory they're basically these
little rip open pouches you put your
finger in when it's got the gel nail
brush on leave it wrapped around your
finger for about 20 minutes and then it
takes off the gel that they are so good
I get so much use out of them and I love
that they're portable so I always take
because basically that is tiny tiny
little pouches I will show you you get
loads in a box it's absolutely crammed
full and then here is two of these
little sachets so I always take enough
to remove my finger and my toenail
polish while I travel the
I'm going away for two weeks my chip my
gel nails and I'm going to want to get
rid of all of it
so these are anything I love them so
much so handy so thank you elegant touch
sorry just had to change my camera
battery and I also spent and put on some
of the Burberry lipstick I put on number
three and I love it it's such a like
comfortable almost feels barmy but it's
not got any shine to what swear it's
definitely mat and I just love that it's
a scroll up so definitely a Homburg
favorite but I was just about to start
opening this when my battery ran out and
I can already tell what I think is going
to be inside it because it smells of
Estee Lauder bronze goddess which i
think is probably my favorite summer
fragrance I just love it so much and yes
okay so we have got and fresh maybe
they've released a lighter version and
then this is their little and shimmer
spray if your legs
I took my one of these two I had a
little pink one which has last year's
version to South Africa last year and I
used it all the time up so you loved it
so this is definitely going to be coming
with me on my upcoming travels and then
we have got what is this little item oh
look at that
so this is like a little highlight in a
really cute little metallic compact with
a turquoise little button and oh my
goodness that has got some serious
shimmer to it oh my goodness that is
beautiful in an even more ginormous
compact I love this design this is so
pretty
you've got wow I was not expecting that
you've got a big humungous blush and
then these up like two different
eyeshadows and then it's really vivid
turquoise emerald green in the middle so
really good for accentuating the eye
area and then I just love this packaging
so much this I think is going to
lipstick oh look at that color that is
the perfect summer holiday Coralie pinky
color and it does how that very faint
bronze goddess smell to it and then this
has got to be one my favorite products
whole world this is the bronze goddess
body lotion this is a whipped body creme
I don't have my old one was a whipped
one but ah this is so so nice whenever I
wear this I get so many compliments on
how I smell and people can't believe it
it's just a body lotion and not a
perfume I actually would go as far as to
say that this is stronger than the
perfume is so heavenly so thank you so
much Isildur these are just absolutely
beautiful and I love this fragrance so
much so this clutch is from Elizabeth
scarlet from the natural beauty
collection it's the jungle leaf rose
print from the spring 17 collection sips
in time as I needed to pack my travel
makeup bag sorry taking this one with me
on my upcoming adventures and then I
also just opened up this bundle from a
brand called dr. Brandt it came with
this really handy little mirror so you
open it up and then it also have a
little button on the top here which
illuminates this too so that's really
really handy once again great for
traveling and also an anti-aging skin
recharging magnet mark so parent units
will help reduce the signs of aging
maybe it like magnetizes the dirt out of
your skin that looks like a serious face
mask I've not tried this brown face
masks before so once again I'll give it
a try and keep you guys updated and then
I think the rest of my mail well there's
a lot of things for Charlie here but he
always got to the unboxing on his
