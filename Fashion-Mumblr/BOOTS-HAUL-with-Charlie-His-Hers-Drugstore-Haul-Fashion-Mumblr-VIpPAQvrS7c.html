video for fashion mumbler all week as
you can see I have Charlie with me hi
guys today's video and Charlie and I
just went to boots on Clapham High
Street and bought a load of stuff that
we've pretty much been meaning to buy
for quite a long time it's a bit of a
bit of a boot school so yeah I thought I
would ruin it charlie long and we're
both going to go through what clothes
for sport because Charlie buys as much
stuff as I do pretty much yeah don't you
for me if not more yeah and I know I may
not have that many guys watching this
but I do know that us girls do sometimes
buy for our boyfriends dads brothers etc
so hopefully you'll find it interesting
and entertaining having this one in the
video we will see you will see by the
way if you watched yesterday's video
with my Oxford Street haul this is the
top that I got bruised are so on yeah so
without further ado let's see what we
picked up from bits don't go fast yeah
sure ok I went for original source I
love the original source shower gels we
have a whole cupboard for this yeah my
mum always used to give us it was one of
the things she used to give but this one
is a scrub I haven't tried this one it's
a daily exfoliating scrub I've tried
from a similar one before which they
don't seem to make anymore
I feel like you've already talked about
this in a previous video and you're like
don't get it on your dangler but now I
probably wouldn't yeah I probably
wouldn't get on your sensitive areas but
this is a scrub it's really nice for off
the gym also during the summer obviously
it's quite nice to explain yeah but I
haven't tried this one I'm looking
forward to it
it's also vegan
first thing that I got is a really
practical one and it is a hair turban
from soap &amp;amp; Glory
I recently had to throw my ultimate away
because the button had fallen off I
probably had it for a couple of years
when you've got long hair like me hair
turbans are fairly essential way I do
look quite silly with it on but this
one's pink and I need a new one I think
these were on special offer as well
possibly even a hard price so picked up
a hair cover okay so I went went for a
moisturizer I haven't actually tried
this this Minori I'm an expert it's got
quite a long name hydrant energetic
recharging moisturizer turbo booster I
know how they make the names really like
yeah it's a really masculine I mean it's
to be honest why I thought was it'd be
quite a cool bottle for like the gym Mac
or for my travel is it fifty minutes
well that's quite a big bottle that'd
probably be good for Charlie
they also say on the back work on it so
it's good for hack when you've got
hungover skin so that tired skin
yes today but it is use quite everything
isn't it taurine and vitamin C so like
Torian is obviously Tory is in Red Bull
confusing so funny how they market these
things differently for men and women it
looks like something like I know
obviously Lewis Hamilton yeah is it
ambassador isn't it but how she looks
like anyway so looking forward to drying
up my first beauty thing that I picked
up was a face mask in this is from
Garnier skin active which i think is
like a whole range that they've got and
this is their moisture balm at tissue
mask so I think this is a sheet mask and
they just called it tissue masks just to
be different looks like it's got
pomegranates in it oh yeah there's a
picture of a sheep mouse down there I
became obsessed with sheet masks when I
went to Hong Kong I picked up so many
and they were really really cheap and
then when I got back to UK they were all
like three four pounds each and I felt
really ripped off this was 99p I think
it might have been on special offer down
from one pound of something but it says
intensive e hydrates the skin reduces
the look of fine lines and revives
radiance
on those days when sometimes the Kampala
to put on a proper like your race
masters then you have to wash your face
where's this I can stick it okay put it
on your bed yeah yeah I'll have to get
out of that again so for 99p I thought I
would give this one a shot yeah yeah I
like I really liked the estee lauder one
wasn't when you look at they're like a
Trojan War you know 18 pounds oh yeah
yes they'll order ones which I mean
obviously it says one mask equals equals
one week of hydrating serum I reckon
maybe that just means they've poured
that much serum onto it so it's like an
intense enhance hands but yeah looking
forward giving us a go if you want to
see how we get on with these things just
keep in mind with class snapchats or do
use a shower Instagram stories how Marie
decided by using cigar used by different
stuff on ending that's the features more
else not sure yeah someone snapped
through the other day asking me to
feature that's Dexter really right as
you can tell I have got a minor thing
over um so actually this is probably
something I needs takes daddy these are
from the brand called Swiss who I've
only actually recently heard of yeah
through one right through one of my
friends but also there are speaks points
of Team GB
obviously in the Olympics so they are
the men's bitumen sponsor because every
man needs a sponsor but they say they
sound obviously there's a lots of
printing brands out there these sound
pretty good in terms of you know once
again it's all around vegan but also
like high quality you know like
botanical extracts so they just sound a
little bit more upmarket
so why could I not take these
well I think typically there's stuff
like more zinc and stuff I mean I don't
know there's different vitamins that you
need and I need so the female version
that probably the difference probably
isn't a lot but it's just one just
multivitamins I think every it's your
honest side every way we're eating a lot
healthier aren't we
they still worth just topping up yeah
yes I hopefully I won't you fight off
any cold I then picked up three things
from number seven I haven't actually
bought number seven in quite a while
just because well if I'm completely
honest being a blogger I get sent quite
a lot cleanses and things to try out so
I haven't really needed Briony in a
while with and what a nice little beads
on special offer three for two and I
decided to pick some up I always always
always used to use the number seven I
makeup remover it used to be blue on top
and right on the bottom or clear on the
bottom the oil-based I'm Anubha cleanser
that used to shake it and still to this
day I retain it that is the best eye
makeup remover I've ever tried this is
the oil free version which is really
good if you have full slashes on all our
individual Nouveau lashes because oil
will make them come off but either way I
hope this will be just as good as the
one used to use and then I picked up two
different cleansers this one is a
foaming cleanser and this one is a
micellar cleansing water both of which I
just love both of these consistencies
foaming cleansers are really good for
cleansing brushes your put the cross on
yeah yeah where's my little water I use
as my first things everyday it's um
Sonia you don't need to wash it off
basically so you pump it onto a cotton
pad and my solar particles attract the
dirt from your skin okay yeah this is
not a lot of products not my Center is
the product I know okay most ever water
yes my so what is a really big things
easy and you know immediately I don't
know but you use it as your first time
to get rid of the bulk of the makeup and
then you clean your skin afterwards
right okay which is a step that most
people don't
I wouldn't mean this because I don't
wear makeup basically no but you could
use it to clean the oil from your skin
yeah why do no men sprang to my sword
well I think it's known as sex probably
isn't it yeah why don't they beckon me
for Father's Day
well yeah that was his brand wasn't it
like he was number so obviously our
accountant about all the great United
players oh yeah so only pick this up I
used to wear looks a lot it's links nice
dataframe it's a signature right I was
drawn to it because it says food would
and don't know the packaging is very
high-end yeah so Lincoln obviously is a
Browning Oh My yes I used to use links
at school thanks Africa yeah well I
blend that with voodoo it was like yeah
I made links chocolate is good as well
but yeah but yeah but I don't use them
anymore to be honest but this is more
bodies but I think it's a precision pump
spray so I actually just do a quick -
you know see that's quite sexy design
like to be honest this is actually more
of like a body fragrance
yeah interesting probably it once again
one for the gym bag will be quite my
size that is a very actually is it
hundred milk so you can take this on a
flight as one oh yeah I think that
pressure yeah anyway but ya know so
interesting one for links they're
obviously going into different markets
but now rather than just yeah the next
thing that I've picked up are these poor
strips from B or
I think that's how you pronounce it all
right final round and I have a French
friend probably and I haven't used poor
strips in so so so long but I was
actually watching one of Flers videos
and she picked up something similar I
actually tried to look for the ones that
she mentioned but Katherine boots is
fairly small so I've got these ones and
they are charcoal strips which are meant
fuel nodes for I have more blackheads on
my chin so I'm just going to try
sticking them on my chin yeah it just
says unclogs pores and draws out excess
oil for the deepest clean and heels off
yeah I thought those being they're gonna
be like really sad it's the most
satisfying thing yeah so it says it
draws out deep down dirt and oil that
can cause blackheads so hopefully it's
gonna pull out the actual black end
because that would be the satisfying but
who knows
yeah once again first impressions we can
be under go beyond our snapchats
tonight probably so yeah keep a lookout
for that okay
well actually yes are these so oh gee X
is a brand that Josie and I have been
using for a while
these are shampoo and conditioner
there's small bottles so I was drawn to
the fact they're quite small bottles I'm
not keeping into a match in back but
just generally like for your wash bag
yeah and also we travel quite a lot so
these like a moisturizer in conditioner
this is probably enough for at least two
week holiday partly yeah and I use this
as well so it's a really good one if
you're going online together then it's
this one is coconut okay doing this this
is this is the coconut one I just love
coconut yeah it smells good yeah so just
just a nice nice I actually picked up
another cleanser as if I needed any more
but this one I just wanted to try
because it's new it's from a brand that
I love it's from simple and it's their
cleansing oil and I don't know they'd
released a cleansing oil which amazes me
I feel like I love simple so I'm amazed
I didn't know that but yeah I love
cleansing oils so I thought I'd give
that one a go so here it is
should I try this one I use everyday so
these are exfoliating gloves from soap &amp;amp;
Glory
I actually I don't know whether I
probably someone's going to tell me off
but I actually use them everyday so
after the gym yeah you maybe shouldn't
over explain they're not too rough I
think you should exfoliate with a coarse
grain every year I think regular
exfoliation yeah and what's nice about
these is just with a normal so like with
the source but maybe just a normal
shower gel I really use it with there's
no because then you lose the benefit of
the particles in this yeah I know I'm
saying I'd use it with a normal shower
gel yeah so then you get the exfoliation
I don't know if there are guys watching
this or girls as well if you get that
little light bumps on the back of your
arms yeah that is massively helps yeah
they're just soap &amp;amp; Glory ones I
recommend that you should Charlie chose
the pink ones to that but I actually
have no say in this
what to be like look I mean to be honest
I would obviously prefer more magic
color
however the the white ones go dirty
quite quickly yeah I mean I know this is
booths or I should probably say this but
boots own ones aren't very good they
don't last very long
where is not sponsored you know I don't
like but there's so much about you and I
think a little bit more expensive but
they we probably we probably buy a pair
of you mind maybe yeah yeah you should
replace them quite regularly yeah that's
nice but okay so my next one is a
brownie a yeah it's not exfoliated I've
Garnier micellar
another one for you oil infused
cleansing water I saw quite a lot of
instagrams I think they did quite a lot
of bloggers activity with this recently
but yeah it maybe you want to try it so
well don't go near your vlogger
campaign works I went out bought this as
a result of that so yeah this is the oil
infused cleansing water use yeah you can
see the oil has settled at the top if
you ever see anything it's separated it
means that there is oil in there which
always
he is larger particles so the oil
twister top so just give it a shake
before you use it and yeah I'm really
excited to try this I think Garnier
micellar water is always my favorite
brand it's just big you get so much use
out of it and my skin loves oil it's I
have got way the skin but it really
likes when I put away your product on it
whether that is an actual oil or
something with a will in I'm rambling
but yeah I'm really excited to give this
destroy these so actually picked up a
couple more products from Gloria I'm an
expert range
I use this every probably every day once
again probably after the gym you have
about four variations of that in the
shower
know that this is the one this anti
blackhead one it's it's not too coarse
so exfoliate abate it's not a property
yeah I find it he's honestly it feels
like it really cleans our skin if you've
been in the gym where you have rugby
training or if you've just been
exercising it gives you that clean
feeling and this is probably one of my
favorite products it's quite hard to
find a deodorant that you like the smell
of right and that works because a lot of
the other brands I won't mention them
that make them they don't smell very
manly but they really do the job this
one reminds me of Abercrombie smell
really yeah yeah yeah another one no
fish
anyway Bali just said our mind texture
yeah but the other the other good thing
about this is one thing I don't know why
do you still do it today
he's those horrible white marks that you
get when you put a shirt or a t-shirt on
this is auntie max I never get so only
like a blue t-shirt I might put that on
yeah I like on other brands you get like
white noise and you have to spend all
this time doing this and it's it's a
proper workout so no this is this is a
product years now probably every day for
the last my next one is quite a
practical one I actually got this
because I saw your sister at the Greece
last time it's a it's a big flat mirror
and these are so handy for traveling
sometimes when you're traveling that you
just don't know if at hotels gonna have
a window or a mirror by the window and
it makes doing a makeup not suit
nightmare so if you have something like
this and the lid actually folds back to
prop the mirror up you can do your
makeup right quite nice for now yeah
exactly so you get the best lighting and
it's just a really big mirror that's
very easy to pack so pretty really handy
for traveling at the moment I use my
Paul and Joe one which is round but it
doesn't pop up so when I saw this I
think it was very expensive as I think
this is five pounds but I know I'm gonna
get a lot of use out of this so that's a
yeah purchase so so this product I feel
like I've talked about every video
Parma's farmers cocoa butter it is
probably one of my favorite products I
use it twice a day I think if you want
more but one good thing that I noticed
with this is obviously it's good at
moisturizing I'm so it's very good
during the summer but the other big
thing is it does help with marks so like
this like my god I'm quite clumsy so I
burn my arm I feel like I get rug
because I actually used the firming
version of this now I wrote a blog post
on why I love the firming version so
much I'll leave that link down below and
I guess me
he's probably like one step too far when
it comes to yeah and they do want
returning in donate which is amazing I
also wrote about that on my blog they've
got like a spray-on tan yeah both I love
comments and this is to be honest I
would always go for the one with the
just a squeezy top the pump I don't find
that much my you know and there's a lot
left in the bottom yeah which you can't
get to where the other side down yeah
exactly so so this and actually there is
a man's one said it in all the Buddhist
it's it's a different color bottom it's
a great read or anything for men and it
smells so different but to be honest I
prefer this way and then I have three
receipt I have three more bits and
pieces why don't you talk about this one
I'll talk about these two so another
random practical purchase boots
they're called the blonde blending hair
grips very obvious whereas me what I
like to do is when I have a ponytail I
wrap a strand of hair from the bottom of
the ponytail like that's come out of the
ponytail I wrap that around the hair
bubble and then gripped it in place with
this I just think it's really nice
hairstyle actually Nathan took a really
cute photo of me and Dexter and you can
see what I've done so I'll insert that
over tribes face right now
so yeah I always lose these I always
have my handbags like earrings those new
little hair things plastic you like
whiny OH
see I got those and then the last thing
that I picked up is a Rimmel lipstick
this is from the Kate Moss collection
and it's
pink kind of almost rose gold but more
to the metallic pink I love Rimmel as a
whole I love everything that they come
out with but I've never tried these
lipsticks before yeah I just thought
they were really beautiful and I wanted
to get the formula go so I picked up
number 54 which is rock-and-roll nude
and it just seems like a really lovely
wearable everyday lipstick so I'm gonna
give that a try as soon as we finish
going okay and the last product is one
I've not ever tried before and I just
was drawn to my sanctuary spa and it's
in radians exfoliator sounds you just
sounds really nice
I mean I love I love Sankey body scrub
smells amazing right soon as we should
have bought one of them they're really
nice but yeah I think it's it's just for
healthy-looking skin it's just an
exfoliator so I mean from a guy's
perspective it would probably be good to
use this before shaving yeah yeah yeah
no waste my sanctuary things they're
interesting to know how much it is but
yeah so they use apricot granules and
there's no microbeads in S which is good
yeah grape seed pumpkin testing like
that I'm tick you know what we should
actually do a video and we try and make
our own skin because thumbs up if you
