Charlie and I are in Boston and it's
both of our first time here we arrived
last nights we flew in quite late last
night went straight to bed because we're
not very hardcore and today is our first
day of exploring so ever since my idol
became Elle Woods maliki blonde
I haven't printed it to visit Harvard
University and that's where we are right
now so we're gonna have a little walk
around take some snaps maybe listening
on a few of these student tour guides
that are going on so I'm gonna show you
around Austin what we get up to the next
few days and of course what I wearing so
have a look around
this morning and we are alone
you taking the cookies
afraid
Oh James
I say
what you say
we've decided that because it is so
beautiful here we're definitely gonna
come back and shoot some more photos
another day possibly Monday today there
is a boat race going on which is kind of
the equivalent to Austin versus
Cambridge at the Henry regatta so it's
quite busy here today but we're gonna
head now to a shopping center I think
it's called the Cambridge Cambridge
that's the one I need to be line at fall
Club Monaco of course and I think
Charlie's gonna have a little look in
there as well so that's where we're
heading next the outfit that I chose for
exploring Harvard today I was kind of
trying to channel Elle Woods a little
bit took some photos wearing my very
intelligent spectacles earlier I decided
to go for my brand I take black boots
which are basically the most perfect
autumn accessory keep your legs slightly
warm but they're also a nice statement
part of the outfit and then I'm wearing
my jumper dress you might recognize this
one because I also have it in pink and
my Gucci bag which I got out of storage
spring on this trip with me love it so
so much I also have this beautiful
Mickey brownie photo scarf which is
accessorized and then Topshop sunglasses
which surprisingly I have actually
needed today 24 degrees
made it to Club Monaco and as if there's
always going to be dangerous that enough
already
they have 25% off when you spend over
$150 so I'm gonna try on this beautiful
selection not really going to out there
when it comes to my color palette but
everything is so beautiful
lots of Kashmir's lots of pinks lots of
bows and frills
few hours later now and Charlie now has
spent the past couple of hours
just in our bedroom working glamorous
life of a blogger
we spent the morning walking around
Harvard and the kind of Cambridge area
and then as you saw we went into a
shopping center and I did buy quite a
lot from Club Monaco so perhaps I'll do
a what I bought in America type video
when we get back to the UK so this
evening at Charlie and I and it starts
today today we are going to go and have
a burger oh so in the UK when we're at
home we normally go out for burgers on
Friday nights it's our tradition huh
honest burger Oh Charlie always orders a
special I always order at the honest
burger anyway so we're gonna obviously
last night we were flying so we're
getting our weekly burger fix tonight
I've done lots of research on the best
burgers in Boston and conveniently
number three on the list that I thought
to look the most reliable is a 12-minute
walk away from where we're staying so
we're gonna go for a little walk and get
our burger fixed this evening I will
show you my outfit of the day hopefully
the darling will film a few clips me in
the hotel lobby but I'm wearing a sari
all the mess in the background I'm
wearing a top that I bought earlier from
Banana Republic I just when I buy new
things I have to wear them straight away
who else is like that I can't just be me
I picked this one up I really liked the
sleeve detail I'm just still totally
obsessed with ruffles I've got the same
jewelry on that I had earlier and this
is my accessorized necklace
most of my bracelets are Monica vinegar
and then these are my estrogen mu
earrings from their orbit collection
which I love
and then my skirt is this it's almost
like a black gray metallic number this
is a midi skirt it's from brand attic
and just midi skirts and kind of
knitwear is such a dream combination for
me at the moment you feel really dressed
up but still nice and warm so this is a
lovely combination shoe wise I will show
you something better clips of them in a
bit but these are really really good
dupes of these Stuart Weitzman shoes
which I have in pink but obviously I
love them and I would happily buy them
in another color
if money were no object but it is so
these are dupes also from brand attic
and they're very very similar to twice
and ones but I just absolutely love them
so to accessorize I couldn't really be
bothered to change my handbags I'm
taking my Gucci again and then I'm also
taking this feather juillet that I
bought in Club Monaco earlier as well
because it's not actually that cold out
but I just wanted something snuggly to
keep my body a bit warmer so let's get
going
so I decided to change my handbag
because my Gucci Bags chain was pulling
on the feathers so yeah no problems so
I've gone for my accessorized bag
instead
good morning it's Sunday morning and
Charlie and I woke up bright and early
we were not even six o'clock this
morning and so many oh look Charlie's is
taking an Instagram story of a squirrel
we do have girls in the UK and they're
doing so today we are exploring actual
kind of Maine Boston area we are walking
through the park now or Boston Common
and we're heading to the old town area
and we're going it - yeah we're gonna
find some quirky quest on for brekkie
it's called the area is the old town
having to Charles Street and then I
think there's like Cambridge Street
Beacon Street or Beacon Hill Street and
that is what we're going to explore this
morning
we just stopped off for a quick coffee
and early breakfast and then we decided
to take a little stroll around the side
streets we came across a street called a
corn street and apparently there are few
people milling around and apparently
it's the most Instagram Street in Boston
so naturally we took a few photos there
although very lethal have a look at
these cobblestones
my boots awesome trainers and we've gone
for a little stroll we've been walking
for about half an hour and we've made
our way to the other side of Boston
Common we're doing a little bit of
shopping now I think the street we are
on is called Newbury Street Charley's
has picked up some new bits and bobs
from Kiehl's there's quite a lot of nice
stores down this street there was some
designer stores down there like Chanel
Burberry Valentino and now it's more
kind of like premium stores I have just
spotted a Kate Spade so that is where we
are going
where will I choose walking down the
shore dive in headfirst down to the
ocean floor
jacquard brown eyes preferred final
slice
get it any higher things we have to do
good evening it's a few hours later now
Charlie and I once again so he was
yesterday after exhausting ourselves
wandering around and exploring and
shopping etc etc decided to come back to
the hotel room at about 4 o'clock we got
a load of work done and just chilled out
for a little bit I also had a bit of a
pamper session my skin just felt really
gross and in need of some face masks so
we had a really chilled out afternoon
that's what Sunday's are for and now
we're heading out to dinner I found a
restaurant on Rosie Londoners blog post
about Boston I swear things like
TripAdvisor are just non-void these days
I only ever check blogs when it comes to
recommendations let me know if you are
the same and she recommended or she
photographed a place called grotto and
especially recommended the pumpkin
risotto which is exactly what I'm
craving and so that's what we're going
tonight just a 15 minute walk from where
we are staying outfit of the evening
once again I'm wearing something that I
bought yesterday this Club Monaco jumper
really liked the sleeve date detail
you've got this like bow detail you saw
me trying it on in the store yesterday
quite a thick knit as well so I haven't
actually got a firm level underneath and
then I am wearing my Topshop faux
leather effect leggings these are the
most comfortable things in the entire
world that's so stretchy lots of room
for expanding after my risotto and then
these shoes are pretty much exact same
color which is perfect
they are my burgundy stiletto heels from
Reese and I love them so much I will
probably take my Gucci bag it's got the
burgundy which just pulls everything all
together and then I may actually also
wear a cape because the temperature has
gone down a little bit this is the Cape
that I wore to fly in if you saw my last
week's outfit Diaries so yeah that is
the look of the evening
you better turn up you better be there
when I shake
watch me rock and if I can stuff
Sasha soldiers good morning it is Monday
and this is gonna be the last day of
this outfit diaries video because we're
going to Vermont tomorrow and I'm gonna
film something completely different
there and we have made our way back to
Harvard University Charlie and I
basically wanted to come and take some
really nice pictures here so I've got my
cutest outfit on this is one that I wore
for dinner a couple of nights ago my new
Banana Republic top my new fluffy Club
Monaco juillet and then I've got a
change of clothes in here this my
accessorized bag around ethics skirts
and brand ethics so going to shoot this
outfit and then we've actually rented a
cart I'm going to be driving it to Salem
later which should be really cool at
this time of year close to Halloween
obviously it is the home of the infamous
Salem witch trials so that should be
pretty cool I think Charlie's look as
good not gonna lie but yeah one last
look around Harvard and then it's time
to hit the road
you gotta go
so it's a few hours later and China I
have come to Salem which is about a
45-minute drive out of Boston it's quite
touristy here the whole town it's just
like a fact of course with the witches
every pub every cafe it's mostly night
lots of stores selling really catty yeah
which you're a teacher at which t-shirt
or which hat this is the place to
colleges parkland Amity why do we are
see any reasons visit we're approaching
a gargoyle playing the saxophone we've
seen stools filled like insect jewelry
there's no see people doing like psychic
readings to be fair which tour would
have been fun oh yeah and this is
definitely the
back in the car again on our way back to
Boston not sure we'd recommend a day
trip to say that it wasn't the most
exciting place very very touristy as I
said I would say if you were here for a
week yeah come if you were here three or
four days which I would recommend no I
think if you are definitely gonna spend
the time to do like a few of the witch's
tools and go to the witch Museum then it
would be pretty interesting we didn't
because we just came here on a whim and
I think you have to book these things in
advance no particular grammar theorem
worthy but we did take a stroll up
Chestnut Street and went past I think
it's called like the Roper Memorial
Museum which was quite pretty
another thing is that buildings that are
300 years old
to Americans are very historical but
it's being from the UK where 300 years
old
is really not that old at all I think
that we just don't get as impressed by
that I'm not sure if that's the mean
thing to say I think that is actually
very true yeah why if you're American
you come to the UK you're we take you
for granted
yeah actually like Georgian houses
Victorian houses for us is that
everywhere every which we take for cons
whereas a 300 year old house here is
like whoa stop the breath yeah but I am
glad that we came it's nice to say that
we've been to Salem and at this time of
year as well just before Halloween I
feel like we've seen it at its peak
there was a nice little kind of fun fair
area on a common Charlie had a
deep-fried Snickers bar yeah how are you
feeling about all those calories it was
quite a small one though yeah true I
felt last honours yeah I in hindsight I
probably wouldn't get it again what a
plonker to miss from me so we are
driving back to Boston and I will catch
up with you guys again a one final
outfit before dinner so it is our final
evening here in Boston we got back from
Salem about
our ago and once again we just been
doing a little bit of work catching up
so this is my final outfit for our time
in Boston I'm running this lovely floral
dress with flute sleeves which I am
obsessed with I just topped up my
lipstick that I've been wearing all day
today and I'm pretty sure I would get a
few questions on it so it is the YSL
tattoos lipstick that I featured in my
testing expensive or testing luxury
makeup video so I'll leave that linked
up on the screen in case you missed that
and yeah that's the look of the evening
Charlie and I are off to a Little Italy
in Boston tonight for pizza we're going
to your place that it's one of your
followers recommend to it didn't they

pink jacket which I've just been
obsessed with ever since I got it's just
