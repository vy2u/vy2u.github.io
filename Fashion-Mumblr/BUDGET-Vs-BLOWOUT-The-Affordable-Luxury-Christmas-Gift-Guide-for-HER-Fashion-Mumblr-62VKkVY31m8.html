me for my Christmas gift guide for her
the affordable luxury Edition so I
wanted to do something a little bit
different to the many fabulous Christmas
gift guys that are already out there
apology start noise in the background by
the way down here Dexter in Dickens have
decided now is a good time to have a
little battle there have you monkeys so
the gift guide today is going to be a
few of my favorite luxury products and
also some affordable alternatives not
necessarily dupes and I've not really
forced it for every single option but
for a few options where the main present
is a little bit more pricey I've also
given an affordable alternative which is
just as fabulous so without further ado
let's get started
so over the past few months you may have
noticed me becoming rather in love with
a certain handbag brand and that is
aspinall I think they make fabulous
gifts because they are more affordable
than the vast majority of designer
luxury handbags out there this is the
one that I am currently the most
obsessed with is called the Dockery bag
and this one retails for under a
thousand pounds so as far as designer
bags go that's not totally crazy
obviously still a very luxurious
Christmas gift but if you want to be
very very generous to the person that
you're gifting or if you're looking for
something super luxurious to add to your
own Christmas wishlist then this is such
a beautiful bag I have worn this so much
over the past few weeks and months which
you'll know if you've been watching my
vlogs or following my Instagram I find
it to be the perfect handbag size I
think it looks super luxe and it fits a
lot of stuff in there you've got these
two ginormous compartments as you can
see got loads of my little knickknacks
in there and then a crossbody strap as
well this comes in a few different
colors and they're actually launching a
folk-rock version very soon another one
that I think is beautiful is the one
that they've got which is ivory leather
and then a darker tan across the top
really really stunning and I think that
these would make a beautiful very very
generous at Christmas gift
if luxury leather goods are what's on
your Christmas wish list or if that's
the kind of vibe that you're looking to
treat someone to then this is my
fabulous affordable alternative this is
from a brand called Aurora and is
actually owned by one of my friends
Danielle she is a stylist and every
on this website is beautiful so so
stunning this is one of my favorite
pieces it could have many uses you could
use it for your makeup bag for your
makeup brushes for jewelry when you're
traveling is also quite flat so really
good for popping in your suitcase you
could use it for storing like your tech
stuff your wires anything it's just such
a practical bag it's also got a little
shoulder strap or wrist strap so that
you can carry it around as a handbag too
if you so desire inside its lined it's
got a zippe compartments and just it's
so beautiful this is a blush pink shade
and everything can be personalized as
well this has got jf embossed on it my
initials but the best thing about this
and I can't even believe it myself but
the price of this is only 30 pounds
which i think is absolutely spectacular
for something this beautiful and such a
lovely Christmas gift I honestly could
not recommend this brand enough I will
leave their website linked down below
everything that I mentioned this video
will be linked down the description box
but if you're looking for something
beautiful
along these lines for Christmas then
definitely definitely check out the
Aurora website something else it is a
very classic Christmas gift is jewelry
and a couple of my favorite brands have
just got the most beautiful pieces for
Christmas this year
firstly Monica vinegar this is actually
a gift that I've got for my friend for
her birthday but I will give you a
little sneak peek as to what's inside
but this is how Monica vinegar pieces
come wrapped up you get this gorgeous
bag and then inside the bag if you undo
the bow you then get this gorgeous
Monica vinegar box I keep mine and keep
all my jewelry on my dressing table in
it and then inside that you have this
little pouch inside like a little pass
the parcel once you get to the pouch
inside is your beautiful jewelry piece
as I'm sure you guys know I wear a lot
of Monica Vernon to jewelry it's one of
my favorite jewelry brands and one of my
favorite pieces is the signature bangle
this is the one that I'm giving to my
friend she's actually receiving it the
day that I'm filming this so I'm not
spoiling any surprises for her I wanted
to show you so the signature bangles are
this shape which is almost like a
handcuff you get you can get this very
delicate feminine skinny design or they
do do to other widths as well and also
in yellow gold and silver
as well as well as diamond-encrusted
ones there's so many options and then on
top of that you can get them
personalized this one has got a happy
birthday just engraved inside here so
you won't actually be able to see it
when she's wearing it but it's a really
nice personal touch to add to the
bracelet you can also get for example a
name or a message engraved along the top
there there's basically so many
different personalization options and
you can even do a handwritten message so
it'll be your handwriting that is
engraved on the jewelry so that I think
is a really really lovely gift and I
would definitely recommend a visit to
the Monica pin under stores so nice to
see everything laid out there and the
stores themselves are just absolutely
beautiful on the inside as well are you
finished
stop fighting ashes out traps your
little monk is a more affordable but
equally beautiful Christmas gift option
is from a sternum you another of my
favorite jewelry brands and a brand that
as well I wear all the time at my
earrings today I asked you to Moo and
this ring which I'm not sure if you can
see very clearly is also a stirred in me
I think they also make the most
beautiful Christmas gifts get the most
beautiful presentation that this is the
gift box that your piece will come in
and then here I have the come from the
name of this ring but this is basically
the ring that I wear all day every day
most of the time I think it's so
effective and what's great about it is
that you don't need to know the
recipients ring size because they're all
adjustable you just kind of put it out
or pinched in to make it bigger or
smaller which makes it such a wonderful
gift and most astrodome you pieces are
under the 50 pound mark as well so a
lovely option no matter your budget
for jewelry gifting this Christmas
something else which I think is a really
classic Christmas gift is a scarf and I
do have two options here as well the
first of which is the classic burberry
scarf with a Burberry check and this is
my personal one this got the heart
design on it which I actually received
from my mom at last Christmas and it was
such a beautiful very classic gift
option obviously Burberry scarves are a
luxury purchase they are the kind of
thing I think is totally worth it your
outfit instantly looks more fabulous and
more expensive when you add a designer
accessory like this but 350 pounds is a
lot of money and there are a lot of
affordable options we
equally as beautiful one of my favorites
is this one it's a giant super soft
super snuggly scarf from Club Monaco oh
now my tip for Club Monaco would be to
keep a look out for their winter sales
they often start before Christmas so you
might be able to pick something up
fairly last-minute before Christmas this
is a cashmere blend so it's super super
soft super snuggly but because it is a
little bit more luxurious and something
that you might pick up in say Topshop or
Zara it does make the most fabulous a
Christmas gift I'll leave links down
below to a few of my favorite Club
Monaco ones which are currently in stock
this when I picked up in Boston a couple
of weeks ago so hopefully it'll still be
online because the color combination of
the cream and the dusky pink is so so
beautiful next is a couple of watches
which I think would make fabulous
Christmas gifts no surprise the first
and I'm going to talk about is the
Michael Kors access SmartWatch I've been
wearing this for the past couple of
months could not rate it enough in fact
I've been going on about it so much that
I know a few of my friends are asking
their other halves or their parents for
this for Christmas and I absolutely love
it I think smartwatches have become a
really big thing this year and this is
such a perfect balance between having
all the tech that you need and also
looking absolutely amazing I don't
really want something that looks like a
huge bit of tech around my wrist but
this looks like a beautiful watch and it
does everything that I need SmartWatch
wise but not too much more it doesn't
have loads of fancy fangirl things I
wouldn't use it's just very practical
very very beautiful and would make an
amazing gift under the Christmas tree
this retails for around 350 pounds you
can actually get it on ASOS as well so
keep a lookout for their Boxing Day
sales if you don't find it under your
tree but I do have another affordable
alternative which is just as beautiful I
think a lot of people will have a Daniel
Wellington watch on their Christmas wish
list this year and this is how they come
presented so you don't even need to wrap
it up if you don't want to they come in
such a beautiful gift box with this
beautiful red ribbon around the outside
inside that you get a presentation box
and then inside the presentation box is
the main event the watch and then also
this is a Christmas gift set with a
beautiful bangle bracelet in there as
well I have gone for one of their
classic rose gold designs with a black
watch face really really timeless
elegant and feminine design this is a
lot more affordable than the
cause watch obviously SmartWatch isn't
for everyone and you really can't beat a
classic watch under the Christmas tree
Daniel Wellington do also have a couple
of offers on at their website at the
moment which makes it even more
affordable I think it's really lovely to
have like a his-and-hers watch design
and they have an offer at the moment
with a holiday gifts for everyone
campaign where if you buy two watches
then you get 10% off so perhaps you
might want to treat yourself and treat
your other half or if you've got a
couple of friends that you think would
really appreciate a beautiful watch like
this and that's a really nice way to
save a little extra money and they've
also given me an additional discount
code which is Josie 17 and that gives
you an additional 15% off so even after
the temp sent if you do end up buying
two watches you'll get another 15% off
or if you just buy one on its own then
every little helps to make it even more
affordable so this is the one that that
I think is absolutely beautiful
obviously Daniel Wellington have so many
designs we've seen them all over
Instagram and we all know and love their
beautiful classic designs this is one
that I've gone for and leave this one
linked down below in description box
along with all the other gift ideas so
next I've got a couple more Christmas
gifts for her that don't have affordable
dupes per se and I think it's kind of
obvious why my next one is a tin of
biscuit is biscuits now I think this is
a fabulous gift for the type of person
is very hard to buy for the girl or guy
that's got everything you can never say
no to having some festive biscuits and
biscuit ears literally you cannot beat
them they're so delicious and they look
absolutely stunning so you can choose
from a variety of beautiful festive tins
keepsake tins you can keep your spices
or whatever in them afterwards and then
inside the tins are the most beautiful
hand decorated biscuits so you have ever
seen inside mine here we have the
partridge in a pear tree I've got the
chicken I've got a pear in the next
layer I have got the gold ring the music
notes
so obviously this boxset is based around
the Christmas Carol twelve days of
Christmas each of these has been so
lovingly and delicately hand ice a
detail on these is absolutely beautiful
so you really are giving a beautiful
gift as well as a very delicious one so
I think that is so I think that is a
failsafe Christmas gift option I know
that I would be very excited to find
this underneath
my Christmas tree and something else
that you really can't go wrong with is a
very luxurious Christmas candle one of
my favorite brands is neon Charlie and
I'd love to have their Christmas candles
dotted around the house and this time of
year this is their Christmas Wish
scented candle and it is their three
wick edition if I take it out the box
you can see just how beautiful it is and
the smell of this without even lighting
it is absolutely beautiful you can only
imagine how fabulous the house will
smell and this is actually lit but
around the edges of this big candle you
have a gold design that looks so
stunning when the whole room is just
flickering with the Golden Plover candle
looks so so beautiful really festive but
also not so festive that you have to put
it away when January comes because
you're going to want to keep this in
your living room throughout the year
neon candles as a whole I totally rate
them they are filled with so many
beautiful essential oils that give it
that amazing fragrance but also they're
not polluting the air as you burn them
which is becoming increasingly important
to me we don't want to be breathing in
loads of horrible chemicals this one has
mandarin cinnamon and a few other
festive oil scents in there so it really
does give off the most incredible
fragrance I wish I could do let you
smell it but we're a few years away from
YouTube being able to do that my next
Christmas gift I actually have three
options and they are all cashmere based
products I think that cashmere such a
lovely thing to receive and such a very
generous thing to gift at this time of
year my first one is from white company
if you know someone who travels a lot
and this is a really really lovely
option for them it is a very travel
friendly pouch and then inside you get a
cashmere I mask I mean how the curious
is that for a long-haul flight and then
a cashmere blanket as well I think that
a cashmere blanket slash travel set is
the kind of luxury that you definitely
wouldn't spurge on for yourself but if
you do know someone that loves to travel
and you think that they would appreciate
a little bit of luxury as they go then
this is a really really beautiful option
the white company has so many fabulous
gifts this is the one that I chose and
on the I will certainly be getting a lot
of use out of but I do have two other
cashmere options as well something else
from the white company and you may have
spotted this on my Instagram and on my
recently is this beautiful half-length
cashmere Rosso this is the most
expensive of all the cashmere pieces it
is actually on sale though down from
around 232 I think just around 180 pound
price mark still very expensive but a
real beautiful luxury piece this is more
of a robe slash dressing-gown obviously
got the nice tie way so you've got nice
pockets so a lovely one for anyone that
likes to be in their comfort element at
home but then my affordable alternative
is this cashmere cardigan from next now
again I think this is a really lovely
piece for traveling I did have for many
years a reece cashmere cardigan in fact
I still do and I love wearing it when I
travel any long haul flights any long
car journeys because it does keep you
nice and snuggly warm but it's so soft
as well this retails for 100 pounds
obviously cashmere is not cheap but I
think this is very good value
considering the quality of this cashmere
the oatmeal color as well I think it's
been a failsafe
option suits a lot of different skin
tones and most people love this kind of
neutral hue and my last option of which
I have two different price points I have
chosen that some silk pajamas these are
my very own Olivia van Hull silk pajamas
I first discovered this brand when I was
so kindly gifted a white and black set
from Clarins at their Christmas dinner a
couple of years ago and it even had my
initials on so you can get these
personalized these are literally the
most luxurious pajamas you can get I
then treated myself to the pink or blush
sets I also have long trousers to go
with this but I only had time to iron
the top to show you but it really is the
pinnacle of luxury pajamas so a fabulous
gift a very very luxurious one they do
retail for over the 300 pound price mark
though which is quite frankly ludicrous
for pajamas but I do have another option
and this is a brand that again I
absolutely love it's called Lay's where
these are under the hundred pound price
mark but there's still beautiful top
quality silk pajamas I actually find
that these require less ironing than the
aliyev armhole ones it just depends on
the type of silk and they blend with
man-made fibers as well both have a very
similar style both feel so lovely and
luxurious they look very luxurious and
expensive because they are but the black
piping detail on both I think is so so
stunning so this comes with a
of silk shorts you can also get sets
that they have on their website at the
moment I do have one on my own Christmas
wish list that comes with the
full-length trousers the shorts and a
matching eye mask so definitely check
out the laser website as well and as I
said I do have a set on my personal
Christmas wish list too so those aren't
my top affordable luxury Christmas gifts
for her I really hope you enjoyed
looking through these with me and I hope
I've possibly given you a little bit of
inspiration I do also have a whole
series of blog post going live on
fashion tumblr comm with tons and tons
of gift ideas so if you're struggling
with what to buy someone maybe it's
someone who's into their interiors or a
pet lover or someone who's just bought a
new home boyfriend mom dad whatever I
have gift guides to cover everything and
they're all really easily shoppable too
so do check out the blog for lots more
info I will leave all the posted of bone
life so far linked down below and that
is all from me so thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next one
bye
