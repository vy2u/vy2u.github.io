going to be all about our journey to
getting my hopefully my dream walking
wardrobe I'm starting filming this the
day before it starts to get built
everything is being delivered and
building and starting tomorrow morning
and I'm so so excited but before the
madness kind of kicks off it's going to
take about two to three days to build I
wanted to show you what the room looks
like now and tell you a little bit about
the process that we've gone through so
far so ever since we moved into this
house we've been slowly but surely
upgrading each room over summer as you
may know we had a bit of a renovation
when it came to like painting carpets
are ensuite bedroom we totally ensuite
bathroom rather we totally redid and
we've painted at the kitchen and things
like that this room has always been just
kind of too small for a real bedroom
although when we did look around the
house when we're thinking about buying
it this was being used as a double
bedroom but there was like no other room
in here whatsoever I just had a wardrobe
a chest of drawers and a desk in there
and it always just felt a little bit you
know not like a real room I didn't
really have a purpose so we've always
wanted to turn it into a walking
wardrobe storage for Charlie nice big
issue with both fashion bloggers so we
have a lot of clothes a lot of shoes a
lot of accessories so we're working with
sharps to build our dream walking
wardrobe and yeah this is the process so
far so this is the room taking you in
beautiful bright sunny day stay I had to
obviously totally empty the room because
they're gonna be starting to build
tomorrow apart from the shelves a bit
behind the door is one that I haven't
done so far just got my little box which
is got some shoes in there and my shoe
shelves and I need to empty the room is
pretty bright don't mentions wise I mean
it's like the size of a double bed plus
half another double bed if that makes
sense I mean I flip the camera around
show you properly this is the room you
might recognize it from some of my old
vlogs used to have my desk with my
beauty things they're big white desks
that had my iMac on there we used to
have a radiator but because we are
building like an under
window seat we've had a builders take
that away this little corner is where my
wardrobe used to be and then behind the
door we've got these shelves we've also
moved the light switch from here to
outside because I didn't want to have to
like reach through the Wardrobe to turn
on the light so the Builder has come and
done all of those bits just also need to
take down these things too so yeah this
is the empty room builders coming at
7:00 a.m. tomorrow to start building my
dream wardrobe room I'm just really
really excited to hopefully share the
process with you guys so far we've had
two visits from sharp sharps people
first of all we had been come around and
he came and he took all the measurements
and he sat down stairs together we had a
really long discussion about what we
needed how much space we wanted just you
know he measured also all of the current
wardrobe space in the house so every
single wardrobe rail every single spare
clothing rails I don't know if you know
but in here we used to have two of these
one for me one for Charlie and then
we've had this wardrobe which is the one
that used to in the other room this is a
spare one and then we also have a little
wardrobe in our bedroom too so obviously
we don't want to have that many of
wardrobes and rails around the house so
been measured all of the rails to figure
out how much storage we currently have
so that we know that we're gonna have
more than that in at the new one we
spoke about shoe storage handbag storage
and the design whether I wanted it white
or gray or black or wood all of those
details right down to the handles and I
want them the drawers so many details
it's just so bespoke it's incredible and
then he sat down and sketched it all up
and we just did so many edits until it
was something that chai and I were
totally happy with then a couple of
weeks later we had another engineer come
around actually he was a surveyor and he
was looking at the room with more like a
builder point of view making sure that
everything that the designer had
designed was actually going to be
feasible which it was oh except I think
we decided that the fancy rack that you
can get for your shoes wouldn't be
feasible because of the lack of widths
that we have in that room but that's the
only thing that we had to tone down a
little bit so so far it's been a very
easy and
fun process and I'm just so excited to
see it all starting to come to life so I
will see you guys in the morning bright
and early to welcome the builders in and
start building the water room yay so
it's day two of the build and once again
I'm up super early I'm actually going
away for a couple of days on a work trip
so next time I come into this room it
should be done but at the moment
obviously I was also at the house all
day yesterday I came home and a lot of
progress has been made as you can see
behind me we now have the shelves in and
then the doors are on the wardrobe
sections behind me and they look so
lovely I'm just so thrilled with a color
choice especially it looks beautiful it
just keeps the room looking so big and
bright really really happy with it
and obviously it's dark outside now so
the lighting is not quite true because
it's big overhead lights in here at the
moment and then down here we also have
what is going to be my drool unit that's
where I'm going to keep all my knitwear
and folded t-shirts things like that and
I'm gonna flip the camera around and
show you that properly the drawer unit
is being used as the Workmen's bench at
the moment that's gonna have a really
lovely cushion on top these are the draw
handles that I chose they actually match
the handles we've got in the kitchen and
then the drawers are lovely soft shots
which i think is great this clamp I
don't know how to use it but that's what
we're using to get in to the doors at
the moment while there's no no handles
on those and then this is a shelving
unit so yes I'm going away for two days
now they are going to be continuing
working while I'm away so next time I
see you I'll be standing in my completed
walk-in wardrobe hello again so it is
three days later or two days later I've
been away for the past couple of days as
I said and I have returned home to a
completed walk-in wardrobe room
obviously I've already had a peek and
I'm very excited to show you guys so
without further ado not gonna build out
the tension let me show you my new
walk-in wardrobe
dum-dum here it is oh my goodness it's
quite hard to show you ball in one frame
but let me go in and oh my gosh I just
love it so much I explain it to you okay
so obviously it's quite hard for me to
show it all in one frame but I'm gonna
do the best that I can so this is the
room you saw at the very beginning it
was just totally empty first of all I'm
so pleased with how much space I have in
here this wall this floor area I thought
was gonna be about half this size so I'm
just absolutely all that it's you could
still actually fit if you really wanted
to like a pullout single bed in here I
could still have people to stay there's
definitely like almost two meters on the
floor here which i think is incredible
as you can see at the back and I think
this is just such a beautiful feature we
almost didn't put anything at the back
there and because we did have to take a
radiator out so we achieve it but I'm so
pleased we did we've put in six little
drawers and then on top of the drawers
we've got a cushioned area I'll show you
it a little bit more close-up detail so
this is the back area this is one of the
new fabrics that shops have gotten off
but you can obviously choose your fabric
choose a style I learned something quite
classic and chic so I went for this
cream almost gold color and then it's
got the little studs in there as well
which I think just such a lovely classic
effect and then underneath we've got the
drawers six drawers because I do have
quite a lot of stuff that needs folding
each one obviously empty at the moment
that's my task this afternoon is to fill
these all up and they do have a soft
closure which really amuses me because
I've never had anything soft close
before so Charlie and I have decided
that this side over here is going to be
his side because Charlie has a lot of
clothes as well his side as you can see
is mirrored if you look closely as well
so this is why it took a little bit
longer than it was originally going to
because we obviously didn't account for
the coving in the ceiling which is a
little bit silly of us so our carpenter
had to do that all individually but it
just fits absolutely beautifully nothing
from Ikea I could ever fit the
room as amazingly as this does so yeah
this is Charlie's side and we've
actually just put this on the floor for
now because we didn't realize that of
course and a candy cane if we open this
too quickly it'll knock into the mirror
so we're just gonna put a little stirred
at the bottom of the door
so yeah Charlie's side I'll show you I
don't think he's put anything in there
at the moment okay yeah he's already put
some shoes in so his first wardrobe area
and they all have these amazing lights
which just illuminates everything and
the carpenter has put the light on the
very edge as opposed to in the middle
because then it illuminates all of them
instead of just the top shelf so
Charlie's making the most of these
drawers by filling them with his shoes
he has more shoes than I do I don't
understand how he can possibly need so
many shoes but he does I think these are
soft clothes as well
yes look at that so smooth and then in
his middle section let's see this is
still empty I always got a couple of
pairs of shoes in there so we designed
all of these bits we could choose the
height we could choose whether we wanted
a rail or loads of shelves or even
drawers but for us we thought the best
use was this so he's got three more
shelves for his shoes or he could put
knitwear I guess it'll take us a little
while before we decide what works
perfectly everywhere this I think he's
going to use for his like everyday
clothing he can put scarves or belts or
ties on here looks like he's got some
more shoes up there and then some dust
bags love that you can just push them
this soft hose is really amusing me and
then this is also a very snazzy little
corner so obviously you can't get to
this bit but you can still access the
top section and it is a double height
wardrobe there we go the light just
flicks on in there as well once again
the light is in the middle section there
so it illuminates everything if I step
back you can see how this works so this
door here is full length but the second
door is almost like a stable door and
then inside he's got a double height or
a double hanging rail system I guess he
can put his jackets up there and his
trousers maybe however he wants to do it
and then we've we've got on both sides
these shelves so he can put his
luggage or whatever he wants up that
camera equipment anything at all and
then as you can see down there there's
actually a plug system that is making
the lights work in the top of the
Wardrobe but he could also put I don't
know we'll have a kind of thing you want
to plug in there I probably put my
blow-dryer or something down there
so that is Charlie's side we decided not
to get both sides marriage because he
thought it would be a bit of a weird
effect but we could have done that and
obviously the mirrors are full-length
you can't see everything in one go
because of the middle section but I
actually chose it to be like that I
thought it looked a lot nicer and then
you can see that the mirrors are I want
to say beveled or is it bezel
I think it's beveled which it just looks
so beautiful I'm just so thrilled with
the final effect and then my side is
very very similar to Charlie's I'm gonna
decide why I put in there I want it to
be really nice and visual maybe my
favorite handbag of the time at the
moment because I just got back from a
flower balm trip I've got a flower balm
box I've got my favorite perfumes loads
of different types of flower bond some
shoes and then these I actually very
kindly got for my birthday they are some
crystal-clear smelling salts so you're
feeling a bit stressed you can just have
a little sniff on those I thought I
would and I do get very stressed so I've
got those there for now but I will
probably really make this quite visual
and beautiful so we shall see how this
ends up I have got a double section here
but the door opens on one side and then
it goes like back because obviously it's
the area behind the shelves as well so
what I'm planning on doing since such a
long area is having my overni boots on
the floor here and then any long
garments any long dresses any long coats
they will go in there and then my
luggage fits like big holders and bigger
handbags will go there then we have my
big middle section if I open this up
temporarily that I am gonna organize
this properly now and so I've got three
drawers or shelves down at the bottom I
think I will use that for Footwear and
then on this middle section I'm probably
gonna put like jewelry boxes that kind
of thing my most used clothes and that's
action and then we've got another great
big space at the top which is so so
useful and then similarly to Charlie's
side I have got a full-length area here
and then a half height door too once
again I could probably put over knee
boots or anything taller down there I've
got the two rails so single height rails
big section at the top there and I also
get to use all of these drawers for my
folded clothes as well so as you can
probably tell I am beyond thrilled
the finish is just so luxurious it's
been so beautifully done that the
carpenter that worked here was so
skilled he's just there are there are no
details that aren't perfect and
perfectionist like me is just absolutely
blown me away the color I'm so pleased
with as well obvious off-white it says
gorgeous gray color almost like a dove
gray which I think is stunning and I've
gone for quite a traditional look with
this paneling detail and then I
obviously chose these brushed silver
twisted door handles as well everything
I think it looks so beautiful together
and with the cushion as well over these
drawers I'm just so so so pleased with
how everything looks so now I guess it's
time for the fun bit I get to fill it up
with all of my clothes the real next
door as you can imagine is a huge mess
not only because I've been super busy
over the next few days I'm tidying is
always quite little on my priority list
but we just struggled so much with
storage before this room so we just have
stuff everywhere so I'm so excited to
just organize it and for everything to
have its own place in our new walk and
wardrobe so I'm gonna put you guys down
somewhere put it on a little bit of a
time lapse and start filling up my water
okay so I just started putting the
clothes that I just kind of had lying
around in the other room into the
wardrobes as you just saw and I think
I've got myself a bit of a system so let
me show you what I'm trying to do in
this section which is the section
closest to the window I've got my kind
of shorter dresses so things like my as
our knit dress which comes to just above
my knees and then I've got my Club
Monaco dress those the only two dresses
I have downstairs I did put a lot of my
clothing in suitcases up and loft just
while we were getting this built so got
the dresses up in that section and then
if I open this up obviously still very
very empty I have got down here in this
little corner I'm putting my skirts it's
a really nice height for skirts this
little area so that's what we're going
for at the moment I probably don't have
enough skirts to fill that whole bottom
area but I'm sure it will get filled one
way or another then in the middle
section so I always kind of planned for
this to be my main section the section
that I use for most daily items so my
most worn pieces which of course is my
neutrals I just wear pink and beige if
you don't know and can't tell all the
time so we've got the things that I just
reached for on pretty much an everyday
basis this section will get very full of
no doubts I did also start to put down
here and well just one pair of boots at
the moment but this will be boots and
then some other shoes and then maybe
kind of flats and mules down there so
that is the middle section so far this
end section which curves round I'm
definitely going to be putting my coats
longer coats in that section at the back
there and then towards the easier to
access side I currently have just got a
few dresses so a mixture of long dresses
which jumper dress is slightly more
lightweight material dresses and down at
the bottom we've got a few of my urban
events it's a really good height in that
area for the new boots so I'm gonna
carry on filling out this wardrobe it
might take me the next couple of hours
probably the whole afternoon but it's
gonna be a fun time
and I'll catch up with you a little bit
later
okay so it's a couple of hours later now
on first inspection it doesn't look like
I've done that much but I have put it's
quite a lot more clothes into the
wardrobe the main thing that is filling
up a lot of space is my outerwear so
I've put my kind of half-height
outerwear in the stables door section I
find it really easy to access here as I
said earlier I'm sure as we live with
the wardrobes bits might move around
depending on what works out best for us
so for now I've got my coats up there
but who knows I think I'm going to film
a wardrobe tour when this is all
complete maybe in January and once I've
like lived in it for a little bit so
give this video a thumbs up if you would
like to see a wardrobe toy in a few
weeks time and let me know if that
something that you'd like to see down
there I currently have my spare hangers
there are so many things turned off that
need to be hung at so I've got lots of
spare hangers down there and then as
before my skirts got a few more in there
now nothing is taking out the top shelf
in that one just yet in this middle
section however we have got up at the
top
illuminated nicely some of my handbags
is the ones that I use most frequently
and so we've got some awesome Bromley's
and then my Kate Spade make cetera et
cetera
as I said the bits that I'm going to use
most of the time are going to go here
and then as you can see I filled out a
few more shoes down in that next section
the drawers are a really good width
apart so they fit in really really
nicely and then in here we have got
longer coats I've got my like woollen
thick winter coats and that are just a
little bit too long for the half-heart
shelving at the end there and then just
a few long dresses some jumper dresses
and as I said over knee boots down there
you guys are going to know off the top
of your head so everything is hidden in
my wardrobe and then the shelves these
are something that I know that I'm just
going to keep on building up over the
next few days and weeks as I said before
I've just got my perfume collection my
flower bombs
I put in a couple of my favorite
designer accessories that I really like
to keep on show my Valentino shoes and
my Chloe nail bracelet bag the rest of
it is still a TBC so I think I'm going
to end this vlog here because you've
seen it built you've seen a little bit
of a suggestion as to what I'm gonna put
where and Charlie obviously has to fill
out his side
I really hope you enjoyed looking
through this process with me I would
recommend sharps so much it's been an
amazing experience the whole design we
got to do completely from scratch and we
had so much input in everything it's
just absolute perfect for our needs and
I'm so pleased with the final result it
looks beautiful it's just so practical
and I can tell it's going to make so
much difference in our home when it
comes to storage and just having a
really elegant design in our house I'm
so happy
as I'm sure you can tell so thank you so
much to show ups the whole team everyone
that had an input in this has been
incredible I'll leave all the
information about them about the process
about the finishes that we've got all in
the description box down below and
they'll be a blog post coming in the
next week or so to keep a lookout for
that as well but yeah let me know in the
comments below if you'd like to see a
wardrobe tour in a few weeks time and
your wish is my command so thank you so
much for watching and I will see you
very soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
