having a good day today I decided to
film my bad skin day beauty routine
because today I just woke up with really
really bad skin for me I had blemishes
all over the side of my face they were
red I was oily it was pretty damn
disgusting but you know I thought I'm
gonna turn that negative into a positive
and show you guys how I create a makeup
look when I am suffering from a bad skin
day so for me about skin days can be
because it's that time of the month
or if I've been eating rubbish if I've
been traveling a lot if I have not been
drinking enough water and at the moment
it's probably all of the above so as you
will see in the makeup free shots I am
really suffering from a load of redness
around this area but when I am suffering
I do tend to switch around quite a few
products which I thought I would share
with you because it might be useful if
you do suffer as well from breakouts
like me when it comes to cleansing the
skin I don't actually change up my
cleansing routine that much because I
find that it's good to keep my skin in a
routine and prevent any kind of
fluctuations in oil production so I
don't actually change up my cleansing
and toning routine that much but I do
add in a couple more products I find
that origins has always been the brand
that I reach to and I really trust when
it comes to my skin so the first thing
that I add into my routine and I use
these after I have cleansed is the spot
remover blemish treatment pads and I've
had this tub for probably about eight
months and I only really reach for these
when I am having a bad skin day so
usually once or twice a month I will
just use a pad or two just to kind of
tow
and regulate out my skin and this has of
course got ingredients in it which
fights the blemishes which is great and
it really helps to start working on
improving your skin as well as treating
them and then another product from
origins which is even more targeted to
actually fight those blemishes get any
nastiness out of the skin and something
which I've relied on ever since I
started beauty blogging is this and it's
the origins super spot remover now this
is actually introduced to me by a friend
she had this little pot in her handbag
and I think I remember laughing at her
because it was just such a tiny little
pot but she was like no Josie you have
to try this at honestly it works in
miracles
and I've still had this pot from before
I started my blog make a little bit
unhygenic but it still works for me so
what I do is apply a little bit of the
gel onto my fingers and then from my
fingers directly onto the blemishes I
don't get it elsewhere on my face
firstly because there's only this much
in the pot and I don't want to waste it
but also it is very strong so if my
sorry to be gross if the spot is
actually open and it you can really feel
it it'll really sting and you can feel
it pulling out all the crap but I
personally love that feeling
brings tears to my eyes but I love
knowing that this product really works
at the moment my spots are kind of more
scars and just redness and probably more
under the surface so I didn't get that
stinging feeling by still go that really
tingly sensation which I love because
it's just now I know that it's working
so I applied this directly onto the
spots and then leave it for maybe half
an hour to let it kind of work its magic
before using either face wipe or a
micellar water to remove the almost film
I guess that leaves on the skin at night
however I won't remove the film I'll
just leave it and then stick my normal
moisturizer over the top as well as
adding these two into my skincare
routine I also like to give myself a bit
of a pamper and when I have got bad skin
one of the face masks that I reach for
on a really regular basis is this one
and it's the spotless skin blackhead
eliminating face scrub now it says face
scrub but I actually leave this
my skin as a mask before starting to
scrub it off so it's like an exfoliator
but because all of those ingredients are
so skin loving and I do feel them
pulling out the dirt from my skin when I
have it on so I leave this on for about
five minutes before I hop in the shower
to scrub it all off and again the
ingredients in this I think it's got tea
tree zinc PCA which absorbs excess oil
chamomile which of course is really
soothing for the skin and witch hazel
which we all know is really good for
tightening and cutting out those pores
so I find that this is a really good
addition to my skincare routine when I
am suffering from skin so now prepare
yourself because you're going to see my
makeup free face I'm going to show you
my beauty routine and makeup routine for
when I have bad skin days so beware and
enjoy so the first thing that I'm going
to apply to my clean face is this and
this is a new launch from Vichy and it's
their beautifying anti blemish care
24-hour hydration cream and I don't use
a moisturizer on days and my skin's not
particularly good because I find that
this is a bit of a multitasker it's kind
of but earned a bit of a primer but more
of a treatment and a moisturizer and one
so I just do kind of half a pump I find
that a full pump of this it's actually
too much but this does just sink into my
skin really quickly and I apply it all
over not just on the areas that I am
suffering from blemishes and this has
been formulated by Vichy to really
target adult acne an adult acne isn't
what you might think like your whole
face covered in really bad spots but
even just like I mentioned the area of
breakout that I've got that's still
classified as as adult acne and this
product really just helps to get any of
the nasties out of his skin and as well
as creating a really good base for
makeup so whenever I'm having a bad skin
day this is always what I reach for I've
been using this now for maybe three
weeks and since it launched you might
have seen I flocked the launch party at
the shangri-la
and it's part of an all modern rain
so also love the three-in-one cleanser
exfoliator and mask and the micellar
water so it's really good to just get
involved with that whole routine if you
do suffer from blemishes and because I
want my makeup to stay in place all day
long I don't want it sliding around and
revealing this horrible area of skin I'm
also going to use a primer and this is
actually a brand new one from collection
and it's there primed and ready
mattifying pore minimizer primer which
has ingredients by which in there so
which you probably know is a skincare
company that produces lots of products
for spots and bad skin days so it's
really good that it has that kind of
skin care element as well and I'm not
doing this all over just on those
certain areas that I tend to get a
little bit shiny on my t-zone on that
area of redness and then across my
forehead which is where I do tend to get
the shiniest so this instantly as you
can probably see has mattify the skin
and it will help keep my skin prepared
and ready for makeup and hopefully stop
the oil throughout the day on a normal
skin day I would apply foundation and
probably not put that much concealer on
at all but today because I have got so
much redness there I'm going to use my
amazing concealer and it's actually
called amazing concealer to firstly get
rid of the redness in this area now I
don't want to transfer any germs from my
fingers for my face to my fingers to the
tube so I'm going to start by just
putting the amount that I think I'm
gonna need on the back of my hand so I
don't have to keep touching the nib of
this cuz I could probably get a little
bit on how to you neck and then I'm
gonna use my finger to just start
patting it onto those areas of redness
I'm really gonna cover the whole area
and you can see that instantly the
redness is just completely gone it's
such a good strong concealer you don't
really need that much I've got two small
amout on my hand putting on my chin just
making sure all of those spots I've got
some concealer on and I'm just patting
I'm not doing any blending at the moment
just patting it on so it's not
activate the skin I'm quite lucky right
now that these these blemishes are
really more just like marks such as red
areas so not too raised and this just
completely neutralized the color of them
neutralize and neutralizes so I'm not
going to worry too much about blending
that because the blending really takes
place for the next step which is
foundation when it comes to foundation I
look for slightly heavier coverage when
I do suffer from bad skin but also I
don't want to block up my pores so for
that reason I'm going to be using this
one which is the pure foreign one liquid
14 hour where foundation I really like
the texture of this one it's a liquid
foundation so it does blend nice and
easily one pump is usually enough I put
that on the back of my hand and because
it is a mineral based foundation
it really doesn't block up the pores but
I still get the coverage that I need so
I'm just going to pop that on with my
finger and then I'm going to use my
trusty zoeva 102 silk finish brush just
to blend this alone it's actually a
little bit pale for me at the moment
because I've been over here in Costa
Rica but it still blends in really well
excuse the mirror I didn't have time to
do like a big proper set up this morning
so I'm just gonna hold my mirror I'm
using more of a dabbing motion here
usually I'd blend it a little bit more
like that but because I want to keep as
much of that coverage as I can I'm using
more of a dabbing motion which I find
keeps it keeps a little bit thicker
okay so I'm really happy with that
coverage but if you did want a little
bit more coverage I've still got a
little bit of redness on my chin and on
this area here then you can go in with
an even stronger concealer one that I
took away with me to Costa Rica and that
I just become obsessed with is this one
from Tarte which I got from QVC and it's
their rainforest of the sea aqua
concealer and this is a really heavy
duty concealer so again I've just pops a
little bit on my hand and I'm just
dotting it onto those areas I'm not
going to use the kind of dope that
applicator that it comes with just for
going because I don't want to transfer
any germs so putting another dot of that
onto my hand and then it's gonna Pat it
in to those areas and also whatever's
left under the eyes that's what we're
just brighten up that area and then
again I'm going to use my silver just
make sure it's perfectly blended I
always finish just by blending it down
the neck just to make sure that there is
no lines and that everything is a nice
even color so hopefully the camera is
picking up that I've got a nice kind of
glowy fresh complexion now and you can't
really see any redness or any blemishes
the only telltale sign is a few little
bumps but there's really not that much
you can do to cover up bumps unless you
really do cake on the makeup which is
not going to be good for for how you
look or for healing those blemishes so
I'm not going to add any more coverage
but what I am going to do is a little
bit of healthy color using some bronzer
and my favorite weather I've got a good
skin day or a bad skin day at the moment
is the hourglass ambient light Browns
err so I'm just going to use my shot to
be bronzing brush blush brush to add a
little bit of this into the usual areas
starting with the cheek a little bit of
kind of contour movement and doing that
figure of three where the Sun would
naturally catch just on the forehead
cheeks down the nose and not bit on the
chip make sure it's nicely blended so it
looks nice and natural and down the neck
again
keep all the same color and I really
find this bronzer it just gives such a
lovely healthy glow that you can
definitely get away with having the odd
pimple here and there because it just
gives you such a nice sunkissed look my
tongue sadly is fading and this is
really helping me to keep that healthy
radiant look to my skin so not going too
heavy on the bronze except I don't want
to dry out the skin but next I'm going
to move on it to eyebrows and for that
no change in my usual routine I'm going
to use my Urban Decay probita firstly
shaping the brows with the spoolie and
desperately need my brows doing soon
they are pretty horrendous and then the
scroll up pencil and just to fill in all
of those gaps so when I do my brows I
just tend to use really light stroking
movements just to almost replicate the
effect of hairs I am quite lacking in
the vertical it's the first part of the
brows I don't really have many hairs
there so I really do have to use a fine
pencil such as this one to almost draw
them in and try and replicate what house
would look like and then for the rest of
the brow where it's still a little bit
gapi I just use the pencil to fill it in
but not going too crazy because my hair
is quite light so we don't want anything
too bold filling in up to the arch
drawing in the line underneath and then
using really light strokes just to fill
in the gaps
that's my brows done sometimes I'll set
them with a liquid brow gel like benefit
gimme brow or or so on from earlier but
today I'm just saying at home so I'm not
going to do that now at this stage
because my foundation and the base has
had just a few moments to kind of set or
sink in I'm actually going to go in with
a powder which is from the same brand as
a foundation so it's pure and again this
is a mineral based powder so it's not
going to clog up any pores but it's just
gonna help to set that makeup because we
really don't want it sliding around
anywhere so I'm using my benefit
so I'm using my Real Techniques Bold for
metals powder brush or at least I think
it's called a powder brush not teach all
these ones don't have the names it's the
300 rush and I'm just gonna dock the
powder I'm only picking up a really
small amount and capping it off just in
the areas that my makeup tends to run
away during the day so under the eyes
down by the nose and also a little bit
on the chin and this just mattifies and
helps to set the makeup in place so even
if I do get a little bit shiny and I do
have oily combination skin so it's quite
likely this just really helps to set it
and stop me from getting those shiny
patches and makeup free patches during
the day also it's lovely about this one
is it does have a little bit of an
airbrush effect so it really helps to
just to create that flawless really well
blended appearance to your makeup you
could do this bit before the bronzer but
I just like to complete the base let it
kind of set for a few moments and then
go in with the powder as well as the
foundation having SPF this is also SPF
15 so really good like in the summer
months or any time of year really it's
always really good to make sure we have
some SPF protection on our faces now
that that's blended I'm going to put on
a lip oil and this is purely just for
comfort reasons and this is the instant
light lip comfort oil from Karen's I was
really gutted when these sold out last
year because I wasn't able to get my
hands on them but this year I actually
managed to get two I got this one which
is the honey flavor and also the
raspberry which is a pink one so put
that on before I start my eyeshadows so
it can just really be sinking in for my
eye shadow I'm going to be using this
absolutely ginormous palette which I got
from cult beauty and it's a brand called
morphe who are most well known for their
brushes and inside it's just the most
incredible value for money if you can
open it this humongous or is this
humongous selection of eyeshadows so I
picked up this one because it has a
lovely selection of neutrals and browns
but also going into some more purpley
shades which apparently are really
really good for hazel eyes so I do like
to experiment a little bit
in some color today however I'm going to
play it safe so I'm going to go in with
this kind of almost terracotta brown
color which I find it really really
flattering I'm just taking that on an
old two-faced makeup brush now wipe that
all over my eyelid kind of just a little
bit above the crease blending it all the
way in and I find that it's not too
dissimilar to my skin color so it just
creates a lovely even base with a hint
of color I find these shadows are
particularly powdery so it's definitely
importantly tap it off before you put it
onto your face because otherwise you
might end up with a little bit of eye
shadow down your cheeks but they aren't
really blendable in just a few seconds
that's all perfectly blended so I'm
going to go in with a slightly darker
shade I'm going to use this one here
just to add a tiny bit of definition to
rock doorbell just went off so I'm not
entirely sure where I was but I think I
was about to apply a darker color so to
create a little bit of definition on my
eyes I'm going in with a slightly darker
shade this one here and again I'm using
the same two-faced brush cutting off any
excess and then I'm just going to follow
it the crease of the eye just to add a
little bit of shadow in there so this
part the routine doesn't really have
anything to do with the fact that I'm
having a bad skin day but I just don't
want to go overboard on any part of my
makeup so I'm keeping it quite light and
natural-looking
just making sure this is really well
blended so don't have any harsh lines
and then taking the same color on a
slightly finer brush this is a zoeva
luxe petit crease 2/3 one brush just to
bring that color down to the lower lash
line so don't want to put any liner on
that area so it's nice to just bring
that color down just to make it a little
bit more
inglis on the eye area I'm just
finishing off that thing with a smaller
brush and then because sometimes when
it's that time of the month or when I am
suffering a little bit from poor skin
often my eyes are a little bit red and
bloodshot as well so for that reason I'm
going to use the Charlotte Tilbury I
cheat for bigger and brighter eyes and
this is a nude eyeliner pencil nude not
white because I find that white ones are
a little bit too harsh and too obvious
whereas this just really naturally makes
your eyes a little bit bigger and
brighter so I'm going to really
carefully draw this into my lower lash
line and I also have those pencil is
it's just so soft so you really don't
have to drag that delicate piece of skin
or risk hurting yourself with a really
scratchy pencil probably not very
flattering me trying to do this while
talking to you always tends to make my
eyes water a little bit but hopefully
you can see that it has made my eyes
look nice and big and bright and a lot
more awake and refreshed than they did
before and then to add some definition
to the top lash line I'm going to use a
really slim liquid eyeliner and this is
actually a gray one from L'Oreal I find
that gray just doesn't look as intense
or as harsh as black which is really
good on days like today and this is the
super liner in perfect slim so I'm going
to keep this really really close to my
top lash line and do a really tiny cat
flick but without going too crazy so
I've really tried to keep that line nice
and thin so I've not gone too bold with
the cat eye because I don't want any
part of this makeup look to really be
too intense or eye catching I just want
a really soft natural look and the next
thing I'm going to do is curl my lashes
and use a new mascara which I'm going to
trying out which is this new one from
Elizabeth Arden and it's their current
crammed grand entrance mascara dramatic
volume length and left still got it in
its box because it's new and I haven't
photographed it yet but this one I find
that the curl lasts a really really long
time in fact I'm not going to use
eyelash curlers because I do think of
this gives enough to curl by itself and
it's got a very likely scooped brush so
kind of similar to benefit roller lash
it really gets in there and lifts the
lashes right from the base and the
bristles are that stick plastic which is
my absolute favorite if it's possible to
have a favorite own bristle type but it
really helps to coat the lashes and comb
them at the same time so you really get
a lot of separation see without curling
and just in a few seconds I was given
real instant lift to my lashes and when
I tried this out before I found that
they didn't droop throughout the day so
I really am so impressed first
impression wise with this new mascara
not such a fan in the packaging I find
red is quite a bold color I guess with
Valentine's Day around this time of year
it's quite a nice change to the usual
black and gold and everything we have in
our makeup drawer so I went in a second
time on that eye and just added another
layer even in the first day I wasn't
properly that dry but you can see that
it's really given quite a lot of depth
and volume and a real intense black
color as well so I'm going to do the
same on this side it's wiggling the
brush slightly to comb the lashes I do
find it that the brush picks up quite a
lot of product so you do have to dab it
off a bit before you go in on the lashes
and then I'm just putting a tiny bit on
the lower lash line because you could go
overboard with this mascara wand so I'm
just kind of touching it really gently
to pick up a bit of color and I think we
are done with the mascara I've been
really really impressed with this one
recently so yeah Elizabeth Arden a grand
entrance mascara is this red one I'm not
entirely sure about yet but I'll leave
the information down below but so far
really really impressed with this and I
do find that my lashes continue looking
Reva luminous and color up day which is
great
and finally as it's been maybe like five
minutes since I applied the lip or my
lips are now nice and moisturized and
ready to go on with a lipstick and I'm
going to use my absolute favorite which
is the bite Beauty amaretto lip creme
lip crayon I think that's the right name
and I just find this shade it's just so
flattering so on days on my skin maybe
isn't perfect and I just want a nice
soft and subtle but very flattering lip
shade this is the one I always go for
and even though my lips have still go
but if oil on I find that this really
just glides on and still have good
lasting power so while this lipsticks
sometimes is quite matte on my lips
because I have done over the oil it's
got a little bit of a sheen today which
I quite like it's nice and fresh which
is exactly what you want to look like
when you might be having a bad skin day
and the very last step which is more
kind of for my comfort than anything
else is just to add a few spritzes
of the Neal's Yard white tea facial mist
so this is really rehydrating and
because I skipped out moisturizer in
favor for the Vichy my skin may not be
as moisturized as it normally is and at
the moment for me my skin is a little
bit dry anyway so this not only is it
nice and calming also its rehydrating
for the skin so the last thing I'm going
to do is just shake this up and apply a
few spritzes
and it has the most amazing smell as
well it's kind of mentally I'm not sure
what the ingredients are it kind of
smells like menthol mixed with palm and
violets in a really nice way not like a
sticky sweet way and that's it this is
the finished makeup look so hopefully
you'll agree it looks quite fresh quite
bright and definitely not bad skin day
at all I think I really credit all the
things that I use for the base starting
from the Vichy product I think that
really gets its skin a bit of a
kickstart when it comes to healing the
burr muscies and also the makeup that
I've used allows the skin to breathe as
well as providing enough coverage so I'm
really pleased with this finished look
considering how bad my skin was for me
to begin with hopefully you guys might
have picked up a few tips on what you
can do when you might be suffering from
a bad skin day and if you're lucky
enough to be blessed with good skin then
go away but also I hope that you have
just enjoyed this makeup routine do let
me know in the comments if there are any
products that you always reach for when
you might be having a bad skin Nicks I'd
love to know what concealer you use what
foundation you use and if there's any
products that you rely on to get rid of
any of those little blemishes if you've
enjoyed this video and don't forget to
