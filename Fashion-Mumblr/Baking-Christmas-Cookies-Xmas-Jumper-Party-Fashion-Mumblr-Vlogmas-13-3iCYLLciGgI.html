13 it's already after midday have to
blow on him when he wants all smelly um
but I've had quite a busy morning I've
been collecting this phone hello on this
station my lovely friend Vicky were
about to make some Christmas cookies and
we've just opened up some of my parcels
which included these little jars from
Neal's Yard and I didn't even know him
Neal's Yard maid would you want food
supplements did you just meet just me
didn't know so we can make a nice
healthy juice for breakfast Vic as the
queen of healthy juices my magic
assistant and they also got this which
is a massive I don't even know what to
call it from Krispy Kremes a bit huh
look at that magic cracker um so ya
gonna put the little man down and see
what's inside
so luckily it wasn't Donuts cuz I was
worried they'd be all squashed but
they've sent us a load of chocolates
three sets of three I really like to
look at this middle one I'm hoping it's
some kind of strawberry thing let me get
some hats we got some Krispy Kreme donut
hats and I think it's just low notes
fridge magnets my fridge is actually
wooden so might give those to my brother
and his little girl and most excitingly
a Krispy Kreme Gold Card no red card or
bisley which is basically a dozen donuts
every month for a year so what I really
want to go out and get some today for
our party tonight but I don't if I've
got time hopefully yay for our reindeer
horns on but before we get cooking I
just want to not let the little Dexter
entry that's for sure and I just want to
show you our wreath on the door the one
I made with the one that we made with
fig leaves so here it is
doesn't that look adorable it's so
beautiful
oh yeah really please do that so Vicki
and I are now going to make some
smoothies what you're thinking them back
story map matchup so a loose know what
matter maca is a micro natural different
very different and then bow up a bow
maybe seven cow okay and the mizzen
granola all right
yes so we've got all of our ingredients
out and our cookie cutters which pick
he's chosen the cutest ones got candy
cane a little Santa would you pull this
a little a little bit go gingerbread man
angel and a tree but not so well it's no
fake I thought we had a snowflake and
then we've got the ingredients which are
got plain flour bicarbonate of soda
butter ground cinnamon ground ginger
brown sugar and egg and some golden
syrup
so we're just trying to ice the
gingerbread man and I decided to look on
Pinterest to find a really easy icing
Hudson one for this one you didn't
thought I'll be pretty easy right health
of mine came out like I think I'm gonna
just test it so it turns out that icing
gingerbread men it's a little bit harder
than it looks
Vicky and I probably spent good part of
an hour icing them and I can't even I
can't even give you a face up because it
is so bad actually Vicki's done a good
job
rescuing some of them these are the ones
that we're the most proud of
thanks to Vicky's decoration skills
we've got a little gold blobs gold
glitter festive colored blob eul's I
think they're quite good so Vicky's gone
home now it's just me in the house for a
little while until Sophie and Hannah get
here which is actually gonna be any time
now but the cookies didn't turn out too
badly I have tried a couple and they
taste pretty good in fact I'm gonna have
another one now I've got like a bowl
here or less attractive ones going for
like an ombre looking it as a massive
fail um so yeah that's the bowl of ones
which I'm gonna nibble from but the ones
which we are actually going to put out
tonight our power to eat I've put on
this little stamp which I'll show you so
I got this stand it's just a cardboard
one from the Selfridges sale last year
actually it should have been twelve
pounds but I paid two pounds for it so
not looking too bad and then I've put
these little crispy cream things these
are chocolate which are going my Krispy
Kreme cracker so gonna put this on the
table now and tidy up a little bit
before the girlies get here so it's
about half-past seven now and I
completely forgot to pick up the vlog
camera up a little bit so I'm sorry um
but so Finn Henry here and we're all
getting ready to go downstairs for the
jumper party Charlie's downstairs back
from rugby now he's just making some
mulled wine and the how
smells so lovely in festive and I've got
my de buffers on and I went for this
Christmas jumper it's actually the third
one I've tried on tonight I tried on the
white one with the snowflakes and this
kind of Swedish she looking one with the
Christmas trees but the deal-breaker was
the fact that me Dexter and Charlie now
all have my king jumpers on which is
dunk here
we all have matching Christmas jumpers

your jumper from Charlie mine's a sauce
as well and Dexter's can you model it

hourglass bronzer and then Charlotte
