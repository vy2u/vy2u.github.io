another fashion mumbler on-the-go travel
vlog so I am in Barbados today I'm so so
excited to be here it is already one of
the most beautiful places I think I've
ever seen and we arrived late last night
we flew in with British Airways from
Gatwick and it was about an eight hour
flight so not too bad I did sleep a
little bit got a bit of work done
watched a few movies and we arrived in
the dark pretty much we were shown to
our rooms here at the crane hotel and
they are absolutely fabulous I will show
you all around later the weather
forecast has actually not been that good
and but thankfully we've woken up to
blue skies a little bit of clouding but
it's absolutely stunning so I'm going to
show you our view from the breakfast
room now and then take you along with me
for today's activities I think we're
heading to a farmers market and we're
here for the food and rum festival so
it's all going to be a lot of food a lot
of run rum so should be a fabulous few
days
I have no idea if you can hear me on
offices there's reggae music blaring out
speakers but we are on a catamaran
Maddie just my are just chilly wallaby
netting and I think we are going out to
sea and we're going to go to a shipwreck
we're going to go and hopefully still
missing turtles I'm so annoyed with
myself because I didn't bring my
underwater camera I'm such an idiot
it's in my hotel room so really annoyed
but I will just have to explain to you
the amazing things that you see I'm
sorry
they just got out of the sea we went for
a little swim with turtles yes fabulous
so many people when they were touching
them yeah so we just went for it went by
ourselves this is oh oh my gosh to see
it so yeah so nice typical Caribbean
weather we were just done making like
three seconds ago and now I wanna fight
as I see humans
a lot of people when they come to
Barbados like to stay in a villa because
it can work out a little bit more
cost-effective if you're coming for a
long period of time or with a big group
with a family so today we have come to
the beautiful illusion villa which is in
the Sugar Hill residential area just to
see what it's like to stay in a villa
and what you can do is you can have a
private share for private Butler while
you're here and you can even arrived
with a fully stocked up with food so
really easy and rather fabulous option
for hunting in Barbados we've just
arrived so let's take a little tour
and of course every luxury villa here in
barbados should comment with you
sidebar area which is where i am at the
moment as you can see our welcome gift
is some Mount Gay Rum which will
definitely be enjoying in a full side
cocktail later we have spent the past
few hours in the beautiful villa
illusion and we've now got changed and
we're about to head out to the Polo I'm
wearing my new self portrait dress
hopefully one of the girls girls get a
full outfit snap in a second cuz I'd
like to show you the full effect we're
going to take a few more photos and then
heading out I wanna photos everything
it is customers I want to put in we have
arrived at the Polo which is the next
event for the Barbados food and rum
festival and we're about to start
watching the game it's pretty much the
same setup as last night so you get your
ticket and then you can come in and
enjoy different dishes from the chef's
our favorite chef Jason is here this
afternoon making lots of nice tasty
nibbles so while the first matches on
we're going to go and get some rum here
handy
I wanna platinum
I wanna photos I'm in ring as well as we
move earrings
I wanna platinum see now they're
pissed imagine her cousins</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
