bloggers like to talk about the stuff
that they have put in their rubbish bin
yes today's video is my Beauty empties
slash mini reviews of products that I've
used up slightly less catchy title but
there we go same video so as I think I
said in my last empties video I've only
done one before this time it's gonna be
a little bit more substantial because
I've been saving for quite some time I
think that if a product managers to
become empty as far as beauty blogging
goes it's quite a high accolade because
we're really lucky that we get to try
out quite a lot of things and so things
often get put to the side when they've
only been used for a few weeks so
something is used right until it's
finished until it's an empty then it
must have been a source of good product
so for the majority of things in here I
absolutely love them so I'm not going to
rip out them too much but I'm just going
to go through them quite quickly and
there are a few exceptions in here there
are some products and how much bashes
throw anyway so I didn't like them so
yeah we'll get to those but no
particular order let's get started the
first thing in my little bag and by the
way the process of doing empties is also
a funny one basically I don't know about
other vloggers but I kind of leave this
carry bag underneath my bin my bin is
kind of like a wedge between my wardrobe
and an ottoman
I need this bag underneath the bin and
whenever I go to throw something empty
away and then I realize oh no I'll talk
about that in the video I stick it in
the bag and that process has kind of
been going on for the past four months
or so so yeah but I just tell you that
in case you're wondering you probably
already do that so the first thing that
was in my little carrier bag is this and
it's invisible eye bright seething I
know shocked that I was really gutted
when this ran out because I couldn't
justify buying another one so I had a
few other offenses from from video
honest I needed to try but had I not had
others to try this definitely would have
been repurchase it's such a lovely very
soft and gentle eye makeup remover is
Liz also there's no surprised I
absolutely love it I love all of her
skincare products but this was just
SuperDuper gentle eye makeup remover it
worked to treat it got rid of all my eye
makeup was really gentle it didn't kind
of like full of the under-eye skin there
so it really really loved this one and
when I finished the eye makeup remover
that I'm currently using which is
Charlotte Tilbury I'm not so in love
with it I find it have to give it a
little bit more rubbing I will be
repurchasing this next up I have an
origins my soul of water this is the dr.
Andrew Weil for origins mega mushroom
relief really long title its origins my
soul of water basically this again was
one that I really really loved as you
can see by the fact there's nothing left
in it I use in my cellar water every day
as part of my cleansing routine I use it
before I use another type of cleanser so
at the moment I'm using a Nivea micellar
water followed by LaSalle cleanse and
polish before the Nivea I was using this
I use them myself water to get rid of
the bulk of the makeup and then another
form of cleanser to get rid of the rest
of it which I find is a really good
routine for me as far as my Zilla waters
go this one is not that cheap it's I
think it's around 16 pounds but I'm not
entirely sure
and I think drugstore ones are just as
good but this is just really nice and
soothing the skin I think that's what
the mushroomy kind of part of the
ingredients do for this it just helps to
calm any redness but as I said if you
don't like to spend too much on your
skincare routine and budget ones are
just as good if you do like to spend
them a little bit more than this one is
really super great for any sensitivity
next I have the bumble and bumble a bit
blondish hair powder now this is one I
actually threw a way that's not empty in
fact there's quite a lot left in here
because I really did not like this I've
got quite light blonde hair and when I
use dry shampoo I like it to be light
blonde or white this was more of a
golden blonde so yes for some blonds it
might be great but for me it just made
me look like I needed to use a purple
shampoo on my hair like I hadn't washed
my hair even more and that just made it
look worse
so really didn't like this and I don't
know any girls in my friendship group
that have the right color hair this
would work for so I decided to throw
this away which is a shame because it
was expensive and normally I love
products and yeah really disappointed
with that here we have a dry shampoo
which I have actually finished this is
the collab dry shampoo in the shade
Monaco this had a really gorgeous
fragrance really fresh really light and
really clean which is what you want from
a dry shampoo not that my hair is smelly
when it's dirty but my hair does mine's
a little bit of volume and having that
extra and my scent just made it even
more lovely to use this it does give a
very light white powder which for
brunettes might not be ideal but for me
I really like it because it made my hair
look lighter and if my hair is in need
of a bit of a color top-up then that's
amazing and yeah I've already
repurchased this I have another dry
shampoo vo gosh what's this thing about
my hair routine I promise you I do
actually wash my hair this is the
Richard Ward keratin plus one day dry
shampoo another really good one but it
was more pricey than the collab and it's
more expensive also than batiste and to
be honest I think they are very
comparable so I'd save you money and go
for a collab or parties I have another
empty my slow water here this is one of
the Nivea daily essentials sensitive
three in one and micellar cleansing
water this is a really really good
drugstore micellar water absolutely love
this I love it just as much as the
origins but it's a lot cheaper and I
think has more in the bottle this is 200
mils
this is George ml as well I thought that
Nivea would have more in it but they're
the same yeah absolutely love this does
what it says on the tin and generally a
really good makeup remover next I have
the Thomas cocoa butter natural bronze
body lotion now this I've finished just
before Christmas and it was pretty much
my not everyday every time I'd showered
I would apply this just to give my skin
a little bit of color without having to
go down the whole fake tanning route so
by using this twice or three times a
week I would just always have a little
bit of color without being fully fake
tan so it's really nicely we just want
to consistently have a bit of a healthy
glow to you this also
smell which is just the holy grail of
anything tanning wise it's a gradual tan
so it's really good if you're not very
good at telling yourself and I haven't
repurchase this yet because I've just
been pale recently and when I have
needed to tan I've used the he-she one
hour tan but I will definitely be
repurchasing this Oh actually I've got
the Dove summer body but the new one the
Dove down the spa and to try next summer
you're purchasing for a little bit but
I'm sure I will in a few months time
next in my little bag of goodies I've
got a couple of different serums by
origins I love origins serums there's
something about them that is almost
quite mattifying to my skin which as
you'll know from my videos I do tend to
get a little bit shiny so if a serum can
be in any way mattified then I just
absolutely love it
origins skincare in general I am a huge
huge fan and I've used up their original
skin serum and they're a perfect world
serum both of them have just worked
wonders for my skin I find I'm just
always having a good skin day when I use
these both of them I would again say I
do purchase by matching using a dark and
Sarah at night which I'm also loving
I've just been having a really good run
with serums recently so won't be
purchasing them just yet and I'd say
between the two I probably go for a
perfect world just because it does have
even more mattifying it's not a
mattifying serum but on my skin it
leaves an almost benefit Porefessional
kind of silicone II feel but not as much
as that so it feels like a really good
makeup base to this is quite a luxurious
one so this is the Bamford Bamford
Bamford botanics sugar body polish now
this is a very very luxurious product
it's not cheap it's a very very
luxurious is the only word I can use for
this but it's a body scrub with really
really big granules and the fragrance of
this it just reminds me of like really
posh spas and lovely lovely holiday
destinations posh hotels have pampered
in their bathroom sometimes I know the
hotel I went to fish dad had it and it
was just so incredible the smell always
reminds me of that
but this was their sugar body polish I
thought for value for money it's not
that great so I won't be repurchasing
yet because I think it's about 40 pounds
and you get what 200 yeah 200 ml of body
polish in here and I think that
sanctuary and other ones rituals they're
just as good but if you do love to have
a really really pampering a bath and
good old scrub then this was perhaps you
super and the smell kind of an escrow I
can't even describe to you how
incredible that smothers then I've got a
shampoo and conditioner these are the
little shampoo and conditioners I finish
these quite some time ago
and I didn't repurchase just because I
have a lot of different shampoos and
conditioners in my cupboard and I love
to really mix up my hair care routine
I find that my hair I kind of keep it on
the edge by and keep it on its edge by
continually changing my shampoo
conditioner so that doesn't get kind of
immune to anything which my hairdresser
said is a really good thing but so this
is the oh I lied this is the energizing
body scrub but I did finish the shampoo
- maybe I told you about that in there
in the last empties video the body scrub
was amazing again a little bit pricey
for a body scrub and I find that my net
in these tubs like this I use them in
about three showers so not great value
for money but a lovely product with a
lovely smell and this is the bow Tanic
shine conditioner which is really really
good for my hair I just found it it's
sorted really easily into my hair
routine if that makes sense so it works
really well with other products I was
using I think others I'll have three
different types of conditioners this one
is for normal hair I also have the one
for dry hair which is what I'm using at
the moment alongside at resume oil one
because my has been colored recently I
highly highly recommend these I think
there are
a little bit on the high-end scale price
point wise but they really do do a very
good job with what this Anton basically
then we have some similar products that
have fallen to the bottom we have the
dolphin ideal resource and night cream I
was so so sad when this ran out because
I absolutely loved this part of my night
routine I also used the dolphin
revitalizing oil which was in my 2015
top ten beauty products and yeah the the
two of those work really well together
this as far as a night cream goes
because it's dark I'm you know it's
gonna have just the most incredible
fragrance and just works absolute
wonders on the skin I did find sometimes
I'd wake up my skin would still be a
little bit oily or shiny but that was
fine once I used on my solar water but
overall this really regulated out my
skin and I just woke up on those days of
having a really really good skin day and
I credit this and the oil of really
lovely evening combination why don't you
forgot about this product and so they
put it out but pulled it out the bag but
now I remember how much I love this
stuff it's the Liz L botanical shine and
nourishing hair oil for me when my hair
is wet I need to put oil in the end so I
can brush it through before I blow dry
and this was what I used to use of that
until it run out and I just absolutely
loved it it was really good at
detangling it stopped any flyaway hair
stopped any prisoners and just a
generally really good product it's very
nourishing to the ends and smelt great
smell it felt good so yeah all round a
really really lovely product which I
highly recommend and I think Lori llv
visit cheaper version of this which I
also love but if you want something just
a little bit more special or maybe
L'Oreal maybe Lori out the thief isn't
quite enough for your hair and I highly
highly recommend this absolutely love it
and will be repurchasing so next is a
little mini and this is the pure ology
color fanatic what's actually called
multitasking hair beautifier
how beautifier doesn't really summarize
what it does and I don't even know if I
was using this correctly but basically
when my hair was wet I was spritzing
this all throughout my hair like the
little oil before I brushed it and
refried blow dried it so this again I
needed it for its conditioning
and for detangling otherwise I could not
get a hairbrush and through my hair and
now have the full-size version of this
but I'm looking for more travel sizes
because I used to keep this in my travel
bag when I went away overnight anywhere
wherever I went on holiday this would
always be in my travel bag and I
absolutely relied on this for being able
to brush my hair after coming out of the
shower so we'll be repurchasing minis
and have already we purchased the full
size last a few bits and pieces and a
few hairs so we've got that this works
plus deep sleep pillow spray these are
just absolutely incredible I don't know
if they are placebos or if they
genuinely do what they say they do and
which is help you trip to sleep and have
a really nice calming evening sleep but
they really do work I find that I see
much better I have better dreams and I
drift off a drift off a lot more quickly
when choice spritzes both about pillows
with this we've now got the full sized
version and I've probably gone through
about three or four of these minis so I
always take them with me when I go
traveling I just spread it on the pillow
I find it especially when I'm not in my
own bed I find it quite hard to sleep so
I really notice the difference when I
don't have this I find it takes me hours
to get to sleep
whereas when I spritz this on the pillow
I'm just gone like within minutes
completely so this works really really
well
I find the minis seriously handy and
I've also got the full-size one so
definitely recommend this and we'll be
repurchasing nominees although I think I
have a few that have been in birch boxes
recently so don't need to repurchase I
have a couple of eyebrow products these
are both eye of horus ultimate brower
defined pencils and I also recently ran
out of my Anastasia brow ways but
doesn't seem to be in the bag I actually
thought one of these was one but now
they're both I of course but all three
I've horas these two and the Anastasia
brow ways were just the most incredible
brow products now I'm using
okay bro beta which I love as well but I
think that these these two plus the
anesthesia were just that tiny bit
better color wise these are a perfect
match for my eyebrows I found that they
looked really really natural and very
very slim and pencils which is great if
you want to almost create that define my
hair like a stroke in your eyebrows
which I definitely did need to do so
these were amazing and I picked these up
in America I think with another one from
Sephora so when I next go to New York I
will be topping up with more fees last
two products I feel like I've been going
at 100 miles an hour one of them is the
vo5 hot oil intensive pre shampoo
treatment now this came in a box of
about eight I only used one because I've
started them a pain to use and I didn't
notice that much difference with my hair
so I didn't even use the others I think
I still like in my hair covered
somewhere maybe my hair wasn't dry
enough that really needed these maybe
I'll do it again that my has been
colored I'm making it a bit more
treatment but basically with these you
fill at the sink or filler cut with
really hot water to heat the oil you
pull it all through your hair and then
you shampoo and conditioners normal and
it's meant to really intensely nourish
your hair and bring moisture especially
to the ends if you have dry ends but to
be honest for all the fat I just don't
really notice that much difference with
my hair afterwards and it was just
another thing to add to your shower
routine so not sure if I recommend these
as I said my maybe my hair wasn't bad
enough and it needed these but yeah it's
a difference I won't be repurchasing and
finally and I did have two of these in
here and why definitely thrown away two
of these but I must have put one in the
actual bin instead of this bag but this
is one of my bite Beauty matte lip creme
crayons and over know the actual name
mat creme lip crayon by bite Beauty in
the shade amaretto this is another
product that was in my 2015 top 10
beauty products and I just absolutely
love these lipsticks as such gorgeous
colors gorgeous formula they're not
drying they're not too
they're not too shiny and they're so
easy to apply because of the shape of
the actual bullets so just something
that I used to use I think maybe eight
months of this year I hope uses an
everyday lip stick
I don't have it on now because I just
put on some lip balm this one benefit
chart it's a favorite um but yeah I've
got through two of these at least this
year I've got two more in my lipstick
tour and I'm dreading the day that those
run out but again when I next go to
Sephora I'll be tugging on top of it
topping up on these because it's just
such a gorgeous lip color pretty much my
signature lip color if I can have a
signature lip color who knows but
absolutely love these highly recommend
them and we'll definitely be
repurchasing so that's it my rubbish bag
is now empty and all of these rubbish
items can now go where they finally
belong which is in the actual bin so
yeah I hope you guys have enjoyed it
looking through my empties with me sorry

little bit hyper and just word vomited
that whole video at you but yeah so
loads of really great products there
lots of things which I'll be
repurchasing hopefully it's been useful
for you to use things that I've actually
run out of which as I said is the
highest accolade of products when it
