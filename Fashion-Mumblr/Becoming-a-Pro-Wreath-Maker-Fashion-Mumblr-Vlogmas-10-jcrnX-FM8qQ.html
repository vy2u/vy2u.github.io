it is wednesday today and i've got
another really fun that day ahead so i'm
really looking forward to taking you
with me
I've got a lunch meeting soon which
we're gonna be quite boring um then I've
got another wreath making class so I'm
literally gonna be a pro wreath made
crap by the end of this festive season
um and that is with fig leaves and I've
also got a makeup session with Tom Ford
not actual Tom Ford but Tom for beauty
and Selfridges um I think I'm gonna go
get my eyebrows done because they are
looking pretty atrocious um and I also
know that I've got some really fun
things in my pierre box down the road
but I don't have time to go and get them
which is really stressing me out and I
know that one of the things is when new
phone you got the rose gold iPhone 6s
and and yeah just so excited to go and
get it but I don't have time it's gonna
be shot by the time my event finishes
tonight but anyway um I wanted to
quickly show you what I got in my goodie
bag from the benefit event yesterday
because the girls were talking us
through the products that they were
launching and they sound amazing so that
we just have a little a little rummage
in the side so let's see what we've got
so the first thing is the new product
launch which is the professional matte
rescue and for me for my skin type this
just sounds like an absolute dream come
true so they've got a new packaging
let's open it up and show you so this is
the new packaging it's kind of silver
it's all about like break for glass and
emergency which i think is really good
fun and it's mattifying pour blurring
and the visible finish and I actually
felt some of this on the back of my hand
at the event yesterday and it's clear
unlike the silicone II kind of cream
from the last one and it feels
incredibly lightweight a little bit like
a more watery version of Illamasqua
hydra veil if you felt that one but
meant to be really good for oily skin so
I can't wait to try that one I would
have tried it this morning but I've
slept on my shoulder chilling washed
erisa and forgot but I'm gonna use that
tomorrow and I'm excited to give it a go
and another thing that's in there
which I'm so excited to try cuz I am
stressed all the time about my pores and
blackheads and all that gross stuff and
they've released these which are the
Porefessional super cleaning masks and
they're basically strip masks which go
over your nose and cheek area which is
where am I blackheads the worst and I
have to show you this is what cuz it's a
really really cool little design a
really good idea you get eight pouches
in the box and they look like this
so you pop this to release some kind of
special ingredients into the mask to
give it a slush around and then put the
mask on there I think then you have to
wait like 25 minutes 10 minutes 10
minutes and then use the other side of
white ruler after 10 minutes take off
the mask and use the other side to wipe
the poor prone area do not rinse so I
think I might actually do that tonight
cuz and charlie is gonna go to the
cinema by himself which is interesting
I'm gonna be out into the half 8 and he
wanted to watch a film at quarter past 9
I will be home in time it's a new trend
yet one he was like I'm just gonna go by
myself so I have a pan that you thing
and try those out also in the goodie bag
hohohoh a little milk chocolate Santa
from Hotel Chocolat which I will
demolish shortly and that's cute a
little Hotel choco la festive wreath my
favorite it's tears Claire sees my
favorite things in the world let's have
a look what kind they are so festive
chocolate oh that's so cute Merry
Christmas
our friends of benefit are so cute look
how gorgeous they are
I love biscuit ears they're chokers are
just the best so I'm gonna enjoy that
later when I get home with my cup of tea
and I hide them so joy doesn't pinch
them and yeah I think that's about
everything in there that's a product
from another meeting it's a lovely
little goodie bag from benefit so I do a
very quick outfit
day before I head out because I think
it's quite cute just tied my hair into a
little side plat because um it was
annoying me and I've got my can you see
these my little Miu Miu sunglasses what
you've got from sunglasses hearts and
they've got this lovely oh god that's
really hard to do um
there's lovely kind of sparkly side
which i think is actual crystals so yeah
love those my jumper is last year's Jack
Wills Christmas jumpers I think it's
actually my favorite Christmas jumper
and is definitely okay like we're out
and about because not to you know what's
the word I've got him I'm because
everyone doesn't like it'll not be
festive but it's still quite chic and
like feral and you know vintage ski
style white jeans cream jumper not
really sure if you should do that but
I'm doing it anyway and these are my
boots from UM pretty little thing so you
might have seen these in my Black Friday
haul and I love them yes I think it's
quite like a festive chic white washout
you know that kind of look
oh and I painted my nails this morning
in a new bourgeois nail varnish I was
going to do white fair I'll print on top
with this new kit that I got but I
didn't have time so I'll probably do
that tonight sharing my pump evening

just died so I'm gonna have to finish
the vlog on my phone but yeah Charlie
and I are both gonna try out the new
benefits professional face mask did you
read it you have to squish it in so it
says we have to press firmly on a
plastic bubble to release the poor serum
okay so Charlie and I got these masks on
our faces and it's quite hard to know
which side is which is the right one to
put them on your face but okay I've got
it on right don't if you can tell what
my eyes are watering are your eyes
watering yeah I feel like it's so strong
that I can like feel it going the
vapours going into my eyes so we're
gonna leave it on for 10 minutes yeah it
feels really strong so I'll leave on for
10 minutes if I can handle it it's like
some weird reaction it's really stinging
is this right we're gonna put up with
this for as long as you can and let you
know how we get on okay so 10 minutes
has gone by and the stinging did go down
it was actually really making my eyes
water to begin with it's kind of
starting to fall off now it's not I was
slightly just point except though it's
been one of those masks where you peel
it off and it pulls actually pulls it
out of your skin and you can like see
the blackheads yeah really really gross
but yeah I thought every one of those
but hopefully it's just gonna hopefully
it made my skin a little bit clearer I
can't really see in this light but um
yeah I definitely felt like it was doing
something but I am now just going to
edit today's vlog and enjoy my don't if
