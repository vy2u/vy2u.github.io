having a super day today I thought I'd
share with you a bit of the beginners
beauty guide so I actually asked on
snapchat what you would like to see and
someone replied saying why don't you do
a kind of drugstore Beauty kit for
beginners and I said that's a really
nice idea something that I haven't
really seen that much of on YouTube and
I thought it'd be really useful maybe
you are just kind of getting into makeup
or I just starting to put together your
very first beauty kit then I thought I'd
do this video just for you so all of
these products are ones which I
personally absolutely love and I use on
a really regular basis loads of which
I'm sure you'll have heard me talking
about in other videos but they're full
products which you can get from any
drugstore weather boots or super drug or
motorcycle in America
CVS wherever you are you can find these
products in pretty much any drugstore
and they're all really simple and easy
to use so great for your very first
Beauty starter kit so the first thing is
foundation and this is actually totally
optional if you really don't like that
feeling of having anything on your skin
then you can skip this step out
altogether
perhaps just use some concealers on
areas that you maybe want to hide but
for me I personally love a little bit of
extra coverage so I always like to start
off my makeup with some foundation if
you're after something a little bit
lighter then you can go for a BB cream a
CC cream or a tinted moisturizer now I
know that sounds really really scary but
don't worry that all pretty much the
same loads of these kind of products
have SPF in them moisturizer primer skin
loving ingredients so you really don't
need to worry about a thorough skincare
routine beforehand and the one that I've
got here is the soap &amp;amp; Glory make
yourself a youthful CC cream now this is
a really lovely lightweight one almost a
watery feel so it doesn't feel like
you've got too much product on your skin
which I absolutely love and just a
couple of drops of this will go a really
long way without making a look or so
you've got a lot of makeup on still
giving your skin a lovely finish and a
nice base to build on the rest of your
makeup look with if you're off to
something with a little bit more
coverage perhaps you want a bit more of
a blank canvas or you just want to cover
up a few more infections then a
foundation is the best thing to go for
and no surprises here I'm recommending
the Rimmel match perfection foundation
this you will be
to death of hearing me talking about if
you do watch a few of my videos because
I talk about this all the time I
absolutely love the finish of this I
find it really perfecting it's almost
like an instant airbrushed effect on the
skin it's a little bit thicker than a
tinted moisturizer or a BB cream so
great if you do want a little bit more
coverage if you are going out for a
special occasion or if maybe if you're
having a not-so-good skin day then this
is one which I highly recommend from the
drugstore but sometimes you might just
not want to wear foundation perhaps you
don't want to cover your entire face in
some makeup and in which case the next
thing for your beauty starter kit would
be a concealer now concealer is really
good for targeting those specific areas
maybe the under eye circles or a little
bit of redness anywhere on your face a
favorite of mine which I want to tell
you guys about is the Rimmel match
perfection
two-in-one concealer and a highlighter
now I personally love this one because
of its really creamy texture and it
blends in so easily so whether you're
using your fingers or a brush and even
if you're using a non fair skin or on
top of a foundation I just find this
blend absolutely flawlessly now
personally I use this everywhere whether
that's under the eyes or in any areas of
redness any spots I find this a really
good multitasking concealer and
apparently its skin tone adapting so
maybe that explains why it blends so
well so definitely recommend this one
and again available in the drugstore the
highlight part of this concealer means
you can do the under eye areas you can
kind of contour the nose a little bit
even use it in the shadows under the
lips without having to go contour and
highlight crazy so you really do not
need to be a pro when it comes to
highlighter and things like that this
kind of does the job for you and the
next thing is a powder a powder is
really great at setting down all the
products as you've already applied to
your face so maybe you've just put on
foundation maybe you've gone foundation
concealer perhaps even a cream blush
then the next thing to do is apply a
powder because it really sets it all in
place and prevents your skin from
getting too shiny or too oily personally
I would recommend a pressed powder like
this one this is the silk addition
powder from Bourjois
I find that with loose powders they just
tend to create a bit of a mess and if
you don't know what you're doing so much
then you're probably gonna end up with
all over the place like I very often do
so a pressed powder is exactly that it's
powder which has been pressed into a
compact so it's not gonna fluff around
all over the place and stay in your
carpets this one is a pressed powder and
it comes with a little sponge which I'm
not going to show you because -
absolutely disgusting full of makeup but
it's really super easy to just Pat onto
any areas that you think might get oily
or indeed anywhere that you've put
makeup on to keep it in place this one
also has a little mirror in the lid so
you can take it out and about with you
so if your skin is prone to a little bit
of oiliness and shininess then you can
just top this up on the go and mattify
your skin next up is bronzer and bronzer
is another thing which you don't have to
have in your makeup kit if you don't
want to personally I don't think that my
makeup is ever complete without a little
bit of bronzer I think it's really great
for adding a bit of a healthy glow to
your skin and you can also give your
face a little bit more shape using the
right bronzer I'd say if you are
struggling to find your shade and you've
narrowed it down to a couple go for the
lighter one because you can always build
up the color and it's much much harder
to take it away and blend it out if
you've gone a little bit too dark one
which I love from the drugstore is soap
&amp;amp; Glory solar powder this one is a
little bit shimmery but not too shimmery
so it gives the skin a lovely glow but
you're not going to be shining or
sparkly in any way and I think for the
drugstore the color payoff of this one
gives is really really super you're
never going to be a risk of going orange
but instead just have that glow as
though you spent a little bit of time in
the sunshine which is exactly what you
want for your bronzer now when I apply
bronzer I start by using a large brush
like this one from Real Techniques and I
start by actually applying it in the
area where you would do contouring now
don't worry I'm not going to suggest
that as a beginning you start to try and
do some contouring but if you apply it
in this area of the cheeks and not only
are you going to give your face a little
bit of shape but you're also kind of
figuring out the shade that you've got
on your brush so you can blend it out
really easily and make sure that the
color is right before you go on to the
rest of your face and then once I've
done this area I tend to use kind of
figure 3 movement just to bring a little
bit of color to the tops of my face and
underneath the chin as well just areas
that the Sun would naturally catch your
face or where you want to build
a little bit shadow also on the cheeks
you can bring in a little bit of color
with some blush again optional but if
you want to just add that nice rosy glow
then there are some really lovely
blushes available in that drugstore one
of my favorites being this one I'm
actually this palette from makeup
revolution it's got a huge selection
inside it but one that one that I
absolutely love is this one here it's a
very lovely light pink and it has a
little bit of showing it as well so
again can be used for highlighter but if
you're looking for a drugstore blusher
then this would definitely be the kit
that I recommend and you can really play
around with all the different shades
that are inside and figure out which one
suits your skin tone now when you're
applying blusher you just need to smile
at yourself in the mirror and find the
apples of your cheeks this area which
kind of like sticks up in your cheeks
and just a little bit of blusher to the
apple of the cheek and then bring it up
underneath the eye towards the hairline
and that's all you do keep blending it
from the apples of the cheeks up towards
the hairline in kind of like above the
ear direction keep blending it and
you're done
really really easy next up is eyes and
you really don't need anything too
complicated here in fact you can use
just one shade if you do want a little
bit more of a selection however then I
recommend getting a very neutral colors
palette such as I cannot open this for
the life of me this one here from H&amp;amp;M
now this is that smoky nude eyeshadow
palette if you are feeling a little bit
timid and don't want to go too crazy
then I recommend using a color just a
little bit different from your skintone
to create a nice even base over the
eyelid you can use something a little
bit shimmery or a little bit darker if
you want to go that extra step or you
can even use a slightly darker shade on
the crease which is basically when you
have your eye open it's that area where
there's a little bit of a fold and if
you take the brush and just lightly
brush it over that area then you'll
bring a little bit more shape into the
eye socket area lighter shades such as
this one here can be used underneath the
brow bone but personally I hardly ever
do that and then bright shades can be
used to really brighten the eyes you can
use this all over the lid or dot it
inside the corners of the eyes here just
to make yourself look as though you've
had 10 hours sleep and really you've
probably had a lot less than that
one thing that my makeup kit would not
be complete without is mascara mascara
is just the most powerful product for
creating that really wide-awake look
opening up the eyes and just
such a transformation on your face I
think if I was to go to a desert island
and couldn't only take one piece of
makeup it would be mascara one that I
really love is great lash by Maybelline
I don't think I've ever spoken about
this before but this was the first
mascara that I ever used and I still
love it to this day for no makeup days
or days and I want when we look to be a
little bit more natural I will always go
for this one there's something just so
easy to use about it nothing fancy it's
a very plain and simple mascara wand but
it really works to separate out the
lashes mascara czar usually available in
black and brown i recommend brown if you
want a slightly more natural look or if
you are slightly darker hair color or
you just want slightly more of a
dramatic look then you can go for black
mascara something you can use if you
want to create an even more wide-eyed
look is eyelash curlers these are gained
not completely necessary if you don't
want to bring some contraption close to
your eyeballs then you can just curl
your lashes with your fingers just press
against your lashes press them towards
your eyebrows just after you've applied
mascara when it's going a little bit
tacky and that really does work without
having to use a little scary contraption
like eyelash occurs but honestly they
are really really easy to use and I love
my pair which out of rose gold pair from
tweezerman they are a lot easier to use
and they look and really really not that
scary at all and I find that they make a
lot of difference so if you're looking
for something to make your eyes even
more wide awake an even brighter and
wider open already said that then I
definitely recommend some eyelash
curlers as well the next thing is brows
and I actually didn't use anything on my
brows for quite some time I'd say I've
only been really concerned in my brows
for the past couple of years and only
since I was really in my very late teens
and early 20s but I know that brows are
such a big thing these days that you
probably would not dare walk out the
house without doing something to your
brows so for that reason I'm including
sofa glories archery brow pencil in that
this little beauty starter kit because
it's just such a natural looking color
and incredibly easy to use so if you're
just starting out with your eyebrows and
I recommend getting some type of pencil
there are brown mooses brow gels all
kinds of things available but for me
personally I think a pencil is the
easiest type of product to use because
it's so easy to just draw in or fill in
any gaps of just draw in a little bit
more shape into the brows this has
felt-tip pen type nib on one end which
personally I'm not the biggest fan of
but also kind of like a wax crayon type
tip on the other end which is what I
love to use for filling in any gaps at
the beginning of my brows and then just
building it a little bit more shape and
color
next is lips and I never feel that my
makeup look is complete until I have put
something on my lips whether that's
something is a bomb or a gloss or a lip
stick it doesn't matter I just always
have to put something on my lips before
leaving the house now my favorite thing
to do especially in the colder months is
apply a colored balm and I find that
this is perfect because it has the
benefits of a balm you get the
moisturization sometimes in SPF and the
healing properties of a balm but also
some color if you go for a tinted balm a
couple of my favorites are from Carmex
they have loads of different colored
balms I've got the light pink one and a
coral one and they really do add just a
very soft hint of color to the lips but
without being all-out like a bold
lipstick if you do want something a
little bit bolder then I definitely
recommend lip crayons that crayons are a
lot easier to apply than an lipstick
because of the shape that they come in
they've got a really easy to use type
nib applicator and so you don't need a
liner either because it's so easy to
draw a precise a shape onto your lips
and then fill it in revlon have a really
lovely color selection here i've got
their colorburst matte balm in the shade
sultry some free sand that's what i've
actually got on my lips at the moment
which i think again is quite a nice easy
color to wear so great too for your very
first makeup kit and so of course you're
going to need something to apply your
new makeup so if you're looking to get
something from the drugstore then you
cannot be too Real Techniques they have
a few different sets I'm sure one of
them is actually called the beginner set
or the starter kit and that comes with a
powder brush a foundation brush I'm sure
it even comes as an eyeshadow brush and
a contour brush but I will leave all the
information down below because I can't
be too short but Real Techniques they
are designed by two Beauty youtubers
pixie Oh Sam and Nick Chapman so you
know that they've just sort of
everything they really are incredible
quality easy to use and I have used
these for so long and yet they still
feel like they're an absolutely perfect
almost brand-new condition so incredible
value for money and ideal products for
your very first makeup kit last but
absolutely not least I wanted to tell
a little bit about skincare now the
world of skincare is just absolutely
crazy there are so many products out
there it's so easy for it to just go
completely over your head because there
is just almost too much choice but I
whittled it down to just a couple of
products so your very first and for your
very first introduction to skincare
firstly a lovely easy to use in my cell
of water now my scent of water is great
because it really does pull all the
makeup and any imperfections out of your
skin so it's a great deep clean but
without being too harsh on the skin and
it's so easy to do with my cell of water
you don't need to get the face wet you
don't have to tie your hair back all you
do is pour a little bit onto a cotton
pad and wipe it over the face trap the
cotton pad away and you've done so it's
super duper easy
I love Nivea I love Garnier there's so
many different ones out there but this
one I picked up is Olivia gentle
carrying micellar water so great if I'm
not sure how sensitive your skin is you
really don't want to risk your skin
coming out in any kind of reaction so go
for something sensitive and just as it
sensitive doesn't mean it's not going to
work as well because this is ab c
incredible for removing all traces of
makeup even waterproof mascara and then
sometimes your skin needs a little bit
of extra care which is why you might
need to exfoliate exfoliating works to
get rid of that top layer of skin so any
try nurse or patchiness your skin might
be experiencing will hopefully be solved
by exfoliating and again I recommend you
start with something gentle for the skin
so this is the st. Ives sensitive skin
apricot scrub and it's specially
formulated for sensitive skin as I said
there are so many products out there
it's really easy to just get bombarded
with information but the key is to keep
it simple and listen to what your skin
needs when that skincare makeup or
anything but sometimes it's really good
to just strip it back to basics I really
hope that the products that I've shown
here have given you some idea on some
things you can bring it into your
skincare or beauty routine without
having to go whole hog and buy
absolutely everything available on the
high street
as I said everything that I've spoken
about here is something which I
use myself products which I love and I
know a really simple and easy to use so
hopefully you'll found this video useful
