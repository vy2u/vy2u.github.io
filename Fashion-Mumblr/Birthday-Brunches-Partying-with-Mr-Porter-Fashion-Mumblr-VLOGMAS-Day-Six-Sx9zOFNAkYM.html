and welcome today six of blog much as my
challenges are starting vlogs in weird
places I'm pretty sure no one has ever
started a blog in a trampolining hard
before so I'm here with these two crazy
girlies licky licky and we're here for
this one's birthday we just had a
fabulous breakfast out shortage house
which I tried to show you but you're not
out to film it now so sing a little bit
sneaky and we're now at flip out ones
were being crazy cat on the trampoline
bye
these boys want to say hi who's your
favorite youtuber guys I think you're
making I audio yeah but we don't care
having trouble back
back home again and I should have been
on route back into central London right
now to go for afternoon tea with Galan
um but annoyingly this morning i've got
i got an email from a brand asking me to
reshoot some content i'm doing for them
so i feel so so bad but i've had to
cancel my afternoon tea which is so
annoying because i just love the girl
and girls and their products i was
really looking forward to catching up
with everyone and they also take letting
people down so but miffed about that
button back home now hopefully gonna
have a really productive couple of hours
I was just getting so stressed earlier
obviously today was to Vicki's birthday
and I don't know I really need to like
work on my work-life balance i was
talking to the girls about it because
when you're your own boss there's no
days off there's no like holiday days
you're just constantly working so yeah
being a little bit bogged down with my
to-do list and all the things i need to
do you're right sausage he's like a
puppet like a rag doll it was silly um
so yeah it's quite nice to like take my
mind off work this morning for breakfast
we had some Prosecco Prosecco before
midday on a monday is definitely a great
way to start a week and then we went to
flip out and we're just absolutely loony
on the trampolines which was great fun I
look a little bit scary because
trampoline Lee is not the most
flattering thing to do so going to have
a super quick shower and then I'm going
to do some work do the content that I
need to do for that brand so annoying um
and then there is a mr. Porter event
tonight so it's actually a men event but
I work with net-a-porter so I've been
invited to go along as well though that
should be really good fun um yeah see
you after my shower I'm also very
excited to be reunited with this little
chap yes just downstairs doing some work
now off my shower my hair is incredibly
fluffy I've had a fairly productive few
hours I've done those emails then if you
guys are bored about me talking about
work but this is the real life of a
blogger just constantly editing photos
like I'm doing now scheduling blog post
doing emails emails take so long there's
just so so so much to do
I also have my phone playing background
i'm watching penn and Katie's latest
vlog Ben and Katie have a youtube
channel called the lady and gent and
they do like wiki vlogs and it's quite
nice for me to watch them we actually
used to live with an encoding they're
good friends of ours and I'm just a bit
nosy so yeah I like to watch their vlogs
but if you like couple vlogs like Mitch
lacks or the saucony Jolie's then
definitely check out their channel and
yeah I just really enjoyed them they're
both they're so cute they're so in love
they're recently married and they just
do the funnest things they both just
borrowed a BMW i8 i think it was for a
weekend like this supercar um and they
stay in fancy hotels and go out for
lovely dinners so yeah i'll leave that
channel linked down below you will have
met them a couple of days ago at the
charles heidsieck champagne dinner when
I've loved that so yeah go check out
their channel I just love to have it on
in the background and see what they're
up to so I'm gonna finish editing a few
photos now I've also got oh my god oh my
gosh look at this little chap I mean
look how comfortable this boy is yeah
when a hard day baby this is how my
little chap spends the afternoon you
little poor dyndns let me love you so
much
yeah my boy my boy I've just finished
working it's half past six and I'm going
to go upstairs in a second and start
doing my makeup but I've just come into
the kitchen because I wanted to show you
something really really lovely which was
delivered today and it is down here let
me show you properly it is this
absolutely gorgeous gingerbread house
which was sent to me from locks tan and
as you guys know lock stands one of my
favorites beautiful shower gels hand
creams etc etc just how beautiful is
this someone has spent so long putting
little bits of lavender which obviously
links back to the L'Occitane on Provence
region in France someone has carefully
done the detail on the bike in written
loccitane got some bonbons over the top
there how cute is that just so adorable
I'm so excited to eat it and I've just
noticed that the roof is sparkly as well
and there was a press release within it
that says if I tweet or Instagram a
photo using hashtag giving back at
Christmas then they will make a 25-pound
donation on my behalf to the locks tan
foundation or a charity of my choice and
the lock Stern foundation was created in
2006 and helps improve every community
in which they operate helping people
that are blind or people that have
severe citing issues so the money will
be going towards that i'm not sure if
there's any way for you guys to get
involved and i'll leave a link to the
lock stand foundation down below I just
thought that leather when brands do
tragical things because I mean the
beauty industry can be a little shallow
sometimes it's just beauty products so I
find it so lovely when brands have a
little bit more substance to them and do
terrible things like this so thank you
lots turn if you're watching I'm so
excited to eat this but at the same time
it's almost too beautiful to eat so hmm
problems
just about ready to go now my hair is
just not playing balls have had to
scrape that back into a ponytail again
makeup-wise my makeup is ninety-nine
point nine percent old Tom Ford I spent
the morning with Vicky whose face just
looked flawless and she was wearing Tom
Ford so I've used their tracers
foundation stick I've used their shade
and illuminate contour and highlight a
little bit and he's that I shadow I've
got their lipstick on I will leave links
to the exact ones down below to unfold
mascara so yeah pretty ton folded up
makeup wise and I think I quite like it
I haven't done my makeup this heavy for
quite some time but um felt that it was
appropriate for tonight so i'm going to
show you my outfit of the day quite
quickly i feel that i'm actually not
doing so well when it comes to evening
outfits for the winter i need to do a
little bit of shopping and but yeah well
i'm wearing tonight is top and trousers
both from Topshop and now i'm wearing my
Valentino shoes and my bvlgari handbag
so this is the full look really hard to
show kicks is so much stuff in the way
of my mirror but yeah it's a high neck
top from Topshop this bag I just still
can't go over its beauty and then wide
leg trousers which our topshop ones and
then I've got my Valentino shoes which
you can just see underneath so I need to
let Dexter out for a we get some food
for him and then we're ready
Oh
39
wait
go to get stuff
home again I feel like I haven't
actually vlogs that much there haven't
got too much footage to show you guys
cuz I've been dashing around here there
and everywhere but had a really good
time at the mr. Porter event was nice to
see all the boys know a few of my
favorite girls there as well so it's
really lovely evening I think Chaz had a
good time with all your lad pals did you

day at quarter past ten I'm just gonna
