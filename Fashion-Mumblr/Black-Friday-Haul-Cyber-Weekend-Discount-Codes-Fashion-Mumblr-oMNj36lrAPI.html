channel you're getting a bonus video
from me today outside of my usual upload
schedule because this weekend is not
just any weekend
it is Cyber weekend and unless you have
been on another planet for the past few
days you'll probably know that yesterday
was one of the biggest shopping days in
the whole year it was Black Friday and I
don't know about you but I picked up
quite a few bargains yesterday I prefer
to do most of my shopping online these
days especially on days such as Black
Friday because the high street is just
absolutely crazy it's like trying to
elbow your way through I don't know just
so many people on Oxford Street in
particular which is my closest shopping
destination so I did all of my Black
Friday shopping online I actually wrote
a blog post which I will leave linked
down below which if you two want to do
your cyber weekend shopping online it
should come in really really handy
because I actually wrote down all of my
favorite retailers that are doing
incredible discounts over cyber weekend
and I also put in all of the discount
codes that you need including some
secret VIP discount code so not ones
you'd find on the website so if you are
feeling kind you could also share the
blog post with your friends and family
and help them take a few things of their
Christmas wish lists so without further
ado I'm going to go through a few of
things which I picked up on Black Friday
and a lot of the retailers and I'm going
to be talking through our continuing at
their sales throughout cyber weekend so
you can still pick up some bargains
right up until midnight on Monday the
28th of November and so hopefully these
things won't have sold out by the time
you guys watch this I'm going to get
started with fashion and then I'm going
to go through a few beauty bargains
which I've picked up and then finally a
few home web pieces and some gift ideas
if you've got anybody left on your
Christmas list to shop for first of all
is a retailer which you guys may not
have heard of I actually have heard of
them until recently but when I heard
about their Black Friday sale I thought
it was a perfect opportunity to give
their clothing a try and it's actually
an American website called chic wish and
I found out about it on Instagram
because they basically have all the
clothes that all the like Instagram
girls wear with the big ruffle sleeves
and the beautiful lace collars things
that look a lot more designer than they
actually are so I think they had 20% off
but I'm going to leave the current cyber
weekend discounts because sometimes the
sales value goes up there the cyber
weekend so the latest sale discounts
will be in the description box so make
sure you check that out as well as links
to all the products I mentioned but I
picked up firstly this blouse it is a
lace blouse it's quite sure at the top
but then it's got some lining in the
boob area so you're not too flashing a
hum but it also has beautiful ruffles
down the sleeves and I don't know what
you guys are thinking but when I saw
this I thought self-portrait and let me
tell you it was a fraction of the price
of a self-portrait top but it looks so
beautiful and high-end no one would
believe you if you told them it wasn't
self-portrait but I thought it was a
great opportunity to pick this up with
the additional discount so I got that
and then as you may know I'm rather
obsessed with my Club Monaco jungle
which has the big ruffle sleeves but I
still save it for my best and I saw this
one which is very very similar as you
can see it also has the ruffle sleeves
but it's a little bit more casual
because it has more of a chunky knit
design this lighting is not really doing
it any favors but if I do have a photo
of me wearing it because I did take some
today I'll leave it on the screen here
but yeah it has this fabulous
ruffle sleeve detail which is so in
fashion at the moment but it was a
fraction of the price of my Club Monaco
one so I'll be getting a lot of use out
of this one I also picked up a gray
skirt and white top combination again if
I have the photo I'll put it here
and because I've put them in the wash
because I was wearing them today but
that outfit just looks so chic and it
really is that typical Instagrammer
style which I obviously love and they
were on a really good discount today so
pick those up
and then from these super affordable to
something a little bit more premium I
also wanted to show you my new Yaeger
coach because Yaeger are also in sale
over that cyber weekend and this has
quickly become a staple in my autumn
winter wardrobe this is just a very
classic camel coat it's very long it's
wool so it's super warm and it just is a
very classic finishing touch to a lot of
autumn winter outfits Jagr are 20% off
this weekend it may be changing
throughout the weekend so once again
I'll leave updated links down below but
this is just such a classic style and
the kind of thing that will never really
go out of fashion so even if you put it
away in the loft after this winter you
can get it out every winter for the next
few years and get so much use out of
something like this so it really is a
classic investment piece so watch out
cuz you'll be seeing this a lot on the
Instagram you have been warned it's
going to be one of those for curring
pieces one of my favorite retailers that
went into sale / cyber weekend was River
Island
they went into sale and I think it was
20% off the whole site and I picked up
this shearling jacket which I've had my
eye on for quite some time it's got a
leather effect in color and then this
ceiling with sheep's wool although
obviously not real sheep's wool on the
outside and this is kind of thing that's
very cool girl very East London which is
not hugely my style but I thought as
it's such a good discount I'll give it a
try and see if I can pull it off so
hopefully I'll be able to rock this
maybe with some leather trousers or with
some jeans and over knee boots I think
I'd be a really cool look so this would
usually be 85 pounds which is quite
pricey so the discount really did make a
big difference to me buying this one so
I picked up that but also some more meal
type shoes because I can't resist them I
absolutely love meals enough by far
being my go-to shoe type over the autumn
winter season and I don't see that
ending anytime soon these are a pinky
metallic almost a rose gold hue and as
I'm sure you are thinking they look
very similar to the Gucci style so I'll
definitely be wearing these as a Gupta
tube over the next few weeks until it's
too cold for me to wear many more and
then quite possibly the mother of all
Black Friday sales and continuing
throughout the weekend
of course misguided can we just talk
about misguided sale 50% off everything
so naturally I went a little bit Craig I
picked up a pink Roy code I know you're
thinking Josie you don't need another
coat but it's pink and furry so I
couldn't resist it I just think this is
going to be so snuggly it's going to be
one of those coats that if I'm dashing
across the road and I just want to be
warm it's basically like wearing your
dressing-gown out in public and it being
a little bit more acceptable than we're
addressing y'all in public so this up
misguided never put the prices on the
labels which is really annoying when I'm
trying to tell you on that place vent
but as I mentioned links down below you
can check it out but 50% off at this bad
boy and it is just so snuggly I look
like a giant marshmallow but I don't
care because it is so soft and I just
love it love it blow it like something a
little bit more wearable although still
rather cray-cray is this dress from
misguided
yes misguided got this 40% off and how
much does this look like a bomb on dress
I just think it looks so high-end it's
covered in this beautiful embellishment
it's got almost like a grid detail
across the chest area with these mini
pearls big pearls gold studs and once
again this was just such a good price
point for something that looks really
really high-end it's the kind of thing
that will be a bit of a classic in your
wardrobe for Christmas parties and black
tights maybe some gold shoes and I don't
know if you can see in the video but it
really does catch the light and it's not
sparkly it's just embellished it's very
flattering it's got this like waist bone
detail so are we getting a lot of wear
out of this and such a good price point
from misguided as well other retailers
that are doing amazing sale
over the weekend include of course a
sauce I actually don't have an ace
hospital for you for the first time in
probably my entire life although there
are plenty on my channel to choose from
but a sauce did 20% off on Black Friday
with a code which was go-go-go and I'm
presuming that that's going to continue
until the end of Monday
who else Bowden did an amazing sale they
did 40% off all the full priced items
and if you've been reading my blog
recently you'll know that I've been
picking up quite a few bits and bobs
from Bowden another favorite of mine
during this time of year is jewels and
jewels have got loads of different sales
up to 50% off and actually I have my
jewels boots with me so these ones you
might have spotted in my autumn way to
look but these are on sale over cyber
weekend and I also have my own discount
code for jewels which is Josie 20 so you
can add that on to your Black Friday
discounts to pick up a bargain from them
both the jewels and version also have
some really lovely menswear I know
charlie is a big fan of both Jules and
Bowden and has been treating himself to
a few bets over cyber weekend as well
I'll leave Charlie's Instagram links
down below so if you have any men in
your life that you would like to treat
or if you're a guy I mean not all my
views girls bio leavers Instagram down
below for a little bit of a boy
inspiration Karen Millen
can we just talk about Karen Millen
because they had 25% off everything on
their website or at least full price
things and I believe that that's also
carrying on throughout cyber weekend my
gray coat and my brownie orange suede
boots which you guys absolutely loved in
my autumn lookbook they are discounted
right now and Karen Millen is a bit of a
premium brand investment pieces so that
discount really does make such a
difference and they're classic pieces
they're not gonna be going out of style
any time soon
so it's a really good time to invest in
those more longer-lasting
timeless pieces and yeah 25 cent off
really does make it
at those price points let me see
sweaty Betty they had 20% off and they
continued to have 20% off over the
weekend and I'll leave a vlog post link
down below with my recent sweaty Betty
purchases because I have been wearing
them a lot for outdoor exercise recently
and also another favorite of mine
moniker vinegar they have got 30% of all
their full price jewelry when you sign
up to their mailing list so if you are a
fan of the rings that I always wear the
bracelets and I'm wearing all the time
they are from my cabin in dirt and yeah
you can get those 30% off but as I
mentioned all of these discount codes
are in one handy blog post so make sure
you check that out next I'm going to
very quickly go through a few of my
beauty favorites the one that stands out
to me is look fantastic they really are
my go-to website for beauty products and
I picked up a couple of pieces in the
Black Friday discount this one is the
shantak item to moisturizer this is a
very price certain to moisturizer but
bloggers are always telling me that I
need to try this so I think it's 58
pounds on its full price but I got it at
44 pounds in the sale so really looking
forward to giving this a try and at such
a good price compared to its full price
it is quite an investment so I thought I
might as well make the most of the sale
and also it's stocking up on benefit
roller lash
they had 25% off a huge variety of
pieces on their website and like Friday
and continuing until Monday midnight so
I picked up something that I was in
desperate need of a topic with which is
benefit roller lash in my ASOS wishes
basket I've had a few pieces from bando
and I was actually planning on buying
them in the ASOS side weekend sale but I
did a little bit of research and I found
that bando themselves had 25% off so I
picked up their power bank this is a
mobile phone charger which is basically
an essential for bloggers anybody that
is obsessed with their phone that needs
it for work and is Instagram and
snapchat in the whole time we all
phones are like when it comes to battery
power pretty darn crap so I thought this
is a really really useful thing to buy
I'm actually regretting not buying more
because I think they make a really good
stocking fillers so this was 25% off and
can we get it out the trust they can
actually show you properly so it says
charge multiple devices on the girth
compatible with iPhone iPad Android
tablets through USB blah blah blah you
guys know how these work it says I am
very busy it's pink it's fairly light
and by the looks of the fact that it's
got four dots and it makes me think
it'll charge your phone four times I
think that's how it works
but as seriously handy want to get and
yeah 25% off and I also picked up from
them and a calendar because it's games
that time of year where we need to think
about our 20:17 calendars once again
these make really good stocking fillers
and this one says best year ever which
is a nice optimistic message and it's
got some really cute patterns or like
month sketches on the back so picked up
those two from bando but as well as that
ASOS has loads of really good gift ideas
on their website 20% off and actually in
another blog post I did a roundup of my
a sauce Black Friday edits so I picked
out all my favorite things from a sauce
which I said at the moment so having a
look at that basically just keep an eye
on my vlog because I'm continually
updating that and every time I see
something really amazing that I feel is
going to sell out soon I also tweet it
so make sure you follow my Twitter as
well which is at fashion mumbler I will
continue to share my favorites across
all my social channels so stay tuned but
that is all from me for now I hope you

the end of it like the way that I'm
having at the moment but thank you so
