Charlie and I have just finished the gym
so really good start to the day and I'm
really out of breath because I'm pearl
walking to my friend Vicky's house Vicky
you guys have seen her reform vlogs
she has just moved in like a half-hour
walk from me so so just on my way to go
and see her now al I thought I'd start
the blog here because it's their wedding
and yeah we live in London so it's um
quite rare that we actually get proper
snow here luckily I've just for the
weather got my Topshop Park on and my
Amy roots not sure if you saw those so
yeah today just gonna go and see Vicky
she's it literally just moved in so I'm
gonna help her unpack and buy some house
bits and then I think we're gonna go and
have breakfast we were gonna go for a
walk but I might say challenges far too
knackered because I did loads of cardio
in the gym this morning as well and as
you can hear I'm really out of breath so
know what sure I can manage another walk
and then I think we're gonna get a
breakfast and then maybe go into town
and buy some new house before
so just got back home and have been to
Dajjal picked up some post and I got
some lovely bits I thought he very
quickly show you because me and Charlie
about to go out Vicky's downstairs and
I'm gonna help her take some stuff back
to her house now so I've got a few bits
and bobs from estée lauder which is
lovely I got their advanced Night Repair
Serum and also I think this is a new
ones I haven't heard of it before night
web plus three-minute mask and also I
really wanted and I'm asked for the
flight on Thursday and I saw no pupils
and snapchats that two-faced we're doing
a send out so I've got the two-faced one
which is really cute it's got a gold
sparkly hangover score dye mask and
typical so I've gone from having no eye
masks to having to because Estee Lauder
also put a beautiful silk Olivia Hogg
who won in with their night products and
it's is so gorgeous it's so soft I raved
about my aliyev on her pajamas which I
got from the currents Christmas thing
and this is going to merge them and we
can take this on the flight with me so
it love it and hangover hangover to face
before they sent their honey or primer
which I have already I love so wonderful
Patrol
my mother is getting some help with the
drug possession
yeah hidden doing more than helping
neighbor boy
morning guys it's Monday morning now and
back to work as usual I've just been to
the gym got back and washed my hair and
now I'm gonna crack on with some work
Charlie and I are thinking about
redecorating the lounge this room here
so first of all I'm going to look at a
few wallpaper samples and also try and
plan some painting so we're basically
gonna paint this whole room which is
like patio doors fireplace which we
might put wallpaper on and TV unit area
so I'm going to look at some paint
styles now I think I'm pretty gonna go
quite plain but Dulux have said that I
can try out this new amazing space
platform that there that I launched in
which i think is where you upload photos
of your room and then they get like a
designer's have a look at it and
recommend some stuff so there's that I
can try it out for free so I'm going to
give that a little go
hopefully they might give me some ideas
and then we're also going to paint the
hallway down here we've actually got
some marks on the ceiling from where our
bath leaked one year so that means to be
covered and then through here down the
hallway our stairs and we've got like a
brown color up the stairs the moment was
lil bit gross so I think we're gonna get
that updated dunno I just picked Dexter
up from the bed and bring him downstairs
and I know it's a little bit gross I
actually heard him heart I just so funny
because he's so cute and so tiny nose
dorable it like noise and oh my god I
know it's gross it was so cute a little
bit smelly but oh I think that you know
you're um a little bit crazy feeldog
when you find even their farts cute
anyway let's um let's have a look at
this website and plan some painting so
I've just completed this kind of survey
on the website on the Dulux amazing
spaces website and it's asked me a few
of my preferences like what kind of
rooms I like what kind of colors I like
and
now it's asking me to take some photos
so I think I'm just going to do this on
my phone and I've got to upload it to
the website so it says to include any
particular features so that at least
gets the fireplace and the shelves in so
I've created a Pinterest board with lots
of lounge stars I like the look of and
I've added a link back into the website
and made an appointment so I will be
chatting to one of their people tomorrow
night at 8 o'clock so I'll let you know
how I get on I'm now going to try and
attempt to tidy my bedroom which is a
bit of a bomb site at the moment because
I've got a load of summer clothes down
from the loft ready for Thursday's
little trip so I'm gonna quickly try and
decide which ones are going to come with
me and stick them in my humongous
doesn't look that big but actually it's
pretty much the size of me suitcase and
got some posts which I just haven't
tidied up yet so yeah gonna have a bit
of Tidy session so I can use this bed
for some filming because I need to film
like three videos later space so let's
get cracking okay so I've just finished
setting up my bedroom ready for filming
changed my top because the jumper don't
really go with the video that I'm
filming looking at myself here I think I
definitely need some more powder and
that yeah so the room is now a little
bit more tidy got my lights on my tripod
set up and this is all the products I'm
going to be talking about I'm going to
do an in-flight beauty routine video and
I might also try and film parts of it on
the flight on Thursday because I'm
actually going business class which I've
never done before and which is amazing
I'm really excited so I thought I'd make
the most and maybe do a little bit
filming on the plane but that's probably
a little bit optimistic but so I've got
all the products lined up down there for
the video and lights and everything set
up it's quarter past coming and CY
watches around could fast three now and
I need to be in central London for just
after 6:00 and I did want to film two
possibly three videos so I'm gonna get
cracking
wish me luck and I'll see you afterwards
I already saw I've changed completely
since I last saw you as you can
I finished filming I've packed
everything away which is wonderful and
I'm about to go out into town now there
is a travel media event going like the
Hard Rock Cafe so I've just had a little
bit of food because Hard Rock Cafe food
I can't resist it on an empty belly you
can sit here yeah hopefully I've got to
resist in that a little bit more full my
outfit I promise you is not completely
ninja black let me show you what I'm
wearing so I've got a black roll neck on
and a furry juillet she can kind of see
that which is from Topshop and the
juillet she'll is from Topshop top is
from Jeff Perkins this little skirt is
from Topshop necklace is from an
American store actually in Texas and
then my boots are my Russell and Bromley
Highline boots and then I'm going to
take with me this handbag which is my
deep of a Chloe fave and I'll leave the
link for this down below something I've
linked it on the video yet so yeah this
is the full look and I'm gonna go now
yo
Oh
other people Russell a basic idea seemed
really into the idea
I don't want to get my hopes up so I'm
just thinking right now and the morning
morning guys it's Tuesday morning and
Charlie and I have just been for an
early morning gym workout I'm determined
to get as many gym sessions in as
possible before I fly on Thursday so
hopefully I'll get another one in
tomorrow but I have got a day full of
meetings so we'll see just made a nice
breakfast smoothie which I was kind of
hoping was going to turn up Pink's I
could take some photos but it turned out
Brown so yeah just gonna drink this one
I'm not sure on social media okay so I
finished my smoothie and I'm gonna get
cracking with the day now it's really
really good lighting it's a nice blue
skies so well it would have been perfect
to do the outfit photos would show that
I was planning on doing the closed-in
arrived yet so I can't do that so I'm
gonna hop in the shower really quickly
and then I might do some more filming
because there's a couple more videos I
need to do before I go away so I can
schedule them for while I'm in Costa
Rica so I'm going to do that and also
thought I might do a blog post on what's
in my carry-on or something like that so
quick shower then I'm going to make the
most of the light and do some photos I
can't actually remember what the last
thing I was doing when I picked up the

finished filming I have successfully
done it to videos of course I've changed

any of their products before so we were
just introduced to all the hero products
which I kind of flashed up on the screen

taxi home at half seven and try and rush
to my dawdle before it shuts at 8:00
through all the London traffic and
because basically I have some Sun cream
from his plane which I obviously have to
take with me on the trip tomorrow
because it's a piss win trip and also
loads of holiday codes or holiday
workshop clothes which I'd ordered from
ASOS Topshop new look next yes like
problem but we made it in time really
red skin of our teeth
and I've my driver Jarvis who is one of
the drivers from Sanderson was the best
driver in the whole world so if anyone
from the sunson is watching give that
man a raise because oh my god he was
like got me there perfectly on time and
he was just so lovely help me carry
everything to the door I was being so
demanding I was like I need to go to the
bathroom please pull over here or can I
