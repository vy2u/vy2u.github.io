joining me for today's video today's
video is going to be something a little
bit different it's something that really
I just kind of decided to do quite
last-minute because I decided to treat
myself to a few new techie bits and bobs
mostly from Alison and I thought I would
do a youtube and blogger tech haul video
because I know that quite a lot of my
viewers and also blog readers are
bloggers themselves or they're just
really interested in photography so if
that sounds like you then this video
hopefully be really useful for you and I
thought instead of it just being like an
unboxing I have a massive Amazon box to
my left I thought I would also use this
opportunity to let you know what
equipment that I use and I've got about
4 cameras I thought would be interesting
to go through what cameras are used for
what type of content and also the little
gadgets that I've picked up along the
way that make my blogging and youtube
life a little bit easier so if you are a
blogger or youtuber or you're interested
in photography then yeah hopefully this
would be really interesting for you I
should say I'm not a professional
photographer I'm not a professional
videographer I've only been doing
youtube for a year so I'm not an expert
but I think I quite enjoy watching this
type of videos so hopefully it will be
of interest to you before I open the box
I think logistically it would make more
sense for me to talk about what I use
now how I find it so if you just wanted
to see the unboxing of the new stuff
I'll leave like a em I don't know what
they're called when you have like the
time I'll leave the time point down
below so you can skip the unboxing if
that's where you're interested in but
first I'm going to go through what I
currently use in a tie my hair up
because I'm having a bad hair day and
it's annoy me okay I feel much better
now and ready to get down to business
now that I've got my hair tied up so I'm
going to start with a camera that I'm
filming this on because that's the
camera that I get the most questions
about watching from YouTube videos on so
I'm going to start with that one and but
to talk about it I'm going to use my
vlogging camera which I will talk about
shortly so I'm going to switch over to
this camera to let you guys know about
that okay so this is my current filming
setup got the window I've got the
curtains wide open natural daylight and
this here is a camera they fill my
YouTube
goes on so it is the canon eos 600d and
i just flip the screen out i don't
currently use any microphones and it's
fairly easy to use i just have it on the
video setting and I have got the 40 mil
lens which I find really good for
creating that blurry background and to
get that camera to work I use a remote
so this has two flips on the back and
it's basically photo mode or video mode
so that's how I get the camera starting
so I sit down on the bed and I click
record so that's the camera that I'm
currently using to film my youtube
videos and to film at that section I
used this which is my canon g7x mark ii
i did originally have the mark 1 but I
have microphone problems with that one
so I waited to the mark 2 this is a
really good vlogging camera I know a lot
of youtubers also use this for vlogging
and the reason why it's so great is
firstly because it's tiny
I love the olympus pen when it's pretty
big fairly heavy and which makes it not
ideal for vlogging especially if you do
have a smaller handbag or you just don't
to be carrying so much around with you
the screen on this one flips up which
personally I find really unflattering so
I just hold the camera upside down so
that the lens is underneath and that way
I don't get my bags when I'm vlogging
quality wise I find this camera really
good I find that low level lighting it
performs better than the olympus pen and
but there are many upsides to the
olympus pen which i will go through
shortly so yeah this is what I can't
leave lagann I don't really do that much
else with this camera only vlogging and
for that purpose it serves me really
really well onto the pen and I feel like
I could film a whole video just about
the olympus pen is truly a fabulous
camera is the bloggers favourite for so
many reasons mainly because it's just so
easy to take incredible photos
especially when it comes to outfit
photos this lens here which is the 45
mil lens is every bloggers best friend
and also i use it for shooting lookbook
videos so if you've seen any of my
videos where i'm in a foreign country
and actually even in the UK my lookbook
videos are neo is filmed on your livers
pen with the for travel lens because
it's so portable going out in the
evenings i don't want to carry
massive camera around with me this one's
beautiful with a shoulder strap it's
just so so easy to carry it is
lightweight as well not as lightweight
actually
weight wise they're not that different
it's just this little bit bigger I use
this on the manual mode for taking blog
photos or I use it on video mode for
taking videos so when it comes to
shooting really high quality video on
the go this is really really fat but
because the screen flips down on this
one it's not so convenient to attach to
my paraquad but otherwise I probably
would film my videos at home on this as
well only major downside to the Olympus
PEN for me is how it performs in low
level lighting and when I picked up the
g7x that was the thing that really made
me make the jump from vlogging on this
to vlogging on the g7x
if you just want to buy one camera to
really kickstart your youtube channel if
you want to be vlogging if you want to
take some really good videos when out
and about you cannot beat the olympus
pen and if you want to take beautiful
outfit photos if you don't have a
youtube channel but just have a blog
then the olympus pen and the 45 ml lens
will be your best friend because it's so
easy to take those point-and-shoot
blurry background photos you don't need
to be a professional photographer you
don't really need to be good at
photography I trained Charlie to do it
with him maybe like a week and he was
taking really good photos I'll leave
some examples on the screen now which
that Charlie has taken he's not a
photographer literally point focus and
take the photo and you're done and you
get beautiful beautiful blurry
background photos with the 45 mil lens I
am actually getting some new lenses soon
to really vamp up my vamp up and pop my
blog photos particularly the 75 mil lens
so once I've got that if you'd like to
know a little bit more about that then
let me know and maybe I'll do another
video just about the olympus pen because
as i said there is a lot to know about
this camera i know a lot of bloggers
either have got it or interested in it
so if you'd like to know more about the
olympus pen then let me know in the
comments and maybe I will do a pen that
specific video next we have the most
recent addition to my camera family and
this is the canon eos 6d and I am
decided to invest in this because I
really wanted to improve I blog for
table
my videography on a very high quality
scale so I picked up the Sigma 35 mil
lens and to be honest I haven't actually
used it that much recently I'm
determined to really understand how this
camera works to learn all the different
settings but I just haven't really had
time to sit down and work it yet
so this camera I've had it for about two
weeks now and how really used it so I
can't talk too much about this but what
I do know is that also when I put the 40
mil lens on which is currently on that
camera and it takes stunning stunning
photos so hopefully you'll see an
increase in quality in my blog photos
and YouTube videos very soon thanks to
this bad boy next onto accessories and
things that I find make my YouTube life
a little bit easier I already mentioned
this which is a remote and it basically
means that I can zap my camera on and
off while I'm sitting away from it
without having to lean in and fill it
with any dials I do want to get to a
stage where I have a cord going from my
camera to my laptop and I know it's
really easy I just I don't really have
any way to put my laptop and I don't
mind talking to the screen so for me the
remote works really well and I think
these are about $4.99 on ebay so really
really cheap to pick up I suggest
getting four or five because I do lose
these quite frequently next I have a
mini gorilla pod and this is actually
little not strong enough to hold my SLR
camera especially in 600d I haven't
actually tried it with my 60 but I'm
sure it would probably be okay and this
is incredibly useful for traveling
because obviously it bends round so you
can clip your camera onto chair backs or
bed frames or whatever you want to wrap
it around and it will support your
camera at any angle so perfect for
taking videos or even photos when you
are traveling for me I've used this so
many times since I bought it I think
it's about 15 pounds so that was a
really really good investment I also
recommend getting a few pouches and I
find these really useful for storing my
cameras
I store my g7x in here when I'm hanging
around in the day but also store your
lenses so this is my Olympus pancake
lens when I vlog on the Olympus I use
this and it's a very good quality lens
you do still get that beautiful depth of
field but not
as intense obviously as a 45 ml lens
definitely make sure you don't lose the
backs of your lenses because any dust
gets in the back here and your lens is
not going to be taking as sharp photos
and also make sure you are careful with
your lens covers I'm actually fairly
surprised that this lens cover has
survived because I've gone through so
many on the Olympus and you'll notice on
this lens I actually have an automatic
lens cover which was a really really
good investment I think it was only
about fourteen pounds from Amazon but it
screws on and off and basically it
automatically opens and closes as you
turn the camera on which means I don't
lose my lens cap when I'm vlogging on
the Olympus pancake lens then the last
couple of bits and bobs I've got in this
bag are a couple of spare batteries I've
got a spare for my g7 X and a spare for
the Olympus PEN and these have come in
handy so many times the worst thing in
the world is if you're out logging for
the day or filming a lookbook and your
battery dies so it's always worth buying
a few spare batteries for every camera
really whether that's for your big ones
so that when you're filming a video the
battery dies you can have a spell when
charging there's nothing worse than
having to pause your video and waiting
in two hours for your battery to charge
so definitely pick up a few spare
batteries and keep them in the pouch
that goes in your handbag just so that
you'll never court without any charge so
that's the equipment that I currently
use for my blogging and my youtube
channel if you would like further
information on any of the cameras then I
actually wrote a blog post on this topic
a little while ago I don't think it
includes the g7x or the 60 if you want
to know more about this camera I'm
filming on and also my Olympus PEN I did
write a blog post with more details and
I will leave a link to that one it down
below but let's now have a look at what
I've decided to invest in before I get
started I'll let you know about my
lighting setup so in the winter months
where it's really dull and I don't have
days like today when I can film a
natural daylight I use two softbox
lights and I think you can pick up to
about 30 to 50 pounds on Amazon I just
pretty much got the cheapest ones that
are available and they're great they
work really well they illuminate the
background and you in a flattering way
but they are frickin massive and when I
say massive I mean this room is taken
over
by the two softbox and if I decide to
film downstairs it just takes over the
whole lounge so as soon as we started
getting a few sunny days where I could
film in natural daylight like today I
put them up in the loft and I'm just so
grateful to have the space back in my
room I'd say the videos I filmed for the
past four months have all been done in
natural daylight this video is being
filmed in natural daylight sometimes I
tweak the lighting a little bit in
iMovie and but usually not so much I do
increase the brightness on my camera
just to make the room a little bit
brighter but as you can see even from
right now and when it's cloudy it does
change the light settings the sun's
about to come out so you'll see a really
good example of that which is why I
decided to invest in some new lighting
and also a few new gadgets for my
filming so let's get started oh this is
the box it's fairly ginormous I'm going
to open this really carefully so I'm
just going to pop it down in front of me
probably should have got some better
scissors for my nail scissors but hey ho
okay first of all there is a pack of two
batteries for this camera so as I
mentioned earlier having spare batteries
for the camera that you film on is so
important if you don't want to be
waiting around for that battery to
charge up because when you fill a video
it pretty much uses the entire battery
and if you want to fill them
back-to-back
which is really good for saving time
then you're going to need some spare
batteries so I ordered two new ones
because I did actually recently lose my
spare battery which has caused a lot of
aggro so I've got two news fare
batteries my 600d by the way in case it
is useful I will leave links to all the
items I bought down below as well as all
my cameras and bits and bobs so all the
links to everything I've mentioned will
be down below the next thing that I've
decided to treat myself to is a proper
microphone so recently I've been doing a
few more voiceovers and how I usually do
that is I film a video and then I edit
the video and then I record myself
talking on my g7x and the quality is not
that great so I decided to invest in one
of these which I can plug into this
camera while I'm filming and also plug
into my laptop to film voiceovers so
this is the video mic go light
on camera microphone and hopefully you
will notice a really good improvement in
my sound quality the main thing in this
box is this so I finally decided to get
a ring light I've actually heard
arguments for and against getting a ring
light but um I decide that I wanted to
give it a try and I found this one for
70 pounds so not cheap by any means but
I really felt that for my summer videos
especially they take up so much less
room than a softbox
so this is the ring light packaging
let's open it up and have a look okay so
first of all it has come in this black
carry case which i think will be very
very useful if I happen to go on a trip
where I know I'm going to be filming
this is actually fairly portable I mean
it is big but if I've got a luggage
allowance that's fairly generous then
this might be worth taking with me so
you can never rely on the lighting in
hotel rooms
it says the brand name on it I'd
forgotten but it's called newer so if
it's good then um yeah that's round that
it is so here it is it's fairly big
compared to my face it's actually rather
ginormous there were a few different
sizes and but this one's seem to be the
most popular one so picked up this size
again I'll leave all the information
down below cannot remember the
millimeters off the top of my head and
but yeah so this section down here is
where attaches to my tripod there's got
the LED light going all the way around
with some reflective material in there
it's very lightweight but it does feel
good quality so let me just lastly show
you the other accessories to go with
this that I also bought and then we can
try it out so on Amazon it tells you
what people that bought that also bought
and a lot of people picked up this which
is called the newer mini ball head with
Locke and hot shoe adapter and I think
you need this adapter to plug the ring
light into my tripod so I will save this
for when I'm attaching it but I also
decided to pick up this which is a
fabric diffuser so hopefully this is
going to make the lighting from the
light a lot more flattering again I'll
open
it up and do some before and after so
I'm going to try a touch missed my
tripod now and I'm going to flip over to
my vlogging camera so that I can show
you how to do it okay so this is what my
tripod looks like excuse the mess in the
background that's what bloggers behind
the scenes pretty much always looks like
and so I'm not sure I have if I have to
remove this top section in order to fit
the ring light on I think maybe I need
to unscrew this so the ring light just
flops on top okay so after looking at a
few different instructions it looks like
my tripod is only suitable for cameras
are not for lighting so I'm going to go
into the loft and get the stands for my
massive soft boxes and see if I can
attach the ring light to those instead
so this is what the top of my softbox
light looks like and I feel like this is
going to slot into there much better so
let's try again using my softbox tripod
that was really easy I just put the top
of the tripod into the bottom of the
light and then it tightened both of
these nozzles so I screwed them both
kind of like towards each other to
tighten them now let's extend it and see
if I can attach my camera inside this is
how we're looking so far after a couple
minutes of faffing so this is the bit
that I was saying it came as the
recommended bit from Amazon let's try
and focus there we go yeah so this is
the bit I'll leave what it's called on
the screen now that was recommended from
Amazon but weirdly it doesn't seem to
fit fully into here so this is obviously
some tracks where the bottom of this
gadget which screws into the camera is
meant to slide all the way forward but
I've tried loads of different angles and
it is just not sliding forward the
bottom bit is just too big to slide all
the way in which means that any knocks
and my camera is going to go flying
backwards so I need to try to put some
like wd-40 on it or something or
attentively find a new one so I will
keep you guys updated as to the solution
check the description box and if I do
find a solution I'll put a little memo
down there but for now I would just show
you what it does so basically the bottom
of the camera wouldn't be able to slot
in here anyway so you need to get some
kind of adapt
and this one has a flexible ball on it
which means I can alter the angle of my
camera can't redo it very well one
handedly but you can tilt the camera
down tilt it side to side which gives
you greater flexibility with your camera
when you're filming
you've got the electricity connector for
the light down here so I'm going to plug
it in and then we can see what it looks
like so the on and off buttons are here
I've got it switched on now and there's
the on/off switch so actually it's weird
they actually seem to be the wrong way
around so I'm going to switch it to the
off position which is actually the on
position and you can see it started to
light up the bedroom over there and then
you've got a dimmer switch but I'll show
you in a second it's incredibly subtle
I'm sorry about the blurriness by the
way this camera's focus on the g7x is
really off recently there we go so you
can see the dimmer switch although let
me show you now it's really really
subtle brightest dullest and effect on
the background dull bright very very
subtle and now the all-important let's
see how it looks for my videos okay so
the ring light is now on and switched on
so I be interested to see what it looks
like in the big screen if there's much
difference because to be honest in my
tiny screen of these 600d I cannot see
much difference
I started it off on nearly the dimmest
setting so as I mentioned it's got a
dimmer switch and this is nearly the
dimmest setting so let me turn it up to
full blast and you guys can see what
that looks like it's so bright it's
almost like too dazzling for me to look
at so this is what my room and my face
looks like with it on full setting to be
perfectly honest it's too dazzling for
my eyes thankfully I've got the diffuser
so I'm going to try popping this on and
seeing what the effect is like with my
diffuser
okay I've just switched to my vlogging
camera to show you the most epic design
fail so considering that all of these
items were recommended for me to buy
together the camera does not reach
through the hole in the diffuser and the
little dangly thing on the back isn't
adjustable so I can't increase my camera
height
it's just ridiculous like that's such a
design flaw so look at this my little
camera is sitting here and the lens is
nowhere near the hole this thing is not
adjustable so I cannot raise the height
of my camera so what I'm going to have
to do from now until I find a solution
is put my camera on this and then aim it
through there not ideal I now have my
two tripods straddling each other so
that my camera is at a height that it
can see through the diffuser so this
diffuser better be worthwhile in order
for you to do this I've had to spend
quite a while filling around with the
positioning so that it doesn't get any
of the diffuser in the screen like you
can see in the top corner there so let's
see if it's worth all of this faff I'm
having to like sneak through the
diffuser to even see myself on the
screen to make sure I'm in focus so now
I can't see the screen and just thought
I could probably put the camera in front
of the diffuser and that would sort
solve all of those problems but either
way such a massive design flaw I can't
see myself now I've got no idea if I'm
focus or not or even if I'm positioned
right so that's a major major design
flaw if anyone knows if there is a
version of this which is extendable that
would probably make my life a lot easier
and then I could just plug my camera
into my laptop to be able to see myself
so that we problem solved but for now I
have the weirdest set up as you can see
on the vlogging camera I have this to
look at currently the light is a lot
softer it's not hurting or dusting my
eyes in the slightest but I do have the
very weird tripod setup but my own
comfort and also heat it's a lot cooler
than when the light was directly against
my face so perhaps I should have done a
little bit more research or perhaps I'm
trying to buy too many gadgets and
should just settle for just the light
without the
user or maybe I sneaked buy a new dongle
but for now any recommendations that you
guys have if you have a ring light and
know some solutions then please let me
know in the comments I'm going to spend
some time over the next few weeks really
going to grips with this setup and for
any future videos that I film I will
leave a little note in the description
as to what I've used whether I used to
bring light whether I use a diffuser so
hopefully they'll be useful for you guys
have you enjoyed looking through all my
new pieces with me my first ever tech
haul let me know if you like the idea
and what you think of the filming with a
lighting obviously as I think I
mentioned earlier it will be a lot more
extreme in winter I would not be able to
film without the artificial lighting in
the winter months because this room
isn't terribly well lit especially when
the daylight is very minimal so in
winter I think this is going to be a
really good asset if you'd like to see
an update video in maybe a couple of
months about how I'm getting along with
it then let me know and otherwise if you
do have any comments then all questions
then you can leave them in the comment
section down below but if you enjoy this
video then please give it a thumbs up
and subscribe if you're new to my
channel and I'll see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
