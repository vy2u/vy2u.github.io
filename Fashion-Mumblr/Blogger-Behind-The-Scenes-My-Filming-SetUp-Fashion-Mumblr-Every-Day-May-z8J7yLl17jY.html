first proper everyday May video I say
first proper because I feel like the
Copenhagen ones was more of a Copenhagen
travel diary so today is gonna be the
first proper vlog for every day mate
Charlie's just kindly made me a smoothie
what was the recipe called boom he
doesn't even know but it's kind of like
a orange slush puppies so I'm gonna give
that a go in a second it's Sunday today
the actual first day of May where is it
Monday
I don't know losing track of time and
it's a beautiful day so I'm going to
film video in a second I'm going to film
a French Connection haul because I have
bought a big load of items from there
and everything is so gorgeous and I just
thought I would share it with you so I'm
gonna film that in a second
Charlie's gonna be watching football
down here though so I'm gonna film up in
my bedroom in my old filming location
and then I think I'm going to take extra
for a nice walk and make the most of
this sunshine and then we're going to
try his parents house because it's his
little sister's birthday or it was a
couple of days ago
so today's can be quite chilled day and
in no way represents what the rest of
the month it's gonna look like because
things are gonna get a little bit crazy
I bet Dexter is sunbathing somewhere
where are your little sausage usually
he's here okay you are a little froggy
did you find a little spot in the
sunshine did you yeah if ever we lose
Dexter he's always just here sitting in
the Sun we did a bit of gardening
yesterday mum came over and helped and
it's looking pretty good
cleared out all the crap from the back
areas and actually in a few days this
whole lawn is getting ripped up and
we're getting astroturf so say farewell
to the lawn no this is my massive
collection of French Connection clothes
I need to film in a second so just need
to make this room more filming friendly
set my camera up on the tripod I think
I'll just use a natural light today
because it's so lovely so I just need to
find some flowers to put in that corner
and tidy up a little bit oh and I
thought I could he mentioned I have kind
of got a new lip combination favorite so
normally I always wear my Tom Ford
Spanish pink or no Tom Ford first time
but recently I had a meeting with the
lovely Sophie from Lancome and she kind
of gave me a new combination to try out
and I love it what I'm wearing right now
it's not too dissimilar color wise to my
normal kind of Tom Ford combination but
it's a lot more moisturizing on the lips
which is great too when you are on a
holiday so the lip liner is LeConte or
pro and it's in the shade 2-1-1 beige
rose and it's really releasing that to
the lipstick which if I open it not sure
if you can see but it's kind of balmy so
it's a really nice kind of hydrating
texture on the lips and this is number
two 1/8
lover so it's not too shiny it's not too
matte a nice combination and really
really nice and hydrating so really
loving this combination if anyone was
wondering what I've got in my lips that
is what it is the core child was made
for breakfast
that's amazing time good yummy Charlie
is now going to Instagram - breakfast
aren't you darling
indeed I am careful that's right my face
just had a lovely breakfast cooked by
Charlie he made avocado and feta on
toasted really really yummy I'm some
scrambled eggs we're just about to take
Dexter for a nice walk now stuck on my
nice super dry hoody I thought I'd
quickly show you my little setup because
while I was waiting for showing the
shower I just took some blog photos and
they came out really nicely so if I
could just show you the setup so I
always use this over bonus marble table
normally it has some flowers on it and
some candles and stuff and the PR
company they look after Narciso
Rodriguez fragrances sent a box of the
perfume and these pom-poms so I just use
the pom-poms for later blog photos and
they look really lovely I'll show you a
couple of the photos little sneak peek
of some Kiko lipsticks and some Tom Ford
lipsticks which I just love
photographing
and then a skincare blog post as well so
that's coming soon
to freshen Amla calm
all righty we're back from the walk and
is now filming time I have started the
lounge up Charlie's gotten to his mom
and dad's house so thankfully I have a
lounge I don't have to go upstairs to
film I've set the lounge up for filming
I've got my camera here ready to go I've
got the lights on and I have a massive
pile of clothes behind me ready to film
so I will see you in about an hour and a
half because I'm gonna be throwing
trying clips so this could take a while
okay we're about halfway through the
video now I thought I'd quickly show you
this jumpsuits it's so nice but it's
just a little bit too long so this is
obviously from French Connection filming
French Connection haul but I just love
how its halter neck I think it's so nice
like tanning get nice tan shoulders and
then you've got this some kind of
waistband area so super super flattering
but on the legs it's just so long so I'm
not sure it's gonna work it's just so
annoying when that happens but I've got
about four more outfits to film the
cutouts off and then I'm done okay guys
I'm on a bit of a roll I've just filmed
a second video which I wasn't planning I
filmed the get to know me tag which I
will probably publish in a week or so
I've just put down the load of products
and I can't remember where I put them
I'm not taking them downstairs I need to
leave for Charlie's house in about half
an hour but I'm in a really filming mood
so I'm gonna film one more video I think
I'm gonna film my top five Holy Grail
high-end beauty products so typical
youtuber trick yesterday on sofa I've
changed my top I'm gonna grab a glass of
water so I'm a little bit less flustered
do a bit of breathing chill myself out
and film one more video before heading
off to Lodge cottage okay filming is
done outfit has changed for about the
ninth time today and I'm just now
heading out to go to Egham which is
where Chow is mom and dad live for his
sister's birthday lunch I try and do a
quick outfit of the day I'm now wearing
my River Island top which a lot of you
guys really liked when I wore it in my
spring wardrobe essentials video so I'm
wearing that top and also wearing River
Island jacket which is sadly out of
stock now my radley backpack jeans are
from American Eagle and then my Topshop
sandals which I wore all the time in
Costa Rica and throughout everyday May I
will try to put outfit links what I'm
wearing each day down in description box
because I know that it's very helpful
winds grateful winds a great part come
into Windsor Great Park for his family
and my mother looking very fetching in a
purple jacket and little conditioner
take Kings bucket
Thanks and we've just spotted two are
left as a massive hood a reindeer
reindeer day not reindeer
that's me trying to add some magical
sparkle yeah all that brown and the
horizon
that little puppy photoshoot Charlie
started obviously feeling quite
adventurous and we're now walking
straight through the deer on our way so
just got home after a long train journey
or wasn't that long and our daughter
door sat next to a bit of a nasty drunk
woman on the bus stop just waiting to
pick an argument everything that I was
saying but yeah we're home now Dex just
got a bit of a Paulie
eyes so we're going to give it a bit of
a bathe with some doggy detto
Spit weepy and you just ran out oh boy
so we're gonna give texture a bit of a
bit of a powder because I'm poor baby
and the last few pieces of my nighttime
routine
I've just been sticking some of this on
my thighs and bum I have an idea if it
works but I'm giving it a go before
holiday and then I'm currently trying
out this Lancome energy Devine meat
night cream again I've only been using
this for a few days so I will let you
know how I'm getting along with that and
last but not least my usual eye cream
which is Estee Lauder's advanced night
repair need to get another one of these
because it's almost empty so that's my
evening skin care routine so I'm gonna
go to bed now
hope you enjoyed the first proper day of
everyday May and I'll see you in the
morning right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
