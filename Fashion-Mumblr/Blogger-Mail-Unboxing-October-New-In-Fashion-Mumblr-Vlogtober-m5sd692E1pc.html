channel I hope you're having a really
lovely day today I'm feeling really
autumnal I hope you liked my little
autumnal background I've got going on
just spend a few moments pottering
around the house kind of gathering
autumnal bits and bobs so if you like my
efforts got some leaves from the garden
got some pumpkins and candles so yeah
feeling lovely and or tunnel on that
note by the way let me know if you want
any kind of or tunnel home decor videos
because I think there might be quite fun
so let me know if you want anything nice
and autumnal and your wish is my command
other ways and today's video as you may
know if you've been keeping up with vlog
Toba is a blogger mail unboxing so I
showed you in yesterday's vlog that I've
been down to the post office and picked
up quite a few bags full of pieces that
friends have sent me recently so today's
video is going to be just having a
little rummage through and seeing what
is new I probably don't need to explain
this but I know in my last vlog of mail
and boxing video there were a few
queries in the comments section so just
to clarify in case you don't know
bloggers mail is a perk of the job for
being a blogger it is when brands send
you samples or send you gifts as either
a way of saying thank you for the
coverage you've already done or here's a
product that we think you might like and
we'd love it if you would feature it on
your blog but it's not things that were
obliged to talk about it's just it is a
perk of the job because obviously a lot
of these pieces are really really lovely
and sometimes they're not even the
products from the brands they might be
just a gift that's related to the
product but don't get me wrong I'm
always really really grateful to receive
blogger mail but it is just that it is a
perk of the job as I was explaining this
to some friends the other day and they
all have different perks of their jobs
too so one of my friends got a company
car and her petrol paid for and her car
paid for so that was that was her perk
of the job and then another friend had
private health care and she got to have
a free gym membership they were their
perks Abed
whereas bloggers mail is definitely one
of my job perk so it's not something
I'll ever take for granted but it really
is a perk of the job and something
really lovely that comes with thing of
bloggers if you guys have got any
questions on how it works or things like
that then just as always leave a comment
and you guys know that I always try to
apply to all comments especially within
maybe say 12 hours of the video going
live so any questions just leave me a
comment down below and while you're in
that little area if you are new to my
channel then I would love it if you
would subscribe I've mean a lot to me
and click thumbs up if you enjoy the
video but you can leave that until the
end if you want to
so anyway I'm gonna crack on with some
blogger mail I've actually got a really
huge one on my lap this ginormous
package and I have a feeling I know what
it is I think it's a beauty advent
calendar just because of its size and
its shape so I'm just gonna go straight
on in there with this one and open it up
this is actually like opening Christmas
presents on camera or if anyone's ever
done that like open their Christmas
presents on camera they must be on
YouTube somewhere wow that is one
seriously sturdy oh good heavens
okay I can't even fit this all in the
screen but this I think I probably
started with like the best one is fairly
spectacular this is from the body shop
it says beauty lies within I'm sort of
bouncing on my knee and we've got this
beautiful gold ribbon and then inside
look at this oh oh my I can't even fit
like myself and this calendar all in one
this is beautiful I don't think I should
open it now isn't that bad luck oh I
don't know but let me have a little look
at
I can tell you a bit about it okay so
I've got the press release from the body
shop here sorry about the lighting by
the way the Sun is going in and out
nothing I can do about it it says that
this is their wildest Christmas ever and
they're doing something a little bit
different so for every Christmas gift
which I presume includes the calendar
that you buy at the body shop this year
will help protect endangered creatures
and restore one square meter of
rainforest but every single Christmas
gift for to the body shops that's a
really really impressive
it's always so lovely to hear brands
doing things like that I'm sure if you
guys watched yesterday's blog you'll
have seen about Kelly's jewelry company
that's giving a hundred percent of the
profits to the charity against poaching
elephants and this is just another
really really lovely cause so the
calendar it's also reminding forever
against animal testing Avenue condors
are back you know Jenny Carey says how
much it will be okay so three different
advent calendars and by the looks of it
they sent me the ultimate one which it
is ninety nine pounds so that is value
pricey but the goodies inside that are
worth a hundred and eighty seven so
you're getting a green tea charger
actually I don't wanna ruin it
I don't know radio for myself or for you
guys but then there's a deluxe on which
is eighty pounds or the twenty four
happy days at my panda which is sixty
pounds and these nearly always sell out
because they are full of so many amazing
products but anyway I'm probably gonna
do a video all about other calendars
later in the year so let me know if
that's something you want to see and I'm
gonna move on because I've spent a long
time getting excited over that advent
calendar next I have a black bag very
induce oops let me know too much about
what's in here by the looks of this
photo or as a press release geranium and
walnuts hand cream from Jo Malone
sounds haven't made oh I just love
German own packaging I mean could this
be any more chic it's just so beautiful
let's open it up and have a little look
oh so pretty oh my gosh German and
things just make the most perfect gifts
have a look at that such beautiful chic
packaging let's have a look take so I'm
just going to take off the metal bits on
the end so I can have a smell geranium
and walnuts I can't say that I really
own anything that has walnut as vented
but I do like to eat them ah just so
rich there's something so luxurious
about about everything that German I
make of that hand cream oh I can
definitely smell the geranium which is a
quite fresh scent considering it's
spread quite unusual choice I guess
there is something a little bit deeper
and more comforting and warming maybe
that's the walnut set but I really don't
know a walnut scent smells like but that
just instantly that's sunk in which I
absolutely hate when hand cream stick
around amagad and sticky pages so that
is absolutely lovely available from
October 2016
our RP 22 pounds so really actually it's
not terribly expensive considering as Jo
Malone so potentially a good one for the
Christmas wish list next I've got a
plastic bag I'm gonna take my schizos to
open this one up
and yes I'm aware that that is not the
correct pronunciation when I was growing
up my mum and dad decided that they
would be crazy and just pronounce things
how they were written so a lot of things
I just literally say as they are like
picture asked I say picture skew um
bald is their Baldessari of course
without ski squish yeah a few crazy
things
that my dad decided to do so we've got
lovely red and black with this one
ooh Marnie beauty long-lasting lip
magnet oh and it's matte as well okay
I'm excited to open this like a little
pass the parcel honestly these days are
like Christmas oh my good heavens look
there's so many oh my gosh I can't even
show you these properly okay so these
are lip magnet second skin intense matte
color I like the sound of this so I'm
just gonna pull out one to show you and
we can have a little swatch sorry if the
camera angle has just changed by the way
I just had to go and empty my memory
card so back to our Marnie
let's open this one up I haven't seen
what color any of them are Wow Wow
so this one in a beautiful red and kind
of plastic packaging but very
high-quality plastic and this is a
beautiful bright coral color which
normally I would reserve for summer but
I do have an exotic trip coming up so
maybe I'll take it with me on that um
opening it up and it is a heart-shaped
doe foot applicator I'm just going to
put a little bit on the back woah that
is intense color can you see that that
is like fluorescent vest material but
actually it looks quite barmy and glossy
considering it's meant to be an intense
from that so be very intrigued to try
this on my lips as soon I'm also really
excited to look through the other colors
and as per usual beauty things that I
love I will include on the blog so check
out my blog down below if you want to
see how I get along with this I will
probably have something up in a few days
depending on how well I get along with
it but yes excited to have a rummage
through the other colors which I'll
probably do on snapchat are fair filmed
this and by the way I'm throwing this
today the same day or watching it so if
you want to see more of these head over

same as my Instagram and you can have a
look at the rest of these of me gonna
Rob this in because I don't want to get
too Tommy Java wow it's actually kind of
stained my hand in the exact area where
I applied it which is a good sign so
maybe they'll be nice and long lasting
so yes excited to try those Wow
I actually have two more advent
calendars this one is from L'Occitane
and I had their calendar at last you
know it's a really really lovely one so
many products inside but yeah I'm gonna
do a other calendar video probably in
like three weeks times it's just too
early right now so I'm gonna put this to
the side and also a Clarins one and I
actually don't think I've ever had a
client's one before but I'm very excited
to try this it says beauty delights I
don't know when this is going to come
out let me have a little look quickly 95
pounds so another high-end one but I'm
sure Wow or the products inside are

I would embody this just for the
packaging oh my god I can already see
like my autumn favorite eyeshadow look
at this that is beautiful I've dropped a
brush on the floor but you know what I
never used those little eyeshadow
brushes they're just not as good as the
fluffy ones but this looks quite good

packaging so I've got some gorgeous
neutral eyeshadow shades which is just
where I work all the time and then a

bad boys look at those I'm gonna open up
this one because I'm more of a brownie
eye person than a than a cooler color
this looks like it could be very
exciting oh my gosh look at that there
is definitely a Naked palette vying
about this but as a zesty Lord I'm sure
it will just be spectacular and wow it

could not be more me all these beautiful
colors you've got a huge range of mutual
brownie or tunnel shades some warmer

a look with press reason I can tell you

and volulip okay that sounds really
interesting I'm intrigued to try that
