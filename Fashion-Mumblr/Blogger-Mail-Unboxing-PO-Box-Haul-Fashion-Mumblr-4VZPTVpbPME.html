channel and thank you so much for
joining me for today's video which is
going to be a blogger mail unboxing I
decided to do this video after and you
guys seem to really really like my last
one and or two or even three I lose
track and and yeah I did a poll on
Twitter asking what kind of video you'd
like to see now that I'm home from
America and a lot of you wanted to see a
blogger mail unboxing so I do have quite
a few really fun looking boxes
surrounding me I have to say this isn't
absolutely everything because the last
video that I filmed probably took me
about three hours and as you probably
remember it went down into part 1 and
part 2 so with the aim of keeping this
all in one video I've just kind of
cherry picks the ones that look really
exciting so hopefully they will be yes
so having said that this video still
might be quite a long one so I know they
all say that go and grab a cup of tea
probably a camel want to chill you out
I'm obsessed with chamomile tea at the
moment and yeah get comfortable grab a
dog if you got one I got Dexter here
watching me not very interested though
because he's fast asleep and I'm gonna
get started so I thought I would start
with a birch box because I absolutely
love birch box but I've never ever
opened one live on a video before I
nearly always every month open them up
on my snapchat but I don't think I've
opened one on a video before so I
thought I'd start with that I'm not sure
what the theme is this month
although first of all we have a new box
design which is like a draw
whereas normally it's like a box and
it's got a really really cute palm tree
print on it with the gold birch box so
the palm trees are making me think it
might be a bit of a holiday edit so
let's see we've got a little bottle of
the laura mercier ombre vanilla souffle
body cream and this is so handy for
traveling with hand luggage only cos
it's under 100 mil and I actually have a
full-size of this and I love it so this
is definitely gonna be coming with me
for one of my upcoming trips um what's
this one it's a brand called jelly pong
pong and I think that's a lip balm it's
called cake pop I'm sure this is a lip
balm this is what I love about Birchbox
is brands that I probably
tried before or wouldn't have picked up
necessary it's such a good opportunity
to try them and this is like a really
bright colored lip balm so I'm not gonna
open it up now just for time reasons but
I can't wait to try that and then here's
another brand I've not heard of its
called absolution creative apothecary
and this is Len Natori on to purity not
sure this is natural origin organic hmm
and apply directly to wet face oh it's a
cleanser okay
yeah another one that again I've not
heard of before so I just love trying
out new brands that's really exciting
this how I have heard of and I
absolutely love it see James Reed
overnight tan sleep mask town for the
face and I love tanning my face
overnight because can be a teeny bit
smelly although I don't think this one
is and you just wake up with a beautiful
glow so this one from James Reed I have
tried before and can confirm it's
amazing so I'm really looking forward to
trying that and then we've got a mini
hairspray from Percy and Reed again
another really really really handy one
for traveling and then at the bottom
we've got a couple of bits of stationery
what's this Birchbox paradise found
this is a cute little notebook which
tells you everything that's inside so
yeah that absolution one is a cleanse
that doesn't leave your skin feeling too
tight
Jeni Pauling at paradise pigment oh oh
it can be used on the lips or the cheeks
so this is really handy because it tells
you everything that is in my box yeah I
really really like the style of the Box
this month I think I'm ready to use this
for like drawing pins and safety pins
and all that kind of stuff afterwards I
can never bring myself to throw away the
birch boxes because they're so cute next
we've got a black package and yes I did
to scratch myself on the chin I always
try to figure out who that from I can't
actually see any brand on this one so
I'm gonna go ahead and shred it see
what's inside so I think
oh come forward oh my god
no this is not from Tom forward Tom Ford
orchids Olay oh okay so this is very
exciting I have a beautiful gold box
with Tom Ford orchids lay written on it
oh my gosh I was not expecting this
this is so exciting let's have a look
and this box isn't never gonna get
thrown away ever oh my freaking Lord
this isn't rose gold Tom Ford orchid
stelae Oh
oh my god I actually have no words oh
this is amazing I cannot wait to
photograph this oh my gosh oh I don't
know if this is the normal center is it
a little bit fresher
orchids on a maybe it's like a new
summer version orchid slate illuminates
Tom Ford's original obsession with the
elusive black orchid a radiant and
sensual fragrance and force of nature
the new set captures the seductive
warmth and reflective best skin of a Tom
Ford woman ah
guys this is amazing
well I just have no words I don't feel
like anything who top that so I probably
should have left that one to last I
didn't know what was in it and the next
thing I'm opening is a big pink box this
one that tells me who's from it says
Tangle Teezer on it I'm not sure what is
inside gosh it's very full so it let me
put the scissors down there we go
Sue's smoothie without the extra dose of
heat well okay so I think this is a
specific blow dry brush let's have a
little look so got a big ya blow dry
styling smoothing tool styles hair from
wet to dry that's really really handy
because when I don't want my hair to go
frizzy I use a paddle brush when I blow
dry but this one is specifically
designed for that for quick drying frizz
free hair so I look forward to giving it
that go and then I've got a bag which
has tangle teezer written on it feels
really heavy oh my god they've not
certainly a
dryer oh my gosh
wow I didn't know this brand is called
wow I don't know this brand it hairdryer
thought it was but the different
appliances oh my gosh
a purple hair dryer that's crazy gosh
thank you tangle teezer that is
absolutely mental I feel like there's
something else in here as well like to
be the instructions yeah it is it's the
diffuser ah that is crazy
oh my gosh wow I have been completely
spoiled next thing I'm not sure it's
actually blogger mail or if it's
something that I ordered myself because
it kind of looks like a book so I think
it might be is even for me or is it for
Charlie yes for me
yeah I don't remember ordering any books
and this one quite a while ago but let's
have a little look oh okay so this is
some Marco Polo guides because Charlie
no going to Croatia on Saturday so I
ordered a couple of guys just you can
get to know the local area so that's
what that is
and then I have another one wrapped in
craft paper
gosh it says that this cost 11 home to
post that's really expensive Royal Mail
is such a ripoff these days
but no idea where this is from so let's
shred it and find out okay we've got
gray bag within the craft paper still no
idea it says tough sack tough sack I
think that's the brand of the grey bag
not what's inside okay so now let's open
this together this is as much of a
surprise for you as it is for me some
third push PR hi Josie sorry couldn't
make it to our silk event but peace
finding place to a goodie bag oh my god
this is really kind of them lowly like
if you don't go to an event tough water
you don't get a goody bag I get your
silk on good right from the night your
own silk hair up to protect Oh
rehydrating River hair your locks it
sound exciting I always put my hair up
and while
showering when it's got deep conditioner
in so maybe this will be really good for
that oops from Monica like her from the
alkane avenues so Gus I can go to this
event I couldn't go because my hair took
about six or seven hours if not longer
in the color in the salon Wow one night
me hair cuticles dried flat flat against
soft material hair is protected in the
growing phase so let's kind of look gosh
there's so many exciting things in this
little box so cute okay I think this is
the hair urban that come a little look
think you're meant to wear it at night
rather than when our hair is wet so that
it protects your hair oh my gosh this is
so cute
I'm not gonna put on now something I had
a half up half down but follow me on
snapchat if you want to see me using
this because this is amazing I'm gonna
take it with me tonight
I'm staying overnight and at a hotel in
Surrey so I'm gonna take that with me
tonight a such a good idea what else
have we got
they sent a little goodie bag here some
side this one
Daisy jewelry oh that's so beautiful
it's a gorgeous little bracelet from
their brand Daisy
London I just love dainty little pieces
like this size so stunning I don't want
to lose I'm going to put that really
safe over there and then we've got a
kekeke a pen I absolutely love kqk
stationery oh my gosh and I've habits
journal this is amazing I was I'm this
up in the shop the other day that is
just so lucky we've got a couple of nail
polishes from their brand Mina which I
mentioned in a video a couple of weeks
ago what else we've got is this a candle
looks like it from census sheet it's
also herbal tea that is incredible and
then last but not least we have the Wren
wake wonderful nighttime facial which I
haven't used in so long but I remember
absolutely loving this stuff so I have
been at these spoils thank you to the
guys at push PR I can't wait to try the
hair
such a good idea and might have I wake
up in it's such a frizz bomb so if it
can help with that then I will be
forever grateful next up this one says
it's from L'Oreal I think I've opened a
L'Oreal one in the past on one of these
videos but I can never tell which brand
that's gonna be from but it looks like
it's from actual L'Oreal makeup because
of this little clip that's come inside
oh my gosh
I think it's a giant version of their
new cushion foundations Wow look at this
okay so inside I've got this giant pink
box how am I ever gonna store all of
these boxes I can't bring myself to
throw them away
and this says L'Oreal nude gosh
oh it says L'Oreal nude magic cushion
foundation on the lid and then inside
first of all that just dropped out is
this little mirror says hashtag tap tap
very very handy little mirror this is
gonna be really good for traveling
actually and then inside well this is
adorable I've got one two three four
five six of the L'Oreal nude magic
cushion foundations and also the cushion
bronze cushion de Soleil gum bronze
cushion de Soleil bronzer I've not tried
these products before but I have heard
really really good things so look at
this is so cute I can't wait to try this
as always keep an eye on my snapchat
where you will see first impressions I'm
going to take this with me tonight and
do my makeup with it tomorrow because I
can't wait to try it and obviously I've
heard such good things so I can't wait
to make up my own mind on the L'Oreal
nude magic cushion foundation I don't
know if there's anything else under
these or if it's just a giant cushion I
have a feeling it dextra just riding a
box I think it's like a giant cushion
that is so cute I think this is gonna be
one for my office I need a little back
support cushion so that is really
adorable now this one I was seriously
intrigued is a giant box which says Marc
Jacobs on it I think it might be a
couple of beauty products because it
feels quite light but let's have a look
inside the Marc Jacobs beauty I've only
really started discovering their
products reasons
and so far they are very very impressive
so let's have a little look what's
inside the box okay we are in let's have
a little look what's inside I was right
Marc Jacobs beauty introducing the
glowstick glistening and Luminator
oh gosh - sounds fun so we've got some
white tissue paper inside so if you can
hear some crackling by the way extras
shredding a box there we have three
little products inside glow stick
christening Luminator look I've got the
shade spotlight that packaging is just
so cute it's like a little kind of
tablets this looks like a cream stick of
highlighter which is so unusual I don't
think I've tried anything like this I
don't want to test out now it's on to
sit down front of the mirror and have a
proper play with this and I think
they've sent this in three Dexter I
think they said this in three different
shades I've got spotlight 700 oh and you
have three 700 so it looks like I have
three of the same products I will open
them after this video and double check
oh but really looking forward to trying
out these from Marc Jacobs and if you
would like to see a first impressions
video then let me know down below here I
have another plain black envelope which
is not giving anything away so I've got
no idea what is inside here and it is
from Fito I never know how to say this
it might be phyto haircut summer is in
the air halt
humidity hammers with fighter pliers
mimic spider fighter plage this summer
so keep her protected with the range of
Sun care for your hair this is amazing
so I've got a couple of really hot trips
coming up
it says summer is in the hair on this
little tote bag and then we have got
antique chlorine I think normal to dry
hair protector and then also anti
Sun and anti Tori protective Sun oil I
think my tried this last summer and it
was
to savior but I feel like this is a
lighter version my bottle last year was
really heavy so maybe they've repackaged
it ante sold ante chlorine with olive
wax the curious how oil and parts
showing while protecting your hair this
is going to come in so handy so I'm
definitely gonna put these in the pile
up to take with me to Croatia and Greece
because my hair would just be an
absolute nightmare if I didn't protect
it from the Sun salt chlorine etc okay
we're getting to the last few now and
this is another box which again that
doesn't have any information on it the
printing place limited comes from
Croydon apparently got no idea what's
inside this but it's a really big box
it's gonna be something exciting I'm
sure
let's have a little look oh my gosh I
think I know what this is ah so I have
seen a few people opening this on their
snapchats and I was really really hoping
I might get sent one and it is the
hocus-pocus brows are our focus kit from
benefit and oh my god have a look how
ginormous boxes so we have a huge box
says magically transforming since 1979
magically transforming four hours since
1979 let's see if I can get it out of
the box I'm gonna tip it upside down

this let's try to do that fancy and it
didn't work out so I got a ginormous box

so excited to see what is inside here

got sparse brows oh that's so cute so it
says I should use the conditioning
primer which is oh can I get that back
in which is this one here so this is a
whole new load of products from benefits
for the brow collection so this is a
conditioning primer which I guess will
help my brows to grow
if you've got thin brows and you've got
a newly packaged gimme brow which is
obviously an all-time favorite from a
benefit this is a whole new product
there goof proof brow pencil I've heard
really good things about this on the
videos I've seen so far it's got a
little pointed end good for filling in
color on your brows and then this is the
one I was really really excited about

bit like the Anastasia brow Wiz because
it's really super fine and this is in my
shade too I already let them know what
shade I was which we really go for
drawing in hair like brow hairs oh my
gosh I'm so excited by this oh what's

like the Anastasia one maybe a dip brow

little brush which looks kind of similar

eight on the eights where they send out
a few bloggers and press a little gift
eight of every month to celebrate their
eight hour cream obviously their
legendry products so what have we got

interesting whether it's for summer
festivals lying on the beach or walking
around town the eight hour cream
targeted some defense stick will happen

aren't exposed to burning that is so
handy especially light on the beach you
never even think about putting a
