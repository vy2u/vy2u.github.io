is going to be a blogger mail unboxing I
was just standing there kind of debating
do I open it on snapchat or Instagram
stories and I was frustrating myself
that I couldn't decide so I thought I
would just do on video instead so that's
what you guys are getting today I know
you've enjoyed these videos in the past
so hopefully this will be another fun
one so Charlie actually went down
städel for me last night and picked up
all these pieces I said it's made me
like 10 packages none of them are too
crazy huge so it should be quite a nice
I was going to seem realistic block of
mail but they're all obviously realistic
just like an average week of bloggers
melt so I'm not gonna run more to much
because I know these do tend to go on a
little bit before I do get started I
know a few you might be interested in my
lighting setup after my tech haul video
last Sunday and today for this video I
have got my ring light witnessed
diffuser on behind my tripod so if you
watched my tech core video you've seen
the epic design fail with a camera and
the diffuser don't fit on together and
but yeah I basically have my ring light
with a diffuser on behind the tripod so
let me know what you think of this
lighting setup it's fairly gray outside
so I wouldn't been able to film today if
it wasn't for what the ring light but I
think it looks quite clinical yeah not
to you I feel like it but let me know
and also second update my eyebrows I am
in love with so it's four days it's a
Saturday it is eight days since I had my
is eight days okay I don't know it's
about it's over a week it's maybe about
a week and a half since I had my brows
Micra bladed they scabbed up the scabs
came off they looked very bare and now
the colour is coming back again so I
feel like they look pretty good at the
moment all I've got in today is gimme
brow which obviously shapes your brows
and stops the heads from flying around
all over the place and adds a little bit
of volume but yeah I really really like
them I'm so pleased they're looking
naturally
so yeah thank you to everyone that left
lovely comments and for everyone that
has actually contacted Sean saying that
they want to get it done after seeing my
video it's amazing so yeah I'm glad
you've been enjoying with my brow
updates but anyway let's move on to the
blogger mail and I'm gonna start with
this chippy bag just sits right here it
is from QVC I'm guessing because there's
a QVC sticker on the label there so
let's have a little look what's inside
oh I think it's a load of tart goodies
let's have a look think that's
everything
it's one of these bags and I think it's
made like recycled material can you see
that it's like recycled I don't know but
it's getting all in the air its calories
okay so from Tarte skincare or Tarte via
QVC there is a set of I bag patches and
it's called pack your bags
nine-one-one under eye rescue patches
these kind of things for me are amazing
because I'd say under eye bags are my
biggest skincare concern I always seem
to have puffy eye bags no matter how
much sleep I get probably because of
dehydration but yeah these say that they
soothe and hydrate your delicate
under-eye area to fight the signs of
puffiness so that sounds amazing got a
little note and then also what's this
and also they've sent me a tart ring for
us of a/c primer setting spray marine
boosting mist that sounds really
intriguing so it's a primer spray it
says four in one in lick so it works as
primer setting spray hydrating mist and
skin refresher all in one skin vigor
eating formula lightweight miss perhaps
the skin to help minimize your
principles and redness and extends the
wear of makeup that sounds incredible
that sounds like a really useful product
and I didn't know the Tarte did this
I've really loved everything that I've
tried so far from the rainforest of the
sea range and of course QVC as far as
I'm aware is the only place you can get
tart e
in the UK without paying extortion at
shipping fees so yeah nice a couple of
bits and bobs fondant at next there is a
carrier bag from boss Hugo Boss so got
feeling this is going to be a fragrance
as far as on my Hugo Boss is just
immense well correct me if I'm wrong
although actually I feel like the store
on Sloane Square has women as well so
maybe that's just load of rubbish but
anyway God foods give me a fragrance and
it is so this is Hugo Boss the scent for
her not a terribly imaginative name but
really nice box another pink perfect
shade of pink this is literally my gosh
I could not be more similar color wise
oh wow that is beautiful gorgeous little
bottle really really like this design
that is very very pretty very classic
design that's a little oh oh my gosh oh
that smells lovely spritz myself in that
so this is an irresistible fragrance
unforgettable as shall we say it's it's
very unusual I've not smell anything
like this exquisite notes of honey to
peach delicate freesia blossom
captivating osmanthus loud and intensely
roasted cocoa to seduce the senses mmm
to be honest there are all smells I
would not have recognized I would not
even know to tell you what was in this
but now that I've read it there is
something really really nice about this
I think it's actually one of my favorite
fragrances I've smelt in a long time so
I'll be interested to see how this lasts
as the day goes on because obviously
fragrances the longer you wear them they
kind of settle and then the base notes
start to come out but the top notes on
this really lovely and sweet and I'm
looking forward to seeing how it was so
thank you Hugo Boss and I think this
could be an could become a favorite next
I have a fairly heavy package from the
body shop
I actually think I know what's in this
because I've seen it on a couple of
people's snapchats
so let's see if I'm right or missing me
in there it's press release yes I think
I'm pretty sure this is their new face
masks so let me open it up and show you
guys so inside there's this kind of I
want to say Harlequin design new it's
not really is it this very cool design
in a box and then you open it up and
inside
let me just spin the round is the new
collection of face masks from the body
shop so I actually have a funny story
about this one here so this is the
British Rose fresh plumping mask and I
actually already had one of these and I
took it to cut swords with me last
weekend to photograph the blog post
featuring it might be up already and so
I tried it out I loved it wanting to
feature in a blog post but basically um
Charlie and I were given a not very
photogenic bathroom so we went into one
of the journalists bathrooms before they
checked in because it was like a shared
house we weren't like sneaking into a
room I thing and took the photos in her
bathroom and there was this a
bareMinerals face mask and a Bobbi Brown
face mask and I left them in her
bathroom so obviously when she arrived I
couldn't go in and be like oh I just
left all my products in your bathroom so
she thought that they were like gifts
that the room that the hotel had
laughter when actually they are my
products so yeah I'm very pleased to
have another one of these so that's the
Rose fresh pumping mask haven't tried
the other one these sound incredible so
this Amazonian acai I used to say acai
but I think it's a star I correct me if
I'm wrong and that is for energizing
then from nourishing there's Ethiopian
honey
deep nourishing masque that sounds
amazing Chinese ginseng and rice
clarifying polish mask for illuminating
the skin British Rose which is for
hydration and then Himalayan charcoal
purifying glow mask these all sound
absolutely incredible and I love the
body shop just everything that I try
from them is fantastic I think the only
other marks that I've tried is their
three-in-one scrub mask which I adore so
looking forward to giving all of these
ago and it seems to be one for every
in cat concern such cute packaging as
well I love how they present this I
wonder if you can actually buy them as a
set let's see the press release says
anything so it doesn't say if you can
buy a set as it is I have a feeling that
you probably can't this might just be a
press version and but the masks are out
now and they're 15 pounds each from the
body shop and as always I would do my
first impressions on snapchat and things
that absolutely love will be on the blog
so don't forget to follow all of those
channels and they are linked as always
down below next I've got a plain black
bag I have no idea what's in this Oh
Sarah Chapman let's have a little look
so this is the Sarah Chapman lash
boosting I fans that is such a good idea
so listen I makeup remover that
apparently is lash boosting triple
action I makeup remover sweeps away
waterproof mascara refreshes tide eyes
helps reduce puffiness and promotes
longer thicker lashes and brows that is
such a genius idea like incredible so I
will let you guys know if this works
because this sounds absolutely fabulous
let's see how big the actual product is
so you've got a 75 ml bottle here it's a
very chic packaging as you'd expect from
Sarah Chapman and so this is going to
look beautiful in my bathroom it's 32
pounds for 70 ml so not cheap as far as
eye makeup remover goes but if those
benefits truly work and then I think
that's a really good multitasking
product as I said before first
impressions and my lasting impressions
will be on the blog and snapchat so I
will definitely let you know how I get
along with this because that sounds
incredible so thank you Sarah Chapman
for sending
Oberth me to try this is from sugar hill
boutique which if i remember correctly
is an online clothing retailer i think
they sent me their lookbook a little
while ago to choose something i can't
remember what i chose so let's open this
up and look in a bag oh yes now so very
kindly sent me this beautiful blouse
it's a long sleeve blouse you've got is
it long sleeve yeah long sleeve blouse
with kind of cuff details at the bottom
and then there is a almost choker like
 bow type and fastening under the
collar there and the pattern is all
these different feathers which I just
thought was so unusual I love wearing
things like this in autumn and I can
wear a thermal underneath them when it
gets cold and then just a tree chic with
jeans so I've got a feeling I will be
wearing this quite a lot so thank you
sugar hill a boutique for sending that
one over another plain one that I'm not
sure what's inside let's have a little
look Emelia right that's interesting I'm
not heard about this before ameliorate
Amelia right I'm sorry I'm saying that
wrong skin soothing body lotion a
ground-breaking body lotions forcibly
don't offer effective therapy for the
silent population 40% of the population
who suffer from skin prone to keratosis
pilaris chicken skin okay actually asked
of mothers a charlie of the day it's
actually not something that i suffer
from and but if you do some fun chicken
skin and then perhaps this is a good one
to try it says Jenny exfoliates
targeting rough bumpy areas and it's a
body lotion so that sounds like a really
good multitasking product I will give a
go and let you know how it feels and the
texture and everything but I can't be
comment on chicken
not something that my personally have
this one says Elemis on it so no
surprises here this one's problem not
sure what's inside so we shall we shall
see superfood facial oil from nourishing
the face that sounds pretty good so I
absolutely love oils my skin loves when
I apply oils this says 100% natural
blend of highly concentrated plant-based
superfoods deepening nourishes and
hydrates antioxidant and Omega rich
broccoli flaxseed and daikon raddish
feed the skin for a healthy radiant glow
that sounds amazing I am really into
super foods eating wise at the moment
and I love oils so this potentially
could be a really good one for me really
cute little bottle as well
looks very high-end and Spira SH they're
very excited to give this one a go then
a pink package I just cannot get rid of
these envelopes first so pretty and this
one looks like it's from Kiehl's so this
is the ultra facial cream but a giant
enormous version so I actually have a
very small version of this think it's
even a sample and and this is the 24
hour everyday hydrating formula I'm
presuming it's the same as what I've got
but they've got a very colorful lid on
this one it says it's the Laura Mvula
I'm not sure about as MTV staying alive
joining forces to empower young women
around the world so maybe this is a
charity version let me have a quick read
of the press release okay yes that's
exactly what's happened so the press
release has been kindly hand written out
this must have taken some a lot of time
we're thrilled to share our latest
campaign to support our charity partner
MTV staying alive foundation please
enjoy the limited edition design about
ultra facial cream and to celebrate this
gift of product to you we would be
thrilled to donate ten pound on your
half upon your tweet or Instagram of our
collaboration news to followers that's
amazing
so every time a blogger that sent NIST
as a tweet or Instagram with the hashtag
heels times NTV saf they will donate ten
pounds so guess what I know we're doing
straight after filming this video
that's amazing and for every one of
these sold they're also going to donate
ten pounds to the staying alive
foundation and it retails for let's have
a look
annoyingly I can't see anywhere on here
where it retails for I've read the whole
thing I've scanned the whole thing and I
can't see where it says what it retails
for but wherever it is 10 pounds the
sale of foundation is a really really
generous donation I find it a little bit
annoying when brands donate like one
pound from a 35-pound list it's not
mentioning any names but this is
actually a really really generous amount
and a little bit about the same Life
Foundation it's all about helping
countries that are affected by HIV it
says they've distribution 86 million
dollars to grassroots HIV prevention
projects and a UK registered charity and
kills are also gonna be hosting in-store
fundraising events to help fund these
important educational projects in India
and Africa so kills are doing a lot for
the stang Life Foundation which is
really really lovely
there's also some information about it
on the pot so a really lovely
collaboration with keels so keep an eye
on my Twitter and Instagram for this so
that keels will make it the 10 pound
donation on my behalf as well and you
didn't want to buy the cream we still
want to donate you can donate to charity
by texting HIV three to seven oh six six
zero to donate five pounds or ten pounds
so I'll leave that information down
below so you can donate to the charity
even if you don't fancy the cream next I
have another little bag and this is from
pestle and mortar very cute little bag
and let's see what is inside this is a
soup star retinol night oil a superior
blend of cold-pressed organic oils and
we're loving the organic oils at the
moment and along with omegas 3 &amp;amp; 6 so
yeah a night oil that's something that
you put on before your moisturizer
moisturizer will be the final step with
a unique piece of technology gets to
work while you're sleeping and fusing
skin with two types of rational helping
to reduce pore size lines and even out
skin texture and tone so large pores are
some number and concerned about at the
moment
pulls my chin that especially it's
really weird I don't know why they're so
big at the moment so I'm gonna give this
a try it tonight to hope that it will do
something about it right and of course
it's one of the best ingredients you can
put on your skin for improving the
texture and everything I've tried from
this brand before I've loved so high
hopes for this one next I have a square
shaped box I have feeling this is going
to be batiste dry shampoo just from the
PR company I know they look after
batiste and I know but these things
often come in boxes shape so let's see
oh actually from Nana so now obviously
hair removal cream and that's how they
look what is inside the box oh wow
lots and lots of things so we've got
this is the box inside in case you're
wondering a little note some extra bits
for Charlie so basically Charlie and
featured in his blog post 10 things I
still for my girlfriend and one of them
was the hair removal creams they put in
a couple bits and bobs for us to fight
over there's facial wax strips not sure
I've using those not sure I will either
because I didn't have much based on that
but um I will give them to somebody who
does I'll be for all that all good thing
to pass on there wouldn't it here I
think you might need these facial hair
removing wax strips facial brush on dry
sensitive that's a really good idea
actually brush on facial and hair
remover then the upper lip kit of course
I'm trying to say something you know and
also the shower power cream which is a
personal favorite you put it on before
you get in the shower and then I just
what it works really really well they've
also put some fun props in here as well
let's see we've got some beautiful
glasses and a bowtie little bowtie and
English - perhaps I do need the ultra
facial hair remover if I have a
moustache oh my god you're kidding me I
think this is a loony phone case holy
 is it huh oh my god it is but I
don't think this is gonna fit my phone
I've got the six plus
oh my god this so annoying I have wanted
a Lumi phone case for so it's so so long
and this is one but it doesn't fit my
phone oh my god that is so annoying
maybe when the iPhone 7 comes up it says
shape I'm literally gonna get a small
one just so I can use this phone case
can't you guys just buy a bigger phone
case and stop being so stingy just buy
one J's so the whole point of the phone
case is that it's being your own selfie
filter so really similar inner radiance
with no light up from every angle with
the enriched argan oil and fragrant
cherry blossom formulas so I see the
time now thank you very much now this is
a really lovely package of goodies just
two more to go and here is another box
it's like Christmas unwrapping all these
presents I honestly so thankful for this
very generous friends this all another
one from QVC oh my gosh AHA so this is
the Jay Manuel Beauty range obviously
Jay Manuel is one of the judges and
America's Next Top Model I used to love
watching that program and he's fallouts
a range of beauty products I think
they're exclusive to QVC yes in UK at
least so he's got a powder blush filter
finished collection bronzer ultimate
lipstick brows so many things mascara
filter finish photo illusion concealer
that's all obscene based around like
photoshoots and skin facelift doesn't
say what that is soft finishing powder
this is a lip gloss and this one is skin
perfecting foundation so I'm guessing
these are going to be really good for on
camera so I'll give these a go the next
time I'm doing my makeup for a day
filming I hope you'll be perfect for
that
last but not least another white box and
you're gonna have to get my scissors out
to get into this one gosh so we have
quite a selection of products in here
very very generous
it's caught my eye oh my god hourglass
ambient lighting blush oh my god that's
amazing this actually it's really thin
for the hourglass blushes and wonder
they've got new packaging or maybe I'm
just so used to the Kron zorbing fats oh
look oh my gosh that is I'm so excited
to try this
well I think this is another thing from
hourglass Oh cover effects similar gold
packaging custom enhancer drops I wonder
if you put these in your foundation
orange treat what is this shake well
before use I think maybe it could be
like to darken your foundation or to add
highlight oh wow I think it's a
foundation adjuster so really good if
you come back from holidays if you are a
little bit darker but you don't want to
buy a whole new foundation put some
drops in that those things are color
effects also have an hourglass satin
finish nujin umber 3 I think this is a
lipstick wow wow oh my gosh that is so
beautiful that shade is so me wow wow
that's amazing
I cannot wait to try this bone in to
photograph it first because it's so
stunning
gosh that's firm nude lip steel oh ah I
think that's gonna be a favorite I think
i swatched these in Sephora when I was
in New York last year and loved them
this is oh I think that's a stomp of a
perfume and then we've got bliss H a
exfoliating foot cream obviously I went
to the Bliss Spa last week he's throwing
my blog and I just found love with loads
of things and they've always been taken
note and sent me a couple of things I
said I loved radiance restoring mist and
this one has an T environmental
aggressor in it so it creates a bit of a
shield against environmental dirt in the
air this is oh the Emidio right or
dilution again for chicken skin so it
must be the same PR company softening
gloves really good idea if you have dry
hands
chapped skin so if you can hear the rain
by the way absolutely torrential out
there and oh no actually these are socks
so if you've got dry skin on your feet
you can just put these on overnight wake
up in lovely
skin on your feet pot salt scrub a nice
body scrub and then instant energizing
eye mask so these you pop the liquid
into the eye mask which activates it pop
them on like on dry things probably
p-diddy as a big fan because P duty
maybe it's jazzy some very cool gangster
person it's a big fan of these so
hopefully I will be - as I said under
eye bags are my my nemesis I can't wait
to try these and that is absolutely
everything from my little dawdle here
Boxhall rod melon boxing as always so
many incredible things which I'm very
very grateful to receive I wouldn't be
able to share with you guys anywhere
near as much as I do if it wasn't for
all of these press samples it is a major
major perk of the job and something I've
worked very hard to get to and I know
you guys actually really do understand
that I see a lot of vloggers giving
almost disclaimers at beginning of these
videos but you guys are so understanding
you get it you get this part of the job
it's a major perk of the job and I'm
just very very grateful so many amazing
things to try so I hope you enjoyed this
video I'm gonna go and have some
breakfast now Charlie's chatting up
between that's some avocado on toast is
waiting with me downstairs so I hope you
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
if you did and if you enjoy this type of
videos and I'll leave any product links
to things that out now down below and
I'll see you in the next one that's all
for me
