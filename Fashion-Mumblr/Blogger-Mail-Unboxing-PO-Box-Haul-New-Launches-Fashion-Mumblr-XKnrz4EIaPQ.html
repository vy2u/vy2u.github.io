would do a bit of vlogger mail unboxing
I sometimes do this on my snapchat and
you guys seem to really enjoy watching
the kind of things that I sometimes get
sent in the post and because it was
Fashion Week last week I didn't go down
to my double which is kind of like a p.o
box I didn't go down there for a little
while so I have a few bits and bobs
which I haven't opened yet and I just
can't wait to see what's in the side so
I thought I would film this video and we
can open them together I feel like I
don't even need to say it but obviously
I'm not showing off I just thought it
would be interesting to see the kind of
things I've been sent always sleep
brands like to send to bloggers and
youtubers to review things so that we
can tell you guys all about them and I
thought it would be really fun to have a
little look at the kind of things I
would send recently I personally love
this kind of thing I love to be nosy so
yeah I thought you might enjoy watching
it I'm actually gonna get started with
this which is a goodie bag from a Rimmel
event that I went to not last night but
the night before and as you can see I
have had a little poke inside just cuz
there is really intrigued to know loads
of bits and bobs rattling around but
before I get on to it my parcels I
thought I would just share with you and
the kind of things that US bloggers are
really lucky to get in goodie bags
so obviously this event was a Truman
event and they were launching their
spring/summer 16 collection so in here
I've got quite a lot of products which
are either out really recently or are
coming your way into places like books
and Superdrug really soon so first of
all there's loads of new nail varnishes
four five six seven nail varnishes and I
think that was actually eight because I
did do my nails for each one of them
last night and these are basically the
super gel new range of nail varnishes
and apparently they're going to last two
weeks although let's see if that is true
but there's also some really beautiful
cousin here there's some new ones from
the cake collection this is a cake one
this kind of coral and then a nude one
in fact they might all be yellow Kate
Moss design so lots of lovely colors and
then there's also a topcoat and you have
to put two layers of this on to create
that really strong to weak holes lots of
new knowledge is coming our way from
Rimmel also inside we have a range of
new Rimmel lipsticks and these are their
new moisture renew sheer and shine
lipsticks and firstly I love the
packaging this gorgeous kind of pink
sheer lipstick and I remember them
saying that the lipsticks themselves are
really sheer as well and really nice and
hydrating almost like a cross between a
balm and lipstick and you can see here
loads of really gorgeous colors I will
do some close-ups so that you guys can
see the beautiful colors I think I
really like the look of this one in
particular there we go really liked the
look of this one which is number six
hundred which is spin all spring that's
a lovely kind of coral color and there's
a really beautiful nude this is number
seven hundred I think they're going to
be once I reach for quite regularly so
I'll give those little try and let you
guys know hide it on if throughout this
video there are some products which you
think they're create interesting and you
definitely want me to review them well
let you know my first impressions then
either comment down below and then we
have a couple of new things from the
Kate Moss collection this is a highlight
and contour and blush trio so I've got a
couple of different shades here golden
bronze and coral glows I guess it
depends
on your skin type and just the packaging
and getting really beautiful noise from
rose gold
it's a powder formula so great if you
maybe prefer powder to do your contour
with and they look very they look like a
really lovely natural color so I'm
looking forward to giving theirs ago
this is a new browser sway highlighting
pencils so great for getting underneath
the eyebrows and just creating a little
bit of color to open up the eye area a
nice champagne color and then we've got
two of the insta flawless tinted primer
so these are a base for your makeup
it says perfection radiant skin tint
with SPF 15 I've got light medium and
medium dark so two new colors to try of
that one three new eyeliners in blue
black and white and on the image on the
screen and they showed us the
presentation they look like really bold
colors I never would have thought that
white would be able to come up quite so
clearly but oh my gosh you can see on my
hands it's really like a permanent
marker very clearly coming out there
which is amazing for a wipe so we really
cool if you want to do some really
intricate detailed buy designs and a
black and clear as well and last but not
least we have the volume colorist
mascara now I've actually been testing
this out on the down low for the past
few weeks because this mascara is
something that you really get the
benefit after using it for a few weeks
because it's basically got an ingredient
in it which slowly tints your lashes
over time which before a blonde like me
is so amazing because in summer when I
go on holiday I like to get my lashes
tinted so that when I'm in the pool I
don't try mascara and I still have nice
dark lashes and this mascara does that
like gradually over a couple of weeks
you'll notice your lashes start to get
darker as well as having mascara on so
this is an amazing new launch I think
it's out now
no 16th of March so a little a little
bit longer to wait for this one but
again let me know if you'd like me to do
a full review of this you know how I'm
getting on with them and then the last
thing in my room oh goody bag is the
press release so it's got the
information about the new garnishes so
lots of lovely things to try it from
runoff so now I'm going to get on to my
parcels things which have been sent to
me to my PO Box so I'm going to go ahead
and open this one I have more lipstick
so these are from Bourjois we've got
four Wow very generous 8 lipsticks let's
see these they look very similar to the
rouge Velvets there's very similar kind
of packaging but more matte let's take a
really nice coral color so Rouge Edition
that souffle develops and this is oh one
orange leaked so this is a really lovely
color so I'm guessing it's going to be a
more matte version oh well it's almost
like a powdery matte version of their
velvet lip glosses which I really really
loved forget what gosh there's so many I
can't even hold them so we've got a
really lovely selection of shades here
it's quite hard to show you ranging from
the oranges to the peachy Pink's right
through to the like kind of purpley pink
so lovely very spring/summer shade of
range of colors from flora and I'm
really looking forward to giving you to
try I think matte lips is definitely my
favorite lip texture so I will let you
know how I get in love with those this
big envelope said it was coming from
L'Oreal so could be any other brands
that are owned by L'Oreal oh and it
seems shampoo and conditioner from pure
ology now pure ology is one of my
absolute favorites when it comes to
shampoo conditioner for my colored hair
this is the perfect for platinum which
you guys probably know that I absolutely
love it featured in my hair care routine
a few weeks ago and they very kindly
topped me up with the shampoo
conditioner and reconstructing masks
which is really good timing because I've
had my hair colored recently so it's
great to use shampoos and conditioner
that's specifically targeted for colored
hair so in Thank You L'Oreal for the top
up next inside this really cute
envelope I'm not sure who this is from
let's have a look spray and play what's
that
spray and play with the world's first
mask primer maximize your mask with skin
optimizing Maximizer from origins the
eku's number one last Bretton so this
brow skin and optimizing master primer
this is really interesting so I guess
it's just a way of preparing the skin
before makeup but because origins are so
well known for their master safe put
like a mask spin on it and spray the
clean skin lightly patent to apply the
mask close eyes before spraying just a
quick spritz gets the skin primed ready
to reach it's the most flawless
potential that's a really nice idea of
putting a mask on your skin before you
do your makeup cool packaging it's very
different than usual
origins masks but I'll give that I try
the morning check my snapchat ality for
me see how you get along with this once
oh and there's something else in here as
well a little mini of the original skin
which is so handy because when I go on
my holidays or anything like that I'd
love to take a little face mask with me
and this is one of my favorites okay so
I'm pretty sure there's gonna be a birch
box inside this because it's the birch
box packaging it doesn't feel heavy
enough to have a box in oh is this
strange it's not a birch box it is birch
Brooks launches its first in-house
makeup brand gosh that's exciting
so it's called lock which is love of
color right here oh it's such a nice
packaging but pass the parcel so
so inside I've got five little crayons
and are they i crayons or lip skinny-dip
vibrant matte lipstick that sounds
really really nice and this is the
lovely kind of golden pink color in a
very very humbug size lip it's like a
crayon that's why I thought it wasn't
wasn't I cram so much of their all lips
oops
champagne problems one and done shadow
stick okay so they're all similar
packaging but we've got some eye shadows
and some lip colors present when I just
dropped all of these lovely colors very
wearable colors are not sure too sure
about the purple but I love these kind
of champagne Toby pink color it's really
beautiful selection so once again let me
know if you'd like to see some first
impressions of these from Birch boxes
and those see I always love to know what
other bloggers doing packaging because
to me I'm such a hoarder that I don't
want to throw away tissue paper so I
always keep it in a little bag and drop
people's presence in it I'm such a
cheapskate but you know it's so pretty
definitely want to recycle all these
things I'm skinned up next I've got this
rather heavy box and again I have no
idea what's in here quite heavy
sounds like liquid so let's get mine up
so I'm going to take my trusty nail
scissors and see what's inside
it's resorting to shredding the Box now
it's another pass the parcel of box
within a box still no branding so I got
absolutely no idea who this is from
let's have a look inside the box
to Josie I hope you like the products
let me know Jess from OGS so OGX is a
haircare company and this says and the
award goes to
oh so it's sort of afters or visit the
Oscars
Josie fear for great hair oh my gosh
that is so cute so I've got my own
little award here from oceaxe
this is absolutely adorable let's open
meet the golden envelope
I never went brands to stuff like this
with the award season full swing it's
only right that we take a moment to
recognize and celebrate excellence in
cinematic achievements basically we love
what you do have a happy hair day this
is so amazing thank you ho GX and you've
also put in a set of the coconut milk
shampoo and conditioner which is a
really good unisex one both me and
Charlie both absolutely love this so we
get through it like there's no tomorrow
in the shower and then also a coconut
oil weightless hydrating oil mist which
is amazing for holidays because it
doesn't bulk the hair down it's nice and
light one of my favorites and really not
that expensive either considering how
much you can pay for oils so such a
lovely selection from odx
and my award for great hair ah typical
that I open this mail and I'm having the
worst headache ever hence my very floppy
plat but thank you anyway next I have a
delivery from a source but I haven't
ordered anything but I have but nothing
that should have arrived in anything
this small so that's a little look Oh
what's in here
a sauce with NYX NYX now at a sauce we
wanted to share some of our best sellers
that we are eight we at Asus beauty love
so we have some new NYX bits in this
little lace bag some of our best sellers
and so I've got three little products
here and this one is a jumbo eye pencil
in night show value which is a black
color then a lovely little blush and a
soft matte lip cream now this I have
been dying to try out ever since a girl
I think like a year ago was wearing a
beautiful red lipstick and she said it
was by NYX and was just such a lovely
consistency so as I said earlier I love
matte lipsticks night mask get into so
this is a lovely pink color I'm going to
have a little look on the website and
see if they've gone kind of brownie
Kylie Jenner shades which I'm loving at
the moment but this is a very pretty
kind of girly pink which I absolutely
adore so NYX is now available on a sauce
so yeah I guess I'm going to be going on
a sauce after I finish drawing this
video I have another unbranded envelope
so another one that I've got no idea who
sent it which is always always fun
so this is New Jersey peace finding
please in person new hydro gel patches
from mask bar so mile spa do one of my
favorite face masks we peel off the
charcoal it's slightly painful you guys
always contour my snapchat when I'm
doing it because you're like yeah looks
like it really hurts it does a little
bit but it's worth it
these are new hydrogel dark spot eye
patches in a box which is strange
because normally they selling their self
pouches oh that's interesting
so it's in one of these little tubs oh
my gosh that's not what I was expecting
dark spot eyepatch but it's a tub of gel
do you make it yourself ah okay so it
has loads of patches within the pot
sounds good
give those a world later on tonight and
then I have a goodie bag which just came
with an address label on it so must have
been biked over and this is from ghost
so the fragrance company ghost and
inside this very bright goodie bag we've
got some pressed information oh and some
sticker sheets that's rather cute got a
couple of sheets of stickers including
some colorful alphabet stickers and then
some stickers for the perfume and the
press release which has got a little
unicorn pin badge stuck to it
following the hugely successful bunch of
ghosts killed in 2015
ghost has introduced the hottest new
fragrance in the collection ghost crush
so let's have a look oh yes we have got
a full of ghost crush which is in a
packaging so I will leave it that way
and do first impressions over on my
snapchat but I think that the ghost
fragrances are such good prices I think
they are was it say 25 pounds which is
is really amazing for perfume of this
quality I do find them quite sweet but
not sickly sweet like you sometimes get
with non designer perfumes I look
forward to giving that little go and
then there's also a little pencil in
that as well for making some fragrance
notes and then finally I have a big
envelope here with a body shop sticker
on it surprises oh my gosh it's
literally an envelope filled with rose
petals I think they're scented though
yeah literally just filled with rose
petals okay so we've got the information
I'd like to show a new body shop
collection British rose and in a British
interpretation a timeless icon of
femininity canine capers for Mother's
Day the Royals are back with Body Shop
and Belle's treatment cream and then
smells so heavenly so firstly I've got a
big tub of The Body Shop British Rose
instant below body butter so I love the
body butters are so thick and creamy but
this one smells absolutely heavenly and
apparently is going to give my skin
nice below as well oh gosh that's
absolutely gorgeous it's kind of like a
highlight but for your body so that's
gonna be really lovely on tanned limbs
in the summer and then there is a petal
soft hand cream this is quite a big tube
of hand cream I'm guessing it's got
smell the same as the body lotion so
absolutely incredible quite a nice spice
to put on your desk or maybe by your
bedside table for putting on at night
then wrapped up in bubble wrap let's see
what this is this is the British rose
petal soft bath foam another lovely
scented product I haven't had a bath in
quite a while actually so I think this
is a good excuse me to have one tonight
and then last but not least we have
another bubble wrapped one and this is
the instant glow body essence so wonder
if this is oh yes a fast absorbing body
moisturiser so I guess this is one for
more in an everyday basis Rose you could
use the body butter on those days and
wants a little bit of extra pampering so
that is the few bits and pieces I have
been sent over the past few days hope
you guys have enjoyed looking through
those with me I think it's really nice
to share the opening of the bloggers
mail with you it's definitely a perk of
the job something that is something that
I'm very grateful for and yeah I thought
it'd be nice to share that with you hope
you guys enjoyed this video and do let
me know if you want me to do more of
this type of video obviously it's my
first let me know if you enjoyed it give
it a thumbs up if you have and maybe I
should do a few more if you want to see
this kind of thing um more regularly
than I do quite often snapchat when I
open up my post and sometimes brands
will do really crazy outrageous things
and send really mental packages like for
example on Valentine's Day Bron sent a
big crate of cactuses along with a razor
being like no prickles for your
boyfriend on Valentine's Day so brands
they do put a lot of effort in and do
really cool stuff so follow me on
snapchat like see
that kind of thing and hope you guys
having a lovely day and I will see you
very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
