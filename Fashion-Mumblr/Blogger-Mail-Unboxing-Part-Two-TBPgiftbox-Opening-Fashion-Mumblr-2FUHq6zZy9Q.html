blogger Mel unboxing videos you might
have seen part 1 last Wednesday and I
just didn't have time to get through
everything and I was still holding onto
this massive box which I think I
mentioned at the end of last week's
video so I thought I would go through
this box and a couple of other pieces
with you in today's videos so this is my
blogger mail unboxing slash P o box haul
whatever you want to call it part two
I'm using natural light to film this
video because Charlie's lil sister is
staying in this room this week and I
packaged away all my lighting so I hope
you guys don't mind the slightly shadowy
effects that we've got going on today
but apart from that let's get started so
I'm going to kick off with this
ginormous box and I always try and do a
bit of detective work to figure out who
it's from and this one actually says
it's from the blogger program and I've
seen other bloggers getting big
deliveries from the blogger program
before but I have not done before so
it's gonna be pretty exciting to see
what is in here let's use my trusty nail
scissors to get this box open and cut
myself okay and so looks like a couple
of really big boxes in here starting
with a shoebox let's put that to the
side first because there's some
paperwork in here as well and then we
have another oh my gosh
ginormous white box I'm gonna put the
this box down here
just to save a little bit of space so
I've got a postcard from the blogger
program we're so happy to have you as
part of our gift box campaign lovely
runs of contributions this box to give
you a glimpse of their brand and for you
to share your unboxing with your
followers that's handy I'm doing it like
this we love that you're part of our
ever-growing blogging community with
over 20,000 likewise bloggers the site
allows you to manage auto campaigns in
one place over a thousand brands for you
to connect and collaborate with so
that's a little bit of information about
the blogger program now let's have a
little look what is inside the box gosh
so first of all there is this giant pink
fluffy item what's this a love clothing
jacket from a brand called olives that's
it or what love clothing not sure let's
hang out with that oh my gosh this is
literally the brightest piece of
clothing that I will ever owned that is
very very bright to my gosh so if I was
a cyclist this is what I would wear to
do my cycling because I'm pretty sure
this is fluorescent and then you've got
a car key car key lining I love bright
things for like when I'm walking the
dogs in the evenings because you know
it's just too dangerous to wear double
clothing especially if you live in the
city like I do and then I'm not sure if
this is from the same around I'm not
really a leather jacket person the only
leather jacket that I own is a brown
leather jacket so I'll see if I can rock
a black white and this is a brand called
altered image quite funky for me but you
never know we might be able to rock it
you love your jackets we have a huge
range on line at your shoes and then
some very kind of gothic looking tattoos
there think I might give these to my
niece yeah she's a little bit more
gothic than I am so here we have
something from wonder luck and if I
remember correctly I think these guys
are 3d printed jewelry yes it says on
the car that they are 3d printed jewelry
so let's have a little look what is it
oh yeah I actually selected this one so
this is like a crazy black I'll do a
little close-up ring god knows how they
print a 3d and then it's got two
ginormous crystals in it so that is just
incredible I think the machine has
printed that out I have no idea how they
do it very clever technology these days
and that's from wonder luck then we have
something from the House of Fraser
so we have and it'll make up bag I'm not
sure if this is a brand or if it's a
House of Fraser own brand but a nice
clear makeup bag good for traveling with
too many ones inside I could be a nice
little coin purse or troubling makeup
bags this one's a really good size
actually for the handbag so you have a
trio of makeup bags on half the Fraser
and then we have a wash oh my gosh I fit
this is an activity tracking watch
normally I don't like activity watches
because they're not very attractive
actually that is rather beautiful again
I'll do a close-up but this looks really
clever lightweight durable body scratch
resistant glass just a wrist band that
looks really really snazzy I will let
you know how I get on with this on my
snapchat so keep a lookout for that
because this does look really cool
definitely the kind of thing I need to
sit down and read the instruction
manuals for and that's from a brand
called I fit and then a few more bits
and bobs in the bottom here this is
Schulich what is this I think it's to
put on the soles of your heels that is
very random it's kind of like a gold
sticker to pimp up the soles of your
shoes shoe Knicks pimp my heels
interesting and it looks like there's a
few different versions in there as well
but it's quite cool on photo and then
lastly we have these shoes from a brand
cause to me I believe I actually chose
these as well I'm not sure what designer
chose it as little while ago so that's
kinda look oh yeah so we have some
lovely summery sandals I've got a really
nice chunky heel and then like a plaited
detail around the edges and then this
wraps up your leg which I find is really
nice and comfy keeps my feet in place no
doubt I'll be featuring these in some
upcoming outfit of the day post so keep
your eye out for this clothing now style
really nicely quite a classic design so
thank you sue me so that's everything
that I got from the blogger program gift
box I've believe I also have some
discount codes for these items so I will
leave the links to everything and
discount codes down below so you guys
can check them out next moving on to a
few more bits that I got from my double
box this I've just seen in the
light-reflecting for it
it's from L'Occitane so let's have a
look what is inside once again a really
nice packaging which I won't be throwing
away Oh
velvet gems that's what this says how
interesting
oh my gosh it's almond that is my
favorite scent in the whole world it
just makes me think of macaroons and
marzipan really nice packaging as well
from L'Occitane it's like light pink and
blue almost like the ladder a shop so
youthful hand cream with SPF 15 I think
that's a really good idea because your
hands are one of the quickest parts of
your body to age so that will be really
really handy I'm just gonna put some of
this on because actually I washed my
hands before the video and I didn't put
on any hand cream oh oh my god
that is so lovely it's like a very fresh
almond scent not too not too overbearing
if you don't actually like the fragrance
of almond something that it's quite
subtle so really like the packaging of
this one and lovely products I'm just a
huge fan of L'Occitane or look however
you say it
hand cream that's a nice one I'll pop in
my handbag then I have a mystery gray
package Polly
oh I think mrs. also something that I
ordered from Amazon let me have another
yes it's a tape dispenser I swear I open
one of these in the last video as I was
saying when I ordered stuff from ASOS
sometimes 90% of the time there's gonna
be at least one thing that I need to
return and I'm just tired of the
nicotine
tying up the bag with bits of seller
tapes I thought I'd buy myself a tape
dispenser next we have a very light box
it says it's from death cm I have no
idea who that is
it looks like the kind of shape that an
iPhone would come in but it's definitely
too like to be an iPhone so let's see
what's in here okay there's a little
postcard that says we are changing
everything hi Josie hope you enjoy using
this prismatic primer from hilar mind
you can use an Android foundation here's
a press release paper and then
this is the foundation by the might okay
not foundation primer it's kind of like
a Pantone pattern on the box hyaluronic
based blurring surface finish about
sounds good anything blurring is just
wonderful for my skin so let's have a
look oh how do you get into it can't
figure out how to get into it but to
keep looking out on the blog if you want
to know my first impressions of this
then I have another box here this oh it
says this in elvish inside so berry and
company let's have a little look what
I've been sent from Barry M ah this
looks really cute it's like a little
Easter bundle is so adorable I don't
know if I can get out the box I really
don't want to ruin it this is so
adorable it's like a little package very
eastery with some cute little tart and
not tart and check ribbon around it it
says berry and Easter Bunny and it's got
my name on it as well this is so cute oh
my gosh let's have a little look what is
inside all of this packaging is just
adorable another one brands do this it
just puts so much effort in and I just
oh I love it
oh my gosh some chocolate themed goodie
goodies to satisfy your sweet tooth this
Easter and then they've got a picture of
little bunny on there as well that is
too adorable oh my gosh that will
success follow me on instagram at buddy
m
bunny yes Perry M have got the bunny on
Instagram and they sent a little
selection of goodies followed inspired
by chocolate so I guess this is the most
chocolaty colored nail varnish and it's
the shade marker which is absolutely
gorgeous deafening in paper nails in
that in minutes and then a lipstick I
just love brownie Pink's as you guys
know and this one is number one six
eight
they've also popped in a brownie kind of
chocolate colored super soft eye crayon
now I absolutely love berry on my crowns
don't have a brown one is that's really
handy then we have I think this is a
black just a classic eye defining liquid
eyeliner and
a Kohl eyeliner and lip liner very high
Janna and some very dark brown almost
from the eye glitter so lovely for a
nice Easter Easter party weekend weekend
makeup look then we have some Easter
goodies there's these tiny little chicks
in there which just remind me of my
childhood like sticking them on the
cakes a little flower in there - couple
of daisies oh my god this is just too
cute and last but not least a packet of
mini eggs my absolute favorites so thank
you berry on this is absolutely adorable
such a lovely little Easter gift thank
you very much
okay we're onto the next bag of bits and
bobs now we've got another lovely blue
envelope this one does not say who it's
from let's have a look at what's inside
here you plz must spend so much money on
envelopes I probably have fantasy all
the packaging is but all these send outs
but I just love to court them so this is
from Topshop bTW I believe yes
introducing Topshop beauty denim nails
that's quite random and Topshop is
introducing six new polishes like the
jeans the collection offers a versatile
wardrobe of denim washed here's very
nice so then they've sent me a couple of
volute home - nail varnishes I'm not a
huge blue Nirvana shuara I'm also on my
toes and but this one I think can be
very nice with a 10 and then that one
would be quite a good one for the toes
this is Lukas and leave named after
their jeans leave on my favorite jeans
top totally jeans just the bet best fit
in the whole world cuz that's a really
cool idea from Topshop another snazzy
envelope this one or this one's from
Urban Decay I haven't actually got
anything from Urban Decay
quite a while so wonder they've launched
any new bits
is to have a look oh oh my gosh I think
there's a deuce in here
yes they've sent a plena SHhhh oh no
it's not finished it's the same kind of
boxes punish botanic lab immunity panics
and ginseng juice that's nice I'll put
that in the fridge and drink that later
and then a vitamin infused up very cover
veterans you guys so clever complexion
prep spray redness reducing pore
minimizing and oil absorbing sounds
wonderful
final envelope this one is from I think
this one is from Clarins actually I
recognize the address on the return
label let's have a look what is new
farmer Aaron's some very colorful serums
by the looks of it so we have three
little boxes from Clarins booster energy
booster detox and booster repair that's
all over the press release I have no
idea what these are boosters for your
skin character infancy artists skincare
launches three turbocharged formulations
it's often mean to measure bleach
solutions in real time oh my gosh this
is so clever so you add these to your
favorite face cream mask all foundation
wow that's amazing
so energy energizing care for fatigue
skin for late nights
oh my god this is so freaking clap and
then the repair one which is the blue
one that's good for weakened skin
sunburn that is genius oh my gosh I'm
you know how good this one is and then
the green one is for detox so that's the
pollution or partying or overindulgence
Wow Clarence you are such geniuses that
last summer I don't if you remember they
made the tanning booster drop so you add
a couple of drops into your moisturizer
and it mainly could use your favorite
moisturizer also get a tan so I guess
these are just amazing it adding a few
power ingredients to your skincare I
cannot wait to try these this is such an
exciting launch from cartons yay and
lastly from my peer box haul and the a
side carried my dawdle stuff home in
Sainsbury's bags because the guys at
dawdle we must have given me about a
million plastic bags in their time so
lastly I have a box and
obviously from fake bake because they
have fake fake masking tape very good
branding of you guys so let's see what
goodies I have been sent on fake bake so
you have quite a little selection of
pieces in here from fake bake oh my gosh
I think they just sent me an actual
coconut holy guacamole that is memento
they have that's crazy they've said I'm
coconut with a fake bake logo like
embossed into it that is so crazy
I don't know how they've done that but
that is actually mental I think they oh
my god that is crazy this that no
coconut opener as well so I have to
chisel through the coconuts against the
coconut milk is such a good idea oh my
gosh how tropical and also some paper
straws which look like bamboo shoots
this is such a good send out oh my god
every time I do it I swear these
periodic just think of such amazing
things oh yeah okay so this is the
product so it's their flawless tanning
serum with coconuts for face and body
and I'm sure in the email and the girls
said that it's the first fake tan to
include coconut hence the hence the
coconut so oh it says beauty bronzing
hybrid luxe golden bronze glowing
all skin tones I'm going to use this by
after this video because I'm super panel
