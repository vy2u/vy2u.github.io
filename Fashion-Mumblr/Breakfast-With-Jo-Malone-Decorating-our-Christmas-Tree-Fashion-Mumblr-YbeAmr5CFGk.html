log of us today is starting in the most
beautiful location I am in the thermal
own town house we are starting the day
with a festive breakfast here which I'm
so excited about german-owned always do
the most incredible Christmas events so
very excited for breakfast we've got
here a little bit early because we're
actually gonna take a few photos
tactically I thought I knew they were
going to be doing this place up so
fabulously they're gonna take some nice
Instagram snaps in my pretty party dress
first but as you can see it's all very
colorful in here got the kind of
Christmas trees colorful place settings
on the table and that is the theme for
the german-owned gifts this year I'll
quickly show you the gift sets the
German don't have Christmas because
they're absolute stunning and I
definitely would like to find one under
my Christmas tree
finished shooting at the beautiful
German alone townhouse it was a bit of a
dream
so because the townhouse was so
gorgeously decorated I actually shot
three different outfits in there which
was very very productive and April and I
are now having our team doing a little
bit of work outside the ivy cafe in
Marylebone which as you can see the
equipment yeah we are mad because fair
leg alert but it's so beautiful and
festive we wanted to get a more
effective Instagram photos so we're
going to do a little bit of work here
for now and then we are going to go on a
bit of a mission down Oxford Street to
find some repeat or gift wrap because
Christmas and give need a wrap in April
and I were just saying how impressed we
are with the day for curls that I
promise you I have not done anything to
me but I've not done anything well I
what what they did was they pinned the
curl as soon as it was done on top of my
head and let it cool down there which to
sex them and then every evening I've
been putting my hair in a bun which I
think further sets the curls so yeah had
this done four days ago at dry bike I'm
gonna have to wash it tonight because
this are not price a nice
but still going strong
very subtle flocking don't want to make
a big scene but a pretty good day today
we've now made our way to the Ritz which
is where I was last night
second we've got another little coffee
set up what is we are we basing
ourselves in the next hour also as you
may be out here there are some Christmas
Carol I'm going on it's just so festive
in here
okay so it's a little bit later on now
as you can hear we have got the
Christmas carols playing in the
background we are at home and Charlie
April and I have spent the whole
afternoon just working and working
getting loads of things done and a very
productive day now Charlie and I are
just getting the house ready to have a
couple of friends over for dinner we're
going to be doing a village of beef and
a mac and cheese both mine and Charlie's
specialities I've got my favorite
Christmas jumper on again you guys know
this record to death this jumper I've
worn it pretty much every day since I
got it and I also just popped on the new
lipstick which we had engraved last
night with our names on and I don't
usually wear red but I do quite like
this one so you know what you think but
I have to just show you how cute the
house is looking we don't have our
Christmas decorations up yet but we've
just lit some candles it looks really
nice and also the dogs have their
Christmas jumpers on so let me show you
this is Dickie wearing his Christmas
jumper do you like in my prints
Oh what about you Dexy are you looking
like a smarty pants oh we love Christmas
jumpers mommy
I'm jealous cuz you're not kissing me
anymore and then we've just got lots of
candles lit we've got the fireplace on
and then up here we've just made the
fireplace look a little bit festive with
some candles and some pinecones
hopefully we're gonna get a Christmas
tree tomorrow so it should be looking
even more festive very soon okay so
we're in the kitchen preparing the
evening meal we trying to find the
biggest dish possible mega mac and
cheese I'm about to also make my
signature Grey Goose espresso martini
cocktail so I'll show you very quickly
how I do so unfortunately I can't find
my cocktail shakers I'm gonna use one of
Charlie's Jim flasks for this so you
don't necessarily need a cocktail shaker
but what you are going to use to start
with is a cup of coffee so I've taken
that from an espresso machine so Beth
and Andy have arrived and they're
already acquainting themselves and look
you've got matching Joneses on as well
we're very trendy where you three look
like you're in a Christmas card oh my
god that is so funny that's all now
honey that is so cute
all right next up is one parts Gray
Goose to one and a half parts espresso
good morning Charlie and I are currently
power walking to the gym we have a 9:00
a.m. PT session right early on a
Saturday morning I'm decided to turn
this into a two day vlog because I don't
actually think I vlog that much
yesterday um so after the gym I'm going
to get my nails done with the girlies
and then I've got a lot of unboxing to
do and hurt me so oh yeah I'm Charlie
and I just bought a Christmas tree from
a chap on my street I'm cold red my
service automated I've run it through my
Jew distracted cicadas overloaded
careful don't pull the cord on
me
why a circus but you don't get that
courage cuz you can have
tries a puzzle I got to sober Buzzle cuz
you can fall into
from the gym and we have come to my
favorite new nail salon in Clapham and I
am with all of my girlies and over there
Vicki and Holly are getting their nails
done so we are having some nice mince
pies put some coffees so can I gonna get
patties done what are we gonna go yes
exactly
not too sure but we're having a little
bit of like a festive ecology here at
London Grace and we've got some
Christmas to play with it's trying to
pick our colours and do some a drink
Oh change
a waterhole
I
okay so I've just got back home after a
really really lovely morning so I've got
my toes done all beautifully I decided
to go for a coral color because we are
as you know going away in just a few
days which I'm so excited about they do
the best manis and pedis at London Grace
and throughout the festive season and I
think throughout the year you can book
in for a little private space in most of
their salons and have your friends
around have some champagne have some
coffees they'll even provide a little
mince pies or treats so highly highly
recommend it and generally just the best
mani-pedi place ever such amazing vibe
I will leave their link down below
highly recommend if you are ever in
London or if you live around here
just the best long-lasting amazing
money's so think you London grace for
hosting me and my pals this morning we
had just such a nice time and so good to
catch up with some pampering treatments
as well today now so Charlie's brother
George is about to come over and he is
going to be collecting some stuff that
we have donated to him like it our old
kettle old saucepan things like that
because they're moving in together
George and his girlfriend after
Christmas so we're giving them lots of
bits and bobs and I am going to also
attempt to tidy up this room I have so
many deliveries in here most of which
are Christmas decorations so I've
ordered from Anthropologie and John
Lewis in the Black Friday sales so what
I might do is just pop the camera up and
do a little bit of an unboxing okay so I
have this delivery here and actually I
already opened it this morning because I
really wanted to get this out of it and
it's a company called me plus em they
have the most amazing of loungewear so
as well as this gorgeous hoodie I will
show you what else I have so we have
this pair of tracksuit bottoms
I live in loungewear so it's nice to
have some really beautiful lounge wear
pieces these are the most gorgeous
material they feel really lightweight
but should be nice and toasty warm as
well as I've got those tracksuit bottoms
and also
this is probably the most dreamy piece
it is their gray cashmere hooded top
which is just such a luxury but I think
when you work at home and you spend a
lot of time in your loungewear it's
worth getting something really really
beautiful like this also for when you're
flying you want to look smart and
polished and but still be really cozy
so that is gonna be so so perfect for my
flight next week also for our trip I
have some goodies here from Clarins they
sent me they're truly waterproof mascara
which is literally the most waterproof
mascara ever it's so amazing for days on
the beach and then a couple of their Sun
creams I've got their factor 30 Sun
wrinkle cream for face and factor 50 as
well this is the best face Sun cream
it's anti-aging and it doesn't let you
get those little under skin blemishes
which you sometimes get in the Sun so
that's amazing thank you very much -
Clarins so this is a blogger mail from
bareMinerals they have put in very
kindly a top-up of my favourite
foundation the bear Pro I wear number 16
which is some stone and then also oh god
this is amazing the complexion rescue
which is a tinted gel cream and this
will be amazing for holiday I've got
this bag here for all the bits I'm gonna
take away with me this I think is too
thick for holiday there's something to
leave this one here oh wow
I know it's broken I think this well so
this is a very luxurious looking
moisturizer the ultimate diamond
transformative massage mask from Estee
Lauder unfortunately I think it's broken
a little bit in the packaging which is
such a shame there's like this stunning
mirrored tray that it's come with and
also okay I think this is like this is a
massage stone I think that might be
what's broken it unfortunately and then
this little golden spatula to apply that
sounds amazing and look at this
packaging that's so stunning my goodness
I definitely need to have a pamper
session this evening beautiful blogger
mail from Estee Lauder that is so
stunning I think this is another blogger
mail and to prepare me for my holiday
we have the weather system professional
shampoo and conditioner over there Sun
oil
luxurious hair protection that sounds
incredible and immediate Sun rescue I
guess that's like a creamy conditioner
but my hair needs all the rescuing it
can get our highways that's going to
come in very handy and then same PR
company has also sent I think it's also
Weller sealing cream nourishing sun
protection that sounds amazing
and the total of SPF his wind tunnel
protector this is amazing I just swear
by this so much so long-lasting
the anti-allergy sun sensitive skin
collection and the one day long-lasting
sun cream I love the smell of his brain
it always reminds me of the most amazing
holiday memories so thank you very much
for those I made a chunky vegetable soup
in the Thermomix
this is a mixture of rainbow carrots
pearl barley leek celery and I think
just onion and garlic looks delicious is
the recipe that I used I just didn't do
the chicken so this as I've mentioned
before is one of the cookie recipes
which is a snazzy item so let's dig in
hello again
so a quick confession I actually kind of
got to vlog for the rest of yesterday
the day that you saw me doing the
unboxing everything got a little bit
manic in the evening I basically found
out that my outfit for a pop stars fancy
dress party wasn't going to arrive on
time so I had to dash into town and pull
together a makeshift outfit and then I
was getting ready for that and then we
went out for the party I don't think I
filmed anything maybe one drink of
Charlie half dressed up like allergy if
so I'll be inserting it here yeah with
my friends party and it was pop stars
themed so I attempted to go as Jessica
Simpson just with things that were in my
wardrobe but to be honest I was a little
bit disappointed with my outfit I like
to make a big effort that fancy dress
parties so yeah I was a bit disappointed
with myself but was a really fun evening
today is Sunday and as you can see we've
got our tree in I have just put the
lights on it and Charlie's going to come
downstairs in a second and help me
decorate this jumper got a where
Christmas jumpers when you are
decorating your tree is actually a
Cancer Research one one of my Twitter
followers told me about this so if
that's you then thank you very much and
it's amazing it's like a traditional
Christmas jumper with a sausage dog on
that says dachshund through the snow so
definitely my favorite Christmas jumper
and it's the charity which makes it even
better I'm gonna leave a link to this
jumper down below if you know any other
sausage dog lovers or you just think
it's cute then it's a really good cause
as well so yeah Christmas jumpers on
we're going to spend the next 20 minutes
decorating the tree and then we're going
over to Charlie's mama dad's house for a
Sunday lunch which is just like a family
tradition my mom's gonna be there as
well which we really really lovely
that's first of all we are tree
decorating this is our collection of
baubles Charlie and I don't really like
to theme our tree we just like to pick
up baubles on various trips that we go
on like this is from when we went to
Amsterdam a couple of years ago this
little gingerbread house we got the
first year we moved into our house what
else what else
we obviously have this little one from
the year that we got Dexter it's a
little sausage dog that says Dexter on
it so that's what we're up to this
afternoon so I do actually want to get
this vlog published today as well so I'm
going to edit as much of this as I can
in the car to Charlie's mom and dad's
house and then hopefully get it up for
you a little bit later
