parts 11 I realized in the last tool
October's I've said completely the wrong
number I think I said eight when it was
nine and eight when it was 10 so yeah
got it right this time hopefully October
number eleven yeah I'm pretty sure
that's right so it is Tuesday today and
it's really early it's about half-past
seven in the morning and I'm heading out
now because I've got a breakfast meeting
the first thing at natural kitchen which
I'm really looking forward to because I
absolutely love natural kitchen been
there loads for lunch but I've never
been there for breakfast so looking
forward to that um and then just got a
really busy day in oh my voice went
really strange and and yes Ben just got
a really busy day in London not gonna be
home until much later so gonna miss this
little boy he was really naughty this
morning just running around and being
really hula Ganic while I was trying to
get my blog post live but that's done so
I'm gonna give you a quick outfit of the
day before I shoot it out the door um so
I think you've seen all of these pieces
before I'm just wearing a black Roenick
from Topshop Topshop she'll a which was
actually in the blog post that I
published this morning and then my skirt
which is suede one from Topshop got
black tights on and rest on Brahmi boots
and then I'm actually taking my mulberry
bag out with me today I haven't taken
this bag out in quite some time perform
in Switzerland and it kind of reminded
me how much I loved it and I spent so
much money on it that I really need to
get some aware of it so yeah heading out
now
so first meeting of the day is Donna
just had a really lovely breakfast at
the natural kitchen and with one of the
girls from Illamasqua and we had a
really nice catch up all things makeup
also my childhood Christmases and the
things mr. love when when it also it was
really nice
now I'm on my way to a breakfast event
so we're not going to eat again but
should we get fun it's with sand Ives
skincare and there's no pink evening
Chelsea's gonna be there so should
so just community force majeure which
the French restroom I am an economist
romantic
- artists
affection
so just come to Northland and I'm here
in a protest tutor as you might be able
to see I'm here for a sneak peek of the
collection 2016 photo shoot and I've
never been behind the scenes
affectionate process is really good fun
it's kind of a little bit like Fashion
Week but without all the madness is
actually really good fun so the girls
just finishing off their makeup now
speaking word I'm gonna give you a
little sneak peek into your collection
so here we've got the new primers and
they've got loads of different colors
depending on your skin tone I think this
one is one I'm most excited about so
this one's got an skincare in from the
witch so that's going to be a really
good multitasking primer and then these
over here are really cool I'm going to
show you it'll swatch off these eyebrow
powders so they're basically like an
eyeliner style pencil and then it comes
out in almost like a powder so I think
this is going to really great for super
speedy brows and the colors are really
lovely they've got a couple of quite
light blonde shades and the darker shade
as well which is pretty really lovely
and then this I think is my favorite
from the 2016 collection this is their
rose that nude rose eyeshadow palette
and I think this retails for under four
pounds which is crazy and they're really
similar shades to the naked 3 so I think
that's going to be pretty nice everyday
I shadow palette and they've also got a
more purpley one and kind of gloomy gray
palette as well and then some lovely
lipsticks and I am allowed to swatch
these as well so I'll show you what
these ones
so I just watched these m3 and these
results you can see they're really sheer
but really nice kind of autumnal colors
bicycles will be really good for
springtime very kind of Kylie Jenner
news type shade
