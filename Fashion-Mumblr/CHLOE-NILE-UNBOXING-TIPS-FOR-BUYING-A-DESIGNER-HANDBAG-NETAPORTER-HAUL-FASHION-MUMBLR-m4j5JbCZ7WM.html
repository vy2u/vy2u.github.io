joining me for today's video which is
going to be a Chloe Niall bag unboxing
it's been a long time since I did an
unboxing video
I really enjoyed showing you my Gucci
dialysis unboxing which is about this
time last year and I thought I would do
the same for my newest handbag purchase
I have been thinking about the Chloe now
bag for a really long time I first saw
it on fellow bloggers and youtubers
probably like eight or nine months ago
and originally didn't really think it
was a bag that I needed but the more I
keep seeing it whether it's on friends
or on youtube or on Instagram at the
more I just can't stop thinking about it
so I've finally given in and treated
myself to one I've actually never seen a
Chloe Niall bag in the flesh in real
life before only ever in photos or from
afar so this is going to be a real first
impressions for you guys I went to
Selfridges in Manchester last weekend on
bank hood day and I really wanted to see
one and potentially buy one there and
then get the whole retail experience and
the thrill of buying in store but they
didn't have any in stock and the gnar
bag is notoriously really hard to find
which is why I ended up picking it up
from online I bought it from net Porter
and I have the box here I'm going to
open it and show you what's inside right
so this is the box obviously the Chloe
Niall is quite a small handbag and there
is more than just a handbag in here I
may quickly whiz through the rest of
these pieces at the end of the video but
also in this video as well as the
unboxing I'm going to sharing a few tips
on how to buy and how to care for a
designer handbag so stay tuned for that
but for now let's rummage through and
find handbags so this actually confuses
me a bit because sometimes when you buy
from their supporter you get the box of
the bag and which I kind of expect from
them spending that amount of money but
this time it's just coming the dust bag
probably to save space but either way
the Box probably would just get thrown
away anyway so I'm not too bothered so
this is the dust bag that it comes in
and the bag the color that I've got what
you may be surprised is this beauty what
you think
oh it's right
it's not pink it's not white it's not
cream it is burgundy or ox blood I'm not
sure the official color it doesn't say
anything on here but this is this color
that I've gotten for style and this one
is of course a bag with a bracelet style
clasp and it has got the over shoulder
strap as well so obviously this is a
really small hand bag so as far as an
everyday home becos it's probably not
gonna be the right kind of bag for that
however this kind of handbag is more of
a way to elevate your outfit in autumn
it's definitely going to be a statement
piece
this whole ring bracelet design is so
iconic it's really recognized that Chloe
design it is of course really highly
duped
so that could potentially put you off
investing in something like this but
also I do find that dupes are a great
way of experimental in style if you
purchase a dupe you can really see how
it works in your outfit how it works
your wardrobe to see if you do want to
invest in at the real deal which is what
I've done in this case I have a kind of
mango dupe that has a ring on it and I
absolutely adored that style I really
wanted this back for autumn which is why
I went for this oxblood color I think
this will just fit seamlessly with my
autumnal wardrobe with those dark colors
but also if I wear a lighter outfit
it'll really be a bold statement popping
color as well the main kind of material
on this bag is of course leather and
then at the side here you've got this
suede band running through at the back
there is a little pocket so if like me
you're always struggling to find your
oyster card you can just pop it in the
back and it's really easy to get to
things like that could slip your phone
in there but having said that you're not
really gonna lose anything I bagged this
size it is so miniscule inside it has
got stuffing it has got the information
or as I say Seanna reg that so funny
Aris got back from Santa oh my goodness
and then you've got the guarantee and
the quality information and then it's
just one big pocket inside and this tiny
little oak pocket you can put again any
cards or anything in it I'm gonna check
whether my iPhone actually fits in this
because I have an iPhone 7 plus I
tweeted a couple of days before actually
purchasing there saying does anyone know
if the iPhone 7 plus fits inside the
Chloe Niall and no one was able to give
me a definitive answer so let's try it
out don't under
I think it's going to oh my gosh oh well
it does but you're not really gonna fit
that much more in there God she had to
put the phone in there slightly
diagonally if you had a really big bulky
case like one of those battery pack
cases you might really struggle to be
honest I think that it might actually
stretch the bag a little bit if I was to
put my phone and my vlogging camera in
now as you can see it's really taken up
the entire back space of the bag I'd say
I probably ought to fit my card my card
wallet lipstick just about my vlogging
camera and a couple of other essentials
in there as well but really not too much
extra room I got the feeling that when I
first discovered this bag it was around
the 750 price mark don't quote me on
that but I definitely don't think it was
over the thousand pound bracket and this
was this was 105 v so just over that
thousand pound boundary I do wonder if
the mass availability of dupes has
driven that price up because of the
demand for this style of handbag and
because of the amount of dupes as well
it certainly has given this bag almost
iconic status and hopefully if that
reason it'll remain a classic handbag
for many years to come
which is what I really look for when I
do invest in a handbag I don't want to
go for something straight away when it
first comes out until I'm sure there's
going to be a long lasting trend because
it is definitely an investment piece
when it comes to styling this bag up
I've noticed that you can actually
unclip these little straps here so you
could wear it by itself just as like a
bracelet bag or you can wear it over the
shoulder and this also is adjustable too
so you can wear it all the way crossbody
just over one shoulder quite a few
different ways to style this handbag I
guess you could dress it up or down for
day or evening depending on whether you
want to wear it with a strap or not
leather wise as well it's a kind of
level that's not going to scratch it too
easily and because it is that dark color
there shouldn't be any color rubbing or
fading if you wear it with dark denim
which is something that you do have to
consider when looking at lighter
handbags so on that note and I'm going
to give a few tips on what I look for
when buying a designer handbag and a few
tips on caring for designer bags too so
my first tip would be all around
choosing which designer handbag you want
to treat yourself to especially if it is
your first designer handbag my personal
opinion is that I like to go for a bag
that I know
to get so much wear out of having said
that I do have friends that like to
really save up and cherish their
designer handbags they want to choose
one that they can use on special
occasions and always get that kind of
fluttering butterfly feeling when they
wear it just like a brand new handbag
every single time but if like me you
want to get tons of price per wear then
I would say to look at your current
handbag collection and look at the bags
that you wear the most often is your
everyday handbag a really big bucket bag
and you just want to be able to chuck
everything into it in that case maybe
look at something like the Louis Vuitton
never full or a bag like my Saint
Laurent handbag because then you know
you're going to get tons and tons of use
out of it and then bring it that price
per wear down and down to make it a
really good investment piece but then on
the other hand if you did want a bag
that is going to be just really special
some you can really cherish then perhaps
slip with something that's going to be
an evening bag it really depends on your
school of thought and what you want to
get from not design a handbag if you
guys happen to have watch mine how to
look expensive video you'll have heard
me speak a great length about why I
really do believe that investing in a
designer handbag is a great way to
invest in your wardrobe as a whole it
really helps to elevate every single
outfit you can dress from the high
street you can dress from premium high
street stores and just by adding that
statement designer accessory it gives
you a whole look a more luxurious feel
so definitely check that video out for
more of those kind of ideas and how to
make your look look more expensive
overall but personally that's why I like
to invest in handbags as opposed to
really expensive coats or really
expensive shoes so I think they do make
the greatest statement and have the
biggest impact on your outfit as a whole
one thing that I always always think
about when looking for a new designer
handbag and equally and especially
important if you're looking at your
first designer handbag is the
timelessness of the design so you don't
necessarily want to invest all of your
hard-earned money in something that's
going to be out of style in a few months
or even in a few years so for me I look
for things that have already been in
store for quite a long time you don't
want things they're just going to be a
sudden trend and then disappear off the
radar you want to make sure that
something really does have lasting power
and is going to be fashionable for many
years to come so for that reason I
recommend looking at timeless shapes
classic materials classic colorways and
classic designs so things like again at
the Louie Vuitton never full is a really
good example for that the
Donna says I think that we are going to
see this as a trend bag for many more
seasons to come
and also it's for that reason that I did
wait a little bit longer before treating
myself to the Chloe Nile but now that I
recognize this trend does have longevity
I thought there was at the exact right
time to invest if you don't think they
are going to want to keep your designer
bag forever and ever then it's also
quite important to think about the
resale value personally I've never
actually be sold on any of my handbags I
love them all so much and they all hold
important memories for me that I choose
not to resell them but that is something
this to bear in mind a few brands in
particular like Chanel for example they
hold their value incredibly well and in
fact sometimes increase in value so you
can actually invest in these handbags
and earn even more money back on your
purchase that is quite rare but also
something to consider when investing in
a handbag if reselling is something that
it's important to you and you want to
have that option but also just to make
your bags look their best for as long as
possible then carry if your bag is
really really important so with that in
mind I'll talk a little bit about this
one so for example it's raining today I
wouldn't go out somewhere start
protecting it it's got suede on it and
it is leather so I would immediately
protect this bag go to somewhere like
Timpson or even Russell and Romney they
have a very very good suede and leather
spray mist it from a few centimeters
away just to make sure your entire bag
is protected if you have a suede handbag
or a suede section on your handbag this
is even more important just gives you a
little bit longer before any water will
penetrate your handbag so you have a few
more moments to wipe off any spillages
or any rain just to make sure your
material stays in the best possible
condition for as long as possible when
choosing your handbag really really
important to look at the fabrics you
want something really hard wearing
something that's not going to pick up
scratches on that note the fabric of the
bag or the material of the bag is such
an important thing to consider when
investing in a handbag you want to get
material that's very strong very
hard-wearing and not something that's
going to get damaged stained or scratch
very easily so a few of the materials I
recommend in particular would be
Saffiano leather if you are familiar
with Michael Kors bags a lot of those a
Saffiano leather it's kind of like a
scratchy leather and it's very hard
wearing doesn't really get scratched
fairly water-repellent as well on that
note
faux crocodile leather or embossed
leather which has a crocodile effect
like my new singer on Sunset Berg that's
also really hard wearing and very hard
to scratch or damage to obviously darker
colors are a lot more versatile hard
wearing - lighter color bags sometimes
do suffer from a little bit of color
transfer when I used to work at Mulberry
sadly we got so many complaints about
like hug based waters light-colored
leather because if you're a fan of
wearing darker jeans or black jeans dark
denim you do sometimes get a little bit
of rubbing and transfer I know that the
Gucci darkness is in the pale suede a
lot of people are really upset that
there's suddenly a really dark Navy
patch on the back where it's been
rubbing against our trousers and it does
absorb the dye from your denim so that's
something to be very wary of especially
if you do wear lots of dark colored
jeans this I don't even get any color
transfer at all so a very practical
color material wise this one as I said
shouldn't scratch too much but if you do
want to get a softer leather I would try
to steer away from that really spongy
leather because you only need to walk
past a thistle or something and it will
really scratch the handbag so definitely
something to be very wary of hardware as
well as something to consider firstly
the color and secondly how much there is
of it you need to think about the
accessories that you wear what colors
watch what color is your favorite belt
and is it going to go or is it going to
clash secondly hardware does of course
over time tarnish especially if you get
a lot of use out of your bags which you
want to but having said that a lot of
designers will actually replace the
hardware free of charge or at a very
reduced cost if it does become tarnished
my first Mulberry bag I wore day in day
out every single day in my face water
and the postman lock got very scratched
very damaged they actually replaced that
for me even though it was over two years
since I purchased the bag if you're
going into a store to pick up your new
designer bag purchase and of course an
obvious thing that I'm going to
recommend is checking your bag over a
lot of the time you'll be able to see
one on the shop floor and actually I'll
see assistant to bring you a brand new
one from the back that's the best option
but whether you're going to do that or
pick one up from the shop floor it's
always so important to double-check your
bag
you want to check it inside and out make
sure there's no scratches on the leather
obviously now there's natural materials
there's going to be a few differences
between like the grain and any any marks
actually within the leather but
scratches are a big
something you definitely want to check
for also check the Zips to the opening
close where you smoothly check the
hardware check there's no scratches on
there and also check the lining just to
make sure it's perfectly clean and
undamaged if you do find any
imperfections it is always worth asking
for a discount I know I keep talking
about robbery but when I did get my
first Bayswater it was the last one in
that color in the store I've desperately
wanted it but there was a little mark on
the postman lock I think they've got
about 5 or 10% discount for that and
personally the scratch was almost
invisible to the eye but I managed to
spot it and we did get a very small
discount for that so always worth
checking and definitely worth asking for
a discount so once you've got your
lovely new handbag home and you want to
keep it in the best condition possible
of course you want to store it in a way
that's going to protect it and keep it
looking its best for longest I would
always recommend keeping the dust bag
when you are just storing it for a few
days to time stuff the dust bag into the
bag and then if you're going to be
storing it for a long period of time
like for example my donor says I'm going
to be getting it out of storage very
soon it's a really old terminal bag I've
got I think I've actually got old tights
inside it to make it hold its shape and
then it's within its dust bag but just
make sure that you do stuff it with
something whether it's I don't know
whether it's some tissue paper or socks
depending on the size of the bag make
sure you do pop something inside there
because the leather if you're going to
be storing it for weeks or even months
it could start to lose its shape and
then keep it out of the sunlight in
somewhere it's room temperature away
from any moisture and all of these
things will help it to look it's best
for as long as possible so I think
that's pretty much everything all the
wisdom that I have to impart when it
comes to choosing a new designer handbag
so I'm gonna pop this down i've been
clutching it for dear life while i've
been explaining my handbag tips and it's
very quickly run through the other bits
and bobs in my net reporter box because
i know you guys have tell me off if i
didn't so let me show you what else i
have picked up okay so no particular
order bearing in mind that I'm going to
Positano and the Sorrento at the weekend
I'm so excited this is all kind of with
that trip in mind so this first one is a
blouse is it Zimmermann and I think this
is oh this is a brand called Place
Nacional definitely has a few
similarities to the top that I'm wearing
right now it has
same kind of sleeve style this almost
like a trumpet sleeve but it's more I'd
say more suitable for some holidays it's
a really lovely like cotton material I
think it may be as a Spanish brand
hundred percent cotton Oh made in Latvia
interesting I believe I saw this on
Julia from garments glam and I'm just
obsessed with everything in her wardrobe
or maybe she had a dress from this brand
either way I saw this on someone
absolutely fell in love with it and I
thought it would look beautiful on my
upcoming trip maybe the denim shorts or
even jeans you could definitely style up
jeans or something like this big fan of
the embroidery and kind of retreat on
base style that's the first piece and
then this is oh a lot bigger than I
thought it was going to be it looks
stunning on the model it is a dress a
very short dress hopefully it's not
going to be too short on me and this is
from the same brand but it's a size of 2
I'm guessing they go down to a size of
one so maybe I need to trade this for a
smaller size but we'll give that a try
then we have a piece from Zimmermann I
think I actually got two parts to this
there you have the matching shorts on
top I thought I could wear them together
or separately and just - absolutely
beautiful pieces I actually have a pair
of Topshop shorts which has a very
similar kind of styling to this but I
learned so much and I couldn't stop
thinking about the Zimmerman version the
fit on these looks absolutely beautiful
I have ordered a pair of simmerman
shorts in the past but ended up sending
them back for whatever reason and I
remember that the fit was absolutely
beautiful
I love wearing white shorts in the
holiday think they just look so gorgeous
so they picked up those and then this is
the matching top it's fairly sheer the
embroidery kind of broderie anglaise
style it has a lot of holes in it so I'm
going to have to be very conscious as to
what I wear underneath but just so I was
so beautiful feminine excited to get
those right this is something quite
random you may not expect me to pick up
from net supporter but it is a Nike
sports hoodie as we get into winter I
always look something really cozy to
wear to the gym I don't really do too
many outdoor workouts but I want to look
sporty and warm on our way to the gym
it's about a 15 20 minute walk or so I
pick this up for that reason it's it's a
hoodie it's got a very high neck so it
should be nice and cozy but it is that
really read your material so I could
probably wear this for a warm-up if I so
desired
next up is a Tory Burch bikini and I
have
say I think this is probably other than
the bag my favorite piece from at this
hall it is this band Oh Star bikinis
strapless and for small chested gals
definitely the way forward
and I really like the smoking detail on
this as well just means that it fits
beautifully and just add all this kind
of orange embroidery should look really
fab on that iconic Orange umbrella
Positano Beach already thinking about
those in snaps and then the matching
bottoms they do have quite a small
bottom on the bottoms which I always
find really really flattering and they
look like they should be really comfy
and great shape - thank you for giving
now - right then we have another sport
top this one is from Nike as well I
thought I'd get a lot of use out of this
I have a few white sweaty Betty tops in
rotation that I just wear over my sports
bras over and over again thought it was
time something new and just loved the
color of this one it's got these gray
almost sheer straps at the back just
other than that quite a plain sports top
and last but not least and this one has
come in its own little suit cover I
picked up this dress from zuman again a
real treat to myself before this
upcoming trip I thought it was a really
nice kind of so much autumn dress I can
imagine wearing this with my new coat
Susanna boots which by the way I'm just
obsessed with really happy I got them in
the taupe color if you haven't seen me
styling them up yet I'll put a picture
somewhere on the screen here but I
thought they would look fabulous with
this as well so it is little shorts as
opposed to being an open dress and for
me I actually prefer that so it means
you can get around something a little
bit shorter and it's not going to be too
revealing but it's the color and the
pattern that I absolutely fell in love
with I think it's going to be so
versatile and really looking forward to
stylist up a lot more in autumn print
itself is almost like kind of English
garden you've got lots of roses lots of
pretty flowers and then this little
waist detail that comes Rawdon at the
waist and make it really beautiful
silhouette you've got really rough cut
edges and the same kind of rough cut
filling around there which is very very
pretty very feminine but hopefully very
versatile for the coming of cooler
months so that's everything that I
picked up from that reporter a few
really pretty bits and bobs as well as
the handbag and I'm excited to give
everything a try so yeah I hope you guys
