me for today's video I'm going to be
sharing with you my top ten cold-weather
fashion essentials so I was going to do
one video which was going to be my top
10 fashion and beauty essentials but I
had so many to talk about that I'm going
to split this into two so if you'd like
to hear my top 10 cold-weather beauty
essentials and make sure you're
subscribed because that video I'll be
coming away very very soon and I've got
some really nice like cold-weather
beauty hacks in there as well so that
should be really fun one but today I'm
going to be talking through the pieces
that I think are cool pieces for your
wardrobe for when the weather starts to
get a little bit colder I've got my top
ten a few options for each a few
different price points so whether your
budget is appropriate for some really
luxurious pieces all you'd rather stick
to high street pieces then I have got an
option for you as always everything be
linked down the description box so if
you want to find out more or purchase
any of these pieces then you can click
show more for all of the details so
without further ado let's get started
and my number one is a classic chunky
knit I thought I would mention this one
that I'm wearing now this is one I've
been reaching for so much lately
and when it comes to chunky knits I
definitely advise going for a neutral
color because they will go with so many
outfit combinations you can even wear
them over a dress if you've got a quite
a wintery themed dress or of course with
skirts midi skirts look fantastic with a
chunky knit I did a blog post recently
on how to be cozy and comfortable but
also chic and I paired a Marks &amp;amp; Spencer
chunky knit with a midi skirt and that's
a really lovely outfit combination and
then of course the classic chunky knit
and jeans you can't really go wrong and
importantly you can also layer
underneath I did actually do last week
an entire video on how to layer for the
colder seasons so if you missed that I
will leave that linked up here and down
below as well so yeah this is my first
chunky knit this one is from Topshop
nice big collar detail which is so nice
for snuggling up in and then I also
really like these slightly trumpet style
sleeves I think they just add quite nice
design element to the junka a couple
more that I think are really really
lovely this one is something a little
bit different this one is also from
Topshop you've got this button detail on
the shoulder and I love the neckline of
this one it's like a slit at the top so
it's two sections of fabric button
together and I think it's just a really
lovely classic for very very feminine
style
something a bit different to the usual
chunky net and then my third chunky knit
this one is actually also from Topshop a
Topshop hat trick and this one is
incredibly warm it's a really thick
chunky knit I really like this
asymmetric sash detail what goes down
the middle there and because this has a
mohair and we'll mix blended in with the
man-made fibers it just makes it very
snuggly and warm what is great about all
three of these jumpers is you can get
away with wearing a thermal underneath
because of the nice high neckline and
that brings me nicely on to my second
cold weather fashion essential you guys
are probably bored of hearing me talking
about thermals but I honestly could not
recommend them enough I don't have one
to show you because they are all in the
wash and I'm not going to show you a
dirty thermal but I wear them as after
obviously my underwear they are always
the next layer that I wear during the
colder months as soon as it becomes like
October I always have one on my favorite
ones are from Marks and Spencers as you
probably know if you've seen me rambling
about cold-weather fashion before but
yeah sorry I don't have one to show you
but I like these scoop-neck long-sleeve
ones they're really thin they don't add
any bulk to your outfit and they keep
you so toasty I will leave my favorite
ones link down below I suggest you get a
white one a black one a grey one and
then there are some snazzy colors as
well but the white ones are the best
because they go into everything and they
don't show through cold weather
essential number three is a scarf and I
have three different options to talk
about I'm going to start with the most
premium option and this is a scarf that
not only obviously is functional but it
is a real style staple to your winter
outfit a scarf is one piece is always on
show so I do think that it's a great
investment piece and also if you do love
to make your look a little bit more
premium then by investing in something
like this which is a Burberry scarf this
was actually a Christmas gift from my
mum last year and I adore it and so
excited to wear it again this year
I got the one with the hearts on which
hopefully is still available if not I'll
leave this year's alternative link down
below by investing in something like
this it makes your whole outfit look a
lot more premium even when the only
designer thing from your outfit might be
your scarf so that is my number one
number two is a classic chunky knit
scarf this one is from accessorized so a
lot more affordable alternative and it
has these cute little pom-poms on it
other than the pom-poms it's just quite
a classic piece really nice long scarf
and a great thickness so it means
you really can wind it around several
times I'd like to do a little not as
well something like that not best but
you get the picture and it just keeps
you so snuggly and warm so I love this
one from accessorize and then a scarf
style that I think looks amazing
especially worn overcoats and if you
have a coat I'll show an example in a
second that has a tie waist this type of
scarf or some may say it's a faux fur
stole looks fabulous I like to wear this
over jumpers as well if I just want a
little bit more warmth from coziness but
if you do want to have that very
feminine silhouette then cinch it in at
the waist with a belt and that's a
really really lovely style this one
again is from Topshop I had one from
Reese last year that I wore loads and
loads in a pink color but when I saw his
classic white creamy one which does have
kind of flex of so luxurious and premium
I knew I had to have this in my winter
wardrobe and I've already worn this
absolutely loads so highly recommend
this one and from Topshop so another
fairly obvious one but of course a
cold-weather essential is a coat and
specifically a long coat and one which
also has a lining because then the
lining and hopefully a wool outer will
keep you very warm and protect you
against the wind which is so important
often it's not only the temperature but
the bitly cold winds which do get your
body very cold and woolen coat a long
coat and one with the lining would be my
three ticklish things to look out for
this is one from Rhys it does have the
waist belt which gives a very beautiful
feminine silhouette which I really love
Rhys when it comes to coats are just the
Masters they are tailored so beautifully
they fit the body incredibly and for a
very premium high street retailer I
don't think that too badly priced I
would recommend to everybody to invest
in a Rhys coach I've never regretted any
of the money I've spent on research
where and I do have quite a few pieces
from them because they do last season
after season I have this coat in
Burgundy that I purchased two years ago
I've got G leis from Rhys that I've got
from many years ago and I used to work
there and all of them are such classic
pieces that they were well worth the
investment of course my everyone wants
to spend that amount of money on as
where and don't worry because the high
street has some amazing options this one
I've been wearing loads recently and it
is from River Island a very classic coat
and it does have a detachable fur collar
so actually you can save yourself from
buying the Topshop style
just buy this coat and then you can
unbutton the fur bit from this and adapt
your outfit so there's a little a little
hack for you but this coat I do love to
wear with the faux fur collar attached
if you've seen any of my vlogs lately
you'll know that I have been living in
this coat and whenever I wear I get so
many compliments on it and actually for
the high street it is slightly more
pricey this is ninety pounds but it is
more affordable than the Reese ones and
I think it's a kind of coat that makes a
beautiful statement in your wardrobe and
you'll wear all winter long the newest
coat from my collection is this one is
from a brand called chichi London it's a
beautiful light pink color which as you
guys know is my absolute favorite shade
this one also has a waist belt but it's
quite a boxy fit this is quite a
masculine fit one and what I love about
this one is it's great for layering
especially over chunky knits whereas my
ones which have a slightly more feminine
silhouette are not quite so good
over big fat chunky knits you often feel
a little bit wedged in whereas this is a
lot more roomy so it doesn't have that
tailoring around the bodice I'll
probably also wear this one just over my
shoulders it's quite casual style and it
also has this lovely kind of Cape detail
at the back which I always think looks
really really beautiful again this one
is a high street price tag too so really
good value for your money
a very glamorous one next and my next
cold weather fashion essential is a pair
of thermal socks so these I think are
actually from Primark they have a
metallic thread running through them
which looks like glitter but it actually
acts to keep the warmth into your feet
which as I'm sure you know is very
important during the colder months
especially if you live somewhere where
the ground is IC or frosty then your
feet can get very chilly thermal socks
don't cost much at all
Primark Topshop everywhere seems to have
them so definitely pick up a few pairs
for something a little bit more
luxurious very warm very cozy and an
amazing present idea gift idea
these are cashmere socks from the white
company they're technically in bed socks
but I also like to wear them in wellies
if I know I'm going to be out for a long
time the cashmere as a natural fiber is
very warm very insulating and very soft
and cozy on the feet too so nice treat
for yourself but an even nicer stocking
filler or gift for a loved one on that
note a Footwear fashion essential for
the cold weather season would be a pair
of practical walking boots these are my
current favorite sale from Russell and
Bromley they're flats which means that
they're just great
for everything that great when it's icy
when it's frosty no slipping around
because they've got a really great
practical soul inside they have got a
shilling material so just ultra snuggly
and as you would expect from Ross and
Bromley they're absolutely beautiful as
well so you don't need to sacrifice your
style points when it comes to comfort
and practicality because these just tick
all of the boxes so I was meant to
mention this one when I talked about
coats but I forgot but this one is not a
long coat although I believe there is a
long version of this but this is a puff
of style coat I think it's got a down
lining which is so consciously warm and
then it packs down into a very small
size as well this is great as like a
nipping about kind of coat it's perfect
for I wear this going to the gym if
you're nipping out to the shops or if
you're going on like a long dog walk or
that kind of thing you cannot get
anything warmer than a thermal and a
chunky knit and then a Down coat and
this one this one is Ted Baker and it is
my favorites so so beautiful it also has
a waist belt which is on this big thick
elastic band and that really cinches in
the waist to give you that very feminine
figure despite all the chunky layers
underneath so I just thought I would
sneak this one in as a little bonus
number my next cold-weather essential is
a jumper dress and I also featured these
as part of your autumn basics for your
wardrobe and I think that even when the
temperatures really do drop you can
still get away with wearing a jumper
dress sometimes you're even too cold to
pull on a pair of jeans you just want to
be super snuggly and a jumper dress it
does exactly that what I like to do on
really cold days is where you guessed it
my long-sleeve thermal thermal tights as
well Marks and Spencers do great thermal
tights and I like to tuck my thermal top
into the tights and then you're just
totally covered your entire body is
covered which is amazing and then you
add something chic and stylish over the
top this is my most worn jumper dress of
the autumn and so far winter season
river island with balloon sleeves
absolutely love this one and then this
is a new purchase I got this one a
couple of days ago from Zara it's a
black jumper dress with pearls on it I
thought that if you have to wear black
for work this would be a really nice one
and I think it's already really nice
jumper dresses I don't like the shopping
experience and Zara as I've mentioned
before but you can't deny they do have
some really nice pieces
this with like ankle boots and black
thermal tights would be a winning winter
outfit combination to go with your
jumper dress I think there is nothing
better than a pair over knee boots and
you guys must be sick to death of seeing
these because I talk about them so much
but I absolutely adore them and
recommend them to absolutely everyone
these are my Karen Millen great over the
knee boots they were an investment piece
but already the price per wear is next
to nothing because I have worn them so
so so much which you'll know if you've
watched previous videos or follow me on
Instagram etc etc I just absolutely
adore them they do keep your legs warm
as well because of course cover you up
to over the knee heel height wise these
are super practical I would be
comfortable wearing these on frosty icy
days the highly highly highly recommend
these if you haven't already treated
yourself to them then I suggest you do
so but I do have again an affordable
alternative this is a pair of brown over
the knee boots from brand attic these
retail for under 40 pounds so an
incredible incredible buy the heel is a
little bit higher but I do still find
them very comfortable for wearing all
day because it's a chunky heel and your
foot is nicely protected with all this
structure around the ankle area I
actually wore the black versions of
these four full decks flowing around
Boston and I think we racked up around
20,000 steps and it was still very
comfortable so don't let the heel height
put you off also what I love about these
ones in particular and I have tried a
lot of affordable high street boots is
that these ones don't slip down the leg
they have a tie at the back here and
they don't have slippery material inside
so it's not satiny it's like a cotton
material so it helps to grip the leg and
they don't slide down you don't get
baggy material around your ankles so as
far as affordable over knee boots go
these ones from brand attic which also
come in black would be my number one
recommendation another cold-weather
fashion accessory that I recommend that
you have in your collection is a lovely
pair of gloves and I know that sounds
quite obvious but how many of us have
drawers full of gloves and yet we don't
actually put them in our handbags and
you use them if you treat yourself to a
really lovely pair that are just a
really lovely addition to your outfit as
well as something practical then
hopefully you'll get a little bit more
use out of them I recently treated
myself to these I actually bought two
pair one for myself and one for a friend
as a Christmas gift and they are from
Anthropologie I thought they were
cashmere because of the quite high price
tag but actually they're acrylic
polyester and wool
but actually that's probably a really
lovely warm combination I'm not sure if
you can see but they have really lovely
pearl detail on them and then on the
fingers they have a special kind of
knitted section which means you can
still use your phone or importantly when
the weather is cold so you don't have to
take your gloves off risk dropping it in
some snow or ice you can do all you need
to do on your phone with these gloves on
which is amazing so these are my current
favorite when it comes to winter gloves
and my final recommendation is a pair of
ear muffs now I was going to say hat and
I do love hats but I'm yet to find one
that I absolutely love this season there
is a really cute pink beanie hat with
two like pom-pom ears on it from Topshop
which I'm tempted but I am I actually
like to wear my hair up a lot I wear my
hair in a ponytail a lot or in a bun is
very rare that I actually have my head
down I'm having a very rare good hair
day today and so for that reason I
prefer am ups for me it is my ears that
get the coldest so for me to have
something that I can pop on no matter my
hairstyle like so it's just a really
lovely way of keeping warm and looking
chic as well I love these ones with the
Pearl on the headband they are from Kate
Spade there are also some really lovely
ones with like a blush pink pom-pom in
Topshop at the moment but I'll link the
Topshop ones as well as these ones down
in the description box

essentials I really hope you enjoyed
