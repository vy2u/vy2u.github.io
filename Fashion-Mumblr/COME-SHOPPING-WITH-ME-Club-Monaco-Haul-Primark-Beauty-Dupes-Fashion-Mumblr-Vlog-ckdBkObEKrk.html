someone in a little while and doing
quite a few different things today I
thought would take you guys along with
me don't have time to chat around too
much right now because I've got a
doctor's appointment in 13 minutes going
to get hopefully my injections for India

signed up this GP so hopefully they'll
be able to do my original check and then
give me the jabs fingers crossed or kind
of hyped myself up for the injections
this morning and I've worn clothing that
I can remove easily as so yeah fingers
crossed I'm going to get my injections
over and done with Charlie's getting his
later on a day um I've got really light
makeup on because I'm then getting a
facial so that's a really nice way to
reward myself after the injections I'm
going to liz'll on don't know if you
call it the Duke of York Square just you
know that kind of area behind Peter
Jones yeah on Kings Road basically in
Chelsea I'm going to have a little
facial and I'm so excited about it as
you guys know it's one of my favorite
skincare brands of all time so yeah
light makeup and then I've got a lunch
meeting and I've also got to return some
samples to a PR showroom these Furla
bags that I photographed in Barbados

because we're looking after mums dogs
Coco and Lily there's big fat you loo

the doctors I'm gonna get going I'll see
you guys shortly
okay I survived my thyroid vaccinations
and I've got to go to the chemists to
pick up a hepatitis A vaccinations it's
all very confusing I totally do not
remember it being this hard last time I
got a load of jazz I'm now at Kings Road
about my coffee and I've got about 15
minutes until my little facials I'm
going to pop in of Monaco because I am
literally uncapable of walking past that
shop and not going in and it's such a
beautiful day it's that perfect winter
day blue skies and crisp cool weather
but not too cold so yeah let's have a
little look what they've got in store
I'm gonna go try not to break the bank
and then I'm so excited with the facial
injection didn't hurt but I just feel
like a little bit of relaxation never
did anything
coming just taking my
oh my goodness
just has a tear myself away from club
Monaco to come and make sure I'm on time
with my facial but did you guys see that
people jumper oh my goodness I think I'm
going to go back afterwards and try it
on because I feel like that is the most
me jumper in the entire world so almost
it lives are now in the beach would you
give York square in the treatment room
11 strip off about to get into the bed
which is all cozy the heat blanket
Abigail's just saying that she designed
this room because she's much their
living therapist it's so beautiful I'm
going to get undressed and enjoy the
blissful patient
excuse my makeup nurse face I have just
mastermind lives el facial and as I
thought it would be it was pure heaven
my first impressions always really good
when they tuck you into a bed instead of
you just having a towel on you so I was
very grateful to be pretty much snuggled
or cocooned up into a little duvet and
then Abigail started by cleaning my face
pens and polish but that was unlike any
commencement for experience I've ever
given myself it was so relaxing and then
she used a couple of masks and yeah it
was just at sea heavenly and I now smell
incredible
I picked up a couple of goodies from the
store as well and also very good
I also briefly went back into Club
Monaco to get that jumper some has time
to try there because I've got a meeting
at one o'clock in about 20 minutes so
it's going to get the bus to off the
street
hey guys so it's about an hour since I
last chatted to you since then I've been
to a couple of meetings and I also just
went into Primark that pink bag is one
of those like canvas bags and I just go
inside seen quite a few nice bits and
bobs on Instagram lately and I picked up
some really nice pieces including some
beauty bits and bobs which I feel like
could be some pretty good dupes
especially some like priming water and
some brushes so if you want a Primark to
do testing yo let me know in the
comments down below I'm about to go to
another meeting with a PR company and
then I've got an afternoon tea at Soho
Hotel so I think I'll catch up with you
at the afternoon tea
okay logging in a restaurant I'm here
with my laptop and my cup of coffee
waiting since for two hours oh hello cat
there's a queue a caller attend a caller
from destroy and I learned so much as
absent fascinating and we got a feel
turn you products well so try those out
of it later you know I get along with
them
and then I went to soldiers so on the
ground floor here and there's new
skincare and a beautiful gene you as in
my GE n in you and what they do is
really really cool and interesting
basically a has takes warm on the inside
right now so getting a little bit of DNA
inside of my house
they were explaining that when it comes
to skin we get our skin 40% from the
products that we use and 60% in that
lifestyle and 60% is in our DNA is that
when finding the right skincare it's
very important to look our DNA hence why
they take the swaps and what they're
going to do is look at my skin DNA and
then they're going to be able to
prescribe a serum which will be perfect
for me and it will help my skin when it
comes to building collagen and being
well protected there's a really cool
idea so I'll bring you guys along then I
come to my consultation with scientist
dr. in a few weeks and she got my
results back so yeah just insulted our
crossover
my tea and soybean petroleum vending
Pacey and we're going to have nice
dinner so I catch up with you I'll show
you a few clips of dinner as well when
the guys are here
I still have any makeup on so I feel a
little bit sorry
and yeah ketchup
back home again after a really lovely
meal at Forest on the roof when it's Ben
and Katie and the dogs are just outside
going because some wee wees they have
been home alone a little bit longer than
I would have liked have left them but
they've got each other they're happy I
thought I just really quickly show you
some of the bits and bobs from today so
I mentioned that I went to the afternoon
tea with Paula's Choice and how it
actually looks in the goodie bag so
let's have a little look what's in here
tissue paper right so the first thing is
ultra light sheer antioxidant
concentrate serum so this is a serum
that fights the multiple signs of aging
then what have we got very generous
goodie bag lovely silver packaging a
smoothing primer SPF 30
I think that's honor they were talking
about towards the end I had to suddenly
leave a little bit early primes protects
and perfects it sounds really good and
then this is the main product that they
were talking about it's a new Omega
serum I think this is it yeah Omega plus
complex and this is all about helping
the skin to maintain its strong and
barriers to resist ageing and pollution
all that jazz then we've got another
treatment skin transforming multi
correction treatment because it's Bobson
here this is the classic one everyone
knows about from Paula's Choice skin
perfecting salicylic acid every beauty
blogger in the world just loves that one
and finally youth extending daily
hydrating fluid so totally squirrels by
Paula's Choice
I look forward having a look through
those then we've got my goodies from Liz
Earle so while I was waiting to see
Avigail out having a little flick
through the book that was on the coffee
table and it certainly made me want to
get it so their marketing did well there
so I pick it up this one which is Liz
Elle's skin and it's recipes in the
ultimate well being planned for radiant
skin in six weeks and as loads of cool
stuff in here this loads like skin care
ships and then also recipes use
ingredients that are really good for
your skin so yes I'm looking forward to
having a look through that and then I
also mentioned to Abigail that I like to
do a lot of my skincare at the gym so
she very kindly granted me this bag
which has got miniatures of all my
favorite little bits and this one which
is the super skin overnight mask I'm
going to try this tonight because I feel
like my skin is going to love that and
then finally we have what's this one ah
so nice concentrate for night this is an
oil I think organic rosehip oil argan
oil and neroli oil sounds so nice my
skin up see loves oils so I'm sure will
absolutely adore that um Club Monaco is
next so I did go back and get that
jumper which I showed you guys show you
okay it's so much easier for a proper
camera up there
so here is my gorgeous new jumper it's
actually better when you guys saw it on
the mannequin but yeah it covers the
shoulders and then it has this little
loop here where you'll see a little bit
of like shoulder flesh long-sleeve
gorgeous pink jumper so really excited
to wear that it's very me I feel and
then finally I got one of these like
everlasting bags from Primark buddy one
of these bits in here is for you I got
some cotton pads I got some exfoliating
gloves I got some Beauty Blender tips so
this is for you to do a video and
comparing this he's we're going his
bomber I don't know he knows the cameras
facing this way this is for you to do a
video one naked by tho comparing this to
the GoPro this is the Primark version of
a GoPro oh shoot and it was 28 pounds
right so uh in case you guys I bought it
in case you guys didn't know Charlie
launched his YouTube channel a couple of
days ago so I'll leave a link to it down
below and he's going to be using the
GoPro for vlogging but I saw this in
Primark and it's basically the Primark
GoPro in its twin
see eight pounds so Charlie's gonna be
testing this on his YouTube channel oh
wow so if you want to see how it is and
make sure you subscribe to him I'm
Keynes decent tech I also got some
makeup palettes and these were all
bought with it in mind that I'm going to
compare them to the high-end versions so
this is obviously like the Anastasia
glow kit and this is obviously max gear
chief of the Anastasia contour kit so
let me know if you'd like a video on
Primark dupes because that's something I
might do and then obviously we've got
Beauty Blender dupes this is pretty much
a deep for the Smashbox priming water I
even the packaging is the same and then
I've got a lip roll errs because they're
rose gold and I always use them um I got
a dupe for bio oil this was two pound 90
and it was stored in the shop above the
bio oil which was seven pound 40s
they're obviously trying to show you
this exactly the same then I got a dupe
for the artiste brushes so this kind of
style makeup brush um I also got these
pajamas because I thought they looked
like the black Olivia van haul ones
so really Trafford those obviously the
Olivia van whole ones are the ones that
are over 300 quid and but these were
less than a fiver so they look
absolutely identical now I have the
white ones the pink ones and the dupes
um I got a brow gel because it's so
cheap in there I thought it'd be great
if we can find a dupe for gimme brow I
got this lipstick because it was 90 P
and this is a detangling shower brush I
thought I'd use that in the gym this is
a little mirror rose gold mirror that
was a pound so that's really handy is
having my handbag um a pound as well
mattifying a makeup powder sheets you
know the blotting papers because they're
so handy and finally I picked up some
more hangers you guys are always asking
where my coat hangers are from they are
from Primark and I picked up some new
ones cuz these ones have a little heart
in the middle so I thought they were
cute and a Lulu Bella
who's doing what next drink ferocious
