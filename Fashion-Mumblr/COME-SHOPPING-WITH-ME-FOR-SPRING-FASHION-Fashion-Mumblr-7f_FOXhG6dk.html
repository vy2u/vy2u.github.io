weekly vlog it is some day today I think
when I started doing these weekly out
for diaries I used to start on Sundays
and then something changed and I started
starting them on Mondays I don't know
but Sunday's today I'm about to head to
Kings Road to go shopping with Mama we
have just made a delicious healthy pizza
for lunch it was like a kale and
hazelnut base with no beetroot and
hazelnut base with kale and mozzarella
and homemade dough in the Thermomix so
that was delicious
I'm absolutely full to the brim
considering how small the pizzas were
I'm gonna put a photo of them on the
screen now and I did do some Instagram
stories and how I made them you caught
that it is about three o'clock now and
we are as I said heading out to do a
little bit of shopping and I thought oh
very quickly show you my outfit of the
day okie dokie so I'm bundled up in all
the layers because despite the fact that
it's really nice and sunny it's
absolutely freezing outside so I've got
on my Rhys Travis you will probably
recognize these from me wearing them all
the time and I featured them in my
February favorites and my okay Bennett
boots which I also featured in the
favorites and then underneath you can't
really see but it's my top with a
beautiful scalloped detail from Club
Monaco my pink scarf Reiss coat and then
new surprises I'm gonna be taking my
mulberry bag this is my outfit of the
day time to hit the shops well we've got
some daylight and while this is looking
beautiful I thought I'd just show you
our III from the door this was sent to
us by lint
it was also filled with a little little
lint chocolate eggs so it looks
absolutely gorgeous how about that for a
welcome to our house so cute right time
to hit up the kingsroad
good morning it is Monday I'm showing
you what I can see instead of my face
because firstly I don't have enough
hands and also it is snowing so heavily
in London this morning looks absolutely
beautiful it's very very cold got my
gloves on I'm heading to a meeting and
then I'm heading into the Lanesboro
because Victoria from in the fro she
launched a range of handbags last night
with stress free they already sold out
that is how beautiful they are so
heading there next but look can you see
all the snow so so beautiful I'm bit
late for my first meeting so I'll see
you later with this gorgeous lady
beautiful breakfast at Lanesboro what we
got coming up
avocado on toast bloggers fave got to be
done Freddie oh darling thank you very
much you're like I just got you on
Freddie Freddie's into the kitchen made
me a coffee
home again I just popped back to let the
dogs out and I'm about to go off back
into central London in a second for
another meeting I've actually got lunch
with the co-founder of the Borean which
is going to be very very exciting to a
restaurant called BOGO Ricard which I've
heard a lot of really good things about
but have not visited yet so as you saw I
was just at the Lanesboro for Victoria's
launch of her new a collection with
Strath berries such a beautiful
collection you saw a few of the bags on
the table they are I cannot even
describe the craftsmanship on these bags
so beautifully made and we were so
kindly given one Victoria chose the bags
that she thought each of us would love
and she chose so perfectly everyone was
so so happy with their design such a
gorgeous collaboration the colors are
stunning and it just makes me so so
happy when I see bloggers doing these
incredible collaborations it fills me
with so much inspiration so proud of the
vlogging community it really is so so
incredible if I very quickly show you my
outfit of the day before I head out
again now that I have a full-length
mirror in front of me I was carrying my
mulberry bag earlier but now I have my
beautiful I believe this is called the
east/west bag the mini and I will leave
it linked down below although I think it
is sold out at the moment they sold out
so so quickly unsurprisingly but I think
they may be coming back on pre-order so
I'll leave all the information about the
beautiful bag down below has gorgeous
silver hardware and a little magnet so
this little strap is always super secure
a couple of sections inside and then a
little envelope pocket here as well so
beautiful it goes in my wardrobe so so
perfectly look at how amazingly it mixes
with all of these colors and then for
the rest of my outfit I am wearing my
club Monaco actually I'm pretty much
Oakland Monaco the jumper and the skirts
are both old season Club Monaco not very
practical considering that it was
snowing this morning but my coat is
super super warm Monica Vernon dirt
jewelry as always and then I have got my
Stuart Weitzman boots on these are my
brown boots they do keep slipping down a
little bit which is rather annoying but
yeah that's the outfit of the day I'm
now gonna head back into town for my
lunch so I will see you a little
so after a lovely lunch at the river
which I'll go through later and just
cover to the estee lauder counter here
at Selfridges to rediscover double words
I used two words our work was hard but
then a little bit heavy sometimes but
now they have got fifty shades and the
Rangers incredible and I wanted to try
to see if I could make it look a little
bit low to my scale is something nice to
spray so come here for a little makeover
I put it on and now just to surprise it
with a buffing brush so it's a really
lovely light weight base very glowing so
I use the illuminating primer
Mace's looking amazing but these are all
colors my shade is one of the major
shades surprise surprise let me show you
how many they've got huge solution so
this is the double wear that we all know
and love
SPF 10 stay in place super super
long-lasting and then they've got from
the lovely pale ivory shades
to the deeper warmer shades I think this
is my one here
I am back home again that my makeup is
looking super glowy and fresh I had I'm
not sure if you could hear what I was
saying in Selfridges but I went and got
shade tested they've got this very
snazzy I match technology this little
device which takes three pictures of
different areas of your face and gets
your exact perfect shade and the Estee
Lauder Double Wear foundation so I had
that done I kind of knew that the one
that I had at home was a little bit too
dark for me so now I know my exact
perfect shade which is amazing and I
always thought of Delaware as being like
a winter foundation like really high
coverage don't really get the glow but I
have got the blow I'm loving how this
base looks so I feel like I might be
switching it up back to the double wear
what do you guys think I'll keep you
updated some home now back with my
little cherub boys who are outside
charging around the lawn like absolute
hooligans I've just put my video live my
weekly vlog from last week has just gone
live it's a really long way it's the one
where I try on and Viktor and Rolf gowns
go to the fund fair and Freddie is doing
weird impressions of me talking to the
dogs there's just loads of good bloggers
pals in that one so yeah check out last
week's weekly outfit Diaries if you want
to see what I did last week I'm gonna go
and have one of my energy balls I don't
if you saw me making them on my
Instagram stories it's going to the
kitchen but I like to make these kind of
cacao seed mix energy balls and they are
like my office and the hallway lights on
and they are like my go-to afternoon
snack you know and it's like three or
four o'clock and you don't really want
to be making yourself a proper meal but
you're hungry and you don't want to
reach for the crisps I then have these
energy rules in the fridge and they're
so good for snacking it's a healthy they
give you lots of energy they fill you up
but in a healthy way
this really doesn't look like much at
all but it is honestly because of the
cacao in there you become satisfied
really quickly like it's really I mean
it's quite big you think I don't know
like a golf ball size and it's got all
the seeds and nuts in there goji berries
it's made with dates
yeah leave my recipe link down below and
honestly it's surprising how filling
these bad boys are you can't have any
young men it's got cacao in there you
won't like it I promise you you won't
like it my young friend I love you I do
I love you so much you silly boy
dedicated to you made the secret
bringing love
few hours later now and as you just saw
I have just spent my Monday evening
cleaning my makeup brushes it's usually
a Sunday afternoon task but what
happened last night I think maybe I was
just in a zombie mode and didn't get
them done so just clean my makeup
brushes and I have been real istening to
the secret so you guys have heard me
talking about the secret loads and loads
and loads I have the hardback copy of
the book well I did I've lent it to
someone I feel like everyone that earns
the secret and like really believes in
it and act upon it then feels the need
to lend it to everyone because no one
can believe how amazing it is and then
you'll just like read this so don't have
the book anymore but I have downloaded
it on audible I have really gotten into
listening to books lately and I'm using
audible which is an Amazon service so I
can listen to them on my Alexa as well
which is amazing I am listening to books
in the car while I'm cooking when I'm
doing my makeup while I'm in the bath
while I'm cleaning my makeup brushes
just on the tube as well because you can
obviously download them I am really
getting into it I've always been the
kind of person that loves absorbing
information but I also the kind of
person that can't sit still
so the fact that I can listen and absorb
and also do things at the same time is
amazing so I have been real istening to
the secret I'm only on the first chapter
so far but already it's just re-ignited
my love for it if you guys don't know
what the secret is
it's quite hard to explain but once you
try it you'll become totally a believer
in it it's basically the law of
attraction so it's the power of the mind
bear with me and how if you put your
mind to something and you truly believe
that it will happen it will and I've
used it so many times from the tiniest
little things like when I first
discovered the secret it was when we
were in Croatia I used the secret to see
dolphins on a boat trip it happened the
same day that I read that chapter in the
secret so I instantly believed in it I
use it on a daily basis things like oh
I'm not gonna text that person then I'm
going to be late because this is going
to be a really quick journey and then
surely
or the traffic lights will be green all
the tubes will be there on time and I
will get there on time so it's just
making my life run more smoothly even
serious things like for example when
deke went in for his operation Charlie
can be quite negative sometimes he's
like oh I hope he's gonna be okay
whereas I knew he was going to be okay I
used all of my positivity all of my
positive thinking to ensure that he was
going to be okay so I bought him a new
treat so that when he came out of the
vets I knew he'd be fine and be healthy
and ready for his new treats and of
course he was and then if you listen to
the book says chapters on relationships
there's chapters on money it's kind of
like the whole idea of dress for the job
you want not for the job that you've got
if you dress the part if you act as
though you've already got something then
surely enough the universe will make it
happen and it will come to you I've also
used it as you may know to get a hundred
thousand subscribers I already bought
myself the congratulatory bracelet that
had a hundred thousand engraved on it I
bought myself that when I had only forty
thousand subscribers and I always said
to myself this is going to be a
Valentine's Day gift to myself when I
hit to a hundred thousand subscribers I
hit a hundred thousand on February the
13th so I got to give myself that
bracelet on Valentine's Day and that is
just yeah I wear that bracelet I've just
taken off to do the washing-up of my
makeup brushes but wear that bracelet
every day so yeah true true believer if
you guys want to know more I would
highly recommend listening to the book I
think it can be quite a quite a tough
read because it's a little bit I don't
know I want to say patronizing it kind
of is but listening to it I do really
enjoy audible have given me a 30-day
free trial and also a free book for you
guys to download so you can go to

going to go downstairs now make myself a
mac and cheese get my secret playing
again it also has a sleep timer so if
you like to listen to things while you
go to bed at the moment while Charlie's
not here I've been listening to it
before bed and you can actually put it
on a sleep timer so I put it on at
thirty minutes and then it says and then
it switches off so you don't wake up at
three o'clock in the morning with the
secret rambling on you can listen to it
at a faster speed if you are impatient
skip chapters save Clips even got a
special car mode very very clever
see ya let's go downstairs listen to
some more secret musings and get cooking
history you're right there Dexy just
chilling in the dishwasher just have it
up you know mac and cheese
let's go get okay
so I forgot to show you forgot to show
you the final result of my mac and
cheese but it was very very tasty and
let you know that thought I would very
quickly run through my evening skincare
routine with you starting off with a
deathly or aroma cleanse my slow water
soothing mostly water with rose
essential oil I love rose essential oil
and I've had a very calming of my skin
and I love a good of my slow water so
this is a current phase and it's quarter
to nine at the moment and I'm actually
I'm gonna go straight to bed I don't
know what it is but I mean I'm gonna lie
and watch suits and I'm going to
probably do a little bit of actually no
I'm not even going to do emails I'm
gonna get up early in the morning and do
a productive things I get so nostalgic
after eating mac and cheese I can't even
be bothered to have a bath that's how
lazy I'm feeling right now yeah mac and
cheese will do that to you it's really
it really is my guilty pleasure so yes
so morning and evening skincare routine
I tend to start with my slow water and
to remove the majority of the oils on my
skin and the majority of the makeup as
well including a quick so I pervert the
eyes but I'm not going to happy on the
old makeup removal and then surprise
surprise I go in with my list I'll
cleanse and polish this you guys are
probably bored of hearing me talking
about but I just love it so much if you
are like yet to find a cleanser that
really works your skin and you've not
tried this yet but I highly recommend it
so many of my friends I've recommended
it to I just like oh my gosh I don't
know what I did before it it's just
brilliant I find it very calming I find
that it just makes my skin always good
so love this so after I've massaged that
in I'm running a muslin cloth under the
hot top not too hot it's just like you
and the act of buffing it with this
cloth which is a little bit texture to
just very very gently exfoliates the
skin so you're always revealing your
fresh skin underneath next I'm going to
tone
I'm not going to flash you and I'm going
to be using surprise surprise little
instant boots skin tonic boots boost
skin tonic revive sizes soothes and
turns for radiant looking skin I find
that this really helps to balance the
skin after cleansing well we've got a
bumpy joining us when Charlie's not here
I let dexian Vicky Ethan bed with me oh
my boys my boys my boys it's at this
time when I'm taking off my makeup and
having my evening pamper a little bit of
me time this is another time that I
usually listen to my audio book whether
that's the secret or something else and
I'm catching up on if you guys have
downloaded it or if you're also already
inaudible fan let me know if you've got
any recommendations down below let me
know what you enjoy listening to and you
check flex if I also love Justin Yukon
airplanes and when I'm on the beach that
kind of thing so let me know if you've
got any recommendations
okay skin is toned next I'm going to use
the higher low serum b5 from a rush so
this is particularly good at this time
at this time of year all year round you
should use this really the hyaluronic
acid helps to plump up the skin helps
the skin restore its elasticity
helps the skin to repair itself keep
your skin looking lovely and juicy and
plump
I get very dehydrated skin all year
round so hyaluronic acid is something
that I need in my skincare routine and
this product is just really really
lovely I feel like the rash is just a
brand that you can trust when it comes
to ingredients a good feel skin I love
that Pat that into my skin I feel like
instantly it's like my skin is going ah
that's how it feels it does remain tacky
on the skin for I'd say four or five
minutes so it's at this point they'll
usually you brush my teeth and go
pajamas ok so the PJs are on my serum
has sunk in and onto the final stages I
have been using the la Mer I concentrate
I have to be very careful not to put too
much of this on because it's so rich
that I find if it goes too close to my
eyes then it makes my eyes a little bit
puffy so I use the spatula it's actually
like a cooling silver ball and I take
the tiniest little bit go 1 2 3 1 2 3
and then massage it but not too close to
my eyes because if I get too much too
close to my eyes and it can make my eyes
a bit puffy I know so many people and
even like so many of my mom's friends
that just swear by this eye cream so
much and I'd say that my eye area is the
one area where I am starting to slowly
but surely see some very delicate signs
of aging and I want to combat that I
don't want them to get any worse so this
is the one area my skincare routine but
I'm really heavily investing so go and
stretch the best with la Mer then what
I'm going to do is apply the Elemis
superfood facial oil this one here you
guys know already how much I adore
alamos skincare I've been using the
spacial oil since last summer I think on
and off and it's got lots of super food
ingredients and there helps to really
intensely hydrate the skin which is
always good my skin type is dehydrated
so anything that hydrates is brilliant
and it's also just very soothing it
helps the skin to really focus on its
own protective barrier so there's
antioxidants in there which help the
skin fight against any pollutants and as
they live in central London that's very
important it's not like nagger anti
aging or nagger anti blemish or anything
it really is just focusing it's got
prebiotics in there as well so it really
just helps the skin to focus on what it
needs to do to protect itself so I feel
like for all skin types it's amazing so
I will usually massage the soon for like
30 seconds
so and then I'll get into bed I'll start
watching whatever I'm going to watch and
then in about half an hour I've applied
this it's the superfood night cream
again from LMS from the superfood range
the oil it was such a success they
decided to expand the range and this is
one of the new products so it says Omega
rich night cream feeds dry and depleted
skin super boosting with intense
nutrition a prebiotic concentrated
superfoods of barley quinoa and sweet
almond milk now it's your skin while you
sleep so this is what I'll be applying
in 20 minutes or so I'm gonna get into
bed now and that's all for me today I'll
see you guys in the morning
good night good morning I look like a
pale moon like a ghost this morning
because I just exfoliated every bit of
tan off my face I had a real pampering
bath this morning I'm not gonna do a
full get ready with me because I did
that at the end of last weekly vlog and
that's like my everyday makeup routine /
filming face but I did want to quickly
do a first impressions of the abortion
Matt's creme mattifying face cream blur
effect so a Borean are pretty much the
masters of these kind of finishing
products so the very last thing you
apply before going in with your
foundation and whereas last year is all
about the glow this year the skincare
prediction is that it's going to be a
little bit more matte so this is their
Mac creme and I still really like a
radiant complexion but this promises a
Maps yet still radiant complexion so I'm
really really intrigued it's got a
really nice soft feel to it so when you
put a tiny bit on my skin is already
cleanse turns moisturized etcetera
etcetera apparently this has got Korean
white water lily in there as the main
ingredient I feel like with Korean
inspired skincare products you just know
they're going to work like there's no
faffing about with weird names that no
one really understands they just choose
ingredients and products that work so I
would say that this has left my skin
almost like velvety it feels really nice
it feels a tiny bit tacky but I like
that because it feels like my makeup is
gonna stick to it and it's had a slight
blurring effect as well my poor
look blurred out which is great my skin
certainly looks mats but it definitely
doesn't look dull which is really really
good this is all just obviously major
major first impressions I'm going to put
my makeup on now and and I will whiz
through that not gonna talk through it
all although I am gonna be trying
different products this morning but as I
said I'm not going to go through them
all I just want to do some you know
trying out new things so I'm gonna whiz
through and I'll catch up with you when
I've got a full face of makeup on and
let you know how I think my face looks
I don't know what is up with this
lighting today but I just feel so pale
oh my goodness maybe it is that I've
literally scoped off all my tan and butt
so I've just done my makeup as I said I
tried mostly new things today I tried
out a new wire cell all-in-one glow
foundation that's this one here that's
what I've got on very mortuary it's
quite strange like it feels like you're
not really putting anything on your skin
very much like a tinted moisturizer but
then the coverage was fairly high and
then a couple of things that I've had in
my collection for ages but don't use
enough my Clinique airbrush concealer
and actually I really really loved how
this bright in the under eye area but
it's quite fresh like it's almost like a
pinky color this is oh one fair so I've
got like a makeup brush bristle on my
nose it's really really itchy and so
yeah really likes how that illuminated
under the eye area I just like doing
morning's like this too and I use things
that I don't use in my everyday makeup
routine it's a really nice way of just
making sure I'm using everything in my
collection and then brush wise I used
the it cosmetics this is the heavenly
luxe complexion perfection brush so I
applied the foundation with the large
buffing end and then I buffed in my
concealer with a smaller end so it's
really handy in that it's got these two
ends really enjoyed using that and need
to blow-dry my hair my lips are super
dry so I put on a couple of different
lip balms firstly the Accord early
French kiss now I wouldn't say that this
is like a good one for mega mega dry
lips but is if your lips are in fairly
good condition a beautiful color really
lovely and soft this is called the
seduction tinted lip balm so really
liked that one but I do find my girl and
one's a little bit more hydrating so I
put that on afterwards what else did I
use I used a really lovely to face book
palette this is the white peach palette
some really nice shades in there I used
as always three neutral ones he's two
down here and I use an it cosmetics and
starrer
my usual by Terry blush and then Tom
Ford highlight I use the hourglass fiber
brow gel
and finish off with my fictional flower
bomb next fragrance which I love just
spread far too much so yeah quite
pleased with how this has turned out
it's a very fresh spring makeup look my
skin does look glowy but it just feels
like it's gonna stick around for a long
time it doesn't like sometimes when you
just finish your makeup you feel the
need to apply extra powder because you
think it's gonna disappear I don't feel
like that so hopefully hopefully it'll
stick around
are we vlogging throughout the day I'm
just working from home today I'm gonna
fill my wardrobe tour so I'm gonna do
something with my hair but first of all
Georgia is on her way and she's bringing
her new puppy dog called Pepe who's of
Brussels Griffon I hope that's correct I
will check with her and so I'm very
excited to meet him and she's just
texting me saying that they're five
minutes away so I'm going to put Dexter
in Dickens in the garden so they can
meet on neutral territory but I will
film - puppies meeting each other so
yeah it seems
oh my god we made oh wait
let's bring Pepe out here
how Georgia and Pepe have gone home and
as you saw from that clip my two boys
are bullies
Dexter and Dicky I have to say I'm
ashamed of their behavior this morning
they were very ferocious they were not
very welcoming and yeah if anyone has
also got sausage dogs then please let me
know what I can do because yes we have a
bit of a problem that they were being
very very unfriendly so hopefully when
Georgia comes back tomorrow they will be
much better behaved because you've been
very naughty naughty boys I'm gonna make
myself some lunch now I have just
defrosted the dough that I froze after
making my healthy pizzas at the weekend
as my dough is defrosted and I made them
far too thick last times I'm gonna
really roll it out still got some of the
beetroot puree I also just started
editing this vlog and it's already half
an hour long and it's only Tuesday so
yeah I'm just gonna whisk through this
and then catch up with you guys this
afternoon I'm cold with my service
automated that's it I've run into my
Jew distracted sub Conestoga load and
careful don't pull the cord

fairly healthy whole wheat base and I
made a couple of days ago the tomato
sauce is actually beetroot and hazelnut
puree then we've got kale okay in Gales
corrode and go and get I just am I at my
browser renders there might be living in

April and I'm yet to check it out in
those by 10 minutes and I can
it's new design concept and the storks

I'm getting
50 minutes to find a body treatment -
expecially in an hour-long massage 50
minute massage using their divine body
oil which I love and I just adore
massages and then you can also get
add-ons so I thought embody polisher
adult as well so a nice ills grab which
I can create a fourth massage snipped

will show you how to pour tea boutique
so this is the treatment room light my
camera's going a bit funny it's excited
my massage even a shower in here because
I'm having a body scrub
so I'll scrub all the beads off
afterwards smells so good in here I'm
home from my pampering treat at the
Quarterly's spa excuse my hair and face
obviously a little bit oily at the
moment it was absolutely heavenly the
scrub that she used to begin with was
just you know when you scrub yourself
it's not quite the same as when
someone's like massaging a scrub into
you I feel like a baby right now so soft
and then I definitely dosed off during
the massage it was the divine oil that
warmed up and it smelt amazing my skin
is literally so soft and I feel totally
chilled out I don't know why Dicky is
licking me I've just come home and
whipped up a little meal for one this is
naki with a creamy nutmeggy parmesan ii
pancetta resource I literally just threw
a load of ingredients in a bowl and I
think that looks pretty good
literally my dream meal oh hello young
man not for you so I'm gonna dig into
this I'm gonna watch some suits tonight
is my last night alone Charlie's coming
back tomorrow so that doesn't mean my
last night with my cherubs in bed with
me so I'm gonna make the most of it lots
of snuggles tonight
I remember those days we were good
morning it is Wednesday and we've woken
up to a total whiteout here in London I
know that many of you probably live in
cold countries and this is absolutely
normal but us I don't think we've seen
snow like this for at least three or
four years in London so it's very
exciting I've got my snow boots on
heading off to the gym
I think Clapham Common is going to look
absolutely beautiful so I'll show you
that clear blue skies as well
beautiful sunrise this morning
everything's got like pink halo glow to
it and I'm all bundled up you're able to
enjoy it
just to see
never true
Navan
we desert you learn to a parent
self-aware about some puppeteer and
drinking liquor out the bottle at a
party we know no one there didn't even
care if we stay there's rebar aside each
other or is out each other from inside
each other we focus on each other
remember when you kiss I felt a stuff
Parkins to see
it is another snow day in London today
I'm braving the cold heading out for a
day of meetings but first of all heading
it to Daniel Galvin I have
okay hair is done I thought I would very
quickly show you the color before I head
to my next meeting my roots are gone
hallelujah Daisy just made it look super
super natural I feel like myself again
and this blow-dry I asked for a basic
flow Drive it's perfect
very very happy back to Jordan firehouse
now for meeting number two of the day
also that was really quick normally I'm
in a hairdresser about 7 hours getting
my hair colored but I've only been here
two and a half
the truth
never children
okay so I've just got home and naturally
it got straight into my pajamas and
dressing gown after a long day in town
and I've just come straight home from
the clinic Moisture Surge event it was a
lovely afternoon tea on Greek Street
they painted the whole place pink in
honor of their Moisture Surge
which you probably already know is this
bad boy this is a real orange so they've
just redeveloped it with it now has
72-hour replenishing hydrator this has
been a favorite of mine for so long if
you've seen any of my vlogs or like
in-flight beauty routines you'll see
that I always have a little pot like a
travel-size pot of Moisture Surge on
long-haul flights as soon as I go on the
airplane I always take my makeup off
shove this on and it just helps your
skin and battle the moisture loss on
airplanes so when you land your skin
looks as glowing and plump as it did in
fact sometimes even better than when you
took office so I'm gonna take my makeup
off now I feel like my skin is always
dehydrated
so very much looking forward to giving
it some hydration with the new Moisture
Surge
okay so we are pale and makeup free and
now I'm going to apply the new Moisture
Surge so this is now a slightly
different consistency it's a gel cream
so very refreshing to apply it's got
higher onok acid in there which as you
may know is pretty much the best
ingredient for hydrating the skin it
holds I think it's a thousand times its
weight in moisture I don't even know how
that works but it does
so amazing for keeping the skin hydrated
can you say that this will keep your
skin hydrated 72 hours even if you wash
your face which is amazing again don't
know how that works but I believe them
it's also got activated aloe in there
and caffeine which helps the skin to
hold on to its own moisture so basically
the skin has continually rehydrating
itself so if you go outside at the cold
and then you come in into a really warm
room the skin just stays at like a
neutral well hydrated level which is
very important at this time of year when
you're flying etc etc I remember the old
Moisture Surge it kind of felt like
you're putting a face mask on and it
would sit on the skin for a little while
whereas because this is a gel formula it
feels like it's sunk in straight to
weight so you could use this every day
before your makeup it's really very fast
absorbing my skin just feels refreshed
now as opposed to a little bit sticky
after day in the city exactly what my
skin needs and so yeah I'm gonna just go
and do some work let my skin enjoy the
moisture and I will catch up with you
guys in the morning
bye
so it is currently Saturday I didn't
actually vlog at all yesterday because I
was just having day at home but today
I've come to this amazing building it's
worn at Belgravia and stylists and
rituals are having a bit of a slowdown
event as they've got someone doing head
massages I just had a very relaxing head
massage using mental serums to just
clear the mind I've got an eidetic
ginger and rose tea really nice way to
start the day I'm just spending the next
half an hour here relaxing I think about
a meditation session next and then I'm
gonna do this little thing and meeting
the IKEA branch perfectly
hello again my darlings so I think the
last time I spoke to you was at the
rituals event and since then I delivered
shopping on Oxford streets went into a
few stores and then went to Sloane
Square met my friends Vicki and Sarah we
had a nice lunch together and I did a
little bit of shopping there as well so
I thought I would show you what I bought
also went into the mic oven at a store
on Duke of York Square which is a
beautiful store and I didn't realize
because vicki was choosing some new
jewelry I didn't realize that they have
this service where you can get your
jewelry clean for free so I took in my
bracelet this one where is it this one
here and I had the diamonds cleaned
actually the whole bracelet cleaned but
now it looks super sparkly again and
also my necklace that I wear every
single day with the little heart so as
you can see they're super sparkly again
just like new that was an amazing
service I don't know what's going on the
lighting I think this camera is really
about to die so I can see lines on the
screen hopefully that's not gonna happen
when I'm editing but if you're seeing
this with lines across the screen I'm
very sorry I'm gonna turn the light up
okay so I did buy quite a lot I'm gonna
whiz through everything really quickly
first of all I bought mainly for Charlie
and you ESOP hand wash this is the
reverence aromatic hand wash and it's
got little beads of pumice in there so
it also exfoliates your hands as well
really gently smells absolutely amazing
so I went to the ESOP on the juke of
York Square to pick that one up I have a
lot of things from House of Fraser and
then also in this bag I have other stuff
I don't wanna cry around those who carry
bags I've had a lot of you guys actually
tagging me in pictures of phase 8 things
saying oh my god Josie this collection
is so you so I picked up some phase 8
things from House of Fraser the first of
which is this gorgeous long jacket now I
thought this would be a really perfect
jacket for spring
it's a beautiful light pink color it is
lined really beautiful quality and
three-quarter sleeves really lovely long
length I think for occasion where that's
gonna be
gorgeous so very much looking forward to
trying this on not going to do trial
clips because it's not a real haul but
it's no doubt you'll be seeing this in
upcoming photos etc also from phase
eight is this jumper I just thought the
color was really really mean really
lovely relaxed fit it's got kind of
batwing sleeves and it's like a pinky
Marv I don't know if you can see the
texture but it looks a little bit like
an uneven kind of pink and I think it's
really nice very cool about top so I
thought that would look really nice for
making jeans look a little bit smarter
or with white high waisted rousers I
thought that'd be a lovely effect I
always tend to buy my clothes in outfits
and that's exactly what I've done here
so I also picked up this pair of
trousers high-waisted very kind of wide
leg Palazzo style trousers these are a
brand called ISA from House of Fraser so
I thought they would pair really
beautifully with that jumper and that
coat and then lastly from Casa Fraser
they have a lot of brands in there so I
picked up these dune boots they are dune
Black Label which is their their smart
label and I've been looking some boots
like this for quite a long time I think
they're really nice for wearing jeans
wearing with loads different outfit
combinations and I wanted some in my
wardrobe to spring it so I got those as
well
pointed toe I always find it super
flattering that's everything I got from
House of Fraser I then went into Topshop
I picked up this bag I've seen this a
lot on my Instagram I think it's very me
it was only 28 pounds and obviously kind
of Chloe vibes so love that love that
you can take the long strap off just
have a little hand held so that's very
very cute and also from Topshop I picked
up these trousers these are the kind of
things that I know I will wear so much
in the house they are gain wide legs
elasticated waistband so super
comfortable and they're like a velvet
material so they'll be very very
comfortable for those days and I'm
working from home for any long-haul
flights things like that and then I also
nipped in - hmm and I spotted this as
soon as I walked in I've been looking
for a pink corduroy skirt for a long
time I do have one from a Topshop but
it's got some really big buttons on it
and I wanted something a bit more plain
when I saw this I knew instantly it's
exactly what I've been looking for under
20 pounds as well
so really lovely one for my spring
wardrobe okay next is River Island also
kind of lounge wear trousers slash
traveling trousers I picked up these
they don't really look anything on
camera but I think when I wear them
they'll be lovely also these could
definitely be dressed up with the white
dune boots they've got a slit down at
the bottom they'll probably finish just
above the ankle so that could be a
really nice way of styling these with
boots as well then I also from River
Island got these trousers they are
really lovely smart style trouser with
this ruffle detail down the side with
pearls in there as well but they were
really really lovely a nice kind of
smart work wear piece perhaps but also I
think it should be dressed down with a
t-shirt dressed up with heels very much
looking forward to trying those again
that nice and high-waisted and then
finally from River Island in the exact
same material I got this skirt I thought
it was very Chanel asked looks really
high-end it's got the lovely detail on
the buttons and then it's got a button
detail on the pockets rather and then
this tassel detail at the bottom which
actually I'm not sure I love I think
this is kind of boho II whereas this is
very prim and proper and not sure the
two go together might take off the
tassels let me know what you think but
this skirt as I'm sure you guys know if
you knew my style will get a lot of wear
for sure and finally last but not least
Club Monaco I absolutely had to go in
there and and while I was shopping the
shop assistant who was absolutely lovely
actually let me know that they were
doing at 30% off for friends and family
and she said she was happy to give me
that discount as well which is very kind
of her so I'll show you what all right
hipster up first of all this felt it was
actually reduced 45 pounds and Club
Monaco bring out the belt very similar
to this very often they've gotten loads
different colors and you can really make
it the size that you want
so I actually tried this with my coat I
put it on over my coat and it's a really
nice way of cinching in the waist and if
you don't have any pink in your
outerwear it just makes it a little bit
more girly so love that and then
beautifully wrapped up it always come so
gorgeously wrapped inside here we have
some gorgeous spring pieces firstly the
stress so this is kind of shirt style it
reminded me of almost like Safari style
I saw this on the mannequin and it's
what drew me into the shop it's got this
beautiful tie at the waist very shirt
like detail at the top here even to the
extent of having shirt style cuffs on
the sleeves and then it is a skirt at
the bottom it's got an elasticated
detail at the back which means that the
back is quite open and then the back
almost looks a little bit like a trench
coat with the fact that it's got a half
cape but let's be honest it is
absolutely the color that drew me to
that one then and I feel like Club
Monaco bring something like this back
season after season just a really
classic dress I wear things like this a
lot during spring and summer on warmer
days on holidays and it's got scalloped
detail at the bottom a scalloped detail
that light is washing it out a little
bit scalloped detail around the waist
and then the neckline is just so so
girly and feminine absolutely love it
and with the waist belt it just fits so
beautifully and finally this gorgeous
top this is just so so stunning it's a
v-neck and then it has a big bow on one
shoulder and the bow kind of flops over
to create like a shoulder cap and then
this thinner strap and the other side
this I think will be so gorgeous on
beach holidays in summer if I've got any
lovely events to go to the material is
quite thick it's like a really intricate
detail it's got like a woven effect on
it but absolutely absolutely beautiful
so very much looking forward to wearing
that when the temperatures do start to
rise it's really funny I'm buying stuff
like this in the beginning of the vlog
it was snow and so I think that's where
I'm going to end this vlog actually
we're gonna go and take the dogs for a
walk now and then we're having friends
over for dinner so I'm gonna get ready
for that so I really hope you enjoyed
