weekend and I'm with Charla's sure and
scarlatina on our way up to Manchester
demand so it was virtually meant to be
an ad strip Charlie's going on his
friends to watch the Man United versus
Lester yeah
big game but Scott and I crashed but
Scott and I are not going to the
football we're going to go shopping
I have not been into Manchester Town
Center City Center for about six or
seven years and I think has changed a
lot and I've never really been like
proper shopping there so Scala and I are
going to check out the shops and have a
nice girl
we are on reached the moment we left
home about 9:00 a.m. is half 11:00 and
it would probably about half way there
so road tripping up master very kindly
lent us their cx-5 again in which we
fell in love with when I went up to
Scotland we wanted to just get a cold
we're very comfortable in and that's you
enjoy driving do you do yeah I mean I I
forgot how good it was and how
comforting it is to drive yeah
to be fair this one I prefer once I
anymore just cuz the color the red was
nice but this is more like me like a
child
so we're enjoying the ride Donegan back
if you didn't see my vlog that I did
when we went to Scotland with master
I'll leave it up on the screen so why
are you here here because you haven't
watched it check it out it's probably
one of my favorite blogs I've ever
filmed and edited we use the drone and
we got some really lovely curves so let
me check that out
but yeah it will be an hour and a half
two hours away from Manchester so I'll
catch up with you guys so he finally
made it to Manchester we have ditched
chairs and we're finally going to make
her way to the shop so trying to find
Selfridges using city map Oh which
thankfully does work up here and yeah
we're going to go up to the personal
shopping suite hopefully they'll have
found me some nice dresses I asked them
to put some mints aside for our trip to
Italy next weekend finally made it up to
Manchester finally out of the car that
was a long journey how long were we in
the car like but we're now in the Haven
that is the Manchester Selfridges
personal shopping suite breathe a sigh
of relief and we've just given a little
brief to one of the personal shoppers
I'm looking for something gold like a
beautiful gold dress I sent over a
picture that I've seen on Instagram
saying find me something like this so
fingers crossed they'll be able to pull
some nice bits and bobs for us to try
Scarlett's looking for some gold
earrings she can wear to a wedding we're
going to tomorrow and then I'm also
really intrigued to see what I can fit
inside the Chloe Niall bag so one of the
girls just gone surfing around the store
or Scarlett and I just having a bit of a
breather in this beautiful room that how
gorgeous this is a personal changing
room for the afternoon so I think we're
gonna go and have a little look around
the store as well and see what we can
find
so we've had some shopping and I'm ready
to excited well I don't know if you can
hear it but there's a lady playing the
flute it's pride in mind they made a
party in store for us so you already got
a few bits involved so we're gonna then
take it to personal shopping really good
service you can if you're shopping at
any time you can just go to personal
shopping in Dallas because they've got a
free ruse ma'am the fitting rooms are
full or you just want another baby I
don't know why every time
professor chirping so we've got a few
nice bits so far the scholar is kind of
carrying both scarlet and is making our
way through to different professions all
my favorite storage is very convenient
from the fourth floor
we've been in circles I've been into
Mars
hello we're now in misguided I did not
even know misguided my gonna say juror
is the dress
I don't know you even got a Topshop and
all things else we got Cletus key by
Zoe's see by Chloe loads of different
bits and bobs going well
back in the fitting room and we have
pulled together all at the bits and bobs
on the back wall here and it looks like
my very own personal wardrobe which I'm
loving seeing as we're going into autumn
I probably should have picked up some
dark bits but everything is my usual
blush pink right and cream I really need
to widen my widen my horizons broadened
my horizon but then we show you the bits
and bobs I picked up so far and then
I'll do a couple of trying on sessions
so I could not resist this I have been
looking out for a circle straw bag for
so long nearly bought one in the French
markets but they were really expensive
and they didn't look to have a good
quality this one has a low heart on it
I'm not going to Hawaii any time soon
but I think it's adorable
and then if you want to wear it it's
plain and you can just kind of flip it
around pretty happy with that little
find and then these are a couple of the
dresses that we just picked up from the
store a few brands that normally I don't
go for which is why it's so nice to just
have them all in one place I've got
Sandro and really nice like a nifty
dress it's a really nice for autumn and
then this one is one that I've got in
mind for our trip to the Amalfi Coast
next weekend it's C by Chloe so a little
bit more on the pricey side but I'm
gonna give it a try hopefully it'll look
really lovely an All Saints dress I keep
seeing this on Instagram and I think it
looks beautiful
Sinead Crowe Lauren Crowe you two are to
blame for that and then also in All
Saints I saw another customer picking up
this and it was the only small size so I
was begging in my mind to how to put it
down and she did so I picked this up
it's a jumper dress and it's got like
little ruffles on the sleeves which is
the poor dress and then a couple of
basics from cause I really like lots of
basics really good price and good
quality so this is a little kind of
t-shirt with roughly
and a great t-shirts which I do already
have one of these my wardrobe it's
getting towards its last legs that's
really nice one and this little gold
necklace so so this is dress numero uno
this is a Sondra one I think this is
actually in the sale because on the tag
it says before so I'm hoping that's
before price which would be amazing it
is obviously quite a summery dress and
we are going into autumn which I guess
would be why it's in the sale but I
think it's a really nice quite classic
one so I might store this for next
summer and maybe have it for my upcoming
summer holidays really like the length
of this it's definitely the length that
I go for like just above the knee not
too revealing and yeah really nice fit
I'm not too sure about this one
it's a beautiful material nice like
autumnal colors but I feel like I look a
little bit tense like it's quite a lot
of material or scarlet and I just said
it'd be good for concealing a pregnancy
and in planning stages if ever you need
a dress for those strategies but let me
show you around so here it is as you can
see it is rather ginormous I mean I
actually do really like the style I
think it's quite a nice loose fitted
casual number well it's not really
casual actually because it's so bold I
don't know I mean I like it if I had the
occasions to wear it but I don't think I
do this is the All Saints dress I love
the ruffles it's got kind of like a
fishtail flick out at the bottom with
these little ruffle hem detail and the
ruffles and the sleeves are really
pretty as well I'm just not entirely
sure about this neckline this V I keep
thinking it's like a necklace that I've
got in the wrong place and the lining is
weirdly tight I think it's I mean it's
comfy it's quite elasticated but I just
feel like it fits me a little bit too
tightly maybe I need to try the size up
I love it but I'm not sure it's quite an
investment piece as well let me know
maybe I'll just ponder on this one I can
always order it online at a later date
so scarlet and I can't decide if we love
this one or dislike it it's very long
it's like it feels super duper stretchy
this is All Saints jumper dress the
sleeves are actually a little bit long
for me and I don't mind quite like
having my sleeves down over my hands
especially as it starts to get a bit
cold but also saying you couldn't really
eat a ginormous lunch in this because
you can see everything you can see the
outline of the stomach your underwear
absolutely everything I do love this
neckline though I really like the
ruffles thing that's really nice effect
ruins your hair when you put it on as
well um but I am looking for a nice
autumnal jumper dress I'm just not 100%
sure if this is the one
I don't know if you just saw what I just
felt because we're trying to be very
subtle I don't think they allow it
filming in that but I just ride on a
brownie blush pink Chanel boy bag and
I've never lusted so much over a Chanel
bag seriously spectacular it was however
3480 fat not one I was gonna buy like
that's maybe one to us my wish this and
a period of time but 6a I'm in love have
a new number one favorite bag
okay so I think we've done in Selfridges
the ladies very kindly putting my bits
and bobs through the till while Scarlett
and I just chill in the little lounge
area this is a much more relaxed way of
shopping I feel like after a very long
stressful car journey this is just what
we needed
so I'll show you guys what I bought till
we get to the hotel a little bit later
we are both quite packaged so we're
going to go downstairs and then yeah
zucchini juicy made me order an ice
cream so I'm gonna have an ice cream
we thought hangover cure you need
Stephen they were not my wife Stacy
looking forward to topping up on some
food also our lovely girl in personal
shopping gave us in the most beautiful
handwriting a note of recommendations
for tonight you can either scale don't
know I know anything and just so you
know Joe has the most insane we should
she comes me on my some restaurant
recommendations so I'm gonna have a
little look on Instagram and see which
one looks back
zucchini
feeling nice and energized after our
lovely snacks / feast within the
restaurant in Selfridges we've now
headed down I think is called Cathedral
Street and I didn't blocked out those
really nice stores they're like green
Ted Baker and we've come to the armed L
Center now which I guess is probably
Manchester's version of Westfield it's
like a big shopping center and we're
still on the lookout for earrings of
Scarlett and I also need to pick up a
birthday gift Charlie's man so that's on
the agenda so I felt wild Scarlett's at
the tail I could show you my outfit of
the day so my top you may recognize from
our premium horse from wreath and then

spoke about these in my Topshop full
video oneself as an exporter and then my

pleased that they now actually turn the
lights on these to us go because it
always is used in pity I am Pro ya see

double bed here I've got my bits and
bobs on that this is my new suitcase

back this does look very cozy and then
we have an amazing view sorry my battery
just died mid room tours so I will
continue I've now managed to get the
bathroom like working so I can show you
in here lovely very blog a friendly
bathroom I'm obsessed with these
ginormous like Belfast things oh I bet
Charlie has spotted thingies we are both
obsessed with this style of crockery I
think as a brand food like ghosts don't
love that and then let me show you the
view outside but - scarlet and then I
started like unpack all my stuff here
and get a better view of my lovely case
how cute are those and yeah this is the
view which is pretty amazing so we're
just about to take our makeup off and
have a bit of a pamper session I bought
a load of face masks with me I got these
through in some bloggers mail a couple
of days ago star skin I'm gonna use the
mud ones I've got quite a lot of like
blemishes on my chin and feel like I
need a bit of detoxification we've also
got a foaming peeling perfection puffs a
frightening bio cellulose second skin
sheet mask and then the VIP revitalizing
luxury bio cellulose skin face mask
okay it's a little bit later on Scott
and I have removed our facemask and
redone our makeup I've just put on one
of my new Topshop dresses that you might
remember from that my Topshop haul and
it's still growing on me the stress with
the old lady sleeves one of you guys
very kindly said I looked like a granny
dressed in this but I do not care I love
it right now I'm a great-great grandma
and I've got my little Khloe boots on I
thought I'd quickly show you what I
bought in Selfridges even though you did
kind of see me try it on anyway have
this ginormous carrier bag which makes
me look like I shopped a lot more than I
did
Charlie's back as well you have fun
darling amazing it was really amazing
seats yeah goosebumps we've all had a
wonderful day so in my giant Selfridges
bag I have I did end up getting the All
Saints jumper dress I I just find that
jumper dresses are the kind of thing
that I'll get so much use out of so this
one with the I call it like a pie crust
collar and cuff to turn on the sleeves
so yeah I used to me trying that on so
pick that one up and also we need Sandro
dress this was the first thing and also
the Sandro dress which was the first
thing that I tried on this is actually
in the sale it was over a hundred pounds
off so I feel like I got a good bargain
with that so I also got the Topshop
tassel earrings I've not seen these on
top rope calm or in any Top Shop stores
really pleased to find those might even
wear them for the wedding tomorrow and
then last but not least the cause jumper
which is here they put it in a separate
bag for me so it's all cause wrapped up
but it's the
t-shirt t-shirt with the fluted sleeves
which I thought was just a really nice
casual but stylish piece and actually I
forgot about it also it's also got the
pretty necklace wrinkles as well so got
a few lovely bits and bobs we also got a
birthday card for Holly's nan a wedding
card for tomorrow
so all in all a very successful shopping
trip
yeah
good morning so we went out for burger
and lobster last night which was delish
and now it's Sunday morning and we're
going into a family wedding so I'm going
to do a very quick get ready with me
just a real-time one and haven't done
any makeup bits and bobs for in a while
so I'm gonna start off oh I had a shower
the most amazing shower this morning
waiting for my hair to dry
I'd like 90% blow-dried it and then I
put on the Kiehl's ultra moisturizing
SPF 30 as my moisturizer this is totally
battered I really love this but the
packaging gets so messed up in your
makeup bag is the Armani Prima day long
skin Perfector and it just does what it
says on the tin so it's like a primer
that just means that your makeup stays
lovely all day so really good for a day
like today for a wedding you try to put
it on first it's kind of like a prime
number
awesome moisturizing and then it sinks
in really really quickly so you don't
have to like wait around I have a spot
in my eyebrow the most annoying thing
ever
as my everyday foundation at the moment
I'm using the girl an aqua nude but this
is quite a nude and very subtle finish
SPF 20 I've been wearing this all the
time on like trips and things but for a
wedding I want my makeup to look really
good for longer and I want a bit more
coverage especially as I'm having quite
a bad skin day so I'm using the bare
minerals bare Pro performance wear
liquid foundation this is probably my
favorite foundation at the moment and it
is obviously mineral based as its fair
minerals so it's actually over time
improves the texture of your skin which
is so good so if you just have problem
prone skin then this has so many
skincare benefits in it which I love
finish wise I'd say it's pretty high
coverage not like major major okay for
my concealer I'm using this one from
Milani it is the retouch and arei's
light lifting concealer it's really tiny
so I actually normally keep in my
handbag but I really really like it but
under the eyes
just scratching my face so I'm gonna
make it into a little bit of a v-shape
have you so good doesn't it I love it
it's quite nice and creamy so if you
have slightly dehydrated under eyes
which I kind of do
they're a lot better now that I've been
using a good eye cream and but yeah it's
just a really nice creamy finish blends
in really nicely so I start off by
blending in my finger and then to really
perfect it I'm using the Beauty Blender
so Scarlett's doing her makeup in the
mirror just that and I just said that
she should be doing her makeup here
because she's a pro adding makeup is
like basic makeup over here your
eyeshadow skills are to be desired so
because that's a little bit lighter than
my skin it just acts almost as like a
bit of a highlight as well it's a nice
way of contouring the face just very
very subtly next I'm gonna go in with my
eyebrow pencil because my brows are
scary this is the one of the new ones
from Fleur so Fleur has released a new
brow product with I leo this is the brow
define and it's kind of Anastasia
Beverly Hills and cover the name but no
the stick the pencil brow whirs yeah
yeah Bauer's and and it's actually got
two colors so I've got medium and
there's got a lighter side in a darker
side which is so good so I'm going to
start off with the darker side to kind
of draw in the line underneath my brows
to create the shape and it's a really
fine pencil as well so you're not going
to get big bold tattoo style eyebrows
and now that I've got the rough brow
shape I'm just going to add a little bit
more volume and a bit more color and
neaten them and set them in place with
the brow now from Estee Lauder it's
pretty much the same as benefit gimme
brow or whichever other one you use
sorry I just had to change my memory
card I was explaining the Estee Lauder
brow now for setting and voluminous in
my brows and it's got a really nice
small brush heads to be quite precise
with that one so I'm using it to kind of
flick up the hair almost backcombing my
eyebrows because I don't have much brow
hairs I mean to try and luminize them so
I'm going to use a couple of different
bronzers I'm going to use the hourglass
nude bronze light to give my whole face
a bit of color my usual charlotte
tilbury bronzing brush and this is my
like face warming bronzer just find the
color of this so so nice so I feel like
after dusting the hourglass all over my
face it just makes my face look a
natural color and quite a healthy color
and then to bring a little bit more
definition to my cheekbones I'm using
the Diego della Palma bronzer this one
is the wound sculpting powder so
technically it is more of a sculptor
than a bronzer and then I'm using the
Charlotte Tilbury smaller brush I don't
know what it's called that's what the
bronzer looks like that was Charlie
blowing his nose if you could hear that
I'm not terribly skilled when it comes
to contouring so my main aim is just to
make it look like I have some kind of
definition and not make my cheeks look
dirty I'm just kind of aiming it in this
general area for my ears to my mole
at this point I'm trying to put some lip
balm on so I'm going to use the Eucerin
intensive lip balm and then I probably
won't do my lipstick until after
breakfast for obvious reasons so I'll
just leaves its Beaumont for a few hours
so on my eyes I'm gonna start with the
Urban Decay Naked heat I really love the
colors in this one it's just got all the
shades that I adore from like mattes
creams to shimmering rewarm Browns and
then some Matt's darker Browns as well I
love this one which is called sourced
this one here I find that's really nice
base color and then the one next to it
chaser I like to use a little bit higher
up to almost highlight the brow love the
brush that comes in as well just give it
a quick Keane so chaser you're basically
putting everywhere so we're actually
gonna go down for breakfast in a second
so I'm just gonna whisk through the
products and I'm going to apply after
breakfast because I don't think I'll
have time to film properly so this is my
new Tom Ford eye color quad and it's in
the shade disco dust brand-new have not
even used it yet of course
but it's a really nice mix of pink and
gold so that's going to be what I'll be
using for my eyes I did the base with
the naked heat and it's just a very
neutral color but this is what I'll use
to add a little bit of drama and I will
put this in my bag I can't remember if
this is the wire sell to Shakur or the
Klan's one because all the writing has
come off but it's one of the light
illuminating sticks that will come with
me in my handbag I will be using the
l'oreal paradise ecstatic mascara this
one is really lovely I like that it's
got castor oil in this it's quite caring
for the lashes and nice and voluminous
too and then what else would I be using
oh I have this amazing palette from it
cosmetics what I love about it not only
is it personalized it's got a huge
mirror in there and then it's got a
really lovely shade of blush and
highlight as well so this is a really
nice one for traveling and obviously the
bronze are too but I've already used the
bronzer and then I really like just
swirling this brush over the - to pick
up a nice sort of shimmery blush so I
will do that properly later lipstick
wise I will probably take this one in my
handbag it's Dolce Gabanna prestige
Weybridge PMG prestige Weybridge Katy 13
oxp
is that their office yeah oh my god
we live right next to don't you governor
office apparently distribution or
something that's so funny but this is
the shade Anna and it's like a very
barmy lipstick but it really is a bomb
so great for like all day wear and then
as the party gets started in the evening
I'll switch it up to this which is a Too
Faced melted latex liquefied high shine
lipstick
in the shade hopeless romantic and it
just looks so beautiful on the lips but
it's very evening you so now just go in
the handbag and then I will finish with
this which fits the Too Faced hangover
spray the new one so it's a three-in-one
you can use this primer a refreshing
mist and a makeup setting spray
in fact I'll do round 1 now with coconut
water pre probiotic based ingredients
and skin revive errs oil-free
alcohol-free and silicone free so that's
my makeup for today we're going to go
down and get some breakfast I probably
won't blog the wedding so that's a bit
weird
but maybe I'll show you some Instagram
story tips or something we'll see but I
will catch up with you later
okay so all ready to go just about to
check out both the king street townhouse
very echoey weeks minute bathroom

we were at the wedding which was
probably the most fun wedding I think
both chai and I have ever been to would
you say dying yeah it was it was just
really good well I mean put it this way
when you've got a room of about a
hundred professional dancers and
performers yeah it's gonna be good fun
so Charlie's cousin and his now wife met
while they were both dancers on
Starlight Express yeah
so they're both dancers and perform now
in the West End
so loads of the guys and girls that were
here also dances and performance so we
had a dance-off there was a flash mob I
will insert some clips if I can some
incredible singers as well so it's
really fabulous evening makes ex-facta
Singh isn't really average doesn't
happen you have some of these guys in
there you know they're professional yeah
exactly so it's really really lovely
evening and day and I took on the non
official role of wedding photographer
and videographer we've got some really
lovely clips which so on the road again
in my memory card and a second
I just cut off mid-sentence so we have
left with me again and up in Coventry
laughs hotel checked out after a nice
breakfast and Charlie and I are now
driving back we are heading it to mr.

hopefully find Charlie's nanny birthday
presents are going out for a family meal
later and browse for us as well
I'll have 320 yards keep right on today
46 for Stratford

I'll catch up
good evening so I last spoke to you in
the car before Vista Village you are now
home again and yes I did pick up a few
lovely bits from Vista I think I showed
you a clip of me holding up a little
Mazzoni beach cover-up and I treated
myself to that I thought it was such a
lovely classic and something that's
always going to be installed always
gonna be so Mazzoni and when it comes to
Beach fashion like the trends don't
really change that much and that was
like setups an officer thought I was
great to pick that up I also bought some
bed linen from white company and a
little diffuser for Charlie's and man
for her birthday it was a really nice
experience it was very very busy but it
was of course bank holidays I'm not too
shocked didn't have terribly good
experience at the Soho farm shop though
Charlie actually found mud in his salad
and had like all straighten his teeth
who's not very nice and then Dickens is
having a sneezing fit
poor baby and then my beetroot goats
cheese and walnut salad didn't have any
walnuts in so we were both a little bit
disappointed let's say so I'm making
myself a mac and cheese now it's make up
for it's currently in the oven we've got
a wash on so it's gonna be a very cosy
chilled evening and yeah we've got the
puppies back so I'm very very happy to
have my little boys back in the house so
I'm gonna wrap this vlog up because I've
been talking all weekend
vlogging so many different slit
and it's been a really great weekend I
was just looking back at my clips of the
King Street townhouse and really want to
go back there Charlie's so desperate to
go and see more money knighted games so
hopefully that'll be our little base and
yeah loved it there great shopping
experience in Manchester so much fun at
the wedding so I really hope you guys
enjoyed spending this weekend with me
