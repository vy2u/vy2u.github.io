vlog if you're watching this on Thursday
then it means I have been unsuccessful
at getting my a sauce haul off the
memory card after I accidentally deleted
it so and yeah very very annoyed with
myself about that but if you're watching
this on Saturday and you've seen useless
haul then yay so today I'm gonna head
into town I've got lots of meetings and
I've got some really really nice events
I'm actually um well my outfit is based
on the fact that I'm going to be eating
at loads today I've got a breakfast
meeting lunch meeting afternoon tea
meeting and then dinner with Tom Ford at
the Arts Club in my dress is a tactical
outfit choice that have room but all the
food is going to be eaten today is
throwing my outfit for the day before I
leave um yeah so dress is from French
Connection I actually kind of forgot
that I had this but I owned it and it
still looks kind of creased but I still
really like it but this cute little
frilly lace hood at the bottom and then
shoes one of Dexter's toys shoes are
actually from next what the brand is
doon and you guys have seen these loads
of times before also wearing my Mimi's
sunglasses which I'm just absolutely in
love with so yeah I heading out into
town now eyebrow update it's about ten
days now since I had them done all the
scabs of the actual micro bleeding came
off though now my brows are really light
but the actual color from micro bleeding
is going to come through a little bit
more so this is the largest they're
going to be and they're going to get a
little bit darker from now on I don't
really know how it works but I'll keep
updating you anyway I am heading to the
riding house café for breakfast now so
let's go
the breakfast meeting with origins is
done
I actually went for a really unhealthy
breakfast which I already regret I had
hash brown potatoes and chorizo
definitely not the wisest decision to
start the day we are gonna head to
office right now and do a little bit
sorry I cut out a bit short because
there's some people giving me some very
strange looks but yeah and I head up the
street and do a little shopping outside
got two hours and some of my next
meeting I did actually spot some
beautiful boots in the window of Miss
Selfridge so that's going to be my first
okay so I'm in the top drop fitting room
in Oxford Circus keeping my voice down
because quite quiet in here but I'm just
trying on some bits and bobs this is the
first outfit I really like this top it's
got like this unusual kind of holes and
sleeve it's really lovely light fabric
and long almost pirate kind of finish on
the sleeves and then these blush pink
clots again really really like these
these are from the petite section look
quite nice of these shoes as well not
100% sure if I'd wear two together but
yeah big fan of these two pieces then
another pair of qalaat these are a
darker pink if you compare the two not
that dissimilar but slightly duskier
they're a bit shorter as well think I
actually prefer the length of these ones
not going to get too so I think I'm
going to go with the first pair and
finally this rather unusual pet of
sparkly trousers I'm not sure if they're
that flattering but they're so different
I really like this material incredibly
comfy because it was so stretchy you
look at that and but yeah really like
these medicinal active either
yeah 32 pounds so I think they're pretty
good value as well and potentially these
might go with my new boots
but you sort from this Selfridge maybe
with a dark top in autumn yeah so I
think I'm going to get the top the
trousers and these clots and then the
last thing I got to try is with its
kote so let's give this a go so it
actually turns out that this jacket is a
dress so it's attached there probably
wouldn't wear this as a dress I'm not
going to bother trying it on so just
going to buy these three pieces
successful trip to Topshop
just in Zara I haven't got that much to
try on so I'm not going to bother going
into the fitting rooms but I've just
fans in mirror what do you guys think of
this bag it's 30 pounds I think it's
really unusual I'm just not sure if I
need it
then I've also grabbed this top I think
it looks quite Gucci ish and especially
with this bag and this little clasp was
definitely inspired by the Gucci bags
and then I also picked up this which I
just think will be really practical for
like an airport bag and I think it looks
a lot more expensive than its certain
price tag so I think I'm going to get
the pink bag the blue bag and the top -
unless the hominins alright so long
because I find the customer service here
really bad and but yeah one looks at
sweet I thought I might as well pick up
PD pieces spoiling myself a little bit
today
so I've had to cut my shopping three
short to the time being but now got a
meeting with L'Oreal at the cafe in
Burberry or to mark a fate in the
Burberry store I've just come down to
Regent Street and that Piccadilly Circus
a moment getting all the way it looks
some tourists but I feel like I'm never
going to see these people ever again
I'm hoping I might have time to knit
back to Oxford Street to continue my
shopping spree after this but I do have
quite a busy afternoon I would quite
like to go back into violence I wasn't
too sure about that coat pink one I do
have something quite similar and I love
it so what'd you guys think
check audio online maybe let me know
lore'l meeting up on a rapist s pretty
nice lunch at Thomas
Thomas cadmium Burberry highly recommend
the chicken salad if you do if you ever
find yourself there and suddenly I don't
have time to do any more shopping so I'm
just going to another meeting now at the
Roses Hotel which is so beautiful I will
show you inside
I've got pedicure meeting actually
that's the last thing a blogger is a
pedicure definitely counts out of me
and then I'm going to two events tonight
both of which I will take you along with
me so next stop free meetings at the
Rosewood is done and now I have come to
South Kensington my next meeting is at
the Bliss Spa as I mentioned earlier
getting a Eddy colada which is going to
be really good fun and my feet
definitely need it quite funny being
back in South Kingsway used to work at
the Imperial College so feel like I've
come back into my old nesting ground
just realize the expression as the old
stomping ground
not the old masters ground
I had a lovely pedicure atlas I can't
believe I've never been satisfied I was
saying to the girls I literally walked
past there every day but I works at
Imperial College by losing every sonken
that the Bliss products obviously come
from the Bliss Spa but such a nice place
and my feet are seriously ticklish
literally I ended up like almost kicking
in the lovely lady who was doing my feet
a million times but yeah they're looking
fab now if you're very observant you
might notice I've changed outfit I put
on that first outfit that I tried on in
Topshop just because I felt like that
dress I've been wearing it all day and
it's getting really creased as well
which it wasn't a good look
so yeah I've come to cost and terrorist
I've been here before but Piccadilly
Circus is literally just up there and
I'm here for a Roger and gala event I'm
actually too early so I might go to the
bathroom and redo my makeups and feeling
a little bit glowy
until the event actually starts and then
I can only hang around for about half an
hour because then it's time to go to the
arts club for dinner with Tom Ford so a
very good evening of events
finally arrived at the Art Club for the
Tom Porter band and I found Alex it's
been cool yeah and look at this room it
is just beautiful oh my gosh
Oh
is half past eleven and I'm finally home
it's been such a long day I think I left
the house at like eight o'clock this
morning so a really really long day and
but such a fun one the tomfool dinner
was amazing and yeah just most beautiful
place I've never been to Iceland before
and it was just stunning incredible food
amazing product launch the Holiday
Collection is beautiful I knew it would
be Tom Ford just can't do a thing wrong
when it comes to beauty launches and
just those girls put on the best events
so if you guys are watching it was
incredible and thank you so much for
having us and also the company was
fantastic all of my favorite girls there
and yeah really really good evening I
thought I just quickly show you what was
in my little goodie bag because it's
just absolutely gorgeous let me show you
so as you saw in the vlog clips the
whole room was just full of these
beautiful flowers it's basically a white
hydrangea with some cream roses in there
and then there's also oh and they even
gave the bars is so it's just beautiful
and then also this little box little
gold box wrapped up in a Tom Ford bow so
let's just see what's inside so here we
have the Tom Ford Black Orchid Oh de
Parfum I was actually wearing Tom Ford
in a while this morning but I'm so
intrigued to try this look how beautiful
that bottle is contrast against the
flowers is just stunning so generous so
girls thank you so much I cannot wait to
wear this
so another busy and really fun day I
hope you guys enjoyed coming shopping
with me a little bit different for a
whole week but I just tried now and I
cannot get the air source called back
from my memory card so I'm so annoyed

well and I'm just too pissed off that I
lost it to refill mitt so I'm really
sorry and yeah I hope you enjoyed this
