every time I go to start it we get
distracted by another store and this is
third time lucky
so April and I are shopping today we've
come to the MacArthur Glen up in two
shows couple of hours from London and
we're doing some designer discount
shopping we've already made a few
purchases even and I've also never been
shopping together before and it's
already quite a laugh because now we
have the exact same taste of everything
so we've already come out the visionary
French Connection I think jumper you
nearly bought the same dress and I don't
know the top you have yeah yeah April's
brought something that I've already got
in my wardrobe
they've already been interview of our
favorite stores we just put in to coast
we've been into Karen Millen we can get
into in caramel integrase no we might
get back so yeah they've got a cashmere
cardigan which is have a needle our
names on it it was it was Oh naturally
like that April dressing for those oh my
goodness where we might go back there

little bit nippy and we've got some

making our way around there so stored
here that Bradley Craig I go we just
have been redesigned and we're picking
up some bargains really it'll be almost
but I've just wanted some bikes with
flowers on so we're going to have to you
in taste is very variable going on yeah
so when you guys come with me and show
you what nothing it's not to drive a
coalition positions rolling in my high
my vision a resolution has never been
tight everything when I think Sweden
already
this shopping center is built like a
loose so it's really really big there
must be hundreds of stores here there's
six cents per person you pay that and
not all as big as this one but why not
about the fact that this one is loose
its lightly you don't get shopping FOMO
so I really get annoyed when I go
shopping and I feel like I've missed
some of the stores because they can go
round here it means we're not going to
miss any I just brought in Mulberry
across the way so I think that's gonna
be our next stop it will just dashed
into Tom's so we're going to see if we
get happen to country I'll rather just
bar myself inside one fraction this side
you'll dark on King George
but in Mulberry and fallen in love with
this little beauty I haven't bought a
more relaxing since I worked there that
was like four years ago a long time ago
for this one and was 850 and it's now
four five five but pretty much half
price and include macaron pink ha I was
having the antique out you do run said a
good shop has punch over here I don't
know we do that yes we'll do a lot yes
and it's still here I've got tempted

beautiful so so cute I've never bought a
design back I just can't face before if
you don't know my bright pink mole brag
on stuff to sale but it's so cute I know
little here's a great surprise which is
April wants to come back here it comes
online I could get a few paychecks on
view valve we are here and if we're
going to come back you get a set of over
a girl I supposed to feel happy shopping
makes us hungry so we're going to go
around a few more stores and then we're
going to find somewhere get some lunch
next stop is grab me and I'm got barber
mug and oh I think it will weigh around
because that saw was very started this
place is like a maze yes fabulous
shopping me
what what what what what what another
fact is we just met in two fully fully I
don't actually think I've been into a 45
because I haven't no they have some
beautiful design and really really good
prices there was a bracelet that was
down to like hundred seventy-nine 235
yeah oh my goodness why should I look at
that one
yeah I think if you can see the
surrounding but it's like a beautiful
shopping your village experiences met a
baby
hello we've come on a Friday afternoon
it's school holidays and yet it's not
poking around there are certain areas
that are quite busy but yeah certain
high five a mental health event Rachel
not far from manzanita and actually glad
we live a little bit further away close
then we've been all our money
yes exactly yeah you already know the
heading to your I think um two times
we're going to go to conduct shows for
lunch
but yeah successful shopping trip so far
so we've had a lovely lunch we went to
college oh that is exactly the same
person I want to go along so the exact
same taste in everything and now we are
at this little area called the summer
social and for me this is basically my
constructive boyfriend Gulf area you can
carry on shopping and we can leave the
boys they don't have a drink yeah always
will have a drink there's a bar here a
proper bar they have beer they have
cocktails his sort of cemetery and then
they've even got a flush machine
over in the background and let you guys
decide whether this is a story daiquiri
or slash puppy they've even got nachos
so I know couple of little area and
there are areas like this or similar to
this in the other centers across the UK
maybe not exactly the same but a few
little see a little bit the mob yeah
leave the paddling pool behind me which
has it been a few degrees warmer I think
I know slight of dips mightily a deposit
all exactly and there was an inflatable
ball in there that you can like pop your
children in and push them round in the
packing you can have a little float
around take your fancy so we're just
having a little bit of downtime here
enjoying the sunshine and then we're
going to head back to the shop where
we're going to go now
I think oh thanks mr. Baker you guys
Levi's yeah I'll do so we're going to
carry on having our drank now what I was
really nice about is that when you go in
the stores it doesn't feel like Elvis
like the stimulation guys exactly and we
just wanted to thank you guys I'm gonna
we just went into Ted Baker and working
physically can't ask you to see the real
shot hold on
yes I will compare amended Karen minute
yeah I've already shot you say like
though they're like your freedom boy
yeah and then you get a really nice cry
when you look at the price tag 400 pound
off Romania is so so good so next we're
going to be a little bit dorky and how
another stationary in a chain and then
having a great little Korean to the
cruise a got a few more places to go yes
so Ava and I have just been into what's
it called the cosmetic company store and
it was basically pretty much all the
Estee Lauder brands they had Bobby Brown
star fan as the Lord of course to need
Mac and just crazy crazy discounts even
si edit which is like also quite in
review yeah brand-new they had the
origins ritual team are some of my
favorites I reckon it's worth the trip
up here just to buy your favorite
moisturizer does that entail a
moisturizer it's pretty pricey yeah
definitely worth the trip so we're just
going to last Rafa stores now we're both
in a bit of car coma after all ownership
so yeah we're going to be now if you're
on the train home
okay so finally back home again and I
didn't want to end this video without
showing you what I picked up because
I've got that post shopping buzz at the
moment from a very very good day I'm so
happy with everything i feel like i
showed you little clips in the stores
but i didn't properly show you what i
bought so I'm going to very quickly go
through those pieces with you first of
all Kurt Geiger and the shoes I got are
actually Miss kg I spoke to the shop
assistant and I said how how is it
possible that you have such amazing
stock because I don't know I just always
presume designer hours are going to have
like the leftovers or the broken ones or
the odd shoes but no this was the most
incredible selection and I picked up
this gorgeous pair of wedges you saw me
trying them on they are tan with a cork
wedge so wedge is just so practical for
some you can wear on grass can wear them
and notable stiletto not going to sink
in and then they both beautiful
scalloped edge which is kind of Kate's
baby these are 50 pounds down from 65
not the world's hugest discount but
still I'm very very happy with that
yeah I'm going to get a lot of use out
those so it's my first purchase then you
saw me trying on just beautiful bracelet
in Foley Foley and Foley Foley was one
of the tools that I've never even seen a
outlet of folly folly before and
actually I've never really looked too
much at their jewelry but this store
just was so inviting with its beautiful
sparkly lights it is look like a lovely
store so April and I were drawn in and
you just presented it just it's the same
experience as a full-price store just
everything is so much cheaper which is
what I love so much about MacArthur Glen
so this is the bracelet as you can see
it kind of comes apart so you can wear
it as a giant bangle with the like
four-leaf clover in the middle which is
just absolutely beautiful or you can
pull it apart and where it is three
separate bracelets and as separate
registers they look like little hearts
which is very very cute it was about
half price very very happy with that
the third story went in that I don't
think I was vlogging yet was nichael
Nike and I picked up a very plain gym
vest top because you always need plain
things to go one of your sports bras
this was 20 pounds down from 30 so 1/3
off and then a classic gray hoodie
because I always want something like
this to lounge around the house in and
to wear to the gym so that was another
lovely bargain French Connection was one
of my favorite stores they had the most
beautiful stocking and really good range
of sizes as well lots of smaller sizes I
picked up this pink jumper that you saw
April and I both tried on this one and
was 75 down to 29 which I'm so pleased
with think on average brands are usually
like up to 60% off produced in MacArthur
grant outlets so especially if you've
got something on your wish list from
brands like French Connection Karen and
Reese then it's a really good place to
pick up current season and just out of
season stock at a fraction of the price
it's a very very happy with this cozy
jumper and then you also saw me trying
on this beautiful dress I cannot wait to
wear this on my holidays I've got this
gorgeous floral detail at the top and
then it goes on to a beautiful chiffon
II dre lightweight skirt
- looks aptly stunning and this was a
steal as well it was 69 pounds down 420
so nearly half price really really
chuffed with that and yang went up tons
and then probably the one that I am the
most excited about is this you saw me
going into the mulberry store and yes
paper and I got very excited when we saw
this beautiful bag I haven't gone to
MacArthur Glen with the intention of
buying anything on this level but I just
totally fell in love and yeah I think
I'm going to wear this a lot so very
very excited to bring this into my
wardrobe I also love that it's wrapped
exactly as a full-price mulberry would
be so I'm very very happy to have got
the full luxury experience just bag oh
here she has my beautiful new bag it's
got the little sticker on here which I'm
going to take away so that it looks all
perfect
oh my goodness I'm so in love this is
just the most beautiful color I said in
the store it's called macaron pink which
I adore goes little postal unlock and
then bright red interior which is just
stunning
and then a zippy compartment as well
really looks like getting tickets
passport potentially got the insurance
or guarantee information and then
similar to the wire cell bag that is
like a giant opening wallet that you may
have seen in a previous call this also
has wallet like sections like it looks
like a purse here so it's got the card
slots and then just one big compartment
here which big enough my purse my phone
my charger my camera
definitely a very very good size but
also it's got this shoulder strap
very practical you can walk around
hands-free and April and I was saying we
just in love cross shoulder bags because
you can use to get there there you have
full mobility of your hands so yes very
very pleased with this it's a lot darker
and more vivid than any of the other
designer bags in my collection so yeah
it is such a beautiful piece and you're
going to be seeing this all over my
Instagram so now you know I got it at a
fraction of the retail price I think it
was normally retailing for 850 and I got
it for 450 five very very chuffed
is that discount and tenon was so yeah
that's everything that I picked up from
MacArthur Glenn April also got some
fabulous pieces I think you saw most of
them in the vlog clips she's got a pair
of shoots from her guy gir or did she
know I think she just picked up that
beautiful bag from Kirk Iger and a cup
of it from Jack Wills French Connection
so many lovely pieces I can see my
camera battery flashing nice I'm going
to wrap this up thank you guys so much
for watching and if you want to have
your own design of all then I will leave
all the information about the MacArthur
clan outlets down in the description box

stores across the UK centers but that is
all from today's vlog China I gonna

bit of an early night so thank you guys
