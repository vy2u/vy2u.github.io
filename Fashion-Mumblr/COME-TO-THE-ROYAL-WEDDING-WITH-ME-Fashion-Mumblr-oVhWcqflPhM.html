morning it is the Royal weekend today I
have a day of beauty treatments I'm
going to get my lashes done and then I'm
getting my hair colored and then I'm
getting a pedicure but first of all
heading to the gym so that I take you
along with me cuz I get a lot of
questions about my hair and not so many
questions about my lashes but I thought
it'd be interesting to show you the
amazing transformation that that
individual lashes can give you so that's
the plan today
Charlie has just left five minutes ago
for a stag do it's Sophie's fiance's
stag do today or this weekend they're
going to Dublin so it's gonna be a girls
weekend and then tomorrow morning I'm
driving super early down to Windsor to
meet Sophie and we are going to be
heading to the Royal Wedding we don't
have invitations obviously but we're
gonna go to Windsor and hopefully steal
the action so I thought we have fun that
couple of days to vlog and we cookie
show you my gym outfit before we go okay
not the man not the best place to show
you but I have got my no pain no
champagne jumper on which is from sweaty
Betty this is the best for just like
walking to the gym they're not getting
too cold and then I've got a this is
actually given to me by some skincare
company it says strong is the new skinny
and then I've got a Nike sports bra on
underneath and then these leggings are
very kindly sent to me these are pocket
sport and it is Louise Thompson from
Made in Chelsea it's her brand so I
thought these would go nicely with this
outfit they're very flattering and they
feel great so far so I'll let you know
how I get along with them I've been
unboxing my blogger mail and this is my
new obsession for just before going to
gym it smells as you can probably guess
like Estee Lauder bronze goddess it is
Estee Lauder bronze goddess but it's in
a cooling body spray so this is just
absolutely perfect if you don't want to
full-on perfume so great for the gym
even though devant la lalala la Paix
push squeeze
what about a late night
and
and back to you running back to you I'll
come running back what's been a call my
name and
bad
Ceramics
okay feeling good but a little bit sore
after a very tough workout session than
the journalist morning with Adam I'm now
heading it to lash perfect which is on
work Street in Soho to get my lashes
done so I thought I'd quickly check in
with you before to show you that before
I have nothing on my lashes at the
moment so I will catch up with you
afterwards and show you how amazing they
look after my eyelash treatment an hour
and a half later and my lashes are done
and hopefully you can see the difference
I most definitely can I had the classic
lashes which is probably the most
natural which is what I wanted I didn't
want them to be really bold and I didn't
have any makeup on so they look amazing
they've actually given me a discount
code so you guys can try them out as
well use Josie 20 when you book and can
save twenty percent so you can try them
out ahead of your summer holiday or if
you're going away but Hindu wedding may
be really really nice for them to give a
discount so just quote Josie 20 20 % off
not sponsored but it's obviously got to
be nice to share with you because oh my
gosh they look so so good I'm now gonna
head to I think I'm gonna go to Ethos
feeling a little bit healthy get some
lunch and I'll catch up you guys a
little bit
good morning it is now Saturday morning
it's actually 6:00 a.m. and I'm sorry
that yesterday's vlog and got a little
bit cut short but to be honest I got a
bit of a migraine in the afternoon and
the last thing I wanted to be doing was
picking up the camera and vlogging
however I did have a really lovely
pampering afternoon you guys saw my
eyelashes which still look absolutely
amazing I should think now look this is
good for the next like four weeks or so
I can't even feel them they feel and
look so natural they're very very
pleased about that even when I've got no
makeup on and I feel like with other
lashes that I've had before sometimes
they just look so bold when you've got
no makeup on but yeah really really
pleased with these then I went to a
salon now I hope I'm going to say this
right I think it was called a la conmigo
it was on Kings Road I'll leave the
correct name on the screen and I had my
hair colored by the lovely Paul he
really brightened up my blonde and then
the owner of the salon Johnny cut my
hair so it's a good couple of inches
shorter cuz I had quite a lot of dead
bits on the end and he's given a really
beautiful shape I will show you it
properly later
now I had a pedi I got my favourite
London Grace and that was actually a
meeting so that was really really good
this morning I've got two very nervous
looking little boys because they don't
really know what's going on we all got
out of bed yes because Charlie's away
the dog stated in my bed last night we
all got up at about quarter past five
and it's now just gone six we're gonna
hit the road and head it to Windsor I'm
a bit nervous about driving because a
beautiful master is quite a big car and
the last car I drove probably was a
Peugeot 208 I did have a little test
drive in this with Charlie a couple of
nights ago so it should be fine I've got
the car loaded I've got my coffee in my
reusable cup ready to go so let's hit
the road so made it safely to South's
house we have just done our bridal
makeup look isn't it gorgeous
and we're now just gonna film some clips
in soaps garden because she has some
wisteria blogger goals so we filmed a
makeup look which is kind of like a
Bridal makeup look and then we're gonna
head in
Windsor we've been half watching the TV
and the beckham's have just arrived to
the church so we need to get there
sharpish so that we don't miss the royal
arrival this is so beautiful
wisteria okay obviously we're gonna
survive oh it's so gorgeous right I will
fill me up the first time oh the
lighting is gorgeous
sofe and I have made into Enza so far so
calm it's okay at the moment so we're
not we're not in the car we do not hit
the castle it is so exciting and the
streets are absolutely buzzing there's
like TV studio set up temporarily either
side of us the flags are all blowing in
the wind and there's people all around
the streets trying to sell flags and
teachers and things so we're gonna just
see how far you yet I'll show you some
of the action can we grab some thank you
bye hello so can I just stocking up so
that we don't pass out and I'm here I'm
gonna get
some dairy non-stock those wedding
canapes a choice what are you gonna get
home oh yeah with Oreos
oh right good mess Oh make you Scotch
egg
sandwich cheese time
nobody in the car
so Fran I've made our way through the
long walk we have done OCR we basically
were heading for a road called Park Road
but all of the roads are closed it's now
about half twelve so Megan arrived in
some george's chapel about half an hour
ago but we were so lucky
we knew the road where the main
procession was going to be and we knew
that she was coming from Clifton the
house but what we didn't know was that
the road that we were walking on to get
to the procession road was actually on
her route so we didn't have any time to
get our cameras or our phones out but we
did actually see Megan and her mom yeah
so we saw Megan and her mom in the car
we were probably five meters away from
her we couldn't really glimpse too much
of the dress because it was just so
quick but we've been watching on soaps
phone we're live-streaming it the dress
is Yvonne she I'm sure it's all over the
newspapers by now it's not exactly
faking news coming to you from the vlog
low neckline or like a cross shoulder
neckline looks a little bit thick we
were saying the fabric looks like new
pre enormous arms yeah I think she's
trying to be very demure isn't she she's
not trying to make a statement she's
just trying to like fit in and not
offend anybody but yeah we'll make a
more informed judgment on the dress and
we feel in proper detail because we've
only seen it on a 2 inch screen so we
are heading down the Long Walk now and
the copper horses up there you've
probably seen yeah snacks and you've
probably seen the long walk in my folks
before because Charlie's mom and dad
live I mean about 15-minute walk from
here and this is where we walk the dogs
but we're heading down towards the area
of the long walk now where they're going
to the procession after the ceremony to
hope who might be able to see something
it's walking back to Sophie's mom and
dad's house and this entranceway here is
the entrance to Frogmore house which is
where they are having their reception
quite a lot of police presence around
here and if we stand here for a long
time we'd be able to see some of the
guests coming out but we're gonna go
home we're gonna watch it on the TV okay
time for a quick update slash debrief I
think the last clip you guys have seen
will have been Harry and Megan going
down at the Long Walk in Windsor so
Sophie and I got to see Megan not once
but twice today which is amazing I'm
very emotional it was just so patriotic
so many people there celebrating a
couple that we were talking to had been
there since 6:00 a.m. trying to shotgun
their spot so we were very lucky we had
just as good a view as them and we got
there like 12:45 went back to Sophie's I
look like I've been dragged through a
hedge backwards we went back to Sophie's
and we watched it on the telly we
watched like a re-run of it and oh my
god all the outfits so spectacular such
an amazing just an amazing experience
I'm so glad we went into Windsor and
actually got to like feel the buzz
because yeah even though we didn't get
the best view we still saw harrion Megan
in the flesh and it was really amazing
so yeah stayed at surfs for another hour
or so and now I'm on route to mum's
house I am really annoyed with myself
for my boys are just making us
comfortable I'm really annoyed in myself
for putting off driving for so long I
think I was a little bit nervous because
as I said I haven't driven properly in
like 6 or 7 years since moving to London
and I just thought this car so big and
it would be really hard to drive it is
not it is so easy to drive I feel like
the king of the road because I'm like up
high I mean it is it's an all wheel
drive it is a big car but I just feel
really in control I feel really
comfortable driving it I want to drive
loads more and I even as I just parked
in Waitrose to grab some food for my
dinner and I even practiced some
maneuvers in some empty car parking
spots I thought I'd make the most of a
semi empty carpark and because it's got
the reverse camera as well when you put
it into reverse you can see what's
behind your little screen it's just so
easy so
loving it I'm gonna be driving a lot
more gonna have to get one of those like
dashcam so I can probably like vlog on
the go but I'll wait till I'm like pro
driver so yeah that's the update heading
to mums now she's not there she's in
Gloucester seeing my bro and my Bros
family so yeah I'm a little bit nervous
about driving down her drives it's very
narrow stone wall drive so that's gonna
be the final test yeah I'll see you want
to get there good morning darlings so I
made it safely to mum's house yesterday
I was so exhausted after the excitement
of yesterday Soph and I realized that
we'd walked over 17,000 steps as well it
was a lot of walking a lot of standing a
lot of emotions so yeah it was
absolutely shattered yesterday ended up
going to sleep at like 9:30 I was
honestly in bed so so early so that
meant that I was up and about at 6
o'clock this morning it is another
glorious day so if he's coming over
again in a second I'm gonna show you
what will be in the future be my bride
HQ basically mum has painted her stable
and it used to be just kind of storage
but it now looks really really lovely
and that's gonna be where Soph and I
film lots of I'll be my bride videos so
that's really fun Dickie is barking at
some dog next door so apologies about
the barking in the background so I'm
just applying my makeup before cerf gets
here I am absolutely in love with the
ordinary foundation I think I was very
very late to the party with this I
couldn't quite get it in my head that
eight five pounds 70 foundation could be
quite so good but is quite literally I
think the best invasion I've ever used
it's not too thick it's not looking
quite as good in camera as it looks in
real life but it just looks very
skin-like
my god I just absolutely love it today
I'm applying it with a Laura Mercier
very dirty Beauty sponge and this one's
really good shape because the point kind
of gets into all the little areas so
yeah I'm just gonna do my makeup and
then Soph and I are filming at you're
not gonna tell you what we're filming
because it's coming on be my bride next
Wednesday we're uploading on the bridal
channel every Wednesday so please make
sure you guys subscribe to that if you
haven't already
what next makeup wise this is
amazing case from LMS and it's for their
collaboration with Lily and Lionel they
have fought out this amazing box set
with like luxury little miniatures of
the best LMS products and it comes in
this fabulous bag so definitely check
that out a leave it linked down below
and I also was watching some instruments
Tories from the event for that
particular launch which I was
unfortunately abroad for and they are
bringing out a rose cleansing balm the
pro-collagen cleansing balm is like one
my favorite products ever and they're
bringing out a rose one which is very
very exciting this by the way is the
laura mercier flawless fusion ultra long
wear concealer and I use a shade that is
a couple of shades lighter than my skin
tone this is one see and it's just great
for brightening that area a bit of
concealer this is the Clinique pep start
this is a really intense
did I say concealer I meant lip balm
this is a really intense lip balm so
it's great if you want to then blot it
off afterwards before putting on your
lip products and I'm gonna wear a matte
lip today so good to get them nourished
early on this is actually a night mask
so if you do have really dry lips then
this is a really good one to pop on
overnight as well Laura Mercier
translucent powder this is such a good
one because your skin stays looking like
skin but publicly mattified as well and
then I'm going to use this hoola bronzer
from benefit and this is not just any
hoola bronzer this is a bridesmaid hoola
bronzer which so very kindly gave to me
it also has bridesmaid on the little
brush there I actually don't use the
brush that comes with it I find it too
and gold this is the makeup brush I keep
in my handbag it is from Galan it's so
beautiful I forgot to pack a bronzer
brush with me so this is one I use when
I'm on the go it's quite dark color I
find this shade of hoola is just such a
beautiful cut I would describe it as
like a blonde bronze if that makes sense
like it's quite a warm and almost pinky
bronze shade and I just absolutely love
it on my eyes I'm feeling quite lazy and
I want to be quick so I'm going to use
the door cooling stick this
is a cooling effect I shadow and it's
waterproof
I haven't actually put that to test yet
although I did wear this a lot in the
Maldives and it's just the most
beautiful sorry about the washing
machine noise in the background
beautiful bronzy brown color which you
literally just swipe over the eyelids
and it's like an it really is cooling
it's just so refreshing to apply I don't
know if anybody's ever craved
refreshingly cool eyelids but feels nice
and then I just blend it in with my
finger I don't like to wear too much eye
makeup when I've got individual lash
extensions on um but that is the perfect
amount my handbag sized it cosmetics
brow power is my eyebrow pencil of
choice this morning and then the
hourglass brow volumizing fiber gel
that's this one here and this has little
fibers in the brush which if you have
quite sparse eyebrows like I do is great
for additional volume okay I'm just
gonna go and brush my teeth and then I
will do my lipstick okay
teeth brushed jewelry on I just grabbed
these from the bathroom because I wanted
to tell you how amazing they are
I've just used them for the first time
um but in the car yesterday I think I
mentioned that I felt that my hair was a
little bit warmer toned than I wanted
I'm not very good at describing to
hairdressers what I want I really need
to start taking pictures in but I said I
wanted like a golden Macha tone and it
was a little bit yellow yeah then I
actually wanted even though he's done an
amazing job it was just a tad on the
bright side for me but when I met the
guys from L'Oreal they gave me these
these are brand new it's their color
extend blonde age shampoo and
conditioner it says color depositing
shampoo and conditioner for toning and
strengthening now I have used a lot of
toning products in my hair and because I
really like my hair to be more of an
ashy shade which it is now this is
literally the perfect color for me and
unlike a lot of toning shampoos and
conditioners this actually
is good for the hair like it keeps the
hair in good condition because all other
toning products I've tried before leave
my hair feeling so brittle and so dry
they really like suck out any
nourishment and when your hair is
heavily colored as mine is it really
needs nourishment so I was very very
impressed with these in the shower this
morning what I did was I did a normal
shampoo using the Loreal el vivre
I think it's called the coconut oil you
know the one in the gold big bottle I
love that and I find that really
nourishes my habits totally weightless
then I used the color extend blonde egde
shampoo and I actually very very
thoroughly wrung out my hair first so my
hair was maybe like you know only 80%
wet I applied this all over and left
this on my hair while I did my
exfoliating I did my shaving and all of
that jazz so this is probably only half
of about 3 or 4 minutes then I actually
towel dried my hair so I made it quite
dry and then applied this I didn't
actually follow the instructions I don't
know if that's what you meant to do and
it says to apply to damp damp hair it
says to wear gloves so that kind of
gives you an idea of how intense it is I
didn't wear gloves and I don't have
purple hands that's okay
yeah this is a conditioner I put it from
there down and then I continued doing
pampering exfoliating my face that's
pretty two minutes and then I used my
wet brush this comes with me everywhere
it's a little handy pocket size one use
my wet brush because it's really gentle
to brush it all the way through the
length of my hand and then left it
through the lengths for another minute
or so and I mean I'm a little bit biased
when I do my hair here at my mom's house
because she has a water softener but it
feels amazing and the color it's taken
all the yellow enos all of the
brassiness out and I'm so so pleased
with this hair color it's a big big big
shout out to those products not
sponsored just big fan over here I'm
gonna finish up my makeup now I think
Sophie is not too far away so I'm going
to apply my by Terry and the light dual
powder concealer that's this one here
and I'm using enormous
a contour brush what I love about this
blush is it's got that little panel in
the middle which acts like a bit of a
natural highlight so it's great if you
just want to do one sweep and be done
and the color is just dreamy
a touch of my hourglass powders just for
any areas that need Authority setting
this is from Selfridges by the way self
just now have hourglass which is
Laura Mercier hazelnutty lipliner this
is my go-to at the moment and then I'm
going to fill in my lips with my
beautiful girl and Rouge G lipstick and
I have the shade o - which is this
beautiful nudey pink
and I'm gonna finish off with my current
favorite perfume this is Erin tuberose
Lazar not only is it just absolutely
beautiful but it's quite it's a very
different fragrance like it's not like
you know the many fragrances where
everyone kind of smells the same it's
very different I should have done that
before putting on my jewelry um very
strong it smells
I mean tuberose is quite an iconic
recognizable scent it almost if you put
too much on it can smell a little bit
sherbety so it can be a bit sweeper then
as you wear it it really warms up and
becomes quite musky and just very sexy
but also very feminine and I just love
it and it looks so beautiful
on my dressing tables there's my current
favorite there is also leisure as well
which is nice to layer for the evening
and still be like wearing something
within the same fragrance for me okay so
if he's gonna be here in 10 so I'm gonna
- round do something with my hair
and I will see you guys in an hour or so
and I'll show you around
then you be my bride HQ it's a couple of
hours later now so is here and I'm gonna
