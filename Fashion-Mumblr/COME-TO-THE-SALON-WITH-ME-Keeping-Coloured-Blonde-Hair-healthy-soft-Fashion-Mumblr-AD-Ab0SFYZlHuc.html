daily vlog I thought I bring you guys
along with me today because I've got
quite a few fun things planned and
really trying to get back into the swing
of doing a few daily vlogs so I've just
been to the gym I got back about 45
minutes ago but I didn't wash my hair so
please forgive me for my hair appearance
because I'm going to sell on it pretty
much now so there's no point in doing
lucky blow-dry so outfit of the day
please forgive my very flattened boring
hair I'm actually wearing I'm having one
of those days I'm wearing a lot of new
things so yeah I always feel a little
bit snazzy when I put on new clothes for
the first time and actually my top and
my jeans are both new so this jumper
really lovely white jumper I need to be
so careful not to get like foundation
fingers on it I don't think I've ever
had a pure white junkie before so I need
to be super careful with this one but
luckily it's got more of a skin colour
around the neckline because otherwise a
certificate of makeup and then of my new
jeans I move my bag out the way you can
see they've got this really lovely
embellishment on them it's like a load
of different gems beads all stuck on
there I thought they looked quite cool
together shoe wise oh gosh I can't even
show you guys my shoe area think I might
put on some new flats and then I'm
taking my big YSL bucket bag because
this just fit everything I need for the
day I might squeeze in a few meetings
later depending on how long I'm at the
salon forgot my notebook going to take
my little laptop so that's everything I
think I'd better get cracking now I do
not want to be late
I'm in hair paradise right now and I
just had a fabulous consultation for the
lovely Vicki and we've been going
through the energy service which we call
it it's the energy term a single service
energy code mapping service and when I
was introduced to it it kind of got me
thinking we go through so much with our
skin we really analyze our skin you
don't we and then I don't know about you
but I have such long skin care routine
you know my skincare routine serum
cleansers toners etc etc and yet we kind
of all do the same routine day after day
to our hair without thinking about our
hairs needs so that that was the first
thing that really got me thinking as
much as I can tell you about my hair and
what I'm getting done it's probably
completely different for every single
person watching this so whereas you
tailor your skincare routine this need
service from system relies on tailoring
your hair routine I've now got my own
energy code I'll leave it on the screen
here and it means it shows a different
product that my hair is going to need so
there's a hydration product yes there's
a conditioning product yet an oil
product so really personalized hair care
routine so I'm looking forward to trying
out the treatment
I'm out of the washing area I've had my
hair shampooed and now we're putting in
some of this liquid hair treatment which
is what the energy code on the iPad
recommended so what this is going to do
and the name is liquid hair is liquid
hair because what it's doing is
basically helping to rebuild the hair
structure it's filling in any gaps in
the actual structures I have with hair
essentially is that were you something
yeah Willie Allen haff which hair with
hairy reduce so hair strengthening
filter moisturizing increases because
one of the problems in my hair was at a
little bit dry and brittle which is
obviously not what I want I want a
lovely sleek smooth hair particles so
it's actually going to build up make it
look and feel nice again
all right I've had my hair wash another
time and the liquid hair examined rinsed
out we're going to put on some of this
color save by phase conditioner so this
one you have to shake it up to mix the
two bits of the liquid all together
and this is going to help to fight any
color fade color protect and also
condition the hair ok so just come out
of the salon after my treatments and I
wish you guys could feel my hair right
now it is so soft and also I feel like
the color looks about three stage life
is frozen largest on my calorie done I
haven't used a conditioning treatment so
my hair very very fused to the results
the treatment that I just had you can
have in any weather salon and you can
add it into a blow-dry treatment you can
add it into a coloring treatment or you
can just go in have it done if you just
want to top up the condition of your
hair
such lovely service the lovely guys at
Weller have also said that I can give
away three of these Patrick
you guys so I'm going to tell you a
little bit more about the competition
when I get home because I'm getting all
kinds of strange looks logging in public
so I'm going to head home now and you
film some videos this afternoon to make
the most of my five minutes hair not
going to let her go to waste
so I'll catch up with you guys in a few
moments and I'm back home ok back home
again sorry that last bit of vlogging
one's a little bit gibberish but I got
so nervous vlogging in public that
normally I must lean and that may be
because there are just so many tourists
in Trafalgar Square I was getting so
many strange looks and so source what I
said made no sense whatsoever I just got
home and I'm feeling far too glamorous
to be stuff at home so I think I'm going
to definitely film a couple of videos
this afternoon to make the most of my
fabulous hair I really wish I could do
this myself I definitely picked up a few
tips from Bruno though so Bruno is the
president of a British hairdressing
Association there's a huge privilege to
have my hair done by him so yeah thank
you very much Bruno I'm Vicky it was
just so interesting spending time with
them beause they are whether
ambassador's so picked up so many tips
but yeah what I also said don't you
caught it when I was out earlier was
that when I have said that I can give
three of you guys the opportunity to win
the treatment that I've just had or more
specifically you can win a treatment
that's best suited to your hair so I was
saying that the treatment that's good
for me may be completely different to
the treatment that's good for you that's
the whole point of filling out the
questionnaire talking to a hairdresser
or completing the questionnaire online
because it really tells you what
products are most suited to your hair
it's real bespoke hair care experience
so if you want to be able to chance of
winning this treatment which I highly
recommend my hair feels ridiculously
soft it feels also really clarified like
there's no weight in it what I used to
really struggle with is my hair feeling
like it is way down felt like there's so
much product Manners breakage those
dryness but it feels so so healthy and
I'm so glad that you can do it at home
as well you don't just have to go into a
salon but if you want to win that the
opportunity to have this treatment
yourself then you can basically find
your own energy code so I'll leave a
link down below to a website where you
can do it create your own and
code let me know in the comments below
what your unique energy code is and also
let me know an amazing hair experience
that you either have had in the past
year or that you're going to have in the
next year so are you going to be getting
married this year or are you going to be
cutting off all your hair for some
amazing reason or just tell me a
fascinating fact about your hair from
either this last year or the year that's
coming up so I can learn a little bit
more about your one year of energy so
yeah that's pretty kind of weather so
let me know in the comments below and
then in another vlog coming up I will
let you know who the three winners are
sent good luck yeah we're back home now
that'd be my little sausage he's
charging around like a mad dog coming
from the hair doesn't look well actually
he is dyeing his hair gray so I'm really
intrigued to see what he what he looks
like when he comes back he said he's a
little bit nervous so yeah we're both
having amazing hair experience of today
meanwhile I'm going to have some lunch I
just picked up some soup from Waitrose
got a vegetable and pearl barley
fascinating stuff so I'm going to make
myself a late lunch it's half-past three
now and I'll catch up with you guys
afterwards and I'll show you my filming
setup ok slight change of plan I don't
know if you can tell probably can't from
stood right by the window
but it is so dark today's only three
o'clock and yesterday at 3 o'clock is
bright blue skies but today it feels
like the middle of the night it is so
dark so I'm not going to film because I
don't really want to put out another
yellow tinted video from having too much
artificial lighting so I think despite
having a good hair day I'm hoping it's
going to last and be this fabulous
tomorrow because tomorrow morning is
scheduled to be sunny I just checked
about the forecast so hopefully I'm
going to actually see some of those
videos tomorrow so for today I think I'm
just going to make the most of being at
home and I'm going to get a little work
done I've got lots of blog posts to
write I've got several rounds the videos
that need editing so I'm going to have a
really productive afternoon some of the
benefits of being your own boss you can
kind of decide what needs to be done I
have a massive to-do list but if I can't
do one thing like if I'm I'm not in a
mood to do emails and I can
editing if it's not bright enough to do
videos I can do emails by first etc etc
so yes time will not be wasted editing
and one way cameras want to focus on me
today so yeah I'm going to have a little
bit of a Productivity session and then I
will speak to you guys again shortly
when I have time I'll show you his hair
and yeah so I'm going to crack on some
work I'll catch up with you guys a
little bit neater so I'm beginning to
get a little bit concerned about Charlie
because my hair normally takes like five
hours when I get it colored he left the
house at 12 o'clock and it's currently
half past five and he has a lot less
hair than me so are they putting in
extensions I really do not know but I've
had a very productive afternoon I have
pretty much conquered my inbox over in a
blog post and I've also completed a few
description roxas my youtube channel
all the while accompanied by a certain
somebody so it's only productive
afternoon not anything to you guys now
I'm afraid I think I'm going to go dong
shortly you enjoy gets back take up some
blogger mail so yeah I will show you
what is there so we about Charlie dough
won't us is that point hopefully the
next time you see me I'll be with him
and I can show you his new hair so it's
a couple of hours later and finally I
have my two boys home charlie is back
with his new hairdo shows darling it's a
little bit old it's not that obvious on
camera but Charlie's basically gone a
little bit more gray how many darling
yeah great so how do they do it
bleach it I look like Eminem from how
often I'll actually quite liked it for a
one-off like painter it look like oh we
can somebody unattractive yeah we're all
lying on the sofa with Dexter in the
crook of Charlie's arm relaxing it's
only about half past seven but we're all
fairly natural so I think try and I
going to have a super duper early night
I'm probably going to go and do some
face masks and finish watching Bridget
Jones baby because that's sort of been
watching for the past couple of nights
and we both got an early start tomorrow
so I think I'm going to end the vlog

competition that I mentioned earlier
