me for today's video it's going to be a
very different one from me today this is
not gonna be a normal daily vlog or
fashion video but today I'm actually
partnering with PNG to support their
feel super campaign so this is something
they've been doing for the past few
years and they are bringing it back so
today Charlie and I are going to be
completing some really fun challenges to
support the feel super campaign
basically what it's all about is PMG are
helping and very curious to mary curie
throughout the month and i'm gonna let
you know how you guys can get involved
as well and this is something that that
china I really wanted to do Mary Curie
is a charity that is very very close to
my heart
they look after terminally ill patients
and their families and for my mom and I
especially we were so grateful for the
support of Marie Curie nurses when my
dad was poorly the nurses would come and
stay in our house and they would support
us both mentally and physically and it
was just something that we are eternally
grateful for so it's a charity that I've
supported for a long time so when PNG
said that they were going to be doing
this campaign again we jumped at the
chance to work with them since PNG
started working with Mercury they have
already raised over 500,000 pounds which
is absolutely incredible and until the
end of this month when you buy any of
your favorite PNG products from
superdrug you will be making a donation
so for every product fort
they'll be making a donation on at your
behalf today Charlie and I are going to
be putting the fun back into fundraising
and completing a series of challenges so
before Charlie and I complete our
fitness challenges and actually Charlie
decided that you all didn't do fitness
challenges I'm going to just very
quickly show you a few of my favorite to
PMG products to hope you inspire you to
head down to your local super drug and
pick these up if you need a top-up of
your favorite conditioner your favorite
moisturizer your razor now is the time
to do it because you can just by buying
your favorite products you can be
donating it to my curate through PNG so
just a small selection of my favorites
this is just to give you
some ideas of what you can pick up Olay
is a skincare brand that we all know and
love and when you buy any of their
products throughout the month the
donation will be made this is the
anti-aging cream if you're not quite
ready Fanta aging then perhaps picking
up your mom and then there's also the
classic seven in one Total Effects
moisturizer you've also got Pantene hair
products this is the 3 minute miracle
amazing if like me you've got colored
hair needs a bit of deep conditioning
Herbal Essences as well at the
best-smelling hair products in the world
they are all included and then there's
also oral-b this toothpaste is epic that
whitening teeth if like me you're a
coffee lover and you don't want to have
stained teeth this is fabulously and if
you want to go all out you can even buy
yourself a new - fresh from oral-b this
is their vitality plus cross action
electric toothbrush boys there's
Gillette Head &amp;amp; Shoulders obviously
girls can use Head &amp;amp; Shoulders as well
so why not this afternoon after work
head to your left Superdrug or if you
don't have one nearby you can also go to
super drug calm any of your favorite PNG
pieces until the 24th of April so you've
got plenty of time to do some shopping
one product purchase is one donation so
why not you don't have to pay anything
extra but you're donating it to a
fabulous cause so as I mentioned Charlie
and I are putting the fun back into
fundraising today and we're going to
doing a feel super challenge we're going
to find out who's the field super
champion and we're gonna be doing some
fitness challenges so Charlie has
designed along with our personal trainer
Adam a series of kind of workout
challenges so who can do a plank for the
longest you can do the most burpees in a
minute that kind of thing so let's give
this a go I'm excited but nervous but
let's do it
so that's Chinese chase you're only
gonna be competing through something is
how many things we did in one minute one
minute guys
halfway guys
come on let's go 15 seconds - that was
tough this next one I think I'm gonna be
better though we're gonna do one minute
more as long as possible you do six so
that's a key
so the challenge number three is the
most box jumps we can do it a minute
before so I'll be good at first setting
a nice big total the joist master
three two one and go
Oh
we're going to do a plank challenge
so it's neck-and-neck of the two
challenges each oh and it's gonna be a
sprint finish 15 seconds on the skill
mill who can do the fastest speed and
hold that speed for longest let's do it
very
Jim how's it feel to be there feel super
number one number one feels good yeah
yeah I mean I'm gonna be humble I'm not
gonna rub it in your face
no burning after that challenge do you
know what the burpees was the most
brutal actually because well I actually
managed the Burpee every two seconds
which is quite impressive but yeah the
burpees wisdom was the worst wife ah
very good
quite a good little workout Miami people
should do that workout okay yeah and
what you didn't see is that we also did
another half an hour with our personal
trainer before that so equally W is
knackered so we are going to celebrate
with a nice healthy lunch on the high
street what's more we going we're going
to mommy which is Japanese place very
nice and in my bag I have the feel super
crown it's an amazing crown made out of
daffodils because the daffodil is the
flower of Marie Curie so I feel like
Charlie's not gonna want to sit there
eating breakfast wearing a floral crown
so I'm gonna take one for the team be
the honorary winner honorary champion so
let's go and get some nice healthy
French
okay so back home again after a
successful morning's challenge even
though I was not the winner of the
fitness challenges I think the charity
challenge we're all winners so that's
just my way of saying I want to wear the
flower crown I have this fantastic crown
it's just been that's so beautifully
made it's just a green wire with
daffodils and yellow I think they're
ranunculus I'm not sure I'm sure any
passionate florists out that will be
telling me exactly what's on here but
I'm gonna crown myself Charlie may be
the winner of the challenge but this is
my prize literally every instagramers
dream I'm gonna go outside and take some
cute photos wearing my new daffodil
crown so thank you guys so much for
watching and don't forget you have until
the 24th of April to go and pick up your
PNG products from Superdrug and a
donation to a man Curie will be made on
your behalf
