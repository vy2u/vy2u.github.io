me for today's video it's going to be my
very belated March favorites so I'm
afraid I didn't get this up towards the
end of the month or even early April
because I was a little bit poorly last
week I took maybe a week off and today's
my first day filming in about two weeks
actually so forgive me if I'm a little
bit rusty and you're probably thinking
hang on a minute we saw a video from you
just a couple of days ago and that's
because I massively
pre filmed a load of content from my
fashion mumbler spring edit and I was
planning for all of those spring flamed
videos to be back-to-back all over the
space of a week and really like banging
loads of spring content but because I
was poorly and not filming anything I
decided to spread them out so that is
that's that and today I'm gonna be going
through all of the things that I have
absolutely loved throughout March and
the beginning of April because we're
nearly halfway through the months now I
cannot believe how time flies and it's a
real mixture of beauty and fashion
pieces I'm gonna very quickly before I
get started though say thank you so much
to everyone that has joined my channel
recently we have seen lots of new
subscribers since the launch of the
spring edit so if you are new then
welcome thank you very much for joining
us and I hope you are enjoying the
content and if you don't know what I'm
talking about with the spring edit then
I will leave the fashion mumbler 2018
spring edit linked down below
basically loads of spring cleaned
fashion content ranging from an under
50-pound haul to what investment pieces
to choose for spring - how to carry out
your wardrobe for spring
there's loads and loads of content and
final notification if you guys are not
yet subscribed then please do and also
it's just a little button that down at
the top of the description box and if
you are subscribed then please hit the
notification bell and you have to press
it twice so that you always get notified
when I post a video it's not annoying
it's just like an Instagram notification
and basically the reason why I ask is
because a lot of you have been letting
me know that you haven't realized when
my videos have gone up because YouTube
is now being really weird with how it
tells you which of your YouTube channels
you've subscribed you have uploaded so
you don't always get notified unless you
have an
Bell turned on really weird so just
click the little bell and let me know by
leaving the word Bell in your comment
down below if you have done that because
that would be amazing
okie dokie so my first favorite of the
month of March has to be the fashion
mumbler presets so I launched my own
range of Lightroom presets in March and
it was so that you guys could get the
same lovely effect on your photos for
Instagram as I use on my personal
Instagram and I've been using these
presets and they're basically like a
filter in Lightroom which is part of the
Adobe Creative Suite I'll leave a link
to Lightroom down below as well for on
my Instagram for the past 18 months or
so and it's basically my super easy way
of making sure all my photos look the
same that they all look really
professional really light bright and
kind of pink as well so I decided that I
would sell my presets a whole bundle of
them for you guys to enjoy and use as
well to help you up your Instagram game
or make your blog photo editing easier
make your video editing easier and you
guys absolutely love them I have really
enjoyed looking at the fashion mumble of
presets hashtag and seeing how you have
been updating the Instagram using them
if again you don't know what I'm talking
about
I'll leave the video where I explain all
about the presets and also the link to
buy them down below and if this video
has inspired you to buy them then I have
a little 20% off code for you leave the
word YouTube favorites in the box at the
checkout and you'll get 20% off so
that's my my little trick to you guys
for watching today's video another
favorite to mention because I'm wearing
it so I know that I will forget if I
don't mention it early on is the Pandora
shine jewelry collection so Pandora is a
jewelry brand that we all know and love
and for me their new shine collection is
my favorite collection they've ever done
it is so me my favorite piece has to be
this honeycomb ring I'll insert a
close-up of it here as you can see what
it looks like probably I've been wearing
this throughout pretty much the whole of
March and April so far and I just love
it I think it's so effective so
beautiful really different as well and
it's nice I feel like it was about time
I switched up my jewelry so yeah big fan
of that I've also been wearing the honey
covering where this one's called like a
honey hexagon ring and also their crown
ring
this necklace I've had for a long time
all Pandora and leave them links down
below as well but yeah that is a huge
huge favorite of mine this month and
then I have a couple more accessory
favorites these I picked up recently
from H&amp;amp;M and I actually have a pair of
Cloe sunglasses really really similar
but I thought these and I have actually
got my hair stuck in them I thought
these were fabulous and I think they
were around $7.99 I will try my hardest
to find the link to them down below but
normally I don't have too much look on
the HTML website I did buy these in the
Regent Street store but I just love them
I feel like they are so on trend for
like sunglasses trend for this time of
year round bags round sunglasses that
kind of 60s vibe is just absolutely huge
at the moment of course I love the color
they're pink which is just you know
everything that I love in life and their
rose gold so they just took all the
boxes super affordable and they will
definitely be coming with me on my
upcoming travels speaking of affordable
accessories it would be no surprise to
any of you that follow my Instagram that
I'm including my top shop round bag in
my March favorites this bag is 28 pounds
which i think is incredible such an
affordable way of adding that circle
back trend to your spring and summer
wardrobe it instantly just updates an
outfit I have worn this for again for
the past month six weeks or so and just
every time I wear it and post on my
Instagram you guys just want to know
where it's from and people just can't
believe me when I say it's 28 pounds
because it really does make your outfit
look so expensive and I do have a video
all about making it outfits look more
expensive coming very soon as I kind of
follow up to my how to look expensive
video which hits a million views this
month insane I'll also leave that one
linked up on the screen but yeah this is
a really affordable way of giving your
outfit a real boost a real boost of the
trends a real boost of making and look a
little bit more luxurious it also has a
crossbody strap but to be honest I
usually wear it just handheld also from
Topshop I absolutely fell in love with
these shoes this month they are a pair
of pink mules and they're pointed so I
feel like they look a little bit like
Aladdin's slippers a tiny bit like my
Nicholas Kirkwood badger flats that I
absolutely adore and then I love this
little gold around here
I think that gives them such a beautiful
finish they were I think they were
around 65 pounds so not mega mega
affordable but I always think Topshop
have a perfect balance between price and
quality I always seen a really good
value these are super soft leather very
very comfortable I wore these for a lot
of walking in Vienna I explored all day
in them and found them very comfortable
and because they are so open and easy to
wear I think they go with so many
outfits so definitely a no-brainer when
it comes to including these in my
monthly favorites and then we're
whizzing up to something a little bit
more high-value for my next accessory
favorite and is my new Valentino rock
stud sandals so I did mention in my
under 50-pound haul in fact I have them
here these dupes that I got from
misguided and I love these as well and
if your budget does not stretch to these
or you just don't want to spend the
money on the real deal then these are
amazing from misguided I will leave them
the link down below 35 pounds but my
heart is firmly with the Valentino once
the color of these is just perfect I
have got a lot of metallic accessories
and I find that metallics are often a
bit of a neutral I actually wrote a
whole blog post on how to wear metallics
I'll leave that link to down below as
well this is gonna be a very chunky
description box but because they are a
metallic kind of rose gold I finally act
as a mutual piece and that means that
they go with so many things which is
really important to me when I do invest
in a designer piece I want to get loads
of wear out of them so I find that this
color is very very versatile because of
all the straps they don't move around on
my foot my foot is firmly in place so
they're very comfortable low chunky
block heel really easy to walk around in
all day as I have done on several
occasions again it's the kind of
accessory that instantly makes your
whole outfit look more expensive if you
want to wear head to toe Primark
head-to-toe Topshop and then just a
designer accessories such as a pair of
shoes like this instantly it just makes
your whole outfit look a lot more
luxurious and if you guys have watched
my previous videos you'll probably have
heard me saying how my Valentino Rock
studs with the pointed closed toe are my
best investment I wear them so much so I
thought that these were kind of along
the same lines and hopefully I'll get
almost as much wear out of these two one
more fashion favorites and I feel that
this could be a bit of a Marmite piece
as I mentioned when I first introduced
it to you guys it is my gold
metallic leather jacket now this is a
kind of piece that you will either love
or hate and personally I've never loved
a leather jacket before but I've always
kind of wanted one in my collection I
feel like they are a real classic and
when I did a wardrobe staple video I
asked at the end what your wardrobe
essentials were and so many of you came
back with a leather jacket but I was
like I don't have one I have never
fallen in love with one before until I
saw this if there was ever to be a
leather jacket that I would fall in love
with it's absolutely this one it's
almost rose gold but not quite got the
same pinky tone it's just a very
wearable not too yellowy not too pinky
just the most perfect golden shade it's
from caramel and not sure if I mentioned
that the quality is absolutely fabulous
and I feel like it instantly he just
adds so much Wow to your outfits I love
it so so much it photographs beautifully
great for this time of year when you
want something around your shoulders but
you don't want to be too hot and bummed
up in a coat we are going to Texas in a
couple of weeks time so this will be
great for in the evenings when I want
just a little bit of extra warmth and
it's most definitely a statement piece
so big big fan of this and yeah just so
excited to wear it's so much more so now
moving on to beauty favorites and the
first is the first product that I apply
after cleansing and toning in the
mornings and it is from Shiseido and
this is actually their first piece of
skincare that I've tried and that's just
reminded me I also have from there was
au range which is kind of their
Millennial range a facial exfoliator
which I was meant to include in this
favorites as well so I'll also leave
that link down below because it's
amazing I digress this is called the
ultimen power infusing concentrate this
is a kind of product that basically
works at the MIT to make the rest of
your skincare do its job really really
well it prepares the skin in a perfect
way to absorb the ingredients from your
serum from your moisturizer it helps to
balance out the skin and just generally
give you a good skin day every day I
have been using this I've say six weeks
now and my skin has never been better
behaved I would say it's the best way of
describing it you know when you just
wake up and your skin's great it's not
dry it's not super oily it's just
balanced it's just happy skin is the
best way to describe it and considering
I've been eating
comfort-food having been ill and yet my
skin has still been good I think this is
a very powerful product a big big fan of
this from Shiseido and then a couple of
base products and I still owe you guys
an everyday makeup routine but I have
been doing my makeup in vlogs quite a
lot so definitely watch my vlogs if
you'd like to see how I'm doing my
makeup at the moment I just yeah being
poorly does not lend itself to doing
makeup routine videos however I must let
you know that I have been loving at the
Bourjois healthy mix foundation this I
feel like I fall in love with it this
time every single year I think in my
last couple of spring makeup routines
from previous years I have featured this
it does what it says on the tin it gives
your skin a really healthy luminous glow
it's got a beautiful light weight
coverage and yet it does cover any
redness is long-lasting it makes your
skin look really fresh and just
everything that you need at this time of
year it's got the vitamin complex so
also great ingredients for your skin
care as well very affordable and also
long lasting so just tick tick tick with
this one next is another base product
and it is the Laura Mercier flawless
fusion ultra long wear concealer so I
was really kinda sent a huge selection
of these the shade ranges are absolutely
amazing the one that is perfect for me
is one see which kind of sounds like
it's probably one of the lightest ones I
use this mostly underneath my eyes I
find that it doesn't crease it is as you
can guess by the name very very
long-lasting and it blends really well
with not only my skin but also the rest
of my makeup which is so important I'm
not particularly skilled when it comes
to creating like a perfectly illuminated
contoured look so for me I want my
concealer to do its job and just work
really really easily and that's exactly
what this does now I don't know if it's
technically too early to include this
because with skincare
I like to only really rave about
something after I've used it for about
three weeks whereas I've only been using
the Elemis procoach and overnight matrix
for about ten days but already I can
tell this is going to be a huge huge
favorite I'm already a big fan as you
guys know of the whole Pro collagen
range I used some moisturizer I use
their face oils I just love it so much
it's just fantastic for the skin great
for anti-aging great again for keeping
the skin looking lovely luminous lovely
and bouncy very balanced huge fan and
this is the newest addition to the range
Elemis invited me into
their house of Elemis which is in
Mayfair for a facial to experience this
for the first time and it was one of the
best facials I have ever had
I fell asleep into such a deep relaxed
neat sleep that I was majorly snoring
and I feel sorry for the therapist but
this was just the most heavenly product
to try out within the facial the smell
of this with all the fabulous
ingredients is just absolutely divine
it's one of these products that you want
to rub in your hands and inhale before
you press it onto your skin it smells
very botanical almost kind of herby just
very very spa-like very relaxing so what
makes us so special is of course it has
all the benefits for the pro-collagen
range but it also has something called
drone peptide technology in it and what
I believe that to mean is that it has
technology inside that means that it
really targets the specific concerns
that your skin has instead of just
whacking on the anti-aging or whacking
on the I don't know brightening effect
it finds what your skin needs and it
works on that specifically which is
probably why it works for so many
different skin types I've heard of other
vloggers that are already raving about
this - for me I just noticed mostly that
brightens makes my skin look a lot more
awake a lot more fresh and like I
mentioned with the Shiseido product
that's combined with this means that I
wake up with great skin in the mornings
and it's just such a pleasure to apply
order wise I apply this after my night
oil I've been mixing up the elements
superfood oil and the pro-collagen
marine oil and also the neon face oil I
also really like that one but this is
now always my final step so big fan of
this and also keep an eye on my
Instagram because this is going on LMS
as part of the today's special values so
you can get this at an amazing price
with a huge bundle of other products I
think it's going out on the 14th of
April so keep an eye on my Instagram so
I'll be doing an announcement for that
but yeah huge huge fan of this something
else that I've been applying before bed
is this from YSL the official name is
the veloute the loop day night rehab lip
mask I'm sorry oh so hard for me to read
it so tiny and but this is a lip mask
that you apply just before bed basically
a very nourishing very intense lip balm
but I personally hate having to dip my
finger in a lip balm I find that I get
lip balm under my nails it's just not an
enjoyable
experience yours this is very much an
enjoyable experience firstly it tastes
and smells amazing I would say it's kind
of watermelon II oh my goodness it is so
fresh it makes my mouth water and I'm
creating a cocktail whenever I smell
this also it's a doe foot applicator
hopefully you can see it there so it's
just super easy to apply on the lips
gives a very very soft pinky white color
but who really cares when you're about
to go to bed and also the packaging of
this is absolutely beautiful so I've
been really enjoying this any more
products to go and this one has been a
real indulgent pampering treat this
month something else that smells
absolutely incredible it is the molten
brown orange and bergamot radiant body
polisher I've always loved molten brown
body polishes I think they are very
effective firstly the granules are the
perfect size this one I think is walnut
pieces bitter oh no this one is apricot
kernels it's the perfect consistency
that's not too abrasive on the skin but
you can definitely feel it work and you
really feel like your skin is very
buffed and smooth after using it the
smell of this one orange and bergamot oh
my goodness I think if you oh my gosh I
think if you're a fan of the I
definitely just dribble that because I
just craft it straight out the shower I
think if you're a fan of the neuron G
range and I know that so many people are
like cult followers of the inner energy
smell it's not similar necessarily but
it's along the same vibes
I find your ng so fresh and just so
amazing to have in the house and this I
think is exactly the same it's very
awakening very very fresh and so an
absolute pleasure to buffer the body
with this is part of my pre tanning
routine I do find that I get through
them really quickly which is very sad
because obviously they do have a premium
price tag but just a major major treat
absolutely love them these make amazing
gifts as well whenever it's my mom's
birthday I treat her to something from
Alton Brown and I know that this
birthday it will be one of these
following that I have to tanning
favorites I'm kind of bundling them into
one mostly the la Mer face and body
gradual tan I am a huge huge fan of
gradual tans I find it very easy to
maintain a lovely glow all year round do
sometimes give it a bit of a mystery
winter but now that I'm starting to wear
short sleeve items and yes getting my
legs out I do find that I want to be
consistently bronzed
as opposed to the peaks and falls of
thick tanning and then super pale fig
telling them super pale I find that
gradual tans are a great way of having a
nice color all the time and this is my
current favorite it is a premium product
of course it's from the mayor so to
counteract that I would say this is an
investment piece if you can afford it
then it's amazing but I also love budget
ones as well I find Garnier is fabulous
I find that Sienna X is great as well
but to be totally honest my current
favorite at the moment is this one I
find it goes on really well it sinks in
super quickly
it smells gorgeous and the tan I think I
haven't done it in a couple of days but
it's just such a lovely natural color I
never get any streaks I never get any
telltale signs and it's just so nice to
be confident with your tan enough that
you don't need to worry about preparing
the skin the day before you put a skirt
on for example this it's nice to be
consistently Brown so this is something
that despite the price tag I will
continue to repurchase because I am a
huge huge fan recently I have had quite
a few people actually complimenting me
on my tan from my face and they have
been asking what I'm using and on my
face at the moment I'm using the Isle of
paradise light
self-tanning drops so these are from a
new brand out of paradise which is
created by the incredible spray tanner
and just all-around fabulous personals
form half he's created this brand is
organic cruelty-free
it's got fabulous ingredients in there
such as chia seed avocado oil he's
basically put all of his expertise from
many years of tanning into this range I
am using the tanning drops it does
actually say to put a few drops in your
moisturizer and build it up that way but
I've been putting these straight on my
face and then washing my hands right
early afterwards I'm very impatient but
that is what works me so before my
moisturizer I give it about 10 minutes
after applying this before putting
anything else on I have got the color
light which is probably why it works so
well in that way there you go you can
see the lovely bottle very very
photogenic and pretty packaging and it's
just a really nice way of consistently
having a glow to my face as well so yes
very big fan of that one great new
launch well done that Jules you have
smashed it last but not least a new
fragrance favorite and this month I have
been loving the German own London
jasmine sambac and
marigold fragrance this is a Cologne
intent so it is their slightly higher
price point but I think that what you
get for that is such a strong powerful
scent you literally only need one spritz
of this and you smell divine
the entire day this is a very warming
scent I would say it's both masculine
and feminine wash I feel like I cannot
do it justice with my words but
definitely try this out if you can if
you happen to be near any German in
London boutiques but yeah for this time
of year I think it's perfect because
it's fresh but also warming at the same
time and it's just absolutely amazing
and they want this to my signature
perfume is just love it so much so those
are my favorite pieces from the month of
March and the beginning of April as well
I would love to know what you guys have
been loving throughout the past month so

your favorite beauty item and favorite
