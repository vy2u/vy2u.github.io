me for today's video it has been quite a
long time since I filmed a video at home
and my video schedule has been a little
bit all over the place lately due to
travelling quite a lot so I'm sorry
about the messed up schedule but we are
back on track now usually on Mondays I
post a vlog this week is gonna be
getting back into the swing of things
and then we will be back to normal with
so much spring and summer fashion
contents coming your way I have filmed
so many amazing fashion videos for you
so stay tuned if you haven't already
subscribed then please subscribe I
promise you you are gonna love the
videos coming up I'm so excited to share
them today I'm just gonna catch up with
you guys by telling you all about the
products that I have been loving
throughout the past three or four weeks
throughout the month of April and the
beginning of May a lot of these are kind
of travel and summer themed because of
the trips that we've been on so since I
last filmed a proper video Charlie and I
have been to Mexico to learn we've been
to Dallas in Texas the Maldives and also
most recently would come back from a
Malfi in Italy so a lot of these are
very much inspired by my travels the
first favorites of the past few weeks
however has got to be be my bride which
is a new YouTube channel vlog and sets
of social channels all about wedding
content as you may know I fairly
recently got engaged and I wanted to
have an outlet for Bridal content but
not fill this channel with too much
Bridal context I know that not all of
you guys will want to see it so I
decided with one of my best friends who
I'm actually a bridesmaid for this
summer Sophie we have teamed up to
create a bridal youtube channel blog and
whole community called be my bride and
we launched it a couple of weeks ago and
that is definitely my favorite thing of
this month I'm gonna insert a little
teaser of our intro video now
so you can see the kind of vibe that be
my bride is going to be it's a very
romantic channel all to do with
everything for weddings so wedding
dresses is going to be travel there's
going to be wedding guests outfit ideas
and it's going to be a community not
just a channel all about me and my
wedding so if you love that kind of
content and if you want to keep
up-to-date with everything that I'm
thinking about for my wedding
then I would love it if you would
subscribe and follow the channels I'll
leave all of them linked down below so
that's my first favorite thing off the
last few weeks the next favorite is a
fashion piece which I'm going to talk
about quickly now because otherwise I'll
forget it's currently downstairs on the
drying rack because I wore a lot in a
Malfi we only got back a couple of days
ago
so I don't have it physically here to
show you but I'm going to insert a photo
bit on the screen now this is my new
jump suit from Club Monaco I bought it
in Dallas in one of the malls in Dallas
and I have worn it so much Clare Monaco
pieces are obviously fairly pricey and
I'm always very conscious that I want to
get a lot of wear out of them so I wear
pieces that I can visit wearing on loads
about coming trips here in the UK as
well and this piece is just so so
stylish it looks great too the way of
sandals with flats with wedges and it's
the kind of piece that suits so many
dress coats as well I feel smart wearing
it but also I never feel overdressed
super comfortable it looks great and
that is definitely my first fashion
favorite over the past few weeks so I'm
going to stick with Tory Burch to show
you my next couple of recent favorites
and it is these two pairs of shoes again
picked these up in the morning Dallas
this firstly is a pair of flip-flops and
they are really unusual in that they
have almost like a scarf print in the
for the strap I just think that
absolutely beautiful they look gorgeous
with bikinis also very perfect for
slightly smarter outfits we're going for
lunch things like that very comfortable
and just a real nice upgrade on your
typical pair of flip-flops I've been
wearing those absolutely loads on the
recent trip and then something a little
bit different I tried these on in the
store not really thinking that I would
ever buy them because they're a little
bit out there but then I just absolutely
fell in love with them they are those
pair of sandals with a very low chunky
block heel and you can see I just said
continuing from Tory Burch from the last
job
see what Scott Monica okay continuing
from us retailers
yeah these have got the most beautiful
prints on them it's like a retro 60s
garden style print and then as you can
see the front of them is covered in
pearls they're not the most comfortable
this is quite stiff I wouldn't want to
wear them if I was going to be walking
around a lot but if I just have an event
that I'm going to or if I'm just going
to be going to a garden party or
something where I know I'll be sitting
down a lot then these are absolutely
perfect once again wore them lots on the
recent trips and they're just absolutely
beautiful so totally smitten with both
pairs of shoes me Tory Burch with the
same pattern my next favorite is this
sewing costume again a from Tory Burch
the same orange blush coral colored
floral pattern this is a swimsuit as you
can see you might have spotted it during
my pictures in it the Maldives Islands
certified of me wearing it here I
actually think this looks really cute
with a pair of shorts as well as just as
a bikini by itself I feel a lot more
comfortable in swimsuits as opposed to
bikinis so I like them to be really fun
and statement exactly like this one is
it has got adjustable straps a little
bit of padding which you can take out
and under wiring so it fits the body
really really beautifully the only thing
I wish was that the back was lower when
I do wear swimsuits I'd like to have
quite a low-cut back so that I can get a
little bit more Sun on the skin on my
back but other than that I think this is
absolutely beautiful so a big favorite
and one that I'll be wearing on any
other trips that we have this summer and
beyond I actually have two more
swimsuits to share as part of my
favorites and I feel like when you go on
holiday it's really important to have a
swimsuit that is kind of like your
tanning bikini I say that with inverted
commas I don't really go out and tan I
always have a very high factor SPF on
and I'll never be out there in the like
midday Sun but I don't like to get tan
lines so I have this bikini from Alyssa
Oda bash and this has been the one that
I would reach for when we were just
going to be spending the day or the
afternoon on the beach because there's
nothing worse than wearing an outfit
like this for example and having a nasty
pale ass stripe going down your shoulder
so this was my tanning bikini love the
color I love the style of this the bando
style I have really small boobs
so this is
perfect for me and then the bottoms are
exactly the same they've got a lovely
little bit of gold detail on there this
I think is really flattering I said
previously I don't love bikinis but when
you are spending the day in the sunshine
it is nice to have one so that was my
go-to bikini for our recent trips and
then it's kind of crazy but this month I
have had no less than three swimsuits
with floral details and I feel like they
are all the rage all over Instagram I do
have the most Instagram famous brand
Larrivee and set of photo me wearing the
lavish one here I actually don't love
that one the most I feel like it's very
overpriced and you can get better ones
for a lot cheaper then to the cheapest
end of the scale I also got one from
pretty little thing in fact I'll show
you so this is the lair of a swan the
most expensive it's got the floral
applique over one of the shoulders and
then that goes down to the back half way
down the back doesn't really have any
detail there's no like padding or
structure and yeah very simple but very
very photogenic but for a tenth of the
price I have recently ordered this
haven't worn it yet there is this one
from a retailer called pretty little
thing and it's pretty much identical
this one has got pink flowers and it
scoops all the way down to the back the
flowers go across both arms as you can
see instead of just being one arm like
the Lara Bash one but this was under 20
pounds so absolutely gorgeous however
this is a huge digression because my
favorite floral swimming costume that I
have worn mostly actually in Amalfi is
this one this one is from Caledonia and
it's the first thing that I've ever
tried from the ground this one is by far
the most well-made of the three it's got
a little bit of structure in the boob
area so you feel supported but there's
no wires it's just slightly thicker
almost like neoprene like a sports bra
within some costume so you feel very
much supported and uplifted very very
flattering the floral detail goes across
one shoulder and then all the way around
once again I'll insert a photo me
wearing it here I really love this photo
of me getting splashed this was not
planned it's meant to be a very dry
photos I have my favorite Tory Burch
flip-flops on but yeah just saw that
photo is really fun it's also cut quite
high up the bum and it gives you a
really great fun so that
I am very very grateful for and
price-wise it sits in between the two of
the pretty little thing one and the
narrow - so this out of the three is my
favorite floral sewing costume that I
have been wearing this month next a
couple of accessories and in general I
have been obsessed with straw bags not
groundbreaking I know they were all the
trend last summer and they are very much
on trend again this summer three
favorites to show you I will do them in
no particular order firstly these two
you will not be surprised to see this
one if you follow me on instagram at
josie LTM this one I picked up from Club
Monaco but you can get it in a few
different retailers I'll leave a few
options down below it was quite
expensive but I absolutely love it it's
got a drawstring at the top so if you're
on the beach you don't get sand in there
it's pretty spacious I've got another
dust bag inside it now because when I
pack it in my suitcase it's very
important to put it in a dust bag
otherwise these will get totally ruined
but this is so fun that makes a great
statement and I had so many questions
about it on my Instagram on that note
sorry major digression alert but if you
do follow me on Instagram and you ever
wonder where anything is from or if you
want to shop my outfits on a regular
basis make sure you're following me on
the like to know it out because I share
not only the outfits I'm wearing on
Instagram but also so many wall pictures
that don't even make Instagram with
loads of different outfits even things
like flat leis my favorite beauty
products and it's all shoppable I'll
insert a little screen recording here
basically when you follow me on the app
all my Instagram photos all of my
outfits just click on them and
everything that I'm wearing in them is
linked down below so a really easy way
of shopping my Instagram and any other
bloggers that you follow so if you'd
have followed me on that when you saw
this on my Instagram you'd have known
where it's from and being able to shop
it this next one is also really fun it's
got a couple of little pom-poms less
roomy it's more for kind of evenings and
if you don't need to carry too much
stuff with you but a really really fun
little clutch bag this one is from LK
Bennett again it's got the really rough
ruffle detail which i think is really
effective mostly of all this in Amalfi
and absolutely loved having this as a
finishing touch to my outfits and then
the biggest and probably most practical
of the three is this one a very classic
straw bag from Michael
cause this I used as my hand luggage
what I love about this one excuses stuff
inside is that it does have a lot of
pockets you've got a zip pocket an
envelope pocket to little side pockets
and then on this side you have a huge
selection of pockets which is great if
you want to keep your stuff organized
I have things like memory card readers
vlogging cameras and in my previous
straw bags you just had to chuck
everything in the bottom which is not
very tidy so this one keeps me a lot
more organized and it's really really
beautiful so a few more fashion
favorites I already mentioned my Club
Monaco jumpsuit but I have also apps
even loving wearing this dress is month
this is from marjorelle and it has been
my go-to on beach holidays even when
we're exploring towns in Amalfi it just
works on so many different occasions
it's very very flattering thanks to the
waist belt so this ties around the waist
giving you a really lovely feminine
silhouette it's fairly low-cut and
actually you can see side boob area so
you probably don't want to wear a bra or
you could wear a little lace band
underneath it what I really love is that
it doesn't need ironing so I have just
washed it when I've got home from the
trips stuck it straight into my next
suitcase and you are ready to go and
it's just something that's super easy to
throw on and always looks fabulous so
big big fan of this I might even get
changed and wear this today we're off
for a barbecue at Charlie's mom's house
and I feel like it's just one of those
things that works with every single
dress code puffs and weddings definitely
don't wear this for wedding next and you
must forgive me that this is a little
bit creased it's come straight off the
dryer and it is this beautiful cotton
blouse from French Connection I think
when you go on holiday it's really
important to have a lightweight blouse
like this in your suitcase because if
you are going to be out in the midday
Sun it's really important to protect
your shoulders stop you're getting burn
time you're getting heatstroke really
really good idea to have something like
this it's also very lightweight so
you're not going to get too hot if you
work in a hot country or if you're in a
warm office during these hot days in the
UK it's really nice to have something
lightweight but also fairly smart for
this time of year a plain cotton blouse
is wonderful but this one has a little
bit of extra detail as you can see on
the shoulders here it's got some
embroidery some little beads in this
beautiful floral pattern so it's just a
little bit of extra detail that makes it
even that love
so I got so much use out of this over
the past few weeks and it'll definitely
be coming with me on again any other
summer holidays my final fashion
favorite is this beach dress from River
Island don't know if you guys were
following me this time last year but you
might remember this shirt dress this was
so popular it sold out within days of
going live online and I absolutely loved
it even when I wear it now I get so so
many questions River Island bought this
dress out as the 2018 version to that
dress it's not quite the same it doesn't
fit the body exactly the same but it is
absolutely gorgeous again something like
this is perfect for beach holidays
really easy to throw on over your bikini
and just instantly look fabulous with
perhaps a straw clutch bag and some
sandals instant beach heat chic outfit
this was also more affordable than the
one last year but you've got a lot of
the same details lots of really
beautiful embroidery and then you've got
a little bit of a kind of crochet detail
going down to the bottom in fact I
actually tried to recreate a photo that
I took last year wearing the original
River Island dress here and then I took
the same photo wearing this dress in all
these this year so that was good fun and
yeah a really beautiful very versatile
dress and very affordable from the high
street too so now that you've seen on my
fashion and accessory favorites I'm
going to whiz through a few beauty
favorites this month you guys will not
be surprised to hear that I am including
my Jade roller this is from a brand
called herbivore I've been doing this
every single morning I'm obsessed I
basically roll my skin for about two
minutes it's quite a mindful morning
thing to do it helps with lymphatic
drainage it helps to D puff the face
it's generally just really relaxing if
you keep it in the fridge as well very
very refreshing especially on holidays I
kept in the fridge in the Maldives and
in a Malfi and in Tulum and it was just
my favorite thing to do when I woke up
go outside have my coffee watch the Sun
coming up and just roll my skin
especially when you've got lots of
flights and your skin might be a little
bit puffy then I've just been absolutely
loving doing that usually I would spray
on this which is the herbivore Jasmine
green tea toning mist so I would shake
this up spritz this all over my face it
really helps to balance and calm the
skin it's got aloe vera in there as well
which actually I didn't know into
recently contains salicylic acid so for
any blemishes it's very good at just
calming the skin after spraying my face
with this I would use my Jade roller and
that was just an amazing morning routine
for my trips and something that I've
been continuing to do here in the UK and
then the next thing that I've been using
also from her before is their pink cloud
moisturizer the brand as a whole I am a
huge fan of everything they stand for I
am totally in agreement with a very
natural products they are totally
against animal testing there are no
nasty ingredients in these which is
something I've become increasingly aware
of and I'm trying to switch a lot of my
products to be more natural this is this
contains rose water so it's very very
calming it's very quickly absorbed and
it's just a dreamy consistency an
absolute pleasure to apply it smells
really beautiful and super super
hydrating which is what you want in a
moisturizer so this has been my dream
team morning skincare routine for the
past few weeks something that I have
loved lately is that I have not had to
have worn at mascara for the past four
weeks or so because I had Nouveau lashes
SBS lash treatment and that means speed
volume style it took about an hour and a
half to get individual lash extensions
applied and oh my goodness I could not
recommend it any more if you have got
any holidays coming up this summer or if
you just don't like to wear too much
makeup when it gets warm then honestly
it's the best thing to do so worth it I
love getting out of bed and not having
to worry about putting on any makeup
especially on beachy days so what I did
before a trip started I had the lash
treatment and I also dyed my own
eyebrows using an eye yo kit and I just
felt so comfortable without makeup on
not having to worry about getting a
waterproof mascara from being in the sea
getting super hot the treatment itself
was so quick and the lashes lasted such
a long time in fact today is actually
the first day that i have worn mascara
in about a month because stupidly
I used a face mist yesterday when it was
super super hot outside and I think the
face mist must have contained oil and
oil is the one ingredient that you
absolutely have to avoid if you have if
you have individual lash extensions
because it breaks the bond between the
lashes
your lashes so if you have my lashes
fell out yesterday after so long of none
of them falling out if I'll definitely
be booking myself in for some refills it
was this time last year that I first
started with the individual lashes and
throughout the whole of summer last year
I just kept going in for top ups getting
them topped up and I will do exactly the
same this year because it's so nice just
to not have to worry about mascara
throughout the whole of summer so my
individual lash extensions from Nouveau
lashes is definitely a huge favorite of
the last few weeks and my final beauty
related favorite is this this is the
almond delightful body balm from
L'Occitane this is just such a luxurious
thing to use I'm almost out of this I'm
going to apply it all over my body now
it's totally dreamy to apply the smell
if you love the smell of almonds if you
love marzipan is just mouth-watering is
literally making my mouth water now the
consistency is so balmy so cream it's
absolutely gorgeous to apply and it is
so hydrating I always find almond oil to
be really good for my skin and when you
go on holiday and then you go on a
long-haul flight you can be a little bit
scaly by the end of it but I absolutely
covered my body in this before and after
the flights and my skin has survived
like the super dehydrating conditions of
an airplane so huge fan of this not too
big either this is a hundred mils so if
you are doing a hand luggage trip then
this will be allowed my final favorite
is a pair of sunglasses I have worn
quite a lot of pairs of sunglasses over
the past few weeks on our various trips
but the one that I keep going back to
and that is my absolute favorite is this
pet from Chloe I feel like again if you
follow me on instagram you'll not be
surprised these are from well duty-free
well duty-free is the best place to buy
sunglasses because they have a huge
selection and you don't have to pay the
taxes on them because it is in an
airport and I feel like when you're
going through the airport you are in the
holiday mode so it is the perfect time
to try on sunglasses so these I cannot
remember the exact name of them but
they're a very iconic Chloe sunglasses
design
I have loved wearing them they are
obviously very statement but still I
find them so wearable they instantly
make your outfit look so cool so retro I
received a lot of compliments wearing
these and I also just love how they look
in photos as well so big fan of those
and those are my final favorite of April
so that's all from me darlings I hope

favorites let me know what you guys have
