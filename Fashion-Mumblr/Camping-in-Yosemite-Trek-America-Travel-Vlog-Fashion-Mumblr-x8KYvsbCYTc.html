from a campsite which I cannot remember
the name of but I will ride it down here
we spent the night in our tents again
last night not quite as luxurious
campsite as yesterday I have not
travelled for three days now but still
looking fresh thanks to baby wipes and
dry shampoo and so this morning we have
left the campsite bright and early it's
probably at half-past eight now and we
are going for a trek or going for our
first trek of a trip I think this one's
going to be just like a couple of hours
along a river path nearby so it should
be nice and fun I am rocking the trek
America bandanna to try and hide my my
bad hair day and I'm just so grateful
that I bought this jumper I didn't think
I'd wear it that much but actually a
little bit chillier than I was expecting
and so yeah I've been wearing this
jumper all the time says I'm in it's
from a unique campaign ages ago I've got
something in the post so it's coming
really useful and also my sweaty Betty
leggings which I think I'm going to be
living in for the rest of the trip so
comfy and I didn't bring any other
practical trousers anyway um I think the
gang is ready let's go trekking
we are on the road again heading it
towards Yosemite I think we've got about
four hour drive ahead of us we just
stopped off at a supermarket now have
Donuts you got 12 Donuts for five
dollars which I thought was amazing
okay everybody spit on a bit of a
sweetie Hall when do you get Helen Hall
all right hang on okay you're ready
place Americans we hold hold
oh god I got now oh my god all right
these are like lemon flavored cream
actually really good I got watermelon
salad that Oh pizzas beef jerky and
there were some mini Chips Ahoy
yeah and I got a answer back corner
boiling all right now I've had the help
a bit yeah nice work so we've got our
snacks and just waiting for the gangers
the people to arrive and then on the
road do you like donuts
mmm just sat down for lunch now we're
about a quarter of the way to Yosemite I
think there's still quite a long way to
go
picked up a blue slush puppy because
I've felt the need for a few more
numbers and they were having just a
usual set up for lunch we've got a few
bits and bobs which you pitch with a
supermarket and I'm going crisps Lee
Adama cheese carrots beans who must
and price we are back on the road again
and I have let's see in the house
sitting up front next to town is
speeding us towards Yosemite what's our
eta about three or four hours basic
about Valley in California you got the
San Luis Obispo reservoir right there is
risk for Louise go out
that's the reservoir that's huge check
it oh man man Wow
that's not the ocean that's a reservoir
sitting up front design with its
responsibilities in charge of the
playlist and yeah I gotta be DJ I've
gotta be the time yeah it's quite a
bunch of actually to get church from the
music but
we have just arrived at the campsite in
Yosemite after the most beautiful drive
the drive is about six hours I think
from Big Sur so it's a long way we've
all had one too many sweets or about
twenty too many sweets on the bus all
very very hyper but now it's time to set
up the tents it's our third time sitting
at the tents so I feel like you're
becoming froze at this
pennies are all set up now and we're
just getting ready for dinner
Gregg is currently stoking the fire here
good job
and as he is from specific ax he's taken
over dinner duties for tonight and we're
having a bride salad arbic you and the
sous chefs are busy at work we're having
tonight got some learning to chicken
sweet on what I was gonna do so nice
good morning it is our first and
possibly only are we doing 70 tomorrow
no no it is our first and only day in
Yosemite today and we drove up here
yesterday I think I showed you guys us
setting up the campsite and it's really
nice campsite we are all together and in
words lovely and today we left the
campsite bright and early it's about
half past eight at the moment and we are
doing our first track of the day and we
are on a two mile track which should
take us around an hour and we're going
to find some giant sequoia trees which
other ones are the really really fat
tree stumps and we just saw one that was
chopped down but that one had been
around since like the year 70 so yeah
really really old tree
I didn't actually know that much about
your 70 before coming here but it's
basically an absolutely gianormous
National Park here in America in
California I think it's it's so big it's
almost like the size of England it's
like ridiculously big and it's quite
well known for the trees they are some
of the biggest trees in America if not
the world again and there's lots of
bears everywhere so oh we are on yes we
don't know they existed we've only seen
a few who bear like tree stumps at the
moment this is just biggest tree I think
I've ever seen in my life look at some
normal-sized tree and that's the square
anyway it's the mate
Darrin's just been giving us some fun
facts about a Sequoia trees so they are
the largest living things in the entire
world bigger than any animal biggest
trees of all the trees so they are the
largest living things in the world which
is really amazing to think about that
when you think about all the sea mammals
bigger than a whale bigger than Earth
yeah bigger than everything and also he
said that for every inch that you see
above the ground so these ginormous
trees there is an equal size underground
as well so if you think that we're only
seeing half of this tree it's really
incredible
very very funny
so we're now in Yosemite Valley next
thing we're doing this morning is taking
the mist trail to the vernal and Nevada
Falls is it's about a six mile
round-trip so it's going to take us a
good few hours I'm going to see a couple
of reboot --all waterfalls on the way
we're just waiting for the shuttle bus
now to take us to the start of the trail
Darrin our littler tour leader I said
we're not allowed to do any technology
and no filming while we're going up
there so I'm going to log off now and
next time I towards the camera we'll be
at the top film on the way there but I
mean on the way up we're just gonna
enjoy this hike like normal people for a
few hours no no people yeah I don't know
what that means
see you in a few hours
you
we go to the top of the sierra nevada
water pool we have been tracking for
about two hours there's actually a
really really tough track people
a mess for me
because it is absolutely
but I cook in the spirit
laughs
so we've decided to track even playa
so another bootiful I can't even imagine
how much higher we can go
my legs are covered
I think we're nearly at the top I've
been hoping that the views
then
so we're on our way back down again that
water food I just showed you the clip
off we basically just walk
the spray of that on a treacherous down
rocky slope hence why both Maddie and I
are absolutely so gay so we're just
waiting for the rest of the gang at this
little
slightly more sheltered spots and there
got about another
our I think and
be rewarded with ice-cream and Wi-Fi
yeah so Helen's been to the gift shop
and she's gonna give us a little ghost
Amenti gift shop pull comes to this
wonderful paper bag now I'm gonna start
with the smaller items I'm going to
finish the larger because I have like
family and they'll win title by the main
thing I bought myself some subsidy we
have some fridge magnets Laurie are
these wonderful Yosemite fridge magnets
which offline
this is Boojum oh my god so small sized
man I really like that yeah how much was
that 24 I might get one of those like my
Mecca cells or xxx err I do for ya
I got smaller size you got that
just get up to a gas station and there's
literally in the woods bad
a little one
oh he's literally looking at us
I hope you doesn't feel threatened
Wow
don't forget to look with your eyes and
not just for your camera because this is
 love it's got a trickle on him
look he's got a tracker
after a very exciting an exhausting day
we're back at the campsite and tonight
it's mine and Maddie's turn it to make
dinner so there's been a bit of a rotor
you cook dinner or you clean the van or
you have a night off or you do the
dishes and it's on final night camping
and Maddie and I are cooking I happen to
mention to the group earlier in the week
that I cook a killer
mac and cheese so that's what's on the
menu tonight
not going to like feeling the pressure a
little bit I've never cooked a mac and
cheese for 12 people before but you know
I'm pretty confident in my mac and
cheese making abilities and also doing
it with American ingredients that I'm
not too familiar with but hey ho let's
get cooking
spreading the bed
you
