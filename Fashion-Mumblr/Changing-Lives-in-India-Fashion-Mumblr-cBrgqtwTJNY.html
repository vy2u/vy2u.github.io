here in India and we have just arrived
to the most incredible welcome yet at
petit export and I'm going to find out a
lot more about Teddy now but basically
petit was the very first community trade
company the body shop to work with they
started by purchasing a little wooden
footsie roller and that started off
their trade not aid programs but really
incredible speed here we're going to
find out not about what they're making
and the lovely guys and girls that work
here hello so let's go inside and this
month month
sorry I got a Harley distracted by
coconut water but so yeah this place
that we are now is the Teddy excellent
site and one of the employees from the
Oxford store I believe at the body shop
her name was Amanda she actually came
out here on a volunteering mission in
the 1980s and she wanted to build a
school she wanted to help the community
and so she asked the body shop if they
would Susan trading with one of the
farms out here and what they're
originally making or what they started
creating for the body shop Woody's
wooden foot massagers which the Causby
foot see rollers and that started off
the trade not aid program which the boy
shops now well that's pretty much what
their business is all about so it's all
about supporting the local community and
not just handing out charity so really a
long-term benefits the community so what
we're going to do now is go upstairs Lee
who works here and it's going to explain
what's going on what they're doing to
look at community at the moment what
they're creating and more about the
backstory so yeah pretty overwhelming to
be here when we're going to go inside
and find out what
you
every
is increasing medical - I'm not helping
embarrass you doing it see if you can
left surprise yeah
so we're in the screen crazy room now
this is where they make the prints which
go on the body cell type and another to
go to another text
pretty incredible seeing in the very
early stages of the bicep you carry
around some day every day as a lot of
the work itself of their women until the
team is very very happy we concern about
how courteous is such a familiar face
more like a family and he was explaining
that the work is not only the women get
them which that to be important because
dance when women go home often making
themselves last if we said their
husbands and their children and as women
so hungry so amazing that they provide
all their staff and even children here
in the local school
lunch it's really important to Kodiak to
really treat the workers like family and
we can you get that vibe here not only
the workers here all have health care
petty vitamins with health camps and not
only is that the workers also their
families and another community so the
Rings other good things they're doing is
really really wide appeal for people oh
sorry
okay use what items like I cannot hear
any tips I've got mine ever since we now
come to the part of the factory work
area where they make the wooden so
behind me they are assembling 40 rollers
which is what this feels like
modular few more days
nicely go again or the things very very
happy we're going to go into uses
everybody up now
we are heading back on service now after
a school of the whole penny exports area
the textile area and the wooden massage
roller area so it's a really fascinating
morning I think the thing that struck me
the most from both presentations and
being shown around is health companies
like the body shop working with the
teddy exports program is more about
really planning building useful back
into a community is all about teaching
them skills and getting these people
actually working and not just handing
out money to charity which I think
Charlie got a photo of the expression
give the man a fish and he has a meal
for a day teach a man to fish and he and
get the meal for life but pretty much
thumbs up I don't think we'll ever look
at our tote bags in the massage rollers
all day away you appreciate I think it
will make us appreciate my item ease of
use you know sometimes the stick of a
lot or thank you yeah appreciate there's
a lot more when you see how much work it
was like everything all the good things
good morning everybody its day two here
in Madurai annoyingly I left my vlog
camera battery charging in hotel rooms
though logging on the phone suppose
using the quality is a little bit
rubbish today that we start the day back
at penny exports we've come to more of
the farmland area behind me this
building here is a little cow John hunt
and this is where Amanda Murphy so she
you remember I told you yesterday or
earlier in the vlog that she was the
body shop employee that came out in
beyond volunteering work and she
actually ended up marrying the guy who
owns a lot of this farmland and
we're petty exports really started what
they do now more in recent years
probably that was like twenty thirty
years ago this behind me here is one of
their latest projects and what they do
is they exceeded a few of the tell you
export employees into local communities
into local villages to really pinpoint
any problem areas and any things that's
going on that that shouldn't be going on
and what they found was a lot of
families were sending their children out
their wives out the sex workers and
obviously jealous or not what should be
happening what they did here is they
actually bring a lot of these women in
and they petty exports and some charity
partners provide six months training for
these women to the Kadem schooling
learning to be skills and trade learn
how to be tailors and of course they're
paying them to learn but also when they
finish the course they can either get a
job tailoring actually export or they
can create jobs themselves and local
communities so three fantastic issues
for those we just met officer
communities and heard a lot of stories
which as you can imagine was pretty
emotional and totally somewhat of false
proof no one should have to go through
but it's amazing that they're practicing
with the opportunity so there's
definitely some incredible work being
done here this is no commercial benefit
at the body shop it's just part of the
community trade program that they're
stepping up here so it's been a real
amazing opportunity to get see this and
get to meet the lovely ladies they've
given us our flowers and our welcoming
marks so I think now we're heading it to
school and we're going to meet some
local children the school that Teddy
exports step up and fund so let's go
meet the children
baby
me
baby
tell me
thank you
so as you just saw we just went through
the primary school and we're treated to
an incredible dance performance from a
lot of the pupils which was really
spectacular until they've been working
very hard for weeks practicing that for
us and then we went to the school for
the special needs children so what they
also spent a lot of effort on here is
making sure they're catering to all the
children a lot of the societies around
here they don't fully accept children
that have difficulties met often this
left at home or not really very well
cared for but here they've read spent a
lot of effort in educating them and
helping to also educate the community on
how these children can be looked after
and providing them with an education to
come all the purpose which is really
incredible so it certainly it was a
pretty emotional meeting all those
lovely children but I can tell that
they're in a really really good place so
that was a pretty overwhelming then
we've had lunch at the canteen where the
staff have their lunch every day and I
think now we're heading to the secondary
school so
so it has been treated to a tool of the
secondary school here at Peggy and all
the children had sets out different
stages in their classroom and they were
showing us
geography puzzles and math puzzles and
such say that they are getting and very
encouraged education here is now leaving
time at the school and they are all very
excited to go home have a look a bit we
just found like to a local village which
is about ten minutes away from the telly
export site and we're here to have a
little look around
basically see where these guys come from
and what their living conditions are
like there so expecting to be even more
emotionally drained than we already are
but yes so let's go home and look around
meet some of the guys that live here and
yes laughing we're going to have a
little look around early yeah guys live
here
you
and I
you're popular darling I see you feel
quite okay yeah that's not so much a
drama we introduce them to the magical
world of snapchat building I'm gone
Morrissey Bob Marley we really wanted to
mention about Marlo you know such a
corny like that but again they're happy
you're happy
so it is our final day here in Madurai
today Charlie and I are heading off to
the airport soon but I thought I could
catch up with you guys before before I
finished the vlog so last night we had
our leaving party or our farewell dinner
at the teddy export site and we were
treated to an amazing celebration
displayed from some local guys and girls
who were playing drums they were doing
these incredible tricks some of them I
couldn't even look they were throwing
ringing the fire they were opening
bottles with their eyelids it was just
insane like totally incredible and then
we had a fantastic dinner all the food
here has been absolutely amazing I've
definitely put on a few pounds that's
for sure lots of naan breads lots of
rice and lots of very tasty curries but
we have been so well looked after here
everyone is so friendly
and we've had the most incredible time
it's been a very eye-opening experience
of course it's just so amazing to see
what the body shop is doing out here the
impact that they are creating on so many
lives is absolutely amazing and to hear
about their future plans for community
trade as well is really really
incredible I'm going to be writing a few
blog posts about what I've learned here
so those are the published so far and
leave links down below so definitely
please go and check them out because
there is so much that I just can't show
you on a video there's so much that I
can't even put down in words it's just
it's been so surreal being here and yeah
definitely an unforgettable experience
but I'm definitely leaving this trip
feeling so positive about what the body
shop is doing and what Teddy exports in
particular are doing and I definitely
want to find out more ways I can help
because even more or what we would think
of as small amounts of money make such a
huge impact here so for example
yesterday I told you that we met a group
of six ladies that used to be working as
sex workers and the teddy exports the
community trade system that the body
shop put on not only goes towards the
factories and the places that are making
products but also helping the wider
community so this particular project it
brings people from the local community
that are really struggling so these
ladies were the sex workers and in order
to help tempt them away from that line
of work they provide them with paid
education to train them up to be skilled
tailors and they provide this payment
this paid training for six months and it
costs only two and a half thousand
pounds to train and educate and pay and
feed these women for six months that is
mind-blowing and to give you an idea of
the skill of the tailors at Teddy
exports I'm going to show you my
trousers apologies I'm so shiny but it's
about 40 degrees in this room and so
yeah these houses when we were looking
through the markets on the first day I
showed you some clips of Charlie and I
looking through some silks I spent I
think I spent about 300 rupees which is
about three pounds on a big load of silk
I think it was maybe like four meters of
silk and then I took them to Teddy
exports next day and the tailors really
quickly measured me and look at what
they made so I'm wearing them right now
because I love them so much so these are
my teddy export silk trousers they've
even got beautiful pockets obviously the
silk I chose it's fairly sheer so I
should have gotten four one fi'ty
thicker they put button in a reinforced
waistband
got the pocket they fit me out to you
perfectly and then they come down to
this cropped length so perfect for a
last day in India outfit so yeah the
people working at Teddy are incredibly
incredibly skilled and highlight to the
trip also going around the village
yesterday all the children were so happy
to see us
it's amazing that even though these the
people that live here they don't have a
lot they're just so happy and I think a
lot of that is thanks to teddy exports
what they're doing they're really
helping to improve the community in so
many ways and yeah I really hope this
videos helped to portray that it's so
hard trying to get it across in a
YouTube video on a tiered system
something that you really do have to
experience for yourself but hopefully
this is giving you a little bit of a
glimpse and yeah it's been great sharing
it with you guys but
and keep an eye on my blog I will be
sharing lots more update lots of photos
on there as well hopefully you guys put
my Instagram story too because I have so
much on there so yeah we're going to go
and do a little bit of work in reception
now where we've got Wi-Fi and then we're
catching our next flight on your log off
here thank you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you in my next vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
