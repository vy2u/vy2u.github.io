clean that river is it's so clean you
can actually drink the water from the
rivers here in fact we have been
drinking it well yeah yeah and now we
are heading back actually we went
yesterday we went to see I think it's
called the Bahnhofstrasse ER which is
the train station that has the Christmas
markets in and there was quite a big
shopping street down near there so we're
gonna have a little wander down mass
have a look in a few shops there were
some shops with some nice Bob Lee hats
and earmuffs that would mind going into
and then we got to check out at 12
o'clock so we head back to hotel maybe
get some brunch and then on to the
airport
we have just got home after what was
probably the world's quickest journey I
think we landed about an hour ago if
that into London City Airport and then
we hopped straight on the DLR and back
home so I think we were in Switzerland
like two hours ago which is rather crazy
and yeah we've got about 10 15 minutes
turnaround time before we need to head
out again because we have got a blogger
youtuber party this evening and then my
