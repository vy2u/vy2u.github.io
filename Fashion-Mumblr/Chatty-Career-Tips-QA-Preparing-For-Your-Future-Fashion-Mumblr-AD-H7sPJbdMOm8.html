joining me for today's video I hope
you're all really really well in case
you couldn't tell by the cozy jumper and
the cup of camomile tea in front of me
today's video is going to be a really
chilled out chatty heart-to-heart type
of video and today I wanted to talk all
about our futures and the things we can
do now that will impact our futures and
that's everything from career choices a
level university choices internships to
preparing financially for the future so
I thought I would do this for you
because I did get quite a few of those
type of questions when I did my Q&amp;amp;A
recently so I thought I would dedicate
an entire video to it so this video is
in collaboration with Aviva who want us
to start thinking about the future that
we want now because after all now is the
time we're building our future it's
little changes that we can make now that
really will impact the way that we live
in a few years time whether that's 5 10
20 or 30 even more even further into the
future things that we can do now can
really affect how we live in the future
and our quality of life
so they've launched an online tool could
shape my future which you can use to
give you an idea on how your life may
look based on things like how much you
scroll away each month towards your
retirement plans whether you're a
homeowner all those kind of things or
you can flip it the other way around so
you can say okay I want to live in a
four bedroom home with the latest
smartphone etc and it will give you a
little idea as to how much you need to
be popping by for your future so a
really really useful tool very
light-hearted just gives you an idea on
how you can start preparing for your
future today
so I touched a little bit on my past
career and experiences in my Q&amp;amp;A video
but I wanted to go a little bit more in
detail about that in today's video as
well as sharing a few tips that I picked
up along the way that I hopefully will
have
you to get to be where you want to be in
the short term or in the long term
future as well so just in case you don't
know I'll give a very brief overview I'm
now a full-time blogger and youtuber I'm
very lucky to say that I'm doing my
dream job now and it is my full-time job
it's my passion and my full-time job
before that I used to work as a software
company I was marketing manager for a
software company who sold their software
to retailers so still within the fashion
industry but more on the technology side
of it before that I was more in the
fashion industry
I was marketing assistant at Mulberry
the luxury leather handbag company and I
also interned there for over a year and
I interned out while I was studying so I
studied at London College of Fashion
graduated with a BA Honours in fashion
management of first class honours and
before that I did a levels of English
economics textiles Spanish and
photography so that's a little brief
overview of my past to give you an idea
of where I'm coming from
when thinking about your future I would
say my first tip whether you're in
school university or in a job would be
to not ignore your passions I'm such a
true believer in doing what you love and
don't ever think that your passion can't
turn into a career I think if you love
something enough you will enjoy doing
what you're doing and you'll want to
work hard at it which can potentially
lead to a careers so my personal
experience I never thought that blogging
would ever be able to lead to a career
even two or three years ago yes there
were people doing blocking full-time but
they were few and far between and it was
a hobby that I absolutely loved because
I was so passionate about it I put a lot
of time into it but never did I think
you'd be able to be my full-time job but
just by working hard at it and
continually putting in the effort
eventually I was able to turn it into my
full-time career so your passion could
be photography it could be styling it
could be completely unrelated to the
fashion industry there are just examples
that I know of because that's what fills
my head but don't ever think that your
passion can't become your career you can
pave the way you can create a career I
think if you work hard and there
are some financial gains to what you're
doing then pave the way and you can make
a career out of your passion I think for
me it always hoped that I was a little
bit entrepreneurial at school and the
young age I never really thought about
the financial implications but more
about the lifestyle that I wanted when I
was older I knew I wanted to go to
afford nice things live in a nice house
go on nice holidays and so I always
worked hard because of this because of
these aspirations so whether that was
charging 20p to read people's fortunes
in the school playground or making my
own jewelry just at home in front of the
TV making little play charms I was
always doing something that would
prepare for my future if that makes
sense I was always wanting to add a
little bit more pocket money do
something productive or learn a new
skill and I think that leads on quite
nicely to my second tip which would be
to surround yourself with positive and
supportive people because if you've got
people around you that are telling you
you can do things and they're willing to
help you out in any way they can whether
that's just offering an ear when you've
got a problem that you just need to
spurt out or whether it's offering you
physical help I always used to enlist my
brother or my boyfriend and into
softening the clay when I was trying to
make the jewelry it's so important to
just have a network of people around you
they're supportive and they're positive
so next I want to talk about how to plan
for your future and a quote that's
always stuck with me some words of
wisdom that someone once told me be the
person you want to be in your mind
before you become that person and I live
by that so many times and I think it's
so true I remember when I first started
my blog I probably only had about 500
readers for every single blog post it
was definitely not the biggest blog in
the world not where it is today
not that it's Vegas bobbies in Rome
today but I just went ahead and I
printed all these really fancy business
cards with fashion mumbler Josephina
editor and creator and I would go around
at these events I'm really confident
with myself very confident with my blog
handing out these business cards
introducing myself as editor of fashion
mumbler and just by having that
confidence people
stood up and they took me seriously they
wanted to know about this blog they
wanted to work with fashion manga so I
would say that by being positive and
confident and creating this successful
business around you people will believe
it people will want to work with you so
I guess what I'm trying to say is you
really have to believe in yourself
before anyone else can believe in you
cheesy and you've probably found it
before but when you think about it so so
true something that I've always done as
well is thinking quite logistical II
about my future
so things that I always wanted of course
was financial independence and living
this nice lifestyle I didn't really need
to worry about money too much and I
think looking back I've actually done
small things over the years that have
helped to build that future the major
thing of course is all around me the
house that I live in this house is my
financial security it is by far the
biggest investment I've ever made and it
was not an easy investment I can
definitely tell you that it's still not
an easy investment living in London is
not cheap it gives me the financial
security and the peace of mind knowing
I've got a roof over my head and that
financial security for my future and by
not going out partying every night or
every Friday Saturday and Sunday I can
save a lot of money the money that I
would spend by partying I've put back
into the house continually investing in
my future thinking about long term
benefits as opposed to short term good
times or good nights out moving it even
further forward I think it's really
important that even at such a young age
even if you're in your teens or in your
20s it's so important to think further
ahead even about what life is going to
be like when you retire because suddenly
your income potentially it's just gonna
stop like you're not gonna have an
employer giving you a regular wage or as
someone that self-employed I may not be
able to physically work as long as I do
so this is something that I really
started to think about recently so it's
for that very reason that Aviva asked me
to check out their shape my future tool
and they want us to start thinking now
about the changes that
can make all the things that we can be
doing to ensure that we are where we
want to be financially in 10 20 30 or 40
years so it's a really light-hearted
tool on their website I'll leave a
little link down below where you can
fill in how much money you're putting
aside each week or each month how much
money your employer is putting aside
each month for you and also things like
with you're a homeowner how much income
you're going to be getting from things
like rent and then it gives you an idea
the kind of lifestyle you could expect
lead based on those figures when you
retire or what you can do it the other
way around
so I said to it I really want to be
living in a nice full bedroom home I
want to have the latest satellite TV
latest smartphone I want to be able to
afford insurance for my family home
insurance and it told me the figure that
I need to start to think about
squirreling away each month in order to
make that a reality it's quite shocking
actually I haven't really realized that
I need to be putting your wedding quite
so much there definitely a good way to
get you thinking about what you can be
doing now to prepare for your future so
I really hope this little chat has got
you guys thinking about how you can
potentially start to be preparing for
your future now I know that by using the
shape my future tool on the Aviva site
it's definitely got that ball in motion
in my head so I hope you guys will check
it out it really is just a very quick
and easy tool I'll leave the links and
the content hub down below and there's
some videos on it as well all links down
below and also on that topic I thought I
would open up the floor eyes over and do
a little QA based around careers and
futures because as I mentioned that is
something that you are really interested
in in my last Q&amp;amp;A video so I'm going to
check my Twitter and see what you guys
have been asking okay so rachel has said
JC how'd you not become a blogger what
would you be doing now and when did you
decide that blogging was the thing for
you
love you with little blue heart cute
thank you Rachel
okay so had I not been blogging in the
short-term I would probably still be a
software company it was only
a bit ago that I left there so I'm sure
I'd probably still be there working as
marketing manager the company I keep
tabs on them and they're growing they're
doing really well so I think I probably
still be there I would also be keeping
my eye on the fashion industry and the
digital industry I was always really
interested in both so I would definitely
be working in that field but in the long
term I think even if blogging hadn't
been the route that I'd gone down I'm
sure one way or another I've ended up
working for myself because I honestly
think some people are not designed for
an office job some people just are the
kind of person that is happy to do their
own thing and some people are just
designed to be self-employed and have
their own businesses and I think I'm not
going to person's I'm sure after a few
years within the office work 9 to 6
industry I probably would have ended up
doing my own thing one way or another
Alisha has asked do you have any tips on
getting a summer internship yes ok well
my first tip would be to really refine
your CV one of the best quotes that my
uni lecturer Sally gave me she said that
if she can fit her career her 40 year
really super experienced career on one
page of a4 then you can too especially
as students will although that is for
patronym CVS I our words in a chip shop
I worked as a waitress I would say
firstly refine your CV because when
looking for an internship people just
have a few seconds they just pan the
page and they decide yes or no
straightaway so get your CV looking good
a little bit of personality you make it
a bit different but stick to one a full
page not front and back just one page
that would be my first tip my second tip
would be if you can to try and meet
these people face-to-face because people
that work in especially in the fashion
industry or in demand roles they get
bombarded by a lot of emails and I think
if you can do anything to create
personal contact then that's going to
help you a lot so personally I went to
the vogue fashion night out and I made a
beeline for the marketing person at
mulberry introduce myself and that's how
the conversation got started if you have
any
people coming in to give speeches at
university perhaps you want in tune with
them to put your hand up or go and
introduce yourself at the end I would
say personal contact is the best way
forward in so many industries it really
is who you know so many my friends are
now working beauty or fashion PR they
don't even list internships on websites
they simply ask that friends like oh
they got a brother or sister have you
got any friends or brothers and sisters
that would want an internship so I would
say spread the message around amongst
friends and family that an internship is
what you're looking for and just see
what experience you can get from the
people that you know amy has asked what
internships did you do and what advice
would you give to someone who's wanting
to get into marketing PS love your
content Thank You Ellie so what
internship did I do I did as I mentioned
a few times a year long at Mulberry
before that I worked I kind of did a
consultancy for John Lowe it's not
really an internship but it wasn't paid
so I guess it kind of was that was a
digital consultancy we basically did a
lot of mystery shopping around a few
John Lewis stores and then helped them
get some ideas on how they could improve
that industry experience that was like a
six month project I also interned at
office shoes I interned at some smaller
like design companies I can't remember
the name of them that they provided
designs to gap or next months and
Spencers but my main tips when it comes
to interning firstly to not get ahead of
yourself you have to remember that you
are sadly at the bottom of the pile you
do have to do things like making the tea
doing photocopying
filling the goodie bags and doing all
those boring jobs but that is what
you're there for you're there to help
out and by having a really positive say
yes attitude that's what the employers
are looking for and it's by having that
positive attitude that's what going
that's what's going to make them ask for
you back in my personal experience by
having this really can-do attitude is
the best thing that you can possibly do
while interning arriving early leaving
late you really do have to just show
willing when you are in those early
career stages and it will pay off I
promise you so guys I feel like I need
to wrap it up now
because when I do these chatty videos I
chat for quite some time it's probably a
half hour long video right now let's see
how good my editing skills are so thanks
so much for watching I hope this has
answered a few of your questions and
giving you a little bit of food for
thought as well thanks so much to Aviva
for letting me know about the shape my
future tool I definitely think you guys
are just give it a go leave a link down
below it's really interesting and if
anything if it helps you start preparing
for your future now then it's it's
whatever go because I know that it
definitely made a few light bulbs switch
on in my head that is for short or so
check that out all information down
below as always thank you guys so much
