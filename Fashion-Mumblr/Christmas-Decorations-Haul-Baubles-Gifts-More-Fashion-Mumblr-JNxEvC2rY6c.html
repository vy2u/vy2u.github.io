joining me for today's video which is
going to be a really fun and festive one
I'm sitting at a bit of a different
angle to usual because the low winter
Sun is just hitting me all kinds of
funny angles including here right now so
I've had to shift positions a little bit
I feel very close to the fireplace I may
turn into a roast chicken by the end of
this video because the fire is currently
on so if I start to get a little bit hot
and bothered you know why so today's
video is going to be a Christmas
decoration haul video because Charlie
and I have been purchasing a few pieces
recently to decorate the house for
Christmas it is Sunday today that I'm
filming this hopefully the same day that
you guys are going to see this video and
over the next few days we're going to
really start decorating the house for
Christmas we haven't had chance to get
our tree yet but we have definitely got
a few things which we can decorate it
with as soon as we do get it so the
retailers that I have been purchasing
from recently include John Lewis
anthropology next and then there's also
a few bits and bobs which I've picked up
on my recent troubles as always with all
my videos everything that I mentioned
where possible will be linked down below
so if you fall in love with any of these
pieces you know where to go to find the
links to buy them first of all the
pieces that I collected on my recent
travels Charlie and I always like to
pick up a Christmas decoration which
even if it doesn't resemble the place
that we visited it will always just
remind us of our little trip away so
when I went to Barbados even though
Charlie wasn't with me I still wanted to
pick up something to remember the trip
by this is just absolutely beautiful
it's a little angel which has been made
out of a shell and then on the other
side it says Barbados in gold so really
lovely reminder of the trip it's even
got these little shells for its wings so
a really lovely kind of organic
decoration if you will and then it's got
these beautiful pearls some lace I just
thought that was so delicate and so
precious and I'm definitely going to be
putting this on our tree for years and
years to come
Charlie and I don't really go for a beam
Fran tree we just prefer it to be a
little bit more personal so we don't say
only red and gold or only white and
silver we just
on things that we love so that will go
absolutely perfectly this next one is a
little bit more plain we pick this up
from Switzerland and considering we went
around so many Christmas markets I was
fairly disappointed with the selection
of Christmas decorations this one I just
picked up from a shop because I thought
it was really pretty it's a plain round
bauble with Rose Goldy white flecks
inside it really really simple nothing
special and it's rehearsed in a few
years I'll probably forget that it was
from Switzerland but for now this is
just a little reminder of our trip and
considering this is the whole video this
one is kind of cheating because actually
this one was a gift from Charlie for my
birthday it is a sausage dog free
decoration that says Dexter in it I just
absolutely love this you can buy me
anything sausage dog related and I will
be happy so yeah as you love this one
and hopefully we will build up even more
of a collection of sausage dog related
to reach arms because and now the things
which are actually available in the UK
things that I've bought since coming
back from our trips and the first
retailer whose bits and bobs I'm going
to go through is anthropology especially
browsing blog lovin and came across
someone's roundup of best Christmas
decorations and there was so many from
anthropology so that kind of inspired
this haul I've not undone a lot of them
since they arrived so I will do like a
first impressions with you guys also a
lot of these pieces I picked up on Cyber
Monday so I did get 20% off because
anthropology is not the cheapest place
to buy Christmas decorations but they do
last year after year so I thought I
would splurge just a little bit this
year this is a set of small baubles in
really beautiful colors you've got some
really warm oranges and reds and gold's
sparkly ones some pink ones and I just
love the colors I thought the selection
of shades here is really beautiful and I
find small ones really good for filling
in the gaps in Christmas trees sometimes
you just don't want a big bowl filling a
gap so these will be good fillers and
also if we get which hopefully we are
doing made to stay when mum comes some
sparkly branches for the fireplace or a
mini Christmas tree these are great for
that I can't remember the prices off the
top of my
but as I mentioned links to everything
will be down below I also love how
anthropology wrap everything it's all
very beautifully wrapped which I guess
you expect from them because you are
paying that slightly higher price point
this one in here very securely wrapped
is a bauble and this is so cute
so I'm not really a big drinker in North
Charleston get it out of plastic to show
you guys to properly so it says pop fizz
clink and it is a little pink champagne
bottle pink and sparkly as I said I just
love personal and just interesting
charms all over the tree things you can
collect year after year and it'll remind
you of that certain Christmas so this is
the first proper tree decoration they
picked up from Anthropologie okay so not
everything is actually Christmas
decoration a lot of these things are
just sausage dog related so these I was
pleasantly surprised by how cheap they
were well cheap they were twelve pounds
I think so after the discount I think I
paid around the ten pound mark and yeah
twelve pounds so these are oven gloves
with sausage dogs on them so be honest
charleen I usually steer away from
getting white almond gloves because they
do get quite stained but I thought
because these are so gorgeous with the
sausage dogs on I could not resist them
if you guys know anyone with a sausage
dog these would probably make a really
good Christmas gift as well because a
useful they're quite chic looking
because they're just black and white
outline of the dog and yeah twelve
pounds I was pretty impressed with those
so that's part of my anthropology haul
ok these next two are definitely a bit
of an impulse purchase and to be honest
I'm probably only going to keep one of
them but I also need to test these on
the tree because they are very heavy and
we just undo this and I can show you
properly so it is the most beautiful
precious stone I'm not sure we call this
is it like a graphite or there's
definitely a special word for this type
of rock but it's that sparkly stone and
it's got rose gold painting all the way
around it it's got glitter over it so it
really does look quite spectacular I
think if you really love to have very
special treasures on your tree
these are absolutely stunning it's quite
a rock-like on the back but inside it's
really beautiful and sparkly so I got a
white one and a purple one to be honest
I think I might just keep the white one
if any it is very beautiful it's not
heavy festive I guess
rocks being part of the Bible story oh
don't really know it is beautiful I
can't deny that but price-wise these
full-price are almost 30 pounds which is
actually insane for a Christmas
decorations so I'm gonna have to think
very hard about this when we get the
tree either tomorrow or the next day
I'll put it on the tree and see how
fabulous it looks because it really does
have to be something quite special for
nearly 30 pounds I think where
anthropology do their best is with the
box sets like the one that I showed you
earlier and then this one is a shimmer
snowflake LED string light set and it
comes in this presentation box so once
again it could be a really nice gift
maybe a housewarming if you know anyone
that's just moved in and getting some
nice Christmas bits to start them off
but I thought this would look really
elegant perhaps around the fireplace or
around I don't know one of the mirrors
in the house and it's very classic very
simple and this kind of thing is not
going to go out of fashion I know some
people have like stylized Christmases
and they try to change the theme every
year but this is the kind of thing I
know I will use Christmas after
Christmas so a bit of an investment
piece the way they wrap things to send
them it really is like Christmas Day
when you open them up not actually too
sure what this is it's very light
aha it's another set of Christmas
baubles very well that once again just
so beautifully presented you've got this
gift box type thing and then it's got
some tinsel inside it's wrapped up with
a beautiful bow tinsel and then kind of
shredded paper which just looks so so
beautiful and the BAL balls themselves
are a mixture of pastel colors you've
got some light pink light blue gold
silver really really beautiful and then
they almost look as though they've had a
bite taken from them and you can see
like the inside almost like some kind of
fruit and then you've got some slightly
more traditional ones as well so once
again just really nice light baubles
small baubles for filling in those gaps
and just making the tree look a little
bit more luxurious because after all
anthropology
they aren't slightly more special than
your average decoration I would say
that's everything for anthropology and
the next few pieces are from John Lewis
so I did a click and Collect to pick up
for my local Waitrose store which is
really really handy and the first thing
that I picked up are these LED twig
Garland's they looked amazing on the
website Aurora undone one and but I did
pick up two I think these will look
gorgeous
once again either side of the fireplace
I think sparkly lights indoors just look
so lovely in the festive season and to
be honest I think I will probably put
these up a little bit earlier next year
so I can have them around a little bit
longer but make sure you keep an eye on
my vlogmas maybe tomorrow's or the next
days and then you can see how we
decorate the house with these I also
picked up some wrapping paper from John
Lewis this one is just white with gold
flecks I thought that was very simple
and still quite luxurious looking and
then this one's a little bit more fun
it's got little chubby father
Christmas's all over it saying hello ho
and I picked up a couple of rolls of
each of these so I'm now all ready to
start wrapping my presents when we were
actually collecting the order I spotted
these in Waitrose and they are sparkly
tea lights and we have a wooden tea
light holder which we put by the
fireplace and you can very clearly see
the tea lights I think if it's in a cup
these would be a little bit wasted but
if you do have any candle holders where
you can see the tea light these are
really beautiful and sadly they're not
scented which i think is a bit of shame
but maybe you can't do scented and
glittery but this is an 18 pack cut
remember how much I paid for it and but
we also got them in silver I think it
was buy two get one free so I have a
feeling that we got the bit of a bargain
with these ones and then every year I
like to get a candle like this I know
the white company does one and it's
actually a little bit expensive for my
liking but this one from John Lewis was
a fraction of that price you can also
get them
kind of local shops if you know a shop
called Hudson's that's where I normally
get them from but we just haven't had
time to go to one this year so I picked
up this from John Lewis and it's the
festive scented wax and inside it you
can see there's like a pinecone there's
some oranges just festive things all
built into the wax and yeah we get one
of these every year just light it on the
coffee table in the evenings and it just
fills the lounge with a festive
fragrance which I just absolutely adore
last but not least Charlie and I picked
up a few pieces from next I've never
bought Christmas decorations from next
before but they had a really really good
selection this year and the first thing
that I picked up is there's the Barry
LED fairy light Garland I bought this
with the idea in mind to put it on the
fireplace behind me along the top to
create just a lovely glow all around the
fireplace so I've got fairy lights
planned for the sides and for the top of
it so it's going to be a bit of a
feature in the lounge
these are frosted berries which I think
look quite authentic if that makes sense
I don't like to have really fake looking
berries in the house I just don't really
like that look but these are things look
very real considering they are plastic
berries this was 25 pounds which i think
is pretty good when you go to garden
centers and things like that you can end
up spending a fortune on these kind of
things so I felt that was a pretty good
price the next few things in here are
actually dog related so I will show you
this is turning into a bit of a
Christmas decoration slash sausage dog
haul but yeah they have some really good
dog things in next as well this I just
thought was so handy wags and whiskers
super absorbent microfiber towel so
don't know about you but Dexter likes to
run through the grass when it's soaking
wet in the mornings when it's frosty and
he is absolutely soaking when he comes
in and it just takes up so much room in
our washing machine and on the dryer for
a proper towel so I thought this will
come in so handy I tried a microfiber
towel before when I've done that camping
and I know how good they are they're so
absorbent and they don't take up any
room this one has a dog print on it so
really useful to like chuck in the back
of a car for dog walks and ten pounds so
I thought that was a very very good deal
for that one
okay this one I am extremely excited
about Charlie and I have been looking
for a winter jacket for Dexter for so
long and I was not expecting to find
something it's so perfect in next but
how cute is this it's got velcro
fastenings so hopefully it can go nice
and securely around little chaps tummy
and it's got a collar detail it's this
beautiful kind of waterproof material it
reminds me a little bit of my jewels
coats so we'll be matching matching I
mean it's go for a walk and this one was
12 pounds I really think that next is a
bit of a underdog excuse the pun when it
comes to dog clothing I just thought
this was such a classic piece once again
potentially a good gift idea if you know
anybody who likes to dress up their dogs
I'll just get all the dog fits over and
done with this next one is a festive
jumper a lot of you guys have been
commenting on my flock I must say you
can't wait to see what festive jumpers
Dexter wears but we don't actually have
that many for him yet but I still this
one on next and thought it was gorgeous
it's got snowmen snowflakes and then the
beautiful just fair I'll print it's got
little holes here for his little legs
and it's nice and long as well so I feel
like this was made with sausages in mind
and this one was eight pounds okay I
thought that was the last sausage dog
thing that I was wrong this next one is
just a really silly cushion so it's got
a Christmas decorated sausage dog on
skis I mean how much more bonkers can
you get so this is the dachshund wearing
a Christmas jumper and a Santa hat and
it says dachshund through the snow oh my
gosh if my eye suddenly looks really
bloodshot it's because I just flung
myself in the eye with a corner of this
coaching staff getting so excited about
festive sausage dogs and but yeah this
is just absolutely adorable you've got a
sausage dog wearing his Christmas outfit
and it says dachshund through the snow
which is just absolutely brilliant this
is going to have pride of place in our
lounge and I'm sure Dexter is going to
love it I can't wait to get home later
on this afternoon and see all of these
sausage dog pieces which we picked up
for him and then the final thing that I
got from next
one is not strictly festive but I do
feel like stars are you know it's their
time to shine literally this time of
year and I thought that this would just
be fine throughout the rest of the year
as well so it's a doormat and Charlie
and I needed a new one we've had the
same doormat since we moved in in 2012
and it's got just emboss stars on it it
was 10 pounds and I just thought this is
really lovely wine it for people to wipe
their feet on when they come into the
house so that was my final a little
treat from next and last but not least I
actually picked up this little bundle of
Christmas items there's pinecones and
berries and then some twigs I actually
picked these up for blog props more than
anything to take some vlog photos with
but these were from Sainsbury's I just
chucked them and Charlie when we were
doing our weekly shop so I thought I
would show you those as well it's really
good to check those kinds of aisles and
supermarkets I also find Sainsbury's
scented candles little tea lights are so
good and they have a really lovely and
festive scent which actually is reminded
me speaking the festive scent I do have
one more thing from next hold on a
second
okay I found two more things to show you
this is a diffuser from next and
Charlie's mum got us hooked on these and
it's the winter collection the winter
fragrance from next winter that's
candles diffusers or anything along
those lines is heavenly I always think
it smells nicer
even than jo Malone and the white
company it smells so beautiful and much
more affordable this is a diffuser and
we like to put these in the lounge at
shut the door light the fire and then
the whole room smells absolutely
heavenly we do have quite a few scented
things in here so maybe we'll put this
in the corridor or in one of the
upstairs bedrooms but once again so
affordable I'm probably going to pick up
a few more of these before the season is
done and then I have one more piece from
Anthropologie which was hiding behind
the sofa lovely just found it how cute
is this
it is a gingerbread house Christmas tree
charm luckily it's really light so
hopefully it won't cause the branches of
the tree to hang down too much this was
12 pounds once again not cheap for a
Christmas tree decoration but how cute
is this I saw also even if you don't use
it
tree just as an ornament to be honest I
might put it on the fireplace I would
hate to think of Dexter charging under
the tree this falling off and breaking
because it really is so precious it's
got sparkly white icing on it it does
look so real honestly if they were
children in the house I'd be a little
bit worried because this looks so edible
so that's everything that I've picked up
recently in my Christmas decoration of
all Charlie and I did also go to a
garden center recently called long acres
new and my mum lives and we picked up
loads of pieces from there but we left
them in mom's car because there was too
much for us to carry so if you want to
see what we got from there and also
decorate the house with us then make
sure you are subscribed and watching my
vlogmas videos it'll hopefully be in
maybe number five or six so definitely
keep an eye on those to see what we got
from the garden centers and to see how
we transform our lounge and the rest of
the house for Christmas if you guys have
picked up anything fabulous for your
Christmas decorations then let me know
because I am always looking out for any
new ones especially sausage stock ones I
know John Lewis had a sausage or
Christmas tree charm but it's sold out
so if you guys see any others then do
let me know because you know how they
are making sausage dogs really hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did you
know the journal please give it a thumbs
up and I really hope that you are
enjoying vlogmas it's been so nice just
letting me know what we've been up to
during this festive month so I really
hope you guys are enjoying it give this
video a thumbs up if you enjoyed this
one and I will see you very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
