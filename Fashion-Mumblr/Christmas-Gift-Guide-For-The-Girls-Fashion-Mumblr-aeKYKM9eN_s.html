channel I hope you're all really well
and I'm getting into the festive spirit
of things today's video is going to be
my Christmas gift guide and I know that
there are already so many Christmas gift
guides out there and they're all
absolutely fabulous but I thought that
at this time of year there's no such
thing as getting too much inspiration
when it comes to buying your Christmas
gifts so I thought that I would add mine
into the mix to give you a few more
ideas on some things you can pick up for
a lady in your life this Christmas and
all of these things would work really
perfectly for a bestfriend a mom and
anteus sister itself if you're feeling
like you want to treat yourself and of
course I've made sure that all of these
things are still available and also will
arrive in time for Christmas so no need
to worry about any last-minute shopping
I'm going to kick things off with
something which is really special to me
because it's a brand that is actually
very close to Charlie and I Charlie
bought me a bracelet from merci maman as
one of the very first gifts that he
bought me and he got it engraved with
the date that we met and it's something
that I absolutely always wear so when I
discovered their new collection and saw
but it was also personalizable I thought
what a fabulous gift for Christmas and
it doesn't have to be a girlfriend I
think this is such a beautiful treat
that you could also give it to a mum a
sister anybody that really deserves that
special touch and I think at
Christmastime jewelry is that one gift
that is just so so so special so let me
show you what's inside all the messy
mungyeong gifts come in this beautiful
gift box so you don't even need to wrap
it anymore if you don't want to I might
pop this in the little gift bag so it's
beautiful orange box tied up with a bow
and inside I've gone for a necklace so
this is the boho necklace it's 18 karat
gold plated and it features a beautiful
rose gemstone and then this main charm
in the middle is that beautiful a
hammered metal which I find so effective
it catches the light but not in a really
sparkly way just very delicate very
simple and very classic and then on the
other side you can get it personalized
with up to eight letters and they do
that here in their London studio this
one here is actually something that
Charlie said that he'd like to get for
me but I got a little bit
so that I could share it with you guys
so this one has got my name on it it
says Josie and it's also written in the
beautiful handwriting style which I
think just adds even more of a personal
touch and it looks so effective when
it's on because it's a beautiful long
length and it's got these little also
small and hammered discs as well so
really effective if you wear it over a
really plain t-shirt perhaps or over
some knitwear you're going to be seeing
me wearing this an awful lot over the
coming weeks but as well as necklaces
like this which I'd say are a little bit
more fashionable they also have some
classic pieces like the bracelet that
you guys have seen me wearing time after
time and also rings earrings more
necklaces so many classic styles as well
as these more feminine and trend led
pieces so messy mamaan for me has always
been a go-to for Christmas gifts so
that's the first thing I wanted to
include in my Christmas gift guide and I
also have a discount code to share with
you guys so if you did want to treat
yourself or anyone else to a Christmas
gift from merci maman you can use the
code josie 15 and that will entitle you
to 15% off your order so a little bit of
a discount for your Christmas wish list
my second gift is also personalizable I
think that personalizing gifts at
Christmas just adds that really lovely
touch and it's something that again you
wouldn't really do for yourself but it's
really lovely to receive something
personalized and this is a scarf from
Bandits London it's actually a faux fur
scarf but as far as faux fur goes this
is probably the best most luxurious and
realistic looking faux fur scarf that I
think I've ever seen even the fact that
the fur within it is like different
textures it's not all one type of folks
that makes sense so it really does look
incredibly real the colors of this one
are so me there are loads of different
color options I'll leave a link to the
website down below for this and
everything so you can see all the
different options but I've gone for this
beautiful blush pink and then baby pink
down the bottom I think it's so feminine
so it's still so classic at the same
time so I have my initials on here you
can get your initials put on them of
course you're not going to choose my
initials unless your initials are also J
at but a really lovely thing to do to
personalize something so chic and so
classic
someone for Christmas I think this would
look gorgeous over a coat or even over
some knitwear and there are some really
classic colors as well you can get like
a pure leopard print design you can get
black ones brown ones definitely take a
look at the website because I think
these are really affordable considering
the quality you've got this beautiful
silk lining this one was around the 50
pound mark and they're all around that
kind of price point depending on which
style you go for so that's a beautiful
gift from bandits London this next one
is absolutely beautiful and it is a
luxurious leather-bound zipped up
notebook
this one says creme de la creme on it I
was just really attracted to this
beautiful pink metallic leather and the
fact that it's just a luxury version of
an everyday item I don't know about you
but I find that so many people that I'm
having to buy gifts for this year are
impossible to buy for and my usual
tactic is to buy them an upgrade on
something that's maybe quite an everyday
item something they use all the time but
buy the more luxurious version so that's
what drew me to this because it's just
so beat what's so luxurious but at the
end of the day it's just a notebook so
it's a really practical item the pages
inside are unlined so great perhaps if
you know someone that's a little bit
artistic they like to doodle they don't
like to stick within the lines but it's
a really lovely one to keep in the
handbag too because it is zip so if you
have any important files or papers you
could also keep it within this this one
was 34 pairings so not cheap for a
notebook but once again as it is a
little bit more luxurious than your
usual notebook gift I really think it
adds that that beautiful luxury elements
to make it a fabulous gift I couldn't
possibly do a Christmas gift guide for
you guys without including a candle and
this year I've decided to include one
from me on this is that Christmas wish
handle and it's the full wick one so a
little bit more luxurious in your usual
candle this one as you can imagine I
don't even need to tell you it smells
incredible fills the room with the most
beautiful festive fragrance but what for
me makes neon stand apart from all the
other candle brands is the brand behind
it so neon is all about creating those
scents that make you feel happy that
make you feel more relaxed just make you
feel less stressed out and I think that
is so important everyone that I speak to
these days is stressed they just
something to help them chill out and
that's exactly what this does I find
these fragrances so therapeutic that
when I like them all my troubles sound
so cheesy but they do just seem to melt
away because it really does fill the
room with this really lovely relaxing
ambience neon also use organic
ingredients and they're real advocates
of stopping animal testing so that's
just another reason why I absolutely
love the brand this candle is 40 pounds
and I feel that that's actually a very
good price for a free wick candle that's
so luxurious you can often end up
spending over a hundred pounds in a
3-bit candle from other brands so I feel
that this is a really good affordable
version of a very luxurious candle and
so my next gift is the Viktor and Rolf
flower bomb voluptuous body cream even
the name just tells you how sumptuous
and how luxurious is body cream is I
absolutely love the packaging this comes
in the beautiful big pink and black
flower bomb box seats find similar to
the perfume then inside you get this
absolutely beautiful glass body cream
with the usual Viktor and Rolf style lid
and then inside the cream as you can
imagine it has the same fragrance as a
flower bomb perfume oh my god absolutely
something else this has got to be my
favorite fragrance of all time you can
you can quote me on that this was the
fragrance that I wore all throughout
like 6:1 my early 20s and still I'd have
to say it is my favorite fragrance by
wearing a body cream it does help the
smell to linger on the body a little bit
longer and really intensify that
fragrance so if you know someone that is
also obsessed with flower bon then I
think this would be a fabulous gift or
even if they're not perhaps they wear
another perfume the scents in this are
jasmine rose freesia orchid M patchouli
I think and all together they blend to
make the most wearable and likable
fragrance I don't think I've ever met
anyone that doesn't love the flower bomb
fragrance so I think this is a really
lovely luxurious gift for someone who
just loves to pamper themselves and to
smell absolutely amazing honestly if you
guys haven't smelt Flowerbomb you need
to your own smell it ASAP it is the best
smell in the world and then for the
beauty lover that has it all I've chosen
the Marc Jacobs object of desire gift
set so this is
unlike any other beauty gift set because
wait until you see this so not only does
it come in this beautiful gold packaging
but then inside look at this oh my gosh
I don't think I've ever seen a more
beautiful palette so the products inside
within this beautiful gold clutch which
I don't know about you but I would
definitely use this on a night out and
then inside the clerk's you've got this
big mirror and then the actual palette
itself look at that so this is a full
face palette you've got a blush a
bronzer and illuminator and then six
eyeshadows so everything you need to
create a really beautiful glowing
festive look all of these colors are so
wearable you've got my favorite like
champagne shades and then some mushroomy
purple shades for that beautiful
slightly sparkling festive smokey eye
and all within this absolutely beautiful
case Marc Jacobs beauty is not
everywhere it's not one of these brands
you see in every single department store
so that element of exclusivity is what
makes me think this is a really good
gift for a beauty lover who you really
struggle to buy for you think they got
it all but I'm pretty sure they won't
have this another brand that for me
really sums up Christmas is lots of time
they always have the most fabulous gift
sets and every year for my mom I buy her
L'Occitane hand cream it's almost become
a bit of a tradition this year they have
a new fragrance this is their Arliss yin
hope I'm saying that right a new scent
and it's rose sweet violet and saffron
which is system most beautiful warming
but very floral scent this is the travel
set it's 20 pounds so a really great
affordable way of trying out the
fragrance especially if you know someone
that's a lakhs ton fan but you maybe
want to treat them to something a little
bit new from the range and inside you
get a lip balm a soap and also of course
a hand cream all in a handy travel size
so really good to test out the products
before perhaps treating yourself to a
full-size version and then a fashion
mumbler Christmas gift guide would not
be complete without some Joan Malone I
just I just couldn't do it to you guys I
had to include some dome alone and this
year they have some
limited-edition fragrances out and let
me tell you they are something else they
really are out of this world and I've
chosen for this gift guide there are new
orange bitters fragrance this is a
limited edition
it's 90 pounds for the fragrance but it
is so worth it worth every penny if I
could sum up this fragrance I would say
it's like oh my gosh like a warming
Christmas cocktail that is how I would
stop this one up as well as being
festive it's also very wearable you've
got notes of sandalwood and amber in
there which I think are really popular
ingredients because they're just so
luxurious but so wearable at the same
time it's the kind of scent that you
really just enjoy inhaling and it's very
therapeutic and relaxing as well to just
inhale these kind of fragrances in but
still festive as well I think it's that
orange bitter in there that really makes
it oh my god it's mouth-watering I just
want to smell like this all year round
little own just the festive season and
but also the german-owned festive
collection this year is in this
beautiful almost like a Harlequin print
and it just makes a little bit more
unusual so great if you know a Joan
Malone collector perhaps because this
will really stand out from the rest of
their Joe Malone collection okay and
that is everything that is my edit of my
favorite Christmas gifts for her I
really hope you guys enjoyed looking
through those with me of course you
