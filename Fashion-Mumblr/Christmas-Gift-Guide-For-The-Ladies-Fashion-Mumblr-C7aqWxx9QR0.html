Christmas gift guide video ever and my
first Christmas gift guide video
obviously of 2015 I've been so excited
to film this video I've got the red lips
on I've got the Christmas presents in
the background and I'm feeling festive
so I cannot wait to show you a few bits
and pieces which I've picked up from the
high street from high end just loads and
loads of pieces which i think are gonna
make amazing Christmas presents this
year so I'm not going to do a huge long
runway intro because I've got quite a
pile of things next to me to show you so
I'm gonna get straight stuck in them the
first Christmas present that I have
picked up this year is this beautiful
limited edition box from Joe Malone it's
not just the box that I wanted to talk
about the box first because it's got a
hand-painted scene of London on it so I
got this from The Regent Street flagship
which is newly opened and yet it's a
hand-painted box which is absolutely
beautiful
I'm pretty sure that you can get this
done throughout the Christmas period
inside you get a beautiful candle and
matches kit the German load matches are
just living room goals I absolutely love
them they're so beautiful I don't use
them because they're too pretty but you
know they look they look beautiful on
the mantelpiece and then also inside is
a candle so I've picked up pomegranate
in a while pomegranate la is by far my
favorite German own fragrance it's my
favorite one to wear it's my favorite
one to have in the house this is just
I'm thinking it's probably one of the
most popular ones so a great gift idea
as well this scents my living room
within moments of the candle being lit
even when the candles not let my room
smells lovely but as soon as I liked it
the whole living room just has the most
incredible fragrance I think this one as
well is really good for year-round not
just for Christmas so I think overall
makes a lovely gift German is so lovely
luxurious and sometimes you don't want
to splash out on a lovely candle for yes
so for a mom or sister or a special
daughter or just a special but you know
I mean I think this is a absolutely
lovely Christmas gift so this next gift
is absolutely perfect for any beauty
lovers that you might know anybody
that's really into that skin care and
really wants to step up their skincare
routine and it's the Keith Haring
collaboration with Clarisonic so keep
throwing it is a non-profitable
organization and Clarisonic have teamed
up with them to create those really cool
design on the mio to Clarisonic the box
is really funky as well perfect for
picking up under the Christmas tree but
the Clarisonic is as you can see good
Old Faithful near to I absolutely love
my mere cleansing brush I use it maybe
three or four times a week I've spoken
about it loads before and yeah this is
just a limited edition so it makes some
really lovely gift also comes with this
really cute carry case which at the
moment has got all the charging items
inside it and yet a really cute little
Clarisonic key fob for the for the zip
as well so yeah I think that this is
just the most perfect gift for anybody
that's really incest skincare maybe if
you know somebody that's been thinking
about getting a facial cleansing brush
then because it's a limited edition and
it has this really cute design on it I
think this is just such a lovely gift
next I've got the Euro Party Christmas
gift set from Benefit Cosmetics benefit
always put together the most incredible
sets for Christmas and they're always
such incredible value they nearly always
sell out so definitely make sure you go
and grab this as soon as you can if you
know somebody that absolutely loves
benefit makeup let's have a little look
at what is inside this one but first let
me show you it's kind of like a carousel
through the box is this really cool like
carousel design with a little inside bit
which spins around for this what is
inside which gets me really excited so
you've got a little mini of the hula
gloves and a mini of the Porefessional
which is just amazing ways of testing
out the products we also get to the
full-size things on
which includes people which includes
the hoola bronzer which has got to be
one of the best bronzers most classic
infamous bronzers that is out there so
you get full-sized benefit hoola bronzer
inside complete with the little brush
and camera in the lid and also the
classic they're real mascara so you just
cannot go wrong with this kits perfect
for any makeup lovers anybody that I
know that loves makeup would absolutely
love to receive these too and it's
always such a good value buying the kit
and serve the products separately and so
much nicer to have something cool like
this under your treat as well so up C
love this kit and so many more from
benefit this year this next one is good
for someone who maybe has a lot of
really good makeup and skincare already
but is looking to try some new brands
and maybe hasn't discovered caudally
before quarterly is a French brand and I
absolutely love all their products that
face miss as serums you guys read the
blog you'll know how obsessed I am with
quarterly and this is their vine of body
luxury set so great for maybe a mum or
an auntie someone that really just
deserves to have a little bit of
pampering products in their life and it
contains an incredible vine body butter
and Cordelia body butters are absolutely
heavenly so this is going to be an
absolute beautiful one it's got a lip
conditioner which is perfect for popping
in the handbag and then also a hand and
nail cream so it's not like you don't
have to know somebody's skin care
routine really well to get this gift I
think it's just a lovely thing to buy
someone who just deserves a little
pampering treat cordially have a few
different Christmas gift sets out this
year I just thought this was this is
definitely my favorite one and the
packaging as well really beautiful and
again much better value to buy in a gift
set than the products separately another
gift set with beautiful packaging is the
beauty sleep organic collection from
Neal's Yard remedies this one I think
again really really good for mums
anybody that's quite stressed or lives
like a really busy life and just needs a
little bit more sleep I know it's kind
of like a random thing to say but I
think with certain skincare products you
have to know the person's skin quite
well whereas nobody doesn't want to have
a good night's sleep so I think this is
a really lovely gift for any
in your life and let's have a little
look what's inside box itself is really
cute I'll definitely be keeping this box
or whoever I give it to you'll be
keeping this box for a long time so
you've got the beauty sleep concentrate
here this is basically a pillow mist you
spritz it on the pillow and it just
helps you to relax and so fall asleep a
little bit more quickly then you've got
the beauty sleep body butter this is
fragrance twig organic in lanky line
essential oil so it's really good for
just again calming the mind stopping any
anxious worries which will help you
drift off to sleep much quick quickly
and then you've got the beauty sleep
bath milk so this is a really again
luxurious product pop a few drops into
your bath and not only is it very
calming on the mind but also lovely and
soft and nourishing on the body so I
think this is a really great set for
anyone who just needs to chill out a
little bit but it's not it's not
offensive you buying it's just saying
look you deserve to have a lovely night
sleep and have some lovely pampering
products this next one is so lovely
because in the shop in Covent Garden you
can personalise the ribbon it's a
Clinique box set and I hope mom's not
watching as I personalized is ready for
her but you can write anything you want
on the ribbon so I've written Merry
Christmas
Lilla I call her Lola I'm not gonna go
into why because she'll kill me
love Joey so yeah it's really really
lovely touch that you can personalize
the ribbon I'm not gonna open it up
because it looks so perfect but
basically Clinic have a variety of gift
sets in their common garden profit which
you can choose from I've gone for one
with a lovely body butter inside a
refreshing face mist and moisturizer and
a hand cream which I think are all just
really nice products which is sometimes
sometimes you don't splash out on
yourself but you know they're just
lovely pampering treats which any mom or
any auntie or sister would absolutely
love but again it was the packaging
which absolutely sold this to me I think
it's so beautiful and I know so many
ladies that would love to find something
like this under their Christmas tree if
you know anybody that really loves to do
their nails then this is such a great
Christmas gift so this is the red carpet
manicure gel polish Pro kit and it comes
with a gold UV curing lamp so this is a
nail kit which contains everything you
need to keep yourself at home gel
manicure I've written about this on the
blog many times before and I just think
it's such a perfect Christmas gift it's
not the cheapest it's around the 80
pound mark but I think if you know
somebody that loves to go to salon and
get their gel nails done this could save
them an awful lot of money so basically
inside you get the lamp base coat top
coat remover cuticle oil structuring oil
to strengthen the nails and everything
you need to basically give yourself and
apps home gel and manicure with the
gorgeous gold lamp so yeah if you know
anybody that loves to go to some and get
their nails done or if anyone loves to
do their nails at home then this is just
such a lovely gift set the case that it
comes in is really handy as well it's
like a black almost faux crocodile skin
with a gold tips that really luxe luxe a
really luxurious looking present and
another one for a beauty lover
this is the zoeva rose golden pink eye
brush set so I have had this on my
personal wishlist for so so long and
also really really hoping to get the
makeup brush set for Christmas these
brushes are so beautiful if you know
anybody that's really into makeup which
ones you don't even need to be really
into makeup to get this because they're
so stunning the brush has come in this
beautiful pink carry case I still have a
black one as my humbag makeup bag and
even the even the toggle on the zip is
really beautiful inside you get 12
makeup brushes now these are now this
set is basically everything that you
need to create basically any eye look
you've got everything from a concealer
brush to a blending brush to a liner
brush so basically everything you could
possibly need for eyeshadow and that's
so beautiful
I mean look at the packaging they are
light pink with the rose gold bit at the
top there these were all the rage
earlier in the year but I still think
they make the most fabulous gift anybody
that loves makeup or just loves and
beautiful things loves rose gold it's
just just such a good present I think
these are such good values the Weaver
brushes are just so well known in the
blogging community in
being incredible quality and I'm just so
pleased that I finally have these
brushes and I think that you could make
so many people happy by getting them
these brushes for Christmas I'm very
aware that the lighting is going even
though it's only three o'clock in the
afternoon but luckily this is the last
gift and this is quite a personal choice
so maybe something that if you know
somebody's been asking about something
like this or it just could be a cheaper
alternative to anybody considering
getting laser hair removal so this is
the smooth skin gold IPL hair reduction
system so yeah I don't think this is the
kind of gift that you could just by
anybody I think it has to be showing
somebody that's shown an interest in
laser hair removal maybe they're really
into that and beauty treatments or if
they were considering getting it done in
the salon and the soy skin gold is
really well known on the market which
has been super speedy so if you know
someone it's really busy doesn't have
time to sit there waxing or shaving
every day this can do the whole body in
under 20 minutes which is absolutely
amazing when I first tried IPL about a
year ago it just used to take forever to
do the whole body so this is incredible
that it's the fastest one on the market
and so that's it's I hope you guys have
enjoyed my first Christmas gift guide of
2015 I think there are so many really
lovely products in here and for beauty
lovers in particular there's just so
many great things on the market as yes I
hope I've given you an idea on some of
my personal favorite things that are out
