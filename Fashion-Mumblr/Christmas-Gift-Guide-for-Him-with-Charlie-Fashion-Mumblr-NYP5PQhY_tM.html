Christmas gift guide this time Christmas
gift guide for him and as I did last
year I have got Charlie with me in the
video and this year Charlie chose all of
these gifts actually that you guys
yeah it's actually pretty difficult
narrowing it down to just ten yeah I
gave Charlie a maximum of ten because
you want it to include about 500 in you
well it is difficult cuz I've got ideas
fire free one and of course this year
Charlie's blogging so you've been you've
had your eyes open to a lot more yes
this year a lot more brand-new new
products and stuff so we have a big
selection of gift ideas for him where
that's a father or a brother or a
boyfriend or any man in your life
ranging from grooming that scenario you
should do a dog gift I said that we
should do next that could have could
have choose chosen the gifts we could
have laid them all out on the floor we
could have laid them all out on the
floor and then whichever ones he went to
could have been his choices fun game
leave a comment down below if you reckon
we should do that in vlogmas also do you
like our Christmas jumpers
good luck mine's better if I stand up
yeah nice nice quite a point I think
Dexter's is the best so where should we
start darling you've got some good stuff
let's go with grooming products start
with okay yeah okay so we have this as
Phillips series seven thousand seven
thousand sounds like a supercar yeah so
I mean I I sort of have been testing out
a lot of different shavers this year
yeah it's difficult because I'm still
sort of like deciding on what I actually
want be in terms of like an overall
shaver this is a really good product is
designed with like sensitive skin in
mind okay
so obviously when you show you certainly
when you wet shave which I do very
rarely you can get real irritation and
red marks which is really frustrating
this gives you quite a clean shave but
it doesn't create the redness and the
irritation that you would associate with
shaving tools it says it's got an anti
friction micro-b coating on the comfort
ring that's a lot of work snazzy
but I think I think the other nice thing
as well is it's got lucky I don't know
if you can see this it's a bit shiny but
like an additional it's an additional
tool which you can like trim your
sideburns and and potentially just give
yourself a trim yeah if you're not going
for full shade look that's nice because
I prefer you tell a little bit of length
yeah yeah 100% and I mean I think the
other thing that's nice about this is
you could using the shots this way I
think um yeah it's waterproof so yeah I
don't know I've never really shaved in
the shower I think in the mirror
I'm not comfortable yeah it's a nice
gift and I think it yeah it's always
nice to get something for someone that's
a little bit high-tech yeah this one is
fairly high end as far as shavers go I
think this one is around 250 pound mark
so I think it's probably good for
someone that you know maybe has suffered
from sensitivity with shaving perhaps I
mean I know a lot of you guys are moms
so perhaps have you got like a son or
even a nephew that has problems with
like redness and this would be a really
good idea then but in an investment but
maybe it's not something that the guy
would necessarily want to splash out on
for himself so really thoughtful
presents great if your boyfriend
yeah I'd say yeah if you're feeling
spend on your boyfriend then this is a
good one so on the lines of grooming we
addressed shaving post shaving or pre
shaving oh runway good stuff so this is
actually a little gift set from Kiehl's
now keels are quite nice they do have
gift sets on their site that are already
sort of pre chosen products but what's
quite nice if you have a store near you
is to go into the store and just can
pick a few products that you think would
suit whatever you're buying for you yeah
so i hand-picked these products with my
dad in mind so and then they give you a
little worse back to take them away dad
would use that a lot of the flight yeah
so I mean I'll give you a really quick
rundown
this one's an oil Eliminator sort of
exfoliating face wash
so it could be used every day if you've
read my blog you know I love exfoliating
a bit too much so that's a nice product
my favorite product from Kiehl's which
is their face fuel range which is this
this is their moisturizer within the
Facebook fuel range it's just a really
nice everyday moisturizer and this one
has SPF in which I'm gonna be writing
about a little bit next years I think
it's quite a big thing
SPF needing to needing to protect our
skin against the sunlight even in very
rainy England so yeah yeah exactly
a few more products I don't know what my
dad's gonna feel about it about this but
I love eye cream oh yeah this has a
midnight recovery eye cream which I
actually needed this morning because
Dexter was barking it was like having a
baby wasn't a newborn I felt like we
were a newborn parents like I had to
come down that three times about 3 a.m.
so that's a nice product something a bit
new for maybe a dad or your boyfriend
and finally cilantro and orange so
obviously that's coriander isn't it I've
not tried this before so that's why I
bought it
pollutant defending market which is
another product that to be honest my dad
wouldn't probably normally use face
masks no I know but I think we all know
once again like power to the guys we all
need to start using face masks more like
I don't know why the girl a girl should
have all the fun you've always used my
face masks yeah well I have face masks
before I met you didn't oh and finally
this is actually the product that's
probably most perfect for dance is an
age defender power serum says their age
defender inch which I actually really
like I guess you can start using a
defender even when you're being right no
not you let me so yeah so that's just a
really nice gift set but as I say you
can just design it yourself yeah perfect
following on again sort of male grooming
this is one of my new fad new favorite
fragrances of 2016 so that's John 1040a
John for these packages always epic yeah
it's in like a can't in and actually
this is their new LeMay oh why if I can
get open oh man yeah so they've revamped
the bottle
I don't know if you can see Shepard it
don't actually open crystally it's a
really sleek bottle design I love water
design and as you smell it it's a little
bit but you know I think it's a little
bit more I don't know what's the word
more advanced than their normal one yeah
and I would wear that on an italic yeah
growing up I didn't want to use that
term but you've used it yeah definitely
a little bit more grown up a little bit
more mature yeah it looks really cool as
well it's nice you kind of have to pull
this thing off
yeah I mean they've always had those
clips but this one's a little bit harder
to lose which is good I mean so yeah if
you're looking for a free I mean
fragrance is always a good gift at
Christmas yeah
everyone needs fragrances just don't buy
them on eBay
why too many fakes yeah to be honest
like I think nowadays with online you've
gotta be careful with fragrances yeah I
would actually I'm not going into a
perfume shop
I'm actually looking under minute like a
website is fine but on eBay you can get
like but part of the farming of
Christmas shopping is doing it actually
purchasing something for taking anyway
but yeah so that's a really nice bag so
the next gift idea is a brand that I've
only really started wearing recently and
I'm actually wearing I'm wearing one now
in rotary watches which is a really nice
Brown Swiss made but I split enough oh
she says but they're really good value
for Swiss made yeah which is nice
because normally Swiss made watches are
crazy expensive so I guess choice you'll
do a close-up but this one in particular
and I think we'll have to probably put a
link because I don't know what it's
called is just a really nice design like
it's very flat to the skin
yeah and it's got a cheeky um it's got
it's got quite a nice sort of dark
leather strap that's nicely but quite
thin so it's really nice with the show I
feel like that's good for all ages like
that's kind of watch that you would give
to maybe like I don't know a brother or
someone and they would use it forever
because it's so timeless yeah I think
well that's the point you could wear it
with a cardigan or a jump or even just a
t-shirt or a shirt and it would look out
of place yeah
so to be honest as a watch for a
grandchild nephew you know someone
that's even a bit younger it would be it
would be quite good so yeah I think I
think it's definitely worth having a
proper look on the rotaries website and
I think if I'm right in saying there are
like Julia's like aged Samuels actually
stop really watches so just go and have
a look so next is something a bit
different and you might you guys might
think why is he banging on about swim
shorts it's freezing cold outside
well everyone goes on like sort of early
not everyone know but it's the time of
year that people are booking or there's
anyway yeah so these are a pair of swim
shorts from a brand that I love Leo
Joseph yes you have the coolest patterns
they do and if you follow me on
instagram you'll see there's some really
nice pic pics of the actual shorts like
some detail once yeah they come in a bag
which is perfect so if you're on the
beach and the shorts are wet you won't
get changed is Charlie in the bag that's
a winner isn't Leo Joseph South African
no and this is the pattern on this
particular pair I mean it so extreme
enduros yeah as I say check my Instagram
Alex we've got some really good shots of
these but um shameless promotion
hello it's my blog my Instagram don't
worry about JC's YouTube don't why I'm
Dexter's Prime I Dexter good eléctricas
you daddy
Oh yours is neck fallen out your baby
good absolutely smooth and yeah the
detail on these is really nice and I
think they retail at about 55 60 pounds
which is I mean it's still higher end
but they are luxury they're all good
quality but it's significantly cheaper
than like a filmic win or all of our
round which are just madness
and yeah it's my go to swim shorts so
perfect
and it's nice that not everyone's heard
of them either exactly no one wants you
know no one wants to turn up you know to
a pool party or like go on holiday with
their mates on the end they aren't
wearing the same pair yeah and they have
lots of choice on the website but I
think this is a great gift I think for
my dad because they my dad you know as
you get older you got more holidays and
I just think I think it is a nice
something a bit different yeah from the
normal present also great also for a
girlfriend I think that's a really good
thing to get a boyfriend yeah drugs
yes exactly yeah because guys may not
necessarily know where to go cool some
in trance but girls watching this now
you know so we've also chosen this
backpack from foots and it's absolutely
gianormous I felt like this would be a
really good one for a blogger boyfriend
in particular because you can carry so
much stuff in here change your clothes
camera equipment 16 little dust pan
batteries and I really like the color
combination of this so it's kind of like
a mushroom you brown and then you've got
the brownie leather and I feel like male
backpacks are quite hard to get that mix
between being looking really good I mean
practical at the same time it's got the
thick strap so it's sort of smart enough
that you wouldn't feel bad you know I
don't know it's a small rock sack yeah
but it's casual enough that you could
you could even use as a gym bag but you
notice it's too nice for that yeah I
love the leather on this I feel like
once you've worn this quite a lot and it
gets a bit battered it's just gonna get
even nicer
mhm I mean we're off to Gothenburg
actually oh man this is gonna be perfect
yes as I said I'm actually keeping this
I'm not giving it to anyone and it's
actually got a laptop sleeve pocket as
well so really good if you maybe like
even a school bag so I clean I mean you
know lovely recycle to work really
really great for that handle and I
forgot to mention but everything that
we're talking about in this gift card
will of course be linked down below in
the description box so for any further
information prices etc check out the
links down below but yeah this one is
Forbes the newest backpack so gift idea
number eight number eight yes is is
you've got to have something alcoholic
in this gift guide right so this I mean
I love gin a lot of people love Jamie I
think the last few years
gins just taken
so this is actually rock Rose premium
Scottish gin now I actually came across
this because they won a taste taste of
waters in great taste
2016 so and it's made in Scotland which
is quite nice um that is British I mean
a lot of Jen's are British and you know
I just think it's a really nice gift for
maybe I mean they're not it's not
expensive so it's a nice gift for like
an uncle a grandparent is quite cool
packaging is what it looks quite like
it's a nice thing to receive it's not
just like a boring average gin bottle
that's just you know we could pick up in
Sainsbury's a little bit different a
little bit more special so yeah just
like a slightly more premium gin a
little bit nicer than the usual
alcoholic beverage to give someone
special at Christmas
okay so those are all sort of quite big
presents it's a yeah and I thought I
wanted to do a whole stocking for the
night but I don't think you guys would
want to listen to me at all so I just
chose two products that I thought would
be great for stocking for those whether
it be boyfriend I don't know fit your
stocking we do stock into each other but
Josie never figures out what present
small enough to fit in the stocking so I
have like an empty stocking and then a
huge present which I'm playing but I'd
rather have stocking so one is a candle
now it's interesting that I have my
brother over yesterday and he won't mind
me saying this but he yeah he's not very
much reminded to like new things like
but he's suddenly become obsessed with
candles I think guys are more yeah like
guys I'm walking so leg nur London is
the brand and these are actually made
specifically for men no yeah so I'll get
it out smells really good oh wow wow and
it's very mastering designer mean quite
and it's quite a contemporary design
paul on whistling this one's called and
that i'm really looking forward to
actually light ernest yeah because that
smells amazing so when we are at home
in the evenings Charlie always gets cozy
foot Envy when I've got my lovely cozy
snippet slippers on so we found this
pair of slippers from The White Company
I feel like the white companies just go
to shock when it comes like being cozy I
only would I could happily spend my
whole months salary slippers dressing
gowns but we've chosen these slippers
they are a Navy pair of slippers they're
40 pounds so again fairly luxurious as
far as slippers go but still not
extortion Utley expensive for a
Christmas gift for him and I think the
design it's just really easy to like
they're just maybe very simple but then
there's this beautiful really soft
material that you would expect from the
white company I like the fact that
they're slip-on as well yeah like I'm
not a big fan of slippers that you
actually have to put on like a shoe
cause it's inconvenient you know if you
run outside - sounds really boring oh my
god take the bin out or like chase
Dexter if he's ran after the postman
which he sometimes does you just want to
slip them off and stick your trains on
so I think there are they're really good
I'm finally stocking filler misses a TV
program that Joey hates but I absolutely
love probably my favorite program of
2016 not people just people just do not
know if anyone watching this would have
seen this or maybe they've watched their
boyfriends watching it a crocodile band
your boyfriend from watching yeah it's
an amazing show I mean it's been on for
a couple of years this is three series
you're right Dexter Dexter's a big fan
as well but yeah this is a book set
three series I think there's something
like 12 episodes it's just a great story
they're like that's about 10 pounds yet
your buddy gene aka the marathon's Vil
no guaranteed laughs I guarantee any
boyfriend be happy to receive this or
brother Oh heart should you be that'd be
another good one yeah but that's the old
that was the office moving the office
movie wasn't as good as I thought that's
why this beat the office movie in terms
of DVDs I think the other one that I
didn't have with me here is the night
manager which was actually now I think
that came out this year I think and that
for a day I did dad gift that's a great
gift I mean a lot of people watched it
yeah but both from the BBC which
you know clapping clap to the BBC for
actually handshake but ya know just a
really good stocking filler and
hopefully something that will be a nice
surprise so that's all of our gifts for
our 2016 Gift Guide for him I hope you
guys found this interesting are you
gonna do more on your blog and so I am
doing it when this goes live my blog
