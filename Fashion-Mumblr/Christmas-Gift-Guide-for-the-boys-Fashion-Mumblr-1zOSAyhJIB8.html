Christmas gift guide you may have
noticed I have a special guest on my
Channel today this is Charlie my
boyfriend you might have spotted him in
some vlogs before
and Charlie's come along for today's
video because we're going to do our
Christmas gift guide for him
so Charlie I have both picked out a load
of Christmas presents which we think
guys will absolutely love at this
Christmas so Johnny go first or shall I
I'll go first
so you'll start with a nice watch every
guy likes to watch your Christmas and
this is Daniel Wellington favourite good
start
yeah it's just really nice watches nice
dark brown strap nice blue harness if
you can see a little bit detail that
yeah that's different actually so I have
already haven't done your wellington
watch at the moment but it doesn't have
a date which is actually a bit annoying
so yes it's just really nice watch
pretty good value I think they're about
100 pounds they're not and they're not
more than a hundred pounds so it's a
nice gift
um hope you got your current went on no
I don't know but but yeah they come in
different strap colors and everything so
light there's a lighter on as well but
yeah just a really nice present just a
nice alternative to to to sort of stand
the watches yeah and I think they're
quite quite like a desirable they look
more expensive than they are yeah which
I think everyone likes yeah yeah if you
haven't got the budget comes in this
nice illuminates which is nice to have
like a Christmas tree or in your
stocking and my first gift is any kind
of beauty slash pampering gift of course
and this is the modern gentleman kit
from the body shop so it comes in this
really cool tin so it's like really easy
to wrap it's a perfect Rosen and yeah
nice gift box
yeah nice gift box and we have little
Dexter Dexter do you money what do you
think of this one game Anita
like so inside this gift set you've got
one of these lovely shaving brushes a
nice badger yeah they used to be but I
don't you that one that's surely they're
quite expensive normally budget Anna
yeah no this is this is a set animal
free synthetic one oh yeah of course
Body Shop yes the body shop yeah but
yeah they're pretty cool I've actually
got one of these I don't know if anyone
remembers the Bond film see which one
was that
no I was Casino Royale was and that
scene where that girl's putting is no I
don't think it's Skyfall anyway I went
out and bought one and I've used it is
pretty cool actually yeah makes you feel
pretty pro everybody wants to feel like
a pro in this yeah and you also have a
lovely and shave cream which is maca
root which i think is really good for
the skin
and you've also got a maca root razor
relief cream of that as well so really
nice kit whether maybe a little brother
yeah or dad present I don't think that I
didn't leave my dad uses one of those
book shaving creams a lot nicer on your
skin than the standard standard spray
stuff the gel stuff so yeah next one I
think this actually only came out
recently is Tom Claridge's and you
cooked one I'm obsessed with Tom
carriage he's a bit of a legend he's
lost a lot of weight actually look which
is impressive but but no I mean I
haven't actually really used anything
any of this yet but it's everyday
recipes so I mean in truth Tom carriage
fashion if you're looking for a healthy
food it's probably not the cookbook for
you because he loses a lot of likes I
like comfort face yeah it's when it's
quite wintery food I mean it's certainly
this will get you through January
February when when you're not drinking
more when when you're a bit bit
depressive Christmas is over but ya know
it's some good cook but love Tom
carriage I might try for us peas are my
Instagram actually so keep an eye out
for that
so the next one that I've chosen is a
pair of slippers from EMU you guys all
know
I am with my uni slippers I absolutely
love them I have a mo pair and they are
just like clouds on my feet but this is
a chocolate pair of guys slippers also
from EMU and they have the lovely
sheepskin lining and the color really
classic for guys I mean I think this
kind of thing you can get again for dads
or brothers they're very very comfy so I
wasn't meant to use these until we've
done the gift guide but I've use them
straight away yeah I'm not big into
slippers actually but because they're
slip on as not as opposed to a lot of
the ones that you have to actually put
on and they're just not as convenient
but they're really really cozy and comfy
yeah on a Sunday off to rugby when on a
broken back nice so yeah good gift and
these are quite like luxury slippers as
well I know slippers can be quite a
boring Christmas present some people
just think our slippers is a bit lame
but these are likely luxurious and
really good quality zippers so I mean I
think is a really good present so this
is actually one that I picked out I'm a
bit boring when it comes to men's
fragrances and I thought I guess
probably most people are that they have
there's one or two favourites so I don't
try a lot of new freitas but but yeah I
had a smell of this it's Dunhill icon
now the first thing you'll notice is
it's a very very cool bottle I mean I
work in advertising but I'm a sucker for
it and this is seriously cool bottle to
have on your better I take it on you on
your yeah in your bathroom cabinet
I don't know wherever you keep your
aftershave but yeah it's really nice um
smells good I know don't know how I can
explain smell it's quite it's quite
musky yeah it's just really good it's
quite a wintery smell I think I think
it's really quite nice well maybe not on
every day but more a special occasion
going out for dinner getting suited and
booted maybe but yeah so Dunhill I'm not
one of the other fragrances before but
yeah done he'll icon the packaging is
really cool though honestly I think they
may have spent more money on the
packaging than they have
laughter that's a really really nice
face it's really good and it's Matt I
like oh is it magnetic no it's not ah
mr. trick
note to self note to dumb hell if you
watch it don't know the next one that I
have picked for the Gift Guide is the UE
boom - and I've got the cherry color so
this is this is a portable speaker I'm
going to go down tricks it's really tiny
I'm this really awesome packaging again
which I can imagine it's gonna look
really cool under the Christmas tree but
the speaker itself is only this big
absolutely tiny but we tested it out we
went to the Black Forest last weekend
and this kicks out a hell of a lot of
sound really really good quality
speakers yeah so um so we went we went
to the launch party if they're otherwise
giveaway yeah it was a smaller on the
roll which is waterproof which we've
also got unknown we use that the hot tub
actually last weekend which is really
cool but no the cool thing is these are
connected by bluetooth so like so not so
I guess but they're a lot more
convenient if you're going you're going
out to any events or anything or if
you're going away for the week and you
need to just take a speaker with you as
Josie says they're actually really loud
I didn't choose the car that's probably
more of a girly car like for mamas they
do black and gray and stuff like that so
for like a treat for your dad or your
brother or or just anybody that likes
music gadgety yeah and they're pretty
good retail price will put off to find
out the prices yeah yeah it's not crazy
we'll go for another gadget as our own
gadgets so we all I mean people have had
them for a while these sort of wireless
phone charges certainly we all will run
out of battery and it's bloody annoying
from iPhone batteries aren't very good
this one is anchor yeah bit of a weird
name but it's brilliant so this I mean
it's quite big this one I use this for
work in my in my laptop bag it's got a
lot of charge it holds hours of charge
so so yeah it's a great gadget for
anyone I think it was about 35 quid on
Amazon yeah so I mean they make girls
ones or ones a lot smaller that you've
got
lipstick size right yeah but this one's
brilliant cuz you can charge two things
at once
so I charge my iPad and my phone at once
are you kiddin me if you knew some any
or any work anyone that works out of an
office so I outside of an office because
where I work there's often only a few
plugs I'm people of Mali already using
them say so yeah I recommend it really
good little gift comes in a nice little
pouch and then I had to buy this
separately which was a bit annoying but
it's just a mini iPhone cake or an
Amazon one but definitely worth getting
that as well if you're buying as a gift
so the next thing I have is kind of
similar to one that I already mentioned
but it's another men's grooming kit this
one is from the Neal's Yard or Neal's
Yard remedies and I absolutely love
Neal's Yard products myself I've just
started becoming obsessed with their
essential oils and I'd say and this one
is more suitable for guys that mainly
are really familiar with shaving that
the body shop is kind of like all might
not always like a beginners shaving kit
but this is one for guys that really
loved shaving and really want to use
some essential oils and their shaving
routine so you've got a calming
aftershave balm and this is cool Suzanne
protective skin you've got an
invigorating body wash so it's not just
shaving stuff up body wash in there as
well and then a close shave cream I mean
what's the difference between these two
well that's for after so the cream you
use obviously with the Brit well apply
it with a brush with your hands but
ideally abroad then you then your shave
then you put the car me off to jail
after enjoys and grapefruit sandwich
cooling on skin yeah the body to be
honest this body wash is probably gonna
go straight in my rub you back the
problem is is it my rugby club not many
people bring after shirt half the stuff
for the shower
so everyone mix you makes your body nice
I don't really want to be sharing that
one seriously good okay well just cuz
run shaving will finish on shaving with
this so this is the Bron cruiser face
now I know we've talked about wet
shaving
certainly during this time of year I
like to keep that stubble
keep a bit
on my face and so wet shaving is
probably not really maybe the option
this is great I haven't actually used
this one but I've used some of other
products that are similar so it can do a
number of things so it's got different
obviously different grades I guess so
you can shave it pretty close with the
with the electric razor or you can go
for slightly longer beard basically it's
for any type of grooming I mean the guy
on the front bit of a questionable beard
but yeah it does actually looks a bit
but yeah I mean the point is it's a nice
option to have the long side wet shaving
if you want to have a bit of stubble or
maybe a bit better shape on your face
yeah three and one essentially they love
trying words like that brands but yeah
that's cool let's go nice little gift
for for anyone oh yeah anyone in your
family that's a guy or maybe the grandma
yeah my dad's little horse isn't she I
think she's actually she's arrived the
average the average over 70 email maybe
maybe a cheeky gift so it wouldn't be a
fashion on the gift guide now a little
bit of fashion in that and try and I
both absolutely love super dry it's one
of the stores that we can both go in and
just separate and we'll both be content
if it's until show up or if it's in like
they've named in memory just one of us
is tapping our feet but we both love
super dry and I picked out this jumper I
think this is a really lovely you can't
go wrong kind of Christmas present so
it's got a very kind of flick old flick
old flex gray miles small style knitted
pattern and high neck it's just like a
classic Christmas jumper oh you can wear
this all with you come on
you could wear this pretty much half the
year really I mean it's it's is warm but
it's it's thin enough that you would
wear under a coat and you won't be too
hot yeah
but yeah it's just a really nice jumper
and as joe says like wearing it with
jeans or it's just nice on nice under a
coat or on its own okay so we've got
another body shop product here if I'm
honest I wasn't that familiar with the
body shop
I met Joyce and Joyce was really into it
and I mean apart from the fact that the
shop smells amazing and yeah plus I mean
obviously the ethical side of it is also
quite nice but yeah this is called a
rescue kit so to be honest I was
thinking this could be a really nice
Secret Santa gift if you get a guy and
see croissants at work I don't know the
retail price we'll find that out it
won't be much because it's quite a part
of gets post-party rescue kit so
actually when you open it up it's two
products but one I'm really looking for
Chinese what is the eye cream which I do
actually
confession use at the moment not this
one but another brand and the eye cream
I do notice a difference at the
puffiness under your eyes certainly if
you've got a hangover or if you're just
over you're tired and the other one is a
balancing face protector I mean
essentially just in everyday moisturizer
but yeah just a really nice sort of
stocking filler I guess or Secret Santa
probably probably yeah suitable for any
any ages as well just a nice gift and
once again a nice little box that it
comes in costume it's a really cool tune
you could definitely keep that might
keep your classes and oh yeah actually
that would be really have first aid or
will put your put it like you just
shaving stuff you need stuff in there
but yeah just another nice nice products
the body shop there so this next one I'm
really excited about and I'd be really
pleased if my boyfriend received this
because it means I could have some this
is a tenant biscuits from biscuit ears
now I think this is such a good
Christmas present not only is it just
like a lovely thing to open it's a nice
box as well yeah the box is really cute
it's got like a fair isle scheme pattern
on it it says biscuit ears on the top
there but you can't really go wrong with
biscuits they do including free version
so do loads of different versions for
different diets so inside you can see
all the different biscuits that are in
here there's loads more underneath as
well basically you've got a scarf
goggles skis and
bottle hats as well and biscuit ears
have loads of different designs so
whether your dad is into gardening or
skiing or I'm sure there's probably like
a handyman kit with spanners and screws
you know it's a nice it's a nice gift if
you're going back to Christmas even for
both of them as well or going to go to
any anyone task for Christmas party
every one with my flowers why it's a bit
boring why I'm something more
interesting yeah they're amazing they're
the hummingbird the biscuits no they are
the hummingbird of the biscuit market
yeah
next we've got one of my favourite
brands I don't buy a lot from not round
normally because to be honest it is
quite pricey and it's a real treat so
yeah so these these are the new food
Accord and gold so I'll take this one
first it's it's their shower gel body
wash it's unisex but I mean it's quite a
manly smell dude it's quite a strong
smell what meeting we had a chat with a
girl in the shop doom and she said oh
yes mate
black peppercorn is obviously the very
best black pepper on is the best selling
in across all brand stores globally but
food is sort of almost coming in there
now as an alternative and I really like
it I don't know if you can see but
there's like gold flecks in there I mean
it says it's actual real gold I don't
know how that works but it's it's pretty
gimmicky but pretty cool to be honest
and yet nice packaging so I mean I think
this is a perfect gift for someone that
that likes that likes the better things
in life maybe or your dad or anything
but yeah I'm going to enjoy using this
almost it's almost too pretty to use
though isn't it
and yeah I mean also the fragrance so
it's an Eau de Toilette
it's quite strong so I noticed that it's
more like even as notice wallah it's
more like a puff is it puffs up that's
showing you know more stuff you know my
stuff but ya know it's really nice it's
quite a small bottle so I'm dead it's
definitely one for like a special
occasion
you could but it's always two nights for
that like it's a really really nice
smell really strong and I find this
summer after shows you need one I'm
entering it I feel like you need like
five or six prays literally I think like
one of this nice really strong and my
last one is a really safe gift choice
another one from super dry and this is
just a lovely chunky knit scarf I just
think you can't go wrong with a scarf
again no guy that I know wouldn't really
like this it's a classic design it's
really really soft well sort of black
well it's more Navy yeah they're doing a
couple of colors though yeah I think
they're don't you cut the SuperDrive got
some really nice scoffs this year I mean
I it's ever since I saw them entered the
market or probably five or six years ago
maybe a bit longer than that
I've noticed that super dry their
accessories and men's accessories are
really good so gloves hats and scarves
um it's quite hard to find these nice
scarves and gloves oh yeah I mean so
many times they have like bubbles on or
they have fringing or and they don't
quite tragic and the donors and the
crazy amount on them either because you
lose them so I think maybe if you don't
really know the kind of fashion style
that the guy you're buying for usually
goes for then yeah this is a really
classic and you can't go wrong with
something like this best til last less
they lost so this might be brand that
not many of you have heard of is called
nobody with a cape and essentially they
make they make women's as well but they
make a lot of men's bags laptop cases
right now cases this I don't know if
it's going to adjust this to be honest
it's their new bag it's a tote it's sort
of a combination in a tote and a
rucksack
I've wanted a new bag I don't know can
you show it off a bit burning me his
hotness it's hard to but what I mean
what's cool about it is for one they're
all designed for like the modern-day
modern-day people are going to work
right so you've got some really cool
space in their laptops and you've got a
number of so I can't section laptop
section it's really well padded as well
which I think it's important when you're
going to carry that
I like this leather detail the straps
well this is the cool thing so it's the
backpack like this which is probably how
I'll use it and then you unclip the
straps and then you just fold them in
there and then it's just becomes if I've
done this right and that just becomes a
tote which I mean actually it's pretty
convenient I think it's a really good
bag if for someone that travels a lot
maybe yeah or even like that like that
that goes like this would be fantastic
for for traveling abroad by going on
business well business is you all at
hand luggage bag they gave us quite a
cool little tike emotional baggage
Josie yeah I mean have a look on that
site know me they did loads of really
cool bags and just quite cool designs
and actually as a guy I found it really
hard to find a nice backpack for work
that wasn't too scruffy like my gym one
got my North Face one and it wasn't too
leather and really really like a grand
basically unfortunately the mulberries
and stuff in this world all their
backpacks are really expensive so it's a
really nice sort of in-between
I think this retails around 150 pounds
which it's quite a lot but it is really
good quality and I'm looking forward to
using it yeah really looking forward to
using it yeah so that's that's I think
that's my favorite so that is it those
are all the pieces that we picked out
