brush this one has the actual brush

face cleansing and it has five different

mitts really good for circulation and
also this little metal pad which is
amazing for giving yourself a pedicure
so this is the best of the bunch the top
prize is definitely the best giveaway
out of all of the giveaways of the
twelve days of vlogmas i hope guys have
enjoyed taking part in 12 days of
vlogmas thank you so much to everybody
who has already taken part and to win
this one I'm going to be doing a
Rafflecopter over on my blog so head
over to fashion Omnicom for all the
details and good luck just made myself a
nice red currant lemsip to try and help
my throat is not too bad but i doing it
to get any worse I thought I'd have a
little sip um just to hopefully nip it
in the bud my face mask is looking
pretty dry now Pat his eyebrow italy
hasn't dried i love how it you can
literally see the areas where it goes
into the pores
you know um yeah it's going to take that
off now i'm going to use my magnet own
you will have heels soon whoever wins
the competition but yeah i'm just gonna
use some hot water in the sink
and use this to take it off I find that
this just really helps to just really
vibrate the skin even more so it just
pulls any dirt out the skin so always
you have to take off any kind of face
mask with a magnet own and then I'll put
a cleanse with this afterwards as well
so then good pal good morning
so mask is off and now I'm going to use
magnitude again but with my Liz Earle
cleanse and polish partially to finish
cleansing my face but but also to clean
my magnet own because whenever I use a
clay mask it always ends up a little bit
grey so yeah hopefully the cleansing
brush will get rid of that okay so my
skin is looking and feeling very clean
after my little pump session my skin
it's just seriously like been buffed
within an inch of its life
I've double cleansed both times with the
magnet own so yeah feeling very smooth
now I'm going to put on an origins eye
cream this is the eye doctor I think
yeah I doctor which is really
moisturizing for the under eye area and
then I'm gonna put on this which is the
Wren instant firming beauty shot I
haven't used this in quite a while but I
remember it feels really nice on just
face masked skin and then after that
sunk in for a few moments I'm gonna put
on my most luxurious moisturizer which
is Charlotte Tilbury magic cream and let
that sink in for about 20 minutes before
I do anything else with my face okay so
I thought to make my life a bit easier
for the Christmas jumper haul I would
just leave my camera on a tripod and sit
down show you instead of you know
holding the camera so I have been buying
stuff from a stars and a couple of
boohoo orders as well and yeah I just
thought I would show you what I got
Christmas jumper wise because as I said
try not having Christmas jumper party
tomorrow and we want to look really
festive so
I'll start with ones which I've already
unwrapped this one actually you've
probably already seen me this was
actually sent to me by Dorothy Perkins
and it says express your elf and I
really like this one I might actually
put it on in a minute but yeah this is
from Dorothy Perkins really like that
one apparently Dorothy Perkins also have
one with a dachshund on it but it's a
blonde dachshund and not brown like my
little boys so probably not too too
right for me then I made a big a sauce
order I've already taken some of these
out of the box and put them on the
hanger firstly this one which is like a
cream net and it's got this kind of
embroidered Christmas tree on it I think
I actually maybe this one is my favorite
so far
but um yeah I just thought that was
really lovely embroidered it looks quite
Swedish it's got little Christmas trees
on the sleeves as well so I really like
that one and then also from a source
this is another lovely one this is just
cream kind of fealty material with gold
snowflakes this is probably the most
fashionable of all of them not sure how
I feel about the felt texture though
it's quite I don't know it feels a
little bit cheap not sure how this will
hang so I'm going to give that one a try
in a second this one actually looks like
a boy's Christmas jumper but it's more
of a very traditional kind of I'd call
this like a vintage skis style jumper so
you've got the fair isle print and the
reindeers it looks like a granddad
jumper I'm not sure that will suit me
first thought I'd get it just to give it
a go this one is really lovely you can
tell I've just got really crazy hard
solid loads of options I am gonna send
half of these back so let me know which
ones you guys like um yeah so this is
also quite traditional one soon as my
chuckles one like wore a couple of days
ago with just the detail around the
neckline but it's got little diamonds
don't want a on the top this is a sauce
own brand and a nice really thick knit
so that's a lovely one and I like the
high neckline on that as well
and then we have another quite
traditional one from a sauce this again
has got like the ski pattern on it so
really good one before actually taking
skiing
I'm not going skiing this winter at
least so far not that I'm aware of but
if I did have a ski load I planned I
definitely take this one it's got a
really high neck as well which I really
like I knew the lighting is going really
crazy but can't people just summon it
out just for just for this little
snippet um yeah I really like that one I
don't historically suit Navy that well
so we'll give that a go and then I have
a load from boohoo I have a his-and-hers
wrench on third so I'll just get out the
ladies version probably this one
so I thought I'd get me and Charlie
matching ones and I also wanted to get
much in one for Dexter as well yeah
so from boohoo I got a his-and-hers red
Farrell Christmas jumper also got one
for Dexter which I'll show you in a
minute those just as plain red with
little reindeer print on it and the boy
one is exactly the same it's quite a
high neck really snuggly and cozy I
think this is quite a nice traditional
one and this was really cheap I think it
was like around the 20-pound rocks it
was a good good value and nice and soft
as well I find sometimes if they're too
novelty they can be a little bit crispy
but this one feels really nice I really
like that one gives my lipstick um but
then so I wanted the dog jumper for this
in red in Navy but it was out of stock
but then when I checked cover these guys
in stock again the dog jumper so this is
for Dexter this is his little Navy
Farrell jumper which is just so cute he
already has his Christmas pudding one
which I thought you guys saw in a couple
of vlogs ago but yeah I just thought
that was absolute durable looks quite
small and he's getting to be a big boy
now but it's pretty stretchy so you try
him in that in a second
I got a few more from boohoo as well
just more of me to try this is a ring
like a more unique color this is more of
a burgundy really like the pattern on
this one you got the big snowflakes and
the reindeers quite traditional style
but I really like that one I think it's
quite slim fit as well as it could be
quite a flattering option and last but
not least I got a black one from booth
you don't have a black Christmas jumper
so it'd be nice to try and bring
something a little bit different in it's
a really similar print with the
snowflakes and the reindeer um and yeah
I thought that's quite a nice
traditional but um ya don't have a black
so I don't care so that's it for my
Christmas jumpers I'm afraid I don't
really have time to try them on to show
you because I have got so much work to
do today so I'm gonna get cracking with
my work and I think I'll probably vlog
again while I'm getting ready to go out
tonight for my surprise with my friends
Julia
okay so I've done my makeup and I used
the bare minerals candle light glow as I
said I was going to and I think it's
come out pretty well I really like the
base product which product product which
are used which is this one and it's
medium beige just a normal mineral
foundation but in this lovely little
gold box and I buff that in with a
buffing brush and then I used my normal
bronzer the hourglass a little bit of
this which is the bare minerals luminous
pink blush on the cheeks it didn't come
out that much though it wasn't terribly
strong so I put a little bit of
highlight on top and then on my eyelids
I used the little eyeshadow pot which
was in the set and this is their night
for mineral eyeshadow and as you can
this river and as you can see it's quite
a dark kind of purply Brown which I
really like it's got quite a nice amount
of shimmer in it as well then I put
false eyelashes on from the earlier set
and use the lash domination to kind of
set the two together I always use
mascara after my false lashes because I
find it just kind of binds the two
together and finally I used my Topshop
Motel lip crayon and I put
little bit off the bare minerals
marvelous Moxie buttercream lip gloss on
top and I have to say I haven't worn lip
gloss since I was probably about 13
years old but actually I think this is
quite pretty I am now all bundled up and
ready to go really hope that we are
doing what I think we're doing otherwise
I may have dressed very wrong for the
occasion
so come a little bubble hats on the one
which I got for my birthday and then
this lovely Oasis coat Topshop jumper
Oasis trousers and my old duo boots
my darling daddy
we
the Union China
