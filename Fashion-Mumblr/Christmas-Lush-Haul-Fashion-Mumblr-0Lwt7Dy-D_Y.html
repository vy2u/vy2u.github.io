joining me for today's video today is
going to be my first ever lush haul and
it's quite a good time of year I think
to really discover lush because they
have loads of really nice Christmas
things in at the moment noted by quite a
lot so I thought I would sit down and
show you guys it's all in a video so I
have been into large stores before I'm
never bored huge amount I'm not like a
major bath person all going now that
it's getting really wintry and cold
outside I definitely i'm going to having
a lot more bar so I thought I'd stock up
on loads of bad things and it's used to
be like really popular in the blocking
and YouTube area so I thought I really
need to get into lush and kind of learn
a little bit more about the products so
without further ado I'm going to go
through a few bits that i have bought
and try and talk a little bit around
them but um as I said I'm reshot them
that much before so I may not know too
much about the details I do know is that
they're very ecologically friendly is
that the world like no testing on
animals and they make sure they pay
their works a fair wage so it seems like
a really really lovely company and the
store itself i went into the oxford
street store i think it's a new flagship
and oh my gosh it's such a cool in-store
experience these staff also incredibly
helpful without being pushing they all
just wanted me so i have a good time
they wanted me to discover other
products and make sure i knew all about
their christmas things so it's really
really good in-store experience which
definitely made me pick up a few more
pieces and so this is little bag of
goodies I picks out when I went in most
recently to the Oxford Street store and
the first thing I've already pulled out
is the Snow Fairy shower gel so by the
looks fit I think all my sister is kind
of like run
bottom I think this is a sparkly shower
gel it says add a little sparkle to a
shower by cleansing when there's candy
floss sent it favorites so have a little
sniff of this to see if it actually yeah
it sounds incredibly sweet so definitely
one for people that loves sweet smells
it almost smells kind of bit like
tutti-frutti suites which I love I knew
my mom would absolutely hate this
because she doesn't really like anything
sweet or and very sickly I mean it's not
sickly but it's just definitely a really
really sweet once I think that would
make a really nice stocking filler and
beyond anything gonna enjoy using this
one I think I own a store upside down
for a bit cuz all the glitter has gone
to the bottom so just notice they have
little stickers on them and tell me who
it was made by so this project was made
by agar-agar hea and it's got her face
which is really really cute so I got
that and and then I wanted to get
something which I could give as a gift
so this is the Golden Wonder gifts at
Dexta had little shoe at the ribbon so
it's not as beautifully tied as it was
before it doesn't say what's inside and
I can't remember so this is just going
to be a surprise for whoever gets this
one but whatever it is it smells really
good I'm sure someone can leave in the
comments below if they know it's inside
for ya this is a surprise from lush and
then the rest of the pieces are mostly
in their little bag so I can tell you
what they are this is the magic of
Christmas wand and it's a bubble bar I
think by the sounds of it i can hear a
little bell tinkling this is going to be
the star yeah so this was actually the
product that made me start the ball
because i was really really excited to
pick up load more Christmasy things once
i saw there so this is the style bath
bomb what does it say cumberland
water magic of Christmas wand ooh it
smells really nice it's a kind of very
very cinnamony definitely our smell so
nice it definitely smells the most
presidency smelly we possibly describe
maybe some cove really really pretty and
it's sparkly and it's got I think that's
an anime is that what they're called
with some clothes are on the outside in
a little bell on the cinnamon stick so
this is really cute these things almost
like they're not cheap i think this was
probably at least three pounds for one
bath is quite expensive but i think it's
just the fact that it's so pretty and
cute criticism will make some really
really nice gift ideas or treats for
yourself next this one is a father
Christmas bath bomb and I remember
seeing these learn its hub by the door
and it just looks so cute hitfix still
intact see how we've got this really
cute pink it's very pink not red um oh
can you see it or not but no and hide it
from the lights hopefully you can see
it's got an like father Christmas's face
engraved my grade and kind of like
embossed on it which is really adorable
it smells really sweet again I'm not
sure what flavor is strawberry possibly
I don't know it doesn't save it smells
quite strawberryish very sweet again it
smells like lush stores like when you
walk past it smells like that pretty
cute this next one is the Holly
Golightly bubble bar another another
bath bomb and this one is super super
glittery so good I'm not wearing
anything too smart because it is
probably no put glitter all over the
place but I picked this one up because
it was so cute and sparkly and it looks
almost edible this definitely looks kind
of like a Mars you can print it smells
smells very oh good i'm not sure what
that smell as its really recognizable
it's very Christmasy
and then here's a hottie smell I don't
know it smells really good and I'm sure
it's going to make me very Sheree when I
put this on in the bar and I'm now
completely covered in glitter and then
finally and I remember this one is sorry
so pretty definitely prettiest of the
bunch and it is the snow angel bar mouse
which is really beautiful colors it's
like a gold on one side and white on the
other it's like an angel this smells
almost vanilla read something like
play-doh actually I like plasticine
which I absolutely love very accurate
with run windows this smells lovely
again so prettier always don't worry
using so beautiful but I will this whole
room is filling up with litter it's like
a little shower glitter coming from my
hands and then the last thing I got from
the store is the cranberry festive face
mask so I thought at this time of year
you eat so much rubbish or used I do and
maybe drink a little bit more alcohol
than I usually word which is none
basically and so thought it might be
nice and to add a little bit of
antioxidant goodness to my face so this
is the contrary festive face mask and it
says dress your face in antioxidant
cranberries and restorative organized
seriously it's smooth skin I think I
need to put this one in the fridge when
I finished showing uses all fresh
ingredients but it's really nice I'm
very heavily scented it smells like on
with your cranberries but do you know
this really fancies skincare and I think
it's called ela they have a really they
have a really recognizable centum fees
and smell like that which I absolutely
love they have allure skincare and body
wash at cycle on Water Street and I
always love the smell of those so this
really reminds me of that
I think I might even treat myself to
using that one later and the other thing
which I wanted to show you in this hall
which technically is kind of cheating
because I was actually given this by
lash out there I think it's the store
opening or no wasn't stroking that was
ages ago it was the head Christmas party
they did their Christmas and launch and
I was really highly given this ginormous
box of Christmas eat goodness I thought
I'd open it up with you now and show you
guys what is inside it's such an
incredible gift idea i think i'd go
crazy someone bought with minors so
wonderful it did have a big pink bow on
it but i took them off one i first got
it and i showed you guys first
impressions on snapchat and dexter
besides shred it so yeah the bow is no
more but inside you can see there's
loads and loads of bits and bobs we've
got bath bombs Jays lip scrubs face
masks so many lovely pieces that was
also loads and loads of quad starring
bits in it which I've taken out because
they were just so messy as I said
because I'm not a lush pro I'm not knew
how to tell you like what all these
things are I can show you and you can it
talk about them so first is this really
swirly bath bottom at least I'm hoping
it's worth one I did try using one of
these things at the bathroom before I
didn't work so actually I think it was a
am body wash bar so i'm thinking is the
bath bomb I smells great tutti frutti
kind of raspberries tried to say so
maybe it's like a raspberry swirl or
something and then this doesn't even
look like a real thing it looks like a
unicorn pool or something it's really
really cute it's like a pink and white
swirly dome again got that really same
similar to the Snow Fairy actually maybe
it's like a Snow Fairy dome that kind of
candy floss you smell then there is a
black bar soap with a little reindeer on
it so this is the Rudolph so cool oh
that smells amazing
oh my gosh I wish I was better at
describing sentencings this is really
incredible smell is quite a manly smell
as well almost quite musky so some quite
nice one to stick in the boyfriend
stocking I think there's a miniature of
Snow Fairy shower gel which again really
really nice for putting in your quarters
is really thick very can be flossing
really nice putting your overnight bag
or maybe there's a stocking filler and
then this I'm really excited to try this
is the Santa's lip scrub for some
festive pushing for mistletoe ready
pouts I did have the bubble gum lip
scrub quite a while ago and absolutely
loved it and you find it a little bit on
hygienic that you're scrubbing away the
dead saline your lips and then like
licking it off because these really do
taste amazing but it's really good
especially for chapped lips during this
time of year so I definitely be using
that one quite frequently before bed and
then slobbering on some lip balm is a
very cool white bath bomb again at least
hoping is above bomb this is slightly
less sickly than the previous ones it's
more more like a muted sweet smell and
things would be better for like older
sisters or moms maybe again we really
lovely smart very it's very perfume to
actually smells like laughing like it's
really
very floral smell my hands getting so
covered in stuff right now this is the
Rose argan body conditioner so it says
it's got argan oil cocoa butter caprica
butter Brazil nut oil olive oil and shea
butter so this looks sounds absolutely
lovely oh my god that smells heavenly oh
my gosh I think those honestly the
nicest thing I have ever smelt house so
lovely I'm going to put that aside and
put that on after my bath this evening
oh this is a cute one this is one for
guys oh maybe it's not provides me of
its girls legs but it's a shaving
smoothie we frost up this smoothie with
a coffee and lavender infusion kaolin to
gently cleanse and extra virgin olive
oil to condition the skin okay i'm
thinking it's mainly for girls to shave
their legs mmm it smells quite new when
you put like stuff on your skin if you
have bad skin that's quite witch hazel
maybe I don't know class really nice I
guess it's good for like drawing any
impurities out the skin or calm in the
skin when you are shaving but that
smells divine and this one over playing
with us in the store this is Santa's
belly shower jelly which is so so fun
it's basically this little pot thing is
Rosberg oh no that's not like cherry
cherry juice oh go for the fresh apple
juice and fruity vegan wine that's funny
I definitely what I've said that was
like black crown or cherry but either
way it's a jelly as you would guess by
the name and I'm not sure I think it's
one of these oh my gosh okay I really
should have got like a tissue or
something to wipe my hands with because
I don't really want to get this all over
my clothing I'm intrigued to see how
this will work in the shower I mean do I
just like scoop it out and wash my body
with it does it fall back flat or does
it just turn out like jelly and sit I'm
really rumbling but yeah I'm really
intrigued to see how this will how this
will work in shower I look like I've cut
myself it's going to bite us my leggings
then we've got a bath bomb which looks a
little bit like a disco ball with a
little Polly stuck in the top so this is
0 again quite like a musky scent I've
always want to be really sweet and crazy
but actually it's really quite a subdued
sent really nice and then these are
called oral pleasure tantric toothy tabs
oh my gosh come slowly mouth lips and
used to the mingle among naughty
passionfruit an aphrodisiac Electric
daisies that's rather naughty it says
nibble one they're big enough between
the teeth and start brushing so I mean
are they mints or they for brushing your
teeth I literally have no idea what what
this is for let's try one
oh my god it tastes like I'm just eating
a bath bomb that's really weird I hope
they were actually edible yeah it
definitely says nibble one very strange
next I have something very festive and
these are the five gold rings are pretty
sure these are all bath bombs hopefully
they are some planning on using them as
bath bombs tonight be pretty gold
glitter so hope either make the bars and
nice and sparkly and then this is a
little mini of the Rose jam shower gel
I'm sure I've heard people talking about
this before and quite hyped up in the
game of blogging and usually well smells
absolutely incredible yeah that smells
really nice i can see what people are
and hyping this up for but looking
forward to giving that when i try and
think i'll use this as my body wash
tonight this is such good fun it's like
a pink flamingo both bar- stick which is
really really good fun I think I'll pray
about this nut and give us a non
stocking Phillips somebody it's too nice
to use it's like I don't want just me to
be able to experience the fun of this
definitely one for sharing and finally
from the box I have got this cream bar
of soap at least I think it's a bar of
soap with little pink flower in it
smells quite vanilla we are still quite
it still quite floor at the same time
okay to forge a smoker business for
describing things but yeah this is I'm
guessing it's just a little bar so it
feels quite chocolatey maybe since you
like it no not edible but yeah this is a
really lovely scented farm soup be
another really beautifully scented
product from lush which is actually
melting all over my hands
Messi's video i filmed in it quite some
time so it's better say that I have got
plenty of lovely treats for the next
month or so it's bath time there's so
many lovely things that they're always
too nice to use I don't know how you
guys recommend using energy saving up
for special occasions or do you just
always give them as gifts I guess
they're just such lovely things to
receive as I said they're not cheap so
it's quite a treat for yourself or
lovely lil stocking filler I mean this
is definitely not stocking filler this
is like a main present but such a good
thing to buy someone who loves pampering
and I think there are people out there
that are just absolutely crazy flush
like the lush alcoholics whatever you
want to call them but yeah it's been
really fun to discover more about the
friend i'm looking forward to actually
trying them i have tried a few bits
about before but i'm really looking
forward to digging into all my new
purchases and treats and yeah
discovering it more about both products
