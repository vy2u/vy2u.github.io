joining me for today's video today is
going to be my first ever lush haul and
it's quite a good time of year I think
to really discover lush because they
have loads of really really nice
Christmas things in at the moment and I
did buy quite a lot so I thought I'd sit
down and show you guys it's all in a
video so I have been into large stores
before I've never bought a huge amount
I'm not like a major bath person
although now that it's getting really
wintry and cold outside I definitely
think I'm going to having a lot more
bath so I thought I'd stock up on loads
of bath things and it seems to be like
really popular in the blocking and
YouTube area so I thought I really need
to get into lush and kind of learn a
little bit more about the products so
without further ado I'm going to go
through a few the bits that I have
bought and try and talk a little bit
around them but um as I said however you
shot them that much before so I may not
know too much about the details I do
know is that they're very ecologically
friendly is that the word like no
testing on animals and they make sure
they pay their works a fair wage so it
seems like a really really lovely
company and the store itself I went into
the Oxford Street store I think it's
their new flagship and oh my gosh it's
such a cool in-store experience these
stuff also incredibly helpful without
being pushing they all just wanted me so
I have a good time they wanted me to
discover other products and make sure I
knew all about their Christmas things so
there's a really really good in-store
experience which definitely made me pick
up a few more pieces and so this is the
little bag of goodies I picked up when I
went in the most recently to the Oxford
Street store and the first thing I've
already pulled out is the Snow Fairy
shower gel so by the looks fit I think
all my pets are kind of like run
bottom I think this is a sparkly shower
gel that says and a little sparkle to a
shower by posing when there's candy
floss scented favorites so I'm gonna
have a little sniff of this to see if it
actually yes sounds incredibly sweet so
definitely one for people that loves
sweet smells it almost smells kind of
bit like a tutti fruity sweets which I
love I knew my mom would absolutely hate
this because she doesn't really like
anything sweet or very sickly it mean
it's not sickly but it's just definitely
a really really sweet once I think that
would make a really nice stocking filler
and beyond anything gonna enjoy using
this one I think I own a store upside
down for a bit because all the glitter
has gone to the bottom so just notice
they have little stickers on them tell
me who it was made by so this approach
was made by agar agar HEA and it's got
her face which is really really cute so
I got that um and then I wanted to get
something which I could give as a gift
so this is the Golden Wonder gifts at
texture hello shoo at the ribbons so
it's not as beautifully tied as it was
before
who doesn't say what's inside and I
can't remember so this is just gonna be
a surprise for whoever gets this one but
whatever it is it smells really good
I'm sure someone can leave in the
comments below if they know it's inside
but yeah this is a surprise from lush
and then the rest of the pieces are
mostly indelible bags so I can tell you
what they are this is the magic of
Christmas wand and it's the bubble bar I
think by the sounds of it I can hear a
little foul jingling this is going to be
the star yeah so this was actually the
product that made me start the whole
because I was really really excited to
pick upload more Christmassy things once
I saw there so this is the star bath
bomb what is it saying
Cumberland water magic of Christmas wand
ooh it smells really nice it's a kind of
very very cinnamony definitely oh it
smells so nice it definitely smells the
most prison see smelly could possibly
describe maybe some Cove really really
pretty and it's sparkly and it's got I
think that's just an anime is that what
they're called with some quotes on the
outside and a little bell on the
cinnamon stick so this is really cute
these things are almost like they're not
cheap I think this was probably at least
three pounds for one bath it's quite
expensive but I think it's just the fact
that it's so pretty and cute criticism
will make some really really nice gift
ideas or treats for yourself next this
one is a father Christmas bath bomb and
I remember seeing these luna table by
the door this looks so cute it's still
intact see how we've got this really
cute pink it's very pink and not red um
oh can you see it or not
no and hide it from the lights hopefully
you can see it's got like father
Christmas's face engraved engraved and
kind of like embossed on it which is
really adorable it smells really sweet
again I'm not sure what flavor it is
strawberry possibly I don't know it
doesn't say that it smells quite
strawberryish very sweet again
it smells like lush stores like when you
walk past it smells like that pretty
cute this next one is the Holly
Golightly bubble bath this one is super
super glittery so if you're not wearing
anything too smart because this is
probably a no put glitter all over the
place but I picked this or not because
it was so cute and sparkly and it looks
almost edible this definitely looks kind
of like a Mars you can trim it smells
smells very oh good I'm not sure what
that smell as it's really recognizable
it's very Christmassy
I don't think it's a haughty smell I
don't know it smells really good and I'm
sure it's gonna make me very Sheree when
I put this on in the bar and I'm now
completely covered in pizza and then
finally and I remember this one is sorry
so pretty definitely prettiest of the
bunch and it is these snow angel Bart
melts which is really beautiful colors
it's like they're gold on one side and
white on the other it's just like an
angel
this smells almost vanilla eat something
like play-doh actually or like
plasticine which I have seen loved very
oh boy rot - this smells lovely again
it's so pretty I always don't use X is
so beautiful but I will this whole room
is filling up with blister it's like a
little shower of glitter coming from my
hands and then the last thing I got from
the store is the cranberry festival face
mask so I thought at this time of year
you eat so much rubbish or at least I do
and maybe you drink a little bit more
alcohol them and usually word which is
none basically and so thought it might
be nice and to add a little bit of
antioxidant goodness to my face so this
is the contrary festive face mask and it
says dress your face in antioxidants
cranberries and restorative organizer
seriously it's smooth that's skin
I think I need to put this one in the
fridge when I finished showing uses all
fresh ingredients but it's really nice
I'm very heavily scented it smells like
on with you cranberries but do you know
this really fancy skincare and I think
it's called ela they have a really they
have a really recognizable scent on
these smell like that which I absolutely
love they have allure skin care and body
wash at cycle on Water Street and I
always love the smell of those so this
really reminds me of that I think I
might even treat myself to using that
one later and the other thing which I
wanted to show you in this hall which
technically is kind of cheating because
I was actually given this by lush out
there I think it's this is store opening
or no wasn't a store thing that was ages
ago it was the head Christmas party they
did their Christmas launch and I was
really finally given this ginormous box
of Christmasy goodness I thought I'd
open it up with you now and show you
guys what is inside it's such an
incredible gift idea I think I've got
crazy someone promise - so wonderful it
did have a big pink bow on it but I took
it off one I first got it and I showed
you guys first impressions on snapchat
and Dexter decided to shred it so yeah
the bow is no more but inside you can
see there's loads and loads of bits and
bobs
we've got bath bombs jellies lip scrubs
face masks so many lovely pieces
there was also loads and those across
starring bits in it which I've taken out
because they were just so messy as I
said because I'm not a lush Pro I've not
knew how to tell you like what all these
things are but I can show you and you
can talk about them so first is this
really swirly bath bottom at least I'm
hoping it's worth one I did tried using
one of these things at the bus problem
before and it didn't work so actually I
think it was a am body wash bar so I'm
thinking this is a bath bomb I smells
very tutti fruity kind of raspberries
I'd say so maybe it's like a raspberry
swirl or some things and then this
doesn't even look like a real thing it
looks like a unicorn or something it's
really really cute it's like a pink and
white
swirly dome again you've got that really
same similar to the Snow Fairy actually
maybe it's like a Snow Fairy dome that
kind of candy floss you smell then there
is a black bar soap with a little
reindeer on it so this is the Rudolph so
cool oh that smells amazing
oh my gosh I wish I was better at
describing sentences this is really
incredible smell is quite a manly smell
as well almost quite musky so some quite
nice one to sink in the boyfriend
stopping I think there's a miniature of
Snow Fairy shower gel which again really
really nice for putting in Europe oh
this is really thick very can be fussy
pretty nice but you know overnight bag
or maybe these are stocking filler and
then this I'm really excited to try this
is the Santa's lip scrub festive pushing
for mistletoe ready Palace I did have
the bubble gum lip scrub quite a while
ago and absolutely loved it do you find
it a little bit unhygenic that you're
scrubbing away the dead seal in your
lips and then like licking it off
because these really do taste amazing
but it's really good especially for
chapped lips during this time of year so
I definitely be using that one quite
frequently before bed and then slapping
on some lip balm is a very pure white
sperm bath balm again at least hoping
it's a bath balm this is slightly less
sickly than the previous ones it's more
more like a muted sweet smell I think
it'll be better for like older sisters
or moms maybe again really really lovely
smell very it's very perfume to actually
smells like a perfume like it's really a
very floral smell my hands getting so
covered in stuff right now this is the
Rose Argan body conditioner so it says
it's got argan oil cocoa butter
kakuka butter Brazil nut oil olive oil
and sheer butter
so this looks sounds absolutely lovely
oh my god that smells heavenly
I think those honestly the nicest thing
I have ever smelt has so lovely I'm
going to put that aside and put that on
after my bath this evening oh this is a
cute one this is one for guys oh maybe
it's not providing me of it's for girls
legs but it's a shaving smoothie
we frosted up this smoothie with a
coffee and lavender infusion kaolin to
gently cleanse and extra virgin olive
oil to condition the skin okay I'm
thinking it's maybe for girls to shave
their legs mm-hmm it smells quite new
when you put like stuff on your skin if
you have bud skin that's quite witch
hazel ooh maybe I don't know supposed to
be nice I guess is good for like drawing
any impurities out the skin or calming
the skin when you are shaving but that
smells divine
then this one over were playing with
this in the store this is Santa's belly
shower jelly which is so so fun it's
basically this little pot think it's a
raspberry oh no that's not like cherry
cherry juice for the fresh apple juice
and the fruity vegan wine that's funny I
definitely would have said that was like
black roan or cherry but either way it's
a jelly as you would guess by the name
and I'm not sure I think it's one of
these oh my gosh okay
everybody should have got like a tissue
or something to wipe my hands with
because I don't really want to get this
all over my clothing but I'm intrigued
to see how this will work in the shower
I mean do I just like to scoop it out
and wash my body with it does it fall
back flat or does it just turn out like
jelly and sit I'm rambling but yeah I'm
really intrigued to see how this will
how this will work in the shower and
look like I've cut myself
it's gonna bite us my leggings then
we've got a bath bomb which looks a
little bit like a disco ball with a
little Polly's stuck in the top so this
is ooh I've gotten quite like a musky
scent I thought this wouldn't be really
sweet and crazy but actually it's really
quite a subdued scent really nice and
then these are called oral pleasure
tantric teeth e-tabs oh my gosh come
slowly mouth lips unused to the mingle
among naughty passion fruit and
aphrodisiac electric daisies
that's rather naughty it says nibble one
they're big enough between the teeth and
start brushing so I mean are they mints
or are they for brushing your teeth I
literally have no idea what what this is
for let's try one
Oh oh my god it tastes like I'm just
eating a bath bomb that's really weird
I hope they were actually edible yeah it
definitely says nipple one very strange
next I have something very festive and
these are the five gold rings are pretty
sure these are all bath bombs hopefully
they are some funny one using them as
bath bombs tonight be pretty gold
glitter so hopefully they make the bars
nice and sparkly and then this is a
little mini of the Rose charm shower gel
I'm sure I've heard people talking about
this one before learning quite hyped up
in the game of blogging and usual well
smells absolutely incredible yeah that's
not really nice I can see what people
are and hyping this up for but looking
forward to giving that when I try and
think I'll use this as my body wash
tonight this is such good fun it's like
a pink flamingo bath bomb on a stick
which is really really good fun I think
I'll pray about this Matt and give us a
little stocking Phillips somebody it's
too nice to use it's like I don't want
just me to be able to experience the fun
of this definitely one for sharing and
finally from the box I have got this
cream bar of soap at least I think it's
a bar of soap with little pink flower in
it it smells quite the dinner II I still
quite it's still quite floral at the
same time okay too funky smell
revisionist for describing things but
yeah this is I'm guessing it's just a
normal bar so it feels quite chocolatey
maybe isn't like it no not edible but
yeah this is the lovely scented barn
soup via another really beautifully
scented products from lush which is
actually melting all over my hands this
is definitely the messiest video I have
filmed in it quite some time so it's
fair to say that I have got plenty of
lovely treats for the next month or so
it's bath time there's so many lovely
things that they're always too nice to
use
don't know how you guys recommend using
unity segment for special occasions or
do you just always give them as gifts I
guess they're just such lovely things to
receive as I said they're not cheap so
it's quite a treat for yourself or
lovely little stocking filler I mean
this is definitely what's filler
this is like a main presence but such a
good thing to buy someone who loves
pampering and I think there are people
out there that are just absolutely crazy
flush like melash Pollux whatever you
want to call them but yeah it's been
really fun to discover more about the
frames I'm looking forward to actually
trying them I have tried a few bits and
bobs before but I'm really looking
forward to digging into all my new
purchases and treats and yeah
discovering more about other products so
