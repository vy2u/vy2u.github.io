getting ready for my first festive party
of the year keeping it classic I'm
opting to wear a chic and timeless
little black dress so what better time
to share with you my black and white
style essentials for the party season
ahead and let you get ready with me
alright so what goes perfectly with a
little black dress but an elegant cape a
statement bag this beauty is my new
favorite and my favorite shoes because
no party look is complete without them
finally my secret weapon sure invisible
black and white to protect me and my
clothes and to keep my black dress and
looking its absolute best so let's start
to get ready I like to refresh my skin
with a sheet mask before makeup
application to hydrate my skin and bring
back the glow I'll leave it on for about
15 minutes and then massage any excess
into my skin while the serum sinks in
let me tell you why the short invisible
is such a party season essential I want
to feel confident and look great in my
LBD and with this I know I don't need to
worry about white marks yellow stains or
sweat so that means more dancing and
more more party okay first on my skin is
my serum ran perfect canvas is a really
great base for a long-lasting finish
then my favorite foundation bare
minerals bare Pro for beautiful coverage
and it's actually good for your skin too
I apply with a Beauty Blender for a
flawless finish I don't want the
foundation to dry out my lips and
prepare them for lipstick later on I
apply a lip balm this one from Lamar is
totally luxurious next I'll attempt to
lessen my under eye shadows using bare
minerals bare skin is a serum concealer
so I find it beautifully hydrating I
it's on and blend with a beauty blender
I set all that base down with my bare
minerals powder so it doesn't budge
throughout the night next let's bring
back the color and shape to my face with
a la Mer bronzer I just love the
sunkissed glow this gives my skin it's
so very luxurious you can probably guess
but I like to use all my favourite
products when getting ready for a
festive party time to sort out those
brows and I'm using the Ilia precision
brow pencil i mark out the three points
of the brow shape and fill in any gaps
it's the waxy crayon so very
long-lasting - moving on to eyeshadow
I'm starting with the most neutral shade
from this Bobbi Brown palette and
applying all over the lid to create a
base oops forgot brow gel apply that
next and then a more sparkly shade from
the Bobbi Brown palette this beautiful
gold for the lids and then the stunning
sparkly bronze to add depth to the
crease blend blend blend
then snapping getting ready is hungry
work using my favorite palette I add a
subtle highlight for some of the
hourglass ambient light powders and a
very light swipe of blush shades for
some delicate color to the cheeks
let's add some more drama to the eyes
using our Lonnie's eyeliner a quick mist
to set this all down and hydrate the
skin and I've decided I want an even
more intense look on the eyes so it's
time to bring out the big guns this
eyeliner from the Bhutan Beauty more
snacks have popcorn this time let's move
on to lips this bareMinerals lip liner
is the perfect color and so soft on the
lips and then using an hourglass nude
lipstick yes nude because just because
it's the festive season it doesn't mean
I'm going to totally disregard my
signature shade now it's time to apply
my sure invisible black and white
whether it's my white silk pajama top or
my favourite black jumper it keeps my
black and white festive wardrobe looking
its best
back into the boudoir and it's on with
my LBD look no white marks
I apply my favorite set of eyelashes and
then it's time to curl my hair using my
usual technique with my ghd's oh that
doesn't look very good that's a bit
better why do I still find hair curling
so hard let's move on I pop on my
favourite party shoes give the room a
quick tidy up and then I spritz my hair
with this Tom Ford hair mist and do a
little bit of fragrance combining by
spritzing myself with by Killians women
in gold perfume
it's time to go I pop on my cape
ultra chic all in black and a quick
check of my reflection
I grabbed my bag and the look is
complete here is the full outfit of the
evening sheep but festive and totally
timeless
tick tock let's get out of here it's
time to party</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
