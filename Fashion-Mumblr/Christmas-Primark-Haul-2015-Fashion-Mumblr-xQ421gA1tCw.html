Primark haul Dexter and I are very
excited to show you all of the festive
pieces that I have been buying recently
I actually in my head thought this is
gonna be quite a small hole by have two
quite big bags to get through so
hopefully not gonna be so small after
all
so the Primark that I went to on
Tottenham Court Road just as soon as I
walked in there was so many Christmas
things everywhere from pajamas and
jumpers to decorations and home things
so I had a really good go in there I
didn't buy a crazy amount but I feel
like the stuff that I bought is really
nice things not like too tacky or
anything I just got some really lovely
bits if I do say so myself so let's get
started the first thing that I spotted
and the thing that actually made me want
to go a little bit crazy in there are
these absolutely gorgeous little
leggings with gingerbread men and kind
of candy cane hearts on them okay no
thanks just trying to get in the bag
they are a super-duper soft fleecy
material is the kind of material that
you just want to snuggle up with really
SuperDuper soft and incredibly stretchy
as well so I think they're gonna be a
really nice fit they were only ten
pounds so I'm hoping they're not gonna
go too saggy around the bottom after the
first wear but even if they do you only
wear this kind of stuff like in the two
weeks around Christmas anyway so I'm
just gonna wear these to death and hope
that they survive I wear comfy trousers
at home like all the time ducks don't
know yeah I work on beach houses at home
all the time even now I've just got a
jumper on a Christmas jumper whoo boob
shot and and comfy trousers Exhibit A so
yeah I think no they don't see you
cheeky monkey so I think I'll be wearing
these quite a lot over the next coming
few weeks of pretty weather on Christmas
Day might even wear them as pajamas when
I stay at Mom's house it can be
chill it there so yeah us that you love
these ten pounds they did have loads of
different kinds they had great ones with
like reindeers and snowflakes are quite
fair I'll print they had red ones with
snowflakes and I got remember there were
loads of different designs so definitely
go and check them out the size six which
I wear was super duper hard to find this
one was actually on the floor at the
back the legs are dust all over it um so
I'm gonna give it a good old wash before
I wear these but yeah love these two
pieces and cannot wait to start wearing
them I know I just feel SuperDuper
festive when I pop them on x2 the
leggings there were a load of Christmas
jumpers I decided to get this one it's
still got the size tag on it
let's stick that favorite bear so this
is a topi kind of jumper I have quite a
few great Christmas jumpers including
this one which is kind of great pink one
but yeah this is a taupe color which is
a little bit unusual and it has Al's and
candy canes on it well the Owls are kind
of perching on the candy canes and
they've got little fairy tummies which
is just adorable I thought it's just
quite a simple Christmas jumper than
nothing too crazy and very wearable so
definitely wearing this one out the
house it was 14 pounds so nothing too
crazy the materials nice and soft as
well so really chuffed with that one
there were loads of Christmas jumpers
they had novelty ones like flashing
light ones I may go back and get Charlie
flashing light one just to see if he
will dare to wear it but yeah I just got
that one for now actually I did get
another Christmas jumper this one is
going to be a gift for which Holly's
little sister because she's very cool
like she's 18 19 but yeah she's she is
always like speaking to me in emojis I
thought this was really good one for her
it's got the cheeky monkey emojis
wearing Santa hats this one
but 14 pounds again gray really classic
and it's a fabulous big slouchy kind of
fit so I think this is right at her
streets and just going to give that to
her as not stopping for that on
Christmas Day so hopefully she likes
that name which is not watching and
Charlie and I are going to be having a
Christmas drum party next weekend we're
going to get a load of friends and
family over
actually no family just friends we're
gonna have a load of friends over and
you have to wear a Christmas jumper
that's mandatory we're going to make
mulled wine got the tree and everything
Dexter's gonna be wearing his Christmas
jumper which I'll show you later cause
he's sleeping and you know let the
sleeping dog lie because otherwise
you're just play havoc but yeah so for a
Christmas jumper party I thought it'd be
fun to just get everybody some novelty
headbands so I did stock up on a few
from Primark because they were so cheap
so I got Hugh and this pair which I
think of my favorites absolutely love
these were three pounds they are little
reindeer antlers with gorgeous little
bells on them I just think they're so
cute I just want to wear these like I
wish I was acceptable to wear out in
public because I genuinely I think they
look so cute so but these I might just
leave them on draw some video because
it's Christmas why not then I got this
Christmas tree which i think is just
gonna look so silly whoever wears this
again three pounds it says light up okay
so it lights up good yeah yeah so if the
little light-up um star at the top and a
little fluffy edge around it yeah three
pounds I just think her
Everywhere's it's gonna look really
stupid but that's what Christmas jumper
parties are all about and then a very
chic if I do say so myself
sparkly father Christmas hat to gain oh
this was 2 pounds this one was a bit of
a bargain I'm sure this one was 3 pounds
I took the label off because Dexter was
cheering it I don't know where it is but
yeah I'm pretty sure this one was 3
pounds
this one's 2 pounds just a Christmas hat
with a little Holly bit on it that so
yeah that one's gonna look quite cute as
well
in the home section I grabbed some
napkins
game for our Christmas party twenty
napkins for a pound pretty darn good
they've got stars on them and they're
just white with stars on pretty pretty
simple you know not too offensive on
good value so yeah got got though it's
got two sets of those so about forty
napkins pretty sort of the napkins and
then under the big bag
it's actually not that many things in
here but loads of one particular thing
which I will get to I picked up some
plastic champagne flutes so you've got
four champagne flutes in here and this
was one pound fifty that is so good one
pound fifty four for champagne flutes
they are plastic with a kind of pewter
plastic pewter bit on the top and a
pewter kind of colored base so they'll
be really lovely for serving drinks top
party I I got two sets of those so we
have eight plastic champagne flutes in
total 83 pounds I mean it's such a good
value if you guys having Christmas
parties and definitely go and stock up
on Primark bits if you watched my last
Primark haul which I think I filmed in
kind of end of October early November
they already had some festive table ware
then and I got a lovely wreath like a
pine cone Gold sparkly wreath um which i
think is centered karim if it was
centered or not I also got loads of
paper cups and paper plates so I haven't
used those yet they're still like in
there um in there plastic wrap so going
to check that pull out from the seat of
a paper crockery that I got if that's
your thing also got some super soft
socks not sure whether I'm gonna keep
these or when I'm going to give them as
another stocking filler they're really
lovely as you would guess by the name
they are incredibly soft just the kind
of thing that you want to put in like
ways or in osg pose gosh let's go to
purse for 2050 yeah these are the kind
of socks that just feel really sumptuous
on your feet they just they don't even
feel like actual material because
they're so soft so really love those
they had loads of different patterns
I've got the white and pale blue with
snowflakes again kind of fair isle print
but they had so many different designs I
think I might go back and stock up on
these because 2.50 of two pairs I just
think everybody would love to receive
some of these in their stockings in here
we have a candle holder this is this was
an absolute bargain I know
uh-huh oh you know about that this is
five pounds I think I thought this was
cheaper I thought this was two pound but
anyway I picked this up a little handle
and I just think it's a lovely design
for putting a maybe a pillar candle I
think the tea light might get quite lost
in there may be a pillar candle on the
dining table or maybe on a fireplace we
don't really like to light our fire
because of Dexter so we just put loads
of candles around that instead and he
doesn't really like candles so doesn't
go to near them but I thought this would
look nice with a load of others some
candle holders and I'm sure for a couple
of small ones but maybe I took them out
already um but yeah I think just
creating a real cluster of candles
either on your table or on your
fireplace looks really lovely and
festive and if you don't have a
fireplace and it just creates a lovely
warm and comforting feature so I grabbed
this one and a few more but yeah before
you put those in the houses sorry can't
show you those and lastly and this is a
little bit um excessive but I'm not
actually that festive so sorry I got
loads and I mean loads of copper coat
hangers so this excited me far more than
it should have done basically I really
want to kind of give my wardrobe a bit
of a spruce up I'm definitely gonna do
like a new year new wardrobe although
just making my existing clothes look
better by putting them all on cup of
coat hangers so at the moment my clothes
are on a top ship ones I donated like I
just an old coat hanger those wooden
ones velvet ones plastic ones didn't FY
ones that you get from the dry cleaner
so I thought I would replace all of my
coat hangers with copper ones I saw
these on a Spanish brothers Instagram
quite a long time ago and she was like
just bought all of the Barcelona stores
and Primark coat hangers copper coat
hangers I was like I really want to
get them so I ran to the Tottenham Court
Road when they didn't have them and
stopped me nothing about them so I was
very disheartened but then I came back
and just happened to see them out the
corner of my eye and yeah I thought
quite a lot like seriously there is a
whole bag full of copper coat hangers so
ya went a little bit crazy but they're
quite festive cause I thought I'd stick
them in this hall because all I'm really
looking forward to sprucing my wardrobe
up with my lovely new copper coat
hangers that's going to be strangely
satisfying switching all of those over
so yeah not the world's biggest haul but
I'm sure you'll agree I've got some
really cute pieces in there lots of
lovely festive things in Primark at the
moment I'm sure I'm probably gonna end
up going in there again and picking up
more stuff they have wrapping paper but
I do not need any more wrapping paper I
bought loads in the sale last exam race
didn't you like that but ya got some
really cute pieces and I'm gonna go and
try these on how because they are so
cute and so fluffy so thank you guys for

pieces with me please
