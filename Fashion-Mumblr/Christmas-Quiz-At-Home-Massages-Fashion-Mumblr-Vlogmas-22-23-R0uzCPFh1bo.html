Monday morning and I'm in a very
productive mood although I am still in
my pajamas and I haven't done my hair or
makeup but you know you can be
productive in your pajamas got my coffee
my nice benefit milk which Charlie has
not finished this morning in the slurp
this and with my coffee I had the
coolest biscuit in the whole world let
me show you this
it's from biscuit ears but it was sent
to me from magnet own and it actually
looks like one of their pending devices
which I'm going to enjoy the bearing now
I've got about a billion and two emails
to get through and a really long to-do
list I woke up smiling I was like right
I need to write to do less because that
just makes me so you could productive if
I can take things off my list and I also
need to film a video about my oven for a
Oh calm so that's going to be fun and
interesting and yeah a lot more present
wrapping I'm hoping Charlie's going to
go out soon so I can wrap his presents
because they're so big a commune dirt
subtly so yeah productive me this
morning actually first step is to tackle
magnet own cookie it's got a sound does
that yummy just taking my hair out of a
French plat and now it's just this
massive really um sight thing I'm just
gonna ignore the Hat and see I'm not in
bed now Oh finally it's 12 o'clock but
it feels so much later it feels like 5
o'clock because I'm not going to show
you outside cuz it's gray and it's
raining pouring the old man is snoring
um yeah so I thought I quickly showed
you some of the lovely pieces that I
opened up last night because there are
some my gosh I just got my eyebrows like
all the top of the screen I got a
monobrow I digress yeah I thought I'd
show you quickly some of the pieces I
opened up last night cuz I got some
really nice bits and bobs
and I got this chocolate bar from
L'Occitane which has got my name on it
which is really really cute I'm hoping
it's gonna be like milk chocolate yeah
nagoba lots of love from the locks of
tongue PR team and that came with a snow
globe which is just absolutely adorable
I don't think I even own a snow globe so
that's nice and then this beautiful box
which had or has a LOX tank earring in
it so we've got little bunch of lavender
um a ballerina and one of their hand
cream so I'm going to put this on my
house keys now because I think the house
key keychain that how the moment is from
a cracker from last year so it's that
time I had a bit of an update what else
we got I got a cracker from Oscar which
has got their cleansing gel in it which
I love so I'm going to crack this
shortly and have an old pamper um and
then this company called photo box got
in touch and they're like oh we're gonna
send you some some gifts nothing okay
don't know what you're gonna send but go
for it and they've sent me this cushion
which has basically got like a montage
of Dexter's Instagram photos on it which
is so adorable you guys need to follow
Dexter if you don't already he's
smashing it he's got like 6,000
followers on Instagram leave his
username here yeah this is really really
cute and everybody loved him and then
Schwarzkopf I suddenly couldn't make
their dinner and because I was having a
family evening but they've sent me a
personalized stocking this is Josie on
it which is there's my name so yeah they
sent a lovely gray stocking it's filled
with lots of goodies which I will show
you so we have got the made for most
texturizing putty which I haven't
actually tried before and I always think
party's better on short hair but I'll
give it a go texturizing hairspray this
is probably gonna be better for me so
Dexter's naughty not the pajamas no
Mickey yeah so give this a try later on
and then we've got the playful or
styling primer primer seem to have been
the thing this year it get the roller
what's it say depending on hair length
and partied six pumps pumps on damp or
dry hair
is that good and a sculpting spritz I
don't usually do much with my hair as
you can see leave it oh natural but yeah
I need to have a little play around with
those and see you what they like
now I'm gonna wrap Choi's present this
is in the gym at the moment but he's
going back in a second and it's quite
big so I can't really do it subtly so
we're gonna take this downstairs Charlie
if you're watching my darling
okay this is my wrapping station I was
doing a few prozis this morning so
hopefully oh no crap okay gonna have to
go into the loft and get some more paper
damn
okay Prezi successfully wrapped I'm now
debating whether I have time to cook and
eat and macaroni cheese Dexter cheering
so now debating whether I have time to
cook and eat a macaroni cheese all
before Charlie gets home from the gym
because he tells me off when I eat it
but it's my favorite right he's not bad
that's happened like milk cheese more
cheese you're like a naughty schoolgirl
don't want him to come home and catch me
in the act part emoji on no and I always
out faster so we have all the
ingredients that we need I have to have
rugby no in my mac and cheese I think
it's like I don't know something and
like when I have fish and chips or
batter sausage and chips I have to have
j2o does anybody else have that just me
all right let's try this you can go
downstairs let me go
hey guys it's been a couple of hours
since I picked up the camera laughs it's
been quite an eventful afternoon to say
the least I did go into a little bit of
a food coma after my mac and cheese
which is not very surprising is really
nice of the mustard in so definitely
give that a go if you haven't tried it
then well Charlie broke the oven
basically by pressing too hard on all
the little knobs and it's a brand new
oven so little bit about that and then
the washing machine massage break as
well with my incredibly expensive silk
pajamas in which are personalized and
were a gift from parents and yeah
basically broke with all the water
inside so I was panicking that my
pajamas were going to be ruined
had to like lift all the floorboards up
to get into the pump area drag all of
monkey crap out there was like hair
clips and stuff in there and basically -
drahma loads of bowls trying to pull all
the water out so that was really fun and
so yeah quite an eventful afternoon but
anyway on the plus side I also got some
unites mail today in the post I got a
lovely um gin cup and saucer from soap &amp;amp;
Glory and also a little cocktail
cookbook cookbook recipe book cocktail
book I don't know but um yeah there's
loads of lovely really festive drinks in
there so I'm gonna try some of those out
well so finally it got my diary from
design love Co I think it's called
they've personalized it which is really
cute it for a little jf in the corner
but it looks like it's been nibbled I
don't know if Dexter's had a lot other
go at it but I'm really annoyed this
basically took like six months to come I
originally spoke to them in like June
it's only just arrived so hopefully it's
gonna be worth it and also this
somebody you get this on me by dropping
ransom or post but my camera battery is
flashing and I just had a look I cannot
find either my spare battery or my
charger I think I might flatten my mum's
house but I don't remember taking them
at my overnight bags that's slightly
worrying but yeah this happened on
Saturday evening so I thought we could
just have you look through together
because that's always fun and I think
I've got some nice little festive bits
so I've already opened it up and I
remember ordering this jacket thinking
that looks really cool on the mater or I
think it's Paul and Joe pulling back
that's the one and then also a suede
miniskirt from them too this was an
absolute bargain I think this is about
12 pounds and it looks it was very
whistles easy I'll get that out of
plastic in a sec they always put little
treats in there as well
nice little pickup bar salmon and this I
think it's also a new look yeah
and I'm quite excited to have a look at
that oh yeah and then some festive
pajamas and another chocolate bar so let
me get these out the wrappers and show
you I can already tell this is going to
be a really cute outfit so I got this
it's kind of like a brown suede leather
really lovely soft kind of buttery
material skirt with this nice tie detail
and this is pull and bear and then the
jumper kind of matches this is from new
look but it's got that's got really
similar label to Zara it's at the same
company
I don't know if it's the same parent
company or not but that's like the same
style label anyway and then this cream a
jumper with a kind of stitch detail on
the side is from new looks I might try
those as an outfit together tomorrow
because Hannah's coming over you might
shoot some outfits not sure if I like
the PJs I just I feel like red white and
blue just reminds me yeah I feel like
red white and blue just kind of reminds
me of the Union Jack and yeah not too
much for firm of those so might send
those back the clutch I love kind of
like a white snake print with this gold
detail across the front and yeah this is
such a bargain
really need a nice little clutch bags in
the evenings
so that is beautiful and then the coat
is just a little bit big and yeah not
really sure how I feel about the coat it
looks a little bit larger than what I
was thinking probably not gonna be so
flattering on someone as tiny as me yeah
I'll try it on three in the morning and
show you guys what it looks like I think
I'm gonna put these on now these are the
hohoho nails of Holland nails I'm sure
they're House of Holland at she says
House of hohoho so definitely got that
wrong but yeah Christmas nails by
elegant touch and these are the
Christmas XS am i focusing on my camera
does not work so I over here
yeah they got little mints puddings and
I was under outfits so I think I'll pop
those on now we're about to go out for a
pub quiz which should be fun so this is
my Karen Millen jumper which I got in a
sale I think it was like half price I'm
really pleased with this and River
Island waxy effect genes and how ready
decided what shoes I'm gonna wear let's
have a little look maybe so dark
maybe these ones I think there's for my
Oasis yeah I'll go with these ones
morning guys it's Tuesday today I'm
really sorry I didn't finish last
night's vlog we went to the pub quiz in
the came third which isn't too bad
considering that we were pretty rubbish
overall but yeah I'm suppose what was
incredibly boring so I thought I'd do it
to day as stick today and yesterday
together
um but yeah today is hopefully gonna be
quite productive I have my little elf
under the tree Hannah
oh and I've long green again I'm hoping
that I'm not green in the actual vlog
footage my camera is really messed up
and I think I let rain get on it and
yeah Hannah is over we're gonna have a
productive day hopefully get some outfit
shots done and I'm hoping that today
might be my last working day to a
Christmas but yeah fingers crossed I put
on the house of hohoho elegant touch
nails last night and I actually feel
slightly crippled this morning try
washing the hair with these giant talons
on it doesn't really work
typing doesn't really work trying to get
dressed equally as challenging so yeah I
don't know just praying that it's that's
my laundry you don't want to see that
but it's gonna stop raining in a second
because yeah we need to be productive
and it's gross outside you know so
there's a couple of hours later now and
her and I have been super productive
we've probably photographed / filmed
maybe like six or seven or eight
hundreds of outfits basically so you had
a very productive morning I'm gonna
stick some soup on for us now naturally
we have just got into our comfy clothes
some hair up bra off actually our storm
that's a lie um but yeah lunch time now
and then we actually have a very lovely
afternoon planned at 3 o'clock in an
hour
um we have a masseuse coming and I'm
going to set up the bedroom all
beautifully with candles and lovely
music and whatnot and we're gonna have a
nice little massage each which should be
nice and fun and mums coming in a second
as well because she's gonna pick up all
that Christmas presents and
then back to her house which is very
kind of her so I'm kind of keeping a
lookout for her now it looks that we've
got timings perfect because it's past
time you um yeah
time for lunch my favorite chicken and
vegetable broth he loved so having bread
with a side portion of soup Frollo may
have come a little bit crazy with the
tiger bread being followed
I don't know what it is I think it's
just a mixture of all the festive stuff
yeah look my focus is completely
nothing is in focus right now apart from
the bread that's what matters not the
puppy dog just opened up a package which
just arrived for me in the post and it's
this phone case which I ordered from
Kate's to fire I think it's called and
it has sausage dogs on it which look
remarkably like my little boy I thought
that was quite good fun although I'm a
bit concerned because I actually ordered
two and it says quantity two on there
but there was only one in the box so
hopefully I'll be getting another
package but yeah I think that looks
rather snappy it's gonna make some
coffee for me in a sauna I'm gonna have
a Christmas capsule icing now don't
think I've tried that one you're not
sure what it is look what my nails fell
off so I need to try and find it let's
get this one I go okay let's see how
this tastes
coffee delivery hankyeol Hannah is
working and she's got a watcher how's it
feel yeah under pressure our masseuse
has just arrived I've never had a an
at-home massage before so yeah slightly
intrigued to see how this goes down I'm
holding onto this little beast because
with the door open he is likely to
hurtle
and those out do I arrange the music I
don't know but I've got my Christmas
coffee it was good so I've just put the
blind down in my semi bedroom / office
upstairs and now I'm just scouring for
some candles that I can take up I've got
a couple of these origins feel-good
candles which I think will be nice
create a bit of ambience and what else a
lot of rituals don't know what flavor it
is but this look do maybe one more maybe
like three candles and their dad's so
excited you ever had one of these before
Hannah what at home massage yeah I said
remember I had one and I had really down
towels and it was not enjoyable this
this seems really there's I do have a
massage bed last time Hatch's lying on
my bed - no my dad towels and this - for
her own massage that's amazing she's
putting my such bad she's bought um
music
she's got towels yeah so what I'm gonna
do is provide the candle it's not taking
my job looks sexy
Hannah is ready for her massage Simone
is ready to massage you and look at this
look at this we've got the candles all
lit up got the blind down Simone's got
the relaxing music playing yeah and my
mother's just got here so let's go and
deal with her I'm gonna have fun buying
poppy
exactly okay fine enjoy see you later
here mother's here it was good and now
it is my turn to have the massage so
here is our beautiful massage room I'm
having to vlog on my family cuz my
camera has died but um yes I'm really
looking forward to this
Hannah tells me it's absolutely superb
so I shall see you afterwards so I have
just come out of my massage which was an
hour long and full body massage which I
wasn't expecting so it's just saying -
Hannah very
that I shaved my legs this morning but
um I just have to go to sleep and relax
it was very relaxing not better than I
thought it was going to be actually I've
never had a massage at home before and I
think I'll do it again
it was good I was just trying to think
what kind of situation you you do that
in I guess if you have like girly pomp
evening laughter you don't want to go
out we just want chilling yeah if you've
set your bath then you've gone out for
that lunch and Stephanie's gonna come
home chill you have a message before you
got for dinner and stuff yeah fun of
wine just yeah SuperDuper relaxing all
you like to buy someone as a gift yeah
Christmas we're having a romantic
evening maybe a good idea for romantic
evening does anything like after a
stressful day at work I think they do
things like manicures and blow-dries yes
highly recommend I leave all the
information to milk down below which is
where we got our massages from and I
were just saying that how do they know
when an hour is over as well I thought
it was in the music but Hannah's lawyers
in the massage techniques if you're a
masseuse let me know because it's one of
these things that boggles my mind
yeah can hear and she's just pack it up
creaking upstairs and probably not gonna
do much now so chill it out Hannah's
just gone home and I've put some
clothing on this is the jumper that
Hannah made and my jeans I was not
planning on putting any clothes on but
then I remember that me and Tony went
you're going to see Star Wars tonight
but Charlie has just canceled on me he's
out probably drinking with a load of old
work colleagues one of whom is going off
gallivanting around the world and and
he's already bought the tickets but he
was like no I don't want to go honesty
of my friends just fine um but no
secretly I'm quite glad that I can have
an evening at home by myself with my
favorite man and do some editing I've
got loads of editing to do as I said I
want today to be my last work day so
yeah I'm gonna have a productive evening
I'm gonna stick on this channel for
documentary which is on instagramers
apparently
last night which I missed by so few
people tweeting about so I'm gonna stick
that on and and get to works I'm afraid
it's not gonna be terribly exciting
viewing but what I'm gonna do okay so
I'm just working and I've got this rich
kids of Instagram program on in the
background and I have to say I'm very
disappointed in this program it's
basically a load of kids that have got
their parents money and are just being
seriously tacky by taking photos of like
designer clothes and lots of money no
it's just really pretty but it's all
these kids have just it's literally
parents money like no one has earned any
of this money themselves and yeah just
not getting very good vibes friend I
think it's giving people who maybe do
work really hard to get oh that's my
daddy
give it a real um yeah I just think it's
giving a bad name to people that do well
out of Instagram I'm not saying that I
do but you know I just think it's bit
enough that this guy literally took a
flat lay of like a wall of cash a solid
gold phone case and like the image of
edition jeans yeah we are not amused
right I have managed to be pretty
productive and I've edited a whole video
I'm just uploading some footage for the
next video of the evening so I think I
deserve some food I spot it in the
cupboards earlier a little bit of
Sariah should help multitask I still
have a line on my forehead from the
massage table the eyes but did some
spinach pasta in the cupboard earlier so
I'm making that go sounds a little bit
gross
it's an honest cop each other
here we go spinach Tony
so I'm gonna give that a whirl see how
that takes and I thought about vibrating
Chelsea episodes I need to catch up on
turning into such a dream evening
standing me up I've got a spinach pasta
we've got the Made in Chelsea on
speaking of Made in Chelsea I'm feeling
a little controversial but does anybody
else notice that a lot of the characters
do sponsored instagrams and don't
declare them as sponsored like really
really obvious ones just get on my nerve
a little bit seems like there's a
different law for bloggers and youtubers
and instagramers then thereafter reality
TV stars just mean the note2 status I
feel like I might even like create
another account and be like this is
meant to be hashtag sponsored but it
does annoy me I finished my spinach
pasta but I'm still hungry so I've just
um got mine choice I've been condors I'm
feeling naughty and he's not texting me
back
so he's in my bad books so I'm gonna eat
all his Advent kind of chocolate haha
this is not texting me back
Charlie Santa's loading his sleigh I'm
loading my mouth with chocolate I have
to be honest I don't think tonight is
gonna get much more interesting for you
guys and I've just edited the first part
of log there's currently 23 minutes and
11 seconds so then I'm gonna end it here
because I'm literally not doing anything
else this evening
hopefully my boyfriend might show up at
some point but that's me being wildly
optimistic so oh I don't know what to do
with vlogmas over Christmas like dry
flogged on Christmas Day do i vlog on
Christmas even then upload on Christmas
Day I don't know so if you know like the
vlogmas etiquette then let me know or if
it's only a particular you want me to do
let me know I'm really not gonna vlog
like this on Christmas maybe do like a
montage or something and maybe schedule
Christmas Eve to go on Christmas Day
yeah don't know let me know what you
want to see but for now go to knocked
and I seal NZ morning and thanks just
farted yeah
night-night so cute but so smelly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
