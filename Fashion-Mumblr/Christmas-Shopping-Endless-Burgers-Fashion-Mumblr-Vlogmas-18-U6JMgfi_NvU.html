so does that make it look less than a 17
you know um I'm in bed with a my my
little boy and I'm editing the vlog that
you guys will have seen yesterday
hopefully I'm just debating whether to
cut out the clips of me think absolutely
ridiculously silly singing songs to my
dog I got long here's you are a sausage
really long sausage look at these little
back legs and tail I know him so much um
yeah debating I'm really shiny cuz I
just slap it on oil by the way I notice
is like furry faced person very faced um
yeah so I think I'm gonna leave them in
actually because I am a little bit crazy
and thought you guys might want to see
it but yeah if you haven't seen it it's
like let me tell you whereabouts in the
vlog it is hold on I don't know because
my I maybe is crashing but it's like
towards the beginning I'm just basically
singing to Dexter and maybe I should
have cut it out because I don't know but
yeah I am a crazy person so you've seen
it but yeah um when my laptop decides to
UM crash I'm gonna finish editing this
vlog then I'm gonna edit two blog posts
because I just want to get a little bit
ahead and I'm very behind at the moment
need to do some emails um
Charlie's made me a green juice and I
got a lemon sit because I'm still
feeling a little bit buttoned up yeah
that's my morning pretty much just made
myself some lunch which is pretty much
baby food and I'm gonna eat this in bed
although this little terror might have
something to say about it it's pretty
much just pasta shapes but yeah everyone
always teases me it looks like baby food
but when I'm poorly this is what I feel
like I'm gonna catch up on
