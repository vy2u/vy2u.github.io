Christmas gift guide video this is my
stocking filler Christmas gift guide and
everything in this video is under 20
pounds for most of it to be honest is
under 15 pounds so loads of really super
bargains and just really fun gifts that
I would love to receive in my stocking
and hopefully you guys would too so
hopefully this will give you some nice
fun Christmas gift ideas I am wearing a
Christmas jumper you can't see it but it
has got hours resting their little paws
claws feet resting their own feet on
candy canes and the at you can't really
see it but it's very province so I'm
going to kick things off and with
another jumper because I was just
telling you about my jumper and this one
you might have seen in my Primark
festive haul but I know jumpers aren't
very typically a stocking filler but
this one was only 12 14 pounds and it's
got a monkey emojis with Christmas hats
on on it and I guess if you wrap it up
kind of small it could fit in a stocking
but I just thought with the price and
it's really good fun I think this is
such an easy to love gift like them kind
of thing that you really like to receive
so that's my first Christmas stocking
filler it's from Primark so obviously I
won't be asking the link below for this
one so head into the store I got this
one from the Tottenham Court Road store
sticking with the kind of wearable theme
I thought these antlers from accessorize
are just a really fun one in fact I'm
going to put these on now because I
don't feel festive enough and my hair is
a little lackluster let's just say
better and I'm not festive no you can't
even see them and just I just look like
I have little ears what if I sit further
back is that better
now I look like a floating head okay I'm
just gonna sit further back and then you
can see my festive antlers I hope not I
feel like I'm so far away so I thought
these antlers were a really fun gift
idea they are though I didn't say price
but I can't like around the six pound
mark really not too expensive and as far
as Christmas boppers such headbands go I
think these are quite chic like I will
happily wear these to Christmas jumper
parties and on Christmas Day something
quite fun stocking filler especially if
you've got a kind of like bantery
relationship with somebody I just think
these are really really good fun and so
from the multi to the actual actually
useful products I've got two drinks
containers here this one is a bkr I
think that's what they're called BK our
beauty will save the world ocean is deep
the last water bottle this one is from
cult beauty and it's and it's a glass
water bottle which just is ultimately a
very chic item to have I think it's a
good thing for mainly that person always
kind of sometimes they don't drink
enough water like myself and it's got
this gray kind of silicone sleeve over
the top of it a little white heart in it
I just think it's really pretty very
chic and maybe not the kind of thing
you'd splash out on for yourself but a
lovely gift to give because I think it's
a very useful product and they'll think
of you whenever they flip their water so
nice one from cult Beauty bkr water
bottle and then this is a bandeau hot
stuff
thermal coffee mug which says the first
coffee I actually got this in the Asus
Black Friday sale I got 20% off and so
it's really cheap but it's got really
cute pink the lid I think it's a really
good gift idea for anybody that does
like to have their daily coffee it's got
an on and an open-and-shut thing there
so it's good for run
not spilling anything and yeah I think
quite cheap and cheerful but a really
cute coffee mug all the coffee lovers
actually know next thing that I'm
choosing to mention is a set of tea
towels now I've never seen details in
any ways Gift Guide before but if you
maybe know someone that's just moved
into a new home
someone at uni that's moved into Steve
accommodation or like the first time by
anybody like that these are some tea
towels from Radley now you don't have to
be a crazy dog lover because they are
just like super cute this set has got
two in there and there's like a
black-and-white dotty one and then this
one with the Radley dog in dots all over
it and I just think you know tea towels
again a really cute little gift idea
it's quite easy to buy for somebody that
has just moved into a new home and yeah
I think as I radley it's just something
a little bit more special about them and
they're very cute I thought they were a
nice little gift idea maybe if you have
a younger sister or some cousins nieces
or nephews
maybe not nephews in the family then I
thought this is kind of fun one so this
is a very supersoft
gingerbread man or gingerbread lady I'm
asked for when you sleep and it's just
super soft and cute is a little smiley
face on it I just thought is quite fun
little gift this is from Claire's
accessories really not very expensive at
all it's got the red elasticated back
maybe if you know somebody that's going
on holiday in the New Year they go a
long-haul flight or you know people that
just appreciate these cute little
novelty things I thought I'd stick that
one in there from Claire's accessories
this is quite a fun one for anybody that
likes a little cheeky drink every now
and then it is a Christmas jumper hip
flask so just really a normal hip flask
with a Christmas jumper on it which i
think is just such a fun idea this one
is from accessorize as well as the Atlas
yeah I just think it's a Riku idea
really fun things stick in the stocking
it's perfect for guys and for girls and
it's a basket it says on the back
morning this may leave you with a woolly
head in the morning now this one is
really perfect for anybody that likes
the finer things in life likes to
indulge themselves when I first opened
this actually so it was chocolate but it
is actually a selection of bath bombs so
this is a little quad portal double
quadruple so this is a little box of
beautiful floral scented bath bombs and
it's from Etsy so you can guarantee it's
like how many you know beautifully put
together with love not my but then it
smells so good actually making my mouth
water especially this kind of citrusy
one in the bottom but it's just four
really lovely not exactly bath bombs
kind of soapy party pampering products
got a lavender one I'm not sure what
that one is but it's got kind of like
purple purple leaves on it
citrusy one which is the one I want to
eat and this one looks like it's got
kind of rose quartz it kind of chunks in
it but I thought that was a really
lovely stopping for that for anybody
that likes a little bit of pampering and
it's just something a bit more unique
than stuff that you can buy on the high
street not that there's anything wrong
with normal shop bought stuff I just
thought that was a really nice
alternative something a little bit more
personal then I've got a pair of socks
I know socks notoriously are kind of
like roll your I type of presents but
these ones from Oasis I actually thought
were really cute really soft and fluffy
and actually quite useful they are in
normal kind of slipper socks they've got
the little woolen not willing back see
all the things on the bottom and waxy
dots so you're not going to slip around
all over the place I thought the pattern
was really cute and
so this one's just a gray with the white
details and this one is white with the
Stars so you get two pairs I think it
was 60s 6 pounds 2 pairs for 6 pounds
and you know it's just a nice thing to
have to bulk out this stocking and they
can really be to be presented with this
little bow on the top there as well
which is very cute but if you don't
think your gift receiver will appreciate
this kind of socks and I have even more
classy kind of option and these are from
the white company
these are cashmere socks white cashmere
very luxurious and they're actually bed
socks I have got these for my friend who
just has like a bit of thing the socks
doesn't like to be barefooted ever so
I'm just sorting lovely more luxurious a
sock option for a stocking thinner as
well this is a really fun one that you
could give to your guy or a girl and
it's a set of Christmas card games in a
box so it's 15 different Christmas
themed card games and I picked this up
from Selfridges so I'm trying to find a
link it doesn't say a brand on it unless
it's just called festive games but it
says you've got Santa says present pick
up festive tunes the father Christmas
laughing game wish list I have no idea
any of those games meaning what they do
but again I saw a really fun stocking
filler and good shape for a stocking
filler and you know if you know somebody
that likes to play games always watch
the cards out then this is quite a fun
festive addition to their game selection
then I've got a little tin of lip
smacker lip balms with the frozen
characters on it I know so many like
younger generation people that are just
obsessed with frozen right now and I
thought lip balms are a really useful
thing so if they're just too old toys
and that kind of stuff but still love
frozen then this is a genuinely very
useful but very fun Christmas gift and
they come in this snazzy little tin as
well which they can keep forever you can
keep your jewelry in there or anything
but they have got loads of different
flavors
see okay it doesn't say what flavors
they are it just says best flavor ever
so I'm sure these will all be super
delicious not illusion nothing you
should eat them but yeah just what I was
a really lovely gift idea can't remember
how much this is but I will leave all
the information down below for these and
the final thing is something which I
absolutely love it's so cute and I'd be
so pleased to receive something as
adorable is this under my Christmas tree
or in my stocking and it is this little
owl tree decoration from Gisela Graham
so I actually got this from accessorized
and but it's Gisela Graham which is or
who is a designer of just the most cute
and beautiful delicate little Christmas
tree decorations and general home
decorations I always spot the stuff in
garden centers and I actually first
spotted this in Selfridges although it
was the most double the price but it was
in accessorize this is self and pencil
so this is six pounds from accessorize
I just don't get so gorgeous it's a
beautiful miniature owl really light so
no no not a heavy Christmas tree charm
and he's got a sparkly face and he's
sitting on a little sparkly nog and I
just think it's so cute so kind of full
of character and just a lovely thing to
give again someone who just loves that
home or loves Christmas tree decorations
I think anybody would love this is just
so cute and so that's it that is the
selection of products which I've chosen
for my very first ever stocking filler
gift guide all of these things are under
20 pounds in fact I'm pretty sure most
of these are under 15 pounds so some
really lovely gift ideas and stocking
