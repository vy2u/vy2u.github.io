video today's video is not taking the
normal approach routine basically
Hannah's here ah and we decided to film
a Christmassy video because we like to
set up the Christmas tree is looking
good and we thought we would do a
Christmas Q&amp;amp;A slash Christmas tag video
but we only tweeted like 10 minutes ago
so sorry limited yeah we're gonna we're
gonna make this work
we never what's the word going to
improvise we can improvise going to
memorize so thank you to the two people
thank you to you guys who replied to us
you're very speedy I love how we're
probably like finish oh wait we have
more we should have we should have Tex
Charlie and Cris me I can't betray us
retweet us til we probably have about
ten questions that you guys have sent us
and then we're going to do Christmas
time as well just to pad this out a
little bit right so our first question
what who wait what what or who inspires
you
Oh what are who inspire you Hey
hmm I would say outside the blogosphere
Victoria Beckham yeah she's so good at
like branding has no no she is a brand
and I'm really like OCD about branding I
would say to me I read like
many protections as amazing books there
she's just really funny and cool and
might inspire you because she is not the
norm she's currently the Dunham she's
not the norm for like a famous woman and
she's not groundbreaking in that way and
I like it because she's I think it's
just size 12 which isn't big but it is
big in setup world fashion and she's
just I just think she's really cool many
funny see that's a nice which do you
like better
vlog in all the log in but looking every
time for me because it's about writing
writings my thing it's definitely a
thing but yeah I think mmm if you'd ask
me this about performance I would say
blogging as well and I definitely find
blogging easier but I think which I
prefer is vlogging because I do like I
want to do more vlogging next year
definitely but because it's not my
natural thing it's like it is like yours
me it's probably hard to work to vlog so
I guess I need to push myself I could
challenge for me so I am gonna do
monitor to have it definitely blogging
for me I'm the opposite I feel like
since I've been achieving more my blog
has gone a little bit I'm not so sure
enough I on YouTube easier known and
yeah actually whereas I'm gonna get a
blog redesign and yeah hope you that we
inspire my love of blogging
yeah how do you vlog every day what
motivates you
yeah today I have nothing to talk about
I think that's the hard thing is when
you have days like today when like I'm
not doing anything so something like
this is um super but then actually I
think you just have to be you have to
think that people will forgive you if
you don't
vlog every day yeah i think you will
notice it far more than any of your
viewers yeah and other bloggers will I
don't know anyone's gonna know any would
be like oh my god you mister day I don't
like you anymore
yeah people will forgive you but then at
the same time like just gets up
put some clothes on philippa makeup on
the lipstick a good Stronach today boys
no boys helps and a good coffee yeah we
just have a really strong coffee okay I
like this one what is your best memory
today that I think we're both gonna say
the same thing yeah I don't know what
you'll say that like there's like a
really obvious strong memory okay so for
me it was like the first time that we
probably hung out with our festival what
was it V Festival yeah I went to be
festival with sure and we're in the VIP
area and they were like oh should we
just go back to the tents before Luthor
we like get ready to come out to like
party in the evening and then the boys
are walking ahead and we were walking
behind and Hannah turns me and said if
this was just me and Chris we wouldn't
come back out and I say if this is just
me time we wouldn't come back out so we
didn't we just save them the tents we
stayed out Society to the tent and
listen to the music I was eating chips
massive festival fail oh honey I'm gonna
say who else if we're done together
maybe maybe a Switzerland then we went
to Switzerland with where to burn which
is the capital and we went on a private
jet but it felt like when you're on a
private jet and it was also a little bit
scary
rickety very rickety and I kind of
thought I might die but also really fun
so yep being in Switzerland and feeling
you know I thought you were gonna say to
Switzerland we basically it wasn't just
bloggers or some journalists on this
trip as well and we taught them how to
do this about whenever I tweet about
Instagram now but they always at each
other in it and they go yeah the squid
some point we told them about the grid
so you're pretty much a ring made up
everyone else hashtags mostly the grid
yeah and I see the Instagram in terms of
the grid what's your favorite Christmas
movie this is also quite the Christmas
time question okay okay
how do you know each other how did you
meet we I think we've been following
each other on social media for a while
what we sound like
we've been talking about Facebook for a
bit like a relationship and
and we trying to go for coffee from here
coffee for ages and then we both knew no
we didn't then we ended up going you
invited me to the Ella Eyre gig of shore
yeah that was the first time we met I
think it's like a date like immediately
to me and then we had V Festival a few
days later charlie crist so yeah that's
how we met yeah they asked same question
twice how do you know each other how did
you meet you know each other it's
reblogging okay so this one says I just
read this as happy I'm cheatin each
other but actually it says you ever
cheated on a test no I don't think say I
have and I got caught out it was one of
those science like not GCSE because that
would be really bad it was like snowy
new day starts it was like you 9
definite wasn't stuff it was at end of
year
ok you won't get into it were you I was
but I was it was his test where it was
like all about the Bunsen burner and how
do you find out what carbon dioxide is
and I just do you I have a song so my
revision technique was to make up songs
of things so guys carbon dioxide tends
milky white gem rekindled light hydrogen
gets pops been extinguished water
moisture pivot n spin and you make that
out yeah I know one for ideas what do
you think you'd be doing if you wanna
learn an internet sensation Trixie do
you think you'd be a pop oh yeah that
was that was my revision technique I
think I just read the textbook and
teacher came over and she saw no I have
a better ones that actually was an IT
test and I realized that my computer
that I was on had the sound switched on
and you obviously know a lot on the
internet during RT tests because T test
okay so I went on the internet and
didn't realize that my computer had the
volume switched on and it was one of
those stupid pop-ups
don't sound like a salmon God is Protege
it's not your own this grout is Protege
oh my god that was a good another good
memories memory consistency little
Kingston if there's not the money yeah
what is your favorite thing to do
together in London but you know we just
had to rush between events but I'd
imagine what my favorite thing to begin
to do would be would probably macarons
and have coffee you might go to Paris so
if we go to Paris that's pretty much all
day and she'll hit photos photos of
foreign girls if they chose me coffee /
hot chocolate and spec ones probably 50
yeah
may I do so from Arama McDonald's or KFC
McDonald's every single time double
cheeseburger medium fried egg salad it
this is a little bit chopped onion and
it's a must in it not oh there's no
tomatoes in there and catch us ID like
one chicken then crush it a bit popping
together no matter pop one chicken butt
that's right I like fried chicken by
just one can see it's not very done very
well no places in London
I don't know I'm th oh no no I'm not
like a cheap cheaper job like a good
place so we went this place into New
York where it was like um fried chicken
on waffles and it was so good what are
your hobbies
now why don't you have any hobbies
blogging as a hub a job I go swimming
sometimes we get to Pilates once a week
but that's not a hobby I like skiing
really want to say something like candle
making but I don't make
sorry what we kind of make it reversible
Chris except for Christmas last year we
store I've done it I used to make
jewelry and it used to look like little
sweetums like liquorice allsort are on
their max before years ago I was about
that long ago when I was 16 days to make
jewelry which was just buttons as
earrings
they please to love them people used to
ask me to make phone for them I really
want to show it's looking really nice is
Linda might be more what's your favorite
Christmas scent candle or fragrance
Christmas cookie my uncle Daniel it's so
good it's just really dismiss that
happiness is your something really fancy
noise well I was going to say German
income going wrong but all year round
but next Christmas here small oh yeah it
really does oh my god this one what's
the most festive thing you've done this
year putting this little you'll know a
headband on it I baked some mince pies
they're really really ugly
so they tasted so good battery sugary
alrighty so we reached the end of our
questions but we are not through with
you just yet we thought we'd also do the
Christmas tag sing as it's Christmas and
you need more video I don't notice
myself doing it that's really tragic
so we already Anna we didn't our
savagery nice was film was your favorite
Christmas mine is actually the holiday
some people are like that's not even a
Christmas film but it definitely is
watched in something I don't watch any
of time of year but yes my favorite that
old man and oh my god he just lit to you
so makes me cry what about you and I
really like that one I think it's
the Santa Claus when he finds the
business card waiting in the back in my
mouth oh dear how you ever had a white
Christmas
nope no no I don't have one like five
years ago I feel like they said they
counted that it was a white Christmas
because a few snowflakes in London but
no no you you went skiing over Christmas
months I've been skiing your cousin's a
few times how do you usually spend your
holiday
well I'm normally British Christmas on
Christmas Eve and then spent Christmas
Day with my dad and brothers and stepmom
this year sure I'm spending the whole
time in Ipswich what are we going to be
fun a cycle first Chris Warner cycle
third Christmas together our first one
just us just you know Christmas I am
going um my brother and his wife live in
Gloucestershire still so they will be
coming to us on Christmas as you know
those last year's patents
I'm seeing my brother tomorrow and
that's that's the only time I'm seeing
my brother and his family and then
Christmas Eve and mum and Charlie and in
Christmas Day mum and I are going to
choice family house because when Charlie
and I met we met the parent I'm so ready
yeah so we're going to go to try family
and I'll be a huge long table verse 20
verse was pretty nice although I do miss
those days when you just kind of like
don't get out your pajamas yeah although
I'm quite like being at an age now I
mean you'd probably don't do this where
I can just sit and slowly get but I'm so
squinting so I'm looking at my questions
and I'm just sprinting what is your
favorite Christmas song
Oh too oppressive oh you see if I'm
right Mary
a little bit gets on my voice welcome
this is my man I like a bit of beyblade
yeah actually my favorite Christmas song
isn't it so happy and this probably
isn't even a Christmas song it's
actually called something about it's got
the word three-minute by Melanie
Thornton who could I be that definitely
is a nice tone it's not though the
holidays are coming okay so is a
Christmas song that is my favorite
Christmas song
do you open any presents on Christmas
Eve I saw you just said you did I do any
more but ponies Christmas polish people
and I think a lot of Europe celebrate
Christmas Day on Christmas Eve so I used
to say no you know can you name all of
Santa Santa Santa's reindeer literally
Rudolph Rudolph prompts dancer Donner
Blitzen Blitzen Blitzen how many other
what holiday traditions are you looking
forward to the most this year just
seeing people like I think for me I get
really really lonely being in the house
I mean at the cat's all day so just the
long hashtag doll mommy mommy um yeah so
I'm seeing my family this weekend and
then getting to see Christmas family
just making people mind is like hey
maybe I'll do that this year and like
bringing cranberry tartlets
breathe baked in the oven with red
currant jelly and time and then that
crispy bread that sounds so
good maybe I'll make something smells
food is your tree real or fake real - -
what is your all-time favorite holiday
food / sweet treat
probably the cheese board more the
sausage and bacon mmm I used to be like
only sausage got to make them gonna be
my own answer but now because I maybe
I'm getting more of a quiet palate yeah
I like dates wrapped in bacon we just
discussed this be honest do you like
giving gifts or receiving gift giving up
give them definitely I think I hope more
that's hard to buy for yeah and I feel
really awkward opening presents even if
I like them I feel like I'm lying even
if I really like them I feel like I'm
never coming across as sincere where as
giving them yeah I'm racking I'm gonna
find me no wrapping and last I ramp in a
minute before Charlie gets home yeah
definitely giving what is the best
Christmas gift you've ever received I've
never received anything like oh my god I
can't like does that make sense I've
never received like a holiday or a
expensive thing hmm I'm sure there's
some really nice sentimental things I
did get a couple of Christmases ago a
mulberry lady bag and actually an
ex-boyfriend had bought me a mulberry
purse my birthday like a month before I
was really spoiled yeah and so I saw the
more we carry a bag and I was like oh
you're reusing the carrier bag cheeky
you but actually it wasn't that was
probably the best
nice Christmas I'm gonna go ahead here
and say and the only present I can
actually remember is when I got married
a party for for the magic marry party
for for my GameCube that was really idea
for me getting queued like a tease
thank you for like what would be what
would be your dream place to visit for
the holiday season New York
I've never been to Neil the Christmas
you know what about tourists there it's
always busy okay when in June you know
it was so so busy and I'm something why
is that when you're in June and we're
trying to come up with say the Maldives
but are you a pro present rapper or do
you fail miserably I'd say I'm in the
middle like I don't think I'm really bad
at the same time I don't put like pine
cones and mistletoe and holly on them I
just wrapped them up
Thank You best ring on it sometimes I
feel like if people rap too much than
they're kind of this is my rapping I
think it's okay okay that's better a
little bit better than mine mine you
looks like that but that though it's
alright I couldn't be offended if
someone gave me the presents I rap like
medium a pro then what is your most
memorable holiday moment I'm gonna say
something from last year which is quite
gross no it wasn't last year two years
ago now we took my Nana her nursing home
the first time Chris had ever met her
she has dementia and she had one glass
of coke with ROM or something in and she
just predictable yeah that's where it's
gone oh my god top that
well it's always you know I remember
books are comping to anything so much do
you make news resolutions and do stick
to them I don't I tend to just make
goals for the next year things I'd like
to achieve like a certain amount of
followers on Instagram and it sounds
really bad or like holidays you know say
for like Instagram yeah I think that's
last year yeah I think I've wasted then
a path name gonna happen I think is my
email subscribers but I'm not too
worried about that so yeah very good
ones mine is always like drink more
water do more exercise yes yeah I never
stick to them so just everyday many more
yeah what makes the holidays so special
for you I'm gonna say again spending
time with your favorite people and
actually like everyone having time of
work and having times is chill out and
do nothing because I feel like often
when you're seeing a family it's like a
really rushed environment or you have to
pull everyone relaxes so much more and
you just eat so much and drink so much
and it's just me I think yeah the same
and like when you're way on holiday
those bloggers we ever need to switch
off no Christmas it actually is that
yeah yeah even if it's just for like two
days
just time away I'm not gonna blog over
Christmas like for a couple of days or a
couple days yes and that's it that is
the end of our Christmas tag Christmas Q
and a video we might feel some film we
might feel something on Hannah's channel
we may not but I will leave her channel
down below just in case ya guys don't
mind that this is a replace replace in
the place of locking us today but today
we're really boring
apart from this so yeah see you
