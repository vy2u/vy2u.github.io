it's gonna be quite festive one today
may talk about to go and get our
Christmas trees but hopefully we're
going to get one we've got quite strict
specifications needs to try and find one
that Dexter won't be able to jump up on
I'll get the low-hanging balls so yeah
we're gonna head to the comment and see
what we can find
do you guys like my hat I absolutely
love it this is one that my mom got me
for my birthday if some people commented
on my birthday vlog asking her as from
but I'm afraid it's from a local lady
that kind of goes from different
Christmas stools and things like that so
I can't really tell you how to get it
from but I have got a friend who makes
hats like this called pom-pom poodles
I'll leave the link of that down below
because they all really really love me
and they have pretty much identical to
this but without the sequins on you
could pretty do that yourself but just
gonna put Dexter's Christmas jumper on
now Charlie's naggin got him a really
cute little jumper so I'm just gonna
have a look for that and then we're
gonna head out to buy our Christmas tree
yesterday no trees here today so yeah
we'll try again tomorrow
so that was an epic fail there were no
Christmas trees there I mean why would
there be
Christmas trees there one day and not
the next I have no idea maybe maybe
they'll come at lunchtime or something
this is only half 10 so yeah I might do
some photography now because it's not
actually too bad outside it's quite
bright which is rather rare for this
time of year so yeah my did a bit of
photography I've got a couple of posts I
need to photograph but first I'm gonna
have a nice cup of coffee we recently
got the Christmas and espresso cup seals
and Charlie this little brown box
proper to store them we also threw away
the boxes so now I have absolutely no
idea what these flavors are I mean they
have names like dole sow or let's see
Ross our buyer but I have no idea what
they mean I have a red one yesterday and
it's really nice and festive this one
definitely looks like a Christmas one it
doesn't have any writing on it but it's
silver for little twit early bits on it
so I'm going to give this one a try
so I'm just gonna go and slip on my
coffee and crack on with some emails but
yeah first I need to just figure out
what I'm gonna do for my photography
because the lighting is good and yeah we
need to crack on
so before I start my emails I just
wanted to do a little Instagram photo so
I'll show you how I do most of my photos
depth stuff he shreds everything he
absolutely loves poinsettia leaves as
well but I think they're apparently
mildly toxic to dogs No so I try to
avoid him eating those but yeah let me
show you my Instagram setup over here so
this is a marble table which I got from
Oliver bonus and it's really cute it's
got like little gold legs which you can
kind of see under there but here's my
little Instagram setup this is a kiss
most kit which we got from the German
own party last night
and it had some mistletoe in there a lip
balm and some mint so everything you
need for it good snug under the
mistletoe and then this is the lovely
box which I got personalized with a
little bow and inside I don't want to
ruin the perfect bow but it's got sea
salt or is it wood salt wood so on sea
sage perfume in there and then I just
put my coffee in there because it's nice
and pretty and then these are just some
floral Gold sparkly items which I picked
up from our local garden center so let
me show you how the photo came out quite
pleased with that this is quite bright
in here at the moment so yeah that's how
I got the photo are you monkey stop it
