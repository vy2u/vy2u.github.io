this video today because I think I have
just discovered the holy grail of nail
stuff it's basically this kit which
turns any nail polish into a gel polish
so that means any of your nail varnishes
at home can be converted into a two or
three week long manicure and the kit in
question is this and it's the ciate gel
tox starter kit says on the box can turn
any nail polish into a gel polish in
just 60 seconds so the great thing about
this kit is that you can literally turn
any of the nail varnishes that you
currently own at home it doesn't have to
be the ciate brand it can be any now
Ornish that you like into a gel polish
just by using this topcoat that it comes
in the kit i personally absolutely love
gel nail varnishes i think that it's
just so much better than normal nail
varnish because it lasts up to three
weeks on your nails you don't have to
worry about them getting chipped it's
always really shiny and they just have a
kind of I don't know a really nice
texture kind of plump effect to them so
I love gel manicures what I don't love
though is going to salon sitting there
for I don't know like an hour spending
around 60 pounds in London it's kind of
crazy expensive to get gel nails done
whereas this kit which I picked up from
ASOS beauty was just under a hundred
pounds and with this kit you're gonna
get at least I'd say like ten manicures
probably more actually out of this
you're gonna be saving a lot of money
and I think now is definitely the time
to do it because coming up to summer
going on beach holidays and I find on
holiday that if I go in to see if I've
got some cream on perfume then normal
nail varnish just tends to go a little
bit sticky and gross whereas gels
obviously stay perfect for the whole
holiday but anyway enough of me talking
about it what you guys are here for is
the video review slash tutorial so you
can decide whether you like it or not so
enjoy let's start by looking at what's
inside the box so you've got the shotty
nail file and buffing block which you
can use to shape and smooth the nails
before you get started then there's a
gel tops cleanser which prepares the
nails before you apply the varnish and
is also used to remove the sticky
residue after you finish the manicure
then there's the CRJ gel toxic topcoat
there's
the gel coat which you paint over your
nail varnish and there's an orange stick
which you can use for pushing back
cuticles and cleaning up the nail bed it
doesn't have to be a sassy nail varnish
which you use to do the manicure in fact
you can use any brand of nail varnish
that you like so the first thing to do
is file your nails personally I'm using
a glass nail file I find that it stops
my nails from splitting but you can use
the nail file which comes in the set
next I'm using my tweezer my nail
clippers just to get rid of any of those
little bits down the side of the nails
and then going in with a cuticle oil
this is the SD cuticle oil just to
smooth the cuticles before I push them
back you could use the orange stick but
I personally just prefer using my thumb
nail to push my cuticles back then
you'll need the Ciotti gel tox cleanser
just to make sure the nails are
completely ready for the first layer of
nail varnish this makes sure that the
nails are completely clean and slightly
dehydrated so the underwire shall last a
little bit longer
then just as you would with any other
manicure start with your base coat and
make sure the whole nail is completely
covered with quite a light coat
here I'm using Essie strong as nails
base coat
next she's the nail varnish that you're
going to paint your nails with I've
recently been loving at the shade 274
freesia from a brand called mavala
but you can use literally any now vanish
you like
you want to make sure your nails are
beautifully neat and tidy so use the
corrector pen such as this one from OPI
just to make sure there's no nail fash
anywhere except for your nails
then it's important to wait 30 minutes
at least to make sure your nail finish
is completely dry before you do anything
else
okay and time's up so the next thing to
do is reach for the CRT gel tox top coat
the important thing here is that you put
quite a light base on so don't put it on
too thickly otherwise it might be more
likely to chip off
make sure you give the whole nail a good
covering and even cover the tops of your
nails as well just lightly brush it over
the tip and this will stop any peeling
from happening
you can use the orange stick just to
make sure that none of the top coat has
gone onto your skin
then just pop your fingers underneath
the light and press the button
after 60 seconds just move the light
around to cover your thumb as well
if you announce to be ultra shiny and
long-lasting you can do another coat of
the gel top top coat and seal them again
so that's it guys I now have perfectly
manicured nails thanks to the kit I'd
say that whole process took me around 25
minutes so it's really really quick and
easy I'm gonna go and do my toes now
which I don't really think you guys want
to see on video I hope you've enjoyed
this and found it useful and I hope
maybe I've helped you decide whether you
want to get this kit or not personally I
think it is an absolute groundbreaking
kit in the terms of nail varnish does
that make sense I don't know so I hope
you've enjoyed this video please please
give me a thumbs up if you did I'd love
it also if you would subscribe to my
channel and then you will see lots and
lots of lovely new videos if you would
like to buy the kit I will pop a link
below to where I got it from which was a
sauce and yep
I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
