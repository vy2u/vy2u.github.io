another daily vlog it's Monday morning
and today is my town days so I had to
get my schedule soldiers that I'm only
in the central London to like a two days
a week because otherwise I don't get
anything done any work done so today's
one of those days
um they started with a breakfast meeting
which was nice and productive at me ivy
cafe in Marylebone really really nice
had a spinach and avocado on toast and a
nice beetroot juice so feeling it good
and healthy now I'm going to do a little
bit of shopping before my next meeting
which that hard twelve and Charlie's
coming that one as well so quite busy
but fun day ahead
so I found myself on new Bond Street and
obviously can't afford anything else
along here that has just been window
shopping but I just went into Gucci to
kind of try on the dionysus bag because
I'm very very tempted to get one of
those and I have to say that the
in-store experience is actually really
really good normally when I finally go
into these shops are very exclusive they
kind of look you up and down and they
decide whether you can afford it or not
and either pay you attention or not
based on that normally I just find a
little bit cold and sterile but actually
that was a really nice experience
especially considering it's Gucci
so maybe shops trying to change their
ways and be a little bit more welcoming
to the average person which is wonderful
so I'm now going to go and grab a coffee
meeting charlie around here in about 20
minutes
or maybe like half an hour 45 minutes so
Sinn féin little face and get on with
some emails Wow
where's Chad now and we've just been to
a fragrance consultation with a company
called Killian which is rather luxury
fragrance is unisex fragrances and we
both got our own little sample which
we're going to try out for both now on
healthy lunch and then I've got a facial
at 2:30 with a body shop which should be
rather lovely what are you doing to
suddenly nothing I'm trying to beat man
clay so I'm currently in like a battle
and I think losing death Texas tax is
going to cover myself in while I do some
blog posts and help me be man
so just a taxi on my way to my next
meeting I just had my body shop facial
and it was in this little South not
salon little room above South Molton
Street and the lady used the body shop
face masks which I've got at home so
I'll show you later to give me the kind
of feature that I could recreate at home
which was really really lovely I would
definitely be recreating this on my
Panther evenings she had a good old
analysis of my skin and then recommended
that I use the ginseng mask which is a
purifying mask and she actually mixed it
with a serum so that it wasn't quite so
harsh she said because she said I've got
some broken capillaries so she used that
with a serum to give a really nice
massage which was just heavenly and then
she used an oil to really deep tissue
massage my face so obviously our face
holds a lot of tension and while we
massage your shoulders and legs and
things we don't ever really massage our
face so she gave my face a really deep
massage surprise
I'm out with bruises or anything really
clearing the sinuses which was nice
and then she applied some steam my face
to open the pores and then this little
machine which kind of sucked my skin she
called it the kissing machine and that
just helps to invigorate the skin so it
allows more ingredients to go in and
then she mixed an oil with the I think a
CEP Ethiopian honey mask which again she
just massaged in really really
thoroughly and all of these masks I have
at home so definitely going to be
recreating with that and then while the
final serum was sinking in she had these
hot lava stones which she massaged my
backwards and I said how can I do that
at home so don't have the lava stones
and the lady was saying that she can
just you can just put a hot-water bottle
behind your shoulders while you give
yourself a little facial so definitely
something I'll be recreating next stop
is the Dean Street townhouse for my next
meeting so I'll catch up with you
conference in case you couldn't tell
that with me
hey guys so I just got back home again
from my day out in town and it looks
like oh yeah I don't hang up on as I
lose the glymed gots gone but then I
remembered of course I had the facial so
don't have any makeup on duh I have got
melted brain syndrome and yeah just got
home annoyingly my last meeting I went
to the places went to meeting her and
she'd forgotten so that was a nice
wasted trip slightly annoying but never
mind these things happen um got home
hoping that a special delivery might
have been dropped off here but it hasn't
which is rather annoying so hopefully
it's going to arrive tomorrow you may
know what I'm talking about you may not
but I'm not going to spoil the surprise
come on in do an unboxing video um see I
just got home
gonna put in some gonna put on some
comfy clothes do a little bit of work
and then we're going to carry on making
our halloween invitations because we had
to order some stuff from Amazon because
you didn't have jiffy bags we didn't
have fake blood so that's going to be
the task this afternoon but first of all
I'm gonna take my boots off take my
jumper off put on some tracky bottoms
and get comfy
so I just opened up some blog amel if it
would quickly show you the highlights
first of all there's a new range and now
from molten Brown and this is the arosa
absolute range smells really really
luxurious
I just smelt the above and shower gel
I've also kindly sent me the body lotion
they smell very opulent very rich almost
a little bit kind of perfume II like Tom
forty really really nice and amazingly
they also sent me this Smithson oh hello
Dexter
Dexter's just going to walk all over it
move your booty and it also really
kindly sent me this notebook which says
top secret which is just really really
cool look how luxurious it is with the
gold pages so this is definitely going
to be my like handbag notebook from now
on absolutely beautiful
sausage it doesn't need your help Thank
You Melanie
and then from this brand called some
more we're just gonna have to deal with
Dexter rummaging through everything let
me show you over here so I don't leave
recognize this design but I used to wear
one of these rope bracelets with this on
it every single day but only yesterday
or the day before it finally like broke
off so such a coincidence they sent me
one from their new collection and this
is the Christmas range and this is a
letter J on a lilac ribbon so I'm going
to be putting that on straight away and
that's a brand called some more I've
also been sent the new birch box and
these are based on your birthdate so as
I'm a Sagittarius born in November and
they sent me the fire box which i think
is why i start on my star sign my
element and inside really really excited
about this little mini dry texturizing
spray from obey a rituals body lotion
and this is a pure spring water face
spray little hair oil um and also a load
and very very nice autumnal lip crayon
so lovely eight little Birchbox and then
from l'oreal i have this exciting gift
set um I think
I think this is probably a press edition
with their new gold obsession lipsticks
in and I think all of these has about
six in here and see if I can get one out
I think all of these have got like a
gold shimmer to them let's have a look
yeah so this one is pretty much a gold
shimmery lipstick very similar to a new
Tom Ford one actually so I'll definitely
be comparing the two of those also very
kindly been sent a box of goodies from
pixi by petra i love the sound of this
rose oil blend with pomegranate and rose
oils that's a nourishing face oil sounds
really really lovely this is a massive
nourishing cleansing balm probably going
to try this tonight because that sounds
absolutely gorgeous and this is a blush
duo so you've got the blusher and little
brush really nice gift idea and many of
their classic glow tonic really good
travel size I also want to show you this
new range that came the post today from
L'Oreal professional this is their
neutral flyer neutral fire glyceryl in
cocoa oil range and there's a shampoo
conditioner and deep conditioner oh and
a dd cream so DD is what um defense
dryness defense
okay so we've had BB CC and now dd cream
dryness defense and this range is all
silicone free so really good for the
long-term benefit of your hair doesn't
fill you how those chemicals and kind of
falsely smooth your hair it's actually
really really good for your ads not
include silicone but most products do
and it kind of gives you a false sense
of smoothness so I'm really looking
forward to trying there's got a
deodorant from Neal's Yard remedies this
sounds really nice rose and geranium
aluminium free and then a huge bottle of
dr. Andrew Weil by origins mega mushroom
skin relief soothing treatment lotion
I'm not actually tried this before but
it is a cult product so I'm looking for
to getting that ago so that's just a
snippet of my blogger mail from today
look how disgusting my hair and face
looks needs getting a shower and but
before I do just wanna quickly ask you
what kind of video you'd like to see for
the beauty advent calendars from storing
them down there on the floor do you want
to see like just me too
about them or do you want to see me
opening them let me know in the comments
below I'm gonna get a shout out because
somebody think this wasn't bad time
I'm afraid this is not your bed Renee no
it's not hey guys sorry I didn't finish
vlogging properly yesterday it was a
typical example of me
just getting super super tired as I tend
to do like after 8 p.m. and yeah I don't
really fancy picking up the camera so it
is just after lunchtime on Tuesday now
and you haven't really missed that much
this morning I got up I had a shower I
curled my hair because I want to film a
couple of videos today then I filmed the
try on clips for my a sauce haul which
hopefully I'm going to edit in a second
and publish straight away so hopefully
you'll see me asshole last night and so
yeah that's pretty much what's happened
so far today just redone my makeup
because I had lunch and then I got like
pasta sweats and you need to redo it so
yeah I'm now gonna film another whole
video this one is going to be a bit of a
premium haul
it's got some bits in it from Club
Monaco and All Saints a few of which you
saw me pick up either on snapchat or in
my comment garden haul by thought I'd
stick it all into one video as almost
like an autumnal investment thesis video
so I'm going to film that in a second
I'm just waiting for try to get shower

in a jacket so yeah that's the plan for
today and then this afternoon I'm so so
so so so excited because I'm going for
afternoon tea so it's such an itchy face
whenever I put makeup on I don't if it's
like the brushes so itchy I'm going for
afternoon tea at the Sanderson hotel
which is that on the Berkeley are my two
favorite new teas in London I know you

heading out now after filming three
videos so I had a super productive
afternoon I'm heading out now straight
to the Saunderson Hotel the afternoon

cashmere top from a sauce
which you'll see in an upcoming hall and
then this is my red energy late
jeans are some old ones from Greece
quality tote bag and my top shoppings
which you probably have seen in a whole
video from a little while ago
guys I have another London fax for you
so I just showed you that lamppost with
the CC logo that's like a Chanel logo
and apparently the reason why that logo
is on loads of things like post boxes
and lamp post like that is because the
king who was ruling at the time that
they were all implement it I think it
was like King Edvard or something he was
having an affair with Coco Chanel which
is why the logo is on loads of London
landmarks like that
to commemorate her and to just be a
romantic sign in fact there's another
one coming up here so I'll show you what
I mean so this is just a lamppost and
it's got the Chanel logo on it and yeah
another fact from Jay actually he said
that that's because the king was having
an affair with Chanel nearly at the
sonocent now and a girl just bumped into
me in Boots and she recognized me and
said that she really liked my work and
it just made my day really so thank you
that lovely lady with the incredible
platinum blonde hair if you're watching
that doesn't happen to you very often so
when it does I don't really know how to
react but it's very very exciting
you
penguin
here we got $18 with the chocolate and
discussion on marshmallow ah-choo
between inside and a puppeteer on
ladybug bunch of animals middle
everybody laptop and the Indian for you
with so many and the single shot which
is Jake me page XO discrete
Wow
left the burners tavern I was persuaded
to have two pornstar martinis with the
lovely Mandy from a sauce which is
really really nice feeling a little bit
more jolly now and I'm going to quickly
pop in to Liberty because it is a
diptych event there this evening so I'm
going to quickly hop in there see what's
going on it's master class so I don't if
we're going to be like making our own
candles or something don't if that's
acceptable to rock up to a blogger event

see
so I have just left tip teak has another
glass of champagne now I think this is
the most tipsy I have been in quite a
long time which is a great concern in to
work day
I'm going to head to River Island now
and pick up my click and Collect order
if the shop isn't shut off this tree is
so busy but it's like 8 o'clock at night
so it may be time a little bit of late
night shopping
home again and I'm back with my little
boy who I have been kissing a lot for
the past half an hour and Charlie's
downstairs as well um I thought I would
end this vlog by just quickly showing
you a few of the amazing pieces that the
lovely ladies at Gillen have given me to
try out because their range is just
absolutely stunning I've also got a
little doggie bag from the Sanderson
from what afternoon tea I might just
have a little midnight snack on those
now so the girls at Ghulam have totally
spoilt me and Dexter is very keen to see
what's inside each sausage get your nose
out of there so naughty
god this bag smells so amazing so let me
just get everything out to show you ah
just so many amazing amazing pieces this
one I'm really excited to try it's their
pure radiance cleansing cream and it's
just basically an old-school cream
cleanser I'm going to give that a try in
a second I'll show you the packaging of
this it's absolutely stunning
so you get this massive fabulous jar
which is just so luxurious and I think
this retails for under sixty pounds as
well and I thought it was much more
expensive and then inside you've got
this beautiful cream Dexter is far more
interested in the packaging naughty boy
and then they've also kind of given me a
honey gel at Mars from their obaid
Royale range which I think I will wear
maybe leave on my skin overnight this is
a colonic candle I mean how much more
luxurious can you get than a gallon
candle the extras just fascinated this
is a terracotta
Sun serum which basically you apply
before during and after your holiday to
make your tan last longer so I love
things like that this one is the I think
this is a makeup brushes and absolutely
texture please okay come here sausage so
inside it's just a beautiful pink makeup
brush my god I don't realize I'm getting
so much help
sausage let mummy do it by herself you
look a beast oh he actually helps me
that and so inside this beautiful
packaging is a gorgeous brush and I
I'm going to use this in its packaging
as my handbag makeup brush for applying
bronzer on the go
Dexter's just going to enjoy devouring
the packaging and then this one is a
honey face treatment oil and it's a dry
oil so it just instantly vanishes on the
skin I cannot wait to give this a try it
feels so luxurious tried it on my hands
earlier you may recognize this from my
Instagram that I posted earlier today
and then we've got a radiance
resurfacing facial peel an SOS farm
which is fabulous for the autumn winter
just basically helps with dry skin or
any areas of concern and finally last
but not least this is the kiss kiss lip
lift texture can you just be quiet for a
few seconds no and then this last one is
the kiss kiss lip lift and this
basically looks like a nude lipstick I'm
trying it out and show you and you apply
this as a lip primer so put this on
before your lipstick and not only does
it stop it bleeding but it just makes
for a really lovely base and makes your
color last longer so I'm looking forward
to giving that go tomorrow really nice
with autumnal dark shades because they
do tend to go a bit a well sometimes
okay so in the bathroom I've got the
camera inside the bathroom cupboard
first of all I'm going to remove the
bulk of my makeup and I'm going to use
my Garnier micellar oil infused water
which my skin absolutely loved
and now that my face is mostly clean I'm
going to use the gallon pure radiance
cleansing cream which is in this amazing
packaging so this is tub and I'm going
to give some little bit of this on my
face massage it in and then remove
Hey
this feels so luxurious like Wednesday
one wash it off like I want to leave it
under the mask so I might just massage
it in for a few more minutes before I
take it off it smells absolutely
gorgeous okay I've taken big fans of and
as you can see you have a bit of a panda
eyes I'm going to use my Charlotte
Tilbury take it off I makeup remover
never really talked about this before I
really like these expensive pump your
comrade in Tibet
and now that my skin is lovely and clean
I'm going to try the ghulam skin
resurfacing appeal pure radiance
and I think this is one I have to leave
on for five to ten minutes and it is an
exfoliator but it's an acid exfoliator
not one with microbeads so you can
either either one or you can massage it
for five minutes
personally I'm going to go and put
texture to bed while this works it's
magic and then take it off in a few
moments time I'm dissing Evelyn and
that's our first
okay I will see you in five minutes back
again and I'm going to take off the mask
I can't even really feel on my skin it
just feels a little bit sticky but it's
definitely stuck into my skin a little
bit which is perhaps a little bit
concerning considering its kind of an
acid product but once again I'm just
going to take it off with a warm wet
flannel
okay skin is feeling super clean and
nice and dry now and I'm going to use a
little bit of my Estee Lauder advanced
night repair eye cream I always use this
every single thing just two really
really tiny amount on the brow bone not
rather either not too close to the is
too delicate to put too much product
around there and then the final part of
my routine I'm going to use the gallon
of a Royale face treatment oil which
lifts and firms and this is a dry oil so
you don't have anything to worry about
if you've got an oily skin like me so
I've just got a little bit of this in my
hands rubbing them together and
massaging it in feels so lovely and
light love it
and now all I've got left to do is brush
my teeth and put on my night cream and
I'm ready fat
and to complete the girl and the pamper
evening although actually charlie is
going to try this one out for me because
he said he wanted eight masks that
wasn't play something a little bit more
nourishing so Charlie's going to try out
the a Bay Royale nourishing no sorry
repairing honey gel masks so let's see
how he gets along with this wait to see
packaging is absolutely beautiful
look at this Hagan I'm Charlie's a bit
worried that you might have seen as
torture in that last clip so if you saw
our sense of sign then then that's why
because his boxes are missing a button
very naughty very naughty
so I'm going to pop my eye cream on now
and recently I've been using the Clarins
multi activist so I'm going to slather
some of this on Charlie is putting on
the gala and honey mask as we speak oh
we try that one out tomorrow I feel like
I've already put so much on my skin it's
not going to give it a little bit a rest
so yeah I'm gonna add this and then I'm
off to bed so thank you guys so much for
