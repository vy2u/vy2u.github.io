vlogmas day 10 so today's vlog is going
to be a come christmas shopping with me
because Charlie and I have come a to
Oxford Street wait you funny is oh so
mean China come to Oxford Street we have
got a bit of a hit list today we've got
the people that we want to shop for
written down and also a few ideas but
there is nothing worse than shopping on
an empty stomach so first of all just
going to meet em and mats for a lovely
lunch at Dicky
you
okay so we finished our lovely lunch and
you can probably tell from our
surroundings but this is the busiest
i've ever seen on some street I think
every single times in the world is here
doing extra shopping today so Charlie I
are now going to add Oxford Street to do
our christmas shopping and the first
portable warm for me is to get something
for my mum and I'm going to go to the
monica vinader store on South Molton
Street and pick up a little something
special and the reason why we're going
today is because they're engraver is
there so I can get whatever I choose
behind grave get it personalized to the
message and also you guys knows i wear
these monica village rings all the time
and i thought that i would treat myself
to a new ring buster so when you guys to
help me decide which ones i'm going to
get the best of all got a battle our way
through each I can you know the first
ever push present I brought universe you
to get that one was an engraved necklace
I going great in this store remember my
years ago I'll find anyone get home and
show you guys
we made it through the crowds to South
Molton Street far less busy here that on
top three you're literally being carried
by the crowd surged it rest oh my god
there's so many lovely shops are you got
brown space okay down here today Google
whistles so many of our favorite shops
but we are just going to go to the
Monica minister and then we might even
go to westfield after this because it's
raining each other and we're here
okay so in the monica vinader store at
the moment encode the perfect time
because the integrator is over there
doing tips being on all the bracelet and
i'm just having a few different designs
and I think I found the one this one is
the signature wide banking or I've been
trying it on with my other bracelets
from monica vinader just make sure you
will go together it's really nice doctor
so they've taken the bracelet downstairs
to do the normal engraving and then I'll
be able to watch the hand engraving
being done in the store so while it gets
engraved I can have a look at some rings
to hopefully get myself a new cluster is
my everyday ring collection
I
so we did it we got the first gift
ticked off the Christmas lists one for
mum so good that they offer the
engraving in the store as well it's not
all the time is only during certain
times like now in the lead up to
christmas so you can check on the
website sorry every Saturday Oh once a
week every Saturday according to Charlie
Sorel knowledge but yeah I'll leave a
link down below to the page on the
website where you can find out more
about it and also we could as you saw
you can see what it's going to look like
with the engraving with the iPad that
they have in the store so it's really
nice to just see how it's going to look
before you actually get it engraved so
now that we've got one ticket off the
list Charlie and I are gonna head to
westfield because it's starting to spit
down with rain and take off a few more
people from our crosses lift okay change
of plans because the weather was so
horrible we don't want to do any more
walking around and we don't want to
leave Dexter for too long so we've just
come in to Selfridges so we're going to
try and take off a few more people on
our Christmas list we've come to the
right company going to try and get
people
for Charlie's family so let's see we can
find so cold and you're saying a word
the ground sand scares us just enough to
think we might still be in love we've
ended up doing the typical thing that
you do on Christmas shopping and and
ended up buying for ourselves they would
have gone for dining new bed dinner
because of new bed linen yeah we've
chosen gray so the decks of hastor come
up on it so much what is it like a hairy
Harry's around Harrison yeah and then
also on this
but I feel like we need two of those
yeah we need one of one other like
another one yes we're using the fact
that its twenty percent off in store
today to go a little bit crazy okay
Charlie and I have parted ways the rest
of the shopping trip he's going to go
home and take all the stuff back spend
some time with Dexter because he's
getting a little bit stressed if not as
 at shopping as iron that's for
sure so this means that I now have the
opportunity to get some bits of gloves
for Charlie and do a stinky bit of
shopping for myself so I've come to the
new handbag section in Selfridges I'm
going to have a sneaky try on a few
nights come back
days
Oh
so
Oh
oh my god guys the amount of people that
come Christmas shopping stage just me to
pick the busiest day of the year to do
my Christmas shopping but I'm up on the
third floor of Selfridges now I've
slightly escape the madness i'm now
heading back into her legs i'm just
going to get up with mental again
I
with
yes
yes
so I'm back to breathing oxford street
and you can probably guess it is
absolutely pouring with rain hence the
bag on my head so i think i'm going to
call it quits and continue the rest of
my christmas shopping online at home in
the comfort of my own home because not
gonna lie it is not too fun
back home again and Charlie's not here
despite the fact that I left Oxford
Street maybe an hour after he did I've
managed to beat him home I got the tube
back but Charlie took the bus back
because of the amount of shopping bags
that he was carrying I think it's safe
to say that he is not gonna be a happy
bunny when he gets home he was already
getting so stressed when we were
shopping that it was a good thing that
he left me in peace because shopping
with the stressed boyfriend is never fun
but yeah so I've just got home back
reunited with my little sausage and I'm
going to carry on my shopping online
because shopping on Oxford Street this
afternoon was just absolute mayhem the
only calm experience was my jewelry
shopping experience in wanaka veneta if
only the rest of the time shopping had
been that stress free I probably would
have stayed out longer and then added to
the fact that it started raining I
thought I'm just going to do a little
bit of shopping at home so still to buy
on my list Charlie I just I don't know
when I was in Selfridges I just kept
getting distracted by handbags my
clothes please tell me if you guys do
this I feel like it's probably not just
me that gets distracted by clothes when
they go shopping but other people so
yeah I think online shopping will have
less distractions so I need to get
something for Charlie I know what I'm
gonna buy my mum other than the bracelet
because she's been hinting for something
for a few weeks now so i'm gonna i'm not
going to say what it is because she's
watching then yeah um yeah getting order
that for my mum and then i'm probably
gonna go on the hamleys website and pick
up some bits and bobs for my nephew's so
let's see what we can find
okay so I'm starting to feel Charlie's
pain when he says that I'm impossible to
buy for I do think as a blogger I am
pretty hard to buy for because when it
comes to beauty or fashion I pretty much
just by so so so much myself and then of
course brands are often very generous
and send things too but now that
Charly's blogging I can totally see why
it's so so hard to buy for a blogger
like I'm looking at watches and Charlie
already has like 500 million watches
that he's been sent to feature on his
Instagram gym clothes he's got a friend
that works at nike's I can't buy him any
gym things and we've kind of said to
each other that we don't want to buy
little knickknacks this year like those
little small stocking fillers because
the house just gets filled with those
kinds of things so I found this on urban
outfitters I feel like this would be a
really good gift for bloggers having
just said what I just heard about
bloggers being really hard to buy for I
think this would make a good stocking
for them not a bad price either
even though I was in the store less than
an hour ago I found my way to the
selfridges website and I think I'm gonna
buy a long schomp large shopper bag for
mutton he's always carrying around so
many bits and bobs whether she's going
to the gym or I don't know just to have
a load of extra things in the car and I
feel like she'd get a lot of use out of
them to be honest while I was in the
store I probably could have picked one
up but it was just so manic in there I
couldn't even think straight so on the
website now I can clearly see all the
different designs in front of me which
is definitely making things easier and
let's see I think I'm going to go for
this beige color I think beige is the
most her color might get a little bit
dirty with the dogs etc but I feel like
there's that wiped clean fabric anyway
so going to treat her to one of those as
well as the jewelry and the other thing
which I'm not saying in this video
because yeah Topsy ok charlie is cooking
downstairs in the kitchen so I just came
up to the bedroom to finish off my
Christmas shopping i got my onion
goggles on cuz I was chopping onions for
the fajitas um but I think it has been a
successful day shopping wise so I've
managed to take off charlie we both kind
of agreed that we're not going to spend
more than 100 pounds on each other we're
going to get some nice stocking fillers
and then put what we would normally put
towards each other presents towards
things for the house because as you guys
know we've been investing in the house a
little bit this year so we're just going
to put gift funds towards house things
like getting our bathroom redone so
ensuite bathroom is looking a little bit
worse where um I've picked up a few
different things in addition to the
bracelet for my mom so I think she's
going to be very pleased with her little
goodies selection but you can't really
go too far for gifts for your mom I
think that yes all they do for us the
least we can do when we're adults is
actually buy really nice gifts so really
please do the bits and bulbs that I've
picked up for mum some really practical
things and then some really
lovely bits and bobs as well I also got
a few things for my niece and then my
nephew's managed to get some things from
like Urban Outfitters they've got some
cool like phone cases and handbag
mirrors and things like that and also
some bits for Charlie from Urban
Outfitters as well what else did I get
um oh when i was browsing i did find a
few things that i quite like the look of
so I popped those on my wish list which
I'll send to mum with a little cheeky
hint hint email so overall a rather
productive shopping a day I would say I
think for the rest of evening Charlie
and I are just gonna chill at home we're
cooking for heaters as we speak and we
were going to go to cinema but because
we've been falling asleep so early
recently we thought we might fall asleep
in the cinema which is rather tragic but
yeah so we're going to watch something
at home instead maybe start wrapping
some of our presents hello mr. sausage
how long you think the dexter yet
although i might have a little look of
lilies kitchen of gaudy gift sets
because need to buy something for our
little chap as well so i think i will
end this log here actually because you
guys have seen Charlie and I chillin in
the house have an evening like so many
times before and I don't think it's
going to be that much different to our
usual tonight so yeah cooking present
wrapping film watching and kissing
Dexter so nothing that you guys haven't
seen before so I'm going to round it off
here thank you guys so so so much for
watching and don't forget that I have
got some gift guides over on my blog so
if my Christmas shopping from today has
inspired you to do your Christmas
shopping if you haven't already then I
will leave those linked down below so
you can see what is on my Christmas wish
list and also my gift guides and also
don't forget about the incredible
personalization and engraving offer up
monica vinader I just think it's such a
lovely way of personalizing a gift and
you guys know how much of a monica
vinader fan I am so to get something
engraved it's just making an already
fabulous present even more incredible
and yeah I think it's a fabulous
fabulous service so i'll leave all the
information about that down in the
description box below if you enjoyed

happy and i will see you in my next one
