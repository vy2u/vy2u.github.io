for a bit of an epic shopping trip and
I've not done a car shopping with me in
quite a while so I thought I would bring
you along with me I say an epic shopping
trip because we're heading it to Oxford
Street on a Thursday morning mum and I
are heading out with the aim of picking
up some nice Christmas gifts and also
just having a bit of a mooch around it's
bright and early
it's 8:30 we're getting in hopefully
before the crowds but I thought I would
show you my outfit of the day before we
head out my outfit today is all chosen
quite tactically so that I have a lot of
movement and hence the she'll a so that
I can just maximise my shopping
abilities let me show you whatever
around today so my shopping outfit for
today lots of layers it is frosty
outside don't if you can see but all
very very chilly I think it's about
minus one at the moment so yes this is
the outfit of the day I've gone for one
of my new Topshop knits which is
probably my favorite jumper at the
moment with a really nice high collar
and or high neckline I have tied my hair
back so I don't need to worry about it
getting in my face and I'm shopping and
then I tried on a few coats but I want
to be able to move around and get to my
purse and things really easily so that's
why I've gone for this juillet faux fur
G late from Reese which I absolutely
adore so snuggly and then of course I
have got a thermal underneath as well
I've got my Reese Carrie chocolate
colored leather leggings love these and
then my Stuart Weitzman over the knee
boots my slippers in the background as
well because these are just quite
stylish
and also very easy to walk in good heel
height for me at least nice chunky heel
accessory wise as always my Michael Kors
access Sophie SmartWatch it's rose gold
so it goes with the rest of the details
on my outfit it also means it'll be very
handy when shopping because I don't need
to keep getting my phone out my bag as
you probably know from my previous
videos this also gets my phone
notifications and Instagram
notifications YouTube excetra etc so I
won't need to keep checking my phone
which is really handy on a busy day like
today and it looks absolutely beautiful
mine's the rose gold with a beautiful
pave detail around the outside also got
my Monica
- Reva ring that I always wear my nails
I got these done in New York and they
are still looking so good I'm really
chuffed with that and then I will show
you my earrings these are my Astrid amel
earrings which I've been loving wearing
a lot recently and the finishing touch
is my Michael Kors handbag this is a
crossbody one so again nice and
practical I can be shopping hands-free
very roomy as well so that is my outfit
of the day it is time to go shopping so
just come into Topshop box for Circus
and I just picked up one of these which
is rather adorable it's a brand I'm not
heard of before called Estella Bartlett
and it's a little kind of travel jewelry
case how cute is that so that make a
very nice little stocking filler
purchase in a morning
so adorable
I think they're such nice stocking
fillers another stocking filler this is
one of those little I think it's got the
microwavable beans inside I think it's
the slot I don't know either way it's
really cute I'm gonna get that for my
knees I hope you're not watching
Courtney so we have made it to
accessories but that's very very similar
colors actually liner the LA has
mastered the layering Sage has got like
a feathery GA on opening leather jacket
we're looking for John Lewis and they've
got monster monster coming up windows
and then you've got a cashmere v-neck on
underneath the prime example of how to
layer blaring four on one we just moved
into Topshop seems you got out the tube
we are now be lining for Selfridges is
our end goal but we're going to go buy a
bit to get some nice new frames for the
love spectacles
so I have been looking for these Zara
faux suede leggings for ages and finally
I have the whole selection here in front
of me in the Oxford Street store now
this is very cute if I still worked in
an office I would 100% get this and the
blacks are so cute in fact I think I
might have to pick this up
we have stopped for a bit of a pit stop
we're both craving a cup of coffee so it
comes to the forest on the roof
restaurant in Selfridges usually it is
really festive up here I've not been up
here for a couple of months maybe like
six months and at the moment it is all
its Hallion kitchen sink it's still nap
time but it's have Italian makeover so
we're going to be having an Italian at
breakfast the la has ordered with
avocado salmon poached eggs and I'm
cabbing then you know which Christmas
snow starts to fall
then you know as Christmas for the
children of the hall then you'll know
it's Christmas Santa's on his way
stand runner Minnesota men it's
Christmas Day
the joyful times we witness for ever
stays Heather sooner fears his resume
and gathers all this frame so after
exploring at Selfridges we have now hit
up the street again if you are not
London or not familiar with London
shopping then basically off Oxford
Street there's a few different streets
that have loads of really lovely shops
on city regions greens have got some of
the big flag ships like the Burberry
Tory Burch might cause that kind of
thing and then there are some smaller
streets as well such as Secret Service
place that's really nice one for little
boo cheeky jewelry shops and places like
Greece and then the street that we're on
now is called South Molton Street this
is one of my favourite Lilla streets
you've got a lush down here Monica
vanilla I think there's still its head
Baker Brown's whistles loads of notes of
love you disposables
and then you know it's Christmas snow
starts to fall
and then you know
as Christmas for the children of the
role then you
it's Christmas
walking around shopping for the past
couple of hours apparently we have
already done 6000 steps so we've done
more than half of our day's recommended
daily allowance just wonderful as you
can see it is getting rather manic it's
only midday but I think we're gonna call
it quits or both feeling a little bit
tired we're going to head home I think
we've done well to the morning picked up
a lot of nice presents so we're gonna
head back home she also has a nice cup
of coffee
and we've just got back home and it is
already getting dark outside it whoa
Dickie
I don't know how to stop these two boys
from jumping off the sofa but they're in
a very very hula Ganic mood aren't you
my monkey um but yeah I thought I would
just quickly show you what I picked up
on Oxford Street I tend to do most of my
shopping online these days so actually I
didn't really buy too much which is good
also in the Black Friday sales I did
pick up quite a few pieces online so I
was trying to restrain myself a little
bit but I got some really nice gifts
while I was out and about I'm not gonna
show you too many of them I think you
did see me talking about this cute
little item while I was in Topshop it's
one of those things where you take like
a bag of beans out of its tummy and
microwave it and I just thought that'd
be a really nice gift for my niece who
is 14 the main shop that I did buy
things from was Zara it wasn't too busy
luckily when we got into town it was
about half-past nine so the shops were
fairly quiet for a Saturday but I picked
up some really nice pieces the first of
which is why is be quiet
I'm sorry you're just gonna have to put
up with the dogs growling in the
background um but the first of which
that I picked up from Zara is this skirt
I have the grey version which I wore so
much in New York I absolutely love it so
comfortable and $25.99 so I saw the
cream version and based on how much I
wear the grey one I thought I would get
a lot of use out of the cream one so
that's the first thing they picked up in
Zara next thing is this jumper dress so
I saw this on the hanger and immediately
be lined for it I think it's stunning I
get so much use out of the gray jumper
dress that I got from
this summer and I also get a lot of use
out of my t-shirt with the pearls that I
picked up from Zara again a few months
ago so I thought this was a bit of a
combination of them both and it's just
really really lovely perhaps if you have
to wear black for work this could be a
really nice option as a work dress as
well with black tights black ebony boots
would be a really really lovely style
then we have a pair of black leggings
it's really picking up a lot of black
pieces at the moment which is quite
unusual for me as you'll know if you've
been watching my channel for a while but
these are quite classic leggings very
comfortable with some hanging pearls on
the hem I actually bought these as
trousers to wear on our flights we're
going to the Maldives in 12 days and I
thought these would be really
comfortable but also quite stylish to
wear on the airplane of course because
they are a legging material they're
pretty stretchy so they should be very
comfortable for a long-haul flight and
then I showed you these in the store the
suede effect leggings that I've been
trying to find in Zara so long I finally
found them these are a chocolatey brown
color and then they also have a bit of a
biker kind of patch like a reinforcement
area on the knee which I think it's
quite a nice style so I feel like these
will be a piece that I do get a lot of
use out of over the next few weeks and
months throughout the winter season I've
just got a text from my mama to say that
she is home and my watch also brings up
my whatsapp notifications as well as my
Instagram Twitter YouTube basically all
the apps on my phone I get up here but
the one thing I find probably the most
useful is my water's up notifications
sometimes when you're out and about like
if you're shopping you hear your phone
ding you don't want to have to rummage
through your bag you can just quickly
glance at your wrist and you can see who
is messaging you and if it's urgent or
not so that is very very useful no no
that girl bit you monkey let go
oh my god stop it
okay slight distraction aside the last
bit that I picked up from Zara is this
ginormous scarf
I had a Zara scarf last year and they're
so big and so cozy it was just one of
those pieces I was so thankful for on so
many occasions it's absolutely
gianormous and so soft that's how I
picked up from Zara so I think I'm going
to end the video here I doing this to
turn into a mega long one so thank you
so much for watching I do have another
Christmas shopping day plan so let me
know if you'd like to see a specific
Christmas shopping video and I will do
that because I absolutely loved filming
my shopping trip today but yeah thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
