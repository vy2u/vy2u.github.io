hi guys welcome back to my channel so
today's video is going to be a come
travel with me video all about my flight
home with Etihad from Abu Dhabi to
London because this is pretty much going
to be the most amazing journey that I
ever take I think because we've started
off in Abu Dhabi Airport coming in to
the Etihad first-class lounge so
normally with a business-class ticket
you don't actually get access to this
lounge but because we are traveling as
guests of Etihad we've got to experience
this fantastic lounge so I'm gonna give
you guys a little tour of the lounge now
the facilities here are absolutely
incredible we just had a fantastic
breakfast I had poached eggs on a potato
fritter and I had fresh orange juice
cappuccino and the breakfast menu was
very expensive so many different options
you can have a five-course lunch dinner
you can have champagne whatever you want
but I just stuck to my poached eggs on
potato fritter um in the first-class
lounge there's a gym there's a spike and
get your nails done you can get your
hair done you can get a blow-dry you can
get yourself shaved you can have a
shower there's a games room a gym so
many facilities here it really is taking
care of every need that you could
possibly have so that's the first-class
lounge we're going to head through the
airport now to board our plane which
having in business class but if you saw
my previous video you can have a full
tour of the Airbus a380 which includes a
look around the residence which is a
3-bedroom cabin and the first-class
Suites as well so I'll leave that video
link down below if you want to have a
proper tour of the airplane but for now
our flight gate is just opened so
mid-game
My Week which is just rather fabulous
and I'll show you a few of my in-flight
essential got obviously my laptop got
tripods I control my pamper routine
later and then I've got my in-flight
toiletries my liquids are in another
Andy homage back inside
my liquids are in this one clear
container and then I've got my beauty
products in this one as well also got my
samsung wireless
these are really good Sam always
counseling and a wireless link works my
phone and my laptop
and then I've also got my leggings which
are just the compass things in the
Diezel auntie's taking off and I can go
into the bathroom and get champagne fees
and calls per sec or whatever thank you
very much thank you so this is where my
in-flight beauty routine begins and I'm
starting by taking off my makeup in my
little bag I've got a mini Bioderma my
solar water and then I've got a packet
of calm pads which I think I took from a
hotel at one point but it's definitely
the best way of taking off makeup on the
plane because you don't need water you
don't need to leave your seat but it
still does a really good job of cleaning
the makeup away and cleansing the skin
too and I've got this really handy Paul
and Joe mirror which I got from ASOS
it's so big absolutely love it and it's
perfect for traveling so that's
definitely one of my travel essentials
the next thing that I'm doing is
applying a serum this is a Clinique
anti-aging serum to be honest
I would apply any serum but I just
happen to have this really handy travel
size one of those so I'm just patting
that in as the first step and then I'm
using a Sarah Chapman skin esis
under-eye cream and this one is really
moisturizing I do find that my under
eyes do need a little bit more attention
than the average under-eye area so yeah
that's a really good one
then I probably should have done this
first but I only just remembered I'm
using the Dettol antibacterial hand gel
this is a really good one and again it
doesn't smell offensive only things
that's really great and then my favorite
part of the routine I'm using this dar
fan facial oil this is a rose oil I got
this in the November Birchbox
it is such a luxurious product and I
love using that on the plane and the
label around a hot flannel so I just
used that on my face and chest
in this little moody pot I've got some
older soil and I find that by rubbing
this on my chest and on my pulse points
it just helps to clear the sinuses and I
think it prevents you from getting any
colds that you might pick up from the
airplane then I'm putting on some really
moisturizing and nourishing knit balm
this is the nukes Rev de miel as really
a cult product so absolutely love that
and then finally I'm taking some temple
spa body balm and this is just like a
calming balm I'm not finding this a
little bit more have a bit of champagne
I'm using the OP tracks I missed this
one is great because you don't need to
use it like normal drops you just spray
it on the general eye area and then I
used a tux hand cream to finish
so great thing
not racist
great thank you
I've got my wine to go with my tomato
analysis
finish this she will bring out my main
course which
and king
my nan who is something that auntie
cattle very proud
which I'm guessing is a mistake and see
the wine manager chooses the wine each
season depending
where the airplane is coming from and
going to
yes sir
for the king
around against mine
claiming to a Seminole wine tastes
different at different altitudes because
of a taste buds change
so we have 20% less reactive tastebuds
develop in the air I think I'm currently
36,000 feet so this wine hopefully
they've done a good job shouldn't taste
too different I should taste on the
ground if they chose ours let's go
with magic
the gun
and we are back in the surprisingly
sunny UK although it is pretty chilly
this Uniqlo jacket has proved to be a
very good purchase it just crumbles up
into nothing so good travel companion if
you have not got one I highly recommend
them so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
flying with me and thank you Eddie had
for the most fabulous journey that
aeroplane is the smoothest thing in a
whole world I didn't even realize we'd
landed it was so smooth it makes me
wonder how something that join one was
in flight so smoothly so yeah I just
waiting for my uber so I really hope you
enjoyed this vlog and my other album
Debbie's log so I will leave all of them
links down below so you've got a daily
blog about first couple of days doing
touristy things in Abu Dhabi then you've
got a come shopping with me blog at all
of the air bus so if you want to have a
little bit more information about
playing it we just flew on check out the
private tour video because that's a
pretty cool one so yeah not long until
my next trip actually less than 48 hours
until I'll be on an aeroplane again so
make sure you're subscribed if you don't
want to miss any of my troubles and let
me know if you'd like me to film
something slightly different on the next
if there's anything else slightly
different that I can do while I'm away
then let me know your ideas because you
know that really really helps me out
yeah you guys enjoyed this video give it
a thumbs up if you did and I will see
you very very soon in my next one I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
