here in Abu Dhabi and I thought I would
do another vlog because excuse my wet
hair by the way I actually got out the
shower to come here because mum and I
are here at yeah mall and I just
suddenly thought I would do a come
shopping with me zone because I've never
done one of these in a foreign country
quite interesting so yeah we are staying
while we've been here and up with others
and staying in the hotel the young
Viceroy
so this mall is pretty much our closest
shopping center and it's our final night
here in Abu Dhabi so we go shopping this
little I have been recommended by quite
a few people to go in so I'm very
excited to see what kind of stores are
inside looks absolutely ginormous so
yeah hopefully you guys will enjoy
coming shopping with me a little bit
different to my usual London shopping
trips and already the surroundings are
totally different we just parked in the
luxury car park only in Abu Dhabi that
you have a luxury car park and behind me
in that way
that is Ferrari roles so this shopping
center is on the Formula One young
marina racetrack
this is all very car focus but Ferrari
world is out the journal versus like
like a theme park with a rollercoaster
very thrill
so we oh it looks like we're going into
Ferrari well in order to into the mall
yeah
so you almost have to walk through
Ferrari well to get the shopping wall
mom and I aren't going to actually go in
but this is like every teenage boy's
dream come true here where Ari's
everywhere you're coming with your
brother or your boyfriend or your dad
you can leave them in Ferrari wells
while you go shopping
Oh
you
Oh
feels a little bit like we're in a
ginormous American shopping mall we've
just been into candalyn where I made my
first purchase I definitely could have
found this in the UK that I've been
looking to this backstop for so long I
thought I have to turn to grab it while
it was there in front of me
the yet Barton Body Works like they have
I've only ever seen those in American
sports and oh they have that here to my
right in Debenhams
pretty much like the British High Street
and then they also have a Zara that mum
and I nipped into a second ago American
Eagle and American Eagle teen sort of
looking here yeah it's like a mixture of
England America everywhere it I think
this is without the biggest shopping
mall I have ever been in and I've been
some pretty humongous ones in America
every single angle there's about three
floors you can see the Escalade behind
me there's a huge long road shop stuff
there
it's like an absolute maze and shops and
from literally all over the world
there's British high street got a boots
right behind me at Starbucks body shop
House of Fraser and then you've got al
Jabar opticians and all the Arabic ones
I go somewhere arash of Nadia from
saying that right such a mash-up between
different countries got Spanish ones
Stradivarius Vera Moda it's like all the
world's shops in one ginormous shopping
center
I have to wonder why the mannequins are
wearing coats and jumpers when it's 40
degrees outside but hey
Wow
me
make
friends idea
friend right here
Nik
I think this may just be the best
pistachio ice cream that Leela and I
have ever tried would you agree
you
you
you
so we're now going to try and find our
way out of this maze of a shopping
center haven't really got any idea how
long we've been in here they're doing
all the typical tricks of the mall where
they don't have any windows need at how
many clocks so you just completely lose
all sense of time my hair has turned
into an afro as you can see gained all
the frizz from the humidity and we
didn't you buy too much I just bought
the two things I showed you earlier the
Hollister an American Eagle fluffy
tracksuit bottoms which I'm going to
wear on the fly at home and you Karen
Millen top so nothing too exciting to
report there might administer for NEX
we've seen a few Google shopping bags
but this place is so dining almost we
don't really stand a chance of finding
it I think we're going to call it a day
and head out a little bit tired and
hungry so I'll catch up with you if and
when we ever find our way out of
so we are now at the Yas Marina and
hopefully we're going to find somewhere
nice to have some dinner here I
completely forgot how roasting it is a
our taxi driver was absolutely mental he
was joking about driving like a Formula
One driver we do not approve
after another very unhealthy meal we are
now walking back to the hotel after
shopping and dinner at the Yas Marina
and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
very short mini blog probably wasn't as
exciting as I thought it might have been
didn't buy too much yeah if you enjoyed
looking around more with me certainly
very different shopping experience in
the UK although a lot of the same shops
but that globalization for you so yeah
thank you so much for watching and check
out tomorrow's video which will be my
last I would have e1 and that is going
to be my journey home so I'm going to
show you what it's like traveling
business cars in the a380 because we've
been told that we're getting upgraded
which is very exciting and my in-flight
pamper routine so keep a lookout for
that I'm going to try and publish it
really really quickly
so hope you can see that tomorrow so
yeah hope you've enjoyed the Abydos
looks and next time I travel somewhere
it's not too far away so if you got any
guesses as to where I'm going and let me
know in the comments I'll give you a
clue it is a very hot place so yes very
exciting anyway thanks for watching and
I'll see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
