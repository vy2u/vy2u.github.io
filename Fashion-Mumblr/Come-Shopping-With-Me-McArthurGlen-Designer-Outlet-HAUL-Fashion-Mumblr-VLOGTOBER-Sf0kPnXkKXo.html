first vlog of October so I have decided
that I'm going to do blocked over and I
thought yeah I know Charlie doesn't like
it when I vlog every day thanks the
doesn't like it
Dexter loves it but anyway I thought um
my first vlog I would take you shopping
with me because my last shopping video
you guys seem to really really like and
today we have come to the MacArthur Glen
outlets in yogurt north and we are here
to do a little bit of shopping and today
especially I want to just keep a lookout
for some autumn essentials so classic
bits and bulbs to add to my Ulta Mord
robe I always have to decapitate you
when I'm walking chopped I'll have it so
come up to the York MacArthur glam and
they've got I think six outlets across
the UK this one is a pretty big one it
was only two hours from London so not
too hard to get to and they've got a
white shirt bar here Brooks Brothers
which is just here behind me so we're
going to go into here first which is a
very cool it's like an American shark
which they've converted six with an
American truck which then converted
another way really really cool and so
we're going to go in there and have a
little look at their white shirts which
is just classic autumn essential
everybody has to have a nice white shirt
for that autumn wardrobe so we're going
to go and have a look try some shirts on
and that's pretty much my starting point
for building my autumn wardrobe
so come inside the truck we are
surrounded by a lot of different white
shirts which is pretty much what Brooks
Brothers known for they're the epitome
of white shirt retailers lot of
beautiful designs what are you going to
go for dyeing favorites you can't be
wrong with their white house and show
can you know everyone needs at least two
literally I think you look very stylish
just the classic white shirt on I'm your
lip something a little bit more unusual
I've seen a ruffle design which I rather
like the look of okay so Charlie's found
one that you rather liked the look of
I'm going to go into the shop in the
main model because they've got a few
more women's styles in there I've got
something pretty specific in my mind
that I want to pick up but yeah such
good value these shirts are up to 60%
off the retail price which is pretty
insane I think the one that I liked was
over 100 down to 60 something it's a
really good value then we're going to go
and explore inside
by
first purchase of the day done and
Charlie and I know we're getting college
because what are we excited about buying
darling homework Oh matter is a heading
to the cruise a find ourselves
you
but Jesus
from in the fitting room in Ted Baker
very big luxurious baking room or gosh
it's like small mirrors in here and I am
just so amazed by these prices to start
with everything's like I'd say up to 60%
of our show prices also this whole shop
does not feel like an outlet in the
slightest
everything's size order they have
current season that staff which is
normally like my bug fare when I come
out of the showcase or does not current
season I was going to buy this jump in
the shop and it's now down 100 pounds
after 60 pounds this is definitely
coming with me I'm just pretty much in
love with this jumper Finch I'm gonna
play more bits and bobs well Charlie has
found the coat of his dreams know both
doing it very well in Ted Baker just
call me how nice the store is like it
feels like I'm on Oxford Street
beautiful
a very successful shopping trip so far
I've just picked it up and they'll be
taught from breathe in to infer yes just
like the instructor and back one on the
street which is so nice and they have my
side normally when I go to outfit they
just don't have any small sizes to stop
got a bargain time Baker Avenue what do
we get a blue peacoat so tiny already
owns this coat biking fought against
it's not exactly the same
it's going to be community there's no
post on winter coats including one spot
chinnu get out right now so yeah I
picked up your top from greed and also a
jumper which is when we try it on in Ted
Baker both of which I'm at these
thrilled with and
we are going to do a little bit more
shopping but there's a men's race as
well which are going to pop into Charlie
French Connection here on my left I
think that is our next stop
major success in French Connection I
just picked up a jumper that I was going
to buy on Oxford Street the other day 70
pounds and I just got it for 39 which is
just ridiculous I feel like I've just
saved so much money and they were also
telling us that sometimes stores have
special offers on that for students so
Ted Baker got one on at the moment where
students get extra 20% off so you're
practically making money by coming shop
here it is insane that's my register on
it anyway they've got a really nice mix
of kind of like high street and higher
end stores got Michael Kors here I don't
think they'd let me film in there but
I'm going to go and see if I can fly any
nice and leather good use
Oh
you
they have the most insane sale going on
and now on top of the outlet prices they
have 30% off I didn't I didn't buy
anything because I'm being very good and
I have treated myself to you know who
recently but yeah but it's a lot of the
outlet prices so some of these bags had
over 150 pounds off as mental where
we're going down upstairs now we're
going to go and grab some lunch because
I can't shop around empty stomach
and
feeling very full after lunch Charlene I
went up to work mamas they have a few
different restaurants up here on the top
floor and I went for a fairly healthy
option got chicken teriyaki what do you
have darling a tuna tuna tuna and quinoa
and healthy very good and then I also
treated myself to a cookies and cream
Froyo with chocolate egg and gummy bears
because a little bit more energy for our
last bit of shopping okay home again
that room next door is really really
messy so I thought I would sit in my
office to just show you the bits and
bobs I picked up today because I can't
go shopping and not show you what I
picked up so welcome to my office I'm
going to just quickly run through the
bits and bobs in my shopping bags I know
you came shopping with me so you did see
a few bits and bobs I thought be nice to
just show you officially so I will start
with my first purchase which was from
the knife shop and I picked up this gray
I think you'd probably call it a running
jumper and that I just saw this a really
handy for outdoor exercises in the
wintertime when it gets a little bit
colder I've been looking for something
like this for a little while ever since
I went to Devon we were doing some
outdoor walking and biking and I thought
I needed something like this so this was
60 pounds down to 42 so I saved 18
pounds which is really really good it's
got some really nice design details it's
got little zippy pocket you can put some
money in there
and it's also a thermal top so good for
layering so I think I'll get a lot of
use out of this in autumn and winter
then as you saw we went to Brooks
Brothers which is the reason why I came
was to pick up a beautiful white shirt
ooh really classic item and as you saw I
picked up this really stunning one with
the ruffles along the neckline so this
is just a white shirt ooh classic white
shirt with a bit of a feminine edge so I
would definitely be getting a lot of use
out of this I think I can team something
like this you can make it really classic
with a pair of high-waisted jeans or a
slightly unusual pair of jeans like the
oxford curd ones I was wearing today but
I also think this would look really
lovely with a pencil skirt just so many
different ways you can style up a white
shirt it really is a wardrobe essential
and Brooks Brothers are just like the
classic shirt creators so really really
pleased with that purchase and this one
was 109 down to 60 so amazing amazing
discount that is 40% discount yeah I've
already spent which is just so good and
a real investment piece as well because
it's not going to go out of style
anytime soon I also went into Reese I
don't think I showed you what I picked
up from Reese but I'm really really
pleased with this purchase the whole
Reese shop was really fabulous it was
not old stock at all it was current
season so I went a little bit crazy when
I was looking around for the stock in
there but I did only buy one thing also
it's just beautifully wrapped as though
I bought it from a normal school so you
don't lose out on the in-store
experience by shopping in the outlet
which I love so I got this beautiful
blouse it's just such a classic blouse I
used to have this in pretty much every
color I had a gray one a white one a
black one a blue one when I used to work
at Reese but I never had the pink one
and this is a really lovely kind of
apricot salmon pink with the salt look
absolutely gorgeous with some white
jeans you've got these gold buttons down
the back which just a really lovely
design detail and this was 80 pounds
down to 53 so again a really really good
discount and it's something that doesn't
really go down in sale in the shops
because it's such a classic so a really
good way of picking this up
a fraction of the high street price then
we went into French Connection and I had
a little look around and nothing really
caught my eye and then as I was waiting
for Charlie to come into the store
I spotted actually somebody else holding
us up and when she put it down I made a
beeline for it because I had seen this
in the Oxford Street store and really
wanted to get it but it was just
slightly too expensive for me so as soon
as I saw it obviously I just ran for it
this in the shops she's taken the label
off strangely but it was 70 pounds in
the shops and I got it for 39 pounds
which is just so good for a French
Connection jumper and this is the kind
of thing I will wear it so much over the
coming months it's got a really lovely
almost batwing style sleeve just a
really classic
gray and white design so looking forward
to wearing this one you'll be seeing
this on my Instagram and in loads of
blogs to come no doubt and then Ted
Baker is the most massive carrier bag
that's mostly because of Charlie's
purchase Charlie bought this coat which
he had the version last year but he said
it's gone bobbly so he bought himself a
new one and this one was $2.99 down to
179 so for Ted Baker coat he saved
himself over 120 pounds and they had
they had so much stock normally when we
go to outlets he really struggles to
find his size but there were just so
many sizes this shirts jackets Blazers
so really really good wonderful guys and
also for girls once again I was just
amazed that the stock was all current
season and good sizes as well
you saw me trying this on of course I
picked this up I just can think of so
many ways I want to style this in coming
months so you'll be seeing a lot of this
one oh and this was 99 which to honest I
would not have paid 99 pounds on this I
loved it but I wouldn't have spent a
hundred pounds on it down to 60 which is
not cheap sheet but for a Ted Baker
jumper I'm very very happy to spend 60
pounds and I'm really pleased with that
discount and then another shop that we
made purchases from was la Cruz a but if
I'm completely honest the bag was really
heavy and I didn't want to bring it
upstairs but we picked up a griddle pan
for our steaks a pan
fabric holders it's not too hot on your
hands a pink ramekin and a muffin tray
the muffin tray was down from 50 to 25
pounds and it's got a lifelong guarantee
so a good home investment which is just
typical for me and Charlie we just tend
to buy all these practical things as
well so overall I would say a very
successful day at MacArthur Glen in York
really lovely to see the Brooks Brothers
pop up as well which is going to be at
York for two weeks as of the 28th of
September and then it's doing a little
tour so if you want to go and find
yourself a perfect white shirt you can
go and find the van all the informations
on the website leader down below and
yeah it's gonna be touring around the
six centers in the UK really wonderful
day very productive lots of wonderful
bargains and now I'm pretty much just
going to have some dinner and do some
work so I think I'll end this vlog here
as I mentioned it is the first over vlog
Tovar I'm in Greece at the moment as

pre film this so that I would definitely

past by watching this video so give this
