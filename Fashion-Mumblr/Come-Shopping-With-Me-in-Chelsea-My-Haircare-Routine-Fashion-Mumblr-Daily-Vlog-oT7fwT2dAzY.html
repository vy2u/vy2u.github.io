another day in the life blog it's just
one of those gray really autumnal rainy
days and contrary to popular belief as a
blogger do not spend these kind of days
in our pajamas doing nothing I'm really
determined that despite the horrible
weather I'm going to have a really
really productive day today so kicking
it off with a session at the gym got my
gym kit on and I thought I would vlog as
well cuz I'm actually going to go
shopping later and hit up Oxford Street
I haven't been real shopping in quite
some time I've done quite a lot of
online shopping you guys probably saw
all my halls on my channel last week but
I just wanted to see what's in the shops
because it's a very strange time of year
when no one really knows what to buy we
have days like this and then we have
really hot sunny days like yesterday was
boiling so it's a bit of strange time so
I thought I would take you shopping with
me a little bit later but before that
I've got tons of life admin to do and
quite a lot of blog posts I want to
write have got quite a little videos to
edit I thought I'd do a daily vlog it's
going to be quite a quite a varied day
but first we're going to show you what I
take in my gym bag because um shower is
actually not working at home or it does
but we don't have any hot water so I'm
going to be having a very pampering
session at the gym so so I've got all my
pampering that's involved in this little
bag this is a really handy bag because
it's kind of waterproof it's from a
brand called L oql I think by or girls
Amazon or something but it's great it
dries really quickly so you stick in the
shower it stays dry or it dries really
quickly I am taking my current favorite
shampoo and conditioner mix I say
conditioner I do have the conditioner
from this range it's the catwalk by TG
range and in particular their oatmeal
and honey I hope I'm going to soak this
word right r1 and Miele its range is
specifically designed for dry hair that
really needs a bit of repairing so as
you go into autumn everything I find it
needs a little bit more love and care so
it's really good range to use for that
I'm actually working with TG on a couple
of things in the next few months so
you'll be seeing me talking about them a
lot
more and I'm very happy to working with
them because for me too usually is a
brand that okay so when I was about
sixteen seventeen when I first started
getting my hair colored and I didn't
really go about it the right way but my
hair was just boy so so noted in such
bad condition like on a field at
breaking point it was pretty much
falling out it's so bad and I could not
get a brush through it every time I wash
my hair it was a traumatic experience in
fact the only shampoo and conditioner
range I could use was by TG and it was
their urban anecdotes level 3 which was
the red one not only did it smell
amazing but it was the only conditioner
that I could use that actually enable me
to brush through my hair so I've always
been very thankful to TV for that so
very happy to working with them and this
is a range amusing at the moment really
like the packaging it's very cool and
it's appropriate for colored hair which
is very important because obviously this
is not my natural color I'll be taking
the deep mask and I'll just leave this
on my hair while I exfoliate while I
cleanse etc etc and then I've also got
the shampoo from the same range which of
course I'll use before that also really
like this range especially into taking
to the gym because it means I don't have
to take all my aftercare products with
me so this has heat protectant within it
so it means I don't have to spray my
hair with another product which means I
have left a take in my gym bags I will
blow dry and maybe straighten my hair at
the gym as well as well as my shampoo
and conditioner I'm taking my lash and
lid foaming cleanser from Nuvo lashes
because I had their extend done the
other day I think that's what it's
called and when they put individual
lashes glued onto your eyelashes so
really good for my upcoming holidays we
means that I have to a mascara but you
can't use your normal cleanser because
anything with oil in could break the
bonds between the lashes and your lashes
and this is their specific daily foaming
cleanser for your lashes what else can
we get in here I've got my eyes nourish
and smooth oatmeal scrub and mask oh but
I realized it as a mask as well in that
case what I'll probably do oh yeah you
can leave it on for 5 to 7 minutes ok
I'll be doing that have a prophet pamper
maybe I can do that while my intense
nourishing mask it does its job what
else what else do I have in here
this is one of my favorite cleansing
balms it is the MS Pro collagen
cleansing balm this whole range I
absolutely love you saw in my last vlog
I use a secret to get a new LMS cocoa
drink room and it worked so a big big
fan of that whole range got my other
razor for obvious reasons
yeah oh and this is my body scrub CNX
superfine so that I can fake tan
afterwards so as well as my toiletry bag
I've got wet brush which I find is just
the best kind of brush especially when
your hair is wet because this guy's
knows when your hair is wet is at its
most fragile so you have to be super
super careful with what you do with your
hair no rough howling etc so using a wet
brush is just a real gentle way of
brushing it so you don't get any
breakage or as much breakage also in
there I have my beats by dr. dre ear
foam they are the big over ear ones but
i still find them really good before in
the gym because it means you can kind of
like leave your phone somewhere and then
walk around do different weights etc
without worrying about any wires and
last but not least in my gym bag I have
got a cozy change of clothes this is a
jewels jumper that I kindly sent it to
me last year and I wear it so so so much
I'm going to wear this and comfy jeans
for the rest of the day after the
workout just so that I can be super
super productive that noise I think
means with Charlie's out the shower
which means it's time to go
just got back home from the gym and I
was a really really good session we did
legs and they are already burning so I'm
definitely feeling that tomorrow I feel
nice and pampered had a lovely shower
actually so I have a hot shower and yeah
exfoliators deep cleanse my hair with
the catwalk ypg mask and my hair
actually if you have got bleached hair
you'll know how much of a big deal it is
if you can actually brush it without
having to put detangling conditioner in
and I managed to brush her at no problem
so very happy with that smells amazing
the oatmeal and honey as you can see the
honey just smells incredible so yeah
it's a little bit rough at the moment
because I just rough dried at the gym
but I'm going to add even more shine and
smoothness by blow drying it properly
now it is actually now it's sunny
outside and if you can see by the
brightness out there but I'm going to
film a few videos today so what my head
is looking extra lovely and I'll show
you a few of the styling products that I
like to use to like keep it looking good
all day and then I'll probably give it
another little top up later on in the
day for Charlie 9 after dinner okay so I
just put you guys up on a tripod so that
I can actually show you what's going on
but because I'm going to be filming all
day and want my hair to be better than
usual I'm going to be using a rootless
spray this is the catwalk by TG rootless
spray is called the root boost spray for
lift and texture so I'm going to be
sectioning off my hair and applying it
to the roots and then any volume that I
create with my blow-dryer
this will help to just keep it in place
3 maximize a lot to maximize the volume
and just give me a better head a so
starting off just by gently brushing it
through
and now in its sections
I can pray this my hair probably like
80% dry at the moment and this is kind
of wet so you have to blow-dry it in
going this route area so you can see
that I made my hair a little bit more
damp it shouldn't be wet those you
probably put a little bit too much on
but it's more damp and already you can
see that any volume that I create just
kind of stays that when my kit now is
feral brush blow-dryer basically just
going to give myself a normal blow-dry a
little bit more focus on cracking
exfoliant okay so as you can see that
has given my hair a major major boost of
volume on the roots and I've got a lot
of hair it's fine but because it's so
much it's pretty heavy so what I
sometimes find is that if I style my
hair it's been ages styling it and then
an elevator I look in the mirror and
it's gone flat but by using a root boost
like this one I just find that it helps
my style favor luminous longer which
you're going to be filming videos all
day and then going out shopping going
out for dinner I definitely want to keep
my start as long as possible I'm going
to put some curls in this in a few
minutes but Charlie's shouting me
because Beckford is ready so don't have
my own Carlton
right back upstairs now after a lovely
breakfast and I finally put some makeup
on I need to start filming I'm going to
use and when I've not used in a long
time my curling wand I turn on because I
want to try and get just slightly bigger
higher up waves today so let's see how
we do it I have Sam's so impressed of
how soft my hair feels the bleach tab is
Neven
ah Dickie what are you doing oh just
turn around Dickens with wing on the new
carpet so sorry about that little
interval on the plus side that color
looks rather good yes I'm just wrapping
it around the barrel holding it for like
six or seven seconds and then when I let
it drop I just hold it as a curl for a
few seconds and then this is when the
hair cools down so it should help the
curl a bit longer all right so obviously
my curls are a little bit too tight at
the moment but I'm just going to leave
them like this for about five minutes
I'm going to get changed finish my
makeup etc leave them to cool down and
then I will brush them through just for
stop forming okay all changed and nearly
ready to start filming I just have to
cookie tell you about my latest lip
obsession and not normally if you tram
at anything glossy or sticky but this is
the Too Faced melted latex liquefied
high shine lipstick and I am at sea in
love with it I've got the shade hopeless
romantic and noticing the color is
beautiful and it's such a like strong
color for a gloss so yeah big fan of
that final step with my hair so as I
mentioned the curls have now cooled down
I'm going to brush through them which is
going to give them a much softer effect
and I'm going to finish off with the
kettle quite Gigi work it hairspray so
what I really like about this one is it
gives re flexible hold so you don't have
any stiff curls it just doesn't really
look like your hairspray and at all but
it does makin style lasts a lot longer
and this is actually also the one that I
use when I do a more sleek hairstyle so
more often than not I go out with my
hair in a ponytail especially for a day
of meetings and just to prevent those
flyaway hairs or any frizz I just missed
my hair really finely all over with this
and then to turn away any frizziness
that's a really good one fact it's so
lightweight it does give a really good
hold first of all as fresh fruit cup
Chansey
okay so just as those about to do the
big hair reveal my memory cards whistles
I just have to change my memory card um
but yeah as you can see really big curls
almost like a Hollywood curl style and
these will drop a tiny bit throughout
the day but I'm going to do what I can
to keep them in place as long as
possible so as I search the fine mist of
hairspray not too close you just want us
to be really kind of Airy you can feel
it a little bit in the hair that's the
hair texture doesn't really change too
much and also smells like perfume as
well else do you love it so pleased with
how this has turned out perfect for an
afternoon of filming I always feel so
much better when I'm having a good hair
day when I'm filming so yeah I'm going
to film a video or two maybe even three
leave a comment down below if you have
already figured out which video I filmed
on this day because the video that I'm
about to film already realized that
makes sense
and yeah leave me a comment if you
figured out but I am going to go film
and I'll catch up with you guys and it
comes out of time
okay it's a few hours later now it's
actually half-past four now and I'm so
optimistic as to how much I can get done
today
I think the last time I spoke to you
it's like midday and I was like yeah I'm
gonna film two or three videos and I'm
going to go and get my vlogger mail and
then I'm going to go into town and go
shopping and then go to an event and
then go to dinner
no that wasn't it's not going to happen
so dinner tonight choice book does
because basically it's national burger
de una casa days and Charlie wants to do
a blog post about the best burgers in
town so we are going to the Big Easy
restaurant on Kings Road tonight to try
a burgers
slash pig out and and he's booked the
table for seven so I do still really
want to go shopping today I'm going to
go to Kings Road I'm going to get the
bus in about half an hour's time as you
just saw I had to tidy up after filming
two videos I got two videos done today
which means I'm going to have to do full
tomorrow and we have got the Builder guy
come around tomorrow so it should be fun
but yes never mind I can just have a
super productive day tomorrow yeah I
tidied up after two of the holes and
then I undid a bit of blogger mail we
just got back from doddle and so I'll
show you some of the highlights the
first thing was the most beautifully
scented blogger mail I think I've ever
been sent and it was from Miss Dior
first of all they've sent some cookies
in here I will just open it up and show
you
and they sent three little cookies which
are very symbolic of the fragrance and
I'm so excited to eat them with my cup
of tea because all I've had today is
avocado on toast which not filling
enough after gym session I'm going to
Bower that and then estee lauder
oh the main thing that deal sent was a
new perfume not forgetting that this is
misdeal Oda possum and if it smells
anything like what the blogger Mel smelt
like then it's just incredible I
actually spritz for myself with it a few
moments ago and then went downstairs and
Charlie said he thought it was lovely
that's a good sign and actually it is
really beautiful it's not only beautiful
to look at but very feminine fragrance I
think this is a music for misty also
very excited to keep on wearing that
hand to get any more perfume religious
conference then I got new launches very
kindly posted to me from Estee Lauder
this one I'm very excited about it's a
new double wear cushion BB cream in its
SPF 50 which is amazing and we don't
wanna be forgetting about our SPF just
because it's kind of the end of summer
and love is packaging a little gold lid
pop it open you do something dumb and
then you've got this mirrored compact
with a sponge and underneath here which
I'm yes there we go
sponge want a wall underneath you've got
the product which is the cushion
foundation which I love I love having
cushion foundations in my handbag I
really like the Maybelline one and the
L'Oreal one but there's just something
extra luxurious about getting something
like this out of your handbag and they
also sent me a new mascara a new grocery
I stick to very generous from sm
daughter and I got a really random
blogger mail which contained a astronaut
and astronaut ice cream sandwich which
I'm going to give to my nephew who's
four in a bit but probably like age
limitations on it I'll make sure that I
over see him eating it I don't know yeah
I'm going to give it to him at the
weekend I think he will get a lot more
entertainment out of that than I will
but very cool little gift to the blogger
mail so yeah I'm going to carry on
tidying up now I'm going to start
putting some things aside for our trip
because we're going to Siena
next week so get and pop some bits aside
for that and then just get ready to head
out and go shopping on Kings Road okie
dokie so we are just getting ready to go
out quick shop on Kings Road and then
head out for dinner so I thought I'd
show you briefly how I'm going to update
my hair for tonight so luckily I still
have lots of volume in there so I think
I'm going to do a performance kind of
ponytail and then make it really sleek
with the hairspray so as you can see
we've got a lot of volume going on and
but personally I can't eat with my hair
down I just find it really
claustrophobic so what I'm going to do
is
and tie it up in a high ponytail add a
bit of volume of the roots and then just
make it look super chic okay so step one
is creating a high ponytail just in a
normal way normally when I do a ponytail
I would use an invisible ball but
because I want this one to really stay
in place I'm just going to use a normal
blood colored hair bubble so I'm doing
it fairly high so faster normal and what
I'm going to do is just bring a bit of
that volume back in just by kind of
pushing it at the base here I'm just
pulling different areas just to create a
bit more volume at the roof and now I
want to get rid of the hair bubbles what
I'm going to do is take a little bit or
hair from underneath the ponytail quite
a long bit if your hair layered just to
play around till you get this quite long
I've got this bit here I'm going to
Kirby grip and I'm going to wrap this
bit of hair around the hair bubble and
then secure with my grip okay so now you
cannot see my hair ball which is exactly
what I wanted I just pulled a few
strands down for my ears I don't want
this to be too sharp and then so that
the bits wrapped around my head and come
loose I'm just going to give it one more
spritz with the hairspray
and then I'm going to finish by missing
the half rate all over and how to keep
in place before threat will be evening
and that is my DIY voluminous ponytails
so that further do a lot of cool
shopping right we have made it to Kings
Road very antisocial shopping partner
with me dissolve how do you guys on your
phone is convertible so heading through
Club Monaco fire just staff here same
time at the functions every time I come
here I'm always like vlogging or filming
or if you watch my Chelsea and balloon
lookbook you might recognize that most
of that was actually shot outside Club
Monaco and I was like I end up still
film at so they think I'm mad so
entirely fairly subtle but at same time
I want to show you all the lovely autumn
new things so let's go
so Chaz and I both had great success in
the clubs of Monaco although I managed
to restrain myself I only get one piece
hearing it on piece yeah quite restraint
it's a really nice new weather changes
they're all hand wash which I've got me
off a little bit on fire yeah Charlie's
getting all them as knickers in a twist
is everything tons will show me but uses
a hospital is our washing machine both
have a hand wash better you know yeah
but it's Paul remembering when we're
traveling a lot we're traveling a lot as
well like you know I dress and then we
both to point into all things I feel
like that prices a disc on a little bit
ridiculous
when and again everything in there if
your idea is swayed or Marin there a
doesn't for any videos good quality and
be excited as it is exact same price of
three times so 350 which is a lot but
the response was a lot more sleeker and
all saying China either not haven't
checked the reason probably China is for
vagina
Eliza yeah we're due next month movement
food well that's usually yeah let's see
if we sport anything on the way there
and check out my premium holes which
will have done live last week to see
what I fix up in poker
so I have a funny story about one of my
friends that recently came to shop
around Kings Road you see that guy
behind me and you probably know the ones
I mean if you've ever been shopping in
London they have one of these stores on
Kings Road and one of them I think on
South Norfolk Street they're basically
and when a guy stands outside and the
opposite of such a and if you take it
and I would see your nerd into the store
where they trying to sell you products
well we're killing it silly names so my
friend Rory that recently came over from
Hong Kong he is instantly fairly recent
experience so here is that you know what
I'm just going to put a roll with this
until they do so he went into the store
and the lady a thermal lovely hand
massage told him about the meteorites
that are in the products look how
fabulous it was it warmed up on the skin
and Rory said okay cool how much bit and
she's like no no I see you in a few
minutes and carried on giving him the
sales pitch salon experience at this
point very sinking out slightly quite no
products but I want to have like this
finally told him take a gas 988 pound
allowing you to get through the hog nice
dresses yes
rents all moist Riga 988 town lorry
obviously said no so thank you very
kindly up attempt the small versions and
we driver a login activity drops
ridiculously
this is the kind of thing you can get me
for Christmas stalling
so we've made our way down Kings Road
didn't buy anything else other than our
Club Monaco pieces but it's nice limited
window shopping and now we are having to
you to Big Easy which I have not been so
about five years for burgers cakes man
we're back home again about go to bed
now after a little bit of a drama
following our delicious meal charlie now
both in a bit of a food coma are we - a
Big Easy and we managed to leave our
Club Monaco shopping under the table so
then we got all the way home and then
went all the way back and came all the
way home again but thankfully we have
our shopping I was having a bit of a
nightmare because obviously Club Monaco
is not the cheapest of places well I'd
be upset if I left any shopping
