21 so we had a bit of a delivery this
morning
this is ginormous box has arrived
it came with its own palette which
quickly is awesome give it its blog my
state 21 houses he published in the day
after god
simple things um so yeah we had this
delivered today which is gonna be on new
television although as you can tell it's
ginormous it's meant to be 55 inch but I
don't think it's going to go in that
space there because that space it's a
lot smaller than that box
Charlie's determined to make this rug
are you like for that darling no I think
it's gone how'd you think I I think lie
it down on the ground
extra doesn't like it Lucas here its
roar Alina Hong Kong hours I guess we
did you so Rory and Nathan are here for
just tonight so we're gonna go shopping
Rory's favorite place Kings Road are
going to do some Christmas shopping Rory
squat it right now strength with me and
then we're gonna go for lunch a cafe
Monaco Charlie and Nathan are gonna join
us and then we're going to have a
festive evening it's gonna be a fun day
right darling it was very very long but
now it finally feels like Christmas now
that is cold England Rory said he hasn't
worn a jumper since this time last year
and what did you say you felt like that
I feel like a pig in a blanket
like pig in a blanket
last Christmas
oK we've just got to kingsroad
I think Morrie and I are going to divide
and conquer to start with because I'm
desperate to go into your Club Monaco
and get some winter bits and bori is
going to go to Peter Jones so I'll text
you when I'm attacked Club Monaco July
yes I'll probably be quite free from
there so let me expert okay bro race you
do
specials
and shy I keep my distance folks to
catch my
recognize me well it's been a year it
doesn't surprise
oh what a fool
but if you kissed now I know you'd fool
me again
Christmas again
one special
fringe a tight eye
hi
you and your soul eyes I got a
were someone to rely on me I guess that
was a shoulder to cry on
okay so Cory and I are in anthropology
which is looking at some home where and
I just picked up this pink Bowl and now
Rory has some very interesting facts for
us far away all right I would hello
Josie that the reason that in homework
an interior decorator is becoming very
very pink we just think it's the
opposite of blue and we look at blue
screens all day that when we come home
we now gravitate toward looking at uh
pink hues spread the offices it's so
interesting this is why I love Rory it
could be so full of fascinating facts
Rory said that his new craze obsession
is stones vibrating stones so rose
quartz is floors oh well yeah well
what's magnesium it was pyrite
all right it was for grounding and
mental healing obsidian is cooking in a
wave psychic spells and then tourmaline
or
energy so put it by your machine
ha now you know justing I'm going to
pick up some pink home where should I
get maybe a couple of plates I also pick
them up because they're very unscramble
trans people
poppy I plated yourself at Mary
let your heart be like
from now all men shovels will be
effortless
have yourself a merry little do you type
cake
now all my travels whooping miles away
here we are as in olden days happy
golden days of yore faithful Friends who
are dear to us gather near to us once
more through the years we all will be
together if the fates allow hang a
shining star upon the highest
yeah back home again now I can't
remember when I last spoke to the camera
but I think it was when we were in
anthropology so since then Rory and I
continued shopping for a little bit
Nathan joined us for lunch we went to
Selfridges on the roof again which was
so nice their cheese fondue is probably
my favorite naughty treat that was
really lovely and I also picked up some
Christmas presents for Charlie the ones
that didn't arrive yesterday I'm not
going to hold out waiting for them so I
went and bought the same thing in
Selfridges and when the online order
comes I'll just return it because don't
need two sets of everything I've just
come home to see that the new TV is on
the dining room table apparently it's
too big for the hole so Charlie has
taken away the old one uninstalled it
and tried to put the new one in and it's
too big so silly Charlie for not
measuring I knew as soon as I saw that
box it was going to be far too big so
I'm going to crack on with a little bit
of wrapping and then Vicky's coming a
bit later for a festive evening so
Charlie's back home and we're just
having a play around with our new TV
although sadly we're having to leave it
underneath the place where it's meant to
be because as I said earlier it's too
big because somebody didn't measure it
but I do - it is very cool in that you
can change the color behind it so look
how the water is flowing red changer
which and it can change with the mood of
the film you're watching look this I
mean a cool light has probably made a
deep-water to my finger thank you I look
at blue light cubes your way Rory's not
a fan of the light and apparently
because if you watched my autumn home
updates video you might remember we got
philips hue light bulbs apparently we
can coordinate it with those as well
so I have a very color-coordinated
lounge good morning so sorry I didn't
finish vlogging properly yesterday but I
thought I would finish today's
yesterday's vlog off properly this
morning excuse my parents I have just
got back from the gym so I thought I
would quickly show you what I bought on
Kings Road yesterday because you guys
saw me shopping that I didn't show you
what I picked up so I'm going to do that
now before I switch off and start
vlogging today's vlogmas would you think
sausage hmm why do you think so
the first shop that I went into was Club
Monaco and they had an amazing sale on
so I picked up a few nice bits and bobs
first of which was this beautiful
headband and this one I think was down
to 30 pounds yep 65 down to 33 which I
thought was really lovely this would be
so nice if and when I go skiing and but
also on those slightly colder morning's
just to keep my ears warm and keep my
head a little bit warmer that was the
first thing and then this one was
actually full price but I've been
looking for a wintery skirt for quite
some time and to be honest when I tried
it on the fitting rooms on vlog it
didn't look anything special but in real
life it did look rather lovely so I got
this one it's got a beautiful frill
detail on the hem so beautiful kind of
Tweedy material looks really lovely when
on and then finally this lovely pink
scarf to be honest I just fell in love
with the color of this one I've been
looking out for a big thick scarf I can
really bundle myself up in and this one
was still expensive it was down from one
one five to 81 but I think when you
invest in pieces like this they will
last a really long time so I thought I'd
treat myself to those few pieces then I
went to sweaty Betty because I noticed
they had their sale on and I picked up a
few bits in the sale I got a few pairs
of trainer liner socks these actually
weren't on the sale but I just needed
some new ones I think about six pound a
pair yeah and I really like they have
this bit it just stops your feet from
getting blisters or anything like that
in fact I'm wearing some today oh no
these are still sweaty Betty socks where
they don't have that plump bit at the
end and wearing my sweaty Betty leggings
and also this white top I think the last
time I've logged in my gym gear I was
wearing this exact gym outfit so yeah I
picked up three pairs of trainer liners
and then this neon pink item I think
isn't sale no full price not doing very
well with my sale haul am i but I just
really love the color of this it's a
sports bra and it's got the really
lovely strap detail so I really like
sweaty Betty straps on their work out
top so if I do get absolutely roasting
and I want to take my top off this is
still
a really attractive design that I don't
feel too silly just wearing this on its
own in the gym then I got a workout top
I have got so many workout tops but a
lot of them are neon and at the moment
I'm quite liking slightly more muted
tops I mean going a little bit more
neutral in the gym recently this one is
that workout fabrics it's really
lightweight but also breathable has a
matte finish and I thought that this
pattern can you see it yeah
would go really well with my leggings in
fact it probably is the matching design
so that'll look really nice and then I
got one more just a plain white top this
was in the sale from 50 down to 25 and
this one was 55 down to 28 so really
good discounts I definitely recommend
checking out sweaty Betty during their
sale time so this one is a little bit
kind of like a wife beater style I'm not
doing very well at showing it on my
really low arm holes but it's a plain
white male material so maybe more
springtime with something like this
underneath that'll look really lovely
finally I went to Zara I wasn't really
planning on picking anything up but then
I saw this which not doing very well
it's showing you but it is a dress in
this beautiful pink satin material I
thought the color was absolutely
gorgeous and I thought for New Year or
Christmas would be a really lovely one
to wear it's got a perfect length sleeve
three-quarter sleeves fairly low cut so
I'm hoping it's not going to be too
revealing and then you've got this knot
detail in the middle I just thought the
material was so beautiful even with
black tights and black heels this could
look really stunning and then I picked
up a jumper because just really liked it
quite casual style big white chunky knit
and then it's got these ties on the
sleeves so I can do a little bow just to
make it a little bit more on trend and
then you've got a slightly um what do
you call this like a dip pan split hem I
don't know multi-leveled hem on the
bottom sunlight end up wearing yesterday
looks so lovely and cozy so they're the
bits that I picked up in yesterday's
shopping haul I hope you guys enjoyed
coming shopping with me as I'm going to
end this vlog here and start tomorrow's
vlog well today for me
um and so see you tomorrow thanks so
much for watching bye
good morning and welcome to vlogmas day
23 so it's the eve of Christmas Eve
today which means when you guys watching
it it's going to be Christmas Eve so
Charlie and extra night are about to go
for a walk Dexter and I are wearing our
matching jackets not sure if you can see
but Dexter's I think Texas is from next
it swags and whiskers which is next and
doggie range but it's really cute
because we're all matching don't know if
Charles going to wear his one as well so
the three of us are all wearing matching
outfits
um so yeah this morning Rory and Nathan
left quite early they are heading back
to their homes for Christmas and then
Charlie and I went to the gym we did a
good session actually we did ABS then I
did some cross-training and then I did
some squats and then we did some arms so
pretty much full body exercise and then
we had a breakfast at Gail's I was
really naughty and I got French brioche
toast and bacon so I have topped up on
my calories those I burnt away in the
gym and now it's going to take Dexter
for a little walk to stretch his legs
and tie him out so that hopefully he'll
leave us in peace
to get everything ready to leave for mom
tomorrow for Christmas Eve I look really
handsome he's not happy bubby oh you're
the most handsome boy in the world feel
like it looks a bit like a dress one
more time yes I am I'm so smart I've got
a smart bottom back from the walk and I
took seven windswept oh my gosh bad hair
day
wow so bright gosh I literally look like
I'm in drag through a hedge backwards um
so it's gonna put the kettle on make
myself a cup of tea and then I'm gonna
edit a video which I'm going to publish
live on Boxing Day so I'm going to get
that done charlie is in the hairdresser
so any last-minute rapping I'm gonna do
that as well and I just got a delivery
from Olympus I can get some straps ly
ordered ages ago so that we could open
that together
gosh that was hard to open okay
so beautiful pink wrapping Merry
Christmas and Happy New Year dear Josie
remember that wonderful sunshine in
Greece that suddenly put a smile on our
faces we all love Christmas it's
wonderful time of year thank you bring
with us throughout our exciting pen
journey so here are our beautiful pen
fashion accessories and a special
Christmas gift so let's see what we've
got
I'm done I love all this new Olympus
packaging very fashion bloggers ask so
this is one that I chose when we were
out in Greece and then a shoulder strap
I think that's another one that I chose
here's one more thing
Oh nope maybe not just these two okay so
this one it should be a blush leather
shoulder strap this one here and this
will be really good for just carrying it
when I'm out and about particularly when
I'm traveling as we come in coming in
really handy and then this pouch is
particularly good if like me always
carry around loads different lenses
there we go so this is my new pouch and
it's quite well padded so this would be
really good for protecting not only my
camera but also my 75 mil lens and 45
millon lens so that I don't have to
carry a big camera around with me also
this really lovely blue spotty paint
print which I really like so - very
handy accessories so thank you very much
Olympus just in time for Christmas
so just spent the past three hours
editing the video that's going to be
going live on Boxing Day and it's now
603 and we're going out for dinner at
7:00 so haven't had time to put a
vlogmas up today um you guys already
guessed it by now but today's vlog has
suddenly become a 2-day vlog because
thought I'd do a little mashup don't
want to miss out on a blog on Christmas
Eve so yeah I hope you don't mind the
fact that the flock must schedule went
up in the air a little bit today so
thought in this hour that I've got now
before we go out I'm just going to show
you my quick pamper routine so this is
kind of thing that will give long
lasting results so I'm going to use
proper fake tan see my nails hope you've
got time with a gel nail varnish and you
just have a little bit of a pamper but
I'm not going to wash my hair because
don't have time and I'm going to go to
Jim's bar so at which point so I'm going
to start off by using the Vita Liberata
Express tan that I got in my blogger Mel
in the vlog that you guys watched
yesterday and it's meant to start
working in 10 minutes so let's give it a
go what do you reckon to that idea my
small and hairy friend he says I like
that idea mommy yay you're so perfect
Roni all the girl dogs fancy you okay so
this is the tan I'm going to try
apparently you put it on you wait ten
minutes and then you rinse it off in the
shower and then it continues to develop
for the next four to six hours so let's
give it a go
and try not least
so it's got a little bit of a guide
color not quite as much and say as their
other fake turns out the shower now it's
nice and not to smell or fake tan and
know that it's actually working its way
on me I find it so hard to believe that
something that was on my body for 10
minutes and now is not on my body it's
going to continue telling me I just
can't work out science and that but I
trust me to errata I love everything
else I've tried from them so fingers
crossed I will be a bronze goddess and I
wake up in the morning I'll keep you
guys updated and maybe like one tenth
more dark now from the guide color
perhaps but really nothing noticeable so
hopefully over the next few hours will
continue to develop I guess I'll show
you guys in tomorrow's vlogmas which is
gonna be the last dogmas of 2016 so yeah
I'll keep you updated now I'm going to
slather on some body lotion and sort of
my face out because I'm actually leaving
to meet our friends in 25 minute okay
it's 15 minutes later and I'm looking
hopefully a whole lot more glamorous
than the last time you saw me don't know
what going to do with my hair and it's
been in French plants for the past like
24 hours and I quite like it messy don't
know if I look like a crazy cat lady
though don't know might just leave it
down and go with the flow
Charlie's still wearing presents
downstairs which means we're not leaving
at 7 o'clock but we're going to have to
leave very soon but what I'm going to do
is get completely ready so shoes on
boots on wait does the same thing shoes
on G lay on humbug on pack my handbag
and then I'm going to paint my nails I
always paint my nails out so you last
and even get my oyster card out so they
can be drying on the bus that's my top
tip for if you're getting ready in a
huge rush like I am today makeup wise I
used a lot of things from the beauty pie
box which I spoke about in a recent blog
a melon boxing all the products have
been trying so far really impressed with
this one is the great skin foundation
and shade is light 400 buff apparently I
put that in with my Beauty Blender
sponge and then on my lips I've got the
lipstick that came with the Beauty pie
box and that's cowboy nude I really like
this color it's a matte brownie pink but
yeah seems to go with a lot of things
in fact I'm gonna put this in my handbag
okay I'm going to get ready get dressed
and boots on she lay on and then it's
now time I'm going to use nail berry
dial M for maroon and then I'm going to
use my every year I use this my
Christmas nail varnish is the Essie nail
lacquer don't know what the shade is oh
here we go
summit of style maybe I'll do like I
don't know an accent nail or or figure
something out
okay haven't quite had time to finish my
nails I didn't get to the glitter part
yet but they're still looking better
than they were because we're gonna head
out now so we're going to I think we're
going to dip and flip which is a burger
