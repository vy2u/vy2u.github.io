an empty ginormous room look out big
places so it in the stable block because
they don't allow dogs in the main house
so because we've got Dexter we have been
able to stay in their stable block which
is just across the across the driveway
so this is the room as you can see
behind me turn off tea and coffee making
facilities and a big garden as well and
a hot thought we didn't bring it any of
our swimming stuff just I didn't maybe
Charlie can go in yes a big garden hot
tub and I'm nice and through here a nice
bathroom we've also got cupcakes I'm
definitely gonna take the larger of the
two yeah phones ringing what does they
want what do you think about that Dexter
so after eating those cupcakes which I'm
now presuming were beetroot my mouth
well I kind of look like a flesh-eating
zombie look at my teeth oh yeah I'll put
on some lip sticks I don't look too
terrifying but Charlie night
yeah and my tongue is progress so
Charlie and I are now going to play a
game of croquet and but because I didn't
pack very well at all even though I knew
it's gonna be 28 degrees I'm having to
wear because I meant one of I'm having
to wear my pajama shorts out to play
croquet but luckily they're just plain
white shorts so hopefully doesn't look
too bad is it just me it's anyone I want
to do this just epic fail when it comes
to packing no shorts no summer dresses
just jeans so I'm gonna wear my little
white pajama shorts with this top this
is literally the most summery outfit I
can come up with today fashion failure
aside let's go play croquet so here is
our croquet pitch we're gonna play lower
Rylands rules which is useful if I don't
know if he's the proper host the
reigning champion well two wins and
you've never beaten me I also won twice
in our island and twice consecutively
back-to-back in Qatar Qatar
so we're gonna play lower Islands rules
which is basically once the right
direction through the loops if you get
it through the loop then you get another
go if your ball hits someone else's ball
then you get to like a boot them out the
way and first to make it round all the
loops and to tap that middle post is the
croquet champion okay pushes on josephus
way how you feelin chase and go through
no I went to the side that was terrible
so this is great to me actually yours is
worse than mine no mean well if you hit
my ball then I get to hit yours all the
way haha
can't hit mine but I get it free darling
otherwise you're losing yes not so good
it's getting very tense huh I'm one hoop
away from the middle as a child but his
ball is an option as good a position of
mine
haha
Oh Charlies back in the game because I
missed the ball but I've got one more
opportunity to get it this could be your
chart if you missed this event
absolutely it's getting tense it's an
equal playing field Charlie could smash
it right now you're kidding me
me you've got one more shot you're gonna
win well weld under eyeballs it over the
last minute how do you feel quickly
champion it's a hard job you know but
I'd like to thank my sponsors family
most importantly myself
your nipples are really prominent in
that top right
as you can imagine our hot obsession was
not that peaceful because a certain
sausage dog shaped animal around the
thought that he wanted to join it so
while China relaxing Dexter was barking
the whole times whom you've seen the
hotter for about 15 minutes if that and
we come inside I'm gonna have a bit of a
panel session now it's still really nice
outside but I wanted to try this mask
which is the fresh from a brand play
purifying the mask I actually got one of
these for Charlie from Sephora a little
while ago but we're on to our tub number
two now and although I haven't tried it
before I think Charles's probably
finished the first one have you dying
he's not listening um so yeah this has
only got to be left on for three minutes
and then I'm gonna hop in the shower do
my hair and hopefully it'll still be
nice and light to take some photos in
the grounds of the hotel before dinner
and we've got is in 8 calls to taste a
mini tonight yeah yeah so it's gonna be
a really snazzy dinner which I'm already
starting to get hungry
good morning I didn't really finish off
the vlog last night because chai and I
were in a little bit of a food coma we
had an incredible eight course taste
menu mmm eight cores tasting menu at the
sorters manor house last night in their
restaurant which was fantastic good
thing about tasting menus is that
everything's quite small so you don't
get to stuffed but the courses were
amazing and they had like mustard savory
macaroons with almost like bubbles in
like you get in bubble tea which was
just incredible we have beef duck
everything yeah
pigeon charlie had lobster I don't like
fish that I swapped in a couple of the
courses and we also had a bottle of wine
from the della Graff estate which is
where we went in South Africa so that's
really nice
although they did try to give us did you
figure out how much that wine was they
tried to give us a different wine with
the same name but not from the Telegraph
and we have a feeling it was a really
really expensive one because they had to
come and get it from the seller but
luckily charlie spotted otherwise we
could have had a very hefty bill on our
hands and then we went to sleep we have
the world's biggest that this bed is
just about twice the size of our bed at
home it's up to you ginormous although
Dexter kept hearing things in the night
and was barking like a mad dog so he's
currently passed out because he's so
tired beautiful morning and we're gonna
go for a walk shortly we're just gonna
go and grab some breakfast in the same
restaurant as where we had dinner last
night and then another lovely day in the
Cotswolds I think that was a Shetland
pony heaven Yeah right either
so I've had breakfast we checked out the
hotel and we are now enjoying the
beautiful countryside coming for a walk
beautiful warm sun is shining and
Dexter's has met his first Ponies behind
me I think I shot them ponies or one of
them at least is but beautiful way to
spend the morning makes me really miss
living in the countryside peace today
will spread this all the time back in
glass turning which has a doctor yeah
lovely to be back is facing the city
even if just for a couple of days
so I attempt to get supported on water
as an epic fail we took a wrong turn and
we ended up in a house because lead
instead and we've got to get to del CID
for half 12 so we're on our way back now
nearly at the car I'm gonna have my
third outfit change of the day come on
Selena decide what to wear it's
snowboarding today and and then we're
gonna head to dance but rude I'm so
tired I don't want to walk anymore I
don't have any energy walking what we do
here just go back back back back
we
do sections do you know that's probably
mine the Greek
mr. bill
so we're now leaving and the delaford it
was a really lovely way to spend our
final opening the Cotswolds I'm just set
off sat-nav factory to London sadly back
to the smoke but as you saw a really
kindly showed shown around the farm by
Matthew who's the marketing manager here
showed us around the farm it's all of
course a hundred percent organic and
yeah it's really lovely to see all
around the farm some beautiful very ugly
looking Tomatoes which were delicious
when I darling no but they like it's
good that there any pesticides or
anything yeah yeah that's how they meant
to be and saw the cows and the ghosts of
old spot pigs we saw where the are
the strawberries of farms really lovely
to having a ground and then we saw the
Bamford
hay barn the shop just generally the
most beautiful photogenic place I think
I've been in quite a long time it was
really nice way to spend the afternoon
and now sadly we are heading and back to
London it's been a really perfect couple
of days it's a nice having Dexter along
as well he's had a wonderful time
yeah so seeing as we're heading back to
London now and all we're going to be
doing is driving I think I will end the
vlog here so thank you so much for
watching I'm going to be doing a couple
of blog posts on our trip here as well I
could go into the Cotswolds so if that's
life I've got time and on Charlie's blog
