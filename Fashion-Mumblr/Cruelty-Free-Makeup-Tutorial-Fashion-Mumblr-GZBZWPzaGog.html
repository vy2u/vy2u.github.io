you for joining me for today's video
which is going to be a cruelty-free
makeup tutorial so this here is the
finished look and the products that I
used are all against animal testing and
cruelty free so it's something that I've
been as I said when I talk about some
time I am a huge animal lover and I have
been a lot more conscious recently as to
whether the brands that I'm using are
against animal testing I love animals of
all kinds and the thought of animal
testing makes me really freakin angry
sadly I cannot cut all brands that do
tests on animals out of my routine
because I do feel like it'd be a bit
hypocritical I do eat meat I do wear
leather that those are lifestyle choices
I've made so I do feel like it would be
hypocritical of me to say I'm not going
to use makeup or skincare that tests on
animals I have found myself recently
being a lot more conscious making
purchase decisions on brands that I'm
more familiar that do not do animal
testing and and I have been very very
pleasantly surprised to see that a lot
of my favourite brands and products I
use on a daily basis are against animal
testing so the purpose of this video is
to share with you a few of my favourite
brands and products that are cruelty
free
and show you how you can create a
beautiful makeup look without using
products that have been tested on
animals before I get started just a few
notes on things that I have really
discovered while researching
cruelty-free brands firstly there is a
little bit of kind of blurred lines when
it comes to companies and their parent
companies so a lot of brands such as
Urban Decay even like bare minerals they
are as a brand they are completely
against animal cruelty they do not allow
any of their suppliers to test on
animals they do not test on animals
themselves but potentially the company
that owns them so whether it's L'Oreal
or should say dope they do work the
brands that do tests on animals so
there's a little bit of as I said red
lines when it comes to those brands but
in this video I have included those
brands because the brands themselves do
not test on animals in a lot of cases
like for example Urban Decay when they
sold to L'Oreal they said we will not
allow our products we test on animals
and they stuck to their guns so well
done over the k-band minerals for
sticking to your guns
then of course sorry about the lighting
right away he's a natural axe day then
of course there are products that are
sold in China if a product is sold in
China to the best of my knowledge I
think that they have to test on animals
it's Chinese law that if the product
that is used on your face for your
skincare or makeup is sold in China it
has to be tested on animals first I
really don't like that law at all I
think the Chinese government to be
completely honest I think it's a
horrible government I just don't like
what goes up in that country and that's
not me being racist I just a lot of what
happens in China it makes me feel very
sick I'm not going to go into that and
please don't write that kind of stuff in
the comments because it really upsets me
but yeah any of these friends are sold
in China those products have been tested
on animals but here in Europe and I'm
showing the u.s. to the products have
not been tested on animals it's just the
batch that are sold in China but yeah so
today's video is me using a few of my
favorite brands which are all cruelty
free to create this makeup look so I
really hope you like this look and if
you'd like to see how I created it then
carry on of watching first of all I'm
going to start off with my skincare and
I'm using three products all of which
are cruelty free
which is the yes - coconut wipes I
absolutely love these because firstly
they're cruelty free and secondly they
smell amazing I love this tiny packet
it's great for traveling they keep
really fresh because this fancy little
opening section so I started by
cleansing my face with face wipes I have
as you know if you watched yesterday's
video I recently had my eyes tattooed
just a couple of days ago so I have to
use face wipes or my seal of water on a
cotton pad at the moment because I can't
get any water out or make up near my
eyebrows so these are really good at the
moment for me just to be very precise
with where I cleanse and I'm using the
bare minerals smart combination
smoothing at lightweight emulsion and I
find that this gives me a really good
skin day I love bare nails as a brand
everything this sunport I just
absolutely adore and this is a fantastic
product so this is what I applied just
patted it all over my face next and
finally because my skin is fairly
dehydrated at the moment I went in with
the Charlotte Tilbury
magic cream and this is a product that
I've known about and loved for such a
long time I'm pretty fighting through it
I've nearly finished it sadly but it's
great for dry skin it's really luxurious
and moisturizing products and great to
face for makeup so those are three skin
care products that I used now prepare
yourself for my makeup free face and
just wanting you my eyebrows are fairly
bold when I don't have any makeup on so
you've been warned and I hope you enjoy
the makeup tutorial the first thing I'm
going to use on my face is the by terry
cellular rose moisturizing CC cream and
according to my internet research by
terry do not test on animals and none of
their suppliers test on animals on their
behalf and by terry cell in Hong Kong
but they do not sell in mainland China
so all signs are pointing in the right
direction for animal testing but of
course if you do know anything different
the websites I looked at the last time
they've been updated was in 2014 so let
me know if you do know anything at
different I'm going to blend that in
using my Beauty Blender and I'm going to
spread
this with my vitamin e face mist from
the body shop and body shop itself is
against animal testing however its
parent company is not so guess it
depends how you look at it but I'm gonna
I'm gonna cool a body shop a
cruelty-free brand because they
themselves do not condone it testing on
animals
so my skin is fairly bad today and I've
got quite a few spots my eyes are really
red I don't know why I think maybe I'm
getting a little bit hay fever so I'm
having to use quite a bit of the CC
cream which in itself is quite like some
sort of glenn liston and then i'm
probably gonna put in another layer of
coverage so having applied the by terry
cellular rose all over my face it's
given a really lovely light coverage but
i do still have some areas of redness
and I'm a little bit shiny so I'm going
to go in with a concealer for those
little dervish marks I'm going to use
the origins plant scription concealer
which is an absolute favorite of mine so
obviously I'm really pleased that this
is against animal cruelty so I'm just
tapping that onto my skin and using my
finger to blend that one in I'm also
gonna bring this over my eyelids because
I really like the consistency of the
plants scription concealer as a base to
my eyeshadow so I could use an eyeshadow
primer but I find that a concealer works
just as well and it gives a really nice
color just a really flat color to start
building eye makeup on and then because
I do want to create a little bit more of
a mattified look a little bit higher
coverage because my skin isn't its best
at the moment I'm going to use a new
launch from bare minerals and this is
their bare Pro powder foundations this
is brand new and the aim is to build
coverage without looking cakey that so
that whole idea behind this one is and
they have bought out their own brush for
this bareMinerals as a whole they do not
test on animals so this is synthetic
brush fiber so I'm going to apply the
brush straight onto the powder it does
have a compact sponge underneath but I'm
going to use the brush it's gonna brush
that on there and then apply directly to
my skin so this should add more coverage
as you can see it is creating actually
it's a little bit too light for me Singh
we have to go in with some bronzer and
but yeah this is adding coverage and
mattifying
without taking up my base which is what
we want I do like my skin to look like
skin after all so this is given a really
lovely just a mattified effect of the
whole of my face I'm no longer super
shiny but I do have a lovely natural
glow so that's a really nice finish
first impressions of that are really
good this is actually the first time
I've tried it I don't know what is wrong
with my under-eye bags today it just
seemed to be very there today I'm going
to use the it cosmetics bye bye
under-eye because this is a really good
under-eye concealer a really strong
concealer for the under-eye but again
against animal testing so I'll just put
a teeny amount on my finger literally
about a third of the size of a grain of
rice and I'm gonna blend that and then
top that under the eye I'm just going to
use my finger to blend that in remember
how it doesn't really cure the puffiness
it does get rid of the shadows and
here's a nice strong can see level with
a really good consistency so it blends
into the skin really very well I do want
to set my under eye concealer in place
so I'm going to use the bare minerals I
always forget the name of this one
translucent powder duo and this is a
favorite of mine at the moment it's got
a natural and then a glowing powder in
there both of which I love I'm going to
use my zoeva fan brush zoeva is against
animal testing but their products aren't
completely vegan because obviously
they've got some natural hair and some
of their brushes I'm just swiping this
brush across the mat twine from the bare
minerals palette and popping that on the
areas where my makeup does tend to
disappear as the day goes on so just
really setting that in place and fine
you for the base I'm going to bring some
color back into my face with bronzer and
I'm going to use the hourglass ambient
lighting bronzer in luminous bronze
light I'm so pleased that hourglass is
cruelty free so yeah this is one of my
favorite bronzer so really black this
cruelty free again I'm using a zoeva
brush as my so leave a powder brush and
as usual starting on the cheekbone
bringing the color I hope the rest of my
face so I always apply bronzer in the
areas that the Sun would naturally touch
my face I'm young we start with under
the cheekbones and then on my hairline
my nose or my chin just as I said where
the Sun would catch it so once I've done
my bronzer I feel a lot more human and
just to make myself a little bit more
comfortable and to prepare for lipstick
later on I'm going to apply a lip balm
and this one is the pixie shear butter
lip balm and it does ever so slightly
tint the lips but also it's just a
really comfortable lip balm so I've just
applied a little bit of that and and
I'll mean the my lips are nice and
hydrated ready for applying lipstick
later what I would normally do next is
my eyebrows but as you guys know I had
them tattooed a couple of days ago so I
don't need to do anything for my brows
however if I did want to add anything to
them I could use my Anastasia brow Wiz
Anastasia Beverly Hills do not test on
animals and their brows is a favorite
product of mine so before I had my brows
done I did used to be a huge huge fan of
this so if you're doing a brows highly
recommend the brow Wiz so the next thing
I'm going to do is my eye shadow I
already have the origins pan scripture
and concealer on there as a base so the
next thing I'm going to go in with is
the body shop down-to-earth I palette
and I actually think that this palette
is a really good tube color wise for a
lot of tomforde palettes so all over
these shades are very similar to Tom
Ford colors and I really really like it
and I think it's really good to you of
course
body shop against animal testing and I'm
going to start off with I think this top
right hand color it's quite a nudie
color going to wash that all over my
eyelid using a zoeva brush so I've swept
this color all over my actual eyelids
and I've blended it up towards the brow
bone just to give a really lovely
neutral base color next I'm going to go
into something a little bit shimmery and
for this I'm actually taking a shade
from my pure minerals bronzer and yeah I
know it's a little bit strange to use a
bronzer for your eyeshadow but this one
I really love how it's got all these
different lines and I've been using
these two shades
as a gold and a bronze color and I just
find that by picking out these colors
they make for really beautiful
eyeshadows and pure minerals is a really
good brand for being against animal
testing so I've taken that same brush
and then just swiping it across this
middle one and again I'm just gonna pop
that on the actual lid taking it right
into the corners to give my eyes a bit
of a pop I just find this is such a
flattering color very summery but also
will go down where you will import them
as well so it's quite a warm shade and
then I like to take a slimmer brush this
one is the zoeva luxe precise shader I'm
taking the same color and just bringing
it underneath my lower lash line as well
and then taking the shade below this is
a slightly more bronze color a little
bit less on my brush and I'm going to
put this in the crease next to add even
more depth to my eyes I'm going to use a
shade from these Weaver stories so it's
disgustingly dirty from these Oliva nude
spectrum eyeshadow palette I think I'm
going to go for a slightly warmer one so
this one here is n D 120
I know it's n d0 19th members are above
it not below it so just using the same
brush again I don't need to worry about
using a clean brush every time just a
tiny little bit on there and I'm going
to apply this into the corners this just
adds another shade and really helps to
build up a very natural smoky eye really
blendable as well only need is some more
bit on your brush that will do two eyes
and finally I'm going to blend with my
zoeva luxe soft crease brush just to
blend all the colors into one ever since
I tried this product I have been
absolutely obsessed with it and
thankfully Illamasqua also do not test
tests against animals I'm afraid I do
not know the exact name of this product
it doesn't have any writing on it but it
is a pink sparkly eyeshadow from
Illamasqua you hardly need anything from
Nessa to create a really beautiful
shimmer on your eye
so using that same brush just rolling it
on to the product pick up a little bit
of the shimmer and I'm going to apply
this director to the eyelets I just
think this is absolutely gorgeous just a
tiniest amount really adds so much
shimmer to the eye i hope the camera is
picking this up but it's just really
added a beautiful quite I mean it is
subtle you could definitely build this
up to make it really sparkly but I'm not
about big sparkly eyes so the amount of
shimmer that this gives is just
absolutely perfect think it's such a
beautiful way of adding a bit of shimmer
into everyday look so I'm really happy
with how the eyes look now hope you have
uxq some close-ups at the ends I feel
like you can't really see from this far
away next I'm going to apply it mascara
and my cruelty free mascara whereas it
is from benefit benefit up against
animal testing Jara and I'm going to use
their roller lash mascara I do however
believe that benefit is sold in China
and as I was saying earlier any products
that are sold in China do you have to
have been tested on animals by law so
that means that they're not completely
against animal testing if they were they
wouldn't sell in China and but the
products that we buy here in the UK in
America they are most definitely free
from animal cruelty
so roller lash is one of my all-time
favorite mascaras I find that I don't
need lash curlers when I use it I can
just apply it straight onto my lashes um
but also of course to face is against
animal testing as well and they're
better than sex it's also a really good
mascara if you're looking for a great
cruelty free mascara so there we go just
a couple of layers of the roller lash
mascara and my lashes are looking rather
amazing if I do say so myself every time
I use this I'm just blown away with how
great it is so that's mascara done next
I'm going to move to the lips I couldn't
decide between these two products for my
lips so I'm gonna try using both of them
first one is my bite Beauty amaretto
matte creme lip cream it's the world's
longest name by beauty is a brand which
I always pick up when I go to America
and this is my favorite product probably
my top lip product of all time so I'm
really pleased that it is
against animal testing it's just the
easiest thing in the world to apply
could play over lip on you can play on
its own then lip balm over the top if
you've got dry lips or just on its own
and it's such a beautiful color easy to
apply its roll up so it's never needs
sharpening or anything beautiful color
that just lasts so long some a really
really big fan of this this is pretty
much my essential lip color so this is
how my lips look just with the bite
Beauty on them it is fairly natural you
could build this up a little bit more
for a bit more color but this as you
guys know it's just such a staple lip
color for me I wear this 99% of the time
but to shake things up a little bit I'm
also going to apply a layer of Charlotte
Tilbury Hepburn honey such a fan of
charlotte tilbury lipsticks and the
brand as a whole that makeup artist can
do no wrong in my eyes so I'm going to
make this look a little bit more nude
with the Hepburn honey shade color wise
it's not all that different to just
wearing the mattes and the biomat creme
lip crayon but I do slightly prefer the
consistency of the Charlotte jewelry so
it's really lovely to blend the two now
I could stop here but I'm going to apply
a little bit of blush and highlight just
because my eyes are very neutral colors
my lips are quite neutral so I'm going
to add that pop of color to my cheeks
for blush I'm going to start with a new
product from Pixie pixi by petra and
this is their multi balm I've got the
shape baby petal which is a really
beautiful very wearable pink shade it's
not too girly girly like it's not too
peachy pink it's quite a neutral pink
and I'm going to take one of my Sunita
brushes just lightly swipe over that
I've not used this before on my cheek so
I'm not sure how I mean how it's going
to come out so I'm just going quite
carefully here what I love about this
kind of consistency is that it really
does look natural on the cheeks so let's
just apply that to the uppers in my
cheeks
that is such a lovely natural color
hopefully the camera is picking it up
but just a really beautiful natural
flush just gonna blend that in all the
way up to my ear oh how do you have this
shades so much I think this is the
favorite blush that I've tried in such a
long time and because it's cream at
blends just so easily as well
these multi farms you can use on your
lips too but I think that this cheek
color is just absolutely stunning really
really happy with how that looks I do I
don't know if this is like a normal
thing to do but I do always like to
apply a little bit of powder blush after
cream blush because in my mind it sets
it and it just adds a little bit more
intensity to the color so I'm going to
use another brush from zoeva and this is
from the Rose golden blush set so you've
got contour highlights and blush and I
just love the blush shade I do the use
where is it
my zoeva family brush I use so much just
come swipe that over there this does act
as highlighters works it does have that
shimmer in it and I'm gonna use a
separate highlighter afterwards as well
so this I feel just kind of sets in that
cream blush I've just added the tiniest
amount of that and then to finish where
is my mary-lou manizer I'm going to use
this one the ultimate blogger favorite
highlighter from at the barn which is
again cruelty free brush wise you
guessed it going to use my fan brush
again I don't really find that because I
don't use that much product on it I'm
always very light handed with it it
doesn't really transfer from one to the
next I'm not gonna be getting blusher in
my highlight area but just lightly
swiping that over and then patting that
onto my upper cheekbone to add that very
natural shimmer also Evers left on the
brush just under the eyebrows and there
we go we are done it's her honestly I
think this is probably one of the
favorite makeup looks I've created in a
long time and I'm so pleased at all of
these brands are cruelty free as a
makeup look I just absolutely love it it
makes you realize that you really can
create the look that you want without
using any brands that do do animal
testing as having
it does still happen but we can get the
liquor we want without using those
brands so really hope you guys enjoyed
this video

in August 2012 so if you're watching
this in a year or two years time then
some things might have changed more
