day I chose a very easy to take on and
off outfit of shopping so I've just got
my little beach style dress on my Prada
bag this jacket is getting a lot of
compliments a Texan to love the tassels
and then I've put on some flat shoes so
very easy to navigate them all tactical
out patrols

always say it explained and I wanna
build my power
and now only
so much better and there will be no
anomaly night's baby ever let me try

like this tie waist detail and then the
shorts have got the beautiful scalloped
bottom and definitely gonna get a shorts

they come up hip level which I'm just
not used to might try the next size up

Charlie's done it every day we've been
here in Dallas not gonna lie I've heard
that berries is very scary I'm a bit
nervous but I've got my lovely sweaty
flirty outfit on so at least I'll look
good even if I fall off the track and
also survived Barry's boot camp it was
pretty tough not gonna lies they did
like it was what was it 12 minutes
treadmill star yeah and then 12 minutes
12 minutes on the treadmill event
ominous arms but is much better than I
thought it was going to be actually live
one and I'm like yeah very similar yeah
it was intense but I survived and I have
an amazing smoothie this is probably the
I mean they've ever tasted its acai
berry like bee pollen and everything
else in there I can't be helped no it
can't taste too good but we are now on a
mission to find some brunch so hopefully
we'll find some I knife and then maybe

minute I'm high on slow dancing with you

all blacked out
I care that my lungs

it's a little bit later on now hope you
can hear me over the wind if Charlie and
I have come to the Highland Park village
which was our favorite shopping place
last time
it's got slightly more high-end we
started off by popping into bird bakery
it's a very photogenic little cafe got
to myself an almond milk latte and now
we are going to explore some other shops
there's another Tory Burch here and then
there's lots of designer stores like
Celine Balenciaga and Louie Vuitton not
that I'm planning on buying anything too
expensive but it's always nice to browse
but going faster getting Wilder don't
care if I get out like you feel that be
getting
we're rebels at least for tonight
the heart
paint just all
we
even trying anything Ellen's in the
store because it's quite expensive but
this fitting room is my speech for
picking room I've ever seen
Charley's representing on a much bigger
price scale like born in love with a
g-wagen too big look how big it is from
her feet and now they're gonna be
looking out the window
yeah I'd seem think you would love them
could I have hell
time for lunch
Charlie's got a buttermilk chicken
sandwich is it good really good chips of
course and I for once I've gone for the
healthy option after three days of
eating absolute crap and it's a kale and
chicken salad Charlie's just bumped into
a couple of visit Instagram friends that
live in Chicago and LA it is the
smallest world ever Instagram drawing
everybody together on a petit so we are
back at our apartment again after a
lovely shopping trip and a really really
nice lunch as well and sadly it is time
to leave Dallas but before I switch off
the vlog I'm going to quickly tell you a
little bit about the light to know it
app because we've heard so much about it
during our time here at the conference
and I don't know if you guys are
probably 100% sure what it does
basically it is the way to shop your
favorite bloggers Instagram and not just
mine but every vlogger that you follow
pretty much will be on the app because
it automatically puts the photos that we
post on Instagram onto that app as well
as loads of additional photos like
close-ups and flat layers and things
that we may not put on our own
instagrams and it's all shopper but it's
got really easy to shop links down below
I'll put a little overlay on the screen
here so you can see my profile and a
couple of my most recent images and how
you can see the products underneath and
as well as just seeing the products
always he can click through to buy them
I'll always try and put UK and US links
as well so no matter where you guys are
you can hopefully shop the pictures and
they've also just released this is not
sponsored by the way they've also just
released a wishlist functions you can
just add all the items that you really
like and maybe you want to save until
payday you can just click the little
heart on them and then they will be
saved to your wishlist page which you
can see on the screen now this is my
personal which
Paige there are a couple of my own
products on there because I was just
testing it out but it's basically really
really fun and a great way to shop your
Instagram feeds and shop your favorite
bloggers style and it's where I put most
of my outfits so if you want to really
easily have my kind of clothing and
outfits on your phone if you're shopping
and you turn a little bit it inspo you
can always go to the app and find out
the outfit so that's really really good
fun really useful great way to discover
new bloggers as well I've found so many
nice outfits on that app so I thought I
would let you know about it I'm actually
gonna be running a giveaway on the app
