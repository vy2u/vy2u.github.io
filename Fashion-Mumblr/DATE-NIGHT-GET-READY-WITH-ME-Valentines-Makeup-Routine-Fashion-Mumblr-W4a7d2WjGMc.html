ready for a Valentine's Day date night
from skincare and makeup to hair and
outfit I like to have a bit of a pamper
before getting ready so I'm starting off
with Elizabeth Arden's super start skin
renewal mask
it's got hyaluronic acid to balance
moisture levels and I love the glow that
it gives to my skin
I leave that on for 15 minutes or so
before patting the access into my skin
once that's absorbed I apply my deal
Hydra life serum it's hydrating offers a
gentle peel and also boosts radiance
then my usual is L moisturizer it's
lightweight made with naturally active
ingredients including avocado and plant
oils and stops my skin from getting dry
plus is quickly absorbed so I don't have
to wait around before applying my makeup
the final pre makeup step is applying
the charlotte tilbury youth glow this is
a color correcting and anti shadow
primer it evens out my complexion and
creates the glow from within look which
is perfect for date night all right time
for the base I'm mixing two favorite
foundations to get the perfect finish
both la mer soft fluid and bare minerals
bare Pro are packed with skin loving
ingredients by mixing bare Pro into the
soft fluid it adds a little bit more
coverage but without making my look
cakey or too heavy I blend the two on my
hand before creating a flawless finish
with my Beauty Blender taking it down my
neck over my eyelids and gently blending
right up to my hairline I brighten the
under eye area with by Terry's terribly
Danza Lee concealer using the warmth
from my finger to blend initially and
then I buff it in with my makeup sponge
not only does a concealer brighten but
it also boosts the skin's natural
production of collagen and elastin so
it's a win-win for any blemishes I'm
using glossy a stretch concealer it
blends so well with my skin and is
undetectable not cakey in the slightest
when I finish my base I fixed the
products in place with a misting of the
armani Prima makeup fix spray it's a
refreshing step of my beauty routine and
noticeably helps with the longevity of
my look as well I like to moisturize my
lips ahead of applying lipstick later on
and my current fave is the by Terry
hyaluronic sheer glow balm with
hyaluronic acid it airbrushes the lips
smoothes any wrinkles and gives 8 hours
of hydration and a beautiful tint of
color next I touch up my base with the
wire cell souffle Dhokla
this incredible powder actually makes my
skin more luminous in
of mattifying which i love as well as
setting my makeup I apply sparingly with
a front brush all over my complexion
it's on to brows next and I'm using the
Anastasia brow Wiz to create fine
hairlike strokes to fill out the brow
shape
I'm applying dossiers boi brow to fix
them in place and it also helps to
thicken and fill in my sparse brows
possibly my favorite step is when I add
color and warmth to my complexion I'm
using invisible bronze from bareMinerals
it's incredibly natural and I apply all
over for a sunkissed look and the
mineral infused formula gives a
beautiful glow as I've spent all day in
the Sun also from bare minerals I apply
a light dusting of blush from the you
had me at a globe Hallett which is such
a beautiful and versatile palette we
move on to eyes and I'm using the soft
brown shades from my new by Terry
eyeshadow palette this mushroomy brown
makes for the perfect allover lid shade
and I'm using my zoeva brush to apply it
then that's my bare minerals palette for
a darker shade which I apply to the
crease I add definition to the lashline
with my brown Marc Jacobs eyeliner it's
a very soft pencil and smudges easily
into the lashes finally I curl the
lashes and apply the Clinique high
definition mascara for voluminous but
still fluttery lashes I want a little
more definition on my cheekbones so I
reach for the la Mer bronzer I like to
swipe the brush across the darker shades
and sweep under my cheekbones the final
touch for my complexion is a delicate
application of the Istana wrong to shoot
at low shots it gives a lovely
long-lasting juhi glow and I adore the
pearly and hydrating color and
consistency for lipliner
I use the pink shade from the Clarins
full color pen it's a soft and waxy
formula and the perfect beige pink shade
I fill in my lips with a kiss proof
Estee Lauder pure color Envy paint on
matte liquid lipstick I absolutely love
the color of this and it really doesn't
budge no matter how many cocktails I'm
sipping on another misting of the armani
makeup fix to set my entire makeup look
and I'm treating myself to some lovely
hand cream Joe Malone's peony and blush
suede to ensure I have super soft hands
for hand-holding on date night back into
the boudoir and I'm curling my hair just
loosely with the THD creative pearl wand
alternating the direction of each curl
for extra volume and a slightly undone
look
a new step to my routine which I'm
loving is applying a misting of the
black opium hair mist
it's amazing how strong the centers from
a light misting and the formula is
created with argan oil so it really
nourishes the hair as well once I'm
dressed I combine the scent with the
Mongol on fragrance this one is
Charlie's favorite on me so I always
wear it on date night I pop my
essentials into my bag and we're ready
to go I've opted for an embellished net
and metallic midi skirt for date night
finished with some beautiful luxe
accessories to complete the look I think
this is a great date night outfit for
this time of year you're still warm and
it's practical but still very elegant
pretty and stylish I hope you enjoyed
game-ready with me and thank you so much
