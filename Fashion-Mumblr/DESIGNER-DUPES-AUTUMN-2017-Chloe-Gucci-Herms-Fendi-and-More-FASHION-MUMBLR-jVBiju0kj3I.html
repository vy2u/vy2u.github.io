going to be my autumn fashion at dupes
video long-awaited I did this video in
summer and it went down so well it seems
that you guys are just as obsessed with
dupes as I am and I feel like I found
some really great pieces across the high
street for the upcoming autumnal months
we've got a mixture of accessories I've
got some shoes some boots and we've got
some handbags and some clothing as well
and also this time and I don't feel like
I did have this category in my last
video we have some really great jewelry
troops as well which I'm very excited to
show you so if like me you love to get
that slightly more luxurious look but
you don't want to spend a fortune on the
real deal every single time
then dupes are a fabulous way of really
elevating that outfit to get that
designer look but at a fraction of the
price tag on that note if you haven't
seen my video how to look expensive
which has a little bit crazy I think
it's nearly like half a million views
now some very strange comments on that
yeah I check that out I'll leave that
linked up one way or the other and down
the description box for more ways of how
to elevate your outfit and get that more
expensive look without spending an
absolute fortune so I'm going to get
straight stuck into it to show you the
bits under pieces that I have picked up
from the high street okay so I'm gonna
get started with probably my favorite
dupe and I actually toyed around with
the idea of only getting myself a dupe
for a long time but I did end up caving
and getting the Chloe Susanna boots and
I went for the brown suede with gold
detailing on them I have no regrets I
absolutely adore them but I appreciate
that spending
don't even know how much they were it's
a little bit painful to even talk about
it but it's not an affordable purchase
it's not something that everyone can
afford so I did also look for some dupes
just to offer you guys an alternative
and just to make myself aware of what
was on the high street
these I'm actually borrowing from April
she picked up some amazing dupes and
they are from office yeah office and the
color of these is absolutely gorgeous
it's obviously not the same color as the
original Chloe ones they are more pinky
dusky tone but they have very similar
study
very similar strap detail they're
basically very much inspired by the Cloe
shoes they look fabulous but they are a
fraction of the prices I thought they
were probably the best deal of my
closest our boots there's also a really
lovely Jeep on misguided there are more
burgundy color which is fabulous for
autumn though I'm going to leave a few
different options for closes and oops
down in the description box below so
just click show more and you'll see the
links for all of those pieces I'd also
been on the lookout for some dupes for
Chloe bags and while this is not a real
kind of copycat tooth which I actually
like the fact that it's not a major copy
this definitely has Khloe vibes about it
this bag was 25 pounds I adore the round
shape you're probably recognize this bag
if you follow me on instagram or if you
watched my recent high street haul
videos I mentioned it in that one but
the new heavy bag is round I think it's
called like a tambourine shape so I felt
that this had personal vibes too that
just such an amazing price tag whether
or not you care that it looks a bit
designer inspired doesn't really matter
because this is a beautiful bag either
way and a 25 pounds it's just a fabulous
way of injecting that kind of boho
designer feel into your outfit also
along similar lines I picked up these
two how and decided which color
combination I'm going to keep yet
probably the burgundy because I was on
the lookout for a dupe or a high street
inspired bag that was similar to my
Chloe Niall bag in the beautiful oxford
wine color it also has vibes from the
chloe drew the saddle shape is a little
bit more of a Chloe drew vibe and this
one you can't use the ring as a handle
like you can on the Chloe no but either
way it's a beautiful design feature
you've got this long strap so very very
versatile and again just a really great
way of adding that designer touch to
your autumn outfit so you've got it in
Burgundy and there's slightly more
practical tan color and as I have the
round on in town I think I'm going to
keep the red one so let me know your
opinions but again these were only 25
pounds each so fabulous value and
got to that very much design feel about
them so this next piece is probably the
most versatile and most loosely termed
dupe in this video this is a camel
colored coat from River Island it was
think 75 pounds possibly 69 as I said
before all the links will be down below
so you can check them out if you want to
shop anything but this is pretty much a
dupe or a high street edit for so many
camel coats camel coats are a real
autumn essential and you'll find so many
of them over the 200 pound mark in shops
like whistles French Connection Rhys all
of those premium high street stores and
designer will have camel colored coats
in this season I hope so you fell head
over heels in love with one from Max
Mara but I think it was over a thousand
pounds so I had it on my radar to look
out for an affordable alternative and
this is all that I chose I also have
this coat in a blush color which I adore
and I've been wearing so much it's very
warm it's got a lining it feels very
well made and it just looks so much more
expensive in its price tag so while it
may not be a direct copy or directly
inspired by anything from the catwalk
it's very much a duo of higher-end
styles and certainly coats with a more
expensive price tag also from River
Island is a pair of dupes
or very similar style shoes to my Gucci
mules so these were I'm not sure the
exact price of these but definitely in
the hundreds they're beautiful pony skin
and I decided to invest in these because
they're a very standout piece the
leopard print I feel just really lifts
up an outfit definitely is a
conversation piece and yeah no regrets
with those but I wanted to show you guys
these ones so from River Island great
quality once again very much the same
kind of vibes as the Gucci mules but a
fraction of the price tag they have a
very similar effect on your overall
outfit and because they're a Ryland I'm
really impressed with the quality
there are beautiful soft material
they've got this gold bit on the heel
which you can actually see when you're
wearing it and I think that's just a
really nice design detail and then
you've got this shiny gold wood covered
horse bit detail again similar to the
Gucci so so far from looking on a high
street needs the best at dupes to the
Gucci mules that I have
and very very peace with those so if you
are the viewer that actually Jung told
me about these thank you very much
because yes you enabled this purchase
okay so this shoe you may be like Josie
we've seen you wearing these a million
times but I wanted to talk about them
again because I picked them up in a new
colorway so over summer I bought and
wore to death the white versions of
these if you're not sure what I'm on
about
they are the groups of the MS sandals
the EMAs ones I think are I think
they're 109 five four thousand pounds
repair sandals which even for Shopaholic
over here that is cray cray so when I
saw that she and we're doing 20 pound
thirds I just bought them so quickly so
the white ones because I wore them so
much and I actually ended up throwing
them away last week because they were
falling apart I wore them more than any
other shoe this summer decided to pick
up the brown version so that's what I
wanted to share with you these in this
video I know that I'll get so much use
out of these even if it's not the rest
of this year because obviously we're
going into winter I know I'll get so
much use out of these next summer and
who knows if they'll still be around the
brown color looks very similar to the
EMAs ones and with the white stitching I
think it's just a really nice design
detail again making them look a lot more
expensive than they were so very very
happy with this purchase next up and we
are whistling through the years
hopefully this is gonna be quite a
snappy video we have a kind of dupe
slush high-street inspired version of
the cult guy bags now I absolutely love
the cult guy bags and a lot of my
favorite Instagram has had them and I
did think about going there but then I
thought you know what it's just a little
bit too impractical for that price tag
so when I saw this one in Zara again I
snapped it up it's a different shape to
the cockier but because of this kind of
worden effect it's very much inspired by
that designer and then inside you also
get this dust bag because I've heard a
lot of people saying how it's a bit
weird that you can see everything that's
inside your kogai bag so very practical
that this does come with a little kind
of drawstring bag inside to protect the
modesty of your items
for any Wintersun holidays that I may
have or you know saving us again for
next summer I thought this was a really
lovely bag goop or not and $29.99 so
very affordable to so this next item is
probably my favorite dupe of the entire
video have I said that before I don't
know if I have to scratch that because
these are my favorites
these are dukes of the Nicholas Kirkwood
Black Pearl in heeled boots which last
autumn I came very close to purchasing
so glad I didn't because you could
literally play spot the difference and
almost definitely lose because these are
so similar
they're also weather again you care
about them being dupes or not they're
just beautiful beautiful shoes at for
autumn they are an autumn wardrobe
essential who doesn't wear black boots
in autumn and the heel height and these
gives you a little bit of a boost but
you could definitely wear these all day
they're from ego not sure if I mentioned
that already
I'm so very easy to get them shipped
very easy delivery etc not sure if
they're global or if it's just UK
delivery but um if I find a global link
or Us link I'll leave that link to down
below as well but I just think an
absolute stunning beautiful practical
black boot with pals in the heel which
just adds a feminine touch that I adore
if you watched my romantic lookbook you
may know that I have a pair of Nicolas
Kirkwood white flat shoes with a pearl
in the heel and that design detail just
makes my heart flutter I love it so so
much so you'll be seeing me wearing
these a lot in the coming weeks and I
think they were around the 29 pound mark
but I do know that they were very very
affordable so yes I love those okay so
next we reach the slightly more
controversial part of this haul because
these bags I can't really say if they're
dupes or downright copies of the
designer versions of these bags no
prizes for guessing what this is a dupe
of it is God I'm gonna say that and I'll
get it wrong I think it's Abdulrahman
bag but yeah it was a lot smaller than I
thought it was going to be the do bag is
probably double the size of this but
design wise almost identical I bought it
out of pure intrigue then we have this
dupe flash copy of the Gucci Darnassus
bag I have the dialysis blooms bag which
I'm so excited to wear again and
I loved it so much that I'd do
potentially maybe one day want to get a
new one but I thought I'd just kind of
get the cute for now and see how much
you say get out of it or if I just end
up using my blooms one over and over
again which is quite likely either way I
think this is a really beautiful bag if
you would never ever buy a Gucci bag but
really loved the design and this is a
really lovely option it does have a
longer chain strap inside it's got this
same kind of clasp as the darkness bags
fairly spacious you're not gonna fit
your laptop in like you can with my
darkness is bloom but it's a great bag
nonetheless and then finally she in a
cute wise we have this little number
which I thought was just a really cute
evening bag it's kind of inspired by the
Fendi bags with the scalloped edging but
I don't really care that it's Fendi
inspired I thought it's a really lovely
evening bag love the pink love a gold
detail love the scalloped edges so yeah
those are my three - the haggis ruching
find myself if any other youtubers get
really hot and smart eating while
filming their videos let me know the
comments below because I always get
really really flustered which you can
probably tell because I just dropped
part from my own bags so we're getting
to the last few pieces now and my next
tube is an incredible one and is a
jewelry tube one of the rings that I
wear 90% of the time is my Monica
vinegar river ring this retails at
around 160 pounds it has little diamonds
in it and it is beautiful it's such an
elegant and feminine ring but of course
that price point is not a nephrons
budget you may not want to spend that
much on a ring and if not and you love
the style this is such a fabulous
bargain this was from accessorized it
looks pretty much identical to the
Monica Vanetta ring is made with a think
cubic zirconium which is just
beautifully sparkly a really good
diamond dupe this was under 20 pounds so
very very affordable and it's just
absolute beautiful rose gold band and
I'll insert close-ups here so you can
see just how similar it is to the Monica
Villa de Riva ring within that
collection from accessorize they were
quite a few dupes and I did go through
all of the ones that I picked up in my
haul video from some
so definitely check that out if you want
to see a few more accessorized oops
because there are so many good ones
my next jewelry Joop however is this
necklace from Topshop so I've been
wearing my MS OMA London necklace quite
a lot recently this is becoming one of
those cliche blogger items because we
all have one they're so beautiful
it's from the Lucy Williams McDermott
collection and it's is kind of upside
down horn it's a really effective
actually looks great with like white
tops it looks great with bikinis it
would look pretty cool with this but
it's quite expensive so when I saw this
one in Topshop very very similar not
quite so sparkly a different style of
chain but very very similar to than the
same one at this one I think was part of
a set that was round the ten or twelve
pound mark so a really lovely way of
getting that vibe but without spending
the over hundred pound price tag off
this one third jewelry dupe is this
bracelet a game from accessorize a game
with beautiful cubic zirconia in the
band this one is just very similar five
to Monika Vanita again I feel like I
know where they put their inspiration
for this range from but it's just
beautifully affordable and really nice
if you like to buy a lot of jewelry as
opposed to investing in a few key pieces
this is very similar to the Fiji
bracelets of Monica Vernon to do I do
actually is still wear my Monaco vinegar
ones it's by no way a replacement but
just a nice way of me adding something a
little bit new and fresh into my jewelry
collection so once again these will be
linked down below so check them out so
second to last and the last two are all
clothing pieces and we have these
jumpers so spot the difference one of
these is about 160 pounds from Rhys the
other one is I think 22 pounds from hmm
I do know which one is which place your
bets now a4 which one is which
I got rumba bitch named Rick she got it
right so these two jumpers are
incredibly incredibly similar but the
price tag is very different I absolutely
love this jumper from Rhys I have worn
it so much it's just such a beautiful
elegant and very feminine jumper and it
just seems to work with so many things
really lifts a lot of outfits but then
hmm I have one that is almost identical
very very similar it's got
same cuts on the neckline the same rib
detail of the fabric the same actually
the only difference is that the sleeves
are not cuffed on the H&amp;amp;M one I do
really like that the sleeves are cuffed
on the Reese one but do I like that
design detail enough to pay a hundred
and forty pound more I don't know both
beautiful jumpers but if I had the
choice to buy them again I would
probably go for this one
last but not least saving what could
potentially be the best to last this is
a dupe of a dupe so in my last video
which was my summer tips I mentioned
earlier I told you about a river island
sweet jacket that was again the jeep of
a Reese way jacket so the river island
one was around sixty pounds and whereas
the Reese one I think was over three
hundred pounds but I've managed to
better at this time and I now have a
dupe of the river island site jacket
it's like a dupe inception so I actually
have one of you guys to thank for this
jacket discovery because in a recent
haul I was talking about a river island
suede jacket but because it was real
suede it was a hundred and twenty pounds
which I felt was a lot for something I
didn't know if I was going to wear on up
so summing and ahhing about it and then
one of you guys kindly let me know the
comments that new-look had weren't very
similar
this one was $39.99 40 pounds a fraction
of the cost of the river island one and
I can't even think about how much
cheaper it would be than maybe an All
Saints or a Reese suede jacket so a
really really great bargain again design
detail wise so similar you got studs in
the same places you've got this kind of
brushed silver cross body zip same
structuring and then you've got the
seams that really do make it look like
suede it's not suede it's not even first
Wade it's kind of like a soft velvety
material but I find this material so
comfortable to wear and it just looks
great as well so big fan of this one
so those are my or terminal fashion
dupes I really hope you guys will enjoy
looking through these with me as always
please let me know if you spot any dupes
on the high street and let me know
because I'd love to check them out and
if I find any more I might do another
one of these videos as like a winter
dupes solo
if you'd like to see that and also if
there are any products that you have
seen it there are maybe a little bit too
expensive then let me know if you would
like me to search for dupes of them on
my radar slash a list of dupes to find
at the moment is definitely the open
East year wise man boots again if you've
got any deep recommendations let me know
because I'm obsessed with them but
they're like 700 quid so don't want to
spend that much money anyway I really
hope you enjoyed this do give it a
thumbs up if you like these kind of
videos and thumbs up for more fashion
