for today's video I'm going to be
sharing with you a few dupes that I've
found on the high street recently so a
lot of these are things that are very
much inspired by things that we may have
seen from our favorite designers on
catwalks recently but of course because
they argue they are just a fraction of
the price I'm gonna be sharing with you
a few of my favorites quick disclaimer
it's 26 degrees today
hence my hair thing scrapes back so if I
look a little bit hot and flustered
that's because I am didn't even think I
needed to invest in aircon in this house
but apparently I do so that's the site
please forgive me if I just let me go by
red onion get started with with probably
my favorite view so far so obviously in
most of these cases
I'm not going to also own the designer
ones but in this particular case I do
the bitch is blouse this one cost around
the 25 pound mark whereas this is a
self-portrait one I believe this was
over 250 I think I got this at about 40%
off in the nether portal sale and that
one's in December but it seems gone back
up to full price but when I got this
during Fashion Week I thought I was such
a fabulous juice and I actually has been
getting a lot more use out of this one
then I have the self portrait I guess
because it's just so expensive I really
just save this for special occasions
where as I've been wearing jeans I've
been wearing it with like high-waisted
skirts and I've been going to so so much
use out of it obviously there are a lot
of design details are very similar it's
got the lace panel at the top we've got
the very high neck collar and I actually
prefer the speeds on this one they're
like too displeased and then both of
them are
take down at the bottom so a lot of
similarities without it being a real
copycat job so everything I mentioned
obviously reduced and the higher end
pieces will be down below in the
description box so you can click on
those if you want to find out more or
treat yourself to any of the pieces that
I talked about in this video you'll also
see in my description box a little bit
more about affiliate links how they work
where they are so if you want to have
read about those because a lot of my
links are affiliate links there guys
also down in the description box next up
is this one and if you follow me on
Instagram or have been watching any of
my vlogs recently they'll probably
recognized as come back I find it very
similar style wise to be Niall bags and
Chloe which I do love I'm just not sure
if I pay that amount of money for a
handbag of this ilk I do really like the
bracelet style cause this one is very
very roomy I think it was either $25.99
or $29.99
either way very affordable and I've been
doing a ton of use out of this already I
actually wear it around my wrist
Shawn more than I thought I would do but
I also find it really useful that it's
got a shoulder strap I really like the
fact with this yellow gold detail as
well something a little bit different I
do wear lots of rose gold but yes it is
certainly inspired by the Chloe bags at
a fraction of the cost and really easy
you want to pick up on the high street
or online okay next up I have two
jackets like absolutely adore but there
is one heck of a price difference
reduced you as well this one here is 58
pounds and this one is 395 so a real
humongous price difference here this one
is from Reese and I adore it this one I
got first it's a real investment piece
this is Lewis beautiful quality blush
pink suede which I love I didn't think
that this would be my stylist or by
selling over the color there are a few
of these designs on the high street at
the moment I think all things have got
one with tassels as well but this was
the one for me it's simple enough but it
also has some lovely details you've got
this pewter brushed silver you've got a
little difficult a waist belt and it
fits so beautifully I wore this in my
spring trends look book which I'll leave
a link down below if you want to see
this in action but then I spotted this
one from River
so this is the 58 pounds one it's so
suede it's not lined so it's I mean
obviously it's going to be lower quality
than well that's 395 pounds but it's
still a really lovely jacket I also
really love the color of this one more
of a baby's pink and it's a very very
soft material I would argue that this is
actually more comfortable and also
because it is more affordable I don't
worry about it so much my reece one has
actually got a little bit of glue on it
from where it's rubbed too close against
my jeans which as you can imagine is
just so upsetting this one has got
yellow gold details where three from is
pewter very similar in style very
similar in color but very different in
price here is another Cloe tube and I
say juice loosely here because actually
I'm kind of wondering whether this is
more of like a ripoff of the real thing
because yes it doesn't have the Chloe
logo but they really haven't used their
imagination here when it comes to the
design it's pretty much identical to the
Chloe a backside I don't have a Chloe
feedback type so I don't know the ins
and outs of them but I do know this
looks very very similar and even
probably pal is pretty low quality this
came from a website called she in which
a lot of you are very interested in
we've seen a lot of pieces and they're
very designer inspired I didn't have any
problems with shipping I didn't have any
problems with paying importunities I
think it's a Chinese company and but
yeah it arrived at you finding no issues
with that but obviously don't so it's a
little higher quality with their pieces
if you really like a design style and
you can't afford it or you don't want to
spend that amount of money or maybe you
want to see how something fits some of
your wardrobe before investing in the
full price design item then juice are
often a really good option if it really
is like the total designer if also and
it is pretty poor quality I might wear a
couple times maybe for like if I go to
any festivals or beach parties things
like that but yeah it's not such good
quality as the UK high street things
that I've shown you previously but stay
tuned because I do have some other
things from chien that I am more
impressed with so the main thing that
I'm impressed with from Shion is the
issues so can you guys tell which are
these Stuart Weitzman ones and which
machine ones place your bets now that's
done okay so these the Chien one these
cost around 20 pound mark that they are
of course very very similar to your
white the ones which are a lot more
expensive I adore these you've probably
seen my maps at Lowe's I think that's
beautiful that's such a gorgeous color
very comfortable great heel height they
do get a little bit dirty though if any
of you guys know how I can fix that and
please let me know I've tried a few
different things but she in once again
have just totally ripped off the design
they the only real difference and they
do have these in pink as well is that
the pearls are bigger that's literally
it
and the around the Pearl is a little bit
more shiny but there's hardly anything
in it I don't know I would realized it
some brownies that they were a dupe I
probably would jump to the conclusion
that they are real I find this so
strange I've seen this with a lot of
like boob shoes they don't use the
buckle in the real way you kind of like
slots the buckle into this little clasp
which I find very odd like why do they
not just do the normal buckle maybe they
have to have a design detail that's very
different in order for it to be not
classified as a copy
who knows if you guys know why then
again let me know but once again these
are really comfortable I think they do
look great and I'm deafening around
these a lot this summer as well as my
Stuart Weitzman ones from Russ and Raman
next up I've got a couple of pairs of
shoes which are dupes
kind of for Chanel shoes so they're not
reduced because they don't look
identical in any way and that they're
very much inspired by Chanel especially
with its black toe cap these ones here
are from chien as well they've got a
little pearl in the heel which i think
is a really lovely effect and I would
love to one day maybe only Chanel ones
but they are so so expensive both these
for under 30 pounds very affordable and
a really nice way to see how much you
wear a style before investing
these ones I have been wearing a lot so
apologies they are a little bit battered
but I think these look so high-end with
white jeans they look absolutely
beautiful
I've also been wearing them with dresses
these are from Topshop
they also have the black toe cap and so
they're so affordable I have a feeling
these were about
- nine pounds but as I said everything
will be linked down below of countries
of cotton of the exact price it was
about six to eight weeks ago that I
ordered these and I have worn them so so
much I'm sure these probably look
familiar for quite a few of you because
I have seen them all as my Instagram
recently I was inspired by these thanks
to another blogger sinead whose
Instagram is beautiful I'll leave it
link down below but she will be and I
just have him straight away I have been
toying with the idea of getting the
Gucci mules but they are just so
expensive Dickens on you puppies also
taken a liking to chewing my Zara
noodles that are like this which I would
have included in this video but these
are a much better juice but I will leave
as our once link down below in case you
fancy those but yeah so these are very
chilly inspired by the Gucci shoes
pretty much all the design details are
very similar
you've got the buckle you've got the fur
on the inside it's mule I find these
incredibly comfortable I've been wearing
them a lot both in the house is kind of
slippers and out of the house the one
thing I would say with these is
definitely to size up I got my normal
size and I do feel they're a little bit
small whereas when I wear my mum because
she also bought them she's a size bigger
than me and basic perfectly well on the
sheen website I also picked up this bag
obviously the style of it is very
similar Saddleback style to the Chloe
tree bags which I absolutely adore I do
actually have another cute from an
American website called Jessica Bowman
but this one that is well aware is a
different style to ones that Chloe
actually make I don't think Chloe have
anywhere these kind of studs on them I
think it's a really beautiful Browns got
this lock detail which is rather
specific actually and then once you do
get inside it's got this little bit
section so it's a little bit more secure
than other dupes that I've seen which is
completely open you do have to chain
strap the same as the Chloe bags whether
you see this as a juice or not I think
this is a really lovely bag if you've
got lots of summer beach parties
festivals pool parties even just general
summer where I think it's a beautiful
bag forget the fact that it is very much
inspired by Chloe I just love it I think
it's very pretty
and I'm going to bring this a lot this
summer and finally I picked up this
because it's quite a random piece but I
feel have a really nice strap for my
camera obviously
oh my god works
that Fendi are doing these kind of
straps at the moment for their bio I
think it's a really lovely way to just a
little bit more fun to expand it back he
already have
I saw Leone from okra sure adding her
friendly structure her Valentino bag I
really like that effect and this is
definitely filtering down to the high
street at the moment this one again was
from Chien I think it does look very
very similar to the designer ones but
again at a fraction of the cost the
leather underneath is like that so
Saffiano leather does that kind of
scratchy leather that isn't very durable
so yeah I'm going to put this on my
camera I think that should look quite
cute
and I wouldn't have spent the amount of
monies as a designer one bar for a very
heavily embellished chemist wrap but
this I am pretty good group so those are
my favorite queues that are available on
the high streets at the moment I really
hope you guys enjoy this video something
a bit different from me let me know what
you thought about it and give it a
thumbs up if you'd like to see me doing
things like this maybe a video like this
a refusin just let me know let me know
your thoughts and that's all from me so
thank you so much for watching I will
see you in my next on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
