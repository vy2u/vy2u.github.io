vlog for fashion mumbler of log Toba I
say proper daily vlog because I know a
lot of my vlogs recently have been like
over a couple of days or they've been
kind of lifestyle videos and I wanted to
do a real kind of day in the life video
so today is Monday and it's my I guess
you could say it's my admin day and
Monday's are just the days when I try
not to do any meetings I try and just
stay home all day and get stuff done and
the lighting is really weird in here for
filming so I apologize about that
so today um I thought I would vlog
because it might be quite interesting to
share with you the kind of things that
are blogger does on a daily basis that's
not the I don't to say not the fun side
but not the glamorous side and maybe a
few things that you just you just kind
of don't realize what what we do behind
the scenes because there's so much stuff
and myself and other bloggers we talk
about this all the time we're like oh I
wish you could see like the stuff that
goes on that you don't see like not the
meetings not the fun events not the
photoshoots
not even the filming of the videos and
the writing of the blogpost because I
guess you kind of you know that we have
to do that as well as the just
publishing but today monday is one of
those days where I'm just going to get
on with the other stuff because my to-do
list has been growing and growing and
growing and in fact I've got like a huge
to-do list in my head so the first thing
going to do is write out a proper to-do
list but just to give you an idea today
and then we tackling my inbox so I've
got tons and tons of emails I've got to
reply to I've also got a few calls with
brands so I'm going to be making a few
phone calls and to discuss projects that
you might be working on together so a
lot of my time is taken up by talking to
brands especially but I have time to
meet them and then also I met my
accountant on Friday and let's just say
I've not been very good at keeping track
of my finances like my receipts because
when you're a blogger a lot of us wear
our own companies with sole traders or
self-employed which means we have to
keep track of receipts and like expenses
so a lot of people when they work for a
company they put our expenses through
and someone else deals with them like
the financial team but we have to do all
of that ourselves so today is going to
be a fun day of doing kind of accounting
things as well I also need to set up a
business bank account because my
accountants that I need to do that so
yeah a lot of admin I've also got to go
to the post office because
I borrowed some sunglasses for shoot so
I've got to go and return those um I've
got a few contracts to read through so
it's not going to be a glamorous day but
I thought I would vlog today because it
should be fairly interesting for you to
see the other things that bloggers get
up to and basically why we're always so
busy everyone said oh but you just
you're on holiday or you're going out
doing photo shoots well actually there
is so so so much that goes on behind the
scenes as well as the stuff that you
guys see so that's you're going to be
having little glimpse into in today's
video so first thing on my to-do list is
to write a to-do list so that's not
going to do now try and get a few of
these thoughts off my mind and onto
paper so I can just have the
satisfaction of taking them off as I do
them so let's find a pen and paper and
write that this
okay my to-do list is done I've tied my
hair up this is pretty much how I look
every day when I'm working from home I
have my casual and comfy jumper on this
one is from what's that shop brandy
melville I got this just the first time
I I went into the store and I normally
just clip my hair away from my face
using one of these hairdresser clips so
yeah this is pretty much what I look
like every day when I work from home and
my to-do list is actually not looking
too long
that's these tasks are quite big so I've
got some really fun things on it like
make sure I go through the process to
register myself for v80 because my
accountants that I need to do that um I
have got to also as I said set up
business bank account I've got to film
some clips for a mask I did haul video I
need to take some blog photos for this
one sort of blog post and I don't know
about other bloggers but when a post is
sponsored when I have to take the photos
it always kind of feels like homework so
I always put them off but yeah I need to
do those today before the lighting goes
luckily it's quite nice and bright
outside so hopefully should be good for
photos I have got to fill out a couple
of contracts and send those back I've
got tons of emails to do I've had a
sponsor blog post come back to me from a
brand and they've made some edits so I
need to go through and edit that and
also with the video I've had a video
come back that needs some edits so when
we work with a brand when bloggers work
with brands and bloggers obviously get
like 90% of the creative freedom but
sometimes a brand wants like specific
messages to be said in a certain way or
um you know they just want to make
changes because after all if they are
sponsoring a blog post or sponsoring a
video then a video is kind of an ADD for
them so they should have or they do want
final control over what is said in the
video if that makes sense which is a
little bit annoying especially if we
have to re-film things because then it
means you have to we have to be film the
whole thing if it's video because you
can't just like suddenly have different
hair and makeup so that's something that
takes a long time luckily I don't think
I'm going to have to refill I'm just
gonna have to switch some bits arounds
and cop some bits out and so I'm going
to do that today and I've got
cool with a brand in about four minutes
at half past 12 and we're going to be
talking about a collaboration it might
be going like Christmas so I am going to
prepare myself for that cool just reread
over some old emails and I'll chat you
guys off of that I might go get myself a
fresh cup of tea to have during the cool
okay so I've had my call and now it's
back to emails and so let me give you an
idea of what like a bloggers inbox
entails so a few of my emails for this
morning are trying to get dates and
Diaries so trying to catch up with
people trying to have meetings and I've
got a load of event invitations quite a
few of them I'm not able to go to so I'm
just sending RSVPs just being polite
just let them know I can't go sadly and
I've got some emails from browsers
letting me know about some new brands
are they looking after some new product
ranges and I'm reading through some
press releases um and a brand has just
got in touch with me inviting me out for
a day with them on Wednesdays a pretty
last minute so I'm just trying to
rearrange my diary which is pretty
little bit challenging but you know
that's what we're doing and then let's
see what else I sent over an invoice to
around and I didn't fit out properly so
I've got to go out go through the
invoice and put in their correct details
and arranging a breakfast with a brand
this company we're trying to sort our
contract together and we just going
through a few of the particular details
and in the contract and now I've got
email from the PR who helped me with my
eyebrows to try and arrange another date
to go in for and getting them re--
tattooed talking to a company about
snapchat campaign um rewriting a few
edits for a blog post that I'm working
on
so yeah loads and loads of emails to be
getting on with I have been doing emails
so far for two hours this morning and
I've not even reached um
Friday's emails because Friday I was in
Gloucester sudden get too many emails
but yeah this morning I've got you been
doing emails coming through today so
it's going to be quite a long day of
emails so before I get sucked in again
I'm going to go and take a few video
clips for the video which is hopefully
going to go live tonight because that
one
is against I'm working with a brand for
that one you probably have already seen
it so I'm gonna go and take some video
clips and then it's gonna be back into
the inbox so I was just trying to take
some blog photos on the bed and somebody
decided that I'd created rather comfy
area didn't you mad Annie so I now have
a little bit of help yes I'm talking
about you mister sausage complete change
of outfit since you last saw me because
I just did a few blog photos and then I
decided to put my pajamas on afterwards
because we felt more comfortable and so
as you just saw that little clip I was
just taking some photos on the bed
including a fluffy blanket and then
Dexter decided to make himself at home
there and somehow taking blog photos has
just taken me over an hour so it's now 2
o'clock and I feel like I haven't even
takes one thing off my to-do list so I'm
going to spend the next hour getting the
video for tonight although I don't even
think there's enough time to get up
tonight done and then I've got to send
it across to the brand to make sure
they're happy with it so who knows you
may not even seen it by now and so yeah
I'm gonna do a little bit of editing God
knows and I'm going to have time for
lunch but luckily I did have a big
breakfast so it should be ok my emails I
can see that in the time that I've been
doing photos I have 188 unread emails so
oh it's just never ending so I'm just
going to put the vlogging camera down
for a little bit get some editing done
and then I'll let you know my progress
in a couple of hours oh my gosh you guys
it is now four o'clock and when did I
last speak to you I feel like it felt
like is about two hours ago but I don't
really know um but I've managed to get
two things ticked off my to-do list
which is just insane considering is four
o'clock and I've just not even completed
half my to-do list which is just insane
I wanted to have done so much today but
everything takes so much longer and I
don't procrastinate like I don't spend
ages going on Facebook or like I don't
even go on Instagram like I haven't even
posted an Instagram photo since
breakfast this morning so I have not
procrastinating I even would say that
the biggest distraction is emails like
when emails come in a lot of the time
you have to reply pretty quickly because
for example I was just talking to a
brand about an event that's going on on
Wednesday which is two days from now so
we're just going through the details for
that and I've got like deadlines coming
up so everything on email is pretty
urgent so I feel like I always just get
sucked into my inbox and I'm sorry I'm
happy with my hacks it's coming undone
and yeah I just can't seem to get
anything done with my inbox just
constantly pinging so that's why I tend
to wake up early and try and get as much
as I can done before 9 a.m.
because once the emails start pinging
and they're just such a distraction so
yeah my usual technique of getting up
super early and working before the
emails didn't really happen today
because I did have a breakfast thing um
and I don't think I properly sat down
started working to about 11:00 which is
really throwing me off so I've got a
video uploading right now and I don't
like to use my internet at the same time
because it just goes really really slow
which is a good excuse me to have a
break so I've come downstairs and I've
just seen these dates which has reminded
me that I bought them to make some
protein balls and I haven't actually
have any lunch how many and anything
since avocado on toast 1/2 10 this
morning so I'm going to make some
protein balls hopefully I've got the
rest of the ingredients they should be
super quick I've made them before we're
like with other people and they take
just a few minutes you just shove
everything in your blender or I've got
the Thermomix which is even better
um so I'm just gonna remind myself with
the recipe which is I think it's a
deliciously la one from Pinterest and
then I'm going to stick in some
pistachios just for good measure so
hopefully it won't take me too long to
make some of those and I've got
something nice to snack on
okay so everything has been blended
together and as you can see I've got my
nice little mixture in my hell mix and I
just taste a little bit hence why I'm
still licking my lips and it is
wonderful I actually have substituted a
few ingredients from deliciously Ella's
recipe I didn't have cocoa powder or
cacao and she wanted raw cacao which I
did not have but instead I have like a
chocolate protein powder which is not
quite the same but I did read the
ingredients I'll show you it's the green
superfood alkalizing an energizing
plant-based nutrition I don't know but
when I went to an event recently they
highly recommended this and I've got it
from Amazon so yeah I use that in sort
of cacao and then I put in um all the
rusty ingredients she recommended and it
tastes really really good
and personally when I have protein balls
I like to have something a little bit
more solid in there as well so I've got
the rest of the almonds from my pack
because recipe needed 200 grams and I
had 300 so I'm going to put an almond
inside a few of the balls or most of
them because it's nice to have a little
bit crunch and I love a good almond um
and I've also got some goji berries so I
might do a few of the balls just a
little go as you go to berries stuck in
there as well so next thing to do is
roll them out and then put them in the
fridge for an hour or so if I can
control myself and tilt them because
these are so so so yummy and also they
have got loads of almonds in them and
almonds contain magnesium which is
really good if you are a little bit low
on energy
so like right now half past four bit of
an energy slump these are absolutely
perfect for that really good for your
afternoon cup of herbal tea which is
definitely the next thing
it's actually amazing how few balls that
mixture makes I once you saw amount of
ingredients I was putting in the blender
that I was gonna be eating routine fools
for a week but actually I've only made
this trade here for the pools and then a
couple of spares
although Hank said that did he quite a
few while I was making them and the
awesome filling I must have had the
equivalent of like three balls but I
honestly feel really slow like I won't
be snacking until dinnertime that's for
sure so I'm now going to put these in
the fridge and let them set and they'll
be ready for munching and ourselves if
I'm even hungry already if I'm back in
the chair and it's back on with a little
bit more work I'm going to tackle a few
more emails it's now five o'clock so
this is just pretty much the last blast
of emails until everybody goes home and
really apart from me that is I always
just continue working until about nine
o'clock tonight probably because I have
got so much to do so just looking
through my emails now I've got a few
appointments to confirm I've got a few
press days to RSVP to I haven't even
started doing my financial stuff so I
still got to do the VAT registry I've
got an entire box full of receipts I
still got to go through and I've got a
few people chasing me for deadlines so
yeah tons and tons left to do and yeah
it's making me feel a little bit
overwhelmed if I'm honest that my to-do
list it's just really not that much
shorter if anything it's longer the
emails that I've got today are just
giving me more tasks to do so I might
write another to-do list and then just
crack on with some emails
so it's half-past six now and I have
just finished doing my emails they are
not done
I still haven't tackled Friday's emails
it was still just today's ones and but I
feel like everyone's left the office now
so I might as well just stop working
there's my team there's my inbox pinging
right now so obviously some people still
in the office
and but yeah I'm gonna stop doing emails
now and I'm going to edit some blog
photos edit some videos and get those
kind of bits and bobs done I've read a
few more emails first thing in the
morning before I go to the blogger event
um
dextra is currently shredding a
newspaper on the floors I need to clear
that up I'm going to yeah edit some blog
photos and edit a video get that
exporting and then I'm going to go down
to dawdle and pick up my blogger mail so
I don't know if I mentioned anything I
did but my blogger friend M Sheldon is
coming over tonight and her train
doesn't get into Kings Cross until nine
o'clock so she'll be coming over at
about half nine and so my aim is to
continue working all the way up till
then because I just want to like take
off as much as possible from my to-do
list and yeah I haven't really ticked
off that much so far that's M as we
speak so you just after nine um so yeah
I just got an email actually a few hours
ago now from a company called the global
program and they want me to do an
interview for them on a piece of their
writing so that's pregnant take me about
20 minutes to write ups event Ethan says
and then the blog photos I took today I
will just export them all and Lightroom
give those a bit of a tweaks and
frightening some lighting adjustments
and then edit some video clips so yeah
they'll be take me up until
eight o'clock to do those bits so I'm
going to crack on
once again throw this blob is already
not very exciting but I told you that
not every single day and I blow this
life is exciting there's a lot of days
at home
and you're just doing emails there's no
procrastination going on it's literally
just emails emails emails work do
something else - emails
apart from making those energy balls I
have literally not done anything apart
from work today so yeah not as fabulous
as you may think it is but I'm not
complaining because I love my job and
days like this are just part of it so
I'm just going to get crackin okay it is
half-past seven
and Dexter and I are done I cannot
concentrate anymore I'm such a morning
worker as opposed to an evening worker
um but yeah I have just spent the last
hours since I last spoke to you doing
emails I know I said I was going to stop
doing emails but they're like a vortex I
just can't you know I feel like I always
want to have a clear inbox otherwise a
cover lacks so I just ended up doing
emails um sorry I'm just trying to let
Dexter down off my lap there we go so I
haven't done the video that I was going
to do and I haven't edited the blog post
that I was going to do because emails
just take so long I feel like there's a
running theme in this video but yeah my
brain is not really working anymore so
I'm going to go down store all I have
packaged up some misguided returns so
I'm going to go down and drop them off
and collect some bloggers mail not going
to bother take my camera with me so I'll
see you guys um I'll probably be back
here just before 8 o'clock and we can
undo a little bit of them all together
and in case you can't tell I am mentally
exhausted back home again and I had to
carry three big bags full of blogger
mail but I can never complain about
carrying blogger mail because I'm always
just like I'm so lucky getting one of
this but my shoulders are killing me
from carrying those three big heavy bags
um I did actually unbox a load of it at
Dajjal because there were so many boxes
and I knew that a lot of it would just
be packaging and there's no
Caracara boxes so a lot of the blogger
mail is already unboxed but I will go
upstairs have a look through it in a few
minutes but first I'm going to put my
dinner on just turning the oven on and
and I went to M&amp;amp;S in Brixton and really
really lazy cheap mail
I've got a sweet and sour crispy chicken
banquet for one this is like the
ultimate single girl meal
I feel like crispy battered chicken with
sweet sour sauce a fried rice and wok
fried beef chow mein sounds absolutely
amazing and yeah I feel like if I was
single I would just eat all the
time because there's no motivation to
cook healthily for one person I don't
know I guess there is but it would take
me a long time to get used to that so
hope you're not single anytime soon they
have a morbid topic on that note Charlie
is a New Yorker today and tomorrow and
Wednesday
so that's why he's not here so I'm quite
thankful to have em coming over shortly
she will be what time is it twenty past
eight she'll be coming into Kings Cross
in less than an hour and she already be
with me an hour so not too much longer
all by my lonesome so yeah I'm going to
stick this chicken in and Wow look comes
with like a snazzy box did you go
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah yeah okay I'm
going to get to the oven and then I'll
head upstairs to show you what is in
today's bloggers mail
okay most of the blog email is now
unboxed and instead of going through
everything which would take a million
years I'm just going to show you a few
of my favorite pieces
