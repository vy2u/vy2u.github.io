six it's Sunday morning I'm feeling a
little bit fragile after last night's
party and for the lovely Vicky's
birthday hunt been acting quite a long
time so on yeah kind of not what this
feels like
but Charlie and I are decorating the
house today
we've just got all our Christmas things
down from the loft might be able to see
boxes
Charlie's making a Christmas playlist
yes we've got quite a lot of stuff to
rummage through we've been collecting
Christmas things for about four years
now there's a fourth Christmas in this
house so I've got quite a nice selection
of them bits and bobs which we've
collected Dexter is there really nothing
drinking the Christmas tree water so I
think we're gonna have to create like a
blockage or something I think I'm
probably gonna be getting a little bit
of help from Dexter hey Dex
what you wearing little boys sugar me
and you arraigned here
so put the lights on the tree is looking
rather good if you take say myself and
now we're gonna put the bull balls on
this I just got all our bull balls
actually Charlie has just got all our
bull balls out from the boxes and got
some really cute ones let me show you so
we have a few from previous years we got
these from Bruce Lee in the sale last
year after Christmas I think that might
be a pretty one as well it's really
pretty
we've got these ones which are actually
from rituals and they are scented tree
things so we have this oil
yeah tassels this one so you have this
oil which we drip over them and then it
just makes the room smell lovely and
Charlie got me this sausage dog for my
birthday which is quite a good little
match for Dexter wherever he is not sure
a little beasty and then we have a few
from this brand Gisella grain which I
absolutely love got this from a garden
centers little sparkly reindeer
some sparkly acorns and pinecones this
is also Gisela Graham I got it from
accessorize this is probably my favorite
absolutely love this little guy pinecone
these are from Amsterdam Charlie and I
got them on a recent trip we've got this
nice little present this sparkly
reindeer which is from Claire's
accessories and then we've got star it's
a little copper lights which are from
Primark it's been out quite a nice
little selection
tree is looking good
Charlie's making sure it's all
symmetrical got Jamie honor gone in the
background tired dog nice reindeer I
have just been putting mistletoe in
strategic places there's one on the door
no I have standard chair to show you
that oh god it will mistletoe up for the
door so when people come in they have to
have a cheeky little man next we need to
put the star on the tree or do we wait
until all the decorations are done so I
think we will do
maybe the banister on the stairs we have
a really cute little long thing which
you put on there and I also got from a
garden center a little thing for a
fireplace so ever I find first will be
what we do next so I found this which is
the one for the fireplace look at my
little baby I'm gonna put this this all
stuck together which is quite nice
little forest festive bundle so let's
take all of these down and back up
afterwards
no happy dog no no Dexter and I just
wanted to tell you about today's
giveaway prize taking a break from the
Christmas decorations and it's this
lovely little bundle here which I'll
show you now so today I'm giving away a
fragrance from bronley and these are the
coolest packaging fragrances ever really
really cool so you've got the Crimson
McLeod fragrance here which Dexter is a
big fan of no no cheeky monkey your box
might have a few bite marks on it
naughty boy
also I have a little cosmetic set from
me me me this is the ultimate eye
palette so you've got lots of lovely
colors in there I can't open it to show
you because it's sealed and then a few
of their little
shadow trios as well so nice sparkly
ones no for the festive party season and
the main prize is this which is a Zulu
see peel off gel starter set so
everything you need to create gel nails
but unlike normal gel nails whether an
absolute hassle to take off these ones
are peel off so really really cool nail
set
so that's your lovely prizes for today
I'm gonna do this one on Twitter again
they seem to be the easiest so I'm going
to leave a tweet down below and all
you're going to do is retweet it so
we're pretty much done with the
Christmas decorations let me just turn
the TV on mute because of some weird war
of the world kind of film going on there
mute there we go let me show you what
we've done with our decorations I'll
start out in the hallway so I've covered
our radiator cover in this very sparkly
kind of don't know what you'd call it
Garland it's like sparkly pinecones and
little red festive things will covered
in gold picked up so that's on our
radiator cover as you come into our
hallway so this is a boy here the doors
are just that and then you can see
behind me up there on the stairs we have
got
give time with your brain I'll show you
down if I can allow another strength up
there as well shut out the hearing noise
and then in here this is our lounge so
this is pretty much the most festive
room you can see done you can see in the
window behind me there's like a little
sparkly thing going on and tent so move
above the curtain rails and over here in
this corner we've got a little light-up
polar bear which is really really cute
this table just got a little amaryllis
which is cute
then our fireplace area we've got some
kind of Christmasy diffusers this is the
one from next I was talking about smells
like Gemini and pomegranate noir a
Christmas card from Joey Malone looks
like that townhouse and yeah some little
festive candles then I got these from a
local garden center and they are amazing
we used to spend ages with like blue
tack and sellotape getting the stockings
to hang on the fireplace but these were
2 for 11 pounds quite pricey but they do
the job and obviously going to last
forever so we've got these two stockings
which were from Marks and Spencers last
year and I've just kind of stuffed them
with a few empty boxes and down here in
the actual fireplace I've just put this
Primark wreath and Dexter stocking it's
really crap lighting but that's Dexter
stocking there he's got some little
bones in it already
he hasn't smelled it yeah I'm sure he
won he does he'll want to shred it a few
Christmas candles and then you can see
here's our Christmas tree I've got these
light up presents which I got from a
local garden center some real presence
and then our tree I think this is my
favorite tree that we've ever had it's
so beautiful it's actually ginormous
it's probably maybe seven foot
definitely more than six foot and the
aren't what you call the decorations are
just so lovely as I said we've kind of
built up over the years and have loads
of really personal ones now they're
moving around we have got a little first
corner here tea light holder with a
reindeer these light up candles from
next but snowflakes along there they
were from garden centers while I think
and then I've just put some nice candles
like festive ones on our bookcase and
then this if you can see this here
little like reindeer wooden silhouette
item was a gift from Charlie's mom my
birthday so yeah I think that looks very
cute so I'll to show you from far away
what it all looks like a typical TV
let's just block that out cuz it doesn't
look very festive yeah isn't that
adorable hey Charlie has finished
shipping else I can show you up into the
corridor so behind me on the stairs you
will see our little garland going to the
stairs which is rather cute so it has it
was different from like one of those you
know pop-up christmas shops that come up
on the high street they fill up all the
empty shops that so we bought this from
and then I stuck Christmas decorations
on it so got loads of baubles I got some
kind of wired ribbon which have made a
little bow and then I've stuck some
Holly in fake Holly this you might
recognize from some of my blog photos
got it from a garden center so put the
balls in there and the same with this so
yeah just quite a cute way of decorating
our stairs
so Charlie and I have just had a nice
lazy Sunday dinner we just got one of
those nice pops my crate not my
criticals
you know please give me a blood meal
things
wait Jose and now festive Sunday chilled
evening watching Bruce Almighty I'm just
