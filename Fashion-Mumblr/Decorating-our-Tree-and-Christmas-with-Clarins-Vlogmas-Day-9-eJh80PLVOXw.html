vlogmas day 809 not sure losing track
but you guys didn't get a vlogmas
yesterday because I posted my Christmas
gift ride for her so I really hope you
enjoyed it in case you can't tell by the
current makeup and outfit setup I've
literally just filmed the head Grisons
gift guide so a bit of a quick
turnaround but yes I didn't vlog
yesterday but it was a really fun day
but quite a busy day so I probably
wouldn't be now to daily vlog anyway but
I went for lunch with Clinique and my
friend Gemma from this London life at
the forest on the roof restaurant at
Selfridges and it's so beautiful and
festive up there it's absolutely
gorgeous and we shared a fondue for
starters and actually it was the most
tasty fondue I think I've ever had
despite all the fondues that we had in
Switzerland I think that one was better
it had so much garlic in it um I'm
actually done in the cheesehead garlic
him but it was with garlic bread but
whatever it was amazing and then I had
like chickens and then we had a sweet
know and then and then I had a sticky
toffee pudding for dessert and father
Christmas was there so it's just a
really amazing lunch and then I had a
few more meetings and then it was the
magical Clarence Christmas dinner event
and parents always put on the most
fabulous Christmas events this time it
was the berry Brothers wine merchant
there was like the venue for it and the
evening started with some wine tasting
so we tried a few of the French wines
that they sell in very brothers and they
were just up to scrumptious we got to
take home two bottles of wine of our
choice and champagne so incredibly
generous and we had a fabulous
three-course festive meal down in the
wine cellars and the table was so
stunning just the most beautiful table
decorations I think it was
McQueen's Flores that did the
decorations they were beautiful and also
got to take down some Clarence crackers
that was just the most magical way to
spend the evening so if you're watching
girls thank you so much for putting on
once again the most beautiful Christmas
party and then today is a busy working
from home day I'm going to try and film
some videos and
some blog photos take some vlog photos
edit some blog posts catch from my
emails but right now I'm heading to the
hair salon because I need to do some
photos with my hair in braids and I'm
not very good at doing my own hair so um
I'm going to live true which used to be
grow which is where I usually got my
hair colored so I'm having now they're
gonna plant my hair for me and also
getting a pouch test because I'm getting
my hair cut during a few days time so um
let's get going
so just tonight the lip shoe salon on
half of North and I've had my hair done
looking absolutely beautiful exactly
what I wanted I took in a pinch at photo
and yeah absolutely perfect so ready for
a day of filming and photo taking and
then Charlie now going out for dinner so
it's a really good way of getting your
hair done without having to worry about
doing it yourself if like me you are
pretty rubbish add your own hairstyles
so Charlie and I are now going to go and
get our Christmas tree because the
clouds go down the road and selling
Christmas trees and then we're going to
take this morning Charlie is the one as
I oh we don't need a roughage we don't
need it delivered so you're gonna regret
that even it slowly going cause at some
point
let me get my end
just got back home and we've left the
tree outside because we're just gonna
film a video before we get stuck into
decorating we're gonna film the his and
hers Christmas gift guide I've just made
myself a coffee I've got this gorgeous
sausage dog mug but actually weirdly I
don't know who sent it because Charlie
opened up my blogger mail in doddle and
the note disappeared so I'm really sad
that I don't know where it came from
because I absolutely love it do you like
it do you miss the sausage Dexter likes
it too this one new roomie and yeah it's
just opening up a little bit of blogger
mail and Elizabeth Arden have sent me a
gingerbread cookie that says oh that
says hohoho on its I'm gonna enjoy that
with my coffee as well as their classic
8 hour cream which is just the best
multitasking product ever as well as a
Pandora necklace so very generous gifts
from Pandora but yeah I'm just really
sad that I don't know where this has
come from so if it was any of you guys

done I can't actually remember the last
time I picked up a vlogging camera today

6:00 now and I've just ordered a

right this smells amazing oh my gosh oh
my god I'll have to calm down
oh so our favorite honest burger had
switched oh my god I switched off their
delivery so we were forced to get
something a bit different but I think
it's paid off we've gone for first the
burgers fries mikowski Helen was just
good and not quite as good
Bukowski for the burgers and then
macaroni and cheese apparently there's
somewhere near here that specializes in
mac and cheese don't know how I'm not

barely stop myself from dribbling you've
got camembert mac and cheese and then

gonna start decorating the tree but
first I have to show you something why
don't you like dressing up as Santa my
little Roo chin chin why don't you like
being father Christmas
listen it's actually triggers haha
so we have unwrapped all of our
Christmas baubles and charleen I don't
really go for a colored thief Christmas
we just keep collecting bubbles that we
love and that means something to us so
for example we've got some ones that we
picked up on our trip to answer which I
hadn't painted this year at the quadrant
arcade on Regent Street and it just says
2016 on it yeah this will always remind
us of our first year in this house
because we just bought loads of really
cheap decorations from Paper Chase
including this style so we'll always
keep hold of that one where's the one
bus and then like this was my first year
of beauty vlogging it's an origins
although so that will just always remind
me of my first year of belonging and
then this year we've got some really
nice positions as well this one is from
Anthropologie you might have seen it in
my Christmas decoration in the whole
video and last year we bought some
really nice ones as well so this one is
one of my favorites from last year it's
a little owl I think it was just
allogram is that the name of the brand
name Gisela Graham is like
online or maybe like Selfridges or
nothing while the nice things if you go
