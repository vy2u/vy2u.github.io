channel today's video is going to be
part two of my January sales haul and
I'm going to be showing you the pieces
that I picked up at a slightly more
premium that's premium high street and
designer pieces that I bought during the
Boxing Day and January sales the sales
are still going on especially within
these slightly high-priced retailers so
as I did in part one of this video I
will leave everything linked down below
so in case you want to show up any of
these pieces any of these bargains then
hopefully that'll make it a little bit
easier for you if you did miss part one
then I'll leave that link down below as
well that was my slightly more
affordable haul so from the likes of a
sauce Top Shop Quique Bowden Jack Wills
all those kind of high street retailers
I'll leave that video link down below
for you to have a watch after this one
but for today I'm going to show you
those slightly higher priced items that
I got in the January sales I picked up
some really lovely classic pieces so for
me when I do spend a little bit more I
want to ensure that I get real wear out
of the pieces and I don't really like to
buy high-end pieces that are really
trendy I prefer them to be classics so
when classic items go in the sale I
definitely think it's worth splurging a
little bit more on those pieces so that
further ado I'm going to get started
with net-a-porter because that is the
nearest box I did actually do two
net-a-porter purchases and because they
just kept adding more things into the
sale so a no particular order here are a
few pieces that I got starting with some
swimwear so you may recognize this if
you follow me on Instagram over the
summer it's a brand called Marysia I
think that's how it's pronounced and I
basically discovered this this summer
and found everything that I purchased
from them in the full price and time of
year I absolutely loved them and I felt
it was so worth spending that little bit
extra on the swimwear because it really
added to my beach confidence I never had
really felt that confident in a bikini
before trying this band but I really
loved how they looked so when I saw that
the brand had got into sale I picked up
a few pieces starting with this one
piece I just absolutely adore this
pattern I think it's really effective in
photos and tragic that that was on my
first thoughts but it really does come
across beautifully on
photographs and as it's a one-piece I
thought for those days and I'm really
not feeling like getting my body out too
much but I am in a lovely location this
will work absolutely wonderfully it's
strapless so you still get a flawless
tan across the chest and it's also
fairly backless too there's quite a
large expanse of revealed skin on the
back so you can still get a nice back
tan and if you prefer you can actually
add the straps they are there but
they're removable so if you're doing
some swimming and you want to have the
straps on then that is an option too I
bought another swimsuit this one is a
slightly different design I'm probably
only going to keep one so let me know in
the comments below which one is your
favorite this one is a halter neck as
you can see here and this one also has a
scalloped detail so I absolutely adore
this scalloped detail if somebody said
you loved it and it's again very
revealing on the back big open back but
full coverage on the tummy area so
really good for those slightly more body
conscious moments so I'm going to try
both of those on let me know which one
that you guys prefer and then I picked
up another swimsuit from a brand that I
discovered through Instagram and it is
Zimmerman this is actually a bikini so
its mix and match I chose these bottoms
and this top both of which I feel like
the styling is a little bit antiquey and
but I felt that this one would be really
good in those days and I want to turn
that still look fashionable
so this is a blush pink top the pattern
is kind of some old vintage e leaves and
then the bottom has the same leaf print
and I really like this ladder detail
that goes across the top so it's going
to just be really really effective the
bottom is not too big so it's not going
to be really big and baggy on the bum I
probably would not have paid full price
Rosamond bikini because they are quite
pricey but when I spotted this in the
sale I thought it'd be a good time to
try the brand a few pieces from self
portrait also went down in the
net-a-porter sale and I thought I was
really lucky to find this top it's quite
a classic style I tried this on the
other day I absolutely loved it it's got
a high neckline and this lace detail
just looks like a really beautiful
collared detail it's really effective
and then the crocheted tie place goes
down onto the sleeves too
then you've got almost it's kind of like
a princess neckline the way that the
fabric is sheer at the top and then more
covering down at the bottom this will
look absolutely gorgeous with skirts
with jeans as well read jazz up a jean
outfit and I feel like it's a really
good balance between casual and smart
and dressed up as well so I think I'll
get a lot of use out of something like
this the material is really beautiful
quality as you'd expect from
self-portrait this is actually the first
top that I've bought from self portrait
the only other things that I've earned
from them before have been dresses which
I'm sure you guys have seen so much
across various YouTube channels and
Instagram accounts but I thought I
really wanted to try something different
from the brand so I'm really looking
forward to giving this top a lot of wear
so as everything in the first box that
was my first net approach sale purchase
and now let's go into the second box so
I decided to pick up something else from
Zimmerman these looked absolutely
beautiful
on the model I hope they won't hope it
just is nice on me but they look like a
really beautiful beach attire piece and
I'm hoping that this year I'm going to
get to go on a few more actual holidays
as opposed to work trips which means
that hopefully I'll get to wear these a
lot they've got pom-pom details down at
the bottom and I always feel like hem
details are really effective and the
ladder detail that I mentioned on the
bikini is also present on these shorts
they seem to look really nice and fitted
narrow on the waist so hopefully should
be quite flattering and then they have a
bit of a flare bit of a kick out on the
short and I find that white shorts look
great either with a blouse or perhaps
you've got a swimsuit and you want to go
for lunch but you don't want to put on a
full outfit just these over top your
swimming costume will look really really
beautiful once again I got these for a
good price in the sale probably wouldn't
of paid full price links they're quite
expensive but for something that I'm
going to wear on so many upcoming
holidays I thought they were a really
good buy and then the last thing in this
box is a pair of boots so this is a pair
of Chloe boots and I had actually had my
irony's for quite some time so when I
saw them going down
for sale I thought it would be a good
time to treat myself so inside the box
you do get a dust bag a big Chloe dust
bag and then so this is actually the
first time that I've seen the boots as
well so it's an unboxing as much as it
is a sale haul here they are as you can
see a really beautiful classic timeless
design in this gorgeous tan colored
leather you've got a lighter tan
elasticated section and a wooden heel
totally timeless totally classic these
kind of boots are never going to go out
of style
that's why are you really surprised to
see them in the sale you don't normally
see such classic pieces going down in
price so I snapped these up the price
that I pay for these is only a little
bit more than what you'd expect to pay
in the premium end of the high street in
shops like Reese shops like All Saints
and even some Kurt Geiger shoes so I was
so so surprised to see these going down
the sale at such a good price I feel
like because the style is totally
timeless it was definitely worth
spending just a teeny teeny bit more and
I just know I can tell from the quality
of these they're going to be really long
lasting so I'm sure I'm going to be
getting a lot of use out of these price
per wear of things like this is always
really good so I don't mind investing
just a little bit more in such timeless
pieces so really pleased with those and
speaking of Footwear the next retailer
that I went to in the sales is Tory
Burch I picked up a few pairs of shoes
from Tory Burch also pairs I'd had my
eye on for quite some time once again
this is the first time I'm opening this
up so a bit of an unboxing for you guys
inside the box there is this tissue
paper you've got a little compliment
slip variations in the color blah blah
blah blah so let's see
okay so they've only managed to fit one
pair of boots in this box these forms I
could not believe how discounted fees
were I had my own of quite some time as
like ski snow boots I'm hopefully going
to be going skiing at some point this
season nothing but yet but fingers
crossed these will also be great if we
get any really icy days here in the UK
any snowy days because they've got such
a grippy sole I thought they just looked
so stylish with this almost shearling
detail this is like a suede fabric and
then you've got this big furry and not
real for a turndown section at the top
so really beautiful timeless design once
again really good quality this is what I
mean when I say I love to buy timeless
pieces in the sale when I see things
that aren't going to be going in and out
of style in the sale that's when I can
really justify that slightly higher
spend and this is that exact kind of
thing I can imagine myself wearing these
in five 10 years going to rugby games
walking in the snow going on ski trips
these are just going to be in style
forever basically so really really
lovely timeless purchase from a Tory
Burch and in my second Tory Burch box I
think this is another pair of shoes
once again they come with a dust bag and
these ones I actually considered sending
for from the US but now Tory Burch has
the UK site so it makes it a lot easier
once again another pair of classic
winter boots these are in this beautiful
light tan color really really light tan
so a little bit different to most of my
kind of outdoor shoes which are all
either black or dark brown these ones I
felt were a lot more feminine and
ladylike and a lot more mean to be
honest I think these will look really
nice with lighter colored trousers
I've got a few Pastore jeans Sophie how
many I see days in the spring time with
white jeans as well and then once again
they've got this faux fur around the top
which really just finishes them off
along with this gold buckle they've got
a zip opening and closing section here
as I hopefully
a lot easier to slide on and off than a
few of my other pairs of boots once
again I'll be leaving all the prices
what they were full price and what I pay
for them just here so you can see what's
the bargain I got with those I feel like
for me tory burch is a brand that i've
always aspired to but i don't usually
buy that much from them but i think it
was just an instagram post that i saw or
maybe even a facebook group that really
inspired me to check out their sale and
I was so so pleased to see these two
pairs of boots going down in the sale as
I said I had had my eye on them for
quite some time and the fact that you
can get them delivered for free in the
UK the fact that it's now a UK warehouse
just makes it so much easier so you're
probably going to see a little bit more
from Tory Burch here on my channel I
just really love the brand whenever I go
to America I always browse in the shops
and pick up a few bits and bobs so
really great they're now much more easy
to get your hands on here in the UK and
then this is the final piece that I got
from a Tory Burch it is just tiny little
wallet I actually picked this up as a
potential gift for someone I don't
actually know who yet but this was such
a good price and I thought such a really
useful little item when you open it up
and it's got the coin section and then
some card sections too so yeah as I said
it's going to be a gift for someone I'm
not sure who yet but I just know so many
of my friends that absolutely love this
so any birthday's coming up then
potentially this would be a really
lovely gift idea last but not least I
also shopped in the Rhys sale so many of
my favourite premium high street stores
had incredible sales this year loads of
things I have been loving throughout the
past few months went down in sale
including this top this one is actually
Karen Millen this one went down from
around 100 pounds 260 pounds and I'm
pretty sure it's mostly sold out now but
I will leave a link to down below just
in case so me my favorite Rhys jackets
she lays they went down so well in the
sale and I hope that you guys followed
me on Twitter I was tweeting links like
crazy so hopefully managed to pick up a
few bargains but for myself I picked up
this absolutely gorgeous blush pink faux
fur juillet in the sale I've been really
loving G lace on
it's a little bit more mild maybe you
don't want the claustrophobia of a full
coat but you still want that added
warmth that's what I absolutely love is
you lace and it means you can see on
knitwear whatever you're wearing
underneath a little bit more clearly but
to be honest is the color of this that I
absolutely fell in love with it's my
absolute favorite color this beautiful
blush pink you've also got this
beautiful silky lining a chain hanging
detail it's design details like that
that I absolutely love from these
premium high street retailers like Reese
so this I've actually already worn so
many times and I feel like in spring
especially this will be a really lovely
piece when you do want to have a bit
more light color in your wardrobe and as
I said the temperatures a little bit
more mild I can see myself wearing this
and not only this spring but also many
more seasons to come so that's
everything that I picked up in the
January sales you guys have now seen my
high street haul and my premium and
designer haul as well so as I mentioned
at the beginning really pleased with the
classicness of these items I feel that
nothing is a whimsical purchase or
something that's not going to be in
fashion in a few years time all of these
pieces because they are a little bit
more luxurious will last meet so long so
I don't regret any of these purchases
really really pleased to everything that
I found in the sale as I mentioned I'll
leave the links down below in case you
want to shop them as well so thank you
guys so much for watching I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did

thumbs up and subscribe if you're new to
