Toba part 8 today's vlog is gonna be
quite a chilled one as you might go to
tell from wet hair and slobbing clothes
today i'm working from home which is
quite a nice change from yesterday
because I was out on a boat all day
so the gleen party which you will know
if you watched last vlog and by the way
I don't wear loads of eyeliner at home
this is just the remnants of the makeup
last night hopefully you guys will have
seen my makeup last night I got it done
with illamasqua which was amazing I
would never be able to do anything like
that myself and and as soon as I got
home I did scrub it loads I used all the
mice in the water I went through about
20 different cotton pads and then I did
Lynn's Liz Earle cleanse and polish and
I double cleanse through the shower this
morning as well and I still can't get
the fine liner off because she really
wedged into my lashes so that's why I
look like I'm wearing I don't know when
actually I've just got a little bit of
mascara on anyway enough of that
umm it's half 11 yeah it's off 11 at the
moment and I'm cooking macaroni cheese I
absolutely love my cream cheese and
personally I think that my recipe is
unbeatable the best recipe in the world
but I saw on one delusive snapchat about
two weeks ago that she had this which is
the anime animes I've never heard of an
amazing fall but padding they do a
really amazing mac and cheese pop-up
which I can't believe no one told me
about because that's like me all over
and yeah so this one looses snapchat and
I tweeted her being like I need that in
my life and they really kindly sent me
one and I'm so excited and so grateful
so thank you so much for this so today
I'm gonna change my usual mac and cheese
tactics and I'm going to use the anime
classic mac and cheese recipe I didn't
go out and buy any particular
ingredients for this so I'm just gonna
be using and
I have in my kitchen which is actually
my normal ingredients so butter and it's
a little bit of parmesan and actually I
usually use Cathedral City but this was
on offer I don't know what Brandis maybe
the brand is too strong so I may be
using my usual ingredients but the anime
recipe tactics what's the word method
yeah so we'll see if there's any
different to my usual one and I'm gonna
put sentries order in a minute and order
some of the ingredients for which the
recipe book recommends so in this book
it says midget or cheddar which is what
I have Monterey Jack which I don't have
but I think that's the orange one that's
quite strong quite powerful so I'm sure
that I make even better parmesan which I
do have English mustard which I don't
usually use but um uh-huh
so we have some English mustard so I'll
stick some of that in as well absolutely
love mustard so that probably very good
one and it also says mozzarella by don't
have any mozzarella so we're gonna have
to go without that
oh yeah it's amazing the mustard
absolutely makes that amazing I never
would have thought to add mustard in
there before it's so good
well I can safely say that that was
probably one of the best macaroni
cheese's I've ever made myself I think
had I got the milk situation right and
made it look like more milk it would
have been the best but because it was
just a little bit thick my fault not
anime is fault
it would have been the best because that
mustard Edition was amazing oh hello so
now um I'm in a bit of a food coma not
gonna lie I need to crack on with some
emails I'm going to come back just a
little man
you'll come with money yes my phone yes
and we're gonna go upstairs and work on
some emails
so we gave Dexter some warning paste
this little pure angel baby yes
oh okay so I've done about an hour and a
half of emails so I feel like I've been
quite productive which is good and now
before the light goes it hasn't already
gone because is half past two I really
need to film a video so I thought we
could do a little get ready with me get
ready for me filming makeup and
everything so loosely and this isn't
gonna work so this you probably will
recognize as my filming room and then
over here in this little chest of
drawers are just really really messy in
the moment this is where I keep my
makeup so let's have a look these two
foundations are both really good for
filming I like the NARS and also the
Rimmel match perfection I think I'm
gonna go with the Rimmel today just cuz
it's kind of a status bet oh you know
I'm sorry I've been Connie up and down
the stairs of Dexter and then some
bronzer I'm using Estee Lauder bronze
goddess I'm gonna need some powder you
need my lash curlers what else use my
stealer I shadow palette which out City
love you guys saw I think it was my
September favorites you'll have seen
this but look at all these colors so
pretty
I think I might do hmm
this one and this one today so yeah I'm
gonna stick on some makeup and I'll show
you how I prepare this room currently
got my wedding dress on it from the
party ready why did you what have you
found it oh boy
he found mummys veil from last night's
party did you think it'd be fun to shred
it did
so we've done the bass I've gone quite
light on the under eye area because
didn't get a huge amount of sleep last
night so I've had to put quite a lot
under-eye concealer on and so I used I
ended up using real match perfection and
then my NARS creamy concealer because my
skin is quite dry at the moment I find
this as one of them more god I still
have set bags I find this is one of the
more moisturizing of my under-eye
concealers now are you shredding Dexter
no no so the eyes are done there's
nothing I can do about these bags
they're not going away anywhere but
don't I can shut it why so now I'm gonna
choose a lipstick I have been loving at
these tomforde ones since I tried
personally this is a lovely autumnal
color and it's called deep mink you
can't see that can you some thing I'm
gonna put some of this on add some
contouring some bronzer ready to go
okay so makeup is finally done I don't
think I'm gonna do too much with my hair
just cuz I'm really worried that the
light is going so I'm just gonna try and
roll with it
so now I need to get the room ready so I
fill in this little tripod so make sure
I got the lens flipped out and then I'm
just made like a little tunnel setup
around here we've got my little white
pumpkin which I got from Sainsbury's and
then some nice long tunnel colored
flowers also think from Sainsbury's my
home base lamp and my up and lights
lights which I've switched on not even
light a candle make it super autumnal I
think I'm even gonna just do it in this
jungle because I want you quite a
chilled video so tell me
okay filming is done and now I have to
deal with the aftermath which is not fun
and I'm not going to vlog it's not gonna
do any speed motion or anything because
I just need to hurry now time has
completely got away with me it's four
o'clock I was planning on editing a vlog
publishing a vlog going to dawdle to get
my post and then catching a five o'clock
train all of those things take an hour
so that's not gonna happen so I need to
hurry I'm not going to go to dawdle and
I'm pretty not gonna add in my vlog
which is annoying I wanted to get it out
today and yeah I'll see you and I've
tidied up and look what this little boy
has been doing while mummy's been
tidying up was that you not mummys
knickers no naughty boy you are a baddie
okay so the vlog for today is just not
going to happen because it's half-past
four which means I need to leave to go
and get the Train that's going to mom's
house tonight and so I packed my little
bag so I've been doing for the past half
an hour and tied my hair back because
that's like Russia is better than a fro
I've got my Topshop jump on the who
jeans and yeah so heading out now going
to crap a jontron to get the trains go
meet mum such lights off grab the
rubbish where's the dog
finally made it to mum's house after a
rather long train journey cuz chai and I
missed one of our trains I put my nice
Snuggie SuperDrive headband on and now
we're heading out to watch the fireworks
leaving the dogs all here at the old
friend is now so we can use them good
morning it is Saturday morning and I'm
just waiting for mum to come out the
house because we're going to watch a
Charlie play rugby which is in Guildford
this morning it's not his old school
where it normally is
Dexter's here earlier and as debating
words with its harness on or his hoodie
it's a little bit chilly if I'm gonna go
with the harness because I'm gonna have
to keep him on the lead and also excited
me for little Dexter and for me I am
gonna see our friends Sophie and Matt
and their gorgeous new puppy Bella who's
actually I think only two days older
than Dexter they've probably had her
they heard about seeing that time that
I've had Dexter I haven't met her yet so
we are so excited to meet
hey guys so I have been a really bad
vlogger this afternoon didn't really
pick up the camera
since the rugby game but the rugby was
good the oh jeez one as they normally do
which was great and I just done my
makeup I'm ready for dinner we're going
out with then I'm going out with the
dinner we're going on tonight with some
friends Beth and Andy haven't seen in
quite a long time so do my makeup but
they're gonna be here any second now
decide what to wear so yeah I just
thought I'd catch up with you guys
because hasn't spoken in so long but um
yes
talk to you in a second when I decided
what to wax and why they're gonna arrive
any second good morning it is Sunday
morning and Charlie and I are just
taking the extra little walk on Clapham
Common because it's really beautiful
today it's quite it's quite cool but
it's real nice and sunny as you can see
so Dex has got this little hoodie on
you're looking absolutely adorable and
just take him out for a little walk just
done some outfit photos I'm doing some
like autumnal style goofy background
outfit photos it's just fun um didn't
really end the vlog properly last night
but we went to this place called
boqueria down the road from us for tapas
with our friends back and Andy which was
lovely and then a few drinks and quite
chilled evening which was nice
he is getting much better on the lead
but he's still not really sure about it
so every now and then he cries for us to
pick him up which we do because we loved
him where is he where are y'all man oh
yeah back from our walk with Dexter now
my challenge is to sort out my blog mail
just went down to dobble before we took
Dexter for a walk so I have loads of
things to unwrap so this is my choice of
hot chocolate so this evening is the
hotel Jacques la them salted caramel
drinking chocolate see I meant to add
milk to a saucepan and heat it up and
then add the chocolate in but I can
never know whether to do that so I'm
just gonna put some milk in my mug heat
it in the microwave and then add some of
this which is just chocolate sprinkles
so it melts really really easily and
while I'm waiting for the milk to heat
up I usually have a few mouthfuls of
this as well
so seeing as the weather was so nice I
thought will be a good opportunity to do
a make a video so I've just filmed this
makeup look well though I have wiped off
half the lipstick because I'm just gonna
have some lunch now I'm having a lunch
at my desk today so much to do for the
background it's pretty weird so yeah I'm
having peace you're wondering this is
like a chicken and super-green soup and
tiger bread french baguette tiger bread
I absolutely love it so much and I'm
gonna eat it my desk cuz I got so much
work to do so I'm gonna have some lunch
and I'll see you later
so lunch is done it is eaten and oh my
god I just love his smell so much like
if he got a puppy then you just know
that they've got such a gorgeous smell
some days I just find him
more irresistible than others and today
is one of those days but if I did that I
wouldn't get any work done and I've got
a load so I need to do so first thing
I'm gonna do now is I need to take the
like close-up shots from when I did my
video so I got my camera set up here but
the memory card is in there so I'll see
you after I've done the close-up shots
okay so mass filming sesh done I really
need to buy two memory cards so they
could have logged filming I showed you
have two memory cards are definitely
lost one and I know I said it earlier
but dextrous is being so cute today like
he's just been snuggled up on the bed
helping me film you know so yeah I just
filmed my October favorites and this
makeup look and a review on the steam
pod contraption which is really good so
definitely go and check it out my review
of that when it's live cuz I highly
highly recommend it
and it's what I've been using over a
normal straightener recently and the
hair it's nice and glossy which it never
normally is so yeah I'm gonna go and
take over let's make it off and tidy up
the bonsai
it crackled with some emails oh I said I
was gonna sit down and do emails but
actually I realized that I still had to
film parts of my wood tunnel deck or
videos so I just filmed that and now it
is pitch black outside nearly and it's
only five o'clock and I feel like it's
nine o'clock but I'm now gonna crack on
with some emails as I said I was gonna
do it about two hours ago
and I need to edit this vlog to go live
tomorrow so thank you guys for watching
