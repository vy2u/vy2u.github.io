when you guys are watching this it's
gonna be Christmas Eve which means it's
Christmas tomorrow so excited I don't
feel that festive because it's now
actually decided to a sunny outside
which is um pretty amazing gosh how
British just start a vlog and talk about
the weather
how boring um as you might guess I'm
having at the panthan morning I've just
put on a shun Takei face mask and it
feels really lovely it's quite a smooth
matte mask and I'm gonna use a lush bath
bomb that glittery star and some German
own bath oil and I had to pull off all
my no I had to pull off all of those
Christmas Santa nails because they were
annoying me so much and I just couldn't
get anything done so I pulled them all
off and I'm going to give myself the
Christmas manicure maybe give myself a
gel manicure when I'm at the bath so
that should be fun I've just put live my
festive lookbook video which is
definitely my favorite video I've ever
done it was when I was with Jay at the
Great Foster's Hotel and just absolutely
loved it so make sure you go and check
that out if you haven't I'm really
really proud of it and yeah let's go and
have a little look at that I did just
run myself a hot bath and well that was
the intention but I went to get in it
and it was freezing cold so I've just
reset the boiler and I'm hoping that it
might sort itself out before I need to
get in the bath
so after my lovely pamper session I
think I'm going to give somebody else a
little pre-christmas pamper now Dexter
has never had his teeth brushed or had a
proper bath before he's been in the
shower with me a few times but never his
own little bath
so um yeah I thought I would share this
with you because how I'm feeling if
somebody is not gonna like me very much
after this you more users each young man
no mommy so I have got this dog mad
dirty dog shampoo natural cleansing
shampoo I think it's nice it is natural
and it says it's lavender and peppermint
essential oils so that sounds nice it
sounds a little bit girly but I'm sure
Dexter won't mind and then let's put the
toilet down I've got this toothpaste for
fresh breath because he has been a bit
stinky recently and apparently it's
liver flavored which sounds delightful
and then we've got this contraption here
which is like a double-ended toothbrush
so might have a go at the smaller end
let's see how I get on now I don't have
to touch push our unit so might just
make a shallow bath and get a mug or
something just wash over him
why I'm just not sure about the water
yet but I think I'll get used to it
come on little man let's get the dogs in
the bus good boy good boy good boy nice
way that your boy
put the camera oh no no no no no it's
okay stay stay in the bar
are you ready get him yes yeah I am
yes you are you can apply you had to pee
my little boy is very brave on you you
are a good boy and let me she's gonna
tell dry you mmm boy big boy big boy oh
so soft
huh
sit sit sit
I'm so sorry daddy
so it's fair to say that was a little
bit trickier than I was bargaining for
and Dexter definitely does not like
having his teeth brush I have to have to
try and find a new way of doing that
because yeah he has got rather smelly
breath recently but not a fan of the
toothbrush but he did do quite well in
the bath and now he smells lovely of
peppermint so yeah at least we did one
thing now I need to photograph basically
I'm doing a humungous giveaway on the
day after boxing days for the 27th
alongside a survey to find out a little
bit more about you guys and whether you
read the blog or just watch YouTube but
basically the prizes are absolutely
amazing let me show you some of them now
I've got a watch from ice London I've
got a Braun satin hair like electric
hairbrush bareMinerals candlelight glow
set yeah Lucy peel off gel manicure set
and loads more you can see like all the
different prizes in here so now I'm
going to set this up and take a photo
and hopefully get the blog post
scheduled so I don't need to worry about
anything until the 27th because yeah
I'll be rather dreamy if I don't have to
worry about anything and I really don't
have been working over Christmas so I'm
pretty rubbish at picking up the camera
today it's 5 o'clock now and I've pretty
much just been trying to schedule some
blog posts and videos and I am
thankfully all done now in time for
Christmas so no more laptop time apart
from editing this vlog and editing that
tomorrow's vlog so yeah little bit more
laptop time and but yeah 5 o'clock now
and I've just got back from dawdle and
have quite a lot of bloggers mail so I
thought the thing is I haven't really
done much in today's vlog that we would
open it together and see what's inside
but first I need a lip balm because my
lips are killing me think I'm gonna put
on my Clarins
moisture punishing Lathon so this this
box was actually delivered to the house
earlier and it's a brand called mon
showroom which i actually met at the
apartment during London Fashion Week and
they really kindly sent over a discount
code so
I picked up this bowl from that I just
saw it's nice kind of summery salad bowl
or fruit bowl and I don't really have
anything like that but I really like the
style so got the bowl and also this
lovely swimming costume I'm really
hoping to get a winter Sun holiday as I
mentioned and just sort of like a cosy
because we all know that I'm not gonna
go into gym anytime soon I've failed the
past few days so cozy is a nice shout
and then for when I get a tan I also got
this pair of bikini bottoms and I really
like the back of them because they're
not too big like I like to get a bit of
tan on my mom and yeah they've got that
ruching detail which is quite flattering
if you've them if I'm not too worried
about getting your bum out a little bit
on the beach so this is a brand called
vole cotton and this is a brand called
cling and both of them were from mom
that showroom so it was a nice little
hole inside this one from Tommy Hilfiger
which is incredibly generous and very
exciting was this very classical got
some fluff on it very classic and
beautiful kind of pea green trench coat
and I don't really have like a classic
coat this almost reminds me of like
wartime evacuate but it's just such
beautiful quality you've got like
colorful silk on the inside and it's
lovely thick warm material hopefully
it's not gonna be too big of a boxy on
me because it does look quite large but
I will give that a try when I finished
unwrapping things so thank you Tommy
Hilfiger very very generous Oh My lordy
I haven't actually got a carrier bag
absolutely full of nail varnishes
basically Rimmel kindly said that they
provide some nail varnishes for my
giveaway which is launching on the 27th
so check the blog on and 27th that it's
a ginormous survey that I'm doing I
think I mentioned it earlier and there's
gonna be a humungous Beauty giveaway so
wow it was a lot of nail varnish yeah
which you guys can win I might have a
look through so give us any of those
sneaky fronts of keeping that's a nice
shade yeah like that one
very nice Wow so heavy inside this one
there was an invitation to a breakfast
event with benefit and it obviously
looks like he'd catch up these guys just
do the
event invitations and the event always
lives up to the invitation itself so
this says 1976 breakfast with a twist at
the rise and prime cafe so I guess
probably launching a primer which very
much okay with although I wonder if it's
actually going to be the official launch
of this one yeah I bet it is it's the
same kind of colors which I'm okay with
because apps that you love this primer
happy to get my hands on another one
maybe I can include it in another
giveaway so let's see blah blah blah
amazing honestly such a fun imitation
what do I do with this now
it's frame it put like in the corner
somewhere keep it in the kitchen just
for giggles I'm not actually sure what
this one is or who it's from but I
always get quite excited when I don't
know who they're from
it's always a surprise so let's see
what's in this one so it is the latest
love me beauty box let's have a little
look at the goodies inside well just a
couple of things in this one that's
interesting a green bomb and a mini
toner
I think that's unusual for mo need to
come with two things slightly
disappointing and another one that looks
exactly the same
I wonder if it's got the same stuff in
it so two different things in this one
as an eye of Horace brown liquid
eyeliner and dr. poor poor lip balm very
strange that they sent two boxes with
two things in got not sure what this one
is joy Norma's packaging let's have a
little look inside I think these the
envelopes always like put rubbish all
over my bed sheet so I need to be really
careful putting this one inside this
ginormous envelope there is a cute
little bag from Estee Lauder which is
very exciting I'm looking forward to
seeing what little goodies it got in
here let's have a little look ooh la la
we have got revitalizing supreme light
global anti-aging cream oil-free for
normal to combination skin and that's
how the look so this says is it
moisturiser
I guess so cream ultra light multi
action silk creme with a power to reduce
the look of a signs of aging oh very
interesting
we need to switch up my daily
moisturizer cause I'm finding Charlotte
Tilbury magic cream too thick so I will
be giving that to go next that sounds
really lovely and I always love Estee
Lauder moisturizers in fact let's have a
look in here the other one that I really
love is this one which is that clear
difference one really good for
combination skins it's a gel as opposed
to a really thick cream and then also
micro essence infusion mask I love
little mask sachets so this says apply
onto clean skin twice a week remove from
the packet and place on the face leave
on for 10 minutes then remove are you
sure what it does but I'll give that a
go later
and then we have a ginormous purple
envelope I never know what to do with
all my envelopes
I always just store them in the loft for
like just in case but rather a lot of
they're so like other own charities that
need envelopes and try and think any
recommendations let me know how cute is
this so KJ who are a fragrance PR
company have sent over some Christmas
goodies
this is a Bulbul with a mini Cartier
fragrance in it that is going straight
on my tree that's adorable then a liar
which I'm hoping that PO pronounce it is
a fragrance haven't actually tried
before I think this is like a handbag
sized Oh de parfum and to go with that
they've sent this little cube of
chocolates which is just absolutely
adorable they've got little dress
details perfume bag and a belt on this
cute little box so that's very generous
from kg a thank you very much guys merry
Christmas to you too
and finally I have a rather large box
from in the style and I've never
actually worked with them before that
but I keep seeing them all over my
Instagram so they kindly asked me to
choose a couple of bits from their
website so I'll show you bits and bobs
which I chose that are hopefully inside
here so we've got a pair of shoes which
I chose and I remember these looks
rather lovely on the websites let's have
a look if they are as lovely in real
life and they are they are these lovely
dark gray almost black ankle boots with
this tassel detail and I seem to
remember these a really good price like
I think around the 30 pound marks are
really good and with the zip fastening
and nice chunky heel just thought it'd
be nice way to dress a pair of jeans and
I don't really have any dark boots jeans
aren't like really expensive leather
ones so
yeah I think I'll get quite a lot of use
out of those and I also chose this
rather lovely and very snuggly looking
jacket it's quite similar to one which
they used to have in Topshop maybe still
do which is around the 80 pound mark and
I think this was around half that price
so it's unlike faux suede and faux
sheepskin with these gorgeous little
pockets and it just looks so warm and
snuggly just kind of want to wear it now
instead of my dressing-gown looks
gorgeous so I'm going to take this with
me for want to go to mums for Christmas
because it looks lovely for our Boxing
Day walk very warm and cozy yay so I've
been very spoiled lots of lovely bits
and bobs all over the place and now I
have to tidy up all of this mess so me
and Charlie are feeling super duper lazy
this evening and we've just used deliver
I think it was um
to get honest Burger delivered and I've
invested buck it was like pre encouraged
something amazing never done it before
so and shoot see if it's still gonna be
hot and everything fingers crossed a bit
greaser
maybe as good as having it actually
there do you get the same thing yeah
except more in this gluten-free wine
country so con honest burger and this is
that festive one which I think what is
this is bacon and Ruby and cranberry oh
nice couch bully yeah frozen a my little
boy is so glossy after his shampoo just
taking my makeup off and about to get
into bed now feel like today's vlog is
literally just me washing the dog and
opening up some blogger mail so
apologies if it's very boring Congrats
if you even made it this far
leave me a comment with ho-ho-ho in it
if you made it as far of to see if
anybody actually watched this one to the
end because I have a feeling it's just a
bit of a boring one but on the plus side
when you're watching this I'll be
Christmas Eve which means Christmas
tomorrow
and yeah tomorrow it's gonna be quite
fun me and Charlie doing some SuperDuper
last-minute Christmas shopping and then
we're gonna head to my mum's house and
we've got some really nice festive
things on so hopefully that will make up
for tonight's today's very boring vlog
and yeah so had our burgers watch The
Inbetweeners movie and I think we're
gonna watch a bit Luther now textures
crying downstairs I had him in bed with
me last night and now he's he's very
lonely but the plus side he smells
amazing

morning and I'm wearing my pajamas like
