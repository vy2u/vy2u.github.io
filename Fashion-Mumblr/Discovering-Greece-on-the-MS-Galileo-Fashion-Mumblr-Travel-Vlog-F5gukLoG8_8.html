trying to set myself challenges of
starting blogs in the best places ever
so we've had a couple of vlogs that are
started from a cave but today's vlog is
starting from a rock it is in the middle
of the Aegean Sea so this is my current
surroundings
we've got Charlie on a pineapple we've
got our boat over there and I'm pretty
much just round so Charlie and I are
here in Greece for the next week we are
sailing around the island with variety
cruises and our boat is that one over
there and it's the MS Galileo so we set
sail last night from Athens and today we
are right now on a little island
have a look at this charlie is there
Charlie's been taken for a little ride
Oh
so this evening we are in the league and
Ross switch from the little bit so far
is a very authentic free tire quite
quiet which is really really nice
tomorrow on Santorini yes quite Menzel's
and Bobby I'm sorry me
we spent the past half an hour just
looking around the town we've got a
small bus from the court to Kouros
pronounced or written chorus which i
think it's the capital just like the
biggest issue I have capital sin is
still Greek probably nothing not okay
you got kind of do I'm kind of you
because some three miles yeah shut up
sorry you get huh yeah I can do this
hope you got strength going you're
living our life of Education we've just
been having a look around all the
internal streets they're very typical
Greek whitewash with the blue shutters
and it's gorgeous kind of heavily ground
so quite a nice authentic start to the
truth isn't it darling
yes very mean yeah and we've just found
a nice-looking restaurants we've ordered
some nice Greek food and feeling hungry
today our boat has moored up at
Santorini I've been so excited to come
and visit the legendary Greek island so
the moment we are here in fira which is
one of the capital / the main town of my
touristy no rely very very busy courses
starting the day with an ice cream toast
got me a nice - statue ice cream but
we're not going to spend too long in
Paris on your job here as we've been
told that we need to get to here which
is the very typical white village that
you see in the photos we need to get
there nice and early for some massive
tourist mask amount of tourist descent
so that's so we're going to go now we've
been told that the buses run quite
regularly and they're quite cheap so
that's how we're going to get to here
we're going to spend a few hours there
and then
good morning folks our fourth day in
Greece today and we have moved up in
Paris which is another fu speech for
little quite authentic local islands so
today we have taken up the one of the
boats excursions so one of the great
things about RIT cruises is when you
dock up at any of the ports they offer
excursions and kind of tours around the
island so that's what we're doing today
yesterday was quite manic in Santorini I
didn't get to vlog that much so it's
quite overwhelming and I hope you'll be
able to block a little bit more today so
yeah we're doing this walking tour of
Paris at the moment we're just walking
through the old town I just showed you a
few clips of the church but I couldn't
really blog like this in a church
exactly tad disrespectful so I think at
the moment we're just going to find a
few like local monuments and then we're
going to put on a bus to a different
part of the island so far Paris is Paris
of course I'll write it down here
really really beautiful island very
typical kind of what you imagine a Greek
art look like you've got these beautiful
white buildings as pink
sugan vilius style flowers all over the
place really really stunning so many
cute little boutiques as well something
today we are in Mykonos
we spent the morning by the beach there
was a beach about 50 minute walk away
from where our boat moored up so China I
spent the day there and now we're just
exploring the main town of Mykonos it's
not cooler now it's probably about 37
degrees earlier would you say to us
yeah pretty warm hi yes high 30s whereas
now it's down to a lovely 28 degrees
that we're just looking around the town
it's not more high-end when I was
expecting Charlie said Mykonos is kind
of like the San Tropez of the Greek
islands but so far we've spotted and a
Balenciaga and the cost is even a
Sephora and Victoria's Secrets so just
have a look around all the shopping the
streets now
bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
