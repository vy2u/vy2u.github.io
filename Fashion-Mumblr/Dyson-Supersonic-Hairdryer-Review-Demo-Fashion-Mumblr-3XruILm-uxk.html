you can tell a little bit flustered from
just taking those thumbnail photos I
hope you found the thumbnail of this
video amusing it was certainly fun to
take those photos and but yes welcome
back or welcome if you are new to my
channel if you've not been here before
hello I'm Josie I make fashion and
beauty videos and travel and lifestyle
and all that jazz two or three or
sometimes four times a week so if you
don't want to miss any videos from me
then hit the little subscribe button
down there and then you will not miss
any of my future videos which would be
wonderful and so in today's video I
thought I would talk about this bad boy
it is the Dyson supersonic hair dryer
and I featured this a couple of times on
my snapchat and oh my gosh you guys
wanted to know so much about this I had
so many questions so to save my poor
little fingers from typing away the same
thing a million times I don't have a
slight exaggeration I thought I would
make a video to tell you all about it so
as you may know there is a bit of an
elephant in the room when it comes to
this because of the price tag this is
299 pounds and 99 pence so it is not
cheap and for that reason it's a big
investment and something that you're
probably gonna put quite a lot of
thought into purchasing if you do decide
to purchase it so I thought it'd be
useful to make a video to answer some
question
and give my honest thoughts on the Dyson
hairdryer to make this video a little
bit more interesting I'm actually going
to be comparing and the Dyson supersonic
hairdryer to this which is the Lee
Stafford cocoloco hairdryer and this is
one tenth of the price of a Dyson
hairdryer so this is $29.99 and I have
to say I also really like this hairdryer
firstly I mean look at it it's pink and
rose gold and it works very well so I'm
going to be very interesting to not only
give a thorough review of the Dyson but
also compare it to a and also new
hairdryer that is one tenth of the cost
okay so let's get into the review first
of all the Dyson supersonic it comes in
this box the box itself is really heavy
which actually kind of scared me
whenever I just I was like wow I do not
have the arm strength to be able to hold
a hairdryer that heavy but thankfully
the hairdryer is much much lighter than
the box itself as you would imagine for
something that costs almost 300 pounds
the box is very informative it has got
lots of information on it it has the
main benefits of the Dyson hairdryer
here on the front so it says helps
prevent extreme heat damage to protect
natural shine fast drying engineered for
balance and has a smoothing and nozzle
so they are the main benefits of the
Dyson supersonic and then on the back
you've got a almost like a diagram of
the hairdryer itself with let's see with
19 different snippets of information all
of which are kind of benefits for using
the hair dryer and then it also shows
you the different nozzles or attachments
which come with the hairdryer down here
inside the box this is what you'll find
so of course here is the main hair dryer
- the graphite gray and pink version on
my hair come on the box and you've also
got the two kind of normal at
and then you've got the diffuser
attachment down here and also within the
box you've got this mat which personally
for myself is rather pointless because
this would just collect dust on my
dressing table but I can imagine that if
you are in an environment where you use
your hairdryer a lot meteor a
hairdresser and or maybe you have a
beautiful not hogging your dressing
table you don't want to scratch this
could potentially be very useful another
thing to point out of this thing is that
the hairdryer doesn't actually get that
hot itself so it's not like it's a heat
protector mat although I guess it
probably could be feel straightness but
don't quote me on that minute the last
thing in the Box is this kind of like
mobile phone strap which I guess you
could attach somehow to the Dyson if you
wanted to hang it from the wall another
thing which to me is slightly pointless
my dyson animal Hoover I loved hanging
on the walks it looks pretty snazzy for
my hairdryer I just put it in the drawer
when I'm finished with it so not that
useful to me okay so let's go through
the attachments first of all the
diffuser as you can see I have long hair
very thick actually the individual has
it fine but I have a lot of ways so it
feels thick and if you're wanting to
know but yeah it's naturally very
straight whereas this diffuser is better
for short and curly hair or long and
curly hair which I do not have so I
haven't used this personally but I'd be
very interested to know if any of you
guys have and if you have then let me
know in the comments below how you get
along with it because I'd love to know
how it works but it very easily just
clips on to the hairdryer like that
really instantly on and off with the
magnetic attachment so that for me is
really useful because with other hair
dryers
screw them on you have to clip them on
takes a little bit of fapping to get
them all in our process as literally as
easy as that
super duper easy and you would basically
turn the hairdryer on and collect your
hair up in it scrunch it up to create
really beautiful defined curls that's
what I believe that it would do as I
said I've tried it the attachment that
personally I use is this one here and
this is the smooth attachment once again
it clips in place and it's got a fairly
wide but still rather concentrated flow
area
I'm sure the technical term and for me
this is the one that I use for drying my
hair on everyday basis I'd say it's a
fairly gentle nozzle it doesn't feel
like it's really blasting the hair which
I really like because it feels like it's
not doing so much damage to my hair but
if I was to want to really style my hair
get some repeatable curls and create a
perfect blow-dry then I want to switch
it over to the concentrated styling
nozzle and this one is much thinner on
the edge here so it really concentrates
the airflow and it would be really good
for styling the hair
maybe you want to use a paddle brush and
straighten your hair in which case you
want to use the dryer directly on the
brush this one would be a really good
one for that but it would take a lot
longer if you wanted to drying a whole
hair with this one so that's what's
inside the box now let's talk about the
actual Dyson supersonic hair dryer
itself first of all obviously it looks
very very different to any hair dryer I
have ever seen before
Dyson pride themselves on engineering on
being innovative as we know from their
vacuum cleaners and the hair dryer is
exactly the same they have obviously
spent a lot of time a lot of money in
making this really different and
definitely unique in a lot of ways this
part of design I originally thought was
where the air got sucked in and flown
out to the other side but that's
actually not the case this is pretty
much just a design feature because the
air gets filled
in to the hairdryer from the bottom
which is great if like me you're quite
clumsy or flipping your head upside down
all over the place when you're drying
and you've ever got your hair caught in
the back for hairdryer that has not
happened to me yet while using the Dyson
and I feel like it's a lot less likely
to happen because of filters here on
your bottom it's also removable it's so
really really easy to clean while I'm on
that note I will say that the filter on
the back of the leaf Stafford is also in
the back and also although not quite as
easily removable cutting it off right
now so also easy to clean but this is of
course the very standard typical
hairdryer shape that we know and love as
you'd expect from a 300 pound hairdryer
it feels very well made it feels like
it's made from really good materials the
buttons are brushed silver it's just it
is kind of the same texture as a dyson
vacuum cleaner we have got two in this
house so I am pretty sure that I know
what they feel like and yeah it just
looks like a very well made product on
the back here you've got two buttons on
the actual pink rim of the hairdryer
this one is a heat setting so when the
hairdryers turned on which i'll show you
in a second it gives you some LED
lighting to show you how to adjust the
heat and then this side is the airflow
so you can make it really hot and really
powerful or you can change the settings
to a personal preference and it's quite
noisy on camera although not noisy
compared to other hair dryers so I will
show you those in an overlay clip now
just so you can see what they look like
when the hairdryer is turned on down
here you've got the on/off button and
the cool blast button and they're
basically the only settings that you
have on the hairdryer so it's not too
complicated you don't need to memorize
an instruction booklet which is one
thing that I was worried about I thought
if it's going to be a super expensive
item is it going to be really
complicated to use well luckily you know
the settings are adjustable if you want
them to be but to be honest miss a time
just turn it on and turn it off again I
don't really pass around with them too
much but speaking of the noise it is a
lot less noisy than other hair dryers
that I've tried in the past and just so
you guys can experience it I'll turn it
on now so you can hear it
so that's what it sounds like it
actually does remind me of one of my
Dyson vacuum cleaners it's a softer
noise than other hair dryers not
completely silent but definitely much
quieter than previous ones that I've
used I'm now going to go into a few more
of these slightly technical details and
these are the details which for me make
it much different much more different
much different to me make it more
different which to me really
differentiate the Dyson from other hair
ties that I've used firstly I notice
that it doesn't overheat I mentioned at
the beginning it never really feels too
hot whereas every other hair dryer that
I've ever used often that gets really
hot especially now in the summer when I
don't want to be getting myself any
hotter than I already am this is a
really great design detail for me so
what makes a Dyson super special is that
it has a microprocessor within here
which I don't really know what it means
but basically it makes the hair dryer
itself an intelligent piece of kit so it
knows when it's getting too hot and it
adjusts its air flow accordingly so very
very clever and it really works to keep
the temperature of the hair dry it down
inside the hair dryer is the Dyson v9
motor that means absolutely nothing to
me but what I do know is that it's eight
times faster and half the weight of the
motors in traditional hair dryers so
you're getting a lot more power for no
extra additional weights which for me is
really important actually I haven't
mentioned this yet this is a very light
hair dryer I only need like a few
fingers to hold it up it's a very light
piece of kit and when you've got a lot
of hair like I do it can actually make
your arm really ache if you spend 20
minutes blow-drying your hair so for it
to be really light just saves me a lot
of arming so that's a really important
factor for me comparing it actually to
the lease Stanford this is also a very
very light piece of kit the body of a
lee stafford doesn't feel as expensive
as
I mean as you'd expect because it's a
tenth of the price it's beautiful but it
doesn't actually feel like terribly
high-quality material
if that doesn't volume like it doesn't
really bother me then it's absolutely
fine but don't expect to spend 30 pounds
on the hairdryer and for it to feel the
same quality obviously as a 300 pound
package while I'm talking about this one
I should note that the settings although
they may not be as fancy and intelligent
as the Dyson ones are actually the same
on this 30 pound hairdryer
you've got a cool blast button you've
got the on and off you've got three
different power settings and three
different heat settings as well so when
it comes to personalizing how your hair
dryer works 30 pound hairdryer and 300
pound hairdryer exactly the same so what
you guys probably want to know is what
do I actually think of it does it work
does it make my hair feel better is it
quicker well I'll start with the last
one is it quicker
compared to my ght air hairdryer no it's
actually no quicker as I said about a
lot of hair I rarely completely dry my
hair I normally leave it to be about 80%
dry and let the last 20% dry naturally
but I'd say that it takes about the same
amount of time with the GHD hair dryer
and the dyes new one so if you've
already got a pretty good hairdryer you
may not notice so much of a difference
however when I think back to when I had
my really old fabulous one that took a
long time so if you're upgrading from a
slightly older less sophisticated hair
dryer then you probably will notice
different Solis Stafford while it may be
a cheap hairdryer is definitely still a
very very good one you've got this
massive filled from the back this sucks
in a lot of air it might be nosy than
the Dyson but it's pretty powerful and
I'd say that it only takes me maybe like
30 seconds longer to dry my hair with
this one
that it does with the Dyson both
hairdryers have got a really long cable
I'd say the Dyson's is probably maybe
like ten centimeters longer and if your
mirror is not that closer to your
electric socket then that long cable is
a really important factor it's also got
a flexible little connector down the
bottom so you're not going to be getting
any split wires which is very good if
you want to last a long time which at
that price you definitely do for me the
main benefit and the main thing that
I've really been impressed with with the
Dyson hairdryer is the way that my hair
feels afterwards and I was praying for
there to be something just one thing
noticeable noticeably better about this
hair drive and any other hair dryers
that I found that I've tried and
thankfully that one thing really I do
notice is how my hair feels so I have
got blonde colored hair I color it a lot
I use heat on it a lot so it can be very
dry very crispy and very coarse feeling
considering it's blonde hair but when
I've used the Dyson especially in these
mid lengths of my hair the ends
they still don't feel perfect they need
a lot more conditioning to feel perfect
but especially in the mid length of my
hair it has never felt so soft I would
say that's probably thanks to the way
the air comes through this smoothing
nozzle so because it's so direct onto
the hair shaft it really does smooth
down the hair particles high particles
follicles which does result in a very
very smooth finish but going back to my
30 pound hair dryer this is infused with
coconut oil and oil on my hair they're
just best friends my hair loves oil
although I'm kind of skeptical as to how
the coconut oil actually gets to the
hair how much difference it makes either
way I find that this hair dryer does
make my hair much smoother than my older
hair dryers how that coconut infusion
works I do not know but I like the idea
of it and it works so now that we have
to address the price the Dyson
Sonicare dryer is 300 pounds and that is
a lot of money for a hair dryer it's a
lot of money . and it's a lot of money
for a hair dryer a lot of you are going
to be wanting to know is it worth it I
really think that depends on you as a
person if you struggle with your hair
and you just really need it to be
smoother you really need some good
quality machinery on your hair then yeah
it probably is worth it because I spend
300 pounds on two sets of hair coloring
and that doesn't last as long as a hair
dryer loss so when you think of it like
that it's actually not that bad a deal
considering how often you use a hair
dryer and how much of an impact your
hair make on first impressions on how
you look at how you feel so don't think
of it like that
actually not too bad however if like me
your hair actually isn't too picky
between hair dryers then I probably be
tempted to get a cheaper version and
there are so many good budget
hair dryers on the market right now as
I've mentioned throughout this video I
really like this one from these Stafford
it's beautiful it dries my hair has the
settings that I need it's light I really
can't fold this hair dryer so if I was
to see the turn the shop if I had
endless amounts of money I get the Dyson
of course because it's really small to
eat but with my actual budget I'd get
the least effort so guys that's it for
my review of the Dyson supersonic hair
dryer I hope you found this interesting
and I hope you found it interesting that
I kind of compared to of course one
being a tenth of the price of the other
hopefully that made it a little bit more
I'm relatable for you I'm sure there are
things that you're still going to want
to know if you're seriously considering
making the purchase so leave any
questions that you've got in the comment
