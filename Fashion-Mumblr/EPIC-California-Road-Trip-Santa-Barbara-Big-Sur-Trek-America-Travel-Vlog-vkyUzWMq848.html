for day 2 in Pinkberry we've come to
Santa Barbara we've driven about three
hours from LA and we're just exploring
the town at the moment
picking up a froyo and we're just going
to have a look up and down the stools
hopefully those a Sephora somewhere the
Sun has just come out I didn't start
blogging until now because until my
cloudy and nobody wants to see the
Russian guys but we have a little walk
down
and half the group is now gone
psteerenberg paddleboarding
whereas myself in angular we we decided
to go shopping and okay so I've not been
very good at vlogging today because
we've just spent the day kind of
retooled and going from cafe to Cafe and
basically trying to get on some Wi-Fi
because we've all got post to schedule
videos to upload and all of that jazz so
yeah and in between cafe stops I've been
going to a few shops I did manage to get
to Abercrombie although there were no
shirts of Charlie sadly and but I did
pick up a few pieces which I'll show you
later also went to Sephora and I picked
up about eight different matte lip
stains from different runs so I will
test you all of those out for you guys
as well right now we're heading back to
the beach we're going to get the tram
hopefully she smells optimistically and
we're going to meet Greg who is our
videographer and I think Laura is going
to do an interview on the beach and
hopefully I'm going to be able to do
some photos because I literally have no
photos of Santa Barbara
give me when I turn
that's its way
like
we have arrived at our campsite before
evening good morning everybody
it is day 3 in California and last night
we spent the night camping it wasn't too
bad actually it was a little bit bumpy
because Maddie and I set up our tent on
top of our pegs arms a little bit bumpy
but other than that all good set pretty
well it was quite a luxury campsite as
far as campsites go like there are nice
little bathrooms and showers and yeah
it's all going to get a little bit more
rough from here we're heading to Big Sur
today where we're not going to have any
internet or 4G so it's going to be a bit
of a digital detox and yeah so we've got
about three hour road trip to get to
there we are currently at a place called
Albertsons which is a giant supermarket
and we are getting some supplies for the
next few days I've been put on Lucky
Charms duty what's your item you've
gotta get Maddie where you all been
allocated an item stairs so we're going
to go and buy some supplies in the next
few days and then start the road trip
mighty crazy wooden backs a
so sure she's here take a break go
straight about halfway through our road
trip now just don't go for you don't
make it up baby hearts Castle this is
the Hearst Castle bitch yeah Hearst
Castle Beach honey oh so near me and and
we're just getting our lunch out of
lunch boxes
cuz I come alone
that's what you want
see you
Oh
because we are driving these crystal
high road and we've just stopped off at
a beautiful viewpoint a lot of elixir
which is it's a big area of protected
land and unloads kind of like build on
it and for that kind of jazz we just
stop talking this incredible
just woken up from a nice long nap in
the run everybody's just hop out to look
at another gorgeous view everywhere
along this road is so stunning look at
this view I'm going to hop out and take
some snaps and I'll show you guys how
beautiful is so you've just been very
very lucky we just pulled up here to
look at the view more than anything and
we stumbled upon a whole pod of dolphins
and it was so close literally in the
water as close to the cliff as you could
possibly get all of them just
singing the waves having
yeah it was so magical to see them there
must have been about eight or ten
dolphins all together so that was
absolutely incredible and we're just
going to hop back on the bus now and I
think the next stop is a hike
Oh
ah
no we're guys watching Spartacus oh good
you can that they could it's only good
you know okay you couldn't that's been
running already so there's no sputters
less than me if there was one it would
have it would have washed out a long
time ago
yeah make understand sure don't think my
thirstiness risk I'm not gonna risk we
have been so lucky today when it comes
to seeing things supposed to steal the
dolphins and now in the distance that is
a whale every now and then we keep
seeing him spouting and flipping his
hair out of the water
probably when girls catch it on camera
but somewhere over here
oh yeah so we are camping in bear
country so you guys are going to get to
get a briefing on bear safety tonight
and I'll show you guys how to be proper
food storage and we'll be putting things
back into the trailer this evening
maybe we'll get lucky like so you see a
bear we just don't want to see one in
our campsite thank you

going to spending the evening we are
basically in the middle of a forest by
Big Sur and we've got quite cozy little
setup going on so I'll show you around
