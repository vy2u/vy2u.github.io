really really well and had a super
weekend so today I thought I would share
with you my everyday makeup routine I've
been doing pretty much the same makeup
every single day for a few months now
and I haven't shared it with you and
today it's Monday morning I just felt
like escaping my emails for a few
minutes and I thought why not film my
makeup so it's going to be a very
informal chatty video I literally just
set the camera up having decided to film
this video about two minutes ago no
professional lighting on or anything so
just really chilled out really informal
and look hopefully interesting for you
guys so I'm going to start off by
telling you what I've already done to my
skin this probably won't come as a
surprise if you've been watching my
videos for a little while but I'm still
absolutely loving the DA fan lumia
essential range first of all after using
my slim wash on my skin so when I wake
up I use my solar water and then I
usually spray on a toner at the moment
I'm loving the trilogy rosehip spray-on
toner and then I usually just go
downstairs make a cup of tea I come
upstairs and I put a serum on this is
the darf and Lumiere essential
illuminating oil serum I've spoken about
this before so I won't go into it but I
just love the very gentle glow that it
gives to my skin and then I follow that
with a corresponding moisturizer which
is the illuminating oil gel cream really
good if you know that your skin wants a
bit of oil and but you don't want to put
some actual oil on your skin really love
this and yeah you've heard me talk about
that before so I put the two of those on
and also an eye cream I switch it up a
little bit with my eye cream I love the
NeoStrata intensive therapy which I got
from the Wigmore Street pharmacy which
is on local streets in London and find
this really good buy suffering from eye
bags so this is a really good one and I
also when I want something a little bit
richer a little bit more hydrating this
one is more creamy it's the Liz Earle
super skin eye cream so I put NeoStrata
on this morning's it's Monday and I
don't have my coffee yet needed a little
bit of deep huffing so that is what I
have on at the moment for the base I
actually don't wear a primer if I'm just
working from home
no particular reason why from going out
I would use a primer but today it's just
a working from home day it's Monday so
I'm skipping that step out today I'm
going to use the by Terry cellular rose
moisturizing CC cream my skin just seems
to love this it feels like it's really
good and nourishing on the skin and it's
a really lovely light base so I just use
one pump of that on the back of the hand
and then splodge that onto the skin
having left my moisturizer to sink in
for about 10 or 15 minutes I'll usually
get to rest in that time and finish my
coffee etc and I'm going to use my
Clinique I don't know what the official
name of this is just blending brush to
blend that in normally I would use my
mirror on the wall but I'm just using
this amazing Tom Ford palette to blend
it today so I find this brush is really
quick at blending make bin it doesn't
give a totally flawless finish so if I
want to I'll go in with my Beauty
Blender afterwards but this CC cream
just gives such a nice glowy base it's
not cakey at all if I was filming I'd
put something well I'm feeling me right
now but if I was going to be spending a
day doing filming I probably use
something a bit thicker like the Rimmel
what's it called match perfection this
is what I have and I'm filming if you
guys ever wanted to know I will put a
bit of the CC cream over my lips I don't
know why I just always do and then I
take it all the way over like my brow
bone trying not to get too much in my
hair ever since I went even blonder um I
really noticed makeup in the hair it's a
bit of a blonde hair problem if anyone
knows any solutions let me know so while
this hasn't covered up all of my red
marks I've got a little bit of spot
actually going on over here it's a no
tie my hair back actually
yeah the CC cream doesn't hide all
blemishes but it just gives a really
lovely more even base which for me if
I'm working from home in the daytime is
more than enough so what next I'm going
to put on a little bit of concealer just
under my eyes again not everyday would I
do this but just be who you are going to
put some concealer on one
I really like include the origins plant
scription this is on its last legs I'm
gonna have to chuck it out soon it's
getting a little bit old and also the
Clarins instant concealer for tired eyes
I don't know if that's just some clever
naming off the product but I feel like I
always have tired eyes so this is one
that I do reach for I've got way too
much on my finger I would recommend like
an eighth of a grain of rice you really
don't need that much at all as you can
see it's quite pigmented so I pop that
on under my eyes and then I'm gonna
blend this in with a Beauty Blender I've
gone through quite a few beauty blenders
recently because Dexter has decided that
he really likes to shred them so they
are rather expensive to have to keep
buying so I'm gonna have to be more
strict on Dexter and keep them out of
sight but as you can see that concealer
has just sunk in really really quickly
really really really really quickly
and then I just well I've got the Beauty
Blender in my hand just make sure that
there are no swirl marks from the
foundation or CC cream which to be
honest there aren't normally because it
is just a tinted moisturizer so yes
really nice easy natural glowy base
during the winter I do find that my lips
gets a little bit dry and at this stage
they usually want a bit of comforting so
I have a few options as I reach for
regularly first of all this is a Burt's
Bees lip balm crayon and it does give a
little bit of color then I love the
nooks Rev de miel I feel like I only
discovered this a whole lot later than
everybody else like at the end of last
year love it but it's quite gloopy so I
prefer to use that at night in the day
my favorite is the Shanta chi this is
the lipstick Rouge Shalev in the shade
Mirage it is a lipstick but I still find
it really bombing and is really
comfortable to wear and I absolutely
adore the color of this one so having
applied that my lips feel lovely and
hydrated but also I just love the color
if I was to do a 2016 beauty favorites
this would definitely be in there
speaking of which do you guys still want
to see one of those it's January the 8th
today I
I've missed the boat but if you're
interested in a huge yearly favourites
of everything that I love last year let
me know because you know never too late
I could still do that so now that my
lips are feeling a bit more hydrated I'm
going to move on to the eyebrows so this
is not my full eyebrow routine just
something to give them a little bit more
shape for the everyday situation I get a
lot of you guys asking why I feel the
need to fill in my brows after I've had
the micro bladed and that's because on
my skin the micro bleeding faded quite
quickly in a few places so while the
overall shape of the brows is so much
better like I would be comfortable going
on like a beach day for example without
putting anything on my brows because the
shape really is there thanks to the
micro bleeding
I do have brow makeup so I do prefer to
just give them a little bit more
structure so my current favorite brow
combination is a bobbi brown eyeshadow
this one is the shade gray you can
basically use any brown eyeshadow if
you're looking for a high street our
brow kit I recommend Rimmel brow this
way I think it's called and then just
whatever brushes you prefer I actually
prefer my Anastasia Beverly Hills one
because it's super thin the the slanted
brush is just really really thin so it
gets a really nice precise shape but
that's full and down the back of my
dresser and I can't me to get it so I'm
using an earlier one at the moment and
then this is just a spoolie so I brush
out the brows to get a little bit of
shape and then fill in any patches where
I want a little bit more intense color
using this eyeshadow so mostly I'm just
focusing on this area here where my brow
hair is a little bit sparse also I had
my brows shaped and tinted had the kind
of its benefits dawn Carnaby Street and
I just find that makes so much
difference on Sundays when I don't have
my brows done I just can't do anything
with my brows like they look so rubbish
but now that I've had them tinted and
shaped I just find them a million times
easier and quicker to do okay so that's
super quick and easy I spent about 20
seconds if that just putting a little
bit of color in the brows and now I'm
going to set them with an eyebrow gel
again there's a few that I really like
my favorite is benefit gimme brow
although I appreciate that it's a little
bit pricey and I also really like this
one which is Rimmel brow this way brow
styling gel what I do really like about
gimme brow is the fact that the brush is
really small and you can actually this
is what they always do want to get my
brows done buy them they back comb the
brows so if you really do want that big
bushy brow look which I really like I
wish I had more brow hair so that I
could do it a bit more intensely but
they back comb the brows and then brush
them up I will attempt it but yeah I
wouldn't normally make this much effort
on an everyday brow makeup routine
please excuse the sunlight beaming in
from behind me but that's great so it
means I can do some blog photography
today if it's gonna be nice and bright
so I'm just taking this spoolie and
really just ruffling it through the
brows and that's given a little bit more
volume to the brow shape and that's
pretty much all I would do for my brows
for an everyday makeup look nothing too
snazzy by the way I'm wearing my Topshop
jumper that I featured in my January
sales haul part 1 from Topshop I just
love it this material is so soft it's so
nice for working from home days so yeah
just in case you're wondering what I'm
wearing it's that one next I'm going to
move on to eyeshadow I'm not actually
sure I've talks about this before but I
absolutely love it and I use it so much
this is my girl an eye shadow in the
shade for hey nude it comes in this like
gold bar box which is totally
over-the-top and extravagant but I love
it inside it looks like this so you've
got a big mirror I still haven't taken a
sticker off it's very unlike me
satisfying moment alert
I don't know why I find that so it says
fine so yeah and then it did have its
own little brush in there but I found it
totally useless it fell out once and I
don't think I even bothered to pick it
up but then the eye shadow itself is
this long bar here it's a very neutral
skin colored color I find it very good
for just creating a really lovely base
somedays this is all I'll apply it some
days I will build up the mirror is the
perfect shape and size for application
and then I use a big this is the zoeva a
two-to-one luxe soft crease brush it's
probably better for buffing and but I
find it's so big it makes it super quick
to apply the eyeshadow so just sweeping
that all over the lid and then blending
it to about halfway up a bit of the lid
don't know what that's called so you can
see it's added a little bit of color to
my eyelid but without being too intense
and then I just make sure that it's not
got any harsh lines just blending that
in a little bit and to be honest what I
do next just varies on day to day
depending on how I'm feeling I recently
was clearing out my makeup drawer and
rediscovered this beautiful palette from
Becca and I'm really loving these shades
in particular the palette is called
hombre Rouge eye palette and once again
really beautiful very natural color
selection if you're like me and you love
really warm tones on your makeup nothing
too extravagant then this is a really
lovely one so I'm going to go in with
this slightly pinky brown shade just a
little bit on the same brush because
cutting board to switch them up and then
I'm just gonna trace the crease and this
will add a little bit more definition
add a little bit more depth to the eye
makeup look but still super easy I am
NOT a makeup artist wouldn't even sound
particularly skilled at doing my makeup
so if I can do this on everyday basis
then you sure as heck you can as well so
that's just so easy I'm just going to
blend this out just to make it look even
more natural as I said if I was not
filming I probably wouldn't even do this
step and then to make this even softer
I'm taking a clean
blending brush this oh I think this is a
fake Bobby Brown one that I got on eBay
yeah it's clean so I'm just going to use
that to blend out any lines so that it's
really lovely and soft from my everyday
look when I say fake Bobby Brown it
doesn't have like Bobby Brown branding
on it but I mean obviously it's been
created to look like a Bobby Brown brush
eBay is so good for makeup brushes by
the way if you don't want to spend a
fortune
obviously I'd always recommend so easy
for brushes because they're amazing but
if you do want a serious bargain then
eBay is the place to go okay I'm happy
with my eyeshadow next I'm going to go
in with mascara
I don't want eyeliner on an everyday
basis if I did want to intensify my eye
look then I would probably even take a
really small eyeshadow brush and just
put a darker shade under my lash line
but I don't do that most days so next
I'm going to use mascara you guys
probably know this already but I'm still
absolutely loving the Elizabeth Arden oh
my god I think I always call this the
show-stopping mascara
I've just seen that it's actually called
the ground entrance mascara I've been
wrong for like half of the year last
year so Saul's about that Elizabeth
Arden grand entrance mascara I've tried
to so many mascaras I've chucked out so
many more scars recently because none
compared to this it really does just
separate lifts volume eyes everything
but without being clumpy so perfect for
an everyday mascara look evening mascara
look I just love it and they always call
my lashes first I'm using Shu oh no
tweezer month rose gold lash colors I do
have the Primark version as well which
are fraction of the price and to be
honest they are identical so just a
couple of squeezes I usually squeeze in
two separate places to really lift as
opposed to bend the eyelashes and then I
feel like this mascara is only going to
last maybe another week or so because
it's pretty much empty almost dried outs
but look at that brush this is a stiff
brush and it hurts like hell if you get
it in your eyes so always be super
careful with this it's really bristly
really long bristles but it's vicious so
just trying to position that as close to
my actual eyelid as possible giving
a bit of a wiggle and then I put a teeny
tiny bit on the lower lash line I don't
want to add too much heaviness but just
because my lower lashes are blonde
they just need a tiny touch of mascara
and then I'm going to flip the brush
round because it's arch and the brush
bristles are different lengths on either
side I'm going to flip it round to give
it a little bit more volume well I've
got your attention I feel like everybody
is talking about this YouTube algorithm
change and it means that a lot of you
may not be seeing all my videos so if
you do want to keep up to date there is
a little bail button next to the
subscribe button which hopefully you've
already pressed and if you don't want to
miss any you can put the bail button on
just click it and then it means that
you'll be notified when I upload which
surely is the point if you'll subscribe
to someone but YouTube decided to mess
everything up as they'd like to do so if
you don't want to miss anything hit that
little Bell button down there um yeah I
feel like so many youtubers have been
noticing a real drop in their views some
people have even been unsubscribed from
people's channels which is very
frustrating um hopefully that's not
happened double check that you are still
subscribed if you want to be what else
have I got to chat to you guys about or
you keep asking to see more of Dexter
I'll go get him in a second so that you
can see him he really is the best dog in
the whole world we met another sausage
dog yesterday on the common that was
identical to him like literally
identical and he made friends of them
straight away with other dogs he'll sit
there and bark and try and be ferocious
but with other sausage dogs he just he
knows that they're the same and makes
friends with them so it's really lovely
ok mascara is looking good what next
what next I sometimes put a little bit
of powder on just to mattify today skin
wise I don't hugely feel like I need it
but I will put a tiny bit on just to
show you I love the Sean Takai HD for
fetching powder I've got it in bronze
and in neutral if I feel like something
a bit lighter I use a press powder
hadn't really figured out which one is
my favourites I
like the bobbi brown retouching powder I
also really like the YSL souffle dip let
it's so big though it takes so much
space in my makeup drawer I adore this
one is a press powder
it's the foreign one pressed mineral
makeup broad-spectrum SPF 15 from pure I
have a suave ski version yes be honest
I'm not too fussy with powders they're
just a few that I reach for regularly
mostly I'll try to apply powder in a
more targeted way I don't want to
mattify my entire face so I'm taking a
Real Techniques old metals 300 brush and
I'm just gonna put that on there and
then Pat it under my eyes this is where
I don't want my makeup just appearing
and on my chin I find that it just helps
to set the makeup and diminish any
potential with shiny patches so I'm
really more targeted with this than
splurging it all over my face because I
don't want to be totally matte so
hopefully that will help my makeup lasts
a little bit longer
oh hello sunshine and then finally I
think I'm gonna put on some bronzer my
favorite overall bronzer is the
hourglass one I can't see it so I've got
it here I'm going to use my Tom Ford
this one I find really good for everyday
because it's not too pigmented
you'd think from Tom Ford it'll be like
boom really glamorous big pigmented
powder but it's not it's ginormous I
love the packaging it's a really soft
bronze so I'm gonna take that on my
Charlotte Tilbury brush you're right
back Oh had celine for that one okay
this is my favorite bronzing brush of
all time Charlotte Tilbury haven't
really found any that I prefer to this I
lost it a little while ago and had a bit
of a spaz attack and but amazingly the
Pyaasa a new one and I was so grateful
so thank you Charlotte Tilbury gals if
you're watching so I just I don't go too
crazy have a big old swirl and then I
always always start on the cheekbones
because if I do have a bit too much
color it's really good to blend there it
gives your face a little bit more shape
and then to be honest I don't want any
lines so I just blend it all in quick
tip if you do want to have a little bit
more of a contour to
face just squeeze your bronzer brush in
like this and then you can create a bit
more of a line cutter I'm not the queen
of contouring but that's just little
something something that I like to do so
we're really just frame the face use my
bronzer as a face shaper and also a
warmer opera for the complexion which we
all need this time of year has anyone
got any holidays book to please tell me
if you've got any warm holidays books I
want to dream about warm destinations
hopefully booking somewhere soon with
chess but nothing is confirmed yet so
yeah now I'm just blending like crazy I
don't want any lines on it to be really
natural so just blend blend blend to be
honest that's pretty much it yeah I
would say this is what I do to my face
on an everyday basis obviously if I'm
literally at home doing nothing all day
I won't put this much effort in but okay
this is gonna make me sound so shallow
but if I'm gonna be doing stuff like
Instagram stories all the snapchat
stories or vlogging then I don't want to
look like a scary Mary so I do put on a
little bit of makeup also today I'm
going to the doctor shortly and then we
popping into town so again I just I like
to have a little bit more makeup on
makes me feel more comfortable if you go
to school go to uni or just have a job
that doesn't require you to be perfectly
made up I feel like this amount of
makeup would be perfect I have this
makeup routine down to a fine arts and I
can probably do this in sorry I've got
really itchy nose I can probably do this
in about two to three minutes although
don't quote me on that because I'm sure
if I timed myself and be more like five
but still this is the routine that I do
pretty much every single day I am really
rambling now because um no one else is
home and you guys are all I have to talk
to you but I'm gonna go and get Dexter I
did promise that I would show you him so
be right back here he is I went
downstairs looking for him I thought he
was going to be in our bed
because Charlie doesn't allow Dexter on
our bed but I do and he loves to just
snuggle up in our duvet so I thought
that's where he was going to be but
actually he was downstairs hence why I'm
out of breath
oh is it weird that I even like his dog
Spratt I feel like when you love someone
so much you love everything about them
whether that's their smelly feet well
there's so many breath or anything else
that's me but no he was downstairs by
the fire we've got our little gasifier
lit at the moment cuz our heating is
broken again
I feel like we have the worst boiler in
the whole world but um yeah no heating
no hot water in the house at the moment
but on the plus side it means I go to
the gym more because I have to shower at
the gym so swings and roundabouts but
yeah here is little chappy he's very
fluffy today because yesterday we took
him for a walk on the common and it
started to pour with rain so much and he
got filthy he was so dirty you've
covered in mud and being a little boy he
decided to roll in it and be stupid
naughty so we had to bath him in a cold
bath I felt so bad um but then we gave
him lots of cuddles and treats and warm
blanket cuddles afterwards so he's
really fluffy because he had a little
bath yesterday and he smells so would
haha so yes if he wanted to see Dexter
here he is my little handsome Sherpa
Rooney no stinking God he yawns all the
time I've been home camera good so I
hope you guys have had a really good
start to your week thank you so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this little
chatty
get ready with me um so yeah I'm gonna
say goodbye now
what do I got to do stay got to go to
the docks shortly when Charlie got back
gets back from the gym and then I've got
a few blog posts right I'm going to edit
this video get it out for you guys
tonight and then I'm gonna have another
wardrobe declutter get rid of a load of
stuff to hopefully go to a car boot sale
