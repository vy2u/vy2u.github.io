video this is the first video in my
first ever edit now this edit is going
to be my spring edit which is basically
going to be a collection of some of my
favorite types of videos to film all
based around springtime so I've got four
or five I haven't really decided videos
planned and I'm going to be doing them
all this week so make sure you are
subscribed if you don't want to miss any
of my spring videos I decided to do my
first ever edit for springtime because
as I said it is my favorite season I
absolutely love spring and there are
just so many things I wanted to share
with you including beauty fashion and
lifestyle so definitely make sure you
subscribe so you don't miss any of my
spring edit videos I'm kicking off the
spring edit with a drugstore everyday
makeup routine this is the finished look
so carry on watching if you'd like to
see how I do it
this is the kind of makeup that I wear
everyday if I'm leaving the house going
into town to meet some friends or going
for meetings but I probably do a
slightly pared down version of this look
maybe this tinted moisturizer and a lip
balm instead of a lipstick if I'm just
staying at home so enough from me I hope
you enjoyed this tutorial first of all
I'm getting my hair out of my face by
putting my sunglasses on my head before
priming my skin with collections primed
and ready primer and this has got
ingredients by which so it's really good
for fighting any potential blemishes and
then I'm going in with bourgeoise City
radiance foundation this is a really
lovely light foundation for everyday
wear it still gives enough coverage but
without being too heavy on the skin and
I'm using my zoeva silk finish brush
just to Pat this one into the skin to
give it a bit more coverage then I'm
using the arrow boost lip balm and this
is one by Birchbox so this is a lovely
farm it just moisturize my lips after
foundation and also gives them a hint of
color and then I'm using a brow pencil
by it cosmetics just to lightly fill in
my brows next I conceal with bourgeois
radiance reveal concealer it's the same
collection that as the foundation that I
used and I'm dotting that underneath my
eyes and patting it in using the
from my finger pads just to make sure it
blends into my foundation before going
in with my nan Beautyblender
Beautyblender sponge and for a bit more
coverage and a bit of highlights and
using L'Oreal's of True Match concealer
my chin nose and also a little bit on my
forehead and because it's a bit lighter
acts as a bit of a highlight too and
again patting it in with my fingers
before blending and pouting with my
Beauty sponge for the eyes I'm using it
almost magnifies this is just so easy
you literally scribble it onto the
eyelids it's such a quick and easy way
of doing your eye makeup so I've just
scribbled the darker shade all over and
blending with my fingers and then I'm
going to use the lighter shade to line
underneath my eyes which just really
brightens them up and again it's super
easy with the one pencil just does both
things I'm gonna use one of my zoeva
new rose golden brushes just to blend
that out as you can see I've not been
precise at all
it's just such an easy but nice and
natural-looking every day I look then
i'm curling my lashes and my lovely rose
gold tweezerman lash curlers before
going in with Rimmel's volume colorist
mascara which is supposed to gradually
tint the lashes I haven't noticed
much of a difference yet but I'm
sticking with it because it's such a
lovely idea and then I'm using soap and
Glory's solar powder bronzer to add a
little bit of color to my face I'm just
applying that to the cheekbones and up
onto my forehead anywhere the Sun would
naturally catch again keeping it really
nice and natural blending that in quite
thoroughly then I'm using the Rimmel
Kate contour palette again using another
zoeva brush taking that middle dark
shade to add a very very natural contour
and then another zoeva brush taking the
highlight which is a really lovely
natural highlight not too sparkly just
in the top of my cheekbones and finally
the bottom blush shade just to add a
nice spring a pop of color and because I
want a bit more drama to my lashes I'm
using a very own mascara which is a
really good second layer mascara really
helps to separate out the lashes and add
a little bit more volume
then because I'm very classy I'm using
some toilet relative locked and my lip
balm off before going in the smash boxes
coral lip liner I do love this one but
Rimmel exaggerate is a really good to
keep in cheaper version and then I'm
using a L'Oreal color riche lipstick to
add a really lovely bolt coral coral
pink color these lipsticks are lovely
and moisturizing and because I want a
little bit more of a coral pop I'm using
a bourgeois rouge velvet a souffle at
lip balm and I really love the color of
this it's really lovely for layering as
well to finish I'm using the Loreal
infallible fixing mist and this will
just make sure that I don't need to top
up my makeup for the rest of the day and
this is it my finished everyday spring
makeup look using drugstore or budget
