very first every day May and now I'm not
too sure if I've actually made that up
or if it's actually a YouTube tag
I might have dreamt it but either way
I'm going to be trying to vlog every day
during May because me and Charlie I've
got a lot of fun things going on he's
already gone out the door yeah we've got
lots of things going on I don't think
I've got one day this month I'm just
going to sitting around doing nothing so
I thought I really wanted to share it
with you guys there's gonna be lots of
traveling lots of really really exciting
events and just general things going on
starting with today it's actually the
last day of April today but I wanted to
get hopefully a video up for the first
day of May and we are in Copenhagen
today in Denmark and we've been invited
out here by the company that I went to
Costa Rica ways who look after his win
and myself and another blogger called
Natalia who blogs at trendy tastes she's
a Spanish blogger we're gonna be giving
a bit of a seminar talk all about
blogging and how brands can engage with
luggers so it's 8 o'clock in the morning
now we're gonna go and meet the team
some breakfast and then get the seminar
started
so we finished the talk when here in the
advance offices and we'd escape Q&amp;amp;A is
all about our brands
influences and we were using the piss
win case study so I think now I'm gonna
go in with Natalia we're just having a
tour around the advance office and they
offer little options to their staff for
the shoes that they use for their comp
eat soups so if someone has bid 600 for
these ones and they are it's a little
bit later now the talk went really well
didn't it darling fantastic fantastic it
was really good so nominal nominal
respect I'm okay unbelievable immense so
much so it's basically Natalia who was
another of the pissed when Sun are not
servers and I we were just talking into
kind of like heads of digital brand
managers those kind of people about how
brands should work with logos so it's
really interesting to just share our
thoughts and it's also very interesting
and it's also really interesting to see
how much or how little brands know about
work
so yeah really fun little talk and then
all of us the PES grin team we all went
out for a really typical Danish lunch
which was very alcohol people girls and
it we had this like yes rocket oh my god
absolutely smelt it and I was like
contract that I'm drunk just when you
smell so that was pretty fun and then we
just had a little walk around town and
then we headed back to our apartment
for an hour or so because it was
starting to get a little bit rainy and I
just put up with some emails fun times
and now we're heading back into town
because the Sun has kind of come out for
those has never get a little bit now and
we're heading towards the harbour is
that I don't know you know we're just so
hard but it's not really know it's
inside yeah joking behind it's pretty
much yeah we're just basically gonna
have done look around the shops run here

just I see beautiful so yeah just gonna
find somebody to eat so much shop and
that's the one
so have few glasses of wine down by the
harbor and I'm feeling a little bit drop
it now aren't we darling

have to ask quite basically there's a
little boy saying I think it wasn't very
well and he was in the office with his
mom and he just pushed his seat forward
push the seat backwards I just went
right in case of serious window serious
here we go here's our dinner location
it's actual burger
good morning so we're spending a full
day exploring Copenhagen this day which
spent most of the morning just walking
around on foot we had an amazing
breakfast in the space that one of my
friends recommended and it was probably
the most instruments they've ever seen
in my life so I had a really lovely
react was quite a late one we had a bit
of a lion and then we basically went and
looked around a few shops but Charlie
Ward Hugh they
so I become ATC favorite shop at the
moment so it's continued and also the
home where shops here are so nice so we
bought a few plates and mugs for charlie
utterly just stop now for some carrot
cake and coffee and we're gonna spend
the rest of the afternoon choppin and
then we're heading home later on rain
rain rain up all the time so it's making
the most of sunshine Charlie and I are
in home where heaven is literally the
style of all of our stuff at home same
brand and now we've just come across
this little concession of ones who are
and this is the same brown because all
the crockery that we loved in South
Africa very tempted to get one of these
little espresso cups it's so cute
even the Tupperware out here is look at
this yeah even the tea towels here are
nicer than they are in the UK want to
get one
if anybody else is as obsessed with
homewares as for me and Charlie are then
Copenhagen is definitely a place to cut
in they're dying
oh yes all brands that we are obsessed
with including 1qr which we saw in South
Africa I fell in love with which was me
just down the road from where we went on
Safari
it's so clear essentially every single
track products that we love and the
bathrooms are pretty nice as well it's
almost ESOP style this is Franklin
Meraki which is really really nice if
anyone climbers Ryanair with all those
limitations we would stop
just got back to the apartment after
spending the afternoon walking around
town we had a really nice burger at this
place called mad I keep noticing places
that are talking about having hair food
beef which is exciting for me as I'm
from Hera put on the act who just got
back to the apartment now don't if I
mentioned what was saying in an Airbnb
know we've never well I've never stayed
in Airbnb before it's been good it's
been a nice successful alternative to
staying in a hotel room oh gosh I blend
into a sofa tragic so we're gonna start
packing up our things now and then order
a taxi in about half an hour and then
we're on our way home again so we are in
Copenhagen Airport now we got dropped
off by our uber in the kiss and go
