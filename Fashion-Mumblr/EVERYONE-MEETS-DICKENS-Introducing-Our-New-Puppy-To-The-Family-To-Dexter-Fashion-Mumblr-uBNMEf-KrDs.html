bit reserved yeah mentally she just is

worship carrier getting the most
important action next returning he's
also going to be like not really

at my feet in his little bed and Dexter
was on my lap Dexter is still being very
demanding he is used to being an only
child but he's also being very loving
and brotherly already so very pleased to
see that my boys are getting along and
I'm just so excited to see how their
love develops for each other but yeah
everyone's reactions was just exactly
what we thought it would be I think 20
rechtin was the cutest she couldn't
believe that he was ours and just wanted
to cuddle him the whole time and as you
saw we also had little birthday cakes
amongst at work in a couple of days so
we that was only time that we are all
going to be together so we had a little
birthday meal and very very lovely day
still feeling so excited about Sophie's
big question earlier I mean to be one of
her bridesmaids I feel so so very lucky
um yeah we're home now it feels like
it's been quite an exhausting day i
napped most of the car journey home so
I'm going to go and enjoy a nice long
exfoliating fake tanning pampering
session now so I'll see you guys as she
I won't see you tomorrow because
basically Charlie and I are going to
whip table but we're actually going as
part of a collaboration which means I
basically have to send the videos to the
brand for approval before I publish it
so what I might do is try and film a
skincare routine while I'm out there
because a lot of you have been asking
about my skincare routine recently so
I'll probably film that if the hotel has
a nice photogenic bathroom so hopefully
there won't be a big gap tomorrow
we'll see either way can you print a
blank you little Dicky bow either way I
really hope you enjoyed today's vlog my
two chaps are playing with each other
kissing each other and yeah I will see
