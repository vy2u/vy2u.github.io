Cotswolds vlog I know Charlie and I were
only here last weekend but we just can't
can't get enough of it so Charlie now
has escaped from the city and one more
time and we are now in a place called
Lois slaughter and slaughter I would say
it's pretty much the pinnacle of the
Cotswolds it's just so beautiful we're
gonna go for a walk in a second so I'll
show you around
so if you can hear a noise in the
background just extras currently making
himself very at home as you can see that
your bed decks where are mommy and
daddy's leaving then Rooney so we have
Dexter with us as you can see we've
actually chosen a couple of hotels which
are dog friendly you were staying here
for two nights and two hotels for the
trip so one note in each hotel obviously
it's night we're at a place called the
slaughters Country Inn and I'll give you
a little not even a room tour a quarter
to always staying in one of the cottages
I think the main hub is not dog friendly
or the main rooms in the house and not
dog friendly but the cottages are so
this is our room it's absolutely
gianormous as you can see got the bed at
the back then this beautiful big living
area think sofas got a TV behind me we
even have our own garden out here so if
you're looking for somewhere in the UK
that's dog friendly this is absolute
perfect and then I will take you through
to our bathroom it really is like a
whole cottage so this was a little
entrance area and then the bathroom big
bright and marble I might start behind
this shower and marble sink area see how
we're just done packing our stuff not
the really unpacking that much as we're
just here for one nights but we're just
settling in and giving decks with some
food and then we're going to go and
explore the village
so it's a few hours later I didn't
really do much chatty vlogging on our
walk because it's a very peaceful very
difficult cut salty village and I would
have looked like there's a bit of a
Torres devided walked out my camera and
started vlogging but as you saw just
such a beautiful village we're actually
in lower slaughter I think I thought
that we were going to another sort of at
lower slaughter is the village and upper
slaughter is about 15 minute drive up
the road if that maybe it's a 15 minute
walk very very close and our two twin
villages and I actually did a little bit
of research earlier turns out that the
word slaughter is actually an old
English word and has nothing to do with
killing animals range is wonderful but I
always thought was ever a grim name but
turns out it's nothing to do with that
so there's your fun fact of the day it's
like that old english word SL o h TR e o
and it means muddy village or muddy
towns are you hinting for me to talk
about yeah so it means muddy town which
i guess is just like the old english
description of this village it's not
very muddy anymore it's all paved over
obviously and in my fact-checking what
else oh I found out there's another
interesting fact so yes that none of the
buildings have been modified since 1906
no building there has been no building
since 1906 sorry darling got to get my
facts right yeah so that was quite
obviously when we were walking around
the town and Dexter had a really good
time didn't - you looked at lots of
people yeah try to scare not do a very
good job and Dexter is already feeling
very nervous he knows we're going out
for dinner so
starting to get a bit nervous on the bit
so we're gonna leave Dexter in our room
we're actually having dinner here at the
inn tonight here at the end because the
menu is really really nice at lunchtime
and we thought why bother going anywhere
else I will give you a quick outfit of
the day and then we'll head out so this
is probably the best way for me to do it
I'm just wearing this blue and white
striped top which you may have seen in
my Oxford Street haul I got from Zara
and then white jeans these are from H&amp;amp;M
and my shoes which you saw in my outfit
today earlier these are from a website
called Daniel footwear I will link to
everything down below if I can so yeah
what are you wearing going you're
wearing inter-service yeah so super dry
yes super dressy a dress otherwise super
dry nudie jeans name a sauce and a sauce
shoes very nice my short projects which
I want to try and try to strapped to my
what are you wearing have you made
yourself at home I'm wearing dachshund
I'm wearing the finest fur the finest
firm mummy I don't want to talk to you
because I know that you're not taking me
to dinner with you rude so Chaz and I
are going to head out for dinner I'm
hoping that they also have sticky toffee
pudding on the dinner menu cuz I had it
on the lunch menu which I did let me
have it for lunch so let's go
so back in the room now as you saw we've
got lots and lots of kisses from little
Dexter they'd only gone for an hour and
a half you just thought we'd been gone
for a whole year based on how much of an
overreaction we got we came back in so
yeah we had dinner in the main
restaurant here at sorters Country Inn
and it was amazing honestly could have
been Michelin star foods delicious and
feeling it very very full now especially
after did you talk your pudding that
kind of finished me off so we are gonna
get in bed now I've got my lovely
misguided pajamas on Olivia van who
shall Olivia found something mega dupes
of those expensive pajamas and look who
I've got waiting for me in bed this is a
sausage but unfortunately a little boy
doesn't know that he's not going to be
sleeping in bed with us we've got his
bed over behind the sofa so I'm sure
he'll I'm sure he'll have something to
say about that anyway we're gonna get
into bed now so I shall see you it's
bright and early in the morning all
right
say good night Rooney good morning it is
Tuesday it's Tuesday it's Tuesday
feels like the weekend and we've just
woken up I actually just filmed this
makeup look in the camera in the camera
obviously in the bathroom thought I
would do a get ready with me on the go
type video so you may have already seen
it you may still have it look forward to
it either way and Charlie I just about
to go and grab some breakfast and it is
half

we're going to go and see what the
breakfast is like and
feeling very snugly and just driving
into upper slaughter we're basically
just going to explore the villages and
admire and made the most of beautiful
countryside what's it like to drive
darling yes yes in here and it's the
wish list
Charlie and I have now pulled up at a
pub for the wild rabbits which is in a
village called King um we just had a
little wonder around stow-on-the-wold
which actually we came to last summer
when we stay that door my house comes
logs that but if I did I leave it down
below so yeah I'm just parked up we are
totally in love with this car it's just
so perfect driving around a sunny day
with the roof down could not be more
perfect lovely way to see the Cotswolds
as well yeah we're in a place called
King um we're gonna have a little at
one's around take the extra short walk

rabbits we've now come back to Noah
