today I would share with you my kind of
everyday curly hairstyle I've had a few
requests to do this so I thought I would
share quite a quick video on how I get
this kind of everyday quite natural big
curly hairstyle so before I get started
on the tutorial I'm just going to go
through a few of the products which I
have already used on my hair and a few
products which I'm going to use during
the tutorial so when I wash my hair I
tend to switch up my shampoo and
conditioner quite a lot because I don't
like my hair to get too used to a
particular brand and some of my
favorites include child Worthington John
Frieda or urology but as I said I switch
it up all the time when I get out of the
shower however my routine is normally
quite similar I'm a big fan of oils and
there are two that I've been loving at
the moment firstly as soon as I finished
kind of towel drying my hair I'll apply
this one which is the Cara stars elixir
all-team and it's quite a light oil
sells freitas all over my hair and this
will really help to detangle and then
I'll apply the Red King Diamond oil
which is a little bit thicker but still
not at all heavy just to the ends and
again this really helps me with
detangling combing it through and
stopping any flyaways normally I'll let
my hair air dry about 50% of the way so
it's just damp but starting to get a
little bit drier and then I will put
some of this in all of my hair pretty
much from there downwards and this is
the pillow proof blow-dry Express
treatment primer from red camp and I
find that this not only protects my hair
but means that my blow dries and have
any flyaways and just keeps it looking
glossy for longer so I'll put maybe a
pump of this throughout the mid to ends
of my hair and then blow-dry and at the
moment my hair dryer is dgh deep Ora I
believe it's called and I'll usually use
a round barrel brush
Oh John my hat when it comes to curling
my tool that I used my everyday curls is
this which is the GHD curve it's quite a
new addition to my hair tool routine but
I found that since only this I've been
curling my hair a lot more regularly
just because I really like the way the
curls come out and I find it reasonably
easy to use as well as the color I'm
also using a hairdressers clip before
separating my hair and then also my hair
brush which is this really light wooden
paddle brush by evader and this is
sounds really tragic but I don't get
I'll make a known uses hair brush just
cuz it really is so light so these the
tools that are used for creating the
curls and the final two products that I
use are this one which is the Charles
Burlington volume and bounce perfect
finish hairspray and this I used to set
the curls before I run my fingers
through them and it just gives a lovely
slight bit of shine but really good hold
and I really like the packaging this is
the backdoor edition one and I find that
this one doesn't leave my hair sticky
and I can brush it out when I want to
and finally I used the definition mist
by dabbing hairs which is really good
for kind of separating out the hair so
you don't get any fluffiness and it just
creates really defined lovely curls and
it's almost a little bit drying as well
so it gives you almost that second day
hair look so without further ado let's
start this hair tutorial the first thing
I do is brush my hair using my Aveda
hair brush and then just grab that top
section probably about 2/3 of my hair
and really get that out of the way with
my hairdressers clip
having a bit that's quite big so I get
nice big curls and then use the barrel
part of my PhD curve to just clip it at
the end roll it all the way up making
sure the hair is nice and evenly
covering the barrel and then I'm undoing
it after holding it for about 10 seconds
and just letting that curl drop I'm not
going to separate it out just yet
letting it cool down and you can see
that this time I'm curling it towards my
face whereas before I curled it away
from my face so this just gives it a bit
variation between the curls living that
drop out naturally and you can see it's
just giving a very nice natural curl you
know continue doing this all around my
head for this bottom layer the good
thing about the THD curve is you can
just grab hold at the top and it doesn't
burn your hands so it's a really nice
way of having a little bit more control
and then I'm just alternating with the
way that I twist it to give a little bit
of variation to the curls holding this
one while it cools down and you can see
it creates a bigger curl just speed this
up a little bit it's all the same
holding it in place for about 10 seconds
only a drop and then this one because
it's by my face I'm curling it in the
direction that the curl will go away
from my face which I find just looks a
little bit better it also helps to keep
your hair out of your face so you can
see that that's curling really nicely
away from my face and then I pulled down
the next third of my hair and I'm just
going to whiz through this it's all the
same color for my my face for that first
bit
and then towards my face just
alternating them each time holding in
place of ten seconds and the GHD curve
just really gives nice big curls
towards bottom of my hair if I was to
hold it a bit longer it was great curls
that go up a little bit higher if you
did want really big curls then you could
probably just pin the curls in place
using a hairdresser split but for my
everyday look I don't usually do that so
I've just got the last bit of hair down
now and I'm finishing the look with my
child's wearing some hairspray this just
meets
make sure the curls are some face all
day long and then I'm running through it
with my fingers to give a natural finish
I'm just combing it through and then I'm
using the double nose separating spray
just to give it an even more natural
look before brushing through so this is
it the finished look as you can see I've
got quite natural but still nice big
curls I have run my fingers through them
a few times I've just given them quite a
natural look and finish and those sprays
that I use really help to define the
curls and keep that natural shine if on
the occasion I do on a little bit more
shine it then I just add a little bit
more of the red can Diamond toil which I
told you about the beginning just a
teeny tiny amount I'll rub it between my
hands and just pull it through the ends
sometimes our camera in the curls drop a
little bit but it just adds a lovely bit
of shine I think I'm
today with shininess I'm not going to
add any in today but I really hope you
