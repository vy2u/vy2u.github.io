a super week I have been trying loads
and loads of new beauty products this
week and I've kind of got a new everyday
beauty routine thanks to a few things
which I've been trying out and loving
few things in here are things I've been
using since last month things which you
might have seen in my April favorites
video but there's a few new things in
here so I thought now would be a good
time to share my updated everyday makeup
routine
I say updated I've never done an
everyday makeup routine before but it's
updated for me he thinks before I start
obviously the next thing you're gonna
see isn't me without makeup on so my
first time getting makeup free in front
of the camera prepare yourself for that
hopefully it's not too scary and also my
neighbour his fire alarm keeps going off
so if you can hear some like weird
beeping in the background then that's
probably what it is
okay so without further ado here is my
everyday makeup routine okay so the
first thing I'm gonna do is tie my hair
back there is nothing less I'm getting
hair in your face and then I'm applying
the Dalila underwear primer this is
something that I've been trying out
recently it's a really really pretty
bottle it's got the phrase gold lid just
smoothing it all over my face blending
it in not rubbing it too much taking it
down my neck and everything and then
next up is a foundation so I'm gonna use
the Laura Mercier silk crown oil free
photo edition foundation longest name
ever and I'm just putting a few bits on
my cheeks and on my forehead on my chin
just a few splotches and then using the
Bobbi Brown full-coverage face brush to
blend in
you can use this one we got fingers as
well but I just think a face brush gives
more of a flawless the most airbrush
effect so I definitely prefer using a
brush to blend in my foundation
give me a good old buff under the eyes
of the chin just making sure it's all go
into there no lights anywhere taking it
up over my eyebrows that's as much about
anyway and then I'm gonna grab the by
Terri terribly dense earnest I think
that's how you pronounce it concealer
and it's apparently anti-wrinkle and
good for dark circles and I definitely
need all of that because my dark circles
are crazy and this stuff is pretty
powerful and completely eyed them but it
does a pretty good job I make these like
these under my eyes because I find that
it gives me more of more like a flawless
finish burning fires just to cover up
the eye bags and it smoothes it more
into my face so I've had it in with my
fingers and then I go back with a Bobbi
Brown full coverage face brush to really
blend it in and make sure it's kind of
seamlessly blending into my foundation
just give me my eyebrows a bit of a
tweak
they are looking a little bit cray-cray
so I'm using my Anastasia Beverly Hills
brow brush just to comb them and then
I'm going in with the bronzer so I'm
using Bobbi Brown's bronzing powder in
the shade medium now I always tend to go
on my cheekbones first because it kind
of creates a bit of contouring but as
it's everyday makeup you don't want to
be going to consult crazy so I used the
big Bobbi Brown bronzing brush to mainly
just kind of smooth it everywhere
bringing a life into my face cuz it is
so pale otherwise I really just put it
everywhere that the Sun would hit my
face so mainly on the forehead I'll
never get down my cheeks down my nose
and then I tend to go back over the
cheekbones just to give a little bit
more kind of contour finish
sometimes I do this before the bronzer
but I think I forgot this time so I'm
going with the oven decay naked loose
finished powder I think it's cool and
the zoeva powder brush just to set
everything down especially in the under
eye area and then eyeshadow wise I'm
using my new to face of natural eyes
palette and I'm going to be using the
shade newly which is the bottom left one
all over the lid and then push up for a
little bit of crease action and push up
Scott a little bit of shimmer in it so
it's really pretty shade looky how happy
I am I'm using the zoeva luxe petit
crease number two three one two just go
over the crease as well and I'm using
the shade cashmere bunny to do this it
just gives a little bit more definition
to the eyes makes them pop a little bit
and then the pixie brow palette and I
use the second to lighter shade just to
fill in my brows I think using a shadow
on the brows is probably one of the more
natural looks for me sometimes I use a
pencil but today I was just burn our
brow color and the pixie they've got
loads of different shades I'm definitely
not going to use all the darker shades
so someone is going to get a nice little
donation from me when I finished using
up all the lighter shades going in with
the other brow and then I'm gonna use
the benefit gimme brow to just kind of
pull them all together give them a bit
more of a better shape and also it's
quad bit of color in there as well so it
really just brings a whole look
different
and then I'm using my tweezer Minh
lovely pretty is called eyelash curlers
to give my lashes a bit of curl before I
go in with mascara and I'm using the
benefit roller lash mascara on my lashes
I really really love this mascara I love
the packaging I know it separates my
lashes it builds a lot but still quite a
natural way who likes a mascara base and
then one of the last steps is the
benefit Posie bar it's just a really
nice like natural color it's not as high
maintenance to the lipstick but it stops
me from having foundation lips and
that's it that's the final look easy as
that that took me a while to be a little
bit longer than five minutes but yep
that's it
head down and so that's it guys that is
my everyday kind of minimal makeup
routine I tend to switch around the
actual products as in the brands for
example I might use different under-eye
cream or I might use a different lip
balm but that's pretty much the routine
that I go through every morning the
foundation although I've been telling to
switch up to something a little bit
lighter now that it's getting into
summer and I'll always kind of give it a
spray with some kind of mist at the end
of it just to make it a little bit more
dewy and they also have a spray on my
desk at work and just always have a
little one in my handbag just to refresh
every now and then but anyway I really
hope you've enjoyed this video please
