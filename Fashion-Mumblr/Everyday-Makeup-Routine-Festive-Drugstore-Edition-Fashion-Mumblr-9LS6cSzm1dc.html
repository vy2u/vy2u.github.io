now hi guys I hope you're well today's
video is going to be my everyday
drugstore makeup routine I'm gonna make
this intro super quick because not only
is the Sun coming out just when I don't
want it to but I'm also very aware that
I look rather pale and disgusting at the
moment I have not seen the Sun Shine off
from now typically in a very long time
need to get my fake tan act on and also
starting to feel a little bit poorly so
let's put some makeup on this as soon as
possible so today's video is in place of
vlogmas because yesterday i probably
only picked up the camera a grand total
of three times because i was super busy
but i have decided to put yesterday and
today all in one vlog which you'll see
tomorrow so hope you guys don't mind
thought I'd show you my everyday makeup
routine instead of the vlogmas tonight
umm because I haven't done a makeup
routine video in quite some time kind of
just felt it felt it I kind of just felt
like doing one so yeah let's just do
this I'm gonna be using drugstore
products I've been really liking quite a
wide selection of drugstore things
recently and I figured I might as well
make this whole video drugstore because
then everybody can do it no matter what
the budget obviously not all of these
products I will put on my face if I'm
just spending the day at home normally
I'll just slap on some foundation or
tinted moisturizer maybe a bit of brows
but a bomb may be a bit bronzer depends
how snazzy I'm feeling but the makeup
look that I'm going to do is say for
example if I'm going into town if I've
got some meetings but not a full-on
event so yeah let's get cracking sorry
about my voice as well I know that my
nose is about to become blocked the cold
is on its way I'm trying to fight it
I've got eucalyptus burning over there
I'm gonna take a lemon soup when this
video is done I cannot have a cold
because that would make me unproductive
guys know how much I hate being
unproductive so I'm starting by popping
some Rimmel fix and perfect primer on it
smoothes resurfaces brightens mattifies
and I was going to read the French side
thinking it was more but yeah that's
what this does and I really like the
texture of it I find that it makes my
makeup last for a good length of time so
I just slapped a bit of that arm nothing
too precise just put it on with my
fingers make sure all my oily areas get
covered at my forehead and chin I
actually want to tie my hair up but I
will look like a scary old man if I do
that so I'm gonna put these on instead
it's a festive video after all yes I'm
really sorry about the lighting but the
Sun has just decided to come out just
and I don't want it to so yeah we're
just gonna let it do its thing and maybe
if I move hold on I'm gonna move
something okay hopefully that's a little
bit better so the first thing I'm going
to do after applying my primer is
foundation and recently I've been trying
out this one which is a new one from
Bourjois
it's their City radiance the French so
God wants with me in the French this
morning city radiance skin protecting
foundation with brightening effect
anti-pollution SPF 30 radiance boosting
pigments so pretty much has everything
that I'm looking for in a foundation
right now not too bothered about the SPF
30 but better to be safe than sorry
but I really like the whole
anti-pollution thing I find that living
in London at my skin it just gets a
little bit gross and blackheads are
definitely a problem when you live in a
city and this just I guess helps to keep
all the grime and what are they called
free radicals something like that helps
to keep them out so I just dot that on
and then use my Weaver blending brush
just spread that all out hope you guys
like my jumper by the way it's from ASOS
and it's kind of cream plain with little
Christmas trees and then a big Christmas
tree I really like it I'm not too
precise when I put the foundation on
just buff it all over bring it down
chill a little bit
just sign me the tight paper hopefully
you can see it a little bit better
lighting is still not ideal but we're
gonna roll with it and I'm aware that my
eyes are so puffy right now but um yeah
that's what happens in winter so to try
and combat said puffiness I'm going to
pop on some of this which is the
collection lasting perfection ultimate
wear concealer and I'm basically gonna
slap this all over the under-eye area
are gonna be quite what's the opposite
frugal heavy yeah he's going for it I'm
gonna make a rough V under the eyes just
like almost like an upside down to
Christmas tree and no Evers left just
right yeah nothing too precise as you
can see and I'm going to use my finger
to blend this in to start with and I
also take it onto my eyelid as well
because it just helps to create a bit of
a base for my eyeshadow and then I'm
using the same brush I used to my
foundation just to Pat it in to really
blend it with my foundation the
puffiness is still there but hopefully
the color just looks a little bit better
now at least it doesn't my mirror but I
still look equally as pale and puffy in
the viewfinder I hate it when what you
see on the viewfinder is completely
different door I see in the mirror
because I didn't look this bad right now
I fine okay so once that's all blended
I'm going to be using one of the Rimmel
hide the blemish concealers just on a
couple of blemishes that I've got I know
it's a little bit unhygenic but I always
just use my finger my fingers usually
clean I usually only going once anyway
and just dab that on to that lovely spot
which I've got on my upper lip don't
know where that came from
but I just find this concealer in
particular I think it's like 10 years
now this is for now they just celebrated
some kind of anniversary doesn't say but
yeah Rim will hide the blemish I just
find it's a really nice consistency
cheapest chips I think like three pounds
um and it blends really well vanished
spot isn't no more and then because I
absolutely hate foundation lips I'm
going to be using the Rimmel Kate Moss
lip balm
got a specific name of them just the
Kate lip balm but yeah I really like
this one very playing lip balm and it
just kind of helps to prepare my lips
and not only repair them because they do
get a bit dry winter so I finished
before I carry on talking so that's
quite hard to multi does so I put on the
Kate Rimmel lip balm next it just helps
to nourish my lips a little bit
I hate foundation that's anyway and it
just helps to make sure my lips aren't
too dry before I go in with my lip
crayon a little bit later on just blend
this in so that my lips aren't looking
too hey Oaks I really don't like that
look I'm fully aware that the Bronx they
were about to use is not the drugstore
product but I could not find my own
bourgeois chocolate foundation
foundation I could not find my bourgeois
chocolates and bronzer I think it's in
my gym bag and who knows why my gym I
guess cuz I have not seen that vibe
going quite a long time but I do find
the bourgeois is incredibly similar
color wise to the Estee Lauder so I just
Pat that on to your bronzing brush and
use the figure of three forehead cheeks
chin my face always looks a little bit
more alive once I've got some bronzer on
I'm blending it down my neck as well
just because my neck it's also super
duper pale at the moment I'm gonna make
sure that's already well blended in in
my mirror here I actually look quite
matte but in the viewfinder again I look
pale and shiny so it's not that I
promise when I do my makeup the order
always varies on what I think is looking
the worst so right now I'd say that the
eyebrows are what's bothering me so
that's what I'm gonna do next I'm
absolutely loving eyebrow pencils at the
moment my favorite drugstore and I would
say is so enjoy archery I have run out
of that so I know I said that that was
the only non drugstore but I'm gonna use
the Urban Decay brow beta honestly so
from Glory archery pencil is just as
good and if I had not used it all up
I'd be using it right now but yeah I
promise promise this time this is the
last non drugstore so Urban Decay for
albita I just color it in the very empty
patches of my eyebrows just using really
light strokes I have always really
struggled with patching us here in my
eyebrows so you guys know of anything
that actually works to bring the brow
hair back please let me know because I
am dying to have bushy brows in 2016 but
yeah nothing seems to be working for me
right now
so I don't we straight to much from my
natural brow shape I'm more just use
this to fill in the gaps and then I'll
use the brush on the other end just to
brush them through which I think kind of
blends the color in a bit better stops
it from looking too penciled and a bit
more natural
my eyebrows are never gonna be identical
so I just don't really bother trying to
make them look identical they are
sisters not twins after all and then I'm
using the Ilia brow amplifier which is a
little bit like benefit gimme brow
you've got this cute little brush and I
find that this not only sets them in
place and kind of puts the hairs in the
position I want them to be in but also
makes them look a little bit more bushy
but bushy also makes them look a little
more bushy as well especially if you
kind of backcomb them which I'll try and
show you basically just wiggling the
brush in the brows it just helps to kind
of same effect as when you're back
combing your hair just gives a little
more volume to the brows I was actually
taught this by the girls at benefit that
works with other products too
okay brows looking a little bit better
now I'm going to go in with some eye
shadow and for that I'm going to use an
eye shadow quad from Bourjois this one
is their smoky stories quad and I don't
really like the shimmer shade in the
middle it's okay for here but normally
for an everyday look I don't like the
brush either so I'll just Chuck that out
but these three shades are really really
like really good for an everyday look so
I'm going to take one of my Too Faced
makeup brushes and start with the
lighter brown shade it's very crumbly
that's all I'd say about this so
definitely tap it off and then I'm not
going to be too precise because this is
just an everyday look but gonna swipe
that all over my eyelids and I really
bring it up quite close to the brow bone
as well because it is such a light color
you can get away with that back in for a
bit more and it has got a little bit of
shimmer in it as well so if you do like
your eyes to have shimmer but not
Sparkle then this is a really good one
for that it's it's almost pearlized but
not too obvious it's still very subtle I
think if you build it up on the actual
lid it starts to get a little bit more
pearly which can look really really
pretty and then shuffle in a bit more
spent than you guys can really see this
okay you can really see the eye bags now
but at least you can actually see what
I'm doing on my eyes so again
lightest color just gonna build it up a
little bit more and then using the same
brush I'm just going to go in with a
slightly darker shade just get a little
bit on there tap it off and I'm going to
use this in the crease and they're
really lovely and blendable so you don't
need to worry if you're not pro at doing
an eye makeup I certainly am NOT but
just gonna lightly bring this into the
crease just to bring in a little more
definition if you're not sure how to do
makeup in the crease I'm not a pro but
what I do is I keep my eye open and
starting at the edge just follow the
circle of the eye the semicircle is how
you'd say just basically follow the
crease of the eyelid
just like this and then you can blend it
out afterwards probably got a little bit
heavy on that for it every day but we'll
just make the other one even and then
see what we can do with it and then I'm
going to use a clean brush this is
another old two-faced blending brush
just to blend the two colors in together
to make this a little bit softer and
finally I'm just going to use the brush
which I use the blending just a teeny
teeny tiny bit on the pink and dot that
in the middle just to make myself look a
little bit more awake really so this is
a finished eye shadow look really really
easy to use with the port or our pallet
nothing too precise or expertise needed
there and it's given kind of still brown
but almost like a brown gray silver look
which is quite nice for winter then
because I don't want to look too ill I'm
gonna be using a L'Oreal what's this
called super liner perfect slim in brown
just to add a very skinny line it's a
lovely super skinny pencil just to the
eyelash line
and just teeny tiniest of Catholics to
make my eyes look a tiny bit wider and I
also learned a new trick when I went to
the Tom Ford makeup counter I never used
to do this before maybe everybody else
in the world does but just to bring it
and went into this area here and it
really does widen the eyes so I'm gonna
try and do that now so you're almost
going on the waterline but try not to
poke yourself in the eye so while this
is a brown liner I find it's very dark
brown so you still ready get the
different mission definition you still
get the definition without it being
quite so harsh as a black liner but even
though this is a super cheap liner from
L'Oreal it's probably one of my favorite
liners to use I love that it's brown and
not black it's just less harsh than the
black and I really like the pen itself
it's quite soft so you can see it kind
of bends quite easily color comes out
really intense so you don't need to sit
there scribbling it's soft
I just can't refill this and the lasting
power I'd say lasts all day and I don't
need to top it up and yeah it's just a
really gentle easy to use liner I'm not
going to be precise at all here really
and finally I'm gonna put on some
mascara going to curl my lashes with my
tweezer Monroes gold lash curlers and
then I'm going to use this which is the
L'Oreal feline million volume volume
million lashes mascara so just a quick
squeeze on the curlers
and this one's got a really lovely brush
it's very um it's very similar to roller
lash in fact this little bit fatter you
can see it's got that scoop detail so
you can have the oh can you see it I'll
do a close-up but it's got the very long
bristles on the bottom side and short
ones on the underside so you can really
get into the lashes and then separate
them out with the longer side so perfect
brush really really good drugstore
mascara I think it's great for combing
the lashes and really catching every
single one I normally start with the
under side to really wiggle it and then
I flip it round and comb them through
with the side where the bristles are
really long
I'm not gonna put any on the bottom
lashes today just because I look too
tired as it is performance go her face
looking so when I've done the second eye
I'll always go back into the first day
using the longer bristle side to even
more comb them through and fan them out
a little bit as well as adding a little
bit more scar to add a bit more volume
I've been getting really into false
lashes recently obviously for an
everyday look I don't use them so it
means I just put a little bit heavier on
the sky than maybe out used to we don't
to go too crazy so I'm going to stop
that so next I'm going to pop on some
blusher and I am in love with my
Charlotte Tilbury one at the moment but
just that you guys are going to be using
the hmmm blush in deep brown which is
very very similar to the middle shade of
the Charlotte Tilbury so I've been
really liking this one my Bobbi Brown
blusher brush but um just use whichever
blusher brush you have and I'm just
gonna pop that on the apples of the
cheeks nothing too much I don't really
want to go to blush heavy with this this
makes it a little bit prettier nothing
too precise just make sure it's nicely
blended and finally for the lips there
are two products which I absolutely
absolutely absolutely love at the moment
and I've probably mentioned these many
times before Rimmel exaggerate lip liner
and this is in the shade liar I believe
net exaggerate so I start by lining the
lips with this as I said if I am just
working from home I'll just stick a balm
on but um I'm home on but if I am going
out that I'll always do this bit so just
lining the lips but this I never go
outside my natural lip line
so do you quite like my lips natural
shape
and then I fill the lipst in with one of
two things recently I've been obsessed
with the Topshop lip crown in the shade
Motel but that is in the depths of my
handbag at the moment so I'm gonna be
using the other one which I've been
loving which is the Rimmel color burst
Revlon boobs revlon colorburst in the
shade 2 to 5 sultry salut salut use 2 to
5 and this is a very similar shape to
Topshop maybe a little bit more bearish
so easy to apply and that's pretty much
it SuperDuper easy I really like the
shape of the applicator on this so it is
literally just like a giant Crayola
pencil but because it does go into that
quite sharp ish nib I find you can get
into the corners of your mouth a lot
more not more easily than the Topshop
one which is more of a traditional
lipstick shaped bullet but yeah I
sometimes blot this sometimes I don't
depends on how much time I've got on my
hands I think now after I film this I'll
just grab a bit toilet roll classy lady
and blot it just to make it a slightly
more subtle color and so this is pretty
much all I would do for going out in the
daytime now that it's winter slash
slightly festive
sometimes if if I do have some events
that don't require a full-on makeup look
I will use the Rimmel provoker lips lip
lacquer stain and I shave this one which
creates a super duper long-lasting red
lip it's got the lip color staying in
one side and the gloss in another which
is just more moisturizing but this I
would easily compare it to the Chanel
lip stain love this color and if you
really want to go festive with a red lip
but don't want to spend a fortune then I
definitely recommend this one if I am
going out in the evening or if I do or
sound like I'm from Yorkshire or if I
just want to smash things up a little
bit I will use my favorite drugstore
highlighter which is a revolution vivid
baked highlighter my writing honest is
coming off but it looks like this is
beautiful and I use
Real Techniques contour brush dab it in
the middle nothing too precise just
flick that over the cheekbones a few
guys commented on my vlog from yesterday
all the day before at the ice skating
rink and we like what I like to be using
so this is pretty much the finished look
with the highlighter as an extra
addition again as I said you can switch
up for a red lip if you want to make a
little bit more snazzy and if I am going
out into town and I just don't want to
worry about my makeup slipping around I
will use the L'Oreal infallible fixing
mist which I believe is quite new to the
UK I think I've made the so but I think
it was available in the US and it's just
recently launched in the UK either way I
just spritz a couple of them mists of
this onto my face if I'm going out into
town I would say you have to press it
with conviction so the wise it kind of
spits on you so really press it and
it'll be more of a mist does leave your
face a little bit wet so um yeah you
were and so this is it this is the
finished makeup look that the one thing
that I do want to mention that the
finishing is my favorite drugstore
perfume so recently I've been loving
black musk from the body shop
I find it smells so similar to why I
sell black opium and this is my favorite
thing to spritz all over from the high
street which is kind of like everyday
you don't want to be wasting your super
expensive perfumes I'm really really
loved that one so that's the final look
and smell for my festive drugstore
everyday makeup routine as I said you
can switch in a few extra products like
the UM
REM apocalypse or you don't even need to
use a highlight if you don't want to
because some of my argue it's a little
obsessive obsessive excess over for an
everyday makeup look but it's really
easy to switch these kind of things in
and out of your makeup routine and I
really hope you guys have enjoyed this
video please do give it a thumbs up if
