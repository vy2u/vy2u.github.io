hope you guys had a super evening last
night whether you were at home with
friends and family or whether you are
out partying hopefully you're not
feeling too delicate this morning this
is the first time that I've filmed since
Christmas so also hope that you guys had
a magical Christmas and just had a
super-duper festive period whether
you're relaxing or partying I hope
you've made the most of it and yeah had
a great few weeks to kick off the new
year I have got some really really
exciting news which I've kind of been
planning for the past six weeks or so
and I've wanted to tell you about it for
so long I've actually hinted to it in a
few vlogs so you might have picked up on
that but the big news is that my blog
fashion mumbler calm has had an
absolutely gianormous facelift if you
read my blog before you'll have known
that it was a very traditional blog
style it was really gorgeous it was
actually designed by PIP dig in 2014 and
I launched it this very day January the
first on 2015 and I absolutely love that
blog design but for 2016 I just wanted
to go for something completely different
i've been working really hard for the
past six weeks or so and what we've come
up with is just the most beautiful
visual really impactful blog design
which i really really hope you guys will
love over on fashion mumbler calm if you
haven't followed my blog already i'll
leave all the details down below so you
can check it out so the main difference
for me is that I've moved from blogger
to wordpress I was really comfortable
with blogger although i was quite
restricted to what i could make the blog
look like so it always had to be that
very specific design whereas now we've
moved over to wordpress so myself and
the guys at peptic have really been able
to have a lot more freedom with the blog
design you'll notice that it really
doesn't conform to any typical blogger
layout standards it's completely
different it's really interactive and
really really visual so it's going to
take me a little while to get used to
working with WordPress I'm sure but
hopefully you guys will notice a really
big change and you'll love it as much as
I do there's also some really cool new
features on the blog it's really easy to
navigate there's a huge fashion section
where you can see all my outfits you can
even shop my wardrobe
of then there's a beauty section which
is like looking inside my beauty covers
you can see my latest purchases so my
favorite things as well as all the
reviews and beauty looks which I put
together also a huge lifestyle section a
Travel section and a food section so
there's loads and loads of different
categories so whatever you're interested
in I'm sure it will be over on the vlog
another section which I'm really excited
about is my new shop so you'll notice
along the top you can enter a shop area
and then there you can shop with in my
wardrobe what's on my wishlist some
current trends and also during sale
periods i'll be listing my top sales
pics so hopefully you will head over to
the blog and have a little look at that
and let me know what you think and so
before i get started on my news
resolutions i just want to let you guys
know about a giveaway and survey that
i'm running on the blog basically i want
to find out a little bit more about you
whether you just watch my youtube or
whether you also read my blog a little
bit i've made a very quick survey just
wanting to find out a bit about you and
your interests and to say thank you for
your time i'm running a really big
beauty humper giveaway and also some
topshop vouchers just to say thank you
for taking the time to fill out the
survey so I'll leave the links to that
down below and it would mean a lot to me
if you just spend a few minutes just
telling me a little bit about yourselves
in the very quick survey so for my news
resolutions I wanted to keep them really
achievable I didn't want to set anything
that was too out there I just wanted to
be able to really achieve them this year
so you'll notice especially the first
few they're very simple very personal to
me if you're also a blogger or youtuber
maybe some of these might be good ones
for you as well but the first one for me
is just to drink more water I set this
myself every year and previously I've
just not done very well at it I don't
know whether it's just that I find it
too boring or whether I just don't have
water there in front of me but this year
i really want to sit down and drink more
water and make it a real target of mine
this new little notebook which have got
from kekek actually has a little water
tally down at the bottom so hopefully
that might help me on my mission to
drink at least eight glasses of water
this year this year more like everyday I
need to drink eight girls in the water
every day every time I have a problem
with my skin whether it's congested
pools or under eye bags I always kind of
know that the solution is to drink more
water yet for some reason I don't but
this year I really really want to just
drink at least eight glasses of water
every day and hopefully that will make a
big difference to my skin my hair my
nails my eyes everything so fingers
crossed I'm going to try really really
hard to stick to that one my second one
is to stick to a schedule as you guys
know I work from home so that means that
sometimes it can be quite easy to
procrastinate or do things I shouldn't
be doing but I'd love to set myself a
schedule so for example mondays are
working from home admin days tuesdays
and wednesdays on meetings in town
thursdays and fridays working from home
ID I want to have more time working from
homes that can be really productive and
take lots of beautiful photos and take
some really great videos for you guys
and really limit my time going into town
there's so many meetings and events I
could be going to but I'm more
productive at home so if I stick to a
schedule hopefully that will mean that's
unable to be a lot more productive I'm
the same what kind of tracks I want to
keep myself ahead whether it's blog
content or YouTube content by one week I
know it doesn't sound like a lot and
previously before i started doing
youtube i was able to keep my blog
scheduled a week in advance but at the
moment it's some just one day in advance
but i really want to get myself more
organized i'm using this little period
between christmas and new year to get
myself ahead and I'd love to maintain a
one-week schedule for the rest of the
year so wish me luck for that one my
fourth New Year's resolution is to go to
the gym at least twice a week now that
i'm working from home i really don't
have any excuse yes i take dexter for
long walks but i'd love to be able to
tell myself that yes I've managed to go
to the gym twice a week I do find it
quite hard to motivate myself to go to
the gym I've never been a huge huge
Fitness person although I do find it
quite addictive once I start to notice
any changes in my body so this year
there's a few gyms near me that I really
should just go to on a much more regular
basis so twice a week i think is quite
achievable and yeah i'm going to try
really really hard to stick to that one
as well my next one i'm sure a lot of
people might be saying this as well for
new year's resolutions but it's to stop
procrastinating i find it so easy to
just pick up my phone and spend 10 15 20
minutes checking through instagram or
through twitter when really I should be
doing something more productive
I'm not sure how to train myself out of
this if you guys have got any tips and
let me know but stopping it
procrastinating will be really really
good for my productivity levels so
that's something very high on my agenda
for 2016 my next one is to create weekly
meal plans so Charlie and I we tend to
just eat whatever we feel like in the
evenings which is not healthy and not
terribly good for our budget either so
if we come together and just really
think about what we want to eat for the
rest of the week then we can buy food
accordingly and hopefully be more
healthy and just be more efficient with
what we buy as well so creating meal
plans is another resolution I also want
to make sure that I'm cleansing
thoroughly every evening as a beauty
vlogger you'd think that I'd do that
anyway but actually I get really tired
very suddenly in the evenings this and
I'm just like no I'll just use a
micellar water and even sometimes the
face vibe which I know is not enough to
really cleanse the skin so 4 2016 my
resolution is to use proper double
cleansing routine every evening so
taking the bulk off within my civil
water and then using a cleansing oil or
cleansing foam or cleansing balm
anything just to really deep cleanser
skin that before I go to bed and I think
that I'll make quite a big difference to
my skin I also want to give more to
charity this year whether that's my time
or money or donating things I just think
that it's really important there's so
much going on in the world that we can't
necessarily do a lot about but I think
if you start as Michael Jackson said
start with a man in the world I'm sure I
can donate some time whether that's
helping out in a charity shop or
donating some clothes I just want to
make sure that every month I do
something for charity because every
little really does help and 4 2016 I
definitely want to travel more we've got
a few trips lined up which been really
exciting some quite big trips are
actually going to Australia and summer
so I think that's a good one to get this
resolution kick-started but I just want
to say yes to more opportunities and get
see more of the world because the world
is incredible place and this I've always
loved traveling and yeah hopefully this
year we'll see a little bit more of it
so definitely want to travel a little
bit more this year and finally I want to
learn to switch off so another thing
that
comes with working from home being your
own boss means sometimes it's quite hard
to just say okay I'm done now I'm going
to shut my laptop down and relax I
definitely struggle with that so I think
this year I'm going to set myself
perhaps a 7 p.m. deadline and after that
all my work stuff just go to my office
and I shut the door yes I'm ready still
check Twitter or Instagram every now and
then I think it's really important to
have more time with Charlie with my
family and just learn to have some
evenings and weekends to myself so
switching off won't be easy it's going
to take some training to get myself into
their habit but that's definitely a
really important resolution for this
year so they're my resolutions as you
can see they're pretty achievable
hopefully they're nothing too crazy to
out there I'm not going to try and learn
new language or learn to handstand walk
or anything crazy and some more don't
even know but there's bit yeah pretty
down-to-earth and hopefully achievable
resolutions for 2016 I'd love to know
what you guys are choosing for your news
resolutions let me know in the comments
below what you think of mine if you
think but any are too crazy or if you're
going to do any of these things for your
resolutions as well and let me know and
yeah I really hope you guys will head
over to my blog now and have a little
look around hopefully get a feel of the
new layout I know it's completely
different to anything you guys have seen
before it's really and different as far
as a blog goes but hopefully you'll get
used to it and you'll love it as much as
I do so thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you're having a very
chilled day if you had a little bit of a
party last night for New Year and I'll
see you very soon bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
