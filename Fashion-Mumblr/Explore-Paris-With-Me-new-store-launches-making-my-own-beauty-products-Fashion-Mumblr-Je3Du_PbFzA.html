board my flight to Paris they work up
nice knowing this morning had our final
meal at Armitage and got a collar span
our drive to me it was so much traffic
so I was panicking a little bit but made
it on time yeah thanks parents today not
going home and going to spend a couple
days in Paris with Birchbox so you guys
will see everything we get up soon
you're like such little Jets hopeful at
the moment not even going home to
interest I don't know how these travel
bloggers do it that are literally not
even home I feel like this is exhausting
enough and yeah it's jet Charmian form
because my suitcase was way over the
weight anyway and that's why
okay so we have arrived in Paris and
I've just checked in to my room at the
hotel of Bashan loft which is so funny
because you may recognize views
surroundings it's actually where I
stayed last time I was in Paris so it
feels like coming home which is really
nice it's such a beautiful hotel so as I
mentioned I'm here in Paris in search
box because the launching or they just
launched a store here and so excited to
go and look around the Birchbox store in
New York is absolutely amazing so
looking forward to seeing what part one
is all about this is my room so
beautiful lights and I've got a gorgeous
balcony little Juliet balcony looking
over on the courtyard as well also looks
like there's some goodies on the bed so
let's have a look at what time do Josie
welcome to Paris if you have lights and
shopping I hope you'll enjoy your stay
in Paris happy - I'm not sure what that
says happy to meet you food love shop
and love from the Birchbox ranting this
really cute tote bag which is absolutely
my color - the absolute tea and then we
have a little bag from Birchbox so it
looks like spent some time this is the
new box so beautiful let's go to marble
design this is definitely a most
enjoyable vault let's see what's inside
this month okay so we have got a mineral
eyeshadow 50 shades from a brand called
mask not heard of these guys before but
that's why I love about Birchbox lots of
new discoveries and then we have a
minion flick with mascara Punk
volumizing mascara from duche another
one I've actually not tried before this
is microdermabrasion exfoliator from dr.
Brandt that's so handy because I think
foliation every day since I've been away
from deafening to give myself good
little scrubs from that then we have a
mask for brightness and volume for
damaged
hair this is a brand called Qureshi
again this is such a good like discovery
Bach and really good travel size and how
to use that one nature as well and
finally a body cream from a brand called
wish very sleek packaging and all sorted
when post shower pampering later a bit
involved here in the bathroom
authorities possibly one of my favorites
so this I got this in a birch box at
optimum mixed in like a year ago and has
become totally reliant I and especially
the travel side so it's a beautiful
character as a leave-in conditioning
spray of your hair and you can get them
on Birchbox chakra UK I'll leave links
to all these pieces down below but
basically if you have long hair like me
and you travel a lot and you don't take
all your haircare with you but you need
like a spray conditioner so the Alpha
brush your hair is give a savior and
smells so good also amazing for
traveling and very French got a cool new
business turning cubes right now and
lots of other goodies which are we
trying out so for the next day or so
they're already being absolutely spoiled
by Birchbox and Sanford waabri's fun
afternoon ahead I'm just going to spend
a few minutes now unpacking and then
we're meeting downstairs a little bit
later to go and do some exploring with
some of beauty brands of Stockton
Birchbox so yeah I catch you later
just watch my hotel view a little
boutique nearby put a chicken I hope I
said that in the right way and this is a
French brand we're about to discover a
lot about it but basically Birchbox
Booker T K is the only place you can
live in the UK and they also had one of
their products in a recent version and
we're going to cover more about Fran's
travel to Florida audio so alone that
see what it's all about
so students is a natural and organic
poison brand we have just discovered
which we all more excited trial or
products and as I said a second ago they
smell amazing we're about to we'll just
filled out questionnaire about our
preferences and now I think we're even
going to try and making our own so it's
personalized beauty we're going to be
adding potential rules in my view
product based on a kind of analogy like
what kind of results you want an
aphrodisiac straighter and he wants a
purified so they can use the benefit you
want to choose the right essential oils
are products respected so making amends
and laboratory and we're going to make
body proud to not mean fine to fix my I
think it is gadget this is going to make
sure you get is actually yeah
loser in the oil yeah you need to free
and sell explode mmm
oh my god
can you show fat vegan by hand
that's a kind of German occasion and we
made our own natural Beach product he
filled a little magnet making it go
crazy
and now Hannah Ellie and I have just
come to yogurts Factory and we're now
looking for the perfect background get
an HD Instagram because we all about the
grade of note kind of so happy
local through whereas I've gone for
brownie and some stories
the girlies niacin on a successful
shopping trip Anna was on the hunt for a
beautiful handbag which she found Maggie
dying we found their lead you any going
outfit for tonight oh yeah and I will
show you what I got in a second we're
heading back to hotel now we're going to
get ready for dinner so I'm just topping
up my makeup
we are heading out for dinner in maybe
20 minutes or so so I would share with
you a few tips on how to refresh your
makeup we are completely redoing it so I
would definitely say use a cream
foundation over like a powder or any
other kind of consistency just because
it seems to blend really really well
using a big buffing brush like this
definitely helped I showed you this
earlier but myths like this really are
such a lifesaver when it comes to
freshen up your makeup so rip that on
and then do a little bit more buffing I
find that during the day my eye shadow
doesn't necessarily go anywhere and when
it just gets creeped so by using a
really nice big blending brush like this
one you can either to lend your existing
eye shadow help could you put a primer
on earlier today or in just adding
something a little bit darker just
because I've got it here and then
putting a lighter color on the lid
itself will just brighten the eye area
I'm going to freshen up the brows with a
comb on my louisa and my brows or bit
matted today i don't you know how that
happened I think I may be put too much
product on earlier I'm just kind of
brushing that out and then filling in
the gaps again I'm going to add some
eyeliner this is my designer slim line
liner and this will just take my eye
look from day to night and then I'm
going to use my small brush to add a
little bit bronzer from the Too Faced
palette just really as a contour color
- much more color to the majority of my
complexion
and now I'm going to use the
highlighting palette just to touch up
the cheekbones and also under the brow
bone - I'm going to use the little
inscribe that came in the birch box this
one is the duche Punk volumizing Gaara
hopefully it will do it as a tenon to
add volume to my current mascara a nice
tip brush so domestic I'm going to apply
a long-lasting matte lipstick over the
top of what I've already got on and this
one is the rever clear messages on my
favorite
bonsoir
so I must apologize that I didn't
actually talk to the camera that much
this evening
I did show you my outfit and I showed
you a few clips of where we went to
dinner but and just forgot to actually
talked on camera so sorry about that but
the group of six of us so it myself
Ellie and Hannah and then the three
lovely ladies from Birchbox who all and
went out for dinner after taking some
photos outside other bloggers like to do
and we were recommended this restaurant
and it was absolutely fabulous
we all had a solid start we're never fit
a beef with macaroni cheese and yeah I
was delicious and then a pistachio
souffle for dessert and distress your
ice cream which absolute counters I
stupidly have left my little nightie my
little pink pajama outfit I think I must
have left in Montecarlo because it's
nowhere to be found in my case so I'm
just going to sleep in this really soft
t-shirt so shiny and they're really
lovely first day in Paris we're going to
be doing a little bit more exploring
tomorrow we're going to go to the
Birchbox store so I can't wait to share
that with you guys
I'm going to take my makeup off now so I
thought seeing as I haven't chatted much
to a camera today I do a little mini get
unready with me I'm going to start by
taking the bulk off with one of my FC
lauder double wear makeup white sees one
to be honest I just grab these two bring
them with me so I could finish off
packet which I have now done and I do I
do really like them but I mean I don't
really think you need luxury face works
I think simple ones do the job just as
well I found that they have dried out a
little bit as well those packets may be
a few months old but it hasn't really
dried out next I'm going to use my laksa
turn that cleansing oil this is one that
I got in their trouble minute trick
this really love um
so see how this going to smells it's
kind of almondy and it feels really
lovely and soft on my skin get rid of
all the makeup and it's quite fun as
well which is what we like to have when
you're traveling so as you can see that
made my eye makeup go rather scary I've
got this little mini little eye bright
which is one of my favorites because
since oozing you can actually use it
like a pampering treatments for your
eyes and that is also a makeup remover
just hold that in place for a few
seconds and then wipe it away a mist of
my quarterly faceless third use account
for this today and then because I've
been doing a lot of traveling I'm
actually going to put on an overnight
face mask this is a little mini down
there this is the intense revitalizing
mask so I'm just going to put a thick
layer of this long of my night cream
okay so that's me all pampered and ready
for bed so I'm going to spend next maybe
half an hour just finishing off editing
the video that you guys would have seen
yesterday that's my usual routine do a
little bit of editing until I'm too
tired and I just fall asleep going to
also read through the comments from the
vlog that for me went live today which
is my day one in Monaco reply to as many
comments as I can do so thank you so
much to everyone that leaves lovely
comments it really does make my day to
