another daily vlog I know October's out
the way but as I'm doing some quite fun
things for the next ten days to two
weeks or so I thought I would just do a
little bit more daily vlogging and as
you can probably tell I'm not at home
judging from the scenery and the fact
that I'm not wearing very much clothing
I'd probably be freezing to death if I
was wearing this back home I'm actually
in Abu Dhabi and it's my first time here
so I'm really really excited I just
didn't really know what to expect but I
will take you guys along with me so you
can join in all the new experiences with
me so I arrived very early this morning
so currently don't have my watch on but
currently it's about half-past ten Abu
Dhabi time which is about six o'clock in
the morning UK time so feeling actually
not too jet-lagged I'm about to go have
a little nap by the pool - hopefully
combat any jetlag but yeah so we flew
overnight we took off from Heathrow
eight o'clock last night and I flew
Etihad business class which was
absolutely amazing it was one of the
smaller airplanes and I think um the
bigger airplanes are a little bit
fancier business class but even the one
that we flew in on last night was really
really lovely and just made the journey
a whole lot nicer the air staff air
hostesses were just incredible it was
like it was like the service you'd get
at a fancy restaurant it was so nice and
I had like a full course dinner I had
steak I had an Arabian meze for my
starter and then a cheese board so yeah
that journey was pretty darn cool um and
I slept quite a lot of it as well now we
are in the hotel Viceroy this is my room
it's already a bit of a bomb site
because I just wanted to empty my
suitcase and get outside so yeah this is
my room it's absolutely gianormous we've
got like a hidden fridge in there
and there wasn't like tea and coffee
making facilities in that one
what else can I show you without showing
you all the mess and I was only short
pack so I just packed I mean a lot of
stuff there is like a whole huge
wardrobe full of bits and bobs my
suitcase over there still not completely
unpacked and and then this room has like
a kind of open bathroom so the bedroom
that I sleep in is there and then you
kind of like open and shut this little
slider door so it's pretty cool and then
this is the bathroom area really nice
and bright nice marble sink area which
is absolute beautiful as a bath and I
haven't had a proper bath and so long
because our hot water has been so dodgy
so yeah absolutely beautiful room
excuse my face I've obviously not topped
up my makeup since getting off the
flights I just wanted to get outside so
oh that would have been my makeup bag
falling into the sink
hmm I can't actually see yet oh no some
creams falling in the bath oh dear so
I've got the piston allergy on my face
because this one's just really good at
not getting you and spotty do you ever
get like sweat spots on your face well I
definitely don't want to have that so
I'm using that one for my face and then
I'll show you the Sun cream I swear by
especially for like that first day of
holiday when you just you know you don't
really bare your skin because you're
looking more pale but this is when one
it's not sponsored by Brisbane by the
way it's just my fave this is the
instant glow skin illuminating Sun spray
so don't if you can tell but it's giving
me a little bit of a sheen um without
tanning you if that makes sense but yeah
SPF 15 no soft and subtle Gordon shimmer
and it's really good protection and the
smell of it just reminds me of holidays
I don't know why but the smell just
reminds me of like super tropical
holidays like Costa Rica or like
Caribbean or Maldives it's just yeah
such a nice smell so anyway I'm dying to
get outside in the sunshine as you can
tell I'm already pretty red at one more
thing I want to show you so this hotel I
don't know if I mentioned it's the yells
Viceroy I think the island is called yes
because our Dhabi is
to the mainland but also an archipelago
I think I pronounced that right of
different islands and we're on the one
quarry as y-a s and this hotel is built
over and above the Formula one racetrack
which is so cool and the Formula One or
something that my dad was just so so
passionate about it was like the one
thing he'd always go and watch Formula
One on Sky Sports it was always his
thing and so it's just kind of giving me
goosebumps being here seeing the
racetrack like I'll show you the view in
a second we are above the racetrack my
room looks right down onto it and when
we're having breakfast a second ago they
the cars are racing round during
practice laps because the Formula one is
in ten days time and the sound just
echoes through the whole hotel I will
try and catch it on camera for you guys
a little bit later but for now let me
show you this view Wow
so this here the whole hotel is covered
in this kind of structure not sure what
to call it but yeah so this is all the
seating this is the racetrack or a small
part of it and then you've got the
marina over there with all the yachts
so seriously and seriously cool
stuff again pretty noisy out there as
you can hear there's cars hurtling
around and actually we're not too far
from the airport so oops
lighting and so yeah it's fairly noisy
but luckily the rooms when the doors
shut is very soundproof so um yeah I'm
gonna go and show you the pool area and
then do a little bit sunbathing before
this afternoon's activities okay it's a
couple of hours later now and we've been
outside by the pool enjoying a little
bit of sunshine and we've now committed
to one of the many restaurants in this
hotel this is called restaurant origins
and it was reserved only for guests
celebrating Diwali this morning we've
been allowed into the lunch and let me
show you some of the food here because
wow it is pretty spectacular so behind
me this entire thing this entire area is
full of desserts we've got strawberry
tarts gluten-free pasta creme chocolate
white chocolate mousse and experice and
then over here there is an ice cream
station ice cream in subway station look
at this oh my god I'm going to be so
obese at the end of this trip it is
these are all desserts I always come to
the dessert section first just to figure
out how much room I need to leave I am
going to leave a lot of room
okay next on our agenda today I have
changed my outfit because the dress code
upon these long trousers so I'm a dear
to regulation don't worry case you're
thinking Jessie you shoulders so yeah
we're on a boat now as you can see in
the marina which is the marina right by
our hotel so behind me in that direction
that is Viceroy Hotel if you hear in a
background you can hear the Formula one
cars going around the racetrack so I
think we're now just going to have a
little cruise around the bay and
potentially go to a few other hotels
like pull into their little mooring
areas and then I think we're going it to
the promise of the Emirates I think
you
member
okay so I didn't really look at the
raised bar because you want to beam out
here worth it I was saying but we've now
come to the Emirates Palace for dinner
and driving a car driver and this is
already the most opulent made I think
I've ever been I mean the top on the
wall behind me in Verona
in sight let me take you for a little
tool and let you see what I'm saying
okay I take that back insane things I
mean look at this
come on I believe I'm saying this but
this is where we are eating tonight we
have this ginormous long table so for
all of the air to have gang just the
most incredible back may have a look at
this went outside blonder yes yanggeum
anything along trees you've got a
cocktail station over here hotels being
made for us oh my gosh look over here I
wasn't lying early on I said I'm going
to be obese at the end of this trip oh
my gosh dude you know we've just been in
the works for some time right and we're
celebrating our first year partner and
the taste festivals that
eventually
so I just realized I haven't really
explained what's going on or why I'm
here and why there is so much amazing
food everywhere but basically we are
here on a trip with Etihad Airways and
Etihad are the partner of taste Abu
Dhabi and taste festivals are of course
festivals that happen all over the world
and to celebrate the best in cuisine so
here we have in Abu Dhabi some of the
best chefs from all over the world
actually had flown them out here for the
taste of Abu Dhabi festival which is
happening right now and it's just a week
of enjoying the best of Abu Dhabi food
and we're going to be sampling some of
the meals from the chefs that have flown
over I've met chefs from Hong Kong chefs
from Perth Melbourne so yeah chefs from
all over the world are here and as you
have really pride themselves on their in
food they have chefs on every flight
serving incredible food at 44 thousand
miles in the air something absolutely
insane like that so it's a really good
collaboration between taste festivals
and Etihad so yeah that's why we're here
basically thought I would just throw
that in there in case you're getting a
little bit confused but I'm gonna stop
rambling on now because everybody is
starting to settle down and we're going
to start to enjoy this incredible buffet
that the Emirates Palace have put on for
us honestly I don't know I'd start
good morning so apologies I didn't end
the vlog properly yesterday I went into
a little bit of a food coma after the
amazing food at the Emirates Palace so
this morning we left the hotel Bryan
early as you can probably see I'm now in
the middle of a desert and we're about
to do a desert safari with hala Abu
Dhabi's as a tour desert tour company
behind me there are a selection of
camels and we learnt an interesting fact
in the car on the way over
apparently here camel beauty contests
aren't quite a big thing so I'm going to
speak to one of the guys and find out
what it takes to be Abu Dhabi's next
camel model ok so apparently there are
quite a lot of similarities with camel
beauty and human beauty long legs good
body proportions and big lips who knew
there were so many similarities in full
wheel drive doing a little bit of you
mushing which is basically driving in
the sand
try not flip the vehicle wasn't me when
the video says
so here we are in the middle of the
desert this is actually crazy so let me
tell you what a true devotee I am to
being a beauty blogger I have brought
with me trying to show you my yes to
hydrating cleanser so that I can do a
hydration for skin care in the desert
photo yes that is when you know you take
your walking party seriously
oh my gosh I am absolutely roasting I've
just seeked out some shade in this
little 10 area we've just been dune
bashing which is absolutely terrifying
but what is more terrifying is the fact
that we've just come back to 3G and
found that Donald Trump's won the
election which is devastating beyond
words sorry if you don't want me showing
my political views but I'm actually
terrified for the future of the whole
world the global financial situation
terrorism racism feminism is all just
absolutely horrendous and yeah prefer to
say that everyone's attitude is a little
bit more bleak now but going to try and
get that out of our heads so we can
enjoy the rest of the day and we are in
the middle of the desert
we are currently just having some soft
drinks in these tents and I'm about to
go and get some Arabic coffee and or
mint tea might be a little bit more
freshing I wanted to counter how hot I
am so I bought my face no makeup left
it's all melted away but yes I thought I
just update you look at my veins on my
forehead so glad I wash my hair this
morning it's now covered in sweat and
spam so delightful and desert fashion is
not my forte but yeah so let's go and
have a little explore around the camp
and try and get trumps get out of our
heads
slightly different surroundings to when
I last log 2ml at the ritz-carlton and
this building is actually spectacular so
behind me can see
beautiful right stairway leading up this
gorgeous pink buildings looks a little
bit like Disneyland is not going to lie
oh my gosh and this building behind me
the spa ah feels a little bit like LA
and I like it let's do some exploring
so the next thing on our agenda today as
you may have been our guests by my
attire is a mosque visit so we are at
the Grand Mosque here in Abu Dhabi and
I've heard incredible things it's meant
to be really spectacular in there
it's the largest building made of marble
in the world apparently and there is a
Swarovski chandelier inside which is 12
tons so that's like five Range Rovers so
it's going to be an insanely huge
Swarovski chandelier inside I'm
intrigued to go and see it this place
looks absolutely stunning we got a
special
I believe this boy
so I couldn't really vlog in there too
much for obvious reasons didn't want to
make too much of a scene in such a
peaceful place but yeah we're heading
out now and it was absolutely stunning
that chandelier was just mind-blowing I
can't believe how many crystals just
pretty much sums up this entire place
all about extravagance and luxury and
yeah absolutely beautiful
and hold onto my headscarf for dear life
because heat slowing down and I don't
really want to find out what the
punishment is I'm not wearing a
headscarf in here but yes we're heading
to the shangri-la hotel now for a beach
barbecue which should be rather fabulous
so tonight at the shangri-la we are here
for a beach barbecue you can see all the
food and the guests behind me and a
buzzy
ah but we have both died and gone oh
Beauty heaven yes right before yes and
we're excited for sea creature probably
like a new share my guru if it hurts be
duck with you I kick a kick that's
amazing and this is pancakes
