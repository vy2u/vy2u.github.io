excited to be here I've never been to
California before I've never been to the
west coast of America before so I'm
ridiculously excited to be in LA today
so as you probably know I've come to
California with trek America we're here
for eight days so I just did a poll on
Twitter and asked you guys what you kind
of wanted to see video wise and most of
you said you wanted more regular vlogs
so kind of one or two day vlogs on the
vlog obviously every day and and try and
fit in maybe one or two days per vlog
depending on how much I get recorded so
we arrived really late last night and
actually not that late but it felt super
late because of jet lag the flight from
London Gatwick was about 11 hours we
traveled with Norwegian Airways which is
a budget airline but it wasn't that bad
the airplane was really modern it as a
Dreamliner
which is really good because um you
benefit from like their new air
circulation things and none of us got
pulling on the plane which is great and
although you didn't have to pay for
blankets and pillows which is rather
random but luckily I had some with me as
you all know if you watched my pack with
me video anyway um so yeah we arrived
quite late and is about seven o'clock
we're all feeling really really tired we
met with our team leader and and the
rest of the group and then we headed out
to dinner we went to a place called
Marina Del Mar which is obviously on the
bay we had a really really nice dinner
very American just huge portion sizes I
didn't stop vlogging just cuz I was so
tired and then we came back to our hotel
and we're staying here for two nights
this is called the aloft el segundo and
I'm not sure if all Trek America uh
trips include kind of like a hotel as
nice as this at the beginning but yeah
this is my
it's fairly basic nothing to snazzy but
it's it's nice it's very very
comfortable I'm actually in a room by
myself whereas a couple of the guys are
shine with and with someone else as I
said there's eight of us here all
together and but I think we'll be
switching around the rooms and I was
quite grateful into the room to myself
last night I do like my own space and
I'm sure I'm not going to get much of
that this trip anyway I'm gonna go meet
the guys now for breakfast and today we
are exploring la doing all the main
sites and then speech Hollywood sign
Hollywood stars so let's get going Aaron
just gave us our briefing for breakfast
so we kind of know what the plan is we
know roughly the rules and what we're
gonna be getting up to but before we go
any further I want to introduce you to
the team so you're not wondering set in
the background on your video so first of
all we've got Danny so Danny works with
Trek America but nothing lady is pretty
much a pseudonym are they on you man
this job it's a tough job I think I
think I want a nice job and then over
here we got Scott from instructor skate
Scott and then everything got the
girlies we got our low E and Laura
Darren is plugged in this is Darren down
here the Queen City populous we've got
angry very free and pink and Maddie is
over there and behind me we've got
hungry and Greg Lindsay's from trek
America and Greg is going to be catching
every moment on video and finally I'm
here with Helen and I and her boyfriend
Matthew so that is the whole gang and
we're gonna head off now and I think our
first stop is and his speech so in the
two of us on Basia part of the bus
professi today
so behind me is the infamous muscle
beach where Maddie and I are about to go
and do a circuit session sadly there are
no Arnold Schwarzenegger wannabes bottom
you can I comment coffee is cold cold
it's like time froze there you go is you
gloating down
it's like I'm always causing problems
cousin
mean to put your produce so we've
arrived at Beverly Hills Maddie and I
are just risking our lives to get the
perfect Instagram photo but this street
is so beautiful it's like stereotypical
la you've got the palm trees lining the
road and these houses on my God look oh
that would look like a council house not
that one this one behind me they're so
stunning so we're now just going to make
our way to the Beverly Hills sign Rodeo
Drive is like just there so yeah really
exciting the sun's finally come out and
it finally feels like we're in proper LA
can't do anything about this one in the
background
good plan or impersonal paparazzi we are
now on Rodeo Drive and I'm not going to
live completely surreal because I have
seen at this place in film so many times
pretty woman when my favorite films of
all time and it's just so crazy to
actually be here I need to pinch myself
every 10 seconds and shopping heaven
thank you
that is just a dream soybean in Chanel
and we're now in Tory Burch and I may
have bought something in each of them I
was really good at my straight yeah that
seemed to change because idea about what
process of war
we've just come out of Valentino and
some sandals I've had my eye on in the
sale 40% off I'm not going to lie I'm
really really tempted don't know why I'm
feeling room spend each day but the
things that Rodeo Drive does to you I
can see why pretty woman went absolutely
crazy around here you spotted anything
that your night I think I have but I
think tory burch bag is calling Maddie's
name so guys I've just learned about a
new phenomenon it's called the
videographer run it's both it's called
the little gay the little game run
little gay cameraman run give us an
example Greg yes you have to like you
have to do it okay so to get that super
smooth show yes look at the stance
- one go look at that
such a pro so this is how you get those
super smooth shots
yes great works I turned over there are
you right-handed yeah that one right
turn yeah okay this one you don't really
hold it
so this one you don't hold it you just
you use your fingers yeah but now and
then bend your knees run that way so
bend your knees and run here we go
there we go lower lower
hey come back hey we go with my camera
come back my camera yeah lower lower
smaller steps smaller steps get lower
smaller steps smaller steps you're a
natural
pro athlete bro
at least I get a little pan
dropping down from
so after a 40-minute road trip in the
car we are now at the top of the
Hollywood Hills I've got a slight change
of outfit I changed my tops that I could
get it at 10:00 and I put on some
trainers because we're now going to
track from the observatory which is that
way to the Hollywood sign which is over
there you can't really see it at the
moment but it's so surreal I just caught
glimps votanis another one of those
things again I've seen in certain movies
and TV shows and actually seeing it for
real life it's it's really amazing can
you spot it yet can you spot it yet
there it is
the Hollywood sign we're trekking over
there now
we
ya can't breathe when you look at me I
see it's a blurry sense of what you love
me
right
so we've stopped our little track at the
Tiffany and Co lookout point which is a
rather bad place to see the Hollywood
sign we've now come to the heart of
Hollywood's I'd kind of say this is like
the
silly circus of
maybe and we're just meeting a tool
right and our first selfie in LA a lot
of me so we're going to meet a cool guy
we are going to walk down the Hollywood
Walk of Fame
when
stereo
and so are they west 22
Oh
this right here is the hotel where
pretty woman was sat in her more prosy
days
quit this game
mix-ins easy doesn't make things easy
No
wait
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
