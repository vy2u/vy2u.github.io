Oh
hi darlings welcome back thanks for
joining me for today's video it's going
to be my February favourites so a
roundup of everything that I loved this
past month ranging from beauty products
that I've loved my favorite fashion
items which let's be honest you probably
will be able to predict if you are
following me on Instagram and generally
watching YouTube videos so I'm gonna get
started as I usually do with my fashion
items and as I said I know you guys do
see me wearing these a lot on my
Instagram excetra etc but I think it's
really nice to pinpoint those real core
favorites the things that I've been
wearing with loads of different outfits
the things I've been getting a lot of
use out of because I do put out a lot of
fashion content so it's really nice to
spotlight those real true favorites
alright so the first one is
unsurprisingly my Reis blush colored
coats now I think this is called the
macy coat but I may be wrong it will be
linked down below as well everything
that I mentioned in this video this coat
is just the most gorgeous silhouette I
find it so feminine yet so professional
I adore the color of it I'm so excited
to wear this all the way into spring it
is lined so just about warmer for
wearing now if I've got perhaps a
thermal and a long-sleeve knitted top on
underneath it does also have a waist
belt but to be honest the way that I
love to wear this is just over the
shoulders so it's a very relaxed way of
styling this and I just think this makes
your whole outfit look incredible so
I've been really loving wearing this
this month and to be honest I've
probably worn it to 90% of the occasions
I've gone two days four meetings any
special blogger event so I'm going to
I've been wearing this and yeah
absolutely love it already
getting through that price per wear
another really classic fashion piece
that I've absolutely adored wearing this
month and is this wool knit top from LK
Bennett I really like investing in very
classic and simple pieces that you can
wear year after year and that work with
so many different outfits and really
this is just the definition of that kind
of piece there is no design detail other
than a few and they almost look like
stripes down at the bottom here but
other than that really not any design
detail which makes it so so versatile I
have been wearing this top with for
example suede skirts this is one of my
favorite combinations with this high
waisted suede skirt from
millon another item that I've loved this
month and also with trousers these are
my Rhys pale pink nudie trousers these I
would say are another fashion favorite
of the month they're incredibly
comfortable to wear very tight fitting
to the body really flattering and just a
perfect trouser for this time of year I
think if you can get away with not just
wearing black white and gray to work
they make a lovely work trouser but if
you've been watching my outfit diary
videos my vlogs and you've been keeping
an eye on my Instagram then you will
know that I've been wearing these items
so much this month so a big fan of both
of these too and also I feel like you
probably will have predicted this one I
have to include this jumper from French
Connection I first wore this to shoot a
Monica Benedict campaign and I featured
an instagramer insert on the screen here
I absolutely adore that photo love that
outfit so much so that I wore that
outfit again in my romantic lookbook
I'll insert a clip over the screen here
of me wearing it too during my romantic
lookbook but as well as those more
dramatic looks I've also been pairing
this with the Reese trials as I just
showed you tucking it in slightly at the
front I find it's so wearable yet so
statement at the same time I adore these
sleeves of the floral detail it's about
I think it's either 85 or 95 pounds and
begin with I was like quite a lot of
money on something that is fairly
statement but I have actually got so
much wear out of this and we're not even
officially in spring yet so I'll
continue to be wearing this for the next
few months and definitely get it out
next spring - so yeah French Connection
I am a huge huge fan of this top on a
more casual note I have absolutely loved
these trousers this month they aren't my
knitted cream colet's which are from
River Island I work from home so a lot
of the time I'm in my loungewear and I
do still like to look and feel
fashionable when I'm working from home
so what I've been wearing a lot of the
time has been these and obviously
they're super comfortable as super
stretchy so I can just lounge about in
them they do get covered in dog hair but
I don't find that they really show it I
mean if I look closely I can see don't
care on them but it's not too obvious
and then I've been wearing a pink jumper
most of time the pink jumper that I've
been wearing a lot is Dorothy Perkins
and as I said these are River island and
it's pretty much been my go-to outfit
for my days working from home
do fool just above the ankles so I've
been wearing my slippers as well so cozy
I feel like they look really chic and I
almost want to leave the house and I'm
wearing this to show how chic my now and
wear is but yeah big big fan of those
and very affordable to I don't know if
you can hear my phone going off in the
background but that's just reminded me
how much I absolutely adore my Michael
Kors watch so my phone is actually not
in this room and normally I'd be like oh
my god I need to see who's what's having
me but I can actually see I'm gonna come
a bit closer I can see here obviously
it's upside-down for you guys that it is
Charlie that's been what surfing me so I
feel like I spoke about this so so much
before Christmas I still absolutely
adore it you can set it so that you get
your notifications pop-up so if you're
in a meeting or if your phone is in your
bag you don't need to go rummaging just
when you hear your phone ding you can
just check it on your watch obviously it
tells the time it looks super chic I
think for a SmartWatch it's absolutely
beautiful so I wasn't actually intending
to include this in my favorites but
that's just reminded me how much I adore
it so yes Michael Kors access SmartWatch
I still AM totally smitten with what I
was about to show you when my watch
started buzzing was these boots and
these I got from LK Bennet they're in
the sale at the moment so I will again
leave them link down below
don't delay if you do like these because
I think there are very limited sizes
left they're like a lilac e brown color
there was beautiful beautiful buttery
soft leather perfect heel height and I
just love boots I love wearing these
with again the pink creased rousers that
I showed you I love wearing them with my
suede skirts and it's just a nice change
to my suede over knee boots which I was
wearing a lot practically every single
day before I got these so a really nice
way to switch it up LK Bennett is a
retailer that previously didn't have too
much from but now I've got a few
gorgeous pieces from there so yeah these
are a real favorites adore the color
adore how they look they fit they feel
everything about them I know
and another very unsurprising one has
got to be my mulberry handbag this is my
mulberry zipped face water in the shade
always get this wrong I think it's blush
Rose I did a what's in my handbag video
where I talked a little bit about this
gave it a mini review and shows you
what's inside so if you're feeling nosey
I will leave that video linked on the
screen now generally I use this in my
everyday bag it's very spacious fits all
of my stuff in
and yet it still looks really really
chic to carry so yeah and using this as
my everyday bag and I love it so before
we move on to my beauty favorites I have
three other things to mention firstly my
favorite video of the month and I have
to give a shout out I don't know if this
is really weird giving something that
I've created a bit of a spotlight but I
bloody love my romantic lookbook this
month so I worked with cats my amazing
videographer and we filmed this fabulous
romantic lookbook part 2 in this amazing
house called Hetzel house which is
stunning their bridal suite is amazing
as you will have seen if you watch the
video basically last Valentine's Day so
2017 we produced the romantic lookbook
and it was my favorite video of all time
I used it whenever I wanted to show
someone like this is what I can do this
is mine this is what my youtube channel
is all about this is my style love that
video so much that I decided to recreate
it this year we went back to the exact
same place I wore similar outfits the
song is very similar on the song I love
love the song love all the outfits love
how it was edited so if you guys have
not seen in my romantic lookbook yet
then please go and check it out I will
leave a clip of it on the screen now so
you can see what kind of vibe it is it's
just basically the most fun girly look
but if you've got a prom coming up if
you're looking for bridesmaids dresses
if you get to go to special events where
you can wear beautiful things but then a
few of the outfits are really wearable
for just you know going shopping with
your girlfriend's things like that so
give that a watch and leave me a comment
on that video and let me know what you
think because it's something I'm really
really proud of so yeah that is a
favorite of this month another favorite
which I don't have right here because
it's all plugged in but I did want to
mention is our Amazon Alexa echo Amazon
echo show now we've had this for about
three weeks and before getting it I
didn't really think I wanted one but now
I absolutely love it what I use it most
for is listening to music it's got a
really good I think it's a Dolby um
speaker in there and I just say a neck
sir plays some upbeat music or an extra
play magic chilled FM and it will do
that or for example on Valentine's Day
when Charlie and I got back from The
Lion King all we wanted to do was listen
to those songs so I
said Alexa play The Lion King soundtrack
and then it just bursts into life and we
love it for that I have it on all the
time and it's better quality music than
our radio so that's just always on in
the background in fact it's on right now
so so if you can hear some mumblings but
we also if China bickering about
something like you guys noticed in one
of my vlogs Charlie thought Kilimanjaro
was in Nepal and I was like no it's in
South America it's not it's in Asia we
were both wrong so we settled that
argument by asking Alexa what she
thought so yeah it's a really really fun
ours is the echo show so it's got a
screen on it you can follow recipes you
can do makeup tutorials on it it's
really good fun highly highly recommend
if you like that kind of thing in your
house another electrical that I love has
been our Philips alarm clock light I
think it's called the somnium something
like that but I'll leave a video clip of
it on the screen now it is amazing I was
so intrigued to try one of these lights
of alarm clocks because previously
Charlie and I was setting our mobile
phones to wake us up at 6:30 a.m. and I
don't know if you've heard the Apple
alarms but they're so loud and so strong
it's like so loud I'm Charlie I were
literally asleep and then we'd wake up
with a shock so it was really you know
not a great way to start the day when
you're literally jumping awake in the
morning so we wanted something more
subtle we've set the Philips alarm clock
light to start to wake us up at 6:30 and
that's about 6:15 it starts to glow very
subtly so you wake up really really
gently and then at 6:30 it's pretty much
reached daylight brightness and you can
also set a very soothing alarm noise
we've got ours set on Swiss Mountain
which is it starts off just being a
little bit of breeze and then you get
and then you get very gentle cowbells if
you've ever been to Switzerland or watch
The Sound of Music you'll know that very
relaxing I think it's quite relaxing
noise of the big cowbells just to
Chandrakala John as they mooch around in
the mountains and then every now and
then you get a mooing noise as well so
it's just a really nice way of gently
waking up and Charlie and I both said
that we've had so much more energy in
the mornings because of it so huge huge
huge fan of
and in the final thing that is a
favorite this month that I don't have to
show you is suits on Netflix I'm part of
the probably millions of people that
have started watching it from the
beginning I never saw it before because
of Meghan Michael I am only on Episode
five right now I only watch it when
Charlie's not here because he's already
seen it all so I'm just very slowly
catching up he's away at the moment I
get to watch it every evening and yeah
really really liking it I have a bit of
a crush on Harvey Specter I'm not gonna
lie but yeah really enjoying the suits
okay so now we move on to the final
category which is my beauty favorites of
the month you guys will have seen a few
of these in the intro I hope you like
that and okay so lip balms tinted lip
balms in particular I love I love them
all throughout the year but especially
when it's chilly outside I have two
favorites I just could not decide
between the two firstly this one from by
Terry which is their hyaluronic sheer
Rouge new dis MO and this one is a pale
pink I keep this one in my handbag it
looks like this and it's the most
beautiful soft pink color really really
beautiful petal pink I would call it and
it's also anti-aging for the lips it
fills in any lines I feel like it plumps
my lips very very subtly and I just
adore how it looks really really
beautiful color and then another
gorgeous one is this one from Galan this
is from their lap a tea robe Noire
collection beautiful packaging and then
this one is more of a brownie pink
hopefully you can see that so both of
these just live in my handbag this one
by the way is scented like the lafferty
road noir fragrance and oh my goodness
so depending on if I want a brownie nude
or a pinky nude I've been reaching for
one of these too
and I I wear them every single day I
absolutely love them when I'm at home
out for meetings I normally put a
lipstick on first thing in the mornings
and then I'll top up with a tinted lip
balm throughout the day if you want to
see really clearly how these look on
then skip to the end of my last weekly
vlog which is I think it's called
blogger brides and everyday makeup
routine skip to the bit that I film in
my pink jumper in my bedroom because I
do a makeup routine and you can see me
using this one and it just shows how
gorgeous it is so yeah I've been doing a
little bit more beauty in my weekly
vlogs so keep a lookout for that if you
want to see how I'm doing
makeup and skincare on an everyday basis
check out check out the blogs for the
base I have been really loving the new
concealers from bare minerals so the
bare Pro Foundation is my favorite
foundation is great for the skin
fabulous coverage I just adore it as you
guys know and now they have released the
bare Pro concealer as this one is in the
shade medium mutual Oh 8 there's a
lovely big shade range of these this is
the one that I have been using you can
see it is a stick concealer but I do
find it very creamy very soft and really
really long-lasting I use it both under
the eyes although I do use a lighter
shape and this I've got to a really
light shade for under the eyes this one
I use mostly on my chin my chin has
really weird skin it sometimes oxidizes
so basically the foundation just it
vanishes and it looks like my skin is
peeling and my pores are just huge
horrible horrible skin on my chin this
covers it up and makes my chin look
flawless I put it on me for this video
and how great does my chin look right ok
I just absolutely love this really
beautiful formula really long-lasting
and it's part of the bear pro range so I
basically knew I was gonna love this a
couple of products and which I have been
also loving for my complexion firstly
this blusher from by Terry this is the
compact expert jewel powder in the shade
and the light you've got a big mirror in
the lid there and then the blusher
itself is almost like a brownie pink
which I adore and then it's also got a
little highlight in the middle there so
what I tend to do is swipe my brush over
all of it apply to my cheeks and it
gives a very luminescent blush I would
say and just the perfect shade for me
love the compacts nice and thin really
lightweight and that's been my go-to
blush for the past month or so and also
this product here this is the Tom Ford
Soleil bloom highlight this has actually
restored my faith in highlighter or
having highlights on my complexion I
never used to really get the whole big
deal about highlight until I started
using this on a regular basis I I put
someone quite a long time ago today so
its dulled a little bit especially as
I've been putting a little bit more
powder over the top but it is the most
beautiful beautiful highlight again if
you watch my weekly vlog that went live
on Monday check how my makeup looks when
I'm about
go for dinner with origins I was wearing
it then and again skip to the end where
I do my everyday makeup and you can see
this in action I think it looks
absolutely gorgeous it's just the most
perfect highlight a real pearlescent
moon shine the packaging is heavenly as
well and I've used this a lot and it
doesn't look like it's going anywhere at
all so hopefully it's going to be a
really lovely long lasting one - next is
a lip liner favourite and this is the
Charlotte Tilbury lip cheat in the shade
hot gossip I am a huge lip line of fan I
wear lip liner pretty much every single
day I really think it helps define and
add fullness to my lips and I love the
effect this is my current go-to hot
gossip it is a pinky shade but I would
say a brownie pink and no matter what
color lipstick I'm wearing this goes
with it perfectly because quite similar
to my actual lip color and even if I'm
wearing my tinted lip balms that I was
speaking about earlier this just helps
to add a little bit more definition to
my lips when I am just wearing a bomb so
love that one a lot and then we have the
benefit the bad girl bang mascara once
again in my weekly vlog I did a real
before-and-after with this so that's a
very good way of showing the impact that
this has it has had a lot of hype around
it but I think for good reason it really
is amazing I've been using this every
single day it separates the lashes with
one coat you just get that beautiful
fluttery doe-eyed look with two coats
you get some volume and some drama and
with three coats you get real false lash
effect dramatic lashes I absolutely love
it benefit can do no wrong when it comes
to mascara I still love roll - I still
love their real I still love original
bad gal but yeah I have been using this
very very regularly and I have actually
been getting compliments on my lashes
and I've been wearing this so a huge fan
Wheldon benefit it is worth the hype
final makeup product and it is this
eyeshadow palette from Marc Jacobs this
is called the iconic multi finish eye
palette in the shade 720 glam Bishan and
inside I'm very basic when it comes to
my eye makeup I pretty much only wear
Browns this is all of the shades that I
use in one palette so really handy I
feel like I feel like this could have
been one of those build your own
palettes that's how perfect they are for
me
so it's got
lighter shade here which I use under the
brow bone these for really I use on
everyday basis sometimes I use just one
sometimes I add this all over my lids
and then this one in the crease for a
little bit of definition and then these
two I use far less but if I do want to
add a little bit more definition to my
lash line I'll use actually I'm using a
lip brush or a slanted eyeliner brush to
just pack this really close to the
lashes to make it look like I'm wearing
eyeliner but it's far more soft so I've
been using pretty much exclusively this
eyeshadow palette and I love how small
it is it means I can travel with it too
it does have a mirror in the lid as well
so great for application so this has
been my go-to your eyeshadow palettes
from Marc Jacobs throughout February and
then finally we have three fragrances
I'm very sorry I could not Whittle it
down because I have fallen in love with
all three of these fragrances this month
I have reformed in love with the Liz
Earle number 15 botanical essence this
is a very natural fragrance and yet the
smell is amazing I actually think this
is almost like a sexy man smell it's got
tonka bean in there and vanilla which I
find just so sexy when I wear this
Charlie is always like is dealing my
fragrance and I'm like no it's Earl I
adore this if you really like smelling
like a sexy man then I'm going smell
this but also I would say it's trying to
open it around successfully but I would
still say it's feminine it does have a
light floral e note in there as well I'm
very bad at picking out the individual
notes but oh my goodness seriously if
you are near a little counter then you
really must smell this it's absolutely
incredible in fact it's making my mouth
water and I need to cover myself with it
right now I also find it a very
uplifting fragrance so I do spritz
myself with this before going to the gym
and it really kind of wakes me up my
personal trainer and everyone else and
the gym is always like oh someone smells
good so I just yeah I've been really
really loving that this month a
rediscovery and I read some mine a much
newer fragrance favorite this is the
Viktor and Rolf new flower bomb nectar
fragrance I very recently went to the
launch dinner of this I actually smelt
this in a magazine a couple of months
before it even launched and I fell in
love with it then you know and they have
the little peel out thing and you just
rub it everywhere
whip of it loved it then as you guys
know or you may know I'm a huge fan of
Flowerbomb it's probably my lifetime
favorite fragrance so I'm always so
excited when they bring out a new
addition and this one is a slightly
higher price point it is slightly
sweeter I would say it's got kind of a
sparkling nectar notes obviously it is
flower bomb nectar and it's got vanilla
I think it's got amber in there as well
as well as those super floral notes that
we all know and love from a flower bomb
it is an intense fragrance so you need a
little bit less and the higher price
point reflects that gorgeous bottle very
similar to the original flower bomb but
different so you can definitely tell
them apart on your dressing table so
this one I think is gonna very stiffly
become my everyday fragrance just so
much and lastly the Chloe Nomad
fragrance once again I'm a huge fan of
the original Chloe fragrance so it's
really excited to try their new one this
is once again quite a mature fragrance I
think it does it really does smell how
you would imagine a Chloe girl to smell
I don't if that's just my imagination
going a little bit crazy it is quite
sweet you have to be quite careful not
to overdo this literally two squirts is
all you need it's a very powerful
fragrance I adore the bottle of this one
as well so stunning I really like how
this looks on my dressing table you've
got this suede pink section here it says
Chloe on one side Nomad on the other I
think if you are a fan of the original
Chloe fragrance then you will definitely
love this one and I am and I do so yeah
that's got to be my third perfume
fragrance of the month oh my goodness I
