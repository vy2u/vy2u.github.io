vlog I just got my camera out in a bit
of a rush and a bit of a fluster because
I wanted to show you this lovely
well procession that's going on midway
through my seats on power mouth look at
this
so we're in my favorite place to shoot
vlog photos I'm with a lovely Georgia
and we are shooting some new snaps at
Instagram on her mouth which you
obviously have seen a million tons of
Instagram and I think that was some kind
of practice procession they're currently
heading down towards Buckingham Palace
which is down in British you hold me
without touch you don't you chase to
pull me back up I can't speak your mind
sipping on the give me nothing what is
up I can't tell you
the building walls your brakes and
Oh
Oh every time I go brings back
so just quickly catching up
I'm at the corner hotel now dressed
head-to-toe in Elko Bennet I'm here for
an elk a Bennet and Jenny Packham
afternoon tea very excited so you saw my
outfit of the day earlier but beautiful
blouse and skirts which you might have
spotted it's my blog amount and boxing
and then actually I can show you about
to here these boots which are like a
beautiful lush almost lilac
leather this is the outfit
see I'm building
your braixen
Oh
morning it's Tuesday and today is a busy
day of meetings out in town starting off
at the Petersham nurseries in Covent
Garden for a restaurant with the leader
and they are a keen Beauty skincare
brand we're going to be listening to one
of their experts about how to makeup
beauty routine a little bit more clean
get out all chemicals I'm very excited
to learn Lots and eat some lovely food
let me show you around the spaces as
your stomach I walked past it so many
times but never been in but it really is
a beautiful have and ownerless breakfast
set up some of the products this I'm
very excited to try nude lip balm this
is everyone's favorites and the bottom
of all my handbags were later skinfood
this as well if you're looking for a
more natural deodorant love okay
come again now with my birthday boy
it's little Dickies first birthday today
how does it feel one year old young man
so I had a very productive morning had
three meetings this morning I'm getting
probably stare down here yes I had three
meetings this morning after the leader
event and that was a really lovely
breakfast it was actually quite
eye-opening so obviously a leader they
are one of the leaders in natural beauty
I've used a lot of their products before
Dexter has come to join it as well so
we'll leisure the products that I have
loved and used from them before include
their dry skin food which is the it's
like a I use it mostly for a hand cream
but you can also use it I've used it on
holiday if I've had any slight burns any
skin irritations it's just like a
calming moisturizing product which
everybody loves I also use their
pomegranate deodorant so you don't have
to put aluminium or loads of like
chemicals on your underarm areas and it
still works amazingly I love their birch
body scrub they've just got loads of
really nice products which are a lot
more natural this morning we were
learning about the harmful effect of
putting so many chemicals on our skin
and they had this like menu of the
top-selling 12 products that most women
use every day so that top selling
shampoo top selling moisturizer things
like that and it listed all the
chemicals in them and it was really
quite gross so I am gonna make a
conscious effort to be a lot more
natural in my skincare routine I have
been very aware of it for the past year
or so but this morning was really
eye-opening so I'm going to try a lot
harder to be a lot more natural so if
you guys are interested in that then I
will obviously be sharing my journey
into making natural swaps and then I had
a couple more meetings I had a meeting
with the girls from Kiehl's and then I
met my reward style Account Manager so
rewards style is the company where I do
my affiliate links when you see
underneath here you see a description
box and links to products I've mentioned
I as I'm sure you know may get a small
percentage from the sale and it's almost
it's called reward style so I guess it's
rewarding the youtuber or bloggers that
inspired your purchase
obviously doesn't affect you as a
shopper but it means that we get a
little bonus from the retailer for
inspiring your sale and I work with them
quite closely it's really nice to track
my sales it means that I can see what
you guys are buying and I can make sure
that I'm talking about the right things
so what retailers you like the most what
retailers I talk about but maybe you
don't buy so much of that was a very
very interesting meeting and I was meant
to have two more meetings but how he's
not very well so I've come back home
I've arrived back home to an amazing
delivery from Charlotte Tilbury so I'll
show you that in a second but I have got
some pasta cooking right now Charlie
just needed some comfort food so I'm
making a mac and cheese after a lovely
healthy breakfast this morning are you
kissing me and and I wanted to get back
to my birthday boy so Nikki and I are
just gonna spend the afternoon nursing
Charlie back to good health and then I'm
packing for a photo shoot tomorrow we
have a full day photo shoot so I'll show
you how I prepare for that but for now
I'm gonna go and continue making my
macaroni cheese my favorite meal in the
world I have already told you in a few
vlogs how I make it but I still get lots
of questions
I'll leave linked up on the screen my
first step on what I eat in a day video
because that's why I do the full recipe
we are in action just gonna grate the
cheese and it's time to eat
so this is the bouquet that I came home
to from Charlotte Tilbury
a giant do you call it a bouquet of
balloons cluster of balloons I have a
feeling at the Duchess bond girl love
trap I have a feeling they are names of
lipsticks but it's just like a big
Valentine's bouquet we've got a crown
hot gossip look at this very
instrumental and then here is the
selection of goodies it says darling
feel like a queen this Valentine's Day
oh and then inside what have we got look
ooh la la I think we have some new lip
products I thought I'd just pop the
camera up there while I unbox them so
here we go this one is called legendary
Queen that is a beautiful kind of
burgundy color very regal this one is
called the Queen Ella it's almost like
got a little bit of fuchsia in there but
still a very classic red shade and then
this one is called the Duchess that is
beautiful imagine this with a slightly
deeper lip liner don't be stunning have
some adorable little Charlotte Tilbury
stickers in the goodie bag and then I
think this is another lipstick a Kashmir
cream texture with a soft matte finish
this one is called opium Noir oh my
goodness look at that is so stunning
short TOB lipsticks are just the most
beautiful shades and then we have a
selection I think this might be lip
liners I use pillow talk on a very
regular basis I have it in my handbag as
my kind of top up on this looks like it
could be a pillow talk this one is
called supersize me well and it's the
perfect brownie nude shade this one is a
burgundy color called walk of shame then
we have got Bond girl which is a
slightly darker pink oh my goodness and
I think I've seen this one before but
the shade is perfect a really brownie
pink called hot gossip and another
brownie pink this one
is called love trap I find that these
kind of brownie pink shades are just
super super versatile and you can't
really get much better than Charlotte
Toby's lib sheets so just reading the
press release it says that the actual
lip service collection this is going to
be 65 pounds for the full collection in
the at your lip service little box or
they are 24 pounds to the individual

your thumb
just let me know just let me have it is
Wednesday and today if any of you guys
recognize where we are then it means
you've been watching my channel for a
year because it's been exactly one year
since cats and I filmed our romantic
lookbook here last year and we're ahead
saw housed in the beautiful bridal suite
and with filming romantic lookbook part
two because to this day it's my favorite
video on my channel I loved filming it I
just was so so happy with that video so
we come back again to the most amazing
room in the world let me give you
another tour in case you didn't spot it
last time look how stunning this room is
so if you get married here then this is
the room where you'd like get ready and
then through here the most spectacular
bathroom with this double shower area oh
my gosh this place is so stunning my
outfit of the day before starting
filming is this little lk bennett jumper
just super easy breezy and then my Karen
Millen leggings which are the leather at
the front fabric at the back and then my
socks are sweaty Betty and then if you
go through the bathroom you have the
most darling bedroom do you guys
remember the photos that I took here
last year oh my gosh
so this is the bridal bedroom how
beautiful imagine getting ready with
your bridesmaids here oh I just love it
so much I want to live here
the day that
sooner is a waste
soon the Rizzoli
wish the
take it serious she's trying
colleges
I understand what you mean when you say
oh shoot complete successful very
successful morning we were shooting for
about three or four hours and we're
heading off now we I should have bought
some more stuff with me to shoot even
more but we're done so I thought I would
just show you the outside of the house
good morning it is Thursday I'm about to
head out into town for a day of meetings
and I thought I would show you my outfit
of the day before I head out in case I
don't get the opportunity to show you
later cuz it's quite a quite a Josie I
hope it today
so I have you'll be pleased to hear
switched up my suede skirt I still
absolutely love my Reece Juan but I
think you guys are getting a little bit
bored of seeing me wearing that all the
time so I have a new one it's very very
similar it is from Karen Millen what I
love about this one I think you can
probably tell is that it is so
high-waisted when I first saw it on the
hanger I thought it might just be quite
long and potentially a bit unflattering
but I thought you know what I have to
try this and it is so beautiful I love
how high-waisted is I feel like it's
ultra flattering this band that goes
around the waist is just dreamy it makes
you look so nipped in at the waist very
feminine and it's just a really nice
length but this is my knee cap here
covered by my Karen Millen boots you
guys have seen these a million times I
love them so much and yeah just as
little bit of thigh as on show so not
too revealing but still just really cute
and feminine and then I've actually worn
this top so much lately this is a top I
got in Ted Baker sale it does also have
this kind of fluted detail at the bottom
so I've tucked that in but because the
suede is quite structured you can't see
it poking out which is great and then as
I said I've got my caramel and boots on
just flip you round to show you my face
because I did try a new lip combination
this morning and I'm a big fan so I went
to a Laura Mercier lip launch a couple
of weeks ago I think you will have seen
that and then I actually emailed the PR
and said I would really love to try some
of your lip liners because the shades of
the lip Velvets I think they're called
were just so dreamy and they very kindly
sent some overs so I am wearing the
Laura Mercier lip pencil
natural lips I think the shade that I
have is natural lips doesn't seem to
have any other name on it it says seven
one six zero you won pretty sure that
it's going to be called natural lips and
then I wanted something a little bit
moist rising a little bit barmy but with
a lot of color so for my lip color I've
got the Burberry kisses nude 505 and it
just gives like a little bit of a sheen
and if your lips are dry or if you know
you're gonna be going outside and you
don't want to full-on matte lip but you
want a really nice intense color I've
just rediscovered my love for this and
together they are the dream combination
that's my current lip favorite and then
today I also spritzed on a new fragrance
this is the new Chloe fragrance you may
have seen me opening this up if you
watched my blogger melon boxing video
that was live last Wednesday this is
Chloe Nomad fragrance and it's I think
it's the second ever perfume from Chloe
I may be wrong but I absolutely love it
I love the first one this one's a bit
more fresh a little bit kind of fruity
it's got a definite sweet fruitiness to
it but I love it berry me what else did
I try today I had a bit of a morning of
trying some new things I tried actually
a new Laura Mercier foundation this is
the candle glow soft luminous foundation
I'm having a very weird skin period at
the moment ever since I had reflexology
which was on Monday evening and my
skin's just kind of been breaking out a
bit more nothing seems to stick almost
on my chin and particular my makeup just
vanishes I've got those under skin
pimples on my forehead so yeah generally
not very good skin time but actually I
am impressed with the coverage of this
Laura Mercier has given me and I did my
usual bronzer by Terry blusher oh I
actually tried a new eyeshadow it's
morning as well this is the white peach
eyeshadow palette from Too Faced as you
can imagine the eyeshadows are very
delicately scented with the peach
fragrance it looks like this and I used
sweet fig which is the brown shade on
the far furthest away from me in the
middle and then also peach sorbet which
is the peachy shade closest to me in the
middle and yeah I think it's a really
nice warm soft combination so I'm going
to put my coat on and grab my handbag
and then show you my final outfit of the
day
okay so coat is on this is my caramel
and coat from last year but they do have
a really similar
in the sale this yes I'll leave that one
link down below double-breasted I think
you guys have seen this once again a
million times does have this tie waist
which I like to do up for a little bit
more of a shape but yeah love this coat
a lot it was a really really good
investment piece
lots of neutrals today but I think by
mixing neutrals it doesn't ever look at
you boring and yeah these are kind of
things that are all they're all
investment pieces are all kind of
premium High Street pieces but I get so
much wear out of everything that I'm
wearing now so no regrets when spending
a little bit more on these kind of
classic pieces and then my handbag is my
new mulberry bag oh my goodness I'm so
so happy with this bag it's just who
knows me bag ever it's so practical fits
my laptop inside its most beautiful just
a slight tint of like a rosy blush shade
but it is a very versatile brown and it
just goes with everything so yeah this
is my new everyday Homburg my outfit of
the day having a super bad hair day I'm
heading off for a meeting at the
woolsley hotel now and then I have a dar
fan facial which I'm so looking forward
to I always say to anyone that's looking
to like gift someone a facial that
darthon facials are the best they are so
relaxing and I'm going to the spa
Luminato for that so timed head off I'll
see you later
I just last-minute decided to add my
burberry scarf because I've had this for
two years and I very rarely wear it so I
think I'm just always kind of saving it
for best but I decided to pop this on so
this is my finished ready to go outfit
of the day
never
that this life
it gives fire
showing you the treatment room this is
where I'm going to be a relaxing the
next hour or so
she's gonna just take a look at my skin
they don't have like a menu they just
look at your skin and then tell you
which dolphin products are going to use
and it's now of bliss so I'll see you
after that my vision my facial it was
absolutely but you don't have to
necessarily choose which facial you want
you can just kind of go to them lie on
the bed which is heated so it's very
very nice and then she'll just have a
look at your skin and tell you what she
thinks you need so she looked at my skin
and asked if I had any concerns and I
said that since I've had reflexology I
was getting a little bit of freaked out
on my chin and also I was slightly
concerned about some lines around my
eyes so she used lots of hydrating
products lots of micros oils and lovely
Martha had a massage
well that was sinking in that was a very
very lovely way to start the day and she
said I need to look into the darf an
ideal resource range if I'm concerned
about lines around my eyes I think
that's one for like early signs of aging
if you're just mornings like put a halt
to any wrinkles that might be making
their way onto your face nicely glowing
it now I put a little bit makeup on
because they I'm heading it to a very
nice restaurant for lunch they don't
want to turn milk there's just some oil
on my face it's absolutely freaking safe
and it's about minus one at the moment
so I'm clutching my scarf for dear life
find somewhere to catch up on something
else before my next wedding
it's a few hours late now had a lovely
lunch match thing we always come out
matching accidentally had lovely lunch
with the girls from De Beers and at
Facebook Isabel's it was very posh and I
definitely was not stressed up enough
that was really nice and then Charlie
and I just heard a couple more meeting
and we are now heading out for fishing
yes Charlie is - fine apparently like a
gourmet party to be for the United share
although I would find myself saying
these words that this chippy is
seriously interoperable they have got
pink tables nice Lighting's basically a
food lover
I hope the Baptist churches and holy
ready to loot me Charlie has good old
Cod and chips and such piggies also got
kind of over it jojoba soft-shell crabs
burger I have been craving it
so long
Oh every time I go brings back
social crab burger
good
baby good morning my darlings
it is Friday shower so as you saw we had
there we go as you saw we just had a
personal training session with Adam at
Spurgeon and I feel totally blitz so we
had fish and chips last night and he saw
it on our Instagram the story so he made
us work extra hard this morning
Adam is literally amazing I feel like I
owe a lot to him he's such a good pal
he's gonna come up with his girlfriend
Becky on Sunday for lunch as well so
yeah that was my start today I'm in my
blogger mail unboxing seat and I'm gonna
open a little bit more blogger mail with
you because I have another four or five
days worth since my blogger mail and
boxing video which hopefully you guys
saw last Wednesday that was the most
amazing blogger mail and boxing I think
I've ever done was so many fabulous
products I was absolutely spoilt rotten
feel very generous and I'm always so
grateful to brown I couldn't do as many
beauty reviews or create as much content
as I do without the products from the
brands so very very grateful and it
means I have lots more to talk about
with you guys as well not as crazy
amount today but some really lovely
packages that I wanted to share with you
I also opened up a there was a really
lovely bunch of roses from sa Miyake to
launch there
dode you say pure nectar perfume I
actually already had a few spritzes of
this it's a really kind of light
spring-like fragrance it's got rose
honey and pear in there this is the
bottle it's all inspired by like
dewdrops drops of water drops of nectar
so I think that's gonna be a really
really lovely one for spring I might do
another cheeky spritz so that's I
already opened up because it was with
the beautiful flowers I've left my
makeup quite minimal because I thought
if there's any makeup here that I could
just do a very quick first impressions
so I'm going to open up this box to
start with it's just a plain white box
oh oh this is so cute this is from
Daniel Galvin Daniel Galvin is a place

the plan

popped in the sleeveless version as well
so if you wanted to wear something with
slightly shorter sleeves or you just
wanted the neck detail this is
absolutely perfect okay next we have a
rather big box from Swarovski light in
here never in a million billion years
when I started blogging did I think that
brands would be so generous and send me
anything I hear a lot of I hear a lot of
people saying that they get bloggers
that have literally started their blog
two days ago emailing brands asking for
gifts and it's not something that just
comes with the territory you have to
really build up your platform and you
have to really work hard to receive
lovely things like this when I started
gifting well I didn't even know I was
blogging I was just having bit of a
ramble on the internet to myself and
when a friend reached out some something
saying they wanted to send something it
was something I never in a million years
expected so to receive all these lovely
things is something that I will never
take for granted but equally I would say
and I do get a lot of people messaging
me saying how do they start a blog how
can they work with brands it is not
something that
you just start up and expect to receive
lots of free things it really is
something that is an amazing perk if you
have worked at it for many many years
90% of bloggers in my position
they worked for free they worked without
samples for years and years before
anything was sent to them so we're also
grateful for these lovely gifts but
brands send oh my goodness Oh Josie I'm
Charlie but I'm gonna open it without
Charlie because he's downstairs oh it's
an engagement gift that is so cute look
at this card that is absolutely adorable
dear Josie and Charlie congratulations
on your engagement love from the
Swarovski team and then we have this
rather large box beautifully presented
oh my goodness oh my Wow look oh my
goodness I'm actually speechless
these are so stunning two champagne
glasses oh my gosh I never want to use
these what if they break oh that's so
special oh my gosh they have Swarovski
crystals in the stems and then they're
like a swastika crystal Swarovski
crystal base wow this is the kind of
thing I'm just gonna cherish forever
that is so stunning thank you so so so
much those Swarovski team I can't wait
to show Charlie these he's gonna be so
excited oh my gosh I'm a lucky lucky
lady I'm gonna put them safely in their
beautiful presentation box and I've just
heard that my mum's here so I'm gonna go
and say hello to her and I'll catch up
with you guys in 10 minutes or so

background I have another gift here from
Swarovski this has got pink ribbon ooh

this toggle clasp I feel like if you're
not sure what to get your girlfriend for
Valentine's Day you've still got time to
head down to a Swarovski store you
definitely just could not go wrong with
this oh I like that it's adjustable as
well so even if you don't know her
specific size you can just get this
because it's adjustable how cute does
that look thank you so much to Swarovski
for utterly utterly spoiling me gosh I
feel so lucky oh my goodness I was about
to say this just cannot get any better
but this is a delivery from Lum mare do
Josie please mind closed alum our
favorites the I concentrate for you to
try and I've also popped in some other
products so we have got o we actually
don't have the eye concentrate that's
really funny we have the mist and the
face and body gradual time and this I
wanted to try it so long and I'm a huge
fan of face mist so I thought I would
give the Lum mare one a try really
excited to get both these ago now keep
you guys updated no idea where that's I
concentrated maybe I forgot to pop that
one in let's see yes this next one is
some pitties from Kiehl's I believe yes
aha Lancome ah Lancome and Kiehl's okay
so we have um the lancome genifique
hydrogel melting mask i love sheet masks
so much and I've heard really good
things about this Lancome one glow plump
smooth and texturizer skin rich in
bifidus extract interesting I will be
trying that one out tonight in fact I
have a bit of a pamper night on this
vlog so stay tuned
sunflower color preserving conditioner
and the matching shampoo from Kiehl's i
loving love killed shampoo and
conditioner my hair up so he loves them
I feel like if you wash your hair quite
regularly and not harsh at all so really
good for that and I've not tried their
color preserving on before
so I'm excited to get this a try and
this is the strengthening and hydrating
oil in cream a daily leave-in and when
my hair is kind of like this I already
put an oil in but when it's damp and I'm
about to blow dry it I love to put in
something as like a leave-in product
just helps me brush it helps me to keep
it smooth so I'll give that a go next
time I wash my hair and then package
from Tom Ford huh we hope you enjoy
using the enclosed Tom Ford beauty
products what do we have here
look at this packaging the little TF
logo on that is so stunning I think I
got a press release today and it's their
new palette and Tom Ford pallets are
just spectacular this is the palette
Salette iron cheek palette always come
in these gorgeous little dust cloths as
well which is so sweet beautiful
packaging the score just white case and
inside mmm look at all these beautiful
shades you've got a couple of different
blush colors like a deeper pink and then
this could be used to highlight all
powder formula we've got a really deep
plum shade and then beautiful very
wearable Browns and a light pink in this
little eyeshadow court and then you've
got the mirror lid I like that they
don't put brushes in their palettes
because who actually uses the brushes
and makeup palettes I feel like everyone
uses their own brushes so not necessary
but I will give that a go later on when
I do my makeup properly every package
I'm just blown away by this is from
flour bomb
flower bomb bloom odor toilette oh my
goodness they've just released a new one
called flower bomb nectar and I sniffed
it in vogue and one of the little kind
of pullout adverts and I'm so excited to
try that this is the flower bomb scented
candle which I adore more than any other
candle ever smells incredible perfumed
body lotion if you are a fan of flower
bomb or maybe if your girlfriend is a
fan of flower bomb then you could always
get her like perfumed body lotion or
body wash or I think this is a little
soap or the candle
valentine's day if you don't know by the
fragrance she's already got it i would
say the best thing to get her would be
the candle if well maybe your mom or
anyone that you know that loves la bonne
get them the candle because they would
love you forever this is a little soap
which is adorable and then we have
flower bomb rose twist this is like a
little an mixer so if you want to add a
little bit more floral notes more rosy
floral notes teal fragrance to make it a
little bit different you can just add in
a little bit of this and then we have
the classic beau de parfum flower bomb
which i love i have worn it for so many
years and it's just such a favorite so
fully stocked up thank you very much Bob
on cream so we have a slightly battered
frame but we've got anti-aging smooth
fill lipstick ooh
collagen lipstick from it cosmetics that
sounds amazing and the beautiful bold
classic red and then the matching lip
liner your lips but better I would
always recommend a lip liner if you're
going to apply a red and then it says
hey it girl happy Valentine's Day this
one it's all about you love yourself
apply lipstick and show the world the
most confident you with love date
cosmetics and they put in this frame I'm
gonna have to get it reframed because
knowingly little shards bit are falling
out but we have got if I try and put it
together to show you dear me I thought
Annette it would be the best way to
remind you that girl you slay I love you
I don't tell you enough sometimes I'm
too busy with other stuff I may not say
it each day but want you to know that
come what may
you're so special to me I must take time
to sit back and see it may not always be
easy but you're nailing life cool and
breezy when life seems a little too
heavy and ply your bravery and you'll be
ready
you're more daring than you know your
confidence will run the show and as
always you will be a hit you're
beautiful you are it love me that is so
so gorgeous just a lovely powerful
positive affirmation to look at each
morning
I'm gonna get this reframed and put that
up on my dressing table so what a lovely
thing to just remind yourself off when
you're putting your makeup on each
morning and that's what your cosmetics
is all about so thank you so much to the
team for sending this over I think this
one is another Lancome sheet mask it is
another genifique face mask from Lancome

those this evening we're heading up to
Lincoln tonight to see my family it's a
bit of a road trip my we're gonna see my
granddad and my aunt and uncle so we're
heading off there shortly and then I've
got the press release so I can find out
all the info thank you very much to the
Lancome last but not least this one is
from L'Occitane L'Occitane opened a
flagship store last night on Regent
Street I was meant to go but I had such
a migraine that we called it quits early
on in the evening so she shakes I saw an
Instagram stories how fabulous it looks
so if you're in Regent Street area
definitely check out their new flagship
Oh cute okay so this is actually a
Borean and they are kind of run by the
same company as it blocks tan look how
cute this is a little Valentine's Day
gift oh my gosh it is a coffee mug this
is so perfect I'm about to go on a road
trip and gonna need some coffee so that
is perfect timing
but first coffee put a little herb
ourian and kind of coffee warmer oh my
gosh so I've got a little box of treats
that were hidden underneath the coffee
use the sorbet shear and strong
protection is that an SPF to envelope
the skin making it feel protected
against environmental stressors that's
amazing especially if you live in London
town some new eyelash curlers this is
amazing and these look like very snazzy
ones because mine are reaching the end
of their life so this is perfect timing
I think this is like a little speaker
yeah it looks like it can plug it into
your phone and play the tunes amazing
then we have
bebe drops makeup add-on for a baby's
skin effect that sounds intriguing put a
couple of drops into your hand and mix
together
Oh mix with your day cream that's such a
good idea so if you've got like a
favorite day cream but you want to make
it a little bit more have a little bit
more coverage just add these to your day
cream oh my gosh definitely taking these
with me
this morning and then we have another
sheet mask ooh
BB shot mask my perfect skin look I
think kazoo Borean is Korean skincare
you really know that the skincare
benefits are going to be in every
product in the range so everything I've
tried from them so if I absolutely love
so very much looking forward to trying
some new pieces thank you very much to a
Borean and this has come at the absolute
perfect time as well gonna make myself a
coffee for the road and that is it for
my blogger mail this morning I'm gonna
go and blow dry my hair pack my bag and
then it's time to hit the road so we
have swapped back to the bigger master
the cx-5 for our road trip this is mine
and Charlie's favorite car looks like a
shark from the front it's pretty similar
to the cx-3 with technology except it's
got like these very cool little lights
that flash up here if you're going in
the wrong lane and then loads amazing
tech inside very very snazzy car oh it's
got a very funky little so you've got
your hands full you can just hit this
button and the boot closes automatically
loads of room this is why we thought it
would great for today so you can fit dog
beds all of our bags and things in the
boot and then shuts automatically
dun-dun-dun very nice and then in here
this is where I'm going to be traveling
with the hounds because mums gonna sit
in the front here's my little space lots
of room for the loot and Charlie and
then the puppies are gonna be sitting
here with their seatbelts on of course
morning it's Saturday and we are now up
in Lincolnshire with a family and with
my beautiful cousins Ollie Mae and
Eloise
both of these girlies have their own
YouTube channels
what videos have you up so far sneak
peek what you're about to do I really
liked your Friday night pamper routine
with all the tiebreaker products I need
to get one of those half-acre body
lotions and what have you done in your
time I've done one video but I'm gonna
be posting more and I am doing a night
routine mm-hmm and routine yeah and it's
not real it's just a scale it's real
it's not real routine I'll leave these
girlies channel is linked underneath if
you want to see their school routines in
their pamper routine have a little watch
we have got strawberry mousse and what
else is on the plate I'm a cop
this looks amazing I felt the same
enemies what have you got
where did you marshmallows go have you
polished them off already and you got
mummys jelly hello again it's some day
now
I didn't film too much while I was up in
Lincoln's it was just really nice kind
of quality family time didn't want to be
bringing out my camera every opportunity
but we drove up to Lincoln on Friday and
spent all of yesterday there then drove
back yesterday evening so it's really
lovely to spend time with I saw two of
my uncle's my auntie as well my grandpa
my cousins my second cousins so yeah
it's really lovely to spend time with
lots of family members this weekend
Sunday morning now and I've had a really
like perfect Sunday morning so far
Charlie bought me a coffee into bed and
then we spent a couple of hours doing
like house chores I don't know if that
would be normal people Sunday mornings
but yeah we just did a real like deep
cleaning of the house we washed the dogs
they had a lovely bath and I just had a
really long like hour-long bath with
some relaxing bath salts and did my hair
just had a full-body exfoliation so yes
very lovely pampering a morning I think
I'm gonna film a video as soon as I've
got my hair dry and done because it's
Sunday at the moment and I do not have a
Sunday video yet which I don't normally
like to leave at this last minute but
these things happen it's been a busy
week but I did want to try out and I
mentioned it earlier in the unboxing I
wanted to try out the arborio Bibi drops
I'm so intrigued by these I think that
if you're having like a working from
home day or a Sunday and you've got
fairly good skin my skin is still really
good for my facial eyes on this week
then sometimes you don't want anything
any thicker than a BB cream so this as I
mentioned before you add the drops into
your moisturiser so let's give it a go
okay so I've got my usual is moisturizer
and this is what the Aborn BB jobs look
like I think you can also use the
on their own because at the back it says
apply to the face as a makeup base or to
enhance a complexion and then on the
side of the box it says you can mix it
in with a day cream so I'm gonna try and
mix it in with a day cream I feel like
after an hour long my skin just needs
lots of moisture so I popped a little
bit of my moisturizer on my hand and
then this has got a very snazzy little
kind of container there let's see I've
mixed that all into my moisturizer and
I'm going to apply I guess I'm just
going to apply it as though I'm putting
on a moisturizer so as you can see
that's just given a little bit more
coverage just kind of evened out my skin
tone and to be honest this is this is
the kind of coverage I'd be happy with
on day like today on a Sunday days and
I'm working from home as I can after gym
when you just want a little bit more
coverage if you want to neutralize any
redness so very impressed I feel like
this is the kind of thing you don't
realize that you need until you try it
but I can imagine getting a lot of use
out of that so that is going in my
makeup drawer which is overfly I think I
might film like a beauty product clear
out video because I've actually been not
clearing out things on purpose because I
want to share the process with you so
give this video a thumbs up and let me
know in the comments if that's something
you'd like to see like a beauty product

bonus video on Friday and then I'm
trying to think like a film this
afternoon would you like to see a what's
in my handbag let me know if you guys
would like to see a what's in my handbag
