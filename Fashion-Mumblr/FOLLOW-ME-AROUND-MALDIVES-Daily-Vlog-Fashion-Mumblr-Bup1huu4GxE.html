video is going to be a 1-day vlog a kind
of day in the life of our typical days
here in thieves we are staying at the
Conrad rangoli island here in the South
area to the south of Mali and I thought
I would do a day in the life as opposed
to like a whole collective vlog of the
trip because firstly most days can be
quite similar although there are so many
different things you can do here on
Conrad which you'll see a few of today
but also it's quite nice to switch often
sometimes I thought if I do
vlogging today then you'll get a really
good glimpse as to a typical day in the
Maldives so as you can see I'm still in
my PJs it is about seven o'clock in the
morning I've been up for about 45
minutes
just pottering about I'm sitting outside
on the balcony this is kind of my
favorite time of the day it's very
peaceful there's no wind it's not too
hot although I'd say it's probably
already about 28 degrees if you're
wondering why I have got mascara on
already I don't I actually had
individual lash extensions done I knew
their lashes before I came out so when I
don't have makeup on or don't have you
know and I've just woken up
I can look a little bit they can look a
little bit bold but my first thing that
I do excuse me is come outside to the
balcony or the little kind of decking
area give you a little panning tour so
we're staying in a water villa so we
have this lovely decking and ours is a
sunset one so we can watch the sunset
from here which is so beautiful but what
I like to do is come out and this is my
third glass of water for the day
starting off nice and hydrated and I've
already cleansed my skin inside and then
this is something that I've just really
become obsessed with doing lately I
spritz my face with
this is the herbivore Jasmine green tea
Jasmine water balancing toner firstly
because it's a mist
it's just through his refreshing thing
ever so on a warm morning so so nice and
then when I've misted my skin I'm using
my Jade roller just to aid with any
lymphatic drainage and just helps to
deep up my face and I keep this in the
fridge so it's super cooling really
enjoyable thing to do so that is the
first thing I'm going to do this morning
okay so next it's into the bathroom and
we're doing our Sun cream I like to use
as Clarins one on my face actually a
mixture between depending on if I'm
getting any burning bits this is the
Clarins factor 30 Sun wrinkle her face
and then this is the LA roche-posay
factor 50 dry touch joffrey both of them
are specifically designed for the face
so you don't get that horrible oily
feeling throughout day I'm gonna put
plans on it first and then I'll top up
with the Laura Sharda I like these a
rush on my forehead mm-hmm
it's a lot thicker as much better for
protecting yeah I find my ganache is
totally matte as well whereas this feels
more like a moisturizer and a rough one
is good to take with you yeah I like to
top up so once the Sun cream has had
maybe five minutes to sink in I'm gonna
pop on my bare minerals complexion
rescue this is the foundation that I
wear normally foundation it's like a
tinted moisturizer that I tend to wear
throughout summer it's kind of like a
mix between a BB CC tinted moisturizer
it's got SPF 30 so it's got some
protection in there as well and I just
wear this while I'm traveling because I
find it is so hydrating I feel like it's
an additional moisturizer so it just
keeps the skin nice and hydrated a
little bit of coverage but because it's
bare minerals is not blocking the pores
so perfect for when you're on holiday
and then I'm just using my buffing brush
just to give a really light coverage
okay so obviously I'm not gonna put on
any mascara but I do just brush it
through my lashes a nice and smooth with
this benefit brush and then I'll also do
the same for my brows okay so my SPF is
on a bikini on nearly ready to go I'm
using the Dior Addict lip tattoo
long-wear lip color this one here in
this gorgeous coral shade and I feel
like this is perfect for beachy trips
because it just tints the color of your
lips and lasts
all day Chris
okay let's go this is our morning
commute to breakfast we trot out from
our little water one below
our breakfast table I hate turning there
is anywhere better could possibly have
breakfast yeah oh my goodness and all
the menus are on iPads so they change
them quite regularly so I think I'm
going to go for the Belgium classic
Belgian waffle oh yes as well as the
menu we also have a fabulous buffet to
choose from what's Charlie gonna go for
yogurt and we've got some gluten-free
cereals and fruit it looks good
tell us why you're meeting making me
wait to eat my breakfast darling so this
happens quite regularly I will get some
delicious but also happens to be very
photogenic food for my breakfast
and then this one will decide that he
wants to do a flat leaf or hungry man
about town yes but it's cruel absolutely
fair Charlie's doing a takeover on
Conrad's Instagram stories today so
we've now got to wait for our main
courses before we can touch anything
cheers for that darling foods arrived so
charlie is in a queue
look scared I've gone for Belgian
waffles and Charlie has gone for some
kind of an egg creation looks pretty
good
feeling very full that epic breakfast
Charlie and I are now going to the
overwater spa and we're going to try and
recreate a photo that we took when we
came here just for the day in December
because I'm actually wearing the updated
version of the river island dress that I
shot on this lovely jetty but if you
guys remember this shirt dress from last
year that I wore in Ibiza and it was
like one of the most popular dresses of
summer it sold out in a couple of days
and it was from River Island this is
this year's version so I'll leave it
linked down below if you want to shop it
and get it before it sells out I think
is just out as you watch this video I
think it's being launched like right now
so yeah I'm going to try and recreate
this photo because I was wearing the old
River Island dress then mini morning's
photo shoot now Charlie and I gonna head
to an area called the quiet zone which
is an area on this island I don't think
there's any shorten allowed food it's
very peaceful and we have a couple of
hours until the UK's start to email us
so this is our real downtime we're here
obviously it's a holiday because we're
in paradise but also as bloggers
self-employed folk we are always working
so we do have a couple of hours now
where we can just go and relax
I've got Wi-Fi in the room so I'm going
to be downloading some new books I
finished a book yesterday so I'm on the
lookout for some new books I mentioned
gosh I'm so sharpening I mentioned
audible to you guys in a vlog maybe
three weeks ago and how when I'm at home
I like to listen to audible books when
I'm doing things like cleaning cleaning
my makeup brushes cooking things like
that and I love listening to the secret
I could listen to that over and over
again it's a very big
out of my life if you will but while I'm
on holiday times like this are the
perfect time for listening to audible
books as well because I can just plug my
earphones in enjoy the Sun or the shade
and totally chill out so I'm gonna go
and have a look what books I'm gonna
download today I feel like I want a nice
chick flick something really easy to
listen to
chick flick chicklet I don't know and
have a little browse on the audible
library as with last time I have a
special offer for you guys to download
audible on audible.com slash fashion
mumbler that's my personal little page
and if you go to that website which I'll
leave on the screen now you get a free

books that you guys really like
listening to on airplanes or on the
beach or if you've got any favorites for
your holidays let me know any
recommendations are hugely hugely
welcome so we're gonna pack up our beach
bags now head to the beach and I will
see you guys there alright so here's my
audible app on my phone when I'm looking
for new books it has this featured
section recommended for you obviously
the last because reading was a secret so
it's got lots of books along those kind
of lines how the secret changed my life
actually the power I feel like this is
one that is a bit of a follow up to the
secret so maybe I'll do that one I want
something a little bit more kind of
light-hearted from the beach so maybe
I'll go to categories and nonfiction now
I do like health and personal
development let's have a look on that
it's got everything from celebrity books
you've got Russell Brand it's got loads
of self-improvement ones how to be
yourself
of course you've got all the classics
like Twilight you've got the Harry
Potter's fantastic beasts things like
that and then what you can also do is
type in your favorite author's name I
don't about you guys but when it comes
to Beach reads I always think of Sophie
Kinsella and her shopaholics mugs so I
have downloaded or I've typed in her
name and I don't think I've read that
one how to keep a secret or no can you
keep a secret
it's got on domestic goddess Oh I've not
read that one either I've got your
number
secret dream world of a Shopaholic I
feel like that is the ultimate Beach
read so I'm gonna have a scroll through
here see which ones I have not read yet
and download it I cannot bear to have
any hair on my face I'm sunbathing or on
my neck so I'm gonna try and do that
really cool like Instagram or hairstyle
where they do a top knot and then they
use a scarf to keep the hair away
because I've got loads of like dead bits
where my hair is frazzled and coloring
so if I have like a scarf headband hope
you'll keep it all off my face I've
never tried this before so let's give it
a go
firstly gonna do a top nut and I always
use in busy bubbles I'm on holiday is
anything else just drags my hair too
much so I'm going to fold the scarf
first a little bit and then do I have
the bow down yeah
I mean how do the people in Instagram
make it look so cool and effortless I
feel like I just look like some kind of
funny maybe I should drop this okay I
think not as good as we're gonna get
definitely don't look quite as cool as
the Instagram girls but we've tried and
I think I'll do the trick keeping my
hair off my face hands up who else has
attempted an Instagram trend and epic
you think people don't feel like I can't
be alone in that let me know down below
if you've ever tried anything that
you've seen on Instagram and failed
miserably
but yeah this is gonna do let's get to
the beach this is the jungle route to
the beach we don't want to walk through
the restaurant with barely any clothes
on every single morning they have a team
of gardeners that come and sweep this
path so if you want to walk around
barefoot not going to try to make shells
or any twigs or anything this whole
island the main science is just
absolutely amazing so we're gonna go to
the quiet zone about you yeah the Sun is
literally like real perfectly idea than
most people's carpet yeah yeah it
definitely has left crap on it than most
people's carpets and so yeah we're gonna
go to the beach to the quiet zone I'm
gonna stick in my audible book and chill
out for a couple of hours I found this
on the floor so pretty
this one's grumpy because he just wants
to get to the beach and I keep stopping
him and asking for photos
so I've gone for Sophie Kinsella
Gatecrasher so it's time to tune in
after a lovely morning on the beach we
are now heading to Mandi which is quite
a healthy restaurant which is very close
to the overwater spa I will show you the
whole spa area because it I hope it's
beautiful and on the buggy which is
definitely the quickest way to get there
and we're actually changing rooms today
so we were as you saw staying in a water
buffalo but this afternoon moving to a
beach villa i've not seen inside of each
villa yet so i'm intrigued to see it and
i will show you guys around just waiting
for Charlie who's taken a long time to
get ready and then heading back to the
mandu spiral restaurant for lunch just
choosing what we're gonna have they've
actually collaborated with an Australian
blogger called Jessica temple and she's
a fitness and nutrition blogger and she
has designed one of the menus here so
you can either choose from her menu or
like a fire ice elements menu so I'm
gonna order from the Jessica Jas health
menu I've gone for a green detox of soup
and then a chicken and ginger stir fry
we actually ate here on our first night
and I had a chicken with pumpkin risotto
and it was the best thing I've ever
tasted so I am looking forward to this
in about 10 minutes or so out here they
are going to be doing some fish feeding
and we all get to see lots of little
reef sharks lots of fish so I'll show
you that in fact okay I'm gonna get the
green detox soup please and then the
ginger and chicken stir-fry
rafi what you just said darling I said
how amazing with the photo from above B
you got in there with them Lane like
this Charlie wants to get in there with
sharks there any spare any reach only
baby sharks though so it's okay to be
found here the danger would be the
neighbor mistake yeah probably not worth
it Brennan scrum shot down food bloggers
in action Charlie is photographing his
tuna starter and then I have got the
green detox soup sadly we've just had a
bit of a downpour but here in the
maldives rain only ever lasts a few
minutes before it's blown away to the
sunshine Bon Appetit and the main
courses have arrived this is my chicken
with ginger stir-fry how's your beef
timing looks amazing I had beef a couple
of nights ago at the sunset grill and it
was good and the rain is going just need
the clouds to shoot
you've been given our new room key and
we are in a beach villa this time we're
just about to check it out for the first
time so I'll give you guys a bit of a
room tour I think this is us in here our
stuff is already here oh my goodness
this is beautiful Wow Wow we have an
outdoor bathtub oh my goodness like a
jacuzzi this is amazing
Wow wow this is huge
the showers off oh my goodness this room
is epic
Wow I thought the water villas are cool
but this is seriously cool this is more
like kind of luxury hotel room whereas
the water villa is more Maldivian I
would say no the water villa Charlie
will be happy we've got an espresso I'm
not gonna lie the coolest bit it's
definitely this bathroom and there's a
mini toilet as well so cool look how
bright this is Wow
oh my goodness I'm gonna do a little bit
of unpacking I'll catch up with you guys
later and by the way everything that I'm
wearing and talking about in this vlog
will be linked down below including the
stress link down below link down below
okay so in the tub try not to show you
my booty and I'm gonna have a bit of a
pamper session as you can see I've got
my my face mask on this is the ESOP
parsley seed cleansing mask and then
we're going to use my red head totally
beachin after some shampoo and
conditioner this stuff is amazing and
godmother with Venus snap he's a really
good fun holiday and my body shop
exfoliating gloves so it's time to relax
oh and I'm gonna I'm also gonna put on
another audiobook because I've just got
to the end of a chapter in Sophie
Kinsella she tilted her head push to
hotel oh my goodness that was an epic
bath I feel turkey pampered I scrubbed
everything my deep conditioned I even
used my little petty thing to get rid of
any dry skin on my face too much
information I had my camera on my
tripods I couldn't see myself in the
screen so hopefully I didn't just flash
any
arms or boobs in that last shot and
that's my first shower pampering and let
me go through a few of my favorite
products so I use the pure ology perfect
for platinum this comes with me
everywhere it is literally the best
thing that ever happened to my hair
because I get my hair dyed so it can
break quite easily it can just be a
nightmare but this is just the best
thing to blonde hair if you struggle
with naughty nurse or your hair takes
forever to dry this is amazing if I use
that and then the weather system
professional luxe school the luxe oil
this is another favorite handy it's
quite small and this I just run through
the ends it smells amazing keeps my ends
from breaking keeps me in good condition
that stops any flyaways so those two I
just like my saviors when it comes to
have that noise in the background by the
way is D fumigating the island against
mosquitoes they go around every day like
four or five o'clock and D fumigate so
I've got the micellar micelle err oil
gel that I use in my face because I've
got the individual lashes on you have to
use something oil-free and this is an
oil-free Wiesler gel then I used a toner
and then I've used the Garnier on Reysol
err no streaks bronzer on my face
because I find that my body turns a lot
quicker than my face so by using this it
just means that my face keeps nice and
brown and then there's been at least I
have put the Palmer's coconut oil body
lotion on this is just again amazing for
holidays me and Charlie both absolutely
love it and maybe the natural coconut
oil so that's what I've got on my body
at the moment I'm gonna go and check out
the beach from our Villa now because I
haven't actually been outside the front
yet so let's go and how little it
freezing outside a little bit high on
the fielding you can't see too full girl
Charlie and I are heading out for dinner
now I've just been doing a little bit of
work at reception I did have a big fancy
blue dress on a second ago I'll insert a
photo that we took here but it was just
so much fabric and it is a very very
humid and hot evening so I've scraped my
hair back and popped on at the dress I
was wearing earlier today which I am
literally in love with perfect holiday
dress but I've smarted it up with some
makeup and also my fabulous little Chloe
bag which I love so much so I will
hopefully get to show you a proper
outfit of the day in a second we have
got dinner I think it's called oofah the
restaurant smack which is their Asian
cuisine we dined here when we were here
last year and it was delicious so I'm
looking forward to a nice excuse the
bomb site behind me but in case I don't
get a chance to show you later this is
what the dress looks like for length
it's just a beautiful tie detail at the
waist
it's got like a gap down here so it's
better if you don't wear a bra and it's
just very flattering how it's got the
tie at the waist and then there's lovely
kind of thrill detail down at the bottom
so big big fan as you can probably tell
smooth talker under pressure sweaty
palms ain't making it much better
we are in the flow restaurants which
we've just discovered that buffa means
happiness in Maldivian got a lovely
table in the restaurants on the beach I
am literally the happiest person in the
world right now because they have got
crispy Peking duck on the menu my
favorite foods so we're gonna order that
and a few different starters what are
you gonna go for those poached spinach
roll with snow crab necessity source
duck the duck yeah I'm exceptionally
excited I even bought some steam from
this fast starter Charlie's got the mint
flavor the hot dog very home and there's
also a red bean flavor and a plain one
and then we've got a passion fruit dip
yeah I said passion fruit puree olive
oil I'm gonna try a little bit of the
red bean oh yeah duck has arrived looks
amazing
Doris is gonna get his flat night when
we met about town get the shot going
back at the villa now and going to have
a bit of an early night so we had
delicious dinner at the Foofa restaurant
fabulous crispy duck probably one of the
best ducks I think I've ever had
actually very very tasty I'm gonna just
upload some pictures that we shot today

presets and get them exporting overnight
