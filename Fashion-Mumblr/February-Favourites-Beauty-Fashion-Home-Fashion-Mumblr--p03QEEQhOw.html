having a really really lovely day and
thank you for joining me for today's
video which is going to be my February
monthly favourites it actually feels
like forever ago that I filmed my
January favourites and I think that's
probably because this month was really
hectic it was obviously Fashion Week and
just seems to be that every single week
was like crazy full of meetings and
events and all that kind of fun stuff so
it does feel like forever ago that I sat
down and filmed my February January
favorites today I am going through a few
of my favorite products of February 2016
as well as a few favorite Browns
favorite experiences and also my new
category for 2016 which is my favorite
blog a mail item of 2016 if you guys
didn't see it already last Sunday I
published my opening of some bloggers
mail video which hopefully you will have
enjoyed watching
I definitely love watching those kind of
videos in such a nosy Parker and I
thought I would film one and show you
guys that I got in a few days worth or
weeks worth or so of bloggers mail
anyway I digress let's go on with my
favorite things after free so firstly a
relatively new addition to my makeup
collection and this is the lock
skinny-dip vibrant matte lipstick so
skinny-dip has nothing to do with the
case friends that you see the iPhone
cases and everything it's just called
that because this is a skinny-dip
product and lock or love of color is the
makeup brand by Birchbox and this
product in particular the vibrant matte
lipstick and I don't think it actually
has a shade it's just this kind of pinky
coral color I'm actually wearing it
right now so if you wonder what's on my
lips it's this and this is a mini crayon
and it's a gorgeous pink but I'd say
brownie pink but more on the pinky side
so I definitely have been loving these
brownie Pink's recently my amaretto by
lip crown of and just wearing to death
and this is a more spring girly pink I
love the texture of this it's very matte
on the lips without being drying I love
that it's so tiny it's just been in my
handbag with me everywhere and I just
think
color is absolutely gorgeous I hope you
guys like this color on me because I
love it
these I believe are eight pounds and
they also have eyes shadow sticks I do
think they are maybe slightly pricey
considering how teeny tiny they are but
it's very long-lasting so I consider
that this little tube of lipstick
goodness will hopefully last me quite a
long time another Beauty favorite is one
which I've been dying to tell you about
for so long but it's only just been kind
of announced and it's the Rimmel London
volume colorist mascara so this mascara
is such a genius invention basically you
guys will notice if you watched last
week's video but it basically slowly
tints your lashes so if you are like me
and you have really light lashes and you
like to get into before you go on
holiday just to mean that you don't eat
around mascara in the pool then you will
absolutely love this because over the
space of I've said been using this for
about four weeks now it has slowly but
surely tinted my blonde lashes so they
are very very dark not quite black yet
but I'd no longer have those pale wispy
ends to my lashes which makes my naked
lashes look a lot bolder so this is I
believe coming out early March so not
too long to wait and I think it's like
$7.99 eight pounds but the fact that it
colors your lashes and isn't amazing
mascara I just think is so so amazing so
been loving using that this month and
then keeping on the theme of eyes I have
this incredibly beautiful palette from
Tarte
via QVC and it's their ring first of the
see I shadow palette now you guys might
remember that I fell in love like at the
end of last year with my stealer eyes
shadow palette and this is actually
pretty similar shapes but the packaging
I mean ah it's just absolutely stunning
but these are all the kind of shades
that I wear on a really regular basis
they've got really lovely kind of
tropical names as well like starfish
reef Cove sand mermaid and they are just
the most beautifully wearable shapes
they all have a light shimmer to them
which I really really like and I just
words can't describe my love for these
colors every single color in here I've
been wearing like
on a daily basis I just oh they're just
so stunning I I don't have enough words
to tell you how beautiful these
eyeshadows are texture-wise they're
really gorgeous I mean tart you guys
know is an incredible brand they are
very heavily pigmented so you don't need
that much it barely looks like I've
touched this and then there's a huge big
mirror on the lid as well so really
great for doing your makeup out and
about and I mean just look at it it's
absolutely stunning so as I mentioned it
was Fashion Week this month um last week
or week or so ago and to get my makeup
stain all throughout the day without
budging I relied solely on the L'Oreal
infallible fixing mist now this when I
first tried it made my face go all white
and splattery but you definitely have to
shake this quite heftily before you put
it on your face because you can see the
kind of chalky and powder sinking to the
bottom if you don't so if you miss if
you mix this up really well and
sometimes I find it sprays quite big
droplets so what I like to do is I like
to miss the air and then very quickly
walk into that cloud of fixing spray
mist and that just worked an absolute
treat during the freshmen kick you from
my makeup stuck in place throughout the
day I did still tend to get shiny and
that's just what happens to my skin I
did take a powder with me but you know
fashion week you don't really have much
time to stop and fix up your makeup so
this just meant that I didn't need to
touch on my makeup too much other than
the powder and kept everything looking
fresh throughout the day so this was
really really great for fashion week and
I'll be continuing to use this on days
when I won't be having too much free
time like if I've got a day of meetings
and things like that or any events and
it's the budget but registry to budget
product it's the high street product
obviously Urban Decay have one as well
which i think is almost double the price
so highly recommend this if you are in
the market for a makeup setting or
fixing spray and before I finish up on
the makeup I wanted to give an overall
shout out to my favorite brand or
February 2016 and it has to be gallon so
I think I mentioned last month the
I have never really tried that much
gallon before I tried a bronzer I think
it was probably one of my first like
designer makeup purchases but that was
really the only thing I tried and even
that was like long gone when I started
blogging but this month I just really
fell in love with so many of their
products this here is their Terracotta
Four Seasons bronzer so you can see it's
got if I can get into it you can see
it's got four shades in the desc lighter
shades going around to a darker shade so
you can really kind of use a smaller
brush on the dark shade to get a bit of
contour or swipe your brush all the way
around for a lovely very very
natural-looking bronzer and then there's
their meteorites
primer which I featured in my luxury new
in video I think I raved about it then
just it's beauty with a little pearl
drops and that I actually have a makeup
routine video coming up very soon
including this and you'll see what a
lovely glow it adds to the skin I've got
on today just basically been using this
every single day and as a whole just the
brand that's just absolutely beautiful
there and there's another product here
which is their eye shadow in a gorgeous
nude color this is just perfect for
those days and I don't actually want one
to wear eye shadow but don't want to
have naked oops the brush is falling out
don't want to have a naked eyelet so
this is a very close shade to my natural
eyelid shades are great for those and no
makeup makeup days and then again the
meteorites powder which again I showed
you my luxury moon video just absolutely
stunning for really adding a very fresh
glow to the face
it's mattifying but there are a few
shiny areas on this little sparkly
sections so you can add a little a bit
of a bit of a healthy glow to the skin
as well so overall just been absolutely
loving Galen as I said I'm doing a
makeup lip video I'm including a load of
their products by students are keeping
the captain full of that it's going to
be an everyday kind of glowy makeup look
a product which really took me by
surprise as a month I wasn't expecting
to love it as much as I did it's the Mel
Vita Rose oh it's kind of all in Spanish
rose faced care oils so this I've been
using before my moisturizer in the
mornings just adding a couple of drops
of this and when it said oil I was kind
of expecting that kind of oil which just
sits on the skin for quite a long time
I wasn't expecting to be as blown away
by this as I was basically it's a really
really light oil so it sinks into the
skin within a matter of moments smells
heavenly and I just feel like it's a
really lovely pampering treat for the
skin before you apply your makeup in the
mornings it's a brand that I've never
really incorporated that much into my
daily routine before but after falling
so much in love with this I think I'll
be putting a lot more or trying a lot
more of their products and seeing if I
can fit any more into my daily routine
and last but not least on the beauty
side of things is the new viva la juicy
yep just checking I was right rose a
perfume and this very nearly got my
favorite blogger mail of the Month award
favorite position because it came with
an absolutely amazing bottle of pink
sparkly rose a which I just absolutely
love I still have the bottle even though
the Rose a is long gone but the perfume
itself is absolutely heavenly so I love
anything floral and Rosie I absolutely
loved the original Viva La Juicy perfume
in the gold bottle that very swiftly
became my everyday perfume so
long-lasting such a strong scent a
couple of mists and all day people would
be asking me what perfume I was wearing
and they wouldn't believe me when I said
it was a Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy but
this is even better it's just gorgeous
packaging I love the pink and sparkly of
course they do
and it's just more of a floral twist but
still very warm and surprisingly mature
for a bottle that's pink and sparkly
with a bow on it but I just think this
is gonna become my new everyday perfume
and I've been loving it throughout the
month of February it's even got a little
rose a bottle with Diamonds inside it on
the lips so this is absolutely gorgeous
both outside and in and a couple of
accessory favorite so firstly my key
sunglasses these rose gold kind of laser
patterned sunglasses not really too sure
how to best describe these but if you
watched or saw my London Fashion Week
diary posts on the blog I didn't outfit
of the day post for every single David I
was at Fashion Week I think I pretty
much wore these every day you guys know
I absolutely love rose gold
and I really love cat eye sunglasses I
think the shape of cat eye sunglasses is
the shape that suits me the best I look
a bit stupid wearing them indoors and
these where I think like 25 pounds got
these from Topshop but I don't need
they're available from Topshop anymore
so I'll see if I can find a link for
these to are online and leave that below
because they definitely think I'll be
wearing these a lot more as it hopefully
starts to get a bit sunnier and my final
product favorite also an accessory is
this beautiful ring now this is from a
brand called carat London and it's a
rose gold ring with very intricate kind
of almost floral ingenue floral design
covered in tiny 'lest gems and then
three bigger gems in the middle I just
think it's such an elegant design a
really big ring but because it's flat
against my hand I really don't feel that
I'm wearing it so I instantly feel more
dressed up and glamorous when I have
this on my hand again Wallace all
throughout Fashion Week so you might
have seen in my it's really hard to show
your luck finding a flattering hand
angle so you might have seen this again
in my London Fashion Week outfit posts
to absolutely adore this I have matching
earrings and a matching necklace and a
matching bracelet to this as well I got
a little bit carried away on the Kara
London rose gold front but yeah so they
are my favorite products of February
2016 and as I did last month my favorite
blogger mail item of February 2016
there's really no two ways about it I
got so excited when I saw an onion in
Marshall homage depending on hi say I
say too much um carry a bag arrived at
my Pierre box not like never Shirley not
really not um but I was invited to a few
London Fashion Week shows backstage and
to the shows by L'Oreal including any
hemorrhage and L'Oreal very kindly sent
me this absolutely beautiful and your
hair Marsh makeup bag so it's a
transparent makeup bag which makes it so
perfect for traveling it's got these two
sections in it which say touch down and
take off and inside of a second fit on
my beauty products for when I'm out and
about
these gorgeous little tassel with zip
closures and I just think this is going
to be such a practical bag and I'm going
to get so much use out of this inside
there were a few L'Oreal hair products
including my absolute favorite which is
the mystic oil which is just so great if
you have slightly drier ends or you need
just a little bit of help when comb
through the ends and also a mythic oil
shampoo mini which I haven't tried yet
but it's the perfect size for putting in
any travel bag as well I'm excited to
try this next time I wash my hair and
there are a few other larger items in
there as well but I've already put them
all away my hair cupboard so certainly
can't show you but honestly this is just
so so so generous I know that onion wash
is such a gorgeous brand and I've only
ever been able to afford a notebook from
there before so just so incredible to
have an any home wash makeup bag so
thank you L'Oreal I feel like the
luckiest girl in the whole world so
pretty I actually just found one more
product which I wanted to mention in my
favorites probably not the most
glamorous of products but one which I
think is gonna save me a lot of time and
money in the future and it's the ayodhya
brow kit so this kit you may have seen
me testing it out on my snapchat I did a
first impressions on snapchat did a
whole story of me experimenting there
dying my eyebrows at home basically
you'll normally get my eyebrows done a
benefit they tint them and then shape
them for me but last month I missed it
so I couldn't go around with half
eyebrows so I decided to use this at
home kit and it was super duper easy I
was slightly worried that I wouldn't be
able to do it because I wasn't very good
at like reading the instructions but it
was so easy and I was really really
pleased with the results in fact a few
of you guys tweeted me afterwards saying
that you went out and bought it after
seeing me do it on snapchat so you
obviously thought that you Vyasa do it
as well
so really pleased with this and I think
I will definitely be continuing to use
this in the future last but not least I
know I said that on the last one but I
just saw this hanging on my bed frame
and I forgot to mention it I have this
gorgeous
dachshund tea towel from Anthropologie
again it's something that I showed you
guys on my snapped
I should I buy it and I was shopping
with Dexter at the time and everyone was
like yes you need to buy that but it's
yes from anthropology and it says
darling and dak sentence on the bottom
which I just think is absolutely
gorgeous it's got little Dexter's all
over it and some blonde sausage dogs as
well so yeah this has pride of place in
our kitchen it's actually got a little
bit of avocado at the moment we've
obviously been putting it to good use
but yeah I thought I would have to
mention this in my monthly favourites
says flippy floppy ears and stitching I
think it's by a brand called yeah poppy
trophy you know how they have like
independent designers and everything at
Anthropologie so I thought I would throw
that in for good measure because it's
just made my day it makes me smile every
time I see it in the kitchen and that
actually is it a little bit jumpy here
and there but we've got through it those
are my favorite products of February
2016 hope you guys enjoyed looking
through those with me definitely leave
me a little note in the comment what
your favourite products were for this
month so I'd love to know you guys have
been loving as well if any of these
