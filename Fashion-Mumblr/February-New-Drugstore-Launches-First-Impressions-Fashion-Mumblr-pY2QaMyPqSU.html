joining me for today's video happy
Valentine's Day if you're watching this
on the day that it goes live I'm in a
different place today I'm not in a
different place I'm in my house but I'm
in my new chinese bedroom instead of the
room next door where I usually do my
filming just because that room is a
total and utter bomb site so hope you
don't mind the new surroundings I am NOT
okay with the lighting in this video
I've got my usual spotlight either side
and I see so many youtubers being like
oh I'm sorry for the lighting and
actually their lighting is perfect but I
feel like today it's just a little bit
harsh it's raining outside and I feel
like the lighting is just not doing my
face shape any favours do you know what
I mean like it's just round I'm like the
moon I don't know anyway so today I
thought I would talk to you about some
new end products from the drugstore from
boots from super drug all those kinds of
places I've done in you in videos before
and they've gone done really well you
guys seem to really like them but I do
tend to get carried away and in the past
I think they've been about half an hour
long so I really didn't want to do that
this time I thought you know what I'm
just going to choose like four or five
of my favorite launches and I'm going to
whittle it down even more by just doing
the drugstore so that's what today's
video is going to be but also there are
so many lovely lovely pieces I've been
launched on the luxury side of things so
I'm also going to do a new in luxury
version of this video which I'm probably
going to put up on Wednesday so if
that's your thing then definitely check
out Wednesday's video so as I said I
don't want this video to be super long
so I'm gonna get cracking and I have
only got maybe four or five things which
are launching or have launched in the
drugstore this month and the first one
that I wanted to tell you about is
actually a range so not just a product
but a new range and I actually went to a
L'Oreal pop-up in Soho this week and got
a blow dry done by them in fact this is
day three of the blow dry so still not
looking too bad um and basically L'Oreal
L vivre are launching a new range called
extraordinary clay and I don't think
I've ever really
and a new haircare launch in a new end
video before just because nothing's
really been so amazing that it's kind of
warranted mentioning like there are so
many things I love using on my hair but
this I thought was really exciting
launch firstly because it's got clay in
it and I love clay my skincare routine
I love playing masks but I never would
have considered putting play in my hair
before and what this does as I learnt at
the pop-up is that the clay basically
absorbs any excess oils and prevents
oils or like you know the kind of sebum
that your yes a little bit gross but
basically at the top of your hair can be
a little bit oily and the ends can we
try this is a problem that quite a lot
of girls and definitely myself suffer
from and the clay just helps to regulate
that out so this is a pre-shampoo
treatment this is the main the main
product that I'm really impressed with
in the range and it basically you apply
it before you shampoo onto dry hair just
onto the scalp and it really helps to
absorb all those excess oils so I don't
know about you but sometimes when I wash
my hair even when it's freshly washed
and I blow-dry it it's still really like
heavy up here and you can kind of just
like feel like there's loads of products
whereas after my L'Oreal blow-dry with
the new lb of clay I really didn't feel
that it was so light in fact I've logged
a vlog with blow dries so I will link
that flock down below if you want to see
my my first impressions but this is out
now in Superdrug on the boots I do
believe and probably online as well so
I'll leave links down below to this I
just thought for a relatively
inexpensive treatment this did such a
good job and it's so nice to see the
cheaper side of a range doing the
innovation instead of it just going use
the super expensive ranges and then
filtering down so really liking this
first impressions are really good and
I'm looking forward to adding this into
my maybe weekly haircare pamper routine
sticking with l'oreal but away from hair
care and on to makeup they have created
a new range with the L'Oreal infallible
sculpt iris struggling to hold orders
and then put it down and basically they
teamed up with makeup by Mario for an
incredible launch event a couple of
weeks ago which I was really good I
missed because of flight delays coming
back from Costa Rica but they launched
this new makeup range which is all about
contouring and just sculpting every part
of your makeup routine I actually did a
little first impressions of all of these
products over on my snapchats so
definitely make sure you are filling me
on snapchat if you want to see me kind
of like opening up bloggers mail and try
things out with the very first time
there's basically like my genuine first
impressions so I'll leave my snapchat
details here so you don't follow me if
that's kind of thing that you like to
see and also opening up lots different
packages and but the first thing that I
tried from the range was this and it's a
new L'Oreal infallible sculpt foundation
this is available now and it's $8.99
which is a very kind of average price
for a drugstore foundation what I loved
about this and I've got to say that my
skin is really strange at the moment
it's quite a combination it can be dry
it can be oily but this I found went
onto my skin really really easily
blended super quickly which is exactly
what you want you just don't want to be
spending hours with a buffing brush or
anything and it gave a really lovely
flawless base so the kind of base that
you really want to have if you are going
to do some contouring because it just
gives you a really even place to start
the next thing that I tried out was this
and it is the infallible sculpt -
contouring palette - in one highlight
and contour
now inside you get a two different
shades in cream formats I think they
have a medium and a light shade not sure
if they have a dark perhaps I just
wasn't sent that one because it would be
much too dark for my skin but previously
I've been a little bit phobic of cream
contours and I've always feared that
they're going to make my face look a
dirty and therefore just worse and if I
didn't put anything on so I went quite
lightly with this and I found it was
very buildable which of course is great
if you're not necessary
most confident when it came to
contouring and I used not sure we just
said this I use my Real Techniques
contour brush just to slowly build it up
and I did find that it was very easy to
do so impressed with just the ease and
the fact that it didn't make my face
look dirty and I think it's great if you
are kind of a contouring beginner and
you just don't want anything too bold
the highlight color as well is nice and
sheer so really good for just building
up a lovely contour but not going too
crazy if it is your first time I then
tried the blusher and I was quite
overwhelmed with how strong this came
out on the brush I wasn't expecting a
drugstore blusher to have quite a
smoking much pigment so I did end up
looking like very rosy cheeked when I
first tried this this is the shade 102
nude beige I have got another couple
somewhere but this was definitely okay
here we go there's a more of a girly
pink one this is 201 soft rosy but the
nude beige was the one that I found just
seemed to go best with my skin tone very
bendable again very sheer very buildable
but I would beware of overloading your
brush definitely tap it off and maybe
tested a little bit on your wrist before
you got into a face because as I said
the color payoff of this is pretty
incredible this is going to be $7.99
which i think is maybe a little bit
pricey for a blush although you do have
those nice three shades in there and it
did last a very long time some drugstore
blushes I finally look in there a couple
of hours later and you can't really tell
you for anything on whereas this
definitely stood the test of time so
when I opened up this which is the
L'Oreal infallible scold brow artist up
on snapchat I was just very amazed that
it has such a strange-looking nib I'm
not sure if you can see this but the
applicator is really really quite um it
looks quite angry I don't really know
how to describe it
but basically you use the pointy part of
it to fill in any gaps and then the
brush to really shape the arch and add a
little bit of volume a can even back
home in a little bit I have to say I do
prefer pencil to this kind of applicator
just because I like to fill in the
individual brow hairs and make it
because though I've drawn in actual
hairs whereas this is good if you
already have a really good solid shape
but you just want to add a little bit
more depth to the brow I think I would
probably spend a little bit more and get
the pencil and the brow gel just because
I feel like this is almost trying to be
too clever and doing a little bit too
much but I mean that's just for my brows
but if you just want to have a little
bit more color and shape then definitely
worth a try also in the infallible
sculpt collection is a mascara and an
eyeliner but I'm gonna Wiz over those
and instead just finish by telling you
about these which are the new infallible
matte Mac's I think it's the named lip
powders so these give a matte finish to
your lips like a matte lipstick would
but instead of having like oil and wax
ingredients they are powder which does
mean that they are not so drying on the
lips because they are literally just
applied onto your lips and there's no
ingredients that suck out the moisture
and they have really good lasting power
I used a nude color yesterday actually I
popped it on 8 o'clock in the morning I
had breakfast I had coffee and then at
the end of lunch I checked my makeup and
it was still in place so really
impressed with the lasting power I think
for $6.99 these are incredible value and
the shade selection is really lovely
they've got a nude as I said and a
fuchsia a purple a bright red so I'm
really looking forward to try a few more
colors of the matte max lip powders so
this next launch is something that I'm
really excited about and I'm wearing
them right now and it's a range of new
pre-glued eyelashes from earlier and
these are called they're expressed by
earlier lashes I think there are eight
different types and they're out now
exclusively to super drug and as I said
pre-glued lashes which means they're
super duper quick and easy to apply
I find the longest part of applying
lashes is when you have two really
fiddly kind of draw on the glue and then
wait for it to semi set before you apply
it resist has got a new formulation
of glue already on the lashes so all you
have to do is trim them to shape and
then apply honestly it took me less than
a minute to do both lashes whereas I'd
say previously and take me about five
minutes in total to do both so I can
definitely confirm that they are very
quick and easy you guys know me I'm
already a huge fan of I new lashes so
the fact that they have made them so
quick and easy to do is just really
fantastic for me I do like to wear
lashes quite regularly if there's any
kind of special occasion like I've got
them on to take some filming and then
going out to cinema Charlie later I know
it's dark and I'm very wearing 3d
glasses but hey ho I just love to wear
them and I just think that the fact that
mean is so easy means I'm wearing these
a hell of a lot more there's so many
types of lashes ranging from really
really natural ones I mean this is
really barely there so if you just want
to add a little bit more definition to a
daytime look and then you've got some
really lengthening ones to give a really
fluttery kind of doe eyed look got some
beautiful bold ones and some very
texturized ones as well so really a lash
to cover every type of lash preference
what kind of society is this that we
have lash preferences I mean it's
getting pretty crazy but I'm definitely
not going to complain and these
apparently have 15 hour plus wear so
I've worn lashes for many many hours in
the past I'm not sure 15 hours but I
will wear these to the rest of the day
and let you know how I get on the next
launch that I wanted to tell you about
is one that I got really really excited
about and this is the new batiste sweet
and delicious dry shampoo so it's just a
normal dry shampoo but the reason why
I'm so excited about it is because it
has lovehearts on the tin and yeah I
don't know if that's another reason to
get excited about something but I have a
bit of an obsession with love hearts if
you watched my 50 facts about me video
you'll know that when I was younger I
used to make jewelry that look like
sweeties so if you can hear my phone
going off it's kind of email pinging
just turn on silent and yeah I used to
make jewelry that look like sweeties and
I used to make love heart bracelets so
it's a bit of a deja vu blast from the
past and I really like batiste dry
shampoo so I thought I'd give that a
quick mention this is
out in superdrug and probably boots as
well now another launch which I think I
also vlogged the launch event is the new
spring/summer collection from REM so
Brian posted a really lovely afternoon
tea at the ivy with Lucy Mecklenburgh
from TOWIE who is their new kind of face
of the brand and what they did was they
just posed a lovely tea and we could
look at the new collection they have a
new contour palette they have new
eyeshadow palettes they just were
launching all the new products but what
I got most excited about was a new range
of sunset day like carrying nail
varnishes you guys probably know that
I'm already a huge fan of this range I
nearly always have that lovely deep
burgundy color on my toes and but I just
needed to show you guys in this color
because it is the perfect Barbie pink
I'm surprised I didn't have it on my
nails at the moment because I've been
wearing it so much recently and I just
love that they've made it not just part
of their normal range for a part of
their sunset range because this if you
aren't already aware basically it's like
gel but without any need for UV this
topcoat when used with the rest of the
sunset day like to curing range makes
your nails last for a really long time
lovely pie gloss but without the faff of
putting on and taking off gel nail
varnish love the packaging as well just
really gorgeous colors with rose gold
lids and you guys know me and my love
for rose gold so hard to tell you about
that the rest of our range is beautiful
but this has got to be my favorite new
launch before their spring/summer
collection and last but not least I
wanted to tell you a little bit about
this which is a new Beauty launched from
clean and clear so clean and clear I
used to use when I was younger when I
was suffering from breakouts but I kind
of haven't really thought about them for
a little while since the skin has been
getting a bit better but when they
launched this I just actually had to try
it and it's basically a tinted
moisturizer which has all these
ingredients in it which really work to
unclog the skin it doesn't get some
makeup and it doesn't clog up the pores
when you wear it and it has spot
fighting ingredients which for me just
takes so many boxes even when you're a
little bit older when you're out of like
the teenage years you can still get
congested skin in fact I did a whole
video on
what I do and I do have bad skin I
particularly suffer from congestion
around the jawline but what I have been
doing on those days and I've been
working from home
it's just applying this so I don't feel
quite so scary I don't escape myself
when I look in the mirror it does give a
lovely amount of coverage maybe not
quite enough for when I go out and I
filmed within my bare skin routine video
more of a going-out kind of makeup look
but if you just wanted to cover up a few
of your blemishes maybe for school or on
those days when you don't want to full
makeup look then I have just been
absolutely loving using this recently I
think it's so good that finally there's
a product out there that really does
help to heal the spots as well as
covering them up so a really good
multitasking product clean and clear I
mean you guys probably everyone's
probably used clean and clear in the
past and you can trust when it comes to
spot fighting so I thought I'd give that
a little mention and just because I
think it's such a really really useful
product and one that works so hurrah and
so that's it that is my little selection
of new end products for the drugstore
for the month of February all of these
as far as I'm aware are out and
available to find now so I will leave
links down below if I can find any other
drugstore links normally quite hard to
find and I hope you've enjoyed this
video don't forget to check out
Wednesday's if you'd like to see some
beautiful new products which have been
bought out on the slightly more
higher-end side of things because there
are so many gorgeous ones and don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up if
you've enjoyed it and I know that I've
only covered like a few here so
definitely leave me a comment if you've
tried anything from the drugstore
recently which is a new favorite or a
new launch because I'd love to know you
guys are loving at the moment so that's
all from me I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
