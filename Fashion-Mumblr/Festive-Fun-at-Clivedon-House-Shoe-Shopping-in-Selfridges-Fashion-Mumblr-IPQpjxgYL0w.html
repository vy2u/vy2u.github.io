all our friends are jealous of us so
girl kick your feet up soak in the
summer love feeling like cat falls they
come this fall if we break hey guys and
welcome to a pre blog most vlogs I feel
I would vlog for the next couple of days
I'm going to do a two day vlog because
I've come to Cleveland house with
Pandora and we're going to have a very
festive weekend so I thought I would
bring you along with me so first of all
this morning we've got a wreath making
class and some more festive activities
so let's go inside and get started
you
first activity of mine there's extreme
gift-wrapping like we're learning all
the tools of the trade how to either
repeal think a trafficker be here's my
finished result so I might do another
mini video on this because I think it's
really useful but the tips are folding
your edges so they're super neat
double-sided sticky tape is an absolute
must and I just learned a very sneaky
tip on bow ties so stay tuned to find
out how to tie the perfect bow so just
take a moment to appreciate how
beautiful this kitchen is I'm going to
save this clip for pair to a future
builder and my training article subway
tile I'll be studying flew over a sheet
sorry Jay
so we have been suited and booted with
some lovely jewels jacket and wellies
and now we're going to take a nice brisk
country walk through the grounds and
going back to keygen house for a festive
lunch
it's a little bit late now and we've had
a delicious festive lunch and now we're
back in spring cottage and we are doing
our wreath making now it's just so cozy
in here a big fire in the background and
this place just have to be stunning I
just love to spend Christmas somewhere
this cozy let's see how it looks
it's a little bit later on now and we've
just finished doing our wreath making
and I didn't really found too much of
the wreath making because it was very
dark by the time we got started but I'm
pretty proud of my wreath so I'll show
you in a second starting to feel very
festive now that we've made our mate our
beads done are wrapping so yes a really
lovely festive morning and we've now
just come to our rooms here in the main
building of Clevedon house and this is
my room so it's very grand big living
area behind me I've got a desk a little
lounge area and then a beautiful big
fireplace then you go through these
doors and into my bedroom so it's just
such a big beautiful old national trust
house and I was really interested to
find out about the history of this place
but luckily and they've actually given
us a book all about the history on our
beds so I'm gonna have a little flick
through that but Pandora have also put a
few other goodies on the bed so let's
have a little look at what we've got Hey
such lovely treats we've got a fluffy
hot water bottle there's a really
beautiful blanket some fluffy socks
perfect to go with my new wellies which
I'm not wearing and let's see what's in
here
could be a mug or something let's have a
look I'm a fridge water yes let's see
what's inside oh that is absolutely
adorable look at that personalized Emma
bridgewater mug is so pretty and then
this is the tales of the mistresses of
Clevedon very interesting and this box
says hush on it so I'm not sure what's
in here let's have a look dun dun dun Oh
what is it
hush chocolate oh it's chocolate and
then I think this might be a pair of
socks or hand warmers don't really know
but they feel very soft so I think we've
got just over an hour to relax before
dinner
I'm going to take my makeup off and just
do a little bit of work I think relax in
my beautiful room I think there's a team
machines somewhere I might make myself a
cup of coffee and then a half past seven
we'll meet him for dinner
you
good morning everybody it's Tuesday
morning and I just had the best night's
sleep in my ginormous bed here at
clevedon we had such a good night last
night we all had a really lovely festive
dinner downstairs in this beautiful
dining room I had beef wellington
I had a burrata and beetroot starter and
then a delicious like pineapple parfait
for desserts a really really fabulous
evening and we also did a Secret Santa
with Pandora gifts and wearing a little
Pandora dressing gown it's just so
adorable and Camilla who is just so
lovely she chose or she was my Secret
Santa and she got me this absolutely
beautiful necklace I'll show you a
close-up of it and it's one of their new
ones it's like a locket and you can
choose what charms you put in it so
she's chosen a little star like an angel
and an angel wing which is good timing
because it's a Victoria's Secret Show
coming soon so all getting really
excited to see that but yeah it's just
absolutely stunning I don't own much
silver jewelry but she actually layered
her jewelry like silver and gold so I'm
going to give that a try um I'm actually
going to pack my suitcase up now because
I'll show you the view behind me in a
second but basically I watched the Sun
Rise over the main house and it was so
stunning and I'm just desperate to go
out there and take some photos so I'm
gonna pack up so don't need to come back
up to the room
go downstairs meet some of the girls for
breakfast and then do some photos and
I'm going to carry on this vlog just for
the rest of the day I think because I do
have a pretty fun day planned which is
staying here in - about 11:00 and I'm
going back to London and I'll just take
you along with me if there are something
so time for a little update I'm afraid I
didn't vlog too much this morning I've
really been very bad I'm so sorry I
promise bloodless will not be like this
but back in London now as you can
probably see can't really see the Sun in
my face but yeah back in London now and
I am about to go to Selfridges for a
meeting and also I'm going to be picking
out a Cal designer shoes for the party
season so I thought I would take you
shopping with me and I'm thinking maybe
Gucci or Valentino but who knows
feelings Fendi and yeah then I'm just
gonna head home luckily I've only got my
suitcase with me because the e-pandora
girls kindly said they're going to post
the rest of stuff back to me cuz I had
wellies I had bags I had so much stuff
so she's got my suitcase with me the one
meeting a bit of shopping and then it's
back home for busy afternoon of work
you
yeah
just got back home and I appear to have
a rainbow on my face
Oh after my fabulous shopping a trip
with collection I'm going to show you
the new collection collection in a
second because it's very sparkly and
festive and I'm also going to show you
what I picked up because it's rather
fabulous um I wasn't really planning on
buying a pair of shoes today but I saw
these ones and I've been wearing my
Valentino rock studs a lot recently
they're pretty much my only designer
pair of shoes that I wear um for like
smart occasions so I thought I would
slash out and get a different version or
a different pair of shoes for you know
glamorous evening occasion so I'll show
you what I picked up feeling a little
bit carsick actually because I was doing
work on the bus I was going I was going
through my emails using my laptop on
personal hotspot and oh my god I think a
cat just jumped from a really high roof
in front of the window either that or
was a very fat bird I'm rambling because
I feel carsick and don't know what to do
as myself and but yeah I've just come
home I thought Charlie was going to be
here but he's not he's obviously been to
Dahl although because there's some
bloggers now here for me including don't
know what this is but it's beautifully
wrapped look how gorgeous that is so I'm
going to have a little flick through
that I've just put a kettle on I'm going
to make myself some pasta didn't really
have lunch today and I feel like
breakfast was a million and million
hours ago um so yeah let me quickly show
you what I bought from Selfridges here
they are so this is my very first pair
of Jean Vito Rossi shoes I've heard
amazing things about them and as soon as
I saw these they're such my kind of
color and yeah hopefully I'll be able to
wear them a lot for evening dews and
summer weddings because as I'm sure
you'll agree
you're a very versatile color let's just
open it up so I've got this little dust
bag which is really good storage and
then Sam Sam done
come on get in here they are all
beautifully wrapped up I'm just going to
get one out and show you properly
how beautiful are these so they've got
this perspex side which makes them fit
really snugly to your feet and also
makes them very very comfortable because
they just fit so well the back is like
this beautiful blush suede definitely my
kind of color and then at the point is a
rose gold leather which is just I can't
even imagine a more perfect pair of
shoes to me I honestly wasn't really
expecting to fall in love with you so
much I went in thinking maybe I'd get
some Gucci boots but came out with these
and a fairly good price for designer
shoes as well and I have heard from a
lot of well trusted sources that they're
really comfortable so I'm so excited to
wear these let me know what you guys
think in the comments down below of my
new little treats so I also got
introduced to the new Christmas
collection or some latest releases from
collections let me show you
oh this color oh my god I feel like it
goes with the shoes so perfect this is
this is a really good formula so this is
a two-step solar gel shot in and this
almost gives the effect of shellac
because it really does give a very
glossy shine and almost like a 3d color
on your nail so I'm going to redo my
nails with those later on this afternoon
this is just a gorgeous eyeshadow
palette you guys have heard me raving
about these in the past this one is
quite a cool tone one and I feel like
I'm going to switch it up a little bit
for Christmas this year I normally go
with golds and bronzes but that's a
really different color palette for me
and it's because they're so affordable
it's a great way of trying out some new
colors then they're lip liners which you
didn't even know that they did but they
are scroll up as opposed to sharpening
so I feel like that's just going to be
so handy and I adore that color and
they're so soft as well and then we've
got a retouch stick this is like a
lining concealer under the eyes these
are just the most fabulous glitters I
tried them on the back of my hand during
the meeting and they are so sparkly I
cannot wait to create some Christmas
sparkly eyes with those oops
then we've got some bold red lips a
couple of different formulas to try I
mean everyone loves a red lip during the
festive season and these are just two
really beautiful flattering shades then
we've got their creamy concealer which
is the lasting perfection and as far as
drugstore concealers go I would say this
is definitely in my top three if not my
favorite and finally they're kind of
chubby stick a shimmer highlighter which
I've not tried yet so really looking
forward to giving this one a go so
that's my fabulous new pair of shoes
what a lovely way to round off a very
fabulous couple of days so I actually
think I'm going to end this vlog here
because I'm just gonna do some vlog
fighters right now at home I've got to
pack for Zurich tomorrow which you guys
