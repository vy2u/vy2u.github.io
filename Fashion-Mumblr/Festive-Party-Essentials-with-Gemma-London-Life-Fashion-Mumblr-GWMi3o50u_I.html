seriously or fulfill this whole video
release on a Philip Nocona get the
output hi guys and welcome to my festive
party essentials video it is Christmas
party season well and truly upon us and
there are parties pretty much every week
right now for me at Lisa's Christmas
work parties friend parties just loads
of festive things going on house parties
you name it they are happening so I
thought quite fun and maybe potentially
quite a useful video would be top 10
festive party essentials ranging from
fashion and beauty and some other random
little snippets thrown in there as well
this video is a collab with my gorgeous
friend Gemma from this London Life Gemma
is filming the exact same video she's
putting together her top 10 party
essentials so you need to click around
this general area here to go and watch
her video I haven't seen what Gemma's
included in hers so I'm gonna be
watching that right after this I'll
leave all her information down below so
you can go and check out a channel if
you haven't done so already so I'm gonna
kick off with beauty products because
that's what I want to do and I'm gonna
start with long lasting lipsticks so to
me on a Christmas party you just don't
really want to be worrying about your
lipstick either looking rubbish or
vanishing altogether so a long-lasting
lipstick is definitely a festive
essential I've chosen three of my
favourite long lasting lipsticks in a
very festive red color first of all this
is the Estee Lauder lip potion it's the
pure color envy lip potion in shade
three-30 which is lethal red I'm
actually wearing this right now on top
of a slightly darker Topshop lip pencil
it's got a lovely day foot applicator
and it is a stain but it's a very high
intensity stain so it really does
deliver a full red lip not the gloss
that it does look like a gloss but
actually delivers a really intense red
lip I think I wore it in a previous
video so I'll link that video
down low so you can see what the slips
like on its own but this is a lovely
high-end
option on the drugstore end of the scale
you cannot beat Rimmel provoke ellipse
just checking out sweat is such a cool
yeah ring will provoke ellipse 16 hour
kiss proof lip color now kiss proof it
may be but either way this is actually
like a tattoo for your lips the color is
absolutely gorgeous but this end is
quite drying so luckily they have kind
of a moisturizing balm slash I think
it's kind of like a varnish which keeps
it really in place but yeah through a
drugstore option you cannot beat the
Rimmel provoke ellipse if you are really
into your high-end makeup then the best
super high-end version in my opinion is
this one from Chanel I'm not sure what
the actual name is this says just as
gloss not very informative but this to
me is just the most Christmasy read and
it's also similar to the Rimmel it's got
the gloss on the other end and when it
says gloss this is super duper high
shine and incredibly long-lasting high
shine so if you love a really bright old
red lip but you want it to be a little
bit glossy as well and lasts all night
then this is the one for you next up is
eyes and I think Christmas is a time of
year when you can go bold on the eyes
and the lips so I've chosen some lovely
glittery products here let's start with
the drugstore options and these are two
pops of a death in accord Azal dust no
glitter rush they actually says body
glitter but I've been sticking these on
my eyes and these are from Barry M I've
got the copper version and the white
version both of which are just super
easy to add on top of any existing I
look I might do a little tutorial with
these just because the impact is just so
incredible I particularly I particularly
love the copper one and I just and
sometimes I put a little bit of Vaseline
on my eyelid or like even just a lip
balm and it really helps to stick this
in place and this body glitter I guess
you could kind of put it on the
decolletage area as well I love that
word when it feels so fancy and yeah and
the white one is also lovely and it's
almost transparent as well it's not
really bright white so you can really
just use this to add glitter to wherever
I look you're creating if you don't want
to go super sparkly not to the sparkly
extremes of using
glitter then a literary eyeshadow
pallete is a really really lovely option
and I absolutely love this new one from
the Clarence Christmas range this is
called the natural glow 5 color
eyeshadow palette not entirely invented
but the packaging as you can see is that
rose gold copper and inside you've got
five glittery eyeshadows which are very
kind of neutral brownie shades quite
some white rose gold II in themselves
and I think these will be used to create
a really gorgeous glittery smokey eye
but not too bitter II so they've got
shimmer in them but they won't be like
crazy OTT glitter and because it's so
nifty you could pretty stick this in
your handbag if you need to top it
throughout the night but you're at a
Christmas party so you probably want to
do that I also love to use false lashes
when I go out for any kind of parties
they're definitely Christmas parties and
other moment I'm just so obsessed with
the eye your lash edit and this in
particular is the Hollywood blonde edit
I'm wearing a pair of right now I've
been wearing these like so much
absolutely love them the middle pair but
you've got a really very intense pair
down at the bottom there as well I just
love these lashes so much I've spoken
about them in so many videos recently I
forget that I'm wearing them because
they feel so light and so natural and
they just are really in my opinion easy
to apply so false lashes are lovely
wanted to just add a little bit of extra
definition to the eye area at Christmas
and any time of year and finally on the
beauty side of things I've chosen a
makeup fixing spray you definitely don't
want to worry about your makeup sliding
off in the middle of the night if you've
spent ages creating a perfect base
perfect contouring whatever you just
don't want it to go anywhere and L'Oreal
have got a new makeup and fixing spray
this for so long was only available in
the US but finally they brought it over
here and I have been loving it so far a
little spritz now it's quite quite big
like big particles so I may look a
little wet faced right now but it
doesn't have a horrible smell gosh it
doesn't have the horrible smell that a
lot of a drugstore makeup fixing sprays
have and I find that it works just as
well as the expensive ones like the
urban decay not that it's mega expensive
but you know it's more expensive than
this so um yeah this just works really
well it's not offensive smelling and it
keeps your makeup in
all night long so perfect for Christmas
parties New Year parties all that kind
of jazz next up is a fragrance and I
know this is a very personal choice
depending on what kind of things you
like but for me this season I think I'll
be wearing the wire style black opium
fragrance I originally fell in love with
this I think about May time and I really
kind of rediscovered it and brought it
back into my fragrance wardrobe if
that's if that's the thing recent leaks
has got very almost festive but still
really kind of sexy and worn sex that
you can you describe ur
perfume the sexy I think this is a
really gorgeous wonderful Christmas the
bottle is sparkly so yeah absolutely
love this one
next up is hair and I would not go out
with my hair like this for a Christmas
party this is far too boring to
sub-state the moment and I just can't be
dealing with anything but and yeah if
you do make gorgeous curls or whatever
you do with your head then you want to
keep them in place as well as keeping
your makeup in place so a little
miniature hairspray is a really good
idea to pop in your handbag or just pop
in your overnight bag for staying your
friend's house or if you've got ready
and you can't repeat Loreal Elnett
because I mean it's just a classic
product it keeps your hair in place but
it still has a little bit of movement I
can't stand it when you see people and
where you do it yourself where you have
hairspray on and your hair is rock stop
it so when you move your hair doesn't
move which it's never a good look and
Elnett is nice and flexible and the
small bottles are not too small they
have plenty of users in them and I don't
feel like I'm being ripped off with
these often with small hair squirty
things I feel like I'm getting really
ripped off but not really I'm not really
really like those so another festive
party essential I'm sure I counted 10
things but if I've got like 11 or 9 then
please forgive me but my next essential
is a clutch bag now I recently got this
one from Radley it's got my initials on
it
Radley do the most gorgeous leather
clutch bags this one is really handy for
Christmas because you can just like put
it through your arm with this little
strap and the colors are quite festive
but not so festive that you won't be
able to use it and at other times of the
year I think this is a really good size
you can be a phone in your makeup your
camera I'm showing my Olympus I'm
probably fit in here as well and it's
quite neutral color so it'll probably go
with a lot of you
Christmas outfits so speaking of fashion
my next festive party essential is this
obviously any sparkly skirt will do but
I've chosen this one from French
Connection this is one that I actually
brought for my birthday but I think it's
really good one for Christmas parties
because especially if you don't know the
dress code you can just kind of wear a
black roll neck or a black shirt blouse
and this and you're not going crazy
you're not going overboard wearing like
a reindeer sparkly dress or something
I'm not sure how that would work and
then you definitely don't want to be
going and getting a cold just before
Christmas actually probably starts so a
lovely warm coat is definitely a party
essential and at the moment I am so in
love with this one which is from Oasis
it's a beautiful gray faux fur coat faux
fur everywhere so I just think with this
kind of thing you always look like I'm
making such an effort you look like
you're super super glamorous but at the
same time you're still really really
warm which is the main thing at this
time of year it's got quite a luxurious
kind of silky feel lining and little
buttons down the middle actually I think
they're kind of hooks but yeah I think a
fur coat is just a lovely thing to wear
to and from Christmas parties you don't
want to obviously be going all out crazy
spending loads and money this one was
under 100 pounds and I think the colors
really gorgeous as well and I'm sure
I'll wear this one in springtime too and
then finally and I think this is the
10th thing I think I did count count
everything right but when you get home
at the end of the day do not forget to
take your makeup off that's super
important no matter how sloshed you are
just make sure that the face is clean
before you go to bed now I don't mean
like a full three-step routine but just
make sure that the makeup is gone and
the bulk of it is gone and for that you
cannot beat face wipes I don't like to
use face wipes on a table you regular
basis are taking my makeup off
but sometimes gal just gotta get it off
quickly and so and then go to bed so you
cannot beat simple when it comes to face
wipes these are limited edition super
soft which is just wonderful I think
I've quite like little festive festive
packet and I just love simple face wipes
they do the job they're gentle on the
skin and they get rid of all my makeup
including my super tough waterproof
mascara so simple face wipes are my
final and party
festive essential festive party
essential so there we have it my top 10
festive party essentials I think there's
some really fun and also useful bits in
here I definitely think like makeup
setting spray face wipes actually
everything is genuinely really really
useful for the festive coming up party
season a lot of this kind of stuff I'm
sure you will already have but I
hopefully I've given you some nice
little tips and ideas on things that
might ramela mike-mike make your party a
little bit more fun and glamorous if you
are heading out to any christmas parties
