going to be vlogging in the next couple
of days instead of doing weekly outfit
Diaries because there's so many fun
things going on over the next couple of
days in the build-up to Christmas so I
thought I would do a few a week instead
of just the one so hopefully there's
gonna be lots of nice things I can share
with you it is Sunday today it's a very
very cold Sunday I feel like my face is
so cold I'm not even talking early and
we've taken our two little hounds out
for a walk on caffeine common and then
the rest day we're just kind of spending
at home I feel really exciting package
waiting to be at home I'm gonna unbox
with you guys and then Holly and I are
going to pick up our Black Friday orders
now we ordered some very exciting things
from John Lewis a kettle and a toaster
but Charlie is very excited to pick them
up so yeah I'm just going to walk around
the common and then take these two
little boys back to the house
so we're back home now and I'm very much
looking forward just spending the
afternoon at home it is half past three
but it feels like already the evening
and it's so dark outside but I'm quite
looking forward to just spending the
afternoon at home relaxing and as
mentioned I do have a very exciting
delivery that I want to unbox with you
guys so here we have my exciting
delivery and is the new honor 7x phone
this is actually not out yet I have been
very very fortunate to have been sent
one of these before its release date
which is I believe the 5th of December
so not too long to wait it is a very
very competitive price point and has so
many incredible features so I'm really
looking forward to try it out and I will
of course let you guys know how I get
along so this is the phone it has got
this beautiful metallic very premium
looking body I must say and then on the
back I've noticed that there are two
camera lenses so that dual camera lens
normally leads to better photo quality
and this phone has really super quick
auto focusing and because of the dual
lens it means you get a really big
aperture as well which means hopefully
and this is what I'm really excited
about you're gonna get that beautiful
DSLR effect when out and about which
hopefully means I won't have to lug my
ginormous camera out with me and by that
I mean you know sometimes on Instagram
your favorite fashion bloggers might
have that gorgeous blurred out
background effect this phone can achieve
this whereas normally you have to spend
thousands of pounds on a big camera to
get that kind of effect so I'm very much
looking forward to this let's switch it
on I don't know what it is about new
technology but I get so excited about
things like this I feel like if you're
unboxing a new phone at Christmas then
you're likely to just spend the rest of
Christmas Day playing around with it I
know that that's what I'll be doing this
afternoon so of course I have already
done quite a bit of research on this
phone and there's a few features I'm
really excited to try out one of which
is the screen split mode I'm the kind of
person that likes to be super productive
and whether that means multitasking
doing a couple of things at once
I think that that mode is one I'm really
going to get a lot of use out of the
main thing for me it probably is that
May
picture quality and photo taking ability
that this phone allows and then also
when I'm working I like to have a big
screen obviously I do watch a lot of
YouTube videos so it's going to be
amazing for me to watch my videos on
such a ginormous screen I mean that is
absolutely incredible so I'm gonna spend
the next hour or so setting this up and
over the next few days and weeks I will
let you know how I get along with it a
Corsa phone is a big investment it's
something that you carry with you all
day every day we are a generation is
glued to our phones so it's so important
to choose one that works for you and not
just necessarily the one that all your
friends have so yeah I'm very much
looking forward to sharing my thoughts
on this one with you so I've spent the
past 10 minutes or so just getting
myself all logged into my favorite apps
and things on the new phone I have to
say the huge wide screen is really
impressing me so far on Instagram the
pitch quality just looks absolutely
amazing and you do get the full impact
of the picture because it takes up your
entire screen which I love YouTube as
well because it is such a wide screen
it's very cinematic cuz it's gonna be
amazing watching on my youtube videos on
there um so now I'm just gonna do all
the other fun bits like making a pretty
wallpaper setting all of that up because
everything has an Android phone because
everything is all connected to Google I
just had to sign in to my Google once my
Gmail and then everything was already
logged in so my YouTube my emails
everything's all logged in so it didn't
take me too long to set up at all I'm
actually now going to edit some of my
videos in front of the fire and then I'm
gonna do a bit more phone setting up
later on but for now it's time to do
some editing and time for another coffee
a few hours later and I've had a very
productive afternoon charlie has they're
working away in the kitchen and we're
having now a very relaxed Sunday dinner
in front of the TV by the fire we have
got a roast lamb can you see that down
there Dickens is looking like he might
might try and go for it it's a bit left
over for her lucky boys roast lamb sweet
potatoes sprouts and bacon so I'm going
to dig in and I'll catch up with you
later morning it's Monday morning and
last night I didn't really say goodnight
we'll finish off properly I went into a
bit of a food coma after our amazing
roast
dinner so sorry about that but today is
to start with which is working from home
I have just prepared my mid-morning
snack picked up a couple of cakes files
and Gayle's yesterday so going to enjoy
those now although Dickens is giving
them the eye he's not allowed any you're
not allowed any cakes my lady monkey I
also had a really lovely delivery this
morning from a brand that I recently did
a talk for so I recently was invited
into this company's office to do a talk
all about influencer marketing and they
sent this lovely gift over this morning
it is a personalized Aspinall passport
cover it's got my initials down at the
bottom there so that's a very very kind
little thank-you gift from them so this
morning already has been fairly
productive I've already filmed a video
hopefully gonna film another video
shortly and then heading into town staff
and noon to shoot some more contents I'm
going to try out the camera on the phone
as well and hopefully I can get some
lovely Instagram photos in the festive
vibe that is London everywhere is
looking so beautiful and festive at the
moment and I'm dying to give my
Instagram a bit of a festive makeover so
I hopefully capture some lovely content
on at the phone at later on this
afternoon so I'll take you along for
that oh and then I have a really lovely
dinner this evening with one of my
favorite brands Liz Earle so it'll be
nice to take you along to that as well
Oh God here she comes
it's too bad she'll never know
yeah I can't tell how I feel because she
knows a little bit later on I am with a
lovely April and we decided to leave the
house and do something a little bit but
we also need to take a couple of browse
photos and Instagram stories so I'm
going to be putting my new phone to the
test we have to literally comes answer
to there's a little like a roller
coaster behind me nutcrackers that's
German sausages no we're gonna just make
the most of the fact that it's still
fairly light and yet all the festive
lights around here are on going to take
some the Instagram story to talk about
how to layer up your winter outfit so
let's see how this phone compare
to a big at that our camera like
we're going to be comparing the page
equality between this and my big camera
because let's be honest we just come to
discover Alice anymore so for the sake
of our shoulders let's see Jen get some
nice photos on the new
as
now study was the
okay it's a little bit later on now and
I'm just about to head out for dinner

Gore Hotel in Kensington which is
actually where Kate Middleton got ready
for her wedding so it should be really
really lovely I'm very much looking
forward to it
outfit of the evening I've gone very
festive white Snow Queen for tonight
this top is from Jack Wales which really
surprised me that it was Jack Wills
actually I always think of them as like
cozy knitwear accessory-wise I'm just
wearing my Pandora necklace astrodome
you earrings usual Michael Kors watch
Monica villager ring and Monaco Canada
bracelet skirt this is actually an old
one from Club Monaco I've had this for a
few years now and I keep bringing it out
every winter I just feel like it's such
a lovely classic number then I've got my
Chloe Nile bracelet bag in the rose gold
which I I'm just so happy with this bag

be the handbag that I wear for all my
Christmas parties and then down here you
can see my shoes these are my Valentino
Rock studs again in the gold color

show you my shoes and I'm going to be
wearing my river island coat forever

absolutely adore this coat I think it
looks beautiful so I'll show you how it
looks with this on so this is the
finished look with the coat I'm totally
all white and gold this evening I really
like this look that this is my outfit of
the evening my taxi has just arrived
perfect timing I didn't actually get
everything done on my to-do list this
afternoon so I'm going to carry on
working in the taxi I also have to
publish the Instagram stories of the
photos that we took earlier at
winterville so it's going to be quite a
productive car journey but anyway time
to go I will see you later on
good morning as so States started off
with an amazing gym session I feel so
much better having to work out
and today I'm now spending the day in
town unto the detail kitchen to get
myself a nice healthy breakfast to
refuel the day
you working here a little bit and I got
to go to blow dry for the
drive-by it's not be really nice I'm
going to take those
so it should be a partner date if you're
not with me actually what pride lot
pampering things to say I'm then going
to get pedicure later on this afternoon
and also I'm doing a collaboration with
De Beers as in diamonds and I'm going to
pick out some pieces in master later on
as well so lots of fun things going on
today but settings birth de confianza
my hair blowdried and curled hutong two
pins but this is unfinished effects it
is seriously voluminous hopefully it's
going to last
outside it's drizzling a little bit oh
my gosh we can't let these cars graduate
so it's a little bit later on I have
pinned my amazing blow-dried back into a
bun because I really want it to last
till tomorrow so that was that was his
top tip was to pin it all back and then
tonight I'm probably gonna sleep with
her
put a shower cap on or something along
those lines so we have just been into
boots we filmed a little Instagram take
over for them which was fun
next on the agenda today is heading to
do piers are going to be looking at some
lovely sparkly pieces which are going to
be shots at fuel some Christmas content
that I'm doing next week so we're making
our way there now and then just a couple
more meetings and then my pedi date my
last afternoon meeting and then home for
an evening of work
trying to get my meetings on time but we
keep getting distracted by all the
beautiful festive decorations all around
Bond Street if you're visiting London
and you want to get some really nice
festive photos for Instagram definitely
check out all of the streets around 1:3
it's like old one Street the street the
carriages are on they are also so
beautiful so a slight distraction aside
running a tad late but never mind all
worth it
in a taxi now on my way to my final
meeting of the day I couldn't vlog in De
Beers because it was quite intense as
you can probably imagine very high
security but that last diamond that you
saw the last ring that I tried on was
worth nearly a million pounds which was
quite surreal to have something that
valuable on my finger I don't think I've
ever seen anything or let alone worn
something that valuables that was quite
an amazing experience and they were
teaching me all about the process of
rough diamonds about the diamond grading
system because I didn't have a clue I
just don't know anything about diamonds
so that was very insightful learns a lot
but yeah on my way to last meeting of
the day now and then it's home time back
home again now after a very busy and
productive day of meetings and
photoshoots and everything else that
happens in a busy blogger day before I
wrap up this vlog as well I have to
quickly show you my new leggings so
these are from Topshop
I picked these up today and oh my
goodness they are the most comfortable
things I have worn in so so long they're
like they feel like cashmere but they
were 22 pounds so I'm also going to
leave these link down below as well
because they're just the best things for
lounging around the house especially at
this time of year and I feel like you
guys will love them as much as I do so
yeah as always everything that I've
talked about in this video be linked
down below and I'm gonna end this vlog
here coz I'm where it's been quite a
long one if you got to the end then
