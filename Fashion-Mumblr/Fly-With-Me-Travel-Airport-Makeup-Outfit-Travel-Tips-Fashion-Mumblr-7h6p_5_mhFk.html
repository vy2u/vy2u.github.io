everyday May video I thought I would
make it more of a travel get ready with
me because in about an hour's time or
just under I am leaving to head towards
Birmingham Airport and I'm traveling to
Lanzarote with Thomas cook today on a
blogger trip so I thought it would be a
great opportunity for you to see my kind
of travel routine my hair my makeup my
outfit and also a few travel tips as
well along the way the first thing I'm
going to show you is my travel makeup
look which is this look here it's very
fresh very natural and really hydrating
so great for a day of traveling when you
just want your skin to look and feel
really really healthy before I did that
though I obviously got dressed and
before getting changed into my days
clothes I applied some of the LMS tan
accelerating lotion I've been using this
for a few weeks now and I really do
think it's starting to work when I was
in South Africa I got more of a tan that
I normally would do in that kind of
temperature so I definitely think it's
working so I'm applying that all over my
body before I get dressed next it's time
to do my makeup so prepare to see my
naked face so before I get started on my
makeup I'm just going to quickly tell
you what I've already got on my face
firstly I applied the new Lancome energy
to be serum and this just gives a little
bit of a glow to the skin so definitely
something that I look for when I'm
traveling I want to look healthy even
when the airplane is completely drying
out my skin also because the airplane is
so dry I've used my most hydrating eye
cream which is the Bobbi Brown eye cream
I also find that this sinks in so
quickly so really good if you're in a
rush you're rushing to get to the
airport you don't need to hang around
and wait for your eye cream to sink in
so this is a really good one and lastly
about ten minutes ago
I completely lathered my face in the
Charlotte Tilbury magic cream this is
just the most rich and luxurious
moisturizer that I own so perfect for
traveling and I really want to combat
the dryness from the airplane first
thing I'm going to put on my face is the
bare minerals blemish remedy mattifying
prep gel this is a really good primer
got a few spots kind of lurking that I
definitely don't want to appear while
I'm away so I'm going to put some of
this on to help combat any blemishes as
well as giving my skin and mattified
base ready to apply my makeup so I've
just focused that on my t-zone across my
forehead nose cheeks and chin as they're
the areas that tend to get the most
boilie next I'm going in with a really
moisturizing base and I'm using the by
Terry's cellular rose moisturizing CC
cream and I'm going to make it a little
bit darker with my NARS Laguna liquid
bronzer because I'm a tiny bit more
tanned than when I was and I purchased
this I'm using two drops of that and one
drop of the NARS and then it's going to
blend that all together on my hand I
always get a far too much when I do this
I should have used one drop of the by
Terry and then I'm just putting that on
my face and I'm going to use Clinique's
new foundation brush just to blend this
in all over my face
so this foundation brush is really great
at just doing a super speedy makeup look
because it's got these really big
bristles it's a little bit like that Mac
duo fiber brush in that it's really good
at picking up the right amount of makeup
and giving a really even coverage also I
loved it so quick because on the day so
I travel I don't really want to do a
completely perfect face of makeup I just
want to look good and I want to do it
really quickly as I want to have a bit
more brightness under my eyes I'm also
going to use the by Terry terribly Don's
Alize concealer and this is an
anti-wrinkle one so it's got some good
skincare benefits as well but also I
just love it because it's so bright and
really really moisturizing so I've just
patted that on using the applicator and
then I'm blending this in with my finger
I like to bring it down towards my nose
in a bit of a triangle shape and that
just really helps to highlight the face
a little bit I'm going to go back in
with my Clinique brush just to make sure
it's completely flawlessly blended into
my skin
next I want to set my base I don't want
this sliding away while I'm on my way to
the airport so I'm going to use the
Urban Decay Naked loose finishing powder
and one of my new zoeva rose golden
brushes just to really lightly apply the
powder onto my face I've only recently
started using this brush for my powder
but I find it's a lot lighter and I
don't get that really heavy cakey finish
that I used to do with a bigger powder
brush so I'm really focusing this on the
areas that I get shiny and my eyes on my
chin and the forehead so if I keep
looking over here by the way it's
because I don't have a mirror I'm just
using the viewfinder as my mirror this
morning filming this in a bit of a rush
but I leave the airport in less than an
hour so as you can see that powder
hasn't completely mattified my skin
there's still a bit of a glow coming
through it does help I have slightly
oily skin so that's naturally going to
happen but I do think that by using this
kind of brush it really has changed the
way I apply powder and I'm no longer
phobic of having a matte face next to
bring some warmth into my complexion I'm
going to use benefits hoola I really
like this one for travel because of the
little light cardboard box it's not
heavy or clunky like if
give my other bronzers and I'm going to
apply it with my Charlotte to operate
bronzing brush it's also got a little
mirror in the lid but actually I find
it's too small to really do anything
with but this bronze is a really lovely
shade just to add a really natural
sunkissed glow just applying it to the
areas that the Sun would naturally hit
my face on my cheeks down my nose and on
my forehead now I'm going to take care
of my brows and I'm going to use a bobby
brown brow pencil which has got a sharp
pointed nib on one end and a spoolie on
the other and first I'm just going to
comb through my brows just to create a
bit of a natural shape they're a little
bit sparse at the moment so first I'm
going to use the Bobbi Brown long-wear
brow gel to really create more of a
defined shape this is also as you can
tell from the name very long lasting so
great for dating or traveling and you
don't want to worry about where your
eyebrows are going throughout the day so
I'm using the sharp end of this brush
just to pick up small amount of the
product you really don't need much of
this at all and starting underneath the
brow I'm just going to draw almost an
outline of the brow shape
then once I've defined the shape I'm
going to go in with more of this and
fill in all the gaps at the front
section of my brow here I'm just using
really feather-light strokes to almost
replicate the look of individual brow
hairs now to make them look even more
natural I'm going in with Bobbi Brown's
eyeshadow in the shade blonde using the
same brush again the more pointed end
just to really feather in the brow hairs
and give it a little bit more depth and
volume as well
then I'm going to finish my brows just
using the Bobbi Brown natural brow
shaper this is a clear brow gel so it
really sets some in place but it also
has ingredients in it that help your
brows to grow and my brows need all the
help they can get so I love that has
that ingredient in there as well
that's my brows done I would probably
spend a little bit longer on my brows on
a normal day but because I'm flying and
I'm in a bit of a rush that is good
enough for me so next I'm going to put
on a little bit of eyeshadow and again
I'm going to use a bobby brown eyeshadow
palette this one is the beach glow
sunkissed nude eyeshadow palette I've
actually got this one in my little
trouble makeup bag because it's so tiny
but it has all the shades I need for
daytime and evening I pretty much use
these two pink shades as well as the
lighter one just on the brow bone I'm
not going to be too precise here this is
quite a natural glowing look for my time
on the airplane so I'm just using this
pink shade here and sweeping that all
over the eyelid using a fluffy zoeva
blending brush and then I'm going to
take a little bit of the sparkly shade
just for a pop of shimmer in the middle
which i think helps you look really
refreshed and awake and just a nicer
touch to what would otherwise be quite a
plain eyeshadow look just cleaning the
brush a little bit on my wrist before
going in with the lightest shade I'm
just sweeping that under my brow bone to
give a little bit of subtle highlight
I'm going to do mascara next and then
lips but to give it a few moments to
sink in I'm going to put my lip balm on
now before my mascara I'm using the
Bobbi Brown extra lip tint this is a
really beautiful pink tinted lip balm
and it's also very Homburg size so
that's why I've thrown this one into my
makeup bag it would be really nice to
wear this on its own
does give a very subtle pink tint
ellipse as you can see but I love it for
also preparing the lips for lipstick and
I'm just going to apply a very natural
lipstick next but first mascara and I'm
using my portable tweezerman eyelash
curlers these are really cute they kind
of fold up into practically nothing at
all so I'm going to use these to curl my
lashes they are a little bit harder to
use than normal eyelash curlers but once
you get the hang of it they're
absolutely fine
then I'm using rimmel's volume colorist
I'm still trying to tint my lashes and
it is working slowly but surely so this
is that mascara that slowly adds black
tint into your lashes and I find
especially on my lower lashes they
really need a bit more color so I've
been using this as a base coat for my
everyday mascara so while the Rimmel is
really good at giving color and fanning
out my lashes it doesn't really add
enough volume considering I'm not
wearing eyeliner today so for that
reason I'm also going to use my Lancome
Hypnose mascara and this is a really
beautiful one for adding so much volume
and definition I also really love the
applicator on this one it's a very
significant for combing out the eye
lashes which is great if you are using
another mascara first so hopefully you
can see that's giving me really
beautiful defined lashes but without
being clumpy at all or two over the top
so still nice and natural for traveling
last but not least I'm going to move on
to my lips and I have a new favorite
combination from Lancome this is a
really beautiful natural pink color not
too dissimilar to my previous Tom Ford
first time classic everyday lip look but
the formulation of this lipstick is also
incredibly hydrating so first I'm going
to line my lips with the lay contour in
the shade beige Rose is a beautiful lip
liner which is a perfect match for my
Lancome shine lover lipstick in this
beautiful very natural brownie pink so
absolutely perfect my kind of signature
color in even more hydrating formula
and there we go my finished makeup look
for a day of traveling this is a really
hydrating but very natural and fresh
glowy makeup look now that my makeup had
an outfit is done it's time to head to
the airport
