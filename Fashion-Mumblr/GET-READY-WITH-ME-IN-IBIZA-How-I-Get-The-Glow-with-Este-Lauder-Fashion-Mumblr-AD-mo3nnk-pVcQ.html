with me filmed here in Ibiza it's all
about how I get that beautiful glow
whether at home or away and includes
wellness and lifestyle food and
nutrition as well as skincare and makeup
today's video is in collaboration with
Estee Lauder I start the day with some
simple stretches great to the mind and
great to fill the body with oxygen it
really wakes me up and is a great way to
start a day throughout the day I keep
hydrated and not just of water but with
refreshing fruit and juices - it's not a
cocktail I promise at lunch I like to
keep things light as I don't want to get
lethargic throughout the day but you
know me a portion of chips is never too
far away
in the evenings after I shower is where
my skincare ritual begins my daily
skincare routine currently includes the
Estee Lauder nutritious micro algae
collection
it's especially perfect for when I
travel as it allows my skin to breathe
and helps to purify and balance the
complexion I dump in my skin before
reaching for the cleansing jelly it's
packed full of Estee Lauder's triple
algae blend and as a jelly consistency
which draws impurities from the skin and
refines the pores it helps to reduce
excess shine and bring a balance the
skin thanks the potent botanical
ingredients another it into a silky foam
before cleansing away no residue inside
another option for cleansing is the
cleansing bar crafted in Japan it's been
through a 60-day ten step framing
process before being cut into bars and
embossed and hand polished chlorella is
the hero ingredient which gives it this
green color it's very gentle and
purifies to radiant healthy skin next to
my routine is the micro clean tonic for
shake up radiance shake off shines I
love it it's got two phases which merge
when you shake it to create a perfect
ratio of clay and tonic
if instantly refreshing for the skin and
absorbs excess oils and after the
cleanser it works to minimize pores as
the complexion and reduce excess shine
finally as part of the simple skincare
routine I apply the lightweight fluid
lotion also containing that signature
triple algae blend with chlorella for
detoxification spirulina for adding
proteins and minerals to skin and
laminaria luxury now which is known for
regulating the production of sebum that
helps to keep the pores clear motion
gives my skin instant radiance hydration
and antioxidant protection pores are
minimized and my skin is perfectly
prepared to add my makeup I use a light
base a simple BB cream to allow my
skin's natural glow to show through
followed of course by brows I'm using
the brow now to add shades of color I
use a touch of bronzer to add more
warmth to the complexion and a touch of
blush to add a rosy colored the cheek I
like to keep things simple on my eyes
just a light shade all over the base and
up to the brow bone and a darker shade
on the crease the subtle definition I'm
adding a touch of my favorite mascara
just with some added volume
as the rest of my look is a light and
simple and adding a pop of color on the
lips using my favorite lip shade
volatile and here's the finished look my
skin looks balanced with a subtle glow I
keep my outfit simple and chic and a
statement bag and statement sets perfect
for an evening in Ibiza I hope you've
enjoyed getting ready with me and thank
you so much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
