speedy get ready with me this is how I
get myself ready from hair to skin care
and makeup in just 30 minutes
today I've just come inside from a day
at the beach but I use a similar routine
at home too when getting ready for work
or perhaps after a session at the gym
this video is in collaboration with
Moroccan oil whose products I have been
obsessed with for many years I'm
starting off my speedy routine with a
quick shower I use a nourishing shampoo
to cleanse and a light conditioner on
the ends of my hair after wrapping my
hair up in a towel I whiz through some
skin care i'm using a micellar water to
remove any traces of makeup and then a
toner to balance out the skin
I apply the Kiehl's ultra facial cream
to hydrate my skin this one also has SPF
30 so you're getting your sun protection
and your moisture all in one hit I'm
using the body shops Shay body butter to
nourish the skin on my body leaving it
soft and smooth and I'm obsessed with
it's nutty fragrance - and now we move
on to my hair as my hair is colored it
can get a little naughty when I shower
and it needs lots of special care to
keep it in great condition the first
thing I do is reach for the Moroccan oil
treatment and I apply this to the ends
of my hair I've been using this since my
hairdresser recommended this to me about
five or six years ago and now I just
don't know how I was able to style or
even brush my hair without it it's the
perfect foundation for any hair care
routine I apply a pump or two to the
ends of my hair and brush through it
makes brushing my hair so much easier
and also helps to restore and revive
hair that's been damaged from color and
also environmental factors - it's
absorbed quickly leaving no greasy
residue and over time the argan oil
formula nourishes and strengthens the
hair next I know my hair with a Moroccan
oil hydrating styling cream this can be
used on all hair types and it contains
the brand's signature argan oil to
intensely condition the hair it's fab
for creating beautiful smooth hair
styles and has very soft holding
properties - to give beautiful
definition to your finished style I
apply a couple of pumps to damp hair and
between washes sometimes I apply a small
amount to the ends - which helps to
fight frizz and refresh my style with
this combination my hair is so much more
manageable and it's great for when I'm
trying to get ready in a short space of
time as not only does it help with
detangling but it also speeds up my
blow-dry time - I usually rough dry my
hair to about 80% dry and then to
maximize my time I choose my outfit and
get dressed before moving on to my
makeup
I'm clipping the front sections of my
hair out of my face but still keeping it
down so that it can continue to dry
naturally by this point my moisturizer
has sunk in so I apply a light layer of
foundation using a damp Beauty Blender
makes it much easier and quicker to
blend into the skin so this only takes a
few seconds to give my face an instant
fresh look I apply a serum based
concealer under my eyes and this one
from Bobbi Brown is my absolute favorite
then to set the two down a light dusting
of mineral based powder from my bare
minerals compact
a quick touch-up of my brows using a
fine pencil from Giorgio Armani and the
benefit gimme brow to perfect the shape
and then I reach for my bronzer to add a
warm and healthy glow to my face
ensuring I focus on the areas where the
Sun would naturally hit my skin this big
bronzing brush from Charlotte Tilbury
means again I can complete my base in
just a few seconds I keep it very simple
on my eyes this cream eyeshadow from
Estee Lauder is so simple to use I apply
using the doe foot applicator and then
just blend with my fingers and it's such
a beautiful and versatile metallic shade
a quick swipe of mascara and my eye look
is completed if I've got time I'll swipe
a makeup brush over my blush and
highlight palettes from it cosmetics to
add a fresh pop of color to my
complexion and to complete my makeup I
apply my favorite lip combo which at the
moment is the Victoria lipliner from the
Victoria Beckham Estee Lauder
collaboration and the insatiable ivory
lipstick from Estee Lauder that I've
been wearing non-stop for months now
so now it's time to take my hair down
from the clip and complete my hairstyle
I'm blow-drying it until it's completely
dry this time using a hair brush to
smooth and further detangle thanks to
the Moroccan all hair treatments my hair
has a beautiful soft texture and a
lovely shine tomb which my fellow
blondes will know is not easy to achieve
with coloured hair
tonight I want to achieve an
effortlessly textured look for my hair
so I use a Moroccan oil dry texture
spray it has a dry gritty finish and
adds volume and long-lasting hold to
hair styles I shake it up and then spray
from about 20 centimetres away while
telling my hair for extra volume and
movement then is the finishing touches
jewelry perfume etc now here's one of my
favorite time-saving hacks to get a soft
wave to my hair I twirl it up into a bun
and secure with a clip
keeping it in that style while I commute
or travel to my destination when I undo
it my hair has even more volume and
movement thanks to the dry texture spray
so there we go
this is my finished look I really hope
you enjoyed the video and I'll see you
in the next one
