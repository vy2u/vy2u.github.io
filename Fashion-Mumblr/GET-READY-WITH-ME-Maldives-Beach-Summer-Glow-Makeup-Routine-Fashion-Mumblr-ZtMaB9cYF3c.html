get ready with me I have just got out of
the shower and I'm going to show you my
full skin and makeup routine for tonight
I'm starting off with the L'Occitane
aqua Rio TM moisturizing mist this is
super hydrating and just great at
freshening the skin and then I'm using
my herbivore toner this has got
antioxidant rich green tea soothing aloe
vera so great at calming and balancing
the skin then I'm going to use my Eve
LOM hydrating serum this helps to plump
and smooth and it's really easily
absorbed as well so great for before
makeup I'm going to use my LM s pro
clutch and eye creme next this really
helps to reduce any fine lines around
the eyes and very nourishing for the
skin too then another favorite this is
the herbivore pink cloud moisturizer
it's got rosewater in there which is
naturally high in antioxidants so very
smoothing and then it's also got aloe in
there and did you know that aloe is very
high in salicylic acid so great at
preventing blemishes which is really
good when you're on a holiday and also
white tea which is youth preserving and
helps protect the skin from pigmentation
I'm a big fan
then I'm using the YSL instant moisture
glow primer it blurs the skin has very
smoothing formula helps with hydration
and just gives you a really lovely
luminous base to start off your makeup
as well actually actually drop this in
the sea after using it tents the very
sad face right now moving on I'm gonna
tie my hat with an invisible these are
just amazing on holiday don't snag your
hair or anything like that using my
favorite fair minerals complexion rescue
this is gonna be my base it's very
hydrating it's got naturally derived
ingredients which help to replenish the
skin boost radiance and it's also got
SPF 30 which is also very important in
the evenings because it's still still
pretty bright as you can see and the
coverage is I'd say sheer to medium you
don't want anything too heavy on holiday
so this I find is just absolutely
perfect and I'm blending it in with a
brush then my Laura Mercier concealer
this I'm using under the eyes it helps
to brighten I do have some serious eye
bags going on from all the flying
and I'm smoothing that out with my
beauty blender also popping some around
the nose and the areas that need a bit
extra coverage then my bare minerals
Behr Pro concealer this one's a little
bit thicker so great for any blemishes
I've got a few around the jaw line at
the moment so patting it in with my
finger first and then using a Beauty
Blender to smooth that out unnoted
blemishes this tea tree oil from Body
Shop is a really good ones keeping a
suitcase because it just helps any
blemishes go down while you're abroad
then I'm using my fresh lip balm that's
the sugar 1 and then the Laura Mercier I
think this is called the candle light
powder also really luminizing it doesn't
totally mattify the skin but it helps to
set down all of those creamy products
I've put on at prior it's my bronzer i'm
using this lovely one from the Guerlain
terracotta range I just think there's a
very natural beautiful complexion color
applying that on the cheekbones any
areas a Sun would naturally hit the face
as you can see just very very natural
I'm using a benefit this is a brow brush
and I find the spoolie just extra fluffy
and perfect for coming out to my lashes
which are looking fabulous because I had
the SPS treatment from Nouveau lashes
and then I'm using my it cosmetics brow
pencil it's got the universal taupe
shade so one shade suits everybody just
to fill in the brows and I'm setting
them in place with my hourglass brow
fiber gel next from the Poppy's Salvage
collection from Estee Lauder just
swirling my brush around the blush and
kind of bronzy shade in there again I
find this really natural super pretty
color and the Charlotte Tilbury
exaggerated palette is just an absolute
favorite at the moment I'm using this
matte brown shade for the base and then
I'm going to go in with a slightly
deeper shade and that will help to
create a little bit of definition around
the crease area this just takes me like
20 seconds I'm not a perfectionist when
it comes to eye makeup then to add a bit
more definition I'm just using the Bobbi
Brown eye crayon I use this in place of
eyeliner just to add a little bit more
intensity then this is a Tom Ford thing
this is called a highlight you oh I like
to use
kind of Mooney pearlized end and then
I'm blending that in making it
supernatural with my Beauty Blender it's
a very very subtle highlight perfect for
on a holiday in the daytime I use that
Dior Addict tattoo that you just saw but
at the moment I'm going to use these new
lip lacquers they're the plumping lip
lacquers very hydrating intense color
give you a real lacquered finish and
very very long-lasting I think they
actually tend the lips so you have the
color lasts all evening
finishing with another mist of my locks
tan spray because you can never have too
many sprays when you are in the maldives
skin gets super dry finishing off with
my Chloe Nomad and taking my hair down
and letting that dry naturally to finish
the look here's my outfit of the evening
pink wrap dress
Chloe sunglasses my favorite straw bag
and that is my look for the evening hope
you enjoyed today's video and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
