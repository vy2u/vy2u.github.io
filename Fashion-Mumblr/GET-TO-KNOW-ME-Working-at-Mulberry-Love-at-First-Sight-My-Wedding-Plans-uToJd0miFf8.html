youtube channel today I thought I would
film a bit of a get to know me video
because I've been on YouTube for just
over a year now my April favorites video
marked my one-year anniversary on
YouTube and while you guys know that I
love beauty products I love to play with
them and I put them on my face and I've
photographed them I talked about them
and I love fashion I show you that all
the time on my channel and of course I
love to travel there is so much model
that you don't know about me
so I thought I would take this
opportunity to film to get to know me
YouTube tag which I haven't actually
found yet so bear with me two moments
okay I've got no idea if this is the
official one I just went with the first
one that came up on Google so let's get
to know me alright so the first thing is
vital stats my name you guys actually
may not know that it's my full name is
my battery flashing No okay good my full
name is Josephine Harriet Mary fear and
no I don't really put that that many
places so maybe that was new information
for you that's my name the next one is
nicknames and so when I was in school I
used to be called Joe and I didn't
really like being called Joe I don't
really know why why I let that stick so
much but there was another Josie in my
class and she got the JC nickname so I
was Joe which led to me being called
Joff um because my finish will being Jo
F which again I didn't really like so
then it became Josie Josie is what most
people shorten it to Charlie calls me J
dog J splash mousy sometimes because I'm
a Lincoln fee um yeah I think that's
about it really not too many crazy
adventures nicknames birthday my
birthday is November 24th 1991 and I did
have to Google this that means I'm 24
years old my place of birth now I was
born in Herefordshire hospital not
Hartford shares only people that live
inland
think character and heart for sure the
same thing para Fisher is a County close
to Wales that's pretty the best way of
describing it and that's where I was
born star sign you may have already
figured this out if you know your star
signs by my birthday but my star sign is
Sagittarius occupation so my current
occupation is I'm a full-time blogger
and youtuber and I still have to pinch
myself at that it's the case because
it's the coolest job in the whole world
I can't even lie to you and but before
that so I'm not sure if this is going to
go into university and stuff let's have
a look No so I will tell you now so I
went to the London College of Fashion
and I studied fashion management if you
guys are interested in this and kind of
first stage of my career then let me
know and I'll throw an in-depth video on
it so I went to London Cod fashion I got
first in my degree I worked really hard
for it so super duper pleased to get the
first when I finished uni or actually a
little bit was at uni I worked at
mulberry as in handbag company mulberry
and I spent about a year interning there
before going on to be a marketing
assistant and I absolutely loved that
job it's so incredible being right in
the heart of the fashion industry I
worked on fashion shows I worked on
magazine advertising there was just so
much going on in that company is so
glamorous and it's really incredible to
work for a luxury fashion company I
really love my time there and but then I
had a job offer from a software company
called cortex card who have a visual
search software and I spent nearly 2
years as their marketing manager and so
I was in charge all the website social
media just anything that is outwardly
projected about the company and that was
again really incredible great to learn
more about the digital space and we
worked with some really great clients
where I worked with like net-a-porter
and John Lewis debenhams
so that was a super job and I did that
job and ran my blog for nearly two years
actually the whole time I was there
and then my blog just started to take
over my life
any free time I was waking up before in
the morning to do my blog work and I was
getting so many opportunities for the
blogs I was having to turn down because
of my day job so I decided to hand in my
notice and now I'm a full-time blogger
next up is appearance and I'm pretty
sure you guys all know what I look like
but just in case hair color is blonde
although naturally it's dark brown whoa
that's a really bad lighting to show it
looks like my roots are really really
bad actually my hair does desperately
need coloring but yeah my natural hair
color is kind of like a mousy brown hair
length is long it's kind of just below
the boob length eye color is kind of
greeny Brown and mozhet I used to call
it which is like the French for hazel
that's that's my car my best feature um
I don't really know what my best feature
is a few people um probably would say my
hair although I find it really really
hard to manage so um I didn't know
actually my bomb I have a good bun of
that am I allowed to say that about
myself I don't know but I think I've got
a good bum when I squat I need to start
squatting again braces okay so it just
those braces it doesn't ask any
questions around it I'm not currently
wearing braces although I am getting
clear braces very soon I've been
following the process with this company
called dual smile direct and they're
going to be fitting me with clear braces
because I have really wonky lower teeth
yeah but really gross and when I was
younger I did have a brace to push my
bottom jaw forward because I used to
suck my thumb so my jaw was soaking fee
and I still wear retain that a night
chiming I have brace nights so that's
really really fun uh
piercings so the only thing that I have
pierced and have ever had pierced is my
ears I don't even wear earrings that
much I've just been wearing these really
lovely dainty ones from jewelry box I
think that's what it's called
um for the past few weeks and yeah I'm
not really a piercings kind of person
I've never really wanted to get anything
else pierced yeah so that's it tattoos I
don't have any tattoos when I was about
18 I did really want to get a little
elephant tattoo but now I'm really glad
that I didn't because I just wouldn't I
just certainly it would suit me anymore
I think that's such a huge decision such
a big thing to get done and it's just
personally not something that I'm into
so no tattoos and righty or Lefty I'm a
righty although I have my cutlery to arm
around I put my knife in the right hand
which I think it's opposite to most
people okay firsts first best friend so
my first best friend was Meggie and we
became friends in primary school and
then Mickey left me and moved to
Australia but actually she's getting
married this summer and Charlie now
going out to Australia in July to go to
her wedding so Meggie was my first ever
best friend and we still keep in touch
even though she lives on the other side
of the world first award
um I guess it depends what kind of award
I guess when we were younger when I was
younger I got a headmistresses
distinction which was like the highest
reward you could win in my school for my
autumn leaves poem which I had to read
out in front of the whole school when I
was like seven years old and what oh I
don't know awards and I guess like
sporting awards although I was really
rubbish at sports I probably didn't get
any of those I also got a headmistresses
distinction for an art project when we
visited the Pitt rivers Museum when I
was in again I think cast six or
something so that was them that was good
fun but my first proper reward was
probably be the one that I got recently
the Johnson Johnson best beauty blogger
award anything I've won a proper award
like that ever before so maybe that's my
first award so the next one is first
sport I don't really know what that
means maybe skiing that was a first foot
that I was good at I'd started skiing
when I was about six years old and I
wasn't very sporty when it comes like
tennis or rounders of that kind of thing
so I would have to say skiing and first
real holiday um I don't really remember
it I probably just remember it from
photos but when I was about
two or three we went to Hong Kong
Singapore and little island off the
coast of Singapore called tear man which
is just the most beautiful little
paradise island in the South China Sea
but yeah I don't really remember it but
I'm sure that was my first proper
holiday and first concert so my first
concert was busted and McFly with the
warm-up act
so technically McFly were the first band
that I ever saw live next up is
favorites so my favourite film now this
is between Titanic and Legally Blonde I
love both of those films are both
completely different to each other
leaky blonde because Elle Woods was
always my icon I wanted to be successful
like her although not in a law law
degree but I wanted to just be as
fabulous and successful as Elle Woods
and she was just yeah she was my icon so
I loved leggy blonde but it's so funny
still of that movie in fact I really
want to rewatch it's been a couple of
years since I last watch that and then
Titanic oh my gosh I was so obsessed
with the Titanic I wonder if I've got
the book here no I don't have it but
basically my prep school best friend
Georgie and I know no it wasn't Georgie
as Rianne so a girl that I was best
friends with in my gear seven-year egg
we're both so obsessed with Titanic we
made a Titanic scrapbook like a fact
book
I could probably reel off so many
Titanic facts you right now I'm not
gonna do that um but yeah I love that
film of course I fancy Leonardo DiCaprio
and I kind of loved disaster films I
loved end of the world things like 2012
or 2012 Olympus is fallen I just love
those kind of movies
favorite TV show now I'm not really a TV
show person if that makes sense I have
like an OCD I need to always be being be
doing something productive so I don't
tend to watch TV that much but having
said that I do like to have some
background noise on I love modern family
I love Parks and Recreation at the
moment and loving scandal um they're all
American obviously I do like American TV
shows but I used to love Britain's Next
Top Model and Marika's Next Top Model
used to love and spring the Teenage
Witch Buffy the Vampire Slayer if you
can remember that far back but yeah
that's going way back favorites color
come on pink obviously favorite song hmm
I don't know this always changes I love
Coldplay was that going to be one of the
questions no I'm not spoiling a future
question
I love Coldplay so basically anything by
them adventure a lifetime
him for the weekend something's called
him for the weekend to be honest a one
oh that one yeah love that one um and
yeah it's again my favorite songs the
moment favorite songs of all time
I love Enya Caribbean blue you probably
don't know what that is let me just play
it figuratively so this song reminds me
of holidays and this is the song also
that I want to walk down the aisle to
when I get married so let me just play
it for you
okay so the church doors open now and I
start to walk down the aisle it's kind
of operatic I think my mum used to play
this when I was younger and now I just
love it
oh dear ok so yeah that's probably my
favorite song of all time and next is
favorite restaurant I would have to say
Hawksmoor
maybe I love a good steak so I love
hawks more close to my house we have a
boqueria which is a Spanish restaurant
so I love tapas so that's another
favorite and used to be obsessed with
TGI Fridays so I love that there's not
one that really sticks out but mostly
meat orientated restaurants favorite
store I would have to say Selfridges
because it has so many favorites under
one roof it's got like all the beauty
brands it's got Topshop it's got
Valentino it just has everything that I
love so maybe that's a cheat answer but
I love Selfridges favorite book um don't
really have a favorite book apart from
Paco Underhill's why we buy which I
think I've mentioned before in a video
is all about the psychology of how we
shop and I am fascinated by everything
that guy has to say in fact I really
want to do a video on it because it's so
interesting all these things that we do
without meaning to and all the tricks
the retailers play on this to make us
buy more so that book I found so
interesting when I studied it a uni and
I still refer back to it so fascinating
favorite magazine I don't really like
magazines I feel like they're a little
bit old-school but I do still have
Garcia subscribed to me I get it
delivered every week but to be honest it
goes on read in its plastic wrapper
quite often but I do like to read the
one on holiday and I also always grab my
glamour and a Cosmo from the airport so
I say they're my favorite magazines
favourite shoes without a doubt my
Valentino Rock studs they were my first
ever proper designer purchase I bought
them for my graduation and as you guys
know I wear them all the time for like
any special occasion the next section is
called currently so currently feeling
currently feeling a little bit stressed
and rushed because I need to get to
Charlie's parents house for his sister's
birthday meal in about now watch on that
and in about an hour's time so a little
a little bit rushed a little bit anxious
moment single or taken obviously taken
I've been with Charlie for four years it
was our four year anniversary yesterday
and I really want to do the boyfriend
tag video so next time we're on holiday
together I think we're gonna have film
the boyfriend tag so let me know if
that's something you want to see
currently eating
okay well technically I was drinking
this smoothie which Charlie made for me
I have no idea what's in it it looks a
little bit gross now it's an orange with
a I don't know I think it's probably
carrot juice with ice so it's a carrot
slash happy sounds gross currently
listening to nothing because I'm filming
a video but before that we were
listening to Caribbean blue and yeah um
but before that I was in the gym so I
was listening to a little bit of Justin
Bieber a little bit of Beyonce that kind
of thing currently watching myself on a
little screen I don't know how Tom's
back question currently wearing I'm
currently wearing a necklace from
accessorized a top from oh gosh I cannot
remember this is from Topshop I think I
will leave the link down below and jeans
well try not to fall over jeans from
American Eagle Outfitters okay future
one children yes I do I want to have two
or three children ideally two girls and
one boy I definitely won't have a little
girl and I know you can't choose as long
as it happy and healthy
um but yeah yes I do want children
future do you want to be married yes I
do want to mode I don't want to be one
of these people nods anything wrong with
it that gets my Justin to get engaged
I'd love to be engaged for a few years
and get married and then have children
but nothing ever happens to be plans so
who knows future careers in mind I would
love to continue doing what I'm doing
now for as long as possible I don't know
where the blogging industry is going I
don't think many people do it's so hard
to predict but one thing I know for sure
is I'd love to always be my own boss I
learned pretty quickly that I'm not the
kind of person that likes to be chained
to a desk doing a 96 office job so of my
future career is I would like to be the
boss future where do you want to live
um I really like where we live now we
live in southwest London I really like
our house um but I think when time comes
I don't want to have some babies or we
want to have some babies then I'd like
to move out to Surrey where it's more
room you can get a little bit more for
your money or known although not that
much more and I think I will always
state in England and around London
because I like it here
do you believe in God um this is really
hard I'm not a very religious person I
would never be like I didn't believe in
God because I'm not an atheist or
anything but I definitely believe
something's going on it there I believe
in karma I went through a phase of
believing in like Buddha what but it was
a person but um yeah not really do you
believe in miracles
yes I definitely believe in miracles as
I said karma I believe in like what goes
around comes around and I do definitely
believe the miracles can happen and I'm
such a believer in when you say like
it's meant to be so many things in my
life just seem to have happened because
of an instant decision that I made like
meeting Charlie in the Maldives which is
crazy
was as a result of an instant decision
that we made my mum and I so yeah I
definitely believe in miracles and
believe that things happen for a reason
do you believe in love at first sight um
at the risk of sounding like the biggest
Scrooge I don't think I do because I
think you would need to really get to
know someone I definitely believe in
lust at first sight like obviously since
I saw joy cycle he's handsome but it
took a while to fall in love because
yeah I think to love someone you need to
know that person so I mean it's so hard
to tell it's so hard to say this without
sounding like such a such a downer but I
don't believe in love at first sight but
I definitely believe in love do you
believe in ghosts yes I definitely do
believe in ghosts um I definitely
believe that there's something else in
this world that we live in and my main
reason for believing in ghosts is
because I've heard really like
goose-bumpy ghost stories from people
that just wouldn't make it up like one
of Charlie's mom and dad's friends who
is a manager of a hotel called the great
Fosters so I'm not sure if I should be
saying that's haunted on my youtube
channel um but he tells stories of
ghosts in their bedrooms and he's not
the kind of guy to make it up so yeah I
do believe in ghosts and I've had a few
spook experiences myself which I won't
go into it's not like on a video but um
yes I do aliens again there's this guy
that my mom's friends were like a farmer
in Gloucester and he had this weird
experience that he swears and swore was
aliens and he's not the kind of guy to
 either so maybe I do but I've
never had any intergalactic experiences
do I believe in soulmates yes 100%
definitely I don't believe that you're
restricted to just one um but yeah I
definitely believe in soulmates do I
believe in heaven and hell um I don't
know I believe that you should be good
in your life because so it's not worth
the risk imagine if it was and then you
just been naughty or old life but I
don't really believe that like there's
angels in the sky and there's Devils
down below I'm not really sure it's kind
of the same as asking if you've even God
isn't it do you believe in kissing on
the first date
um yeah I do I think if the feeling is
right and you are not being pushed into
it as long as it's your decision then
yeah there's nothing wrong with kissing
on the first date and finally do you
believe in yourself yes I do believe in
myself I think it's so important that
you believe in what you're doing believe
that you're doing the right thing that's
your job your relationship status or
your friendships I do think it's so
important to believe in yourself I think
no working for myself has really pushed
that and has done a lot for my
self-confidence and
pendants so yes I'm deeply for myself
and that is all the questions in the get
to know me YouTube tag so I hope you
guys enjoyed that let me know in the
comments if there's anything that
surprised you anything you didn't know
about me or anything that you thought
might be different and I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video and hopefully
you feel a little bit closer to me now I
know it's been a year and I probably
should have done this a little bit
sooner but yeah hopefully you enjoyed
this video don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you did and if you are not
subscribed to my channel then it'll mean
a lot to me if you did also we are kind
of kind of getting close to 20,000
subscribers which is mental um I'm
starting to think about if I'll do like
a certain video for my tiniest xx for my
20,000 subscribers so there's a
particular video you'd like to see then
let me know a few people have said a
house tour or an evening routine both of
which I'd love to film I think a house
tour be really fun so let me know what
you like to see if and when I reach 20k
