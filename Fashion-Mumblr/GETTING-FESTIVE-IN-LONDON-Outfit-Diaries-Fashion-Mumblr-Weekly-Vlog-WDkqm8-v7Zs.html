couple of really fun days planned I've
got a couple of lovely festive blogger
events and I always really love vlogging
these because it's just such a nice way
of remembering the experience and also
sharing the experience because brands
always do such lovely things at this
time of year and I'm so grateful to be
invited and I just love looking back on
these things and hopefully you guys
enjoy watching them too I was going to
show you my outfit of the day um but
there's actually no full-length mirror
in this room so I'm just gonna have to
somehow prop my camera up in a second
but right now I am at the beautiful
artists Residence Hotel this is one of
my favorite hotels in London definitely
one that I would recommend if you're
coming for a long weekend or if you're
visiting from abroad
beautiful location amazing rooms I
actually filmed one of my it's spring
occasion where look books in the grand
suite before and I'll leave that one
link down below so you can see how
beautiful that room is this is a room
directly above it it's room number 4 and
it's I think it's called their club
suite it's kind of like the masculine
version which is really really cool it's
really big for a London room you've got
beautiful leather armchairs a nice huge
bed bed and then a really lovely
bathroom that way as well which I'll
show you a little bit later so today so
far I've just had a few meetings as you
saw very briefly I had three meetings in
my favorite no surprises farm girl cafe
and that was very productive really good
fun and then this evening I'm here with
Ilia which is a beauty brand to do the
lovely eyelashes and my favorite brow
products so it's gonna be a really fun
evening okay so I've got you up on the
windowsill to show you my outfit of the
day so first of all my handbag you may
have seen my unboxing free humbugs video
this is the Radley one and I've been
wearing it with the shoulder strap very
practical and it just fits a lot of my
bits and bobs inside that's when my
handbag of the day and then Mike
this is a coat that I got from a Reese
last year it's burgundy not sure you can
really tell in the lighting there but
I've just been a huge fan of Burgundy
this year and it really wrapped
something nice and warm so nice and cozy
can't wait to take it off though because
this room it's absolute boiling
underneath I have got a Club Monaco this
is a cashmere wool
Rolo neck or polo neck whatever you want
to call them against us from last year
but I'll try to find something similar
link down below and then this is my Zara
skirt I tilt the camera down a little
bit this I wore a lot in New York if you
saw my New York outfit diaries and yeah
I just really like this outfit and then
I've got it with my Karen Millen boots
which I have been wearing a non-stop
this season and then accessory-wise I
can hold the camera up for this one I've
got my Kate Spade earrings these have
got like the little gems and then a big
pearl which I'm a big fan of and my Kate
Spade sunglasses I just really like this
accessory combination and as usual on my
wrists I've got a bracelet this time
it's my Swarovski BMX bracelet which is
pearl and sort of a crystal pretty
beautiful and my watch I have been
getting it so many questions about this
watch even today every single person
that I met was like oh my god tell me
about your watch it's so cool so this is
the Michael Kors access SmartWatch and
it's the Sophie design and I've had it
for about three weeks now and cannot
imagine my life without it anymore I've
become totally in love with it totally
smitten and I think it's not only a
really beautiful design but also does so
many things I find really really useful
personally one of my favorite things
about it is the fact that it has my
calendar on there so if I'm dashing
about here and there I can just swipe up
and I can see on my meetings for the day
where I need to be next any deadlines
that I've got and it also shows me my
notifications I will show you throughout
the vlog when it pings up with a
notification but for example today I was
at a meeting I didn't want to be
constantly checking my phone but I knew
I had a new YouTube video just up so I
wanted to keep an eye on the comments
and every now and then my watch would
just light up a slight buzz on the wrist
and it would let me know when there's
new comments and I could just check
those check my Instagram notifications
so that's a couple of my favorite
features but yeah I'll let you know
about a few more of the features
throughout the video so for now I'm
put on a face mask and start getting
ready for the evening so I had a meeting
with Garnier earlier and she very kindly
topped me up with my favorite my
slaughter so I'm gonna take my makeup
off and then use that moisture bomb
tissue mask this is a super hydrating
and deterring one so I'm going to pop
that on now and hopefully brighten up my
skin ready for this evening Wednesday
morning had a really really lovely
evening last night here the artists
residence we had a nice dinner three
Koston and downstairs and before that we
got all dolled up by one of the idea
makeup artists tried out some of their
new lashes which was really really
lovely this morning we're just gonna
head down for a nice chilled breakfast
all together and then I'm going to be
using the suite directly below this one
which is the lovely crown suite and I'm
gonna do a few blog photos making the
most of the opportunity of a beautiful
room so I'm gonna meet the girls now for
breakfast very very quick outfit of the
day
again you'll recognize this and if you
watch my New York vlogs I'm wearing my
chunky Marks &amp;amp; Spencer knitted jumper
that I'm just living in underneath of
course
my thermal same Zara skirt and boots is
yesterday got my watch on as always it's
been so useful this morning just keeping
an eye on my notifications and my warts
apps particularly when I'm getting ready
I like to have a youtube video playing
on my phone so it's nice that I can just
keep an eye on everything else on here
also last night I was kind of showing it
off to Mattie and I was showing her how
you can put your Instagram photos as a
background so right now I have this
really lovely photo that I took in New
York as my background so show you that
how cute is that that's me in New York
so it's a little bit later on now I feel
like I've been very bad and neglecting
of this blog but as you can see I've had
a bit of a makeover I've come to very
snazzy house in North London I think
we're in Camden not too sure and the GHD
team on giving us a little makeovers
before we all go out for dinner tonight
so I've had a girl from Charlotte's Hill
we do my makeup and my hair looks so
stunning they use the GHD curve to
create these beautiful big curls and
I've got a lovely bow in the back and
but I thought I just very quickly give
you about the house tour because it's
like a bloggers dream there's makeup
artists hair stylists and a photo studio
downstairs in this very chilled kitchen
area of this incredible Camden mansion
having a cup of tea I think we're going
out for dinner a little bit later to
another restaurant in the Camden Town
I'm gonna quickly show you my outfit of
the day because I have switched it up
since I've logged this morning stand up
make it easy to show you I'm actually
all in Topshop now I was taking some
outfit photos for Topshop so I've got my
lovely little this is a white version of
the pink fur coat that I've got thought
the white was nice and classic and then
this dress is quite similar to the
purple one that I wore a couple of weeks
ago and everybody really really liked
this one is kind of like a black velvet
version big fan of this and then I'm
also wearing my recent stiletto boots
which are very very comfortable got my
bag upstairs I'll show you that a little
bit later and as usual my accessories I
watched I took my earrings out so we're
getting it home with painful but that's
pretty much all I'm accessorizing with
it is now and today has been one of
those busy days filled with meetings so
this whole morning I've been
back-to-back meetings and just now I've
just done a panel
really interesting I love my surround
marketeers about the influence of
I just have to get our Japanese right
now I'm at Covent Garden and just
absorbing all the festivities it is
absolutely fusible the Christmas tree
band playing is probably here in the
background it's just decorated so so
beautifully I'm going to have a little
look around the trucks here now I'm
going to my second company I'm
and then a couple meetings
tonight the event I'm going to an
evening with record an egg they're doing
a little collaboration so I will be
taking your lungs that should be an
evening on Swedish style
today
okay so I've made my way to the South
Bank Centre which is that you can
imagine on the south bank we've got the
London Eye to that side of me over the
river you can't receive at the Somerset
House just one of my favourite areas of
London it's looking beautifully faceted
with all the lights up I'm now going to
make my way to the record league winter
Lodge I think is officially called and
Villa Capri explains over basically
there's a pop-up and it's open starting
from now I will leave the exact date
that it's opened down below because I'm
pretty sure you might want to come and
visit if you happen to be in London over
the next few weeks or so tonight is the
launch event so I'm very excited to see
what it looks like and show you guys so
let's make our way to the lodge and give
it a try
repose acknowledged I believe in here
would explain as you can see I have
changed into ride Swedish style out of
the day
style
getting into Swedish way of life is
evening actually funny story when
Charlie first
and a collection really nicely it was
really good as well
hey won't you pour me another I'm gonna
need so wish me good luck yeah I've
gotta put on my favorite song I need a
boost let's turn up the love it is way
too late but I just can't get my eyes of
you maybe we will regret this but
tomorrow is another day
nice
which is a very fine
the event
I'm gonna go get these mountains
so I will do anything I will do anything
to me I need booze
on the great job is that sure they
she does it a little bit nervous
and yeah so we've got our Swedish food
we narrowly missed our meat that the
meatballs are all gone annoyingly but I
am on to my second month of these spies
from Reuters I've actually got a new
favorite drink alone
oh it's so easy they've been giving out
they've been giving out little cars
which tell you how to make cocktails
billions of recording sizes one of
is with that rhubarb cider and that's
the truth I was drinking earlier so I'm
gonna definitely be making this
cocktails at home and actually leave one
if there is interception
[Laughter]
which is one rather enjoying if I do say
so it's a limited edition which is
available until February so a little bit
longer to enjoy that one I think we
should get something else for Christmas
Christmas sorted good morning it is
Friday and today is going to be a very
chilled working from home day as you can
probably tell by the outfit of the day
Friday I have been joined by my
favorites handsome little boy um so yes
today my to-do list is the longest I
think has ever been I need about four
days in order to do all of the things
goes on today's to-do list kissing
kissing Dexter is my top priority of
course so the reason why I've got so
much to do is because we've got some
friends coming over tonight and I want
to cook some fairly nutritious things in
the Thermomix
two of our friends are doing no sugar
and no kind of like pre-made food
throughout the whole of November so I'm
going to use the Thermomix recipe for
the cacao pistachio and raspberry
brownies because they're actually quite
healthy and no sugar so I'm going to
prepare those recipes now and then
tomorrow I am doing my charity sale for
lots of my clothing so I need to prepare
all of that and then on Monday we are
having our walking wardrobes starting to
be built which means the
that it's being built anew to be totally
empty and that's gonna be quite a big
challenge added on to that I just have
tons of blog posts I need to write
Christmas content Black Friday content
to get through a couple of videos to
edit I'm going to start editing this one
and I've got blog amount to pick up
except except us so loads and loads of
things on my to-do list today so first
of all I'm gonna look on the cookie do
website and choose some recipes to cook
I know I've showed you these bits before
I'm going to show you quickly Congress
is so amazing and this is one of the
reasons why I love our thermomix this is
the Thermomix website it's called cookie
doom or the cookie do section of the
website and it's got loads of recipes on
it I have chosen the white chocolate
pistachio and a raspberry brownies I
click on that and then when I add it to
my favorites by clicking here it
automatically sends it to my machine so
then my machine will do the recipe on it
and I can just follow it step by step
weighs it out and everything like that
these are the ingredients so I've just
added those on to my shopping list and
we are ready to go it's a few hours
later
we've just got back from Donal and big
Sainsbury's a shop I'm now gonna make
the chocolate brownies so I will show
you briefly just how easy it is just in
case you haven't seen me using my snazzy
fella mix before I have done a whole
blog post on it on how much I love it so
I'll leave that link down below as well
but basically this is the gadget and
using this snazzy device which is called
a cookie and this is basically what
makes it Wi-Fi enabled and has all the
recipes connected to it and this is a
recipe that I showed you online earlier
I added it to my favourites and now it's
on my device and basically I just scroll
through this following the instructions
so it's already told me to turn my oven
on and line a baking tray and next is
telling me to put in 150 grams of dark
chocolate so here is my dark chocolates
and as you can see it also has the
weighing scales so I put the chocolate
in there and then see what the next
instruction is
so after a little bit more time in the
thumb makes a few more ingredients the
brownies are in the tin and I'm just
adding some fresh raspberries
these are raspberry white chocolate and
pistachio brownies gluten-free because I
use food and free flour oh my god this
is gonna be served as day
so the brownies are in the oven I'm now
making the pea and mint soup my eyes are
watering a bit from the onions I
basically and just have to chop an onion
into quarters and then the Thermomix is
doing the rest it's currently sauteing
I'm chopping them and one thing that is
a bit of a game-changer for me and if
you are a serial multitasker the best
thing is instead of standing there
chopping or sauteing a frying pan
I can now be doing my tidying up while
the Thermomix spends three minutes doing
that for me so I'm just gonna carry on
doing the pea and mint soup these
brownies are slowly but surely rise them
in the oven and I'll catch up with you
guys a little bit later on when
everything is roasted finished so the
brownie is now out of the oven and it is
looking and smelling amazing we've got
some little bits of white chocolate
which can be nice and gooey raspberries
and pistachios sticking out the top and
then in here I'm just gonna leave it in
here for now there's my pea and mint
soup and then when that we are ready to
eat
I'll just heat it up again so my starter
and my dessert are all done now all
we've got to do we've got this is our
mandrel by the way has anyone else seen
that Michael McIntyre sketch where he
talks about the mandrel batteries of
indeterminate use currency that's no
longer in circulation I love this around
gaffer tape okay you don't owe me
darling anyway and this is this is a
gentleman's essential now the dumps no
for the Effie echo yeah okay it is now
the evening well it's about five o'clock
it feels so much later because it is
pitch black outside we had a knock at
the door about an hour ago and this
ginormous
stocking has arrived and I think it's
from the body shop so I thought I would
open it up with you the house is looking
fairly festive considering we don't have
many Christmas decorations that we've
got all our like Christmas candles and
poinsettia which we just got from
Sainsbury's
just been joined by two little men as
well hey baby
I love you so I am going to prop the
camera up on the dining table and show
you what is in my ginormous stocking
oh my goodness this literally feels like
what I got for Christmas video it's
absolutely huge I'm gonna move this
actually because I do worry about
getting my hair button on candles okay
can you see you can't see but Dexter's
here my little man oh my goodness is a
few like boxes in here I think this is
very exciting
Wow totally spoiled it is their spa of
the world range this is one of the
Christmas gift sets not sure what scent
this is but it says it's the firming
ritual so I guess it's going to be a
selection of firming products okay we
have got the French grapeseed refining
body scrub and Ethiopian green coffee
firming body cream that is what's inside
in this lovely gift set and as I'm sure
you know the boys shop they're all about
community trade so all of these
ingredients or most of these ingredients
will have been sourced using community
trade very ethical of course so for
example the Ethiopian coffee cream I
think they sauce well obviously from
Ethiopia but they work with the local
communities in these areas to source of
things source the ingredients very
responsibly I can't get out but I've
spoken to you guys about these scrubs
from the spire of the world range before
absolutely love them they're very like
melt on the skin full of lovely oils
just absolutely heavenly so that is a
beautiful gift set and cute body shop do
Josie Merry Christmas and thank you for
all of your support here's to a great
2018
love from the body shop team to cute
little Christmas gift card on the front
there next up is one of their ball balls
this one I think is the vanilla scented
one if I remember correctly and vanilla
chai festive tin such a good gift idea
inside a hat
now this is my favorite like size
because you can travel and you've got
enough for like a week but it's still a
trouble size so it's good for testing
out any new ranges can you see the
texture is like clinging on to no so
this is the vanilla chai shower gel
which I don't think I've tried before
body butter
everybody loves the body shop body
butters this is a Oh exfoliating sugar
body scrub that will definitely be
coming with me on my Christmas holiday
and then we've got a little a hand cream
as well so really nice way of trying out
the range I keep thinking I've got the
last thing and then I find more this is
absolutely incredible very very generous
oh wow oh my goodness
game-changing seasonal gift collection
when you play with us you're not only
doing a bit for the planet by upcycling
your packaging you're also helping us
and international alerts and joy love
and compassion some of the world's most
vulnerable people every gift you buy
from our seasonal collection helps
support the peace play project in
Lebanon for a year which provides a safe
space for children to play and he'll
find out more at the body shop comment /
play - 4 - piece that is amazing I
actually mentioned that in my advent
calendar video the good that the body
shop are doing with their packaging this
year and and this is one of the things
that they've brought out to show that I
think it's just a board game just to
enjoy a little bit of silliness
throughout the festive season
I will leave more information about
their play for peace in the description
box down below because it's such a
lovely initiative and it's also nice to
give someone something knowing that
you're giving back at the same time and
sometimes I feel like people appreciate
that part of the gift more than the
actual gift - so all done body shop
that's what we all know and love you for
the most this last one is rather
spectacular beautifully presented I
actually have no clue what is inside
this it says the share Shea share share
sh EA ultimate collection Grand Lux
Karachay I don't know how to pronounce
that correctly let's see if we can get
into this it ones inside here I am
treated with this is a full size and
body butter I think this is just a Shea
one and yeah
a nourishing body butter this is
probably one my favorite all-time
products it's just ah so good on winter
dry skin if you got any holidays so
nourishing and smells amazing so that's
going straight in my to pack box and
then it's also if I hadn't messed it up
by dropping it really beautifully
presented inside looks like this you've
got a little fragrance by the looks with
a hand cream I think this is a little
exfoliating sugar scrub oh my goodness
totally it totally it's spoilt by the
body shop so thank you to the body shop
team if you're watching so now I'm going
to go upstairs make myself look decent
tidy the house a little bit because we

under two hundred guests that came to
shop our bits and bobs for charity so I
was incredible I also got to meet some
of you guys which I wasn't really
expecting some viewers from as far away

Christmas and made the time out of their
holidays to come and say hi so I was
very very thankful that you came along
