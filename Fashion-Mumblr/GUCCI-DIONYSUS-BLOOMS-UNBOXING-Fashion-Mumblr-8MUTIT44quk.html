youtube channel today's video I have
been extremely excited to film for you
because it's actually going to be my
first ever unboxing video I know I've
shared unboxings in vlogs before but as
I absolutely loved watching these proper
sit-down and boxing videos I thought I
would do one for you guys today
for my new Gucci purchase I knew that's
spoiling the surprise but you already
know it is from the title anyway and
probably my snapchat - so the Gucci bag
that I've ordered has come from Gucci
com
I purchased it maybe like five days ago
and he arrived yesterday but before that
I had gone to the Gucci store on New
Bond Street to try out a few bags I
think I I really fell in love with the
dollars this bag after seeing it up
close and personal a few weeks ago on
one of my blogger friends and before
that I'd always been aware of it but I
wasn't sure if it was for me but it was
when I saw it up close that I just
absolutely fell in love so I went to the
Gucci store and I tried on a few
different designs I tried on a few
different sizes the dialysis bag comes
in small medium and large and I
absolutely love the small but because I
have the beautiful Valentino bag which
is about this big I thought they were
just too similar and I have been
thinking about treating myself to a new
everyday handbag and that's pretty much
what this is going to become hopefully
so I did end up going for the large size
the medium I just wasn't a huge fan of
the shape is a little bit longer and I
thought I fit less into it so for an
everyday handbag the larger is pretty
much my my immediate choice so I just I
can't even talking you might need to
just open it because it is still in its
box this is literally how it arrived so
I'm going to open it from its postal box
so you can see how the Gucci and online
orders come I guess okey-dokey this is
very exciting okay so we are inside the
box and in
it just wow this is pretty loud it's
just fairly beautiful from the offset
I've got this big black and white Gucci
box and a envelope of Gucci envelope
so let's I'm just presuming this as my
receipt yeah receipts returns label and
this mini Gucci envelope thank you we
look forward to assisting you again on
Gucci com so just a little kind of
compliment slip I mean I will definitely
be keeping this scooch it envelope that
is very very snazzy alright so I'm going
to lift this box out of its box ok so
inside that box
was another box this is like the best
version of pass the parcel ever and it
is this humongous Gucci box which I will
definitely be keeping I'm a little bit
upset that it's actually a little bit
battered it's bit ripped on the corners
and I guess that's probably just from in
transit but it's just absolutely
stunning I love this cream of black
color scheme they've got going on I just
look so luxurious and this Fucci ribbon
with Gucci embossed on it is just
absolutely stunning I have to say though
this black and creme and packaging kind
of reminds me of Reese I know that Reese
obviously did it after Gucci but
definitely sprung to mind so I'm going
to go ahead and try not to drop it while
I'm doing this bow
so beautiful okay let's see what's
inside the box
thumper okay inside this ginormous box
it's just far too big for the bag I
guess they have like one box size all
their bags is the dust bag I have to say
this is a very luxurious dust bag it's
almost silky definitely nicer than the
quality of the dust bags that a lot of
other designer bags that I've seen and
comment especially like my Valentina
when it was almost like a rough material
but this is very silky I do always keep
my dust bags for storage I've never
resold a designer bag but I guess if I
ever did want to resell one it would be
really useful to have the dust bag and I
also use them a lot when I'm traveling
so I always keep my bags in their dust
bags when I travel I always take my hand
bags in my hand luggage because I just
couldn't bear the thought of them going
missing so yeah the dust bag is this
white or off-white silky material with a
Gucci bag on edge on the front and then
it's got a black drawstring and inside
I'm so so excited for this okay we're
starting to see the baby
it's got his protective wrap on it and
there we go I can't believe she's mine
this is just absolutely stunning
oh wow well oh wow okay so this is the
Gucci blooms of Duras this bag I should
probably double-check that I'm pretty
sure that's right it's definitely the
door it says and I think this pattern is
the glooms but if I've got that wrong I
will write it on the screen right now so
it is um well let me just take a little
bit more of the wrapping off so that we
can have a look
properly inside there's lots of
protective padding which I'm going to
remove from your take actually I'll
leave that padding in so that we can see
the good shape okay so packaging off and
here she is in all her beautiful glory
this is obviously the darkness with the
floral design on it and I did think long
and hard about whether to get this one
or the plain one which doesn't have the
red color here it's I think it's just a
light topi shade and but I just felt
that the florals was a little bit more
unusual but without being too bold I
don't when I buy a designer bag I don't
like to go for the megatrend ones
because I can't afford to keep buying
new designer bags every time a new trend
comes out and once it goes out of
fashion I feel like I probably would be
less inclined to use it and I love to
get a lot of use out of my designer bags
so I thought this was classic but with a
beautiful feminine touch which is just
so me I almost felt like the plain one
was a little bit too cool for me so I'm
really glad I got the one with the
floral design on it I just feel like
it's very girly and very very me and
just a little bit different to the
standard one um so yes as you can see
it's got this really beautiful chunky
chain I will insert some close-ups
and I think the chains really fab length
for putting over your shoulder I'm quite
petite so the fact that it's not too
long is really really fabulous for me
again I'll show a close-up of where it
hangs on my body and then of course you
can double the straps up if you want to
have it just over your shoulder and
tucked under your arms a really lovely
length of chain really sturdy thick
chain as well which is great I think if
there's any thinner it could potentially
dig in a little bit and as it will be my
everyday handbag it's going to have a
lot of stuff in it so it's really
important that the chain is a
comfortable chain if that makes sense
on the back there's even more of this
beautiful floral design it's almost a
bit of a shame that it's hidden on the
back there because that's actually the
most stunning part of it where all the
detail is and when I went into the shop
I actually asked if this was
hand-painted because it definitely looks
as though someone has done a watercolor
design on the bag and for the price
which is fourteen eighty I kind of think
they could have done hand painting but
it's not it's actually a printed design
but I don't love it any last because of
that I just I just think that's it's
stunning and then you have a little bit
of a floral detail on the front so this
is the iconic diamond assist clasp and
all the bags in the Gucci Adonis's range
have this class I think that all the
same size I'm not sure the smaller bags
for smaller class but it really is quite
iconic it's almost I think needs a tiger
heads which I'm not I'm not really sure
the relevance of this is but that's like
a snake with two tiger head to make
their lion heads and also I did look up
what Dionysus meant and I think it would
be pronounced Dionysus but he was the
Greek god of the wine harvest or like
the grape harvest and he was the Greek
god with in Greek mythology of
winemaking so I guess that relates quite
nicely to this wine colored suede in the
intersection so the opening is a little
push button I actually thought it was a
magnetic a you know magnetic would you
call them physical routing things that
they magnetically kept in but actually
it's a push button so I push it it pins
open so riester D clasp and then inside
you've got this big expanse of the
burgundy wine color which continues
inside the bag then you've got a flap of
the suede here and inside that flap
there is a very slim pocket so good for
maybe my oyster card a little notebook
perhaps and then I'm going to take the
packaging out
there we go so you can see inside most
of it is this wine colored suede and
then you've also got the main material
on the sides two big compartments and
then one zippy compartment in the middle
which has got to let's see
bit paperwork in it there's a random
little swatch of the fabric not too sure
why they include that maybe if you
wanted to like match it to something I
guess if you put a colored bag it may be
handy to have this at all
trying to match your bag with your shoes
that's quite a little nice little touch
that's a random bit of paper that says
Gucci on it la puerta de la Prada
okay I think that means product details
Gucci products are manufactured by
experienced Italian artisans with
carefully selected materials the highest
quality this is basically a guarantee
and I think the other one is the
guarantee in a different language
there's no um like phone pockets in here
so there's nowhere to just slip your
phone in so I guess I'll just have to
shrug my phone into one of these main
pockets but because it's not a ginormous
bag I'm pretty sure I won't lose it I
think this is a really really good size
for everyday it's not massive so
hopefully I won't be tempted to fill it
with a load of rubbish but I think it's
a really perfect size for an everyday
handbag so yes I'm so excited to start
using this it's just absolutely
beautiful and then I'm on the sides
you've got this almost fan detail which
helps the bag out I guess when it's more
full but it does hold its shape really
really nicely this material here is
don't actually know what it is I thought
when I first saw it that it was going to
be leather and I'm sure it is leather
but it's
um it's coated which I think will make
the bag a lot more long-lasting and
hard-wearing it shouldn't pick up
scratches or get dirt on it it's almost
white clean which i think is really
really good for an everyday handbag
because hopefully make it a lot more
versatile I also just realized that the
normal dinosaur spice have a suede patch
on the back but actually one of the
girls I know that has it isn't a fan of
that suede patch because if you wear
denim the suede patch on the back can
pick up the color and I know one I used
to work at Mulberry any light colors
we'd get so many complaints because of
people had it rubbing against a dark
colored fabric it would pick up the
color and it just made the bag look old
quite quickly so I'm really pleased that
actually this one is a smooth coated
leather all over the back so hopefully
you'll remain looking perfect for a
really long time so there we go that is
my beautiful new Gucci Darnassus a
handbag I hope you guys enjoyed unboxing
it with me if you did then let me know
because if I do treat myself to any more
bags in the future or luxury purchases
she's or whatever do let me know if you
enjoy the unboxings I will do more of
this type of video if it's something
that you guys enjoy as I'm sure you guys
know this was a very well thought out
purchase is definitely not something
that I just decided to buy on the cuff
of a moment such a phrase on the square
at the moment and and it's something it
really is an investment piece Oh
something that I'm sure I'm going to get
tons and tons of Utah's use out of
and I think it's a really classic design
so hopefully can be my everyday handbag
for a long long time to come
so cost per wear hopefully it will be
really really good with this bag so
excited to start using it really hope
