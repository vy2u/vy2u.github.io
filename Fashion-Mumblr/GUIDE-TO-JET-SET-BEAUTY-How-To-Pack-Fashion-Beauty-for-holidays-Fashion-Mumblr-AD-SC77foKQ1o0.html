Jet Set beauty I'm going to share with
you some packing and beauty tips for the
glamorous traveler and today's video is
in collaboration with l'occitane alright
let's get started I filmed a guide to
packing carry-on bags for budget
airlines a little while ago so I'll
leave that one link down below but for
this trip
I needed something a little bit bigger
the first thing I always do is check the
weather for my destination especially in
the evening temperatures to see how much
it cools down with this in mind I plan
my outfits right down to the accessories
by making outfit decisions in advance it
minimizes the amount of clothes and
accessories I take with me as well as
making my decisions on what to wear each
morning a whole lot easier I pack my
essentials in a safe pouch that are easy
to find including currency my passport
and flight information
I hate being without my favourite
products when I'm abroad so I'm heading
to the L'Occitane website to pick out my
essentials here you can pick minis of
body care skin care fragrance and hair
care and so much more so you won't be
stuck without the necessities wherever
you're jetting off to with the purchase
of three or more you can even choose a
beautiful pouch to keep all your travel
minis safe I pack all my toiletries
together in the pouch so they're easily
accessible and then ensure I packed all
of my other essentials if you're a
regular jet setter you may like to
create a list on your phone of all the
things you need with you just to double
check it each time you fly for me this
includes my adapters my cameras a tripod
this particular type is every youtubers
best friend charges and of course a chic
pair of sunglasses
slogan hats are a big trend this summer
but they're not easy to pack I like to
fill the hat with fabric pieces
including a tote bag I always take one
with me when I travel as they're so
handy for laundry or if you have to
carry any extras with you on your way
home I pack the hat first and then fill
in my case around it ensuring my
garments a rolled to avoid any creases
and this also creates more space I fill
my shoes and bags with things like socks
lenses cables and any extras just to
maximize on space
all right we're all packed it's time to
fly a short flight and a helicopter
journey later and we've arrived in Monte
Carlo I can't wait to get into the Sun
so I grab an outfit and refresh my
skincare
luckily my cosmetics are all to hand and
I cleanse with the immortal oil makeup
remover in silky soft and gentle but
also removes the impurities that have
built up over a day and it reaches the
skin with essential oils to smooth and
calm the skin
next to help my skin recover from the
dry air on the flight I apply the lock
stunt Flash moisture mask it quenches
the skin and the peony extract and
glycerin really nourish and plump the
skin bringing back your glow while it
works its magic I take in that beautiful
view
before applying my makeup I like to use
the perfecting cream to moisturize the
skin and create a perfect canvas for the
day ahead it helps my skin look fresh
and rested with an immediate radiance
boost for the body I apply L'Occitane
ultra rich body lotion the share button
nourishes while the calendula extract
soothes the skin honey and sweet almond
extracts also adds the moisturization
perfect for parched or post-flight skin
I finish with one of my handbag
essentials the L'Occitane arm and hand
cream the fragrance is absolutely
delicious and perfectly soothes and
softens the hams
now it's time to enjoy the sunshine I
really hope you've enjoyed today's video
and if your jet-setting anytime soon I
hope you enjoy your trip and bon voyage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
