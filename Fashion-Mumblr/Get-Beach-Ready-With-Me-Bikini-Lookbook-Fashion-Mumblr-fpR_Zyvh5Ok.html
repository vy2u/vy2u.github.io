because I'm filming this video from
beautiful Costa Rica outside on my
balcony on a hammock I know pretty crazy
so sorry if the lighting isn't perfect
or if you can hear a bird squawking in
the background but I'm in the middle of
nature there's nothing I can do about
that so today at the plan is to head to
the beach so I thought I would do a get
beach ready with me video for you and
also show you some of my beach
essentials and maybe give you some beach
clothing ideas as well so when getting
ready to go to the beach the first thing
obviously is my makeup so the first
thing that I apply is a piste win factor
30 face lotion because I don't want to
get any kind of burn on my face and to
be honest my face and tan that well
anyway so I'm not too bad about putting
a high factor on my face the first bit
of makeup that I apply it is Tarte
rainforest of the sea concealer this is
quite a new one which I'm trying out and
it's quite full coverage but I don't
like to have under-eye circles at any
time let alone when I'm on the beach so
this is really good one for that and I
also apply it to any areas of redness on
my face and then I go in with a really
light foundation currently I'm
with a gale and terra cotta jolly teint
now this is a really lovely sunkissed
glow in foundation it gives a really
nice healthy glow also keeps looking
really good as the day goes on so even
if it on the beach you're getting a
little bit hot I find it still looks
really really good it just gives you a
nice healthy flow and really good
coverage which doesn't slide around
which is so important when you're on the
beach next I'll do my eyebrows and I
won't neither have Sunday my eyebrows
are no surprise I'm going to use the
Anastasia brow is this as of course when
I use nearly every day so no change
there for the beach and then I'm going
to apply really light and kind of
sparkly eyeshadow from the zoeva palette
this has become my favorite palette
recently and I took it with me to Costa
Rica I'm just using a really light shade
across my eyelid it's nothing special
here just to give a little bit of a nice
glow and then one piece which I never
change
in my beach beauty routine is my
waterproof mascara and this is the
Clarins ultra waterproof in intense
black this has become my holy grail go
to each essential because it's so
waterproof it literally does not go
anywhere once you apply this to your
lashes I like to also put a little bit
of balm on my lips before I head to the
beach and so I'm using
the new Tarte lip balms in the shade
nude I've never tried Tarte lip balms
before I love the packaging of this one
it's got a little gold and pink shells
on it and I really like the kind of
monthly feeling it gives on the lips
over the table and then the last makeup
that I apply is a little bit of bronzer
and again I'm using an ill and
terracotta bronzer I actually wore this
one with me because it's a really small
compact a lot of my other bronzers are
just really really huge I also love
really natural glow this one goes it's
not too dark but it just gives my skin a
little bit of color before I hit the
beach later when I'm on the beach I'll
apply a clarence jolly Rouge lipstick
I've got shade 20 which is coral with
tulip and I just really like the color
of this when it's got a lovely balmy
texture so it's nice and moisturizing
and it just gives a nice pop of color to
my lips during the day so that's the
makeup that I will do when I head to the
beach I might change around the products
a little bit but the majority of the
bits that I use such as foundation with
SPF in it it doesn't really change that
much
so other Beach beauty essentials of
course include Sun cream and I'm a big
fan of his wing of course that's the
reason why I'm here in Costa Rica and I
like to apply maybe a one day lotion at
the beginning of the day and then I have
a couple of favorites here which I also
like to take in my beach bag so the
first one is this one which is their new
protective cool refreshing Sun moves and
this
back to 30 but also got back to 15 and
when you pump this out it's really
cooling refreshing mu so it's nice to
cool you down a little bit during the
day as well as giving you some sun
protection and then for later on in the
holiday I've also got their tannin
protect tan accelerating oil spray in
factor 15 so because it's not oil it
really helps you to turn a little bit
more getting more intense tan but I
don't tend to use this until I've been
in the Sun for a few days but my skin is
used to the Sun so next I thought I'd
tell you about some of the essentials I
keep in my beach bag and on this trip my
beach bag is actually this rock sack
which I picked up from accessorize I
just thought it would look really nice
and it was a little bit battered and the
rucksack part that's coming in really
handy because we're doing a few walks in
tracks as well so this is a beach bag a
few of my essentials include some
sandals and I've been loving these ones
recently they are from Topshop and I
just really love this kind of metallic
strap and flip-flop so they're really
secure on the feet but also I think you
look really really chic and nice and
flattering as well I've also got my
sunglasses I always bring a couple of
pair of sunglasses it's slightly more
expensive pair this is a pair of
aviators from Ray Ban that look a little
bit like this and then I've also got a
Topshop pair which I'm kind of wearing a
see which I won't be too upset if I lose
but these obviously are a little bit
more valuable so I tend to always bring
two pairs of sunglasses to the beach
also in my bag I have my phone for
obvious reasons I don't ever really go
anywhere without it and then also my
vlogging camera which is the canon g7x
as I said my Olympus is currently being
fixed I'm really really liking at this
one at the
locking then I have my beach purse and
this is the Kate Spade one which picked
up and sample say a little while ago and
I've got a few of dollars and Costa
Rican currency in here as well because
you never know what you might want to
buy on the beach I also have my Apple
headphones because I love to just put in
some music and drown out the rest of the
world and I'm sunbathing so this is
really good just a cheap pair of
headphones to keep in my beach bag and
then I also have a few kind of cheap
accessories in here as well so this is a
pretty necklace which I got from I think
accessorized and then a little bracelet
which I got from new look and a really
cheap I think this is a Primark hand
clip and I just find these and a little
bit firmer to a beach look but they're
not too expensive and nothing's going to
get ruined
one thing that absolutely saves my hair
when I'm on the beach is this and it's
the Charles Wellington that sunshine
protection even spray I don't have to
use isn't even spray but more leave-in
conditioner so when I come out the sea
ice princess all over and it really has
to untangle and then I've got a travel
hairbrush in there as well and this not
only does the U key protecting and
untangling also stops my hair from
growing a funny colour in the Sun this
is definitely each bag essential and
finally I'll probably have a book or a
magazine in there but on this trip we
are just too busy for me to do any of
that so I don't have a book or magazine
with me but I usually would and then the
last thing is
mini face the breath spray because this
just adds a little bit more strides when
you come at the scene and also it's
really cooling and refreshing since
they're instant boost to skin tonic and
I also love to use this one on the
aeroplane so it's kind of 2 for price of
one so now I'm going to show you a few
of my favorite bikinis and outfits to
wear to the beach so hopefully it gives
you some inspiration and of course I'll
leave all the links down below if you
wanted to go and check any of them out
for yourself
