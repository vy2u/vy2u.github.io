fast-paced crowded but it's my home
today's get ready with me is for a day
in London I hope you enjoy it
it's going to be a busy day so I start
with a coffee make it a strong one I
take my coffee into the bathroom where
my skincare routine will begin first I
wash my face using my nizzle cleanse and
polish I massage it in before rinsing it
off with a warm flannel the first
product that I'm going to apply is
Elizabeth Arden Super Start serum it
boosts my skin's natural defenses
helping my skin to renew itself it helps
the rest of my skin care products really
do their job next I'm applying the
provide serum mainly for anti aging it
also helps to shield from environmental
aggressors it also helps to improve the
look of some damaged skin next my eye
cream Sara Chapman's the skin uses eye
recovery it encourages the formulation
of collagen and it helps reduce
puffiness too great for concealing the
late night last night then I apply my
sara chapman skin uses dynamic defence

another step in my anti-aging routine
and also protects the skin with SPF 15

city it shields my skin from pollution
and protects against visible signs of
aging the perfect product for a day in
London
now it's time to do my makeup the first
thing I apply is a current be be skin
detox cream
it's a beautiful light formula and I
love that it leaves my skin actually
looking like skin while protecting it at
the same time I blend this in using my
Beauty Blender slightly damp for a
beautiful flawless coverage then I erase
those under eye circles using my Bobbi
Brown serum concealer once again using
that same Beach blender to blend it into
my skin and make sure it lasts all day
I'm using enormous heat loose powder
just lightly to set my concealer and
then set the rest of my base I'm adding
a pop of color to my eyelids using the
lighter shade for my new stealer palette
and applying this using a silver
blending brush and then the darker shade
to my crease to really make the eye
contour stand out
then I'm going to fill in my brows using
benefits for our pencil this one's a
perfect match my brow color and the
pencil makes it look really natural
and then to contour and add some shape
to my face and using Tom Ford's bronzer
it's incredibly natural color we use it
to contour and add warmth to my face
then I'm curling my lashes with my
tweezers and lush colors and apply
mascara the Clarins mean Brown mascara
for a natural look it volumizes and
separates lashes perfectly without
leaving it looking too heavy as you
sometimes get with black mascara then I
get dressed before adding the finishing
touch to my makeup look my lipstick Tom
Ford first time
finally I apply my fragrance today I'm
using Jerome pinion brush 3 I turn on my
straighteners and run my hands through
my hair before starting to add some
curls I'm using the shows routing dry
shampoo just add little volume and
texture to my hair and brushing it
through and using my tangle teezer then
I take small sections at a time and curl
my hair around my stylus these are the
new GHD platinum electric pink stylus I
find them perfect for curls I continue
this all around my head before running
my hands through my hand to make it look
even more natural
