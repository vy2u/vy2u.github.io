channel I hope you're all really well
and having a fabulous day today in this
video I thought I would share with you a
kind of autumnal get ready with me I
don't want to call it a makeup tutorial
because I don't think of myself as a
makeup artist or a pro at doing my
makeup so it's really just for you to
see how I do my makeup on day one it's
just a little bit more than an everyday
makeup routine so I wouldn't necessarily
do my makeup like this every day in fact
I definitely wouldn't it's more of a
long lasting a high coverage and just
very wearable or tunnel makeup look
using a mixture of high street and
high-end products if you are new to my
channel then the hello welcome and I
would love it if you would subscribe for
more beauty and fashion and travel
lifestyle vlogs tons and tons of videos

at the moment I'm doing vlog Toba so a
video every single day whether that's a
chatty video or a get ready with me or a
shopping haul there's a video every day
so if you don't want to miss out then
please do subscribe and this video is
going to start with the skincare that I
used first thing this morning all the
way through to this finished look so
without further ado enjoy I've already
cleansed my face this morning and I used
a new product this is the dr. server
Rose de vie creme cleanser and I really
like the formula of this I find it
really gentle but also feels like it's
nice and nourishing on my skin which
this time of year my skin absolutely
loves and because it is a rose product I
just absolutely love
of this so all I've done so far this
morning is cleanse my skin so the next
part of my morning skincare routine in
autumn is toning and I've been using the
fresh peony brightening moisturizing
facial toner and usually I find toners
can be a little bit stripping on the
skin a bit harsh but this one because it
is so moisturizing I find it a really
really nice formula so I just apply a
little bit of this onto a cotton pad I
love that this is a brightening formula
I find at this time of year we just kind
of need all the help we can get when it
comes to adding a bit of brightness and
luminosity to the skin and then I'm
going to be using the Amara Vicks or
Morrison's and I've really been getting
into using essences recently I just find
this time of year anything that you can
do to help your skin is a bonus so I put
a couple of drops of that onto my hands
and just Pat this onto my skin it feels
like water and it sinks in pretty much
straightaway and I've been told that
essences help the rest of your skincare
do its job so really nice the idea of
that and then because I'm quite obsessed
with my pores at the moment and I'm
doing everything in my power to make
them smaller I've recently been trying
the Clinique poured finding solutions
correcting serum and I haven't really
been using this long enough to tell you
whether it works or not but I am willing
to be optimistic about it
so just applied one pump of that and
spreading it over my face just in my
hands and then it's eye cream I'm aware
there are so many steps in my kind of
skincare when it comes to autumn but I
feel like you just need to help your
skin combat the cold and dry weather in
any way possible and the eye cream that
I'm using is from a company called at
NeoStrata
and I picked this up in one of those
French pharmacies is the Wigmore Street
pharmacy and it has actually been doing
a lot of good for my under eye circles
so I'm just passing
this on and not too close to the actual
I just kind of keeping to the bone area
and just gently passing that in so I'll
usually leave this part of my skincare
routine to kind of settle in for a
couple of minutes while I go and put the
kettle on make myself a cup of tea
ready to moisturize and then start my
makeup routine so the moisturizer that
I'm going to use today is the Estee
Lauder
revitalizing supremo plus global
anti-aging moisturizer and this one is
targeted for Millennials so 28 year olds
to really combat those first signs of
aging I think prevention is better than
cure is definitely what they're going
for with this range and if I can do
anything to stop my skin from aging then
I'm going to give it a go and it also
really likes the consistency of this it
feels thick and it feels like it sinks
in really quickly which I love because I
don't want to be hanging around for ages
waiting for my moisturizer to sink in
it's already been enjoying using this
one recently it's got quite a nice smell
to it as well it's not a strong smell
but it just feels nice and luxurious by
the way I'm sorry for my hair this
morning I was having one of those really
weird hair days but I don't really have
a parting it's like parting here and
here don't know what's going on so just
scraped it all back I do usually just
pile my hair in a bun when I'm doing my
makeup anyway so next is primer and I'm
using the Eve LOM flawless radiance
primer this one I find gives a little
bit of radiance to my skin but without
being too obvious if that makes sense
it's just a very lovely natural radiance
which I really like because as someone
with oily skin I'm always quite aware of
looking to doing so this one I find is
the perfect balance
and I just spread this again with my
fingers all over my face and then before
I get started on my actual makeup I'm
going to put on a little bit of lip balm
because my lips do get a bit dry at this
time of year and I'm going to use the
Giorgio Armani lip care this one's a
really lovely formula and slightly
tinted so just a really pretty color for
everyday we're popping in your Hamburg
etc okay and finally it is time to start
my makeup first of all because I want to
have quite a luminous base but not to do
a as I mentioned earlier I'm going to
use the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation but I'm also going to blend
it with a peachy one for a little bit of
extra coverage so I'm just using one
pump of the Giorgio Armani and popping
that on my face and then for the
additional coverage and long wear I'm
using the Vichy dermablend corrective or
resurfacing a16 alert foundation once
again just squeezing a kind of
two-thirds of a pea-sized amount onto my
hands and then once again dotting this
onto my face
and then I'm taking my Beauty Blender
which has swelled up big-time because I
rinse it under the tap earlier and I'm
just going to dab it in and the two
foundations blend together really really
nicely
and then once I've got a perfect base
from the foundation I'm taking two
different concealers to conceal because
I want this look to be really
long-lasting it's a Saturday morning and
I definitely want this to last right
throughout the day I'm using the Kat Von
D locket concealer and this is actually
my first time using it so I'm going to
give this a try on my chin I'm just
gonna press it on my chin because that's
an area where I find that my makeup
doesn't tend to hang around too long so
I've just been few dots of that on my
chin cutting in with my fingers and then
hopefully my makeup won't budge me in
that area and then I'm going to be using
the Too Faced Born This Way concealer
which is a little bit lighter just to
conceal and highlight on the rest of my
face
and then I'm just using my beauty
blender to blend that into my foundation
it's exact same sponge I used before no
point in changing or halfway through so
now that I finished all the I like to
call it the wet part of my face I'm
going to set all those products in place
with a powder and my favorite at the
moment is the shun Takei HD powder I've
got the bronze color and this doesn't
really add too much color but it really
sets the makeup with a little bit of
warmth and it gives a bit of a blurring
effect to some big fan of this one and I
just wiped that pretty much all over my
face making sure to pay attention to my
chin and under eyes as well so as you
can see because this base is very full
coverage I have lost all the sense of
shadow and contour on my face so now it
is time to bring that back with some
bronzer and contour first of all I'm
going to bronze with my hourglass
bronzing powder in ambient bronzed
luminous bronze light and I'm using a
sigma brush to do this and I always
start under the cheekbones because it
just helps to build that natural contour
and if you have too much color on your
brush it's very easily blendable in this
area too and then I bring it up over my
forehead and under my chin where the
face wouldn't actually have a bit of
shadow and then when I finished those
areas whatever's left on my brush I just
use to naturally bronze the rest of my
face and I start to feel a little bit
more human again at this stage next I'm
going to use some really subtle contour
and I'm going to be using another new
favourite of mine this is a Kat Von D
shade and light palette which looks like
this and I'm going to be using these two
shades on the end I'm not going full on
darker contour so I'm just swiping my
brush and this is actually a Marc Jacobs
flusher brush but I really like using
this for contour and then I'm going to
practice way to put it by sucking my
face in and then drawing like an L shape
so from here down to my mouth forehead
down tomorrow
and then finally softening by blending
them all together using my bronzing
brush once again okay I've brought you
in a little bit closer for brows and
this is a stage that makes me finally
you feel a bit more normal and I'm using
the Bobbi Brown long-wear brow gel I'm
going for really long wearing products
today because as I said I'm gonna be out
for today and then I'm using my zoeva
brow brush this one's got a really fine
pointed end and first of all I'm just
going to outline underneath where I want
my brows be the whole time I'm just
using really fine hairlike strokes just
because I don't want this to be too bold
and then once I'm happy with the line
underneath I'm just going to slowly
start feathering the brow cream through
the brow to build in that volume I
always start with the so called the bulb
area I always start with a bulb area
first just because I actually lack hair
in this area so it's good to start
building that up I find that then that
using a powder product almost sets the
brows in place and makes them look a bit
more natural and I found that one of the
shades from new Estee Lauder's sultry
nudes palette is pretty much my perfect
brow color so I'm using the same brush
I've have wiped the excess off on my
handbag and then just lightly putting a
little bit of this onto my brush and
then running that through my brows
and then the final thing I'm going to do
in the brow area is apply a little bit
of Bobby Brown's creamy concealer and
I'm also using a smoky liner brush which
is not what it's intended for you can
see I'm almost finished with this one
I'm just taking a small amount of this
on both sides of the brush and I find it
makes my brows look a lot more neat and
polished if I just run a little bit of
concealer underneath the brow next I'm
going to do my eye shadow and first of
all I'm going to create a really lovely
color that's going to wash all across at
the base from the salty new testing Lord
of palette and I'm going to use actually
the same one that I used for my brows
which is this lovely kind of mushroomy
brown color down here tapping off the
excess and then just wiping this all
over the lids is quite a greyish Brown
which I really really like such a
gorgeous or tunnel color and I think a
nice soft brown for balloons as well so
I've just put that on my lid and
extending it just a little bit over the
crease and then once I'm happy with that
I'm taking a very warm kind of orangey
Brown which is a little bit of shimmer
and it's also from these sultry mousse
and I'm actually going to focus this on
the outer corner and then just gradually
bring it in over the lid I find this
really adds a very nice subtle warmth
it's not a majorly intense eye look but
I've just really been enjoying using
this combination recently and then
before I do anything more I'm going to
use my zoeva blending brush just to
blend out those two colors so if you
wanted a more soft everyday look you
could definitely leave it here but I'm
actually obsessed with this almost
coppery reddish brown color in these
Wever new spectrum palette my little bit
see so I'm actually going to take that
and pop that almost in the same area as
the one before it is really helping to
deepen this autumnal color
so I'm really focusing this shade in the
crease and then also along
I'd say 3/4 of my eyelid too and then of
course blending this is really
satisfying it's really when you can see
the eye makeup look coming together if
the Sun goes away you might actually be
able to see what this looks like but
before I finish so I really don't spend
too long on my eye shadow because not
some makeup artist that can make it look
amazing so I don't waste too much energy
on it but I am going to put a little bit
of this lighter color just underneath
the brow bone and I feel like this
always really finishes it off really
beautifully so again a zoeva brush just
popping that under the brow bone
almost neatly off the edges with this
lighter color and that is pretty much
all I do for the eye shadow and I've
been really mixing around with the
colors from these two palettes to create
my everyday autumn eyeshadow look if I
want to add a pop of sparkle I have
recently just been so obsessed with this
Tom Ford palette this shade in
particular at the top is just a
beautiful brownie almost purpley pinkie
shimmer so I'm going to show you what
this looks like just adding a pop of
thats in the middle of the eyelid it's a
really beautiful very luxurious shimmer
so sometimes I would maybe add this step
in the evening if I just want to finish
the look and add a little bit more
sparkle next moving on to eyeliner and
recently I've been loving the Guerlain
eyeliner this one just has a most
beautiful packaging I think this popped
is absolutely gorgeous I'm always really
conscious to wipe away a lot of the
excess though because it can be a little
bit Valachi and then just aiming to
create a really thin line as close as
possible to my lash line
oh no you're right back need a cotton
pad when you do that or if you do that I
find the best thing to do is run and get
a cotton bud and then pop it in your
mouth wet it and quickly just wipe away
the area where you put your eyeliner and
then what I'm going to do is repeat the
final step from my eye shadow so just
our last step blending it all in to get
rid of any gray smudges so now I'm going
to move on to mascara and first I'm
going to use my trusty tweezerman
eyelash curlers just to gently curl the
lashes and I find this really helps to
just open my eyes a little bit more and
then I'm going to use my tart tart issed
mascara this is a very black shade which
I don't usually go for I usually am a
brown mascara person but this one's
really nice accreting long separated out
lashes
I normally like to do my blush after my
first layer of mascara sets because I
find the second coat of mascara goes on
a lot better if you've given your first
layer a chance to dry and I'm actually
going to try this intense pink color
from the Tom Ford palette so I'm going
to go very carefully because I feel like
it's gonna be very pigmented it's my
first time trying it and I'm using my I
think this is Sigma Sigma duo fiber
powder blush I'm just applying that to
the apples of my cheeks and up to my
hairline it's actually a lot softer than
I was expecting so I can go in a little
bit harder the next time then on my lips
I'm going to put the Seattle magic pouch
potion and this is a really mattifying
lip treatment so it will mattify out the
lip balm that I put on earlier so really
good for a long lasting and also
volumizing a lip finish the consistency
reminds me of when I used to put like
blistex lip treatment on when I had a
really really dry lips so very strange
consistency I apply it with the
applicator and then just Pat it in it
says it's for luminizing but I don't
really notice too much of a difference
with my lips volume but I do find it a
really lovely finish especially when I
put lip balm on before it really acts as
a primer giving my lipstick the best
chance it can have but lasting a long
time and I'm going to use two lip
products to get the color that I really
really like first of all this brand I
think I must have got it in a glossy box
or something so I'm not very familiar
with it but I really like the color as
diego de la palma and i just absolutely
love this formula and this color so it's
a matte lip cream and i'm just going to
apply this straight onto my lips
so as you can see that just applied so
so easily this applicator is really good
because it's got a point at the tip
which means you can really precisely
draw in your lip color it's also a
really good intense color so you only
need one coat and it completely fills
your lips with this color to be honest I
don't love this color so much I wear on
its own a lot but because I want to make
this look a little bit more autumnal I'm
going to use one of my armani second
skin intense max lip colors and this one
is slightly purpley and I don't love it
on its own but laid on top of a pink I
think it is such a gorgeous shade once
again a really lovely doe foot
applicator and I really really like the
packaging of this I think it's so
beautiful I'm not going to apply it too
much just tapping it on to just bring
down at the tone of the pink on my lips
at the moment
so there we go that is my lips done that
I absolutely love this combination I
have been reaching for it so so often on
days and I want to just look a little
bit more polished I find that the
Giorgio Armani is such a lovely matte
color on its own as I said not for me
but over the top of pink I think it's
such a lovely way of bringing my Pink's
down a notch and making them a little
bit more subtle and just such a gorgeous
autumnal shade a little bit purple or as
purple as I'm willing to go so big big
fan of that combination but before we
finish I have a few more finishing
touches so I want to make my lashes more
voluminous as I'm going in with the
Estee Lauder sumptuous and knockout
mascara this one again has a really
stiff brush so it's good for combing
through so really good for second
application because it doesn't allow you
mascara to get clunky but it still adds
in the volume and then I'm going to use
the ICO brow gel it just to finalize my
brows in case they've become dislodged
at any point during the process and I
like to have combed through brows I
don't like them to be patchy or anything
so I find that by doing this last just
ensures my brows are perfect before I
finish the look this has got a really
soft wand as well which is why I use
this one as my final brow product
because I find that it doesn't upset
what I've done before but it's still
just gently and softly combs through
them and makes them all perfected and
last but not least I'm using no less
than two makeup sprays which I know is
quite excessive but I am a big fan of
makeup sprays and the reason why I'm
doing two is because the Giorgio Armani
Armani prima this is a refreshing spray
so I find that if my makeup has become a
little bit tired or I just want to tap
it up a little bit I use this one and
then my ran one is
a anti-pollution mist on because I live
in the city I'm really conscious of
pollution going into my skin so I find
that by using the anti-pollution mist it
gives my skin the UV protection that he
needs for a day in the city so I just do
a couple of spritzes of each and then
I'm done so that is my finished kind of
everyday that slightly more glam than
everyday autumn makeup look I really
hope you guys enjoyed getting ready with
me and all that's left to do now is sort
out my bad hair day and that's it for me
