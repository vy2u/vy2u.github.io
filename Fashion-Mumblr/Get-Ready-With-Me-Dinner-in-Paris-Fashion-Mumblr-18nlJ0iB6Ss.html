regularly tonight we are getting ready
for a date night in the Paris I'm
starting off this evening through Tina
by cleansing my skin
I've actually got a mini micellar water
from the mare and this is one from the
la Mer GlossyBox collaboration I'm
absolutely loving trying out all the
products in their mini sizes next I'm
using the hydrating serum also from the
glossy box and popping some of that on
my fingertips rubbing my fingers
together and then delicately packing
that onto my chain skin next I'm
applying a little bit of eye cream also
from the mayor you can tell I just got
this and I'm really excited to try all
the products and it's a really nice way
of trying out a super luxurious brand
without having to splash out loads and
loads of money so yeah really impressive
this collaboration and then four times
in charm I'm using the non their iconic
moisturiser and this one apparently it's
a little bit different application wise
so what you have to do is pop it on your
fingers and then rub it together using
your fingertips for about a minute until
it goes from white to almost transparent
and then instead of rubbing it onto the
skin you actually have to pass it into
the skin to get the full benefit so
that's what I'm doing and then I'm going
to leave that to sink into my skin for
about 10-15 minutes or so while that
sinks in I'm going to enjoy a nice
cappuccino and we're staying at the limo
reefs hotel and it's probably one of the
best coffees I've ever tried so I'm
going to level my coffee and I'm trying
some Armani and maestro glow to really
give my complexion a bit of a radiance
boost it was so cold in Paris and I was
there I felt that all the radius to my
complexion had been thrown away so I'm
using that Charlie on the other hand is
also in need of a bit of a radiance
boost so he's popping on a sheet mask he
absolutely loves these and you'll see
who's the face mask in his youtube video
if you guys haven't seen that yet
I'll leave that link down below yeah
charlie is a big fan of pampering and
we're back to me I'm using also from
Giorgio Armani dang new power fabric
foundation this is actually only my
second or third time trying it and I'm
really impressed so far I'm actually
going to be applying that using a Beauty
Blender this is a new blush pink shade
and if you love it
I've wet it so expand it and soften and
then I'm putting the Foundation's eye
right now onto my skin and then really
buffing it in and using the Beauty
Blender I just I've tried so many
brushes recently but nothing really
comes close to the future Xander this
one obviously it does get quite marks
but I find it cleans quite easily so
really enjoying using that application
then it's a brighten the under eyes I'm
using my Tom Ford concealing pen this
one is so lovely and creamy and I find
it just melts into whatever foundation
I'm using as well as brightening the
under eye area
so I'm delicately passing it in with my
fingers and then I'm making sure blend
seamlessly with my foundation of by
blending with the Beauty Blender next of
course my favorite bronzer I'm using the
hourglass ambient light bronzer and my
Charlotte Tilbury bronzing brush this is
just my go-to combination if it's a
special night then I won't really bother
trying anything else it's just such a go
to sleep then I'm going to do my brows
so you guys know my brow routine by now
I'm not going to go into in too much
detail slip of coffee I'm basically just
using my usual Bobbi Brown grey
eyeshadow with the Anastasia slanted
makeup brush just to fill in the shape
of the eyebrows and then I'm using a
Rimmel brow gel
hi charlie I just set them in place
I am going for a pink eye look and I'm
totally obsessed with a sweet peach
palette I wasn't expecting to fall in
love with it as much as I have but I'm
using a mixture of pink and brown II
shimmery and matte shades to really
create a subtle kind of pinky brown
smokey I just absolutely love it and
then I put a little dab of the shimmery
ester shade in the middle just really
makes eyes sparkle and then asura
blending make sure it's all puffy seem
to give myself some lovely
fluttery flirty lashes I'm using
gallinula pirogue wah mascara really
good for separating out the lashes I'm
going to open curl the ends of my hair
using my GHD copper platinum stylist so
this is a Snoodle way I'll leave the
video links down below for full tutorial
and how I do my hair if you are
interested at this point charlie is
telling me to only have five minutes
until we've got to leave so I'm quickly
popping on my jewelry using my usual
bits and bobs again I'll leave them all
links down below and then I'm freshening
up the collection using a quarterly
spray and I'm putting a little bit of
ADHD serum just through the ends of my
hands to stop any flyaways and really
creates a smooth and polished look then
I'm using an urban became lip liner and
one of the new hourglass girl Eclipse
pillows which I adore they are so barmy
and the color range is just absolutely
gorgeous
finally I'm using a show Beauty hair
spray to set those curls in
I'm actually brushing through the curls
just to make them a little bit softer
for tonight and now I'm applying a V
Packer Rabanne and Olympia fragrance
this is such a gorgeous fragrance for a
date night it's really kind of sexy
musky and it lasts so long on the skin
I'm packing my bag of few beauty
essentials and then it's time to head
out so here is my outfit of the evening
we were at a beautiful Museum in Paris
this whole hallway was just absolute
bloggers goals it was this kind of pinky
marble so beautiful and as for me I'm
wearing my Valentino Rockford hills
which are just my all-time favorite shoe
searches and then these culottes are
from the Topshop I'll leave everything
linked down below my wife L bag and this
beautiful silk blouse is from Reef and
absolutely loved it so practical goes
with so many things so that is my outfit
of the night really hope you guys
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
seated and I'll see you very very soon
in the next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
