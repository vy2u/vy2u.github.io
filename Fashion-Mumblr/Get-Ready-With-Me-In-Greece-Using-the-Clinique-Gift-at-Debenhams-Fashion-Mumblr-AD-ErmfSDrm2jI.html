and quick makeup tutorial using this
exclusive gifts that from Clinique which
is available at Debenhams with two or
more purchases I'm starting off my
makeup routine with some moisturizer on
holiday hydration for the skin is
absolutely case I'm using the
dramatically different moisturizing
lotion plus this is a handy 30ml size so
really good for taking with you on your
travels next because the under eye area
needs hydrating too I'm using my all
about eyes sample then I'm applying a
little bit of foundation using my clinic
foundation brush I don't like to go
completely makeup free on beach it's
something quite lightweight ooh a little
bit of SPF definitely helps me to feel a
little bit more humid while on the beach
then to brighten the under eye area I'm
just using a little bit of lightening
creamy concealer and then to set it in
place I'm using some pressed powder and
my bronzer brush just to ensure that I
have a matte finish all day long next
I'm using another product from the
Clinique gift set is the limitation
palette featuring all of our shadow
uptown Downtown duo I'm starting off by
using the lighter shade just to give my
eyes a simple wash of color before
moving onto mascara the set also comes
as a mini high impact mascara in black
once again is small enough to fit in
your hand luggage I love that I don't
even need to curl my lashes just a few
strokes and I get big bold and beautiful
lashes
then to finish off I add a little bit of
color using some bronzer I use bronzer
not only to add one but also to almost
contour my face as well the finishing
touch is the next day and I'm using the
new Clinique upgrades from the set it's
the sheer lip color and primer in a
sprinkle pop because I don't want such
an intense color I'm actually just
patting someone with my finger instead
of applying it directly this gives a
much more natural finish so there's my
makeup look done really quick easy and
simple to do next and packing everything
away ready to head to the beach
of course my makeup kit comes with me
just in case I need to do any top ups on
the go
also my beach essentials include my
camera of course bikini sunglasses and
magazine
then it's outside to enjoy the sunshine
of course I'm applying a little bit of
SPF and then I sit back relax and read
for the afternoon
after a long day out in the Sun on the
boat and by the pool I decided to take
my makeup off to start again ready for
the evening I'm using the take the day
off makeup remover for lids lashes and
lips this once again is a really handy
50 mil bottle so even if you're
traveling with hand luggage only you can
still take it I apply this onto a cotton
pad and then smooth it over my face and
it gets sort of every single trace of
makeup ready to create a makeup look
suitable for an evening partying on the
beach I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I'll see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
