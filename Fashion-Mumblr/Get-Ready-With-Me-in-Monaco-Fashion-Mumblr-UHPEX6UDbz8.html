Monaco we've woken up to beautiful blue
skies and we are being such
stereotypical vloggers this morning the
girls have been preparing the most
Instagram and will breakfast set up
Huddle's or distances so we're now going
to all fight for the perfect shot and
you're ready to get the sharpest don't
Utah refer hi everyone we do agree our
fantasies our dresses I woke up like
roasting this one I think oh my goodness
so now we're going to bring the final
chair over we have the perfect another
graham chairs no tragic
okay so we are now at the marina and
we've distorted our yacht for the day
that's going to be taking us around the
bay we're going to be doing a little bit
of sightseeing but from the water which
is going to be absolutely wonderful I
switched into Miami try and get a little
bit of a term so sing across the weather
it stays beautiful plus Caroline and I
have shotgun the best seats in the house
down the track in geelong covered area
so it's going to be a wonderful morning
so few hours since I last picked up a
camera I have just got out of the most
amazing bath and that evolved into so
long because of all translations etc and
on that note Charlie just sent me some
photos and I think the house is nearly
done so he's been keeping an eye on the
filters and making sure they're doing
what you should be doing so all is on
track and see I have an W bar wash my
hair and I've got about 45 minutes now
to get ready until a meeting to dinner
so I thought the thing is I haven't
really done that much vlogging and I
will leave my camera on a tripod into
like a mini get ready with me you can
see how I'm doing my makeup for the
final evening here in Monaco I thought
I'd do it out on the balcony because
it's just so beautiful out here get some
better lighting and starts by paying
back my hair so I've got this handy
little travel kit from Lots cam they've
got this really good offer on at the
moment all about travel minis so I have
a little goodie bag full of amazing
miniature pieces I'm going to use this
one to start with it is there his one
sublime perfection cream basically it's
such and lovely base the makeup it
smells really really nice through fresh
and I feel like my skin is craving this
after a day in the Sun I've got this lip
balm in my handbag is the ESOP SPF 30
and it's so good for traveling with of
the SPF also I just really like to put
on some lip balm before doing my makeup
so that is all absorbs really fun I do
my little bit later by foundation I'm
going with my Old Faithful Rimmel match
perfection this is what I reach for when
I just want to have good skin and don't
really want to pass about with
experimenting or have to worry about my
face because I can always rely on it
okay so I recognize this turkey over the
top I actually have three makeup bags
with me this one has like my travel
miniatures for my essentials this one
has got the bulk of my makeup and then
this is the one that I keep in my
everyday come bag so in here this one is
from a brand called the daily edited and
I love it because personalized I'll
leave links everything's down below but
I'm going to use my Bourjois healthy mix
because this is an anti fatigue
concealers they're really good for those
pesky eyebags I'm going to blend it with
my very dirty Beauty Blender for brows
I'm going to use my Delilah brow line
this one always comes with me and I'm
traveling which is so tiny and basically
it's a perfect color for me this one is
the shade ash double-o one and then as
always finishing we're that the benefit
gimme brow which will just help to add a
bit of volume and also except mentally
now this you might recognize because I
use it so often it's my sealer eyes are
the window shadow palette I love it
because the traveling it's got such a
big lid and then all the best like
neutral ground shades ranging from that
sparkly light the dark so really
everything that I need if I'm packing in
a rush I know I can rely on this one so
I'm going to use it simply go to sparkly
night maybe starting with this one so
because it still is a little bit muggy
I'm going to set my face with my Bobbi
Brown powder this one again I have a
really handy tiny pot so it always stays
in my travel bag and just using a fan
brush so that doesn't cake up it has a
really light layer where I need it
so bronzer my trusty hourglass this is
actually all my favorite all-time
products but I just know I can rely on
so these the ones I packed with me this
particular trip and I did forget my big
bronzing brush I'm using a contour brush
but actually it's not the bad community
meals and more precisely where you apply
it
so now that I've done my liner next up
we're going to use my sumptuous extreme
mascara from Estee Lauder I use it on
the whole time while I was in the States
and it just gives you really lovely big
bold lashes no fuss just really nice big
fluttery lashes so perfect for evening
and now finally moving on to the lips
I'm going to use three different
products first of all is my favorite lip
liner this is the urban decay liar to
love the shade of this and it's so
smooth it doesn't like draggled a little
and it start by lining mix of the front
and now to add a slightly darker color
all over this is the new Burberry lip
contour in shave number one so this is
actually the lightness of the range but
it's still a fairly brownie pink I'm
going to start by filling all of my lips
in with this one so the result now is
the kind of brownie almost a perfect
pink lip so what I'm going to do to
finish is apply my current favorite this
is the Mac verticals lipstick and I know
I'm biased because I know flirt but I am
novice lipstick the color is gorgeous
and I feel like together this is a
really lovely combination and it's so
barmy as well
so even when you're look for a little
bit dry still super comfortable is that
not just most beautiful color you have
ever seen so so perfect finishing
touches I'm just going to use the Too
Faced sweet peach palette and this one
has got a lovely blush and highlight in
it you can use the same brush because I
definitely forgot to brighten it too
so starting off with blush just on
apples of the cheeks this one does have
some nice shimmer in it as well so if
you don't want to go for full on
highlight it still gives you a little
bit of a sheen and then a highlight just
on cheek bone to
so I just curled my hair with my GHD
Tottenham trailers and I'm going to
finish with a little bit of dry
hairspray to keep these cars and
painting that a little bit more volume
this is the orb a dry texturizing spray
and I think I covered in a birch box or
something our midline it's such a handy
size for travel other I think it's just
about run out so I'm gonna have to add
that to Charlotte and then finally I'm
going to use the show premiere finishing
spray and this will just act as a bit of
a hairspray keep those curls empty and
although the soft smell for me final
step I almost forgot I'm trying to
finish off my
Isildur bronze goddess this is the
shimmering body oil spray this is
actually last year's version but I just
got the new honors I'm trying to finish
this off basically makes your limbs
really sparkly or they're not so fast
it's really beautiful shine and it
smells so good bronze goddess is one of
our all-time favorite fragrances so it's
just a river two-in-one
Oh
incredible dinner at the Blue Bay and it
was another mission instead dinner so
actually every meal that we've had here
has been in mission style restaurants so
they've all been absolutely incredible
but this one I think the desserts just
trumps it all we had this incredible
everybody was given three different
desserts as part two of our desserts
that was not even like the whole thing
and it was also experimental we had like
fruit sushi
we had sesame flavored ice cream there
was like a pea and mint ice cream very
experimental the chef obviously had so
much fun designing that menu and and it
was absolutely scrumptious so we feel
very well-fed it's midnight three
minutes past midnight so once again
super late for granny over here so I'm
gonna say good night tomorrow flying to
Paris for a lovely couple of days there
so I'll be taking you guys along with me
and yeah it should be really good fun so
thanks for watching thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and I will see you tomorrow
good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
