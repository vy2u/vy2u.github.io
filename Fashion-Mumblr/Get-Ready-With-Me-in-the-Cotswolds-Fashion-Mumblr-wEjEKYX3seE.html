in a different location as you can see
I'm actually away in the Cotswolds for a
couple of nights with Charlie which is
having a nice little break
away from the city so I thought it'd be
a good opportunity to show you what kind
of bits and bobs I bring with me in my
travel makeup bag so I'm not an overseas
makeup bag just the kind of things I
take with me to do my makeup when I'm
not at home but soon the UK if that
makes sense so the makeup bag that I
have with me and by the way I didn't
plan on filming this videos so I
probably many have chosen more
photogenic things if I had but this is
very realistic which is wonderful the
makeup bag that I have with me and two
bonus don't you system most of the time
when I travel because it's clear so
grateful being able to see what's inside
it I didn't actually know where this one
is from doesn't have a brand on it oh it
does it's brand cool low low inside is
pretty much product so I know that my
skin loves so when I'm away obviously I
just want to know that my skin is gonna
react really well to the products and
they're going to work really well for me
I've also got a couple of extra bits and
bobs in there like some under eye masks
just in case of any late nights and also
an Estee Lauder's sheet mask sometimes
when we're away we like to have a bit of
a pamper and obviously a sheet mask it
doesn't create any mess so it's really
quick and easy to do I'm not gonna go
through every single item that's in my
makeup bag just here like this because I
didn't factor use most of it while doing
my makeup this morning so without
further ado I'm just going to whiz into
the bathroom and let you guys get ready
with me I didn't actually film my
skincare routine though however I will
let you know that first of all I used a
cleanser from Neal's your remedies and
this is from the collaboration with
deliciously Ella I bought this one with
me cuz I felt it was quite appropriate
or the Cotswolds it's their rose lime
and cucumber face wash and I just
absolutely love the way that it smells
it feels really natural and just good to
my skin so I use this one first before
going in with an essence from origins
I've only recently become obsessed with
essences and it's really enjoyable part
of my skincare routine which just leaves
my skin nice and hydrated this is the
origins original skin essence lotions
with dual ferment complex
it's not sure what that complex actually
does but either way my skin loves it
another really lovely natural products
that my skin adores and then because
we're going to be spending a lot of time
outside today of course I use an SPF and
I went for the origins mega define its
SPF 25 dr. Andrew Weil so that was the
final step it was skin care routine
before the makeup
expose your babe I'm just trying to
explain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
