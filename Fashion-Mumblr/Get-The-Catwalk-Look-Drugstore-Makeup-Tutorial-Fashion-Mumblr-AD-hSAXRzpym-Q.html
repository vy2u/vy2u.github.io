really well and have a fabulous weekend
as you can probably tell from my bare
face today's video is going to be a
makeup tutorial which I still haven't
done in quite some time and this one is
going to be a really really fun one as
you may know at last weekend's the past
few days has been a crazy one in London
it has been at London Fashion Week which
you might know if you've been keeping an
eye on my Instagram stories etc and I
also have a few vlogs from London
Fashion Week coming very soon but
basically I thought that seeing as this
year I was really lucky that I was able
to go backstage speak to a lot of the
makeup artists who are creating the
looks on model breaks the shows and also
go to a few of the shows myself I
thought I would try to take some of the
things I learned from the shows and
recreate the catwalk makeup looks using
drugstore products so that it's
incredibly affordable and hopefully
everyone will be able to recreate these
looks at home so I'm going to be using
beauty products from seventeen they are
one of my favorite drugstore DG bands of
all time incredibly affordable and
available from Boots
so I'm going to using that brand to
recreate some of the trends without
sausage backstage so one of the first
shows that I went backstage at was mark
frost this was at the Freemason pool I
will show you on screen now a little bit
of footage from backstage as you can see
it's always very manic but I did - the
sweets and makeup artists and they let
me know that one of the main trends that
they were recreating before the show was
a really beautiful fresh face and this
is quite unusual for autumn/winter shows
normally you find a really fresh and
dewy complexion coming through in the
spring shows but I'm definitely not
going to complain because a fresh and
dewy complexion is one of my absolute
favorite things to recreate I have
naturally quite glowing skin so yeah
this is one I really like to create
please recreate that look I'm going to
be using two products from seventeen the
first one is a little bit unusual but I
picked this up a tip from one of the
backstage makeup artists and I'm going
to be using a liquid bronzer this is the
17th skin Wow
hand liquid glow so you can use this as
a highlight you can dab it onto the
cheekbones to get a beautiful glow so
what I'm actually going to do is mix it
in with my
we cruise to create a really lovely warm
glow all over the base I'm going to mix
it with my 17 blemish BB bomb this is
amazing because it's kind of like a skin
care and beauty products all-in-one it
means I don't need to worry too much
about how I prepare the skin I put on a
moisturizer quite some time ago and but
it also gives beautiful coverage as well
this one is SPF 25 and it also got some
skin care ingredients which helps
minimize pores and help Frant blemishes
I'm suffering from blemishes around my
jawline at the moment not short article
Merman allure a stress from Fashion Week
but I'm very thankful for the blemish
fighting ingredients within this so I've
pumped some of the BB cream onto my hand
and I'm just going to add a little bit
of the liquid bronzer okay so I've got
maybe two parts BB cream to every one
part of bronzer and I'm just going to
use my finger to mix the two together
and I'm going to apply that directly
onto the skin at the bronzer has given a
slightly lighter texture so I may go in
afterwards with a little bit more of the
BB cream because as I said I do have a
few blemishes that I want to make sure I
hit them an above that in actually no
timer here at first ever since I had my
hair bleach it's just too easy yet
makeup in my hair so there we go and
then I'm just using circular motions and
immediately you can see the effect of
adding the liquid hands into my BB cream
has given such a beautiful glow to this
base so we're really being able to
recreate that beautiful glow that models
have at an incredibly affordable price
it's almost given my cheek a highlight
without even using a highlighter so
that's really really lovely I like to
take it over my iPhone as well
especially seeing as we do have the
shimmer in there it really helps to just
lift the eyebrow area as well I am so so
happy with how this base looks this is
such a lovely base for springtime even
though it's from the autumn winter 17
catwalk shows I think that a really
glowing and perfected skin is on
all year round for the specials you come
into spring so I was also lucky enough
to go backstage at the Amelia Wixted
show the models also had beautiful
glowing skin and they were quite precise
with where they apply the bronzer so
where normally I would take a big brush
like this one I've learned in my bronzer
and really I go quite crazy I'm actually
going to be a lot more precise and use
the smaller brush into the contouring
brush and I'm going to be using the 17th
instant while and light bronze so this
one is not going to be making me orange
or making me too dark but it's going to
be a lot more subtle like we saw
backstage this year instead of sweep
this soft matte pressed powder of the
cheekbones for a natural bronze glow and
a natural glow is exactly what we want
so I'm going to get quite a lot on my
brush cut off the excess and once again
I'm going to start with the cheekbones
and which children what it was Julien
Macdonald at the cheekbones on those
girls was amazing and actually a lot of
the outfits had the girls hours out and
you could definitely use a brush like
this to just add a little bit of shading
it to any areas of support where you
want to add a little bit more tone so
this is a matte bronzer so I'm
definitely not wanting to apply it over
the areas that I've already got a lovely
bit of shimmer so really just focusing
it on the cheekbones and then just
slightly around the hairline to make it
look at that I've got a natural tan
I'm just being so so so light with it I
really do not want to add too much
products to my skin it's a really nice
patting motions just to get it exactly
where I want it the color of this one I
also really love using as an eyeshadow I
find if you're blond and in particular
than this warm tone is really flattering
i shadow shade especially for the crease
area I'll show you how I do that a
little bit later because this is a matte
color you can also use it for contouring
so to that I make sure I've got teeny
bit on my brush pop it down the side of
my nose underneath and then and my jaw
line to help clean the place up a little
bit slimmer right next time I'm going to
look at the brows for the first time in
a long time I didn't really notice too
much emphasis on the brows instead of
being big and bold and fleshy this year
they were more subtle they were acting
beautiful and very polished and
perfected but a little bit more pared
back than usual so I'm going to be using
these seventeen brow kit that has pretty
much everything you need for all brow
stylist a I'm going to use it for
creating a more natural looking brow so
in the seventeen rao's that brow kit
you've got everything you need for this
brow look including a big mirror in the
lid in case you want to do your brows on
the go or pack it in your sleepover bag
but you've also got a couple of powders
this one is the powder I'm going to use
to fill in any gaps in my brows and then
this is a lighter powder for again
highlighting underneath the brow bone to
really lift them and give them a fresh
look and you've also got a gel here
which is really good for setting the
brows in place as well as that you've
got the little brush and a pencil I
really love using a pencil especially a
sharp one like this for creating the
brow hair like strokes on the eyebrows
to really keep the brows looking as
natural as possible using the brush in
the kit and start off with its really
beautiful almost gray brown shade not
going too much on the brush and then any
areas of my brows which are a little bit
sparse which for me is quite a large
brow I'm going to very lightly use hair
light strokes to fill in any gaps
so as you can see I've really defines
the eyebrow shape and added in more
color fill those gaps using the shadows
next I'm going to take this lighter
shade and I'm going to use in from brush
I'm going to use one of my eye shadow
brushes to really lightly pick up some
color and then post that just underneath
the arch to the tail of the brow bone
because it's a little bit of shimmer on
it it really helps you highlight the
area and give you a more than wide-eyed
look and also just again emphasize that
fresh glowing skin that we've seen
backstage at Fashion Week I'm actually
loving this color so much that I'm going
to take a little bit more on my brush
and just put a little bit down the
center of my nose this again is just
gonna emphasize the glowing skin and
also on the cheekbone
it's got a love of multi-use products
I'm really really pleased with that in
fact that is as good as some of my
really high-end highlights
I'm very impressed okay so what you Kris
do next is use this cream color and to
reset the brows in place I'm actually
not going to do that this time because
it will add a little bit more darkness
to the color and as I said with my hair
Complete Streets early I don't want to
have super super dark brows but I am
just going to use a little pencil this
is just the 17 for our pencil that came
in a kit to really emphasize when my
brows have no hair whatsoever at the
moment I've used the powder to fill in
the shape but I'm going to create hair
like strokes using the pencil I find
this particularly good under tail of the
brow and if you've not had your brows
done in a few weeks then if it's really
good at is making the brow shape seem
really perfected okay I'm really happy
with brows going to populate a kit and
next I know can move on to eyeshadow so
eyeshadow once again wasn't really a
focus at Fashion Week this year so I'm
going to use some really lovely neutral
colors including the bronzer this is
coming back and here I've got 17 i I
shadow in the shade ivory I love that
they come in a little singles especially
for the shades you use every day I often
run out of these kind of shades in my
big palettes so really handy you can
pick them up on their own I've got ivory
and also funfair which are both really
beautiful forges and everyday makeup
look or no makeup makeup look or in this
case is creating a really beautiful
natural eye complement glowing skin so I
start by taking the ivory shadow this
white one or just off-white and using
the same brushes before it's not a
matter I'm going to put this all over
the lid
so because this acts as a really nice
space for the rest of you are I set it
up
I'm just really illuminates the whole
eye area I'm taking it right into the
corners close to my nose and then almost
up to the brow as well well ivory is a
matte shadow from Claire has got some
shimmer in it and I personally love
shimmery eyeshadows but it's not going
to make me look sparkly in any way which
is definitely not what they were going
for backstage at Fashion Week so what
I'm going to do is really lightly brush
my makeup brush over this because
beautiful pink tint to it as well so
this is going to be gorgeous for spring
the makeup look and what I'm going to do
is just sweep this over the eyelid not
going any higher than the crease oh my
goodness
I look how much this is such a gorgeous
shade it's like me we love to have a
little bit of pink in your look then
you're going to love that reminds me of
the shade that I'm loving in the Too
Faced reached peak week to teach palette
I'm actually nice a lot more wearable so
I'm pressing this really carefully just
over the lid and then finishing it off
maybe a third before my nose so I don't
wanna get it too close to my nose so you
can still see a little bit of white in
the corner of the eye and then finally
because we're not going to be using as
much eyeliner or we still want our eyes
to be quite defined I'm going to be
going in with the bronzer the same brush
again that you really just don't need to
worry about having loads of eye makeup
brushes I'm going to take a little bit
of bronzer and apply this into the
crease to give the eyes a little bit
more definition in the Julien Macdonald
show particularly the eye crease was
really swept out but I'm going to keep
this look a little bit more natural and
wearable just by bringing it to the
corner of the eye
let's do this keep your eyes open
because you want to make sure you're
really following the crease of your eye
and then just sweep it in a semi-circle
movement until you get to the corner of
the eye okay I am really really happy
with how the eye shadow has turned out
it's still very natural but it
definitely got that fresh spring light
glow that we spotted backstage of
Fashion Week what I would normally do
next is apply some eyeliner this is a
seventeen and lacquer liner wet look
finish and this because if the wet look
probably would go really well with this
type of look with a glowing face but
actually backstage I didn't see that
much eyeliners and makeup artists were
losing it to the side and going in
straight mascara so the sake of this
makeup look so that's what I'm going to
do I'm going to use my favorite
drugstore mascara this is a seventeen
multiply 80 lashes mascara you've heard
me talking about this so many times
before you know how much enough this
really defines and separates the lashes
so I'm not even gonna bother curling the
lashes this time the brush kind of does
that for me it's amazing stiff bristle
which really allows you to wiggle
between the lashes a lot of the models
weren't even wearing mascara and that I
can't leave the house without it so I'm
just going to apply a really light coat
wiggling between the lashes just making
sure all the lashes are lightly coated
I'm also going to avoid my lower lash
line because I really want to keep the
eyes looking as open and as fresh as
possible
alright fluttery light lashes complete
so I'm really happy with how that turned
out my eyes look fresh and bright which
is exactly what we want going into
spring
next is the lips and I'm sure you will
be dying to know what they were doing
backstage with the lips this year and
there was again nothing dramatic it's
very pared back this year but what I did
notice on a lot of models will just a
hint of color the lips look really
nourish but they just had a subtle hint
of lots of pinks lots of news so that
I'm going to first of all apply a little
bit more balance my lips to make sure
and 19
and then I'm going to use a lip brush to
just pat on a little bit of lip color so
first of all let's make sure the lips
are nice and soft with some bonds and
then at the shades that personally I
find the most wearable I spotted
backstage our immune stand pinks and I
was very pleased to see those shades
backstage because of course they are my
favorite here I've got the scape out
from 17 in shade st. me and I've also
got to shade the coral of the story how
cute I think the thing is I've gone so
nude on the eyes I'm going to use the
coral shade but as I said it's really
not an all-over color instead it really
is as though the lips have been pinched
and the color looks really natural and
fresh so we're going to do is take a lip
liner brush and it's sort of applying
directly I'm going to choose the amount
that I take on the brush and then Pat it
onto the lip
and we are done so this is the finished
look I really hope you guys liked it I
was so so pleased when I was watching
the makeup artists doing their magic
backstage because there's nothing worse
than an unachievable makeup look but
this season for autumn i-17 it is going
to be about that glowing base and just
really subtle but still polished and
perfected on the eyes and lips which i
think is super wearable and easy to
achieve so hopefully are giving you some
food for thought on how you can create a
catwalk look at home using these
incredible affordable products every
