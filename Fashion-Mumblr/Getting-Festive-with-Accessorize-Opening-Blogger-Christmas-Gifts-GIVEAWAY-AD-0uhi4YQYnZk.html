much for joining me for today's video
which is a very very very exciting one
because it is my first festive Christmas
video for the 2016 Christmas season so
as you can imagine I'm very very excited
to be filming this this video is an
extra fun one because it is in
collaboration with accessorized food
this year wants us to gift share repeat
so not only am I going to be opening up
my own prezi's from accessorized which
have been kindly given to me by Hannah
from fabulous Hannah but I'm also going
to be giving you a sneak peek as to what
I have chosen for my blogger friend
Meg's from wonderful you also from
accessorized so without further ado
let's have a little look what is inside
this overflowing and bulging bag that
Hannah has kindly put together for me oh
gosh I'm so excited to see what is in
here I can see already pink and fluffy
these are two of my favorite things so
this first piece is a scarf from
accessorized although I don't know
whether you passed by this as a scarf or
a stole because if this almost u-shaped
so it works really nicely as a collar if
you've got a lovely long coat like a
wool coat and it is so warm and snuggly
this is definitely the kind of thing
that just really elevates a load of
winter coats and winter outfits adds
warmth and definitely as a fashionable
touch as well plus these colors are so
me very autumnal but still pink which I
just absolutely love so really good
first choice Thank You Hannah
I feel like I'm just gonna leave this on
because a little bit chilly in this room
and it's so cozy the next thing looks
like a necklace don't know open up and
see although I think it's from the
zodiac collection this is so pretty oh
that's so pretty
so it is a delicate gold chain and then
you've got this little flower emblem on
the end I feel like this is almost like
an Indian chakra sign I think but I
might be wrong but it's a very delicate
Gold flower with little diamonds inside
it's so simple so feminine and this gold
chain is just really delicate too so I
feel like I want to put this on as well
that's the thing when I get
so I just want to wear them all
immediately put them on straight away
this is so beautiful so me as well rose
gold very very me and pop this on
because it's too beautiful not too can
you imagine if the other gifts were like
probably hat scarf gloves I'd end up
looking like do you know that chocolate
game when you have to dress up in the
Hat the scarf or gloves or coat and then
you can eat the chocolate did anyone
else used to play that yeah I kind of
feel like we're playing that right now
anyway let's see what's next
I'm loving these gifts so far ooh la la
oh my gosh this is rather large filling
at most the bag and it looks like a
handbag slash camera bag I feel like
this is probably officially a handbag
but for me I just saw this shape and I
was like oh my gosh my camera equipment
would go really well in this bag so I'm
really gonna end up using this as a
camera bag or even like a vanity case
like it's a really good shape for
keeping a makeup in things like that in
this classic leopard print style which I
just adore these gifts are so so so
fabulous accessorize for me is one of
those places where you can just go in
and it's like a wonderland full of
Christmas gifts I always walk out there
with so many people ticked off my
Christmas list and I'm not surprised
that I love everything so far this bag
is actually really spacious it's got
these two big compartments and then this
slit pocket along the front as well and
a very practical over shoulder straps I
think I probably start to use this as a
camera bag I can put like memory cards
in here plenty of room for my lenses so
practical and so useful and I never ever
print so ticks all the boxes the next
thing is pink which is just amazing oh
these are accessorized buff roses I
wonder how bath roses work don't if
they're like bath bombs drop into the
bath and a warm running water until
dissolved before enjoying a relaxing spa
bath so I guess things not only do they
look beautiful and you can kind of
decorate the bathroom with them but they
also dissolve to make your bath really
warming and smelling nice all those good
things perfect time of year to receive
something like this because everybody
loves to take long room baths in the
winter season I know I do
so I've definitely Chinese out tonight
amazing next is so
very elegant and feminine this is a
beautiful clutch bag also from
accessorized it's a beautiful lace
material so really really plastic I feel
like this is a kind of thing for
Christmas parties if you've got any
dresses that just really you need to
carry a few things with you but you
don't want to take a massive handbag
this is just such a classic piece so
feminine so ladylike love it this is so
funny oh my gosh the next thing in my
gift bag I have been totally spoiled is
a pair of ear muffs and I have wanted oh
my gosh I can't hear you I have been
looking for a pair of earmuffs for so
long I went on a walk yesterday and it
just really made me realize that my ears
get very cold when I'm out walking but
sometimes you don't want to wear a hat
because it might flatten your hair but
this is so perfect these are going to
get so much use I can guarantee you're
going to be seeing these and a lot of
logs coming up they just look so cute
they're kind of noise cancelling as well
so if Charlie's just yakking away I can
just chew him out by putting these on
and finally to complete my winter outfit
of the day hannah has chosen these
beautiful classic black gloves and I
feel like black gloves are such a winter
essential and so many times I wish I was
carrying glass with me but I just keep
forgetting to put them in my handbag so
these are gonna go straight to my
handbag because they're gonna come in
very handy for dog walks and shopping
trips those times when you're just out
and about and you don't want to get
nippy hands so another amazing gift from
Hannah so thank you so so so much Hannah
I absolutely love a haul of my gifts you
know me very well everything is just so
up my street so perfect but of course as
I mentioned this is not all about
receiving for me
the best part of Christmas is gift
giving so now I'm going to share with
you the few pieces that I picked up for
Meg from wonderful you let me show you
what I've chosen for accessorize to give
to her as part of the gift share repeat
if like me you also love giving as much
as you love receiving at Christmas then
you're going to want to stick around for
the end of this video because I actually
have a really exciting giveaway where
you can win something to give to one of
your friends this Christmas so if you
want to give someone a gift they'll
absolutely love then hang
for the end of this video and I'll let
you know how you can win I'm going to
take this off now cuz I'm getting a
little bit warm and not sure if you can
take me seriously wearing a fur stole
indoors okay so I might have shot myself
in the foot when it comes to rapping
because the first thing that I've chosen
for Meg
it's pretty big it is this blue backpack
and I know Meg of course is a blogger
and youtuber and we are always carrying
so much stuff our cameras are like maybe
change your clothes if you're doing
outfit shoes so backpacks come in really
really handy and Meg loves kind of
unusual colors and she doesn't really go
with like run-of-the-mill type classic
items I thought this was a really lovely
just a very unusual color I'd always
call it like a periwinkle but a really
lovely classic design and it's got this
gold lock feature which is really
beautiful and then a pocket on the front
and this huge compartment in the middle
so I can imagine Meg just filling this
with overnight things maybe or her bits
and bobs for a full day out in London
because Matt doesn't live in London so
it's great for her to have something to
keep all her bits in while she's
spending the day in town next I also
picked her up a scarf great minds think
alike and I feel like everybody needs a
nice scarf in the winter time we've also
gone for same colors similar kind of
shades to the one that Hanna chose for
me this one has multicolored bulbs of
fur and different colored fur bits in it
and which mix hair is always changing
color one day it's like a beautiful dark
Auburn and one day it's like bright
orange she just looks fabulous no matter
what hair color she has so I felt like
this would go with an array of different
hair colors and it's got this beautiful
burgundy color in there which I know Meg
absolutely loves in a similar color
which I hope she might wear with the
scarf I picked up these gloves like the
ones Hannah got for me they also plain
on the outside like this leather
material and then you fold them over and
they have this faux fur trim absolutely
beautiful just such a classic design
hopefully these little stock Meg from
getting chilly hands in the winter and
to stop her from getting chilly feet and
I know socks sometimes are a bit of a
present you're like
you're gonna get someone socks but I
mean when they're this cute you can't
really say no so I picked up two pairs
of socks to give to make for Christmas
these ones are gray with a little bit of
frill on the top I just think they're
really cute and cozy and Meg often wears
clots with boots and then she has her
top her socks sticking out the tops I
thought these would be a really lovely
detail for that kind of styling and then
for when she's chilling at home with her
hot chocolate over coffee she can wear
these super snuggly knitted white socks
and these have got little pom-poms
hanging from them I'm not going to take
them out of the plastic because then it
would look a little bit weird need to
open her gifts but yeah these like a
chunky cable knit sock you can see I
will leave links to all of these on the
accessorize website down below so you
can have a look if you feel inspired to
treat any of your friends these pieces
as well yeah I just think she'll be so
snuggly and warm in these ones because
it is accessorized I had to pick up a
necklace for Meg and I chose this
beautiful hanging pendant with a rose
gold circle and marble disk inside I
thought it was a little bit unusual but
still just quite a classic piece and I
felt that this would look really good
perhaps worn with a high-neck jumper or
a polo neck and every blogger loves rose
gold and marble so I felt that this just
ticked so many boxes and I can
definitely envisage Meg loving this one
so hopefully she does and then the final
gift once again really big for wrapping
so if any of you guys have got wrapping
tips and let me know I picked her up
another bag because a girl can never
have too many handbags right so this one
is just absolutely beautiful is in this
gold material with once again a really
beautiful gold clasp inside it's so good
for anyone that loves bag organizations
there are so many little pockets you've
got this front one two main compartments
and then also a zippy section as well as
a zippy pocket in the back so so good
for keeping a little bits and bobs
organized I just love the color
I know Megan loves metallics so I really
thought she would love this bag so that
is my final gift for Meg I really really
hope she loves them so you guys have
seen the pieces that I have been treated
to by fabulous Hannah I
so you love them I cannot wait to wear
so many of these especially the earmuffs
like these are the most excited about
I'm so so grateful it's almost as though
she read my mind and you guys have also
seen that the pieces that I have gifted
to Meg from wonderful you it's all about
giving as well as receiving at
Christmastime so on that note I'd like
