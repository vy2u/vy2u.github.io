unusual vlog from me you will probably
know what's going on in the slog thanks
to the title so yes today is a day I'm
getting my brows done I'm very very
excited a little bit nervous I'm more
nervous about the treatment itself and
how it's going to look like afterwards
so yeah I getting my brows done is some
things that I've thought about quite a
long time in fact just over a year ago
one of my best friends got hers done and
they looked absolutely incredible and
they still look incredible so has been
on my mind for a while and then an
opportunity came up recently for me to
actually review some wares I thought I
couldn't say no so today's a day I'm
going to a lady called Sean dalla who
looks fabulous I've read so many reviews
and they look really really natural
which is definitely the look I'm going
for as you guys know I'm definitely not
like a full face of makeup big plastered
on brows type of girl so for me the main
thing is that they're going to look
really really natural so fingers crossed
that's what's going to happen though I
start the vlog now before I go in just
so you can see my brows in a natural
state I've taken a few Clips close-ups
witch islands and now so you know a
really good look at them basically
they're just quite gapi here and then
they go just they're just rubbish shape
and ever since I plucked them too much
when I was little if you're young
watching this do not touch your brows
because that's my biggest regret ever
and but yeah I just not really been
happy with them I'm not happy leaving
the house without brow makeup on so this
kind of treatment seemed like a really
good alternative for me you can put a
towel for my voice I don't sound normal
I sound really nervous
that's because I just need to need to
pluck up the courage to leave and go and
get it done so before I start nervous
rambling any longer let's just go and do
this
okay almost at the clinic now on Harley
Street the nerves are really starting to
sink in and what real nervous tom eat is
this my first of a tattoo I never
thought I would get a tattoo anywhere
let alone on my eyebrows but I'm surely
worth it so just got here pretty much
you inside
okay so I'm in the room with the lovely
Shawn and you can see my brows looking
very scary at the moment that's I've got
an empty numbing cream on the brows so
hopefully it'll mean I won't feel too
much of what's going on we're about to
draw in my brows with some pencils so we
can get a good idea of the shape it
going to be this is very important step
because how we draw them in now is how
it's going to look so let's go
so this is the shape that we've drawn in
I say we shall open it I had nothing to
do with it they look really beautiful
natural we've gone for really nice we
again gone for a really nice rounded
shape on the edge it's basically not too
dissimilar to my natural brow shape just
a lot better so now Sean's going to use
this as a template I'm going to get
stopped in excited and nervous
so not only are we vlogging this
treatment but also my that's going on
over there
this is 360 fibro micro bleeding
and we're done guys what do you think
money well I guess if people have a less
brow hair than me would it take quite a
bit longer I think it would be probably
bit quick I'm really has less hair to
move up move out of the way and you're
not really following any strokes words
because you have hair following yeah the
direction if you will have already
they're just kind of working out where
to go with
generally within the park you know it's
amazing honestly I felt like 10 15
minutes are you ready for this the big
reveal dun dun
so my brows are all done that great of a
grand total of like 15-20 minutes I
wouldn't even say that 20 minutes with
you
not that long how far do they look I
will do lot some place steps and I get
home but for now thank you to this
lovely lady for giving me the most
natural looking brows in the world I'm
just excited by them don't have to use
all our pencil eyeliner pencil eyebrow
pencil just left the clinic feeling very
happy with my new brows I can't wait to
show you and close it when I get home so
right now there is kind of like a numb
tingling I wouldn't describe it as a
pain I'd probably describe it as you
know when you get your bikini wax and
it's just like a little bit
uncomfortable that's probably why I
would say it feels like and Shawn has
given me all the aftercare information
which is basically just putting coconut
oil on in the mornings and in the
evenings
and then in about five to seven days it
should be pretty much normal I've got to
go back in four weeks yet them re
tattooed I stayed her too but it's more
subtly micro bleeding so she used like a
little blade tiny tiny blade to scratch
it in and that's pretty much the only
sensation it was like a scratching it's
really not that painful but as I am New
York's the street I think I'm going to
take the opportunity to take my mind off
things and do a little bit of shopping
also this cool breeze right now is very
very nice and refreshing on my brows
they're like I can't really get home and
put most cubes on them but this breeze
very nice also if I try and do any
facial expressions like that can confuse
your furrowed brow and it hurts teeny
teeny tiny bit so I'm going to be Botox
face for the rest of the day just
morning so I decided to get the bus home
because I didn't like the idea or
pollution from the tubes going into my
eyebrows probably been about
picked up a few bits from a genetic own
I'll show you those in another video but
sprout wise pretty much can't feel
anything rule again if I'm in time
I can
but I think once home do some work
I pretty much just get about them so
I'll see you at home
okay so I've just got home and Charlie
hasn't actually noticed which is amazing
because he is a very noticing kind of
person if I get my hair colored or
anything like that
and he notices so that kind of goes to
show how naturally look okay so the cat
is out the bag I told Charlie he was
very surprised but he said that they
look very natural which is wonderful so
now I can talk loudly about it I've come
into my bedroom now the bed is being
made don't judge me I do make my bed
every day and anyway so yeah I'm home
now to be honest I don't really feel
anything they just feel like if I follow
my brow like if I do a scrunch up
expression then it would probably hurt a
little bit but I can I don't want to
raise my eyebrows just in case that
hurts but yeah they don't hurt just
standing here normally I can feel
something like it doesn't feel
completely normal but it definitely
doesn't hurt the whole process I didn't
really talk about that earlier but um
the whole process the actual tattooing
although it's not tattooing it's micro
bleeding so basically she had a little
pot of dyes which she mixed up to make
my perfect colour which will start to
come through in a couple of days I would
see this a little bit dark but my actual
colour which is a little bit more
natural-looking will come through in a
couple of days so she used a tiny tiny
little blade about three millimeters
long and so thin to kind of scratch the
eyebrow area and she would dip it in the
dye before doing little scratches so the
scratches themselves the first couple I
couldn't really feel at all it was
literally like someone had taken a sharp
pencil and just was like flicking it on
my skin so really didn't hurt or
anything like that at all and but then
when she did the longer strokes so few
of the brow hairs are a little bit
longer that was a little bit more
uncomfortable I'm not going to say paint
books it really wasn't painful but it
was more uncomfortable and I was kind of
like squeezing my fingers in to
concentrate on that rather than my
actual browser sensation um but yeah the
whole thing just was
I'd say on a pain scale if like bikini
wax is a three out of ten and I don't
know a papercut is one out of 10 I'd say
it was a four out of ten so like a
little bit more pain for the Lamborghini
wax it really not that painful at all
and she said it'd be more uncomfortable
this afternoon and it's really not that
uncomfortable although apparently
everybody reacts differently to the
level of sensation on the eyebrows so
the process took less than half an hour
I was in the whole clinic for maybe an
hour and a half I went in at two o'clock
and I was out 24 so really didn't take
too long at all the longest part was
when Shawn was like plucking my eyebrows
to make sure there were no stray hairs
and drawing in the shape because
obviously the shape has to be absolutely
perfect so if i zoom in now hope-filled
focus and then really not very
flattering angle I'm not sure there's
even a flattering way to do this
standing in the daylight and there we go
it's focused so you can see the area is
still fairly red god this is such an
unflattering angle I look like an alien
but you can see how every single line
just looks as thin as actual brow hair
which is just incredible and and she's
even curved the line so the line doesn't
just go straight so I look really
unnatural they're very naturally shaped
which is just wonderful so Shawn's had
like over seven years experience she's
done thousands of brows and I think it
really really shows so I think that's
all I have to tell you today when I go
to bed I'm going to put a bit of coconut
oil on them as you recommended no water
for seven days which means blow dries
and very careful baths I probably won't
have any showers I'll probably just have
a few bars I won't go to the gym because
you know just means extra extra hair
watching this I'm going to give myself a
few a few days off and but yeah I will
pick this vlog up again on Thursday
morning to let you know how it's going
and they will probably be a lot more
natural a little bit softer color and
I'll be able to have a bit more make
Punk's I know I look a little bit scary
right now so I'll see you guys on
Thursday morning for an update i
close-up of how my brows look today
which is Wednesday two days after I had
them done hi guys so it's Wednesday
morning now I thought I was going to be
talking to you on Thursday because I
thought it was Tuesday so I got a little
bit confused and but yeah it's Wednesday
so two days after I went to visit Shawn
at the clinic and I thought I'd give you
a 2-day update so color wise as you can
see still very dark I'm hoping they are
going to lighten just a little bit
because I feel like they're not quite
the right color for my face and but
Shawn did say that within a couple of
weeks they would definitely lighten up
and look a lot more natural so that's
wonderful I have found that I've been
wearing slightly darker eye makeup I've
been putting a lot more eyeshadow on
just to almost like balance that out so
I don't feel like they look so out of
place on my face when I have a decent
amount of eye makeup on but when I wake
up in the mornings I look a tad scary
like a baby from The Simpsons with the
mono brow but with perfect shade for
hours if that makes sense the past
couple of days have been absolutely fine
no pain or discomfort the only thing to
note is that it's actually really hard
to go throughout your day without
pulling facial expressions I mean I can
raise my eyebrows and throw my brows
that's my mum cutie and yeah it's really
strange not being able to have full use
of your facial expressions I know that
this will come back but now because when
I move my brows they're just a teeny bit
sensitive
I've almost trained my face not to brow
furrow or you know raise any eyebrows or
anything like that so that's one thing I
wasn't expecting that has been quite
interesting we're watching a funny film
last night I couldn't I couldn't express
laughter or anger in the way that I
normally would but um yeah that's just
one unexpected side effect I've been
using the coconut oil um on the first
day I used it twice a day but today I
didn't feel the need to use it or last
night I didn't feel the need to use it
because my brows felt perfectly
moisturized and I didn't want to put any
extra oil on but I did put some one this
morning just because they felt a bit dry
now they feel totally comfortable and if
you look up close they are a little bit
shiny from where I've put the oil on um
but not shiny in like a really bad way
so I'm more than happy to leave the
house with this makeup on and I feel
like the brows look
just fantastic even looking in the
viewfinder right now I can't believe
that these are my actual brows the shape
I just absolutely love so please I got
it done the slight discomfort from a
couple of days ago just doesn't even
seem like anything anymore I'm just I'm
just so happy I did it I can't wait for
the color to settle in a little bit more
but yeah really really really happy with
the brows as I mentioned on Monday I do
have to go back in four weeks to get
them re tattooed so Sean will go over
the same area to really make sure that
color lasts for the full year or longer
hopefully so I think I will actually
snapchat that experience I'll probably
do a vlog update just as part of another
vlog but if you want to see me getting
my brows tattooed for the second time
the top up then make sure you're
following me on snapchat leave my
snapchat information here and I will
live snap from Sean's clinic if she lets
to me I'm sure she will she's so lovely
so yeah that's exciting
um don't you have anything else to say
to be honest if you've got any questions
about anything and leave it in the
comments I always try my absolute
hardest to reply to every single comment
I'll leave Sean's details down below
from my experience so far highly
recommend Sean so fantastic such a
lovely girl as well I really really love
her um and yeah I think that's what I've
got to say keep an eye on snapchat for
the tattoo top-up so thanks so much for
