vlog I thought I'd pick up the camera
and film what I'm getting up to this
week so I've got quite a few fun things
going on and to get myself more into the
vlogging swing of things because I might
vlog my trips to South Africa next week
so I thought I'd try and get myself back
into the swing of it um
it's Monday morning I've just got back
home after a really lovely breakfast at
this place called body ISM in Westbourne
Grove I went with a friend that I used
to work at Malibu it was really nice to
catch up and have a lovely healthy
breakfast I had an acai berry Bowl or do
you say acai I don't know calm pronounce
healthy things um and then yogurt and
granola and a smoothie I had like three
course breakfast so feeling very full
and then we had a little wind around the
shops um I just got back home and opened
up a little bit of mail got loads of
really beautiful spring/summer launches
so hopefully by the time this vlog goes
up you might have already seen on my
spring favourite launches video if I
have put it up then I'll link it down
below because there are so many amazing
amazing things I also ordered a few
Beauty bits and bobs from ASOS including
the LMS Tan accelerator so I'm quite
intrigued to see if this works
apparently increases your melanin and
helps you tan faster when you're on
holiday so I'm willing to give that a go
where else should I pick up I also got
the new NARS Velvet Matte skin tint is
SPF 30 so again I thought this would be
a good one for a day I've read quite a
lot of reviews on this I'm really
excited to give that try and might even
take this makeup off and give it a whirl
later also from a sauce I got a NARS
pure matte lipstick I actually played
around with these in space and Kay the
other day and fell in love with this
color it's number and it's a name it's
name is Tonkin and I thought was really
beautiful color so let me show you it's
this gorgeous kind of pinky Brown which
you guys know I absolutely love in fact
let's give it a first impressions
it's actually a little bit Pinker than I
thought it was going to be a little bit
more kind of rose-colored that's good
lighting but it's really really
beautiful and I think it's SPF 15 so
again another good one for holidays also
let me quickly show you what I got from
EMU these guys absolutely spoilt me look
at all these lovely shoes so I'm going
to quickly show you a few pairs of boots
that um you kindly sent me so here we go
I think my fatal laps are down here we
go so I think my favorites I'm torn
between these two pairs of boots so
we've got these lovely sheepskin ones
which are just absolutely gorgeous I'm
wondering if they're going to be too hot
for South Africa though although the
sheepskin or the furry bit doesn't
actually go too far down inside but
these ones are so gorgeous I tried them
on with these trousers earlier and they
looked absolutely beautiful so I love
those and it's nice to have something
non trainers for casual you know when
I've got meetings
these ones are incredibly practical
flip-flops I just think these are going
to be such saviors for like dashing to
the pool or on the beach things like
that and then these are a slightly
smarter pair of sandals and beautiful
kind of metallic almost rose gold there
so need to give all of those try as I
said already tried these and absolutely
love them yes so I was meant to be in
town all day today because I was
supposed to be going to the house of LMS
for a lovely little spa session but
annoyingly they double-booked so I'm
going to have to look at my diary and
try and go I think Wednesday's the only
other day I could go before South Africa
so I'm going to use this time to really
crack on with emails or show you're so
bored of me saying that absolutely my
life emails photo editing putting some
blog post together because I really
don't want to have to do too many blog
posts while I'm in South Africa and
and I also ordered new camera last night
so hopefully you guys are going to see a
nice increase in the quality of my
pictures and fingers crossed that arrive
before we go to South Africa so I'm
going to have a little tidy up in here
now and get on with some emails and I
will see you in a little bit okay it is
a few hours later now it's pretty much
getting dark outside I've put my
dressing gown on some to comfy
been doing emails and post editing and
video editing to the past three hours
my spring morning routine video is
taking so much longer to edit than I
planned for hopefully you guys have seen
it by now
I think I'm uploading it on some day so
I probably would have seen it while I've
been doing that Charlie has been making
some dinner where we were cooking
darling chicken our brown rice quinoa
veg nothing too excited
Charlie's making me a very healthy
dinner I would probably have mac and
cheese if it wasn't for him so jolly
good also I had a nightmare editing this
because I got about three minutes into
the actual video and then my laptop said
the memory was full and it shut down I
had to start all over again so if you
guys have watched this video then please
think about the pain that I went through
our front arab editing good morning it
is Tuesday morning ridiculously early
I'm about to go out and for an 8 o'clock
workout at Equinox and it's with this
works so hence why I've got a little bit
Mekong it's going to be other bloggers
and journalists there so I don't want to
turn up looking completely makeup free
got my sweaty Betty each of them things
on and yeah just heading out now gonna
get the tube to Kensington I think it is
so hopefully I won't take me too long
need to be there in about 55 minutes and
then I've got a really fun day planned
I've got a few meetings and I've got
like a skin care consultation with la
Prairie and Selfridges and I've also got
a breakfast straight after the workout
with Barry M so lots of things to do
don't want to be late so let's get going
and I will see you later
always so gorgeous
you
you
okay I just had to stop on the side of
the street anyone just happened
basically I just gotta close this
blogging and bird decided to crap all
over my camera at my hand but luckily I
went into the very em event and because
I know it's lucky its lucky
so yes turned out it was lucky because I
just got an email from Trek America
inviting me to go on there I check here
Vista California check-in Qun and I am
so excited I've honestly always always
always wanted to go to California we're
going to go to LA San Francisco I'm so
excited
we had to tell you that needed to just
get off my chest
I'm in central London now I just went to
buy all of them they'll want to see new
nail varnishes which look really really
lovely and I'm now about half an hour
early my next meeting so I think I'm
going to go to Topshop and spend some
money because I'm so freaking excited
also getting all the way it looks right
now snow cap okay so I never made it as
far as Topshop I went into hmmm and
their new collection is literally the
most beautiful thing in the whole world
I'm so perfect for South Africa I got so
many like tribal pieces kind of like
Chloe 1970s styles and a classic trophy
hat which I've never owned before so I'm
nicely stocked up and now I'm trying to
find ethos where my lunch meeting is
with a lovely back from Gael am so
excited to catch up with her I've heard
really good things like ethos as well so
I'm hungry
so I asked Beth if she wouldn't mind
meeting me for lunch at 11:30 and they
haven't even finished setting out food
yet and I'm the only one here this place
is really beautiful
like a boat VIP private dining
experience
I'm so excited to see our yummy bikes
right here I'm going to get an entire
plate load
ah okay so I have just got home and I'm
in a really really good mood today I'm
still kind of buzzing from that track
America email I just hasn't really sunk
in yet just sounds too good to be true
but yeah put me in a really really good
mood so I think last time I spoke to you
I said I've got to go into Topshop I
ended up going into hmmm and buying
loads of things from there and then I
had my lovely lunch meeting with fats
from Galan which was really really nice
we always have a really good catch up we
just had such good laughs we were
telling tales that I'm used to in turn
and telling horror stories about the
stuff we used to do when we both worked
in terms of different companies if you
guys think that you're all kind of
interested in that then let me know
because I do have quite a lot of tales
from Ali's intern in the fashion
industry so let me know if you'd like a
video on that just leave a little
comment saying you're interested maybe
I'll do like an interning and university
video if you think that would be
interesting again let me know umm X then
um this guy came in that's like I
recognise him I'm sure he's famous but I
couldn't remember who it was I knew that
um I did sat him at the mall refashion
show and I used to work there so I was
typing in mulberries spring/summer 12
front row and then bets Orton coming out
the toilet and she's like Jesse Douglas
booth but I just had no idea so bad at
celebrities so that was really funny and
then I went to Selfridges gosh I'm shiny
it's really hot today then I went to
Selfridges and I had a little meeting
with some of the girls from la Prairie
and I never really known much about the
brand before so it's nice to discover
the brand and they've given me serum to
try which feels amazing I had a little
sample on my hand so I'm going to give
that a whirl
later on tonight and tomorrow morning
and I'll let you know my first
impressions of it it is a pricey ones
but it feels really really lovely and
then I was walking back through
Selfridges and just spent a little bit
of time drooling over some Valentino
handbags and I don't know what it is but
when I get good news like that Trek
American email I get really really
spendy I don't know what it is I almost
feel like I need to reward myself I
didn't buy the handbag
I am seriously considering it I might
make an export order later and honestly
I don't do that kind of thing it's just
he's feeling very very spending and then
i walked through French Connection and
into miss me and Miss Selfridge and just
fell in love with everything so I have
quite literally bought half of Oxford
Street if not all Oxford Street so I'm
going to give you guys a very quick
Tryon session now from a chair Miss
Selfridge and French Connection and then
I'm going to pack the things I love
ready for holiday but I'm going to do it
super quickly because I don't this to be
a five hour long weekly vlog like last
time and let me show you all the bits
that I got so I just carried this this
this this this and this home with me
shoulders are killing okay here is the
first dress this one is from Miss
Selfridge I actually got 20% off today
with my student card this is obviously a
bit of a deep for the what so called
self portrait dresses really similar
style and super long but I think with
nice heels this all just be a really
elegant evening dress I'll give you
little close-up
I went for a size 4 quite optimistically
and it's very tight around here and like
that it's just nice and fitted so I
really like this one here is dress
number 2 I'm not sure it comes up as
nicely on camera as it doesn't really
like so it really is stunning it's like
a scalloped lace detail and you've got
these two pockets a nice bit of lining
here so you can't see my brassiere and
really lovely lady light lengths just
above my knees and then a bow fastening
I think this is going to be so nice in
South Africa it's kind of Safari style
with the collar next look the shorts I'm
not too sure on these are from hmm I
just feel like they're a little bit too
short and I don't really have the legs
for them and this top I think is very
cute I really like this off the shoulder
kind of trend I do have quite broad
shoulders so I've been a little bit
afraid of this trend in the past but I
think this is quite flattering very
simple
top way to wear this trend and another
and another
off the shoulder piece I got this blue
and white stripe top which is very
ciever you can really clearly see my bra
underneath this again the same shorts
I'm not too sure about this off a
shoulder with long sleeve but I will try
it with a few different options next
thing that I got was this dress and it's
got these tags at the side which make
you think that it will cinch in and be
really nicely fitted but actually they
don't move that much I can't get it to
cinch in any further so unfortunately
the shape is just not very nice which is
a real shame so I really love the colors
and the way that it hangs
but yeah sadly the shape is just not
working next we have this long pair of
emerald green kind of cutoff trousers I
can't decide if I like these or not I've
put them with this top which actually
has a really nice frayed bottom but the
trousers are so nice and high-waisted
that I think they're more flattering
when the top is cropped so I need to
play around with a few different tops
top however I think is really lovely
I might pair this with my trousers that
similar to this from last year that are
kind of rust colored which I featured in
my Seville outfit Diaries which is one
of my first-ever videos here's another
off the shoulder top again not I deal
with these trousers but if it was
cropped it might be this one again is
just kind of plain lace detail I think I
prefer the other one though so I need to
decide between two Charlie said I look a
bit like a South African maid in this
outfit but I think it's very cute and
kind of Old English II for touring the
vineyards and things like that I
actually forgot to film a few more bits
and pieces because I was too busy
showing Charlie and deciding what to
take but you'll see them all in my
lookbook video from South Africa I've
just spent the past hour or so trying
things on and
King for next week's trip doing pretty
well by key getting distracted by doing
online shopping I don't know what's
wrong with me today I can't stop looking
at things and browsing and being really
naughty and I've just been called
ancestors Chinese make me some nice
dinner which is this whole wheat pasta
tagliatelle some chicken leftover from
yesterday in a sweet chili Moroni miss
Vargas and some homemade pesto
okay I'm back upstairs again now I've
had a good go at packing although my
cases looking so full and I still got
two online orders to be delivered so I
think I'm going to have to be like with
more selective with what I'm taking with
me the struggle of having it far too
many clothes and but I was just
unpackaging the bits and bobs that I got
today from the events I went to and I
thought I'd really quickly show you
firstly um bury em I'm very quickly went
into a breakfast I was really late
because of the equinox gym session but
they are launching some coconut infused
nail varnish which is kind of a gel nail
varnish which is going to last two weeks
apparently and I'm a big fan of barium
nail varnishes they've always lost such
a long time so I'm looking forward to
try them out I think I'll pick my nails
in a coral color before holiday and also
in the goodie bag they gave us this
which is a barium nail varnish portable
phone charger which is so handy it's
really quite big but it's really good
for like festivals or when you're
traveling on the go maybe I'll take it
on track America with me so really
really handy I also have a this works
perfect legs sculpt and shine which is a
product that we are launching at the
workout class this morning and it's
basically a highlight of your leg so you
can put it down and in like the curve of
your muscle to make your muscles stand
out and just give a really nice glow to
your leg so that's definitely coming
with me and put that in my suitcase
morning guys I hope you're all well I'm
really sorry morning guys sorry I forgot
to finish the vlog off yesterday I just
got into a really tired mood and then I
became super unproductive forgot to do
anything useful including ending the
vlog so apologies that it's now tomorrow
but yes it's Wednesday now China I went
to the gym this morning did a good
little workout and
I had a nice pampering shower deep
conditioned my hair um and or and I
tried the new Lipari serum this morning
and oh my gosh it was heavenly honestly
the most luxurious thing I've ever put
on my face so that was amazing I'll be
doing a review on the blog soon um but
you're going to laugh but what inspired
me to pick up the vlogging camera now so
basically I've got this lipstick from
the new Tom Ford Soleil collection
actually thing this is part of the
original collection but I got it
recently and it is um oh three pink t's
and I just get such a satisfying feeling
from using a Tom Ford lipstick for the
first time because they are so beautiful
let me show you there we go so yeah
literally they are the most beautiful
lipsticks I love the TF embossing on
them and basically I just really wanted
to use this lipstick so I'm filming some
videos and but I wanted to film myself
using it for the first time because that
feeling is just such a good feeling and
but first I'm going to line my lips and
I'm going to use the Clarins lip liner
in oh three nude rows this is the
strangest thing to vlog I just you know
when you get a feeling and you want to
do something there we go lipstick done I
love this color it's not the color that
I would normally have picked you're gone
folks it's a bit more pink than my usual
brownie pink but oh my gosh what's that
going on I still got the tag on the top
so yeah absolutely beautiful color from
Tom Ford I don't think the lip liner
necessarily goes that well with it so
maybe I'll try a different one next time
but now that I've got my face ready I'm
going to be filming a few videos today
I'm going to try and film four videos
before South Africa because I'm not
going to have time between now and then
we go on Friday so wish me luck I've
taken all my filming stuff downstairs to
film in a lounge because the bedroom
that I normally film in is full of stuff
that were packing so I'm going to take
everything downstairs and start filming
okay I just finished filming the first
video that was surprisingly quick
it was my spring fashion wardrobe
essentials so you guys have seen it
already I really hope you enjoyed it and
although I think I might now ask Charlie
hello
me I might ask Charlie if he doesn't
mind filming me actually wearing the
outfits because it was very quick and I
feel like it needs a little bit more
depth so this could take a little while
so first while I'm in the mood and while
I've got the camera set up I'm gonna go
and grab some beauty products and film
my beauty video so I'll see you soon I
have officially finished filming my
spring outfit essentials let's not get
the washing in the background of that
shot I decided to film in my living room
today because the lighting in here is
really nice and I actually think I
prefer this as a background so leave a
comment on my spring edit videos on the
one that you like the background the
best because all four of them have got
different kind of setups I know the last
one is all over the place but the first
three have all got slightly different
backgrounds so leave me a comment let me
know which one is your favorite because
I could definitely change my usual
background and yeah now that it's summer
this room is so lovely and bright like
I've not got any lighting in here and
this is just how lovely and bright is so
yeah now and I just had a delivery from
ASOS which means I can finally fill my
ASOS and boxing although I haven't had
any lunch but I don't think we've got
anything in the house and I don't really
want to go out and get anything I might
serve all apostate and I'm not meant to
you having carbs before that slow or
fabrica oh I don't know what to do let's
go and have a little raid in the kitchen
the lounge is a bit of a mess because of
all the filming but it could be worse
I've definitely seen worst post filming
rooms okay let's have a look I did have
one of my tomato Tom's Tank Engine tins
earlier so not like healthiest day I
could be really naughty another mac and
cheese no I'll be good think I'm like
just half
um twiggles and while the kettle is
boiling I'm just going to tidy up all
the post filling mess
there is nothing tastier than a bowl of
plain twizzler pasta with similar pack
dev stir I'm having for my lunch hey
guys I can't actually remember when I
last picked up my camera to vlog I think
it was when I was midway through filming
some videos and gosh I look shiny
I haven't powdered for quite a while um
oh my God my phone Siri the middle
button keeps getting stuck down and
keeps calling random people anybody
knows how to solve it then please let me
know
um but yeah so I've been filling videos
all day and my camera and vlog camera
battery died so I didn't like vlog in
between but my mom just got here because
she's taking a load of clothes from my
loft to a local charity shop and I
couldn't carry them all so she's had to
come and help and um then she gave me a
lift down to my dawdle box and I've got
loads of bits and pieces to open up so
I'm gonna have a little rummage through
and then show you the highlights
so sweaty Betty you have very kindly
sent me a load of gorgeous new gym gear
I tried to do snapchat opening it but my
phone is so messed up so I'm going to
show you guys instead this is the first
outfit that I've tried on with these
gorgeous kind of specialty leggings
which I think absolutely gorgeous and
they've also sent me a black pair of
leggings and this lovely kind of yoga
fleece which I'm going to wear tomorrow
because I've got yoga at Sky garden with
them and all's tomorrow and I'm being
called Ford in it so I will show you the
rest in Tim back upstairs now after a
lovely tie green chicken curry cooked by
darling Charlie I'm having an absolute
nightmare with my phone let me show you
it won't do it now I've got the camera
but basically the Siri is non-stop going
off don't really know what's going on
it's draining my battery and it keeps
calling random people there we go so
annoying so much think my bedroom is
looking like an absolute bomb site as
half things have been sent to me today
very kindly and half things I'm in the
middle of packing my suitcase is looking
like a jumbled mess on floor and I think
Charlie wants to watch some TV and going
to bed now so I'm gonna set my alarm
maybe like 5 o'clock in the morning
because my car is coming at 7:00 and I
need to have to hide it up this and
also rich in a blog post by then so I'm
going to head to bed and I will see you
bright and early tomorrow morning for
some sky garden yoga</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
