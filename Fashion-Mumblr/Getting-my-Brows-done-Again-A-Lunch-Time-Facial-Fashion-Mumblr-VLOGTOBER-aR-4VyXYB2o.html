another daily vlog for vlog Toba today
is Friday the 21st of October and and so
far today what's happened so it is 11:30
at the moment I had my cousin's from
Lincoln stay over or my cousin and her
husband-to-be stay over last night and
also last night went to the DAR fun
dinner which hopefully saw my snapchat
because it was stunning it was at the
spring restaurant in Somerset house and
they just decked out the room so
beautifully I'll insert a photo here if
I can and I just spent the past half an
hour talking through the new launches on
the Instagram story so I won't go into
tons of detail but basically I just want
to tell you about really really quickly
cuz I'm in love these are the two new
launches the range is Lumiere essential
and it's all about it's all about kind
of adding oil into your skincare routine
even if you don't like the consistency
of oil so the serum is a water-based
steering with oil droplets suspended in
it and it's really good for illuminating
the skin I already love it and used it
twice and then this is an oil gel cream
and dolphin is a really luxurious
skincare routine but I feel like these
products are a bit more accessible for
like our kind of age so let me know if
you want to hear more about that um
check on my Instagram stories it might
still be there were Thomas fog goes up
and like leaks got a bit of a backlog
but yeah I'll write about it if you want
to hear more about it and if I get along
really well with it so yeah but I just
briefly mentioned that what else I done
today I've edited a video I've edited
the video from our trip to Soho
farmhouse you guys have seen that
already I got a very exciting delivery
from Alton Brown they came straight to
the house which is really cool and
dropped off a molten Brown advent
calendar so probably going to do part 2
of my unboxing of Beauty advent
calendars because you seem to really
like that last one
and um I have got a plan in my head
about how I'm gonna like do vlogmas and
let's just say there's going to be some
epic giveaways when I do block of us so
I don't know wish you I know van bucks
is one of my favorite months because
it's my birthday and yeah blogger Merce
is going to be amazing and I'm going to
be spoiling you guys rotten it's going
to be so many things I'm going to give
away so I feel like I have to say thank
you well I want to say thank you to all
of you guys that have subscribed
and we're getting close to 70,000
subscribers well close we're on like 62
but you know it's just it's approaching
and that's just an insane number so
there's gonna be tons of giveaways this
vlogmas is like a huge thank you so i
hope you're excited for that
if you don't miss vlogmas make sure you
subscribe because i would hate for you
to miss out on all the festivities and
the giveaways so yeah why should I stop
talking about vlogmas advent calendar
yes I'm Alton Brown and dropped off a
mortar round advent calendar so later on
I will probably film another Advent
unboxing but actually so today and I'm
about to go into town now I'm going into
London I'm meeting the PR Elizabeth
Arden we're going to grab lunch together
and then I'm getting an Elizabeth Arden
facial which i think is in Harvey Nick
so I'm not too sure I'll take you along
with me anyway so you'll get to see and
and then I'm getting my eyebrows re
tattooed so um as you probably know I
got the micro bladed out two months ago
with Sean Taylor and I absolutely fell
in love with it love the process loved
how they looked but they really
dramatically faded at the moment you
can't really see that much um of the
micro bleeding so it's not very in a
focus it's not working and yeah you
can't really see that much of the micro
bleeding only very very small amounts so
I'm going to get it done again and this
time I'm not going to pick the scabs
because I feel like that's why a lot of
it faded because I did actually like
pick a lot of it off which I shouldn't
have done and also sometimes people's
skin rejects to die the first time you
do it and I think that's what happened
to me so I'm going to do it again not
pick and hope my skin accepts the die
because I do want to have perfect
eyebrows and I'm trying my hardest to
get them so yes I will take you along
too that you can see the process I won't
do in as much detail if you want to see
the whole micro braiding micro bleeding
process I'll leave the video down below
to when I logged it properly including
like some close-ups of her scraping away
in my face so yes I'll do that link down
below and then I'm coming home again I
might go to a hairdressers actually and
get a patch test on cuz I'm going to get
my hair bleached because I'm just bored
of this color so I need to get patch
tests I might go to old Street as well
because I'm picking up a handbag from
far fetch I'm just borrowing a handbag
um you see bloggers on Instagram with
all you designer handbags a lot of the
time they're borrowed so don't think
that we're like super rich
have all this money to blow on designer
handbags obviously a few of them are
bought but a lot of the handbags you see
on Instagram especially people that seem
to have a new designer handbag every
week it's very very likely that that
handbag is borrowed so she's being
totally open with you I'm gonna go and
borrow a handbag because I want to take
some photos with it it's so pretty
so yeah and then I'm coming back home
and China I gonna have an evening in
because Charlie has been in Manchester
he is doing insanely well so he started
his blog like three months ago
and already like last night he was
invited to Manchester by a hotel company
stayed in the hotel and Charlie's been a
man you found like his entire life and
has always wanted to go and watch game
at Old Trafford and last night the
brands were like oh we've got a VIP box
for the for the UEFA Cup game do you
want to come and watch so they did they
went and they watch a cup game in a VIP
box at Old Trafford so Charlie's living
the dream and it's all thanks to his
blog so if you've not um red choice blog
I'll leave that link down below from I'm
proud girlfriend over here it's just
amazing that he is doing it as well
um right I need to go so I'm meeting the
lady for lunch in half an hour and I do
not want to be rude and I'm gonna be
late because um yeah takes me more than
half an hour here senator London so I've
seen it
okay so I in the treatment room in
Debenhams and I'm wearing a very sexy
sarong this is the Elizabeth Arden
treatment room and they've just
relaunched or redouble counters it's now
their flagship counter and it's
beautiful you just saw a little Pam and
I'm about to get a facial and it's like
loads of things in one so LED treatment
hot stone massage cold stone massage I
think a little bit of extraction
microblaze microdermabrasion
I'm really excited so I'll let you know
how I get along afterwards this room is
so cute this is the red door and this
all of our like mr. Thornton has the
iconic Red Door and this is all designed
based on their spot in New York which is
like their flagship star it's really
beautiful and holy this is a locksmith
Street perfect place to comes like a
lunchtime facial so pan around so
gorgeous so I'm gonna lay down relax and
guys in store an hour
just come out of my Elizabeth Arden
facial in Debenhams and it was
absolutely heavenly I think I was
probably in there for about an hour
maybe a little bit longer totally
chilled out I had all kinds of things I
had microdermabrasion and then when I
held the camera over my face that was
like a electronic extraction so sucking
all of the dirt and crap out of my skin
so satisfying and so much easier and
quicker and less painful than manual
extraction so that was amazing and I
feel like my skin is glowing feels
really fresh free cream or fresh so
clean and and it has reminded me how
much I love the Elizabeth Arden at
ceramide capsule so I definitely need to
add those to my shopping list and I've
just got to the back of Oxford Street
and I'm going to Harley Street now to
Chandeleur
but also I want to tell you something
about Elizabeth Arden so next week
starting for the 24th - actually in a
few days maybe even now I depend on
where this goes live they're doing a red
door takeover of Debenhams which is
going to be absolutely insane so for 15
pounds one five and you can go to this
event and you get a 45 minute
consultation all about your skin you get
the 15 pounds redeemable against
products and you get a goodie bag with
60 pounds so it's such a good deal and
that's 24th to the 30th of October it's
going to be like a massive Elizabeth
Arden takeover so I'll leave my
information down in the description box
if you would like to check that out
because it's actually the best deal ever
so good if you want to try out a few new
Elizabeth Arden products yeah definitely
check out that link and highly recommend
the facial definitely need to do
something like that a little bit more
often and I have now gone the wrong way
because I was talking to you guys
instead of concentrating so I'm gonna
head into shawndala's little
appointment area and I will see you in
there for growl micro bleeding part two
if you look behind me you'll see a
little blob of photo shoot going on in
the middle of the road I love that in
London you're just wandering around and
you can see people doing their street
style photos so money and then there's
idiots like me wandering around with a
camera as well you almost think an
absolute lunatic talking to myself but
so I'm back in Sean's office as you can
see and I've been very told off the
scratching it before and I'm promised
John I'm not going to do it this time so
I'm going through the process for round
two and we're working on before I have
perfect rappers
you
so happy
got the pigment on which is settling
into the little scratches and in about a
minute or so we'll wipe it all away to
repent I've just come out of Sean's and
treatment room and we are all done I
have brows again that was probably like
an hour long appointment really really
quick and compared to the first one I'd
say the actual like a scratchy was a bit
less painful and but then when she put
the color on where I showed you a nice
big hairy brows that was a little bit
more stinky but maybe it's because I had
the feature beforehand which pretty was
in the best of ideas so this time I'm
not going to scratch them because she
was saying how obviously micro bleeding
is so close for surface skin that if you
scratch it you're just scratching away
all the colour so that's probably why my
brows faded last time so this time I
will not be scratching and hopefully
they will last as
so fingers crossed because I hope they
will stay like this because they see
look I love the shape so I'm gonna now
hop on the bus boom again catch up with
some emails
I'll see you guys
back home again now and the brows are
looking and feeling good my face is
really shining snoring you want to put
too much makeup on so please excuse my
appearance and so yeah Charlie and I are
home and we've just ordered an Indian
and it's going to be a very chilled
Friday evening we're just going to catch
up on some TV we might watch The
Apprentice we need to catch up on that
and enjoy our cheat meal not a terribly
healthy evening we've made the lounge
all cozy for our evening in we've got
the fire on behind me some candles lit
so it smells really nice and festive in
here very autumnal stop God my face
looks so shiny but I had a close up
inspection of my skin in the mirror a
minute ago and it is so clear that
facial has literally got all the dirt
out of my chin and my nose which is so
satisfying you know and you just said
inspect your skin and you can't see any
blackheads that is the sign of a good
facial so I'm definitely going back
there to try out a few more um yeah the
eyebrows feel fine that whole area feels
a teeny teeny bit tingly but I'm really
really pleased with the shape of them so
excited to see how they heal I'm going
to go and help Charlie plate up so I
will speak to you locally
you
just come upstairs we've had our Indian
it was delicious and then we watched
watch The Apprentice and then watched
the hunted which we've been quite
enjoying recently got rather heated
while watching The Apprentice because
get over watch it and just shouting at
the TV because you're so angry with them
and you just feel like you could do the
job a million times battered like so
many things that they do just so basic I
don't know I just whenever I watch it
I'm like I need to go on that show
because I feel like I could do a much
better job than what they're doing um so
yeah the time now is quarter to nine is
8:41 and I'm already ready for bed
Charlie had a late one last night
because he was in Manchester watching a
football game and I got about six hours
sleep last night because as I think I
mentioned earlier my cousins were over
and then I got up early this morning to
get some work done so yeah I've got a
little bit early to catch up on as well
so Charlie's just coming upstairs in a
second he is just going to unpack his
case from the weekend and then I think
I'll just watch like a film in bed or
something but to be honest both of us
will probably be asleep by half-past
nine so wild Friday night in the fair
and ions household so yeah I'm gonna end
the vlog here and tomorrow it's Saturday
my mum's coming for a roast I think one
of Charlie's male bloggers pals Nathan's
coming over to I've got a car to order
coming so yeah be a thrilling day
tomorrow I might make some nice healthy
pancakes I got the Madelon Shores first
cookbook the other day and she's got a
recipe for almond and banana pancakes
and my try making that in the morning
and then I think I'll open a load of
blogger mail for you as well cuz I think
I have an exciting package waiting for
me a doddle so yes that's all to look
forward to in tomorrow's video so I hope
you guys enjoyed this one and I hope
