is going to be another daily vlog or
it's actually probably going to span two
days because I don't really feel like
I'm doing enough to either today or
tomorrow to do like a daily vlog so
you're going to get a Tuesday and
Wednesday vlog from me today I am
feeling super autumnal with my whole
look today I'm going to just quickly
show you an outfit of the day um and
then I'm going to dash out so today on
the agenda I'm going to the moniker of
another store in Chelsea to start with
to meet the girls from the brands I
think they're going to show me their new
collections I couldn't make that press
play unfortunately um and then I'm going
to I think it's called the Chelsea
dental clinic but I'm meeting a lady
called Rona who does teeth contouring
and I'm just a little bit nervous but
also excited to see what she recommends
for me and I've always like been on a
mission to get perfect teeth as you know
I've got the clear braces from your
smile direct and I heard about teeth
contouring when I went to a Phillips
event and Rohnert is kind of like a
Philips ambassador as you know I'm a big
fan of the Philips Sonicare it's my like
daily toothbrush which I swear by and um
I spoke to Rona about potentially like
chiseling down some of my teeth which
are a bit fang-like so you can see a lot
of my teeth aren't really um not they're
not straight but they're not like the
bottom line isn't straight yeah you see
err I mean um see our owner basically
creates perfect smiles so I'm really
looking forward to going for my
consultation with her I don't know she's
actually gonna do the treatment today I
could have filing and adding in some
more tooth that was crazy and really
really interesting then I'm going to
head to Oxford Street got a few errands
to run I've got to get a patch test I
said that in my last vlog but I forgot
to do it and I've also got to go to
Selfridges go to click and Collect and
pick up my new laptop because I ordered
a new MacBook on click and Collect a
couple of days ago so I'm going to go
and pick that up and then
might go to a press day or two there's a
few press days on today so I'm going to
head into those then I'm going to
debenhams back to the others with odds
and things doesn't event there tonight
gosh it sounds like quite a lot of stuff
so maybe I could do a daily vlog we'll
see how I get on and then tomorrow's
another day full of meetings and events
as well so this is going to be kind of
another day in the life of a blogger but
a more exciting version so let me give
you an out for the day and then we'll
head outside okey-dokey
so hair I don't think it's going to stay
looking this nice unfortunately but I
killed it yesterday didn't like it
yesterday but it's quite nice today
these curls were created with my GHD
copper platinum stylus and yeah I just
really like these big curls so then my
top this is a really super snuggly
jumper from next I'll leave it linked
down below as always and it's actually
got Navy down at the bottom but I've got
it tucked in so you can't see the Navy
bit but yeah it's navy gray and camel
stripes of the really nice high roll
neck just love it so much and of course
I have got a thermal top on underneath
there it is just sneaking out there as
you guys know I'm always wearing my
thermals especially during this time of
year then this is a new skirt I got this
recently from River Island I was going
to film a haul video and I still might
do but I've just unboxed everything so
so much stuff that I wanted to wear and
then my boots which I got a few weeks
ago from mango actually got them on ASOS
love them and this is my first day
wearing black tights for 2016 autumn
winter season so it feels nice and
snuggly and I also got a new coat from
River Island as well so I'm going to
give this a try
hopefully whoops hopefully this will
look nice okay so here's the code I
really really like it but I feel like
it's too big so the shoulders just look
a little bit broad and there's just like
a ton of fabric I don't dislike it but
yeah I just feel like it's really really
big on me not sure what to do I might
try on a different one and see if I can
get this one in a smaller size because I
love it and I feel like it'd be really
nice like you know just stick it on over
everything and be super super warm and
snuggly
but yeah looks a tad big on me don't you
think this is more like it so this one I
also got from River Island I've really
been looking for some new coats recently
and I
slow providing coats this one as you can
see is a leopard print it's got these
gold metallic buttons and a really
really soft faux fur coat it keeps
hurting when I raise my eyebrows I keep
forgetting that I've got like little
cuts obviously on my face and but yeah
this is the super smooth and soft collar
and it's nice and I'm wearing a roll
neck with it because then I won't get
makeup all over the lovely fur so ya
need to take out this bag spare Run
button you've got these little pockets
so really really like this one looks
quite cute with the whole outfit so now
that I've decided on my coat
it's time to go so I'm here at the
Chelsea dental clinic and with the
lovely Rona and we're about to do some
teeth contouring which is very very
exciting so Bruno is explaining that
she's going to file a tummy forget names
yeah going to file down a little bit of
my front teeth because they're a little
bit bumpy along the top here and then
also going to build up and filing down
these canines which are a little bit on
the pointy side and then build my teeth
up so they are all even yeah absolutely
yeah so wish me luck
and I'm done already that was so quick I
think I was only in there for like half
an hour I don't know how much you can
see from like this far away but
basically she did what I was explaining
earlier she filed down the front one
made my canines a little bit softer and
then Rona was going through the whole
process with me onwards and basically
saying out she's made my smile a little
bit more symmetrical and it's a lot
softer but still really really natural
so excited I'm going to show you some
close-up clips and I get home some in
the middle of the street here and I feel
like people might think I'm a little bit
crazy
hello again I am back home now as you
can probably tell by the annoying
mattress behind me honestly I need to
get round to listing it on gumtree it's
been too long
um so I've just got home and Charlie met
me at dawdle what is my hair doing I
don't know need to get it colored um
let's just ignore my hair yes so Charlie
met me at dawdle and we picked up some
blogger mail and we have been sent quite
a few sausage dog related pieces haven't
we Rooney yes so I'm gonna quickly show
you a few of the sausage dog bits so
this is mine and Dexter's sausage dog
Paul but we've just got to let Dexter
have a look through it all first haven't
we my rooney my silly boy look at those
little chops Oh so as you can see and
oMG these are so soft we've really
kindly been sent know these another toy
some sausage dog slippers and these are
from Jules they are 24 pound 95 from
Jules you can see the little jewels leg
on the sole they've got pink lining and
oh my gosh it is so cute so we've got
the front of the dog on one shoe and
then it's little bootie on the other and
then when you add them together it is a
sausage look it's like you mr. Rooney
how cute is that he loves them he loves
them so much and then we have to know
sausage we have two sausage dog plates I
love that the Jules sausage dog looks
like Dexter even with the light brown
socks like Dexter's got your twins is
your twin mr. Suzie's blanket and also
from Jules this has not got a sausage
dog on it but this is a gift so Charlie
you went to that press day didn't you
and I designed this for Dexter so has
Dexter in gold so Dexter has his very
own scarf maybe we can use this as like
a blank
get for him is so cute that's for you
mr. sausage this is not how I like it
these nice so funny sausages for your
sausage
but we also have more so we've got
sausage dog oven gloves how cute are
these oh my god I just love it so once
again with Dexter wearing pink
spectacles what's this what's this what
does this say silly sausage
actually yeah that's it so this is a
pink stripy one that says silly sausage
look at this and finally a bright yellow
tea towel once again with a sausage dog
on it and what have you just opened up
Charles
ah he's got me bed oh my gosh if you
love Jules have completely spoilt us
look at that Rooney that day please
raise Ebert its fancy I'm stopping it I
can be back again is new bed would you
think to all of these treats mr. Rooney
come on deck see look at one of these
treats oh yeah
no one doesn't love you you're the best
dog in the world
come on anyway ah new bed for mr.
sausage it had a new bed for Melanie you
meant to teach her Dexter has been
utterly spoiled here he is trying out
his new bed how do you think so Paige
oh he says I love it I love it Thank You
Jules for sending me lots of sausage
pieces so I'm gonna quickly unbox and
the rest of the bloggers mail then
Charlie and I are gonna cook gonna watch
meat in Chelsea got boys going on um and
yeah probably gonna do a little bit of
work got a few emails to get through and
then just chill out this evening and I
didn't really talk about my teeth
contouring so yeah obviously you heard a
little bit about the process it wasn't
painful it was about 45 minutes it the
only thing that was a bit weird was um
are you doing sausage
having a scratch the only thing that was
a bit weird was obviously they she news
like a drill and it was kind of
vibrating and being all oh he just
probably snugged me look you see my
mommy
Dexter obviously likes my new teeth and
yeah it was kind of like an electric
nail file that she used to file down my
teeth shape tooth shape before she added
this bonding material on top and then
she buffed that down so that's pretty
much the whole process so it's really
really easy and now the bottom of my
teeth are a lot more straight and in a
line as opposed to being a little bit
wonky like they were before so very very
pleased with that um I'm going to be
doing a video all about my teeth um in a
week or so so let me know if you're
excited for that one Charlie's getting
very excited about another piece of log
of Melwood is a darling look they are
smart light bulbs so we can change them
with an app so we can change color so
for Halloween's give me epic because you
can make more red all right look at
Dexter looking at you and we kill to be
fair it's gonna be pretty cool because
we can turn on our outdoor light on
before we get home without having to
have a sensor and this one's for outside
though and like my new bird he loves it
look morning guys sorry I didn't finish
the blog properly last night I we just
had dinner went to bed so you don't
really miss too much and it is Wednesday
morning today I have just got up and got
dressed and about to head out for
today's meetings I'm having a very you
know can't remove others do too much
with my hair or outfit today so I've
just gone for a low ponytail and then
I've got a jumper on which actually I
really really like this jumper and then
I've got my a sauce trousers and mango
boots on again absolutely love this
combination so I'm about to head out
today I'm feeling really sad that I'm
going to miss Dexter for another day I
was feel really bad leaving him at home
but Charlie's working from home again
today but I'm gonna miss my little boy
but my first meeting the lady that I'm
meeting in Liberty she is supposedly
bringing her sausage dogs so I'm excited
to give him a little bit of a kiss and
his name is Louie as well like mums dog
so excited to give a little Louis and
kisses
felicia does bring him and then I am
going to Selfridges I've got a meeting
in Selfridges we're going to have lunch
there hopefully and then I've got a
coffee meetings or lots of meetings
today I'm going to try and pop into a
couple of press days as well hopefully
Charlie's going to come with me to one
of them and ideally I need to get some
like photos of this lipstick so I'm
doing a sponsored Instagram for Rimmel
but I don't know my hair is probably too
bad take an Instagram photo today I'll
take on camera with me just in case and
what else didn't pick up my laptop
yesterday so I need to do that from
Selfridges and then I'm going to coast
to pick up some clothes for some winter
photoshoots
so it's something quite a busy day lots
of meetings and once again I'm running
late so I'm not going to run ball let's
just get going
so I've got no idea if you can hear me
right now a little bit windy sorry I
haven't spoken to since breakfast time
my hand breakfast with messy mammals and
jewelry company at Liberty campaign and
the PR lady did bring her sausage or so
Louie and marine and I had a really
lovely breakfast it's nice to get some
puppy kisses and I'm sorry I'm just
trying to find out where my next meeting
is I'm a little bit lost and then I went
to the Karen and melon press day which
is really really nice so many pieces
I've got my eye on spring/summer so
excited to get launched and I'm now in a
really public place so I think I'm going
to stop talking for a second I'll talk
you in two minutes okay
I'm in stitches my next meeting in the
cafe I'm about to meet Devon's but I
just had two glasses of champagne at my
lunch with
so a little bit tipsy which is probably
not the most professional thing but yeah
I'm just keeping an eye out for lady I'm
about to meet with I don't normally do
this but I totally forgot I'm not much
of a lightweight I am so yeah I need to
stop having champagne during work
meetings so my breakfast with mercy my
mom was really cool I didn't realize how
powerful of the Kate Middleton effectors
they said that their company was six
people six people and then Kate
Middleton wore one of their bracelets or
necklaces and the company just went so
ridiculous because everybody wanted to
buy it because she wore it that they now
have like 25 people working for them and
their whole company's blew up like 10
times the size all because Kate
Middleton wore it so that is the power
of getting someone to wear your design
so that sells are you crazy and then I
went to the Karen Millen frost day which
is really beautiful I told you very
briefly about that so many nice designs
definitely have my eye on a few things
for spring/summer 17
and then I went to Selfridges restaurant
on the river crossed on the roof for
some food it's really nice where I had
the two glasses of champagne and now
I've come to Warren Street I'm at a
place called the refinery meeting the
yeah the PRP debenhams so she's going to
be here any second I'm overheating and I
really need to sober up because I cannot
meet Debenhams being this tipsy and yeah
I'm vlogging in the cafe people must
think I'm so weird I'm going to stop
talking now am i soon okay guys so since
I last saw you
something drastic has happened I'll
explain when I get home home again and I
felt like the biggest Shopaholic walking
down Oxford Street with all of this
stuff like I look like an insane
Shopaholic person but I promise I do
have reason behind all of it and so as I
think I mentioned earlier I had to go to
Selfridges and pick up my laptop so I've
been needing a new laptop for ages
because my current MacBook Pro that I
edit on is so slow and not very good for
traveling cuz it's really big and bulky
so I decided to treat myself to a new
one this is the MacBook I think it is a
pro twelve inch notebook with Retina
display and of course I got the rose
gold one so I'm going to open that up in
a second and show you guys that and then
because it's really weird and only has
like one say one hole in it one what's
the word like one hole in it I haven't
you had an adapter so this will
hopefully allow me to plug USB stuff in
so yeah I need to also get a memory card
reader because my current laptop you can
just stick a memory card in and it's
done whereas this one doesn't have any
holes oh yeah
and then these bits and bobs are all
from coast so on my blog very soon
you'll be seeing a Christmas lookbook so
I'm actually working with coast and to
create lots of nice images for their
festive season and wait until you see
these outfits I didn't
not even realize you get dresses this
nice on the high street they are
stunning
I just I'm pretty gonna get them all on
coat hangers so I'll show you either
later on in today's vlog or in
tomorrow's vlog depending how I get
along time wise um and then a cup of the
carrier bags often press days so I went
to the Melissa Oda bash press day and
that's like the really lovely swimwear
and then I have a meeting this morning's
I had little getting back from that too
is that actually it's not as bad as it
seems but it is an awful lot of stuff um
and then if you are a little magpie you
might have spotted this misguided bag in
the background and this is actually
something that's really really amazing
and a nice perk of being a blogger so
basically as you know I'm a big shopper
holic hello Dexter sorry I obviously
wasn't giving him enough attention but
yes as you know I do love misguided and
I shop from that a lot I've done quite a
lot of calls with them recently
um and amazingly I got an email from
their PR saying that she that bit saying
that she would like to give me a few
pieces to say kind of like thank you am
i boring you
this is a boring conversation is it yes
because it doesn't involve sausage dogs
but yeah she is basically said John and
chew some pieces and will give them to
you for free so I was like as insane of
course I'm going to say yes so thank you
very much misguided I will show you
again I'm really don't have enough
energy tonight to open up all of this
but I will probably show you in my next
vlog what I picked up so that's really
really nice when brands do that I mean
doesn't cost them that much to spend a
few pieces over but this is really
really nice for me um that they wanted
to say thank you for the videos I've
done so yeah that's very nice little
gift from misguided I also have a
beautiful bunch of flowers downstairs
that a company called bloom I think
that's right bloom sent me and just to
promote their floral service I'll show
you that bunch of flowers and I get
downstairs it's so pretty and then
Charlie very kindly went to dawdle while
I was on my way home so I've got a ton
of
blogger mail as well so quite a lot to
go through and but yeah I might do it
later on tonight
Charlie's cooked a Thai green chicken
curry so I'm going to get out of this
outfit probably going to leave the
jumper on put some pajama bottoms on and
sand
long sigh killing and even though these
are my comfy shoes I feel like I've been
doing a lot of walking today around
Oxford Street and so yeah me getting
something comfy have some food and then
maybe I will do a little bit or fun
boxing so I thought I would just prop
you guys up over there and open up my
laptop for you god me to not stab myself
because I don't know about you but I
find it very satisfying opening up new
Apple products there is something about
that packaging so sleek that I just love
so open this up oh she's so free in the
box
looking all perfect then you have this
little flap sorry this is not like a
proper unboxing this is just me getting
to laptop out the box and then it's got
this like plastic cover over it this
protective cover can I take it out of so
tiny compared to the laptop I've got now
look how tiny it is and by the way in
case you're wondering why I bought it
from Selfridges and not from Apple it's
because I prefer their um like customer
service so if anything goes wrong with
this I can take it back to Selfridges
I'm not too Apple because I find Apple
pretty shit when it comes to customer
service so that's why I got it from soft
jizz inside oh my God look how thin it
is this is so minuscule it's so tiny
like literally it weighs nothing
that is beautiful nude pink I love it
so let's see what else is in the box
we've got gosh that's really tiny that
is the charging cable I'm hoping there's
gonna be a plug oh yeah got a plug um
screen and adapter yeah that's it that's
all this in the box so I'm going to turn
it on
and have a little play it's so good how
tiny this is I bet it doesn't fit my
handbag though oh my god guys it fits in
the Gucci bag that is amazing I can't
really fit much else in the handbag if I
put my laptop in there but it's good to
know that if I need to do work on the go
it does fit just about okay so I'm going
to go and like log myself in set up my
emails and have a little play with my
new toy
now have some dinner and it's the Great
British Bake Off final tonight so let me
go downstairs and chill out for a little
bit wish for the main language the
return oh my god okay that's scare the
living shit out of me it's talking even
though it's shut that's really weird
I'm gonna go and sort this out um and
I'll see you guys bit later
okie dokie it is half past 9:00 and
Charlie now I'm gonna go to bed now okay
no yes really late for us actually do
getting into pressure wash the whole
sauce Charlie wants to show you his Star
Wars socks here we go bring them closer
that's radical stance how is that Star
Wars I don't get it
oh it's a storm it's one of those fights
you don't know what it's called hmm
apparently that effect I don't really
know what that is just looks like a
strange person to me but try this very
excited by his style with socks and yes
