be an amazing two days here at Soho
farmhouse and I'm here with origins so
we just arrived about 20 minutes ago and
we have gone straight into creating our
own lunches Madeleine short is the
origin hello girl and so she's here and
she's taking us through one of her
recipes for courgette and halloumi
frittatas and right now we are in the
Soho farmhouse garden we are just taking
ingredients for our lunch
around the garden and picked up our
ingredient and we're now back in the
main kind of food hall area and we're
going to make courgette and halloumi
mini frittatas from Madeline's book
so after an absolutely delicious lunch
at work feeling so full we made the
Beauty Buddha bowl which is so I think I
just showed the round bowl very colorful
and then it's the Eco shots fritters so
tasty I've got all of its in little
ticker box to eat later
and we're now having a little workshop
in the room next door which is just so
photogenic they're having tea we're
having cakes and we're finding out about
the new origins products is which I
would hang out later so let's go and see
what they're all about
okay so update time we have just
finished our little workshop learning
about the ritual of tea collection which
I will show you in great detail in a
second because it is amazing I'm already
in love with it
and then we did 10 minutes of meditation
with Madeline and she was basically just
explaining how we're all so busy at the
moment we just spend so long doing like
emails or on social media or watching
Netflix and we don't really take time
for ourselves so just by pressing pause
on daily life and taking a few minutes
just breathe it just chills you out so
much and enables you to be more
productive for the rest of your day and
it's just so good for you to relax and
helps the all kinds of things like
anxiety which of course is affecting
quite a lot of people at the moment so
yeah we're all feeling very refreshed
and chilled out after our little 10
minutes of meditation that's all it
takes ten minutes and now after a little
break in proceedings we have just come
to our campsite and I'll show you the
cattle side in a second as you can
probably see I'm currently in my tent
and when I say tent this is not like any
other tent that I've ever seen before
let me show you
so panning around here is the tent how
beautiful is this we have the new I've
got the match a collection right here so
this is what we were just playing with
this is a body mask so you put it on all
over your body like you would a scrub
and then just leave it maybe ten minutes
I think that's how long I left mind when
I tried it earlier I'm not doing before
and you had just enjoy the feeling
before scrubbing it off and then this is
a face mask that you mix yourself with
water and we're trying it later as you
can see this is the match of flavor you
mix it with water to ever consistency
you like and it's just the most amazing
experience these are out on the 9th of
September so not too long to wait and
then here is the kind of like a spoon
spatula
and a mixing bowl which has been
designed by a Californian surfer so
basically it's got like a rim here which
bends over slightly so you don't flick
the facemask every which is great and
then that they've also collaborated with
positivity so I've got the green tea
jasmine and rose and these teas
basically they help your energy so
whether you're feeling little bit low or
you just want to be you know a little
bit more active then these teas are a
really good solution for that so back to
the tent I've got my little log burner
here by the door just so cozy imagine
being here in winter be so so nice I've
got a little bookshelf over here a fan
little bin bedside table so over here I
have got my little information pieces a
little note welcome to the origins
wellness retreat and then oh this is
fabulous I've got a mindfulness journal
I think this is Kiki Kay I think it is
so I can just make little mindful notes
everyday throughout the year it's like a
little little diary got our itinerary so
the next thing today is dinner Oh
cocktails and canapes in the courtyard
that sounds good and then here is a
little bit of information about the tips
and all the different teas as you can
see just amazing bed I have never seen
attempt anything like this and then I've
got some dressing gowns some Soho House
dressing gowns little slippers and also
oh look at this some lovely origins
goodies shower off exfoliating body wash
cooling moisturizer eye makeup remover
exfoliator and the good old ginseng
collection so pretty amazing tent as you
can see I think I'm gonna go and meet
Alex now we're going to going to take
some photos because the whole place is
so photogenic so I'll take you around
with me
so Alex and I are having a little tour
of the Soho farmhouse we are walking
around and just hang a bit of an
explorer taking a few photos I'm
currently in the garden house / orange
tree or Green Room and I'm pretty much
vlogging here because they don't really
allow photos in the Soho House
properties so we're trying to be a
little bit subtle about it so I'll just
do a silent tour address of the property
but yeah we're in the green house now
are lots of ingredients here that you
would find in like the meals that we
made earlier and also in your skincare
there's some lemongrass like ham while
over there so yeah really beautiful
really warm and so I'm not gonna ramble
too much because then I'll be super
duper late but basically Alex and I just
had a lovely work session basically I
say lovely but we just had a nice
cocktail took our laptops to the little
bar by the pool and did a bit of work
which is very nice really good
strawberry mojito which I've still got
I'm the world's slowest drinkers I've
still got most of it here that's really
I mean and I'm just now going to top up
my makeup and get changed
ready for dinner which is in the
Japanese restaurant so I'm not gonna
ramble I'm just gonna get ready
super-speedy change Alex and I are ready
for dinner
and I realized I've been saying Alex
night and I have not told you - Alex's
this is Alex's locker as well I will
leave Alex Instagram here you can all go
and follow Alex and we are just gonna go
and have dinner where we hang for it
Japanese Japanese sushi yeah
right here
this morning I went for a really lovely
swim which was very refreshing seven
o'clock in the morning and the pool was
really lovely and warm so that was a
beautiful way to start the day and then
we as we had sunrise yoga although yoga
with a sweaty ambassador and my outfit
is 30 30 including these gorgeous new
leggings so that was a lovely way to
start the day lots of nice stretches and
then Alex and I yeah well in a good way
avocado on toast and cheer Bowl banana
bread and suddenly we are leaving in
just under an hour so we're just gonna -
around take some more photos because
this place if Instagram goals
hello me again I am at home now as you
can probably tell not in the beautiful
surroundings of Soho farmhouse but I
just wanted to end the vlog because
basically we had a really lovely morning
we had breakfast we went and took load
of photos and then suddenly it was time
to leave our taxis were there rushed us
to chow Barry's children child something
station and we headed back home so I
didn't really vlog anymore at so at
farmhouse I just wanted to say thank you
so much for watching the vlog and
Origins if you're watching thank you so
much for the most fabulous it's two days
it was just so lovely to escape in
London and experience the farmhouse but
also to just kind of put work on hold
for a little while and focus on
ourselves and I think that's the whole
point of this whole trip was that it
really is so badiy board focused on a
little bit of me time and if you're not
writing yourself then you can't help
other people you can't do your work
properly so just taking those few
moments out to pamper yourself is really
really important and the new collection
from origins is just so perfect for
doing that
I love that you mix it up yourself it's
just so much fun and I cannot wait to
use it again and yeah I will be talking
about it a lot more on my blog snapchat
and all that so keep a lookout and as I
said the face masks and body mass cut
outs on September the 9th so keep a look
out for those but yeah I just wanted to
sign off and say thank you for watching
and I will see you very very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
