for the second week of February that's a
really nice catchy title I'm gonna have
to think of a better one it's Tuesday
afternoon right now I didn't really vlog
yesterday don't really have an excuse
why I just didn't I blogged Valentine's
weekend so I thought I'd have a bit of a
rest yesterday um so this weekly vlog is
going to be a little bit hair-related
because I'm going to get my hair done
colored in an hour or so at grow near
where I live and on Thursday I've got a
hair related photo shoot so I did get
caught through a car I do get quite a
lot of questions about my hair so I
thought this would be a good opportunity
to do a hair vlog yeah
that's what this is a vlog about my hair
so this is my hat you guys have seen it
before I'm sure I have got long ish
blonde hair not natural my natural color
is this color here boy that's a
flattering angle isn't it um yeah so
kind of laughs that's really gross I'm
not going to show you that but again but
yeah that's my natural hair color it's
kind of a dark brown and I like to get
it colored this really nice bright shiny
blonde so that's what I'm going to do
later I'm going to grow to get it
colored and they're going to do a root
touch-up probably balayage that's what I
normally ask for because I find that
it's quite a natural way of getting the
color that I like oh it was a spot on
the camera I thought I had something
weird going on my eyebrows I do have
something weird going on with my
eyebrows because look at this growth I
didn't have time to go to benefit brow
town last week so I have got scary
werewolf brows yeah not really sure what
else to tell you before I head onto the
hairdresser's about my hair yeah this is
it really not really sure what else to
tell you about my hair
that you don't already know I did do a
hair routine video a little while ago so
if you've got any questions about my
hair
then check that out I will tell you how
I got these kind of old now big curls
and
I have recently become addicted to the
new GH D curve big tongue barrel not
sure the official name I will show it to
you it is this large barrel item here
this is what I use to create my waves if
I'm feeling really fancy I will pin them
up and let them cool down which is what
I did yesterday with these curls but
yeah they've kind of dropped out a
little bit now but you can steal steal
we're gonna come talk you can still see
a little bit of shape there so that's
that's what I use um yeah everything
else is pretty much in my hair routine
video but now I'm going to tidy up my
filming room because well let me show
you it's just a real on site basically
it has changed the bedsheets because I
got concealer all over the bed so I've
just been using the best dumping ground
so I'm gonna tidy this room up now
before I go to get my head
hey guys it's Thursday morning now it's
bright light outside so I can show you
my gorgeous new hair color done by Alex
at grow cotton north I actually I'm in
love with this color I basically showed
him a few photos on Pinterest and I said
can you make me look like that and yeah
he pretty much did exactly what I asked
for it's quite an ashy blonde so
definitely closer to my natural color
less of this orange blonde that I was
kind of going down that route so I
really really love it it's quite a
change for me and think it's a little
bit more mature but more luxurious so
thank you very much Alex I got a few
shots trying to find good light where
the hair looks like this most natural
color I think I got a few shots in the
salon and I've never even seen this
technique before he started by
separating out the front and doing the
usual foils and then because my roots
were really bad they're incredible now
he also painted on a different color
like a slightly more natural color onto
my roots around the back basically every
bit of hair was colored and then even
the bits that were between the foils he
put in a more platinum blonde on those
bits almost a bit of an ombre kind of
look so whatever he did it worked
perfectly he did say that because it's
quite a lot of color on there I need to
be really careful about what products I
use and definitely do more deep
conditioning which I have done normally
I'm pretty good at keeping it in good
condition so hopefully it will stay nice
and shiny I also met Claudia from chaco
PR for breakfast yesterday morning and
she gave me a product called olaplex
which is meant to be incredible for kind
of building up the structure of the hair
I'm gonna try that out tonight I'll let
you know how I get on this morning I'm
about to head out to Green Park firstly
to meet a guy at carrot which is a
lovely jewellery company this bracelet
here is from carrot and I'm doing a
little bit of work with them in the
first weeks I'm going to stock up on
some lovely pieces and then I'm heading
it to the grow cylon in Hampstead um and
I'm doing a shoot with look fantastic
and read ken today which should be
really good fun so I'm definitely gonna
bring you along with me I've also got
this little man room
I've also got Dexter coming with me
today because chai is out at work so it
should be a really fun day
I've just got to grow in Hampstead had
my mink of done looking all glamorous
and yeah we're just setting up so
National Forum on don't say basically
when you look fantastic on that can and
we're going to be shooting tutorials
that kind of thing called that website
I'm noting these bold routers and I only
do this both myself but yes their hair
makeup makeup is done I as include
earlier hot spring Jack's to at least
he's just wandering around everybody's
giving him lots of kisses and we've
already done a few few test shots with
him already the star of the show so I
think the first look we're going to do
is a nice curly blow-dried so
so we've just finished filming the first
look which is these ginormous curls
which I'm a little bit in love with and
we used a few lovely red CEM products I
think the first one we use our system
which is windblown over five and they
just put a little bit that on my roots
just to get rid of please and add a
little bit volume which has done the
trick as you can see and then before we
take the curling of the curling tongs we
use this one which is the iron shape
number another and bit of heat
protection also keeps the curls in for
ages and then lastly my favorite which
you guys know I put in some of the
diamond oil just on the m15 and make my
hair look lovely and healthy this is the
first look I don't want to take it out
but we've got two more looks to do up
next texture is being very good in the
few bars
so we've just finished doing the last
look which is this fishtail double
fishtail braid I've got one on its own
and one going down here looks amazing
Dexter once again stealing this show has
been going into photos with me let me
show you some of the pictures with the
little man in it here he is
Dexter stealing the show doesn't he look
handsome even that's what my hair looks
like back
so I've just got back home my camera
decided to die when I was about to leave
so back home now and I'm going to give
myself a little bit of a pamper I'm
gonna thoroughly remove all my makeup as
much as I love it
I'm gonna do a nice double cleanse and
then try out this early Plex which I was
given yesterday to try out and it's a
pre-shampoo treatment but you have to
apply it onto wet hair so I think I'm
just going to take out my lover your
fishtail braid stick a load of this on
my hair and then get to do something
work while it settles in it's certainly
run for 10 minutes or more so I'm pretty
gonna leave on for an hour or so before
having a proper shower later so let's
see how this is if it's as amazing as
everybody says
oops-a-daisy my camera battery died
again yes I have got stuff all over my
face i plastered on the origins drink up
mask because the lovely makeup artists
today so that my skin was a little bit
dry so i slather that on about half an
hour ago and as you can see my skin has
pretty much drunk up all of it so we're
gonna have nice hydrated skin ready for
Fashion Week hopefully and
so my camera died when I was wetting my
hair I think so basically I completely
wet my hair just in the sink using a
hairbrush and then I put maybe two big
dollop fulls of olaplex onto my hair and
it kind of acted like a deep conditioner
like it just made it really easy to comb
through and I just brushed it all
through the length and then I tied it up
into this bun which is where right now
so yeah I did that about half an hour
ago my hair feels pretty dry a little
bit crispy a little bit foggy in the bun
but yeah I'm just cracking on with some
work on my laptop there Charlie's just
gone to Sainsbury's to get me some soup
bless him and yeah that's the update
really I'm gonna get on with some work
now and you know what I might actually
end this look here because I'm basically
gonna be working and eating and then
going to bed so nothing too exciting to
report its but yeah they've been really
good fun with grow and fantastic and red
cones that's been a good pun day
hopefully been fun to watch keep an eye
on my snapchat if you want to know how I
get on with olaplex
