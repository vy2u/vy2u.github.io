much for joining me for today's video so
earlier this week I was on Oxford Street
and I popped into the H&amp;amp;M store not
expecting to find the most incredible
area filled with possibly the most
beautiful of beach products I have seen
in a long time I'm sorry by the way if
you can hear some crackling because
little boy has decided that he really
likes to chew the packaging for the new
products and so if you can then let him
go so sorry if you can hear some
crackling going on in the background but
we're just gonna let him carry on
showing because stop some from climbing
all over me
but anyway so hmm have recently
relaunched their beauty range and the
products are just really gorgeous and I
couldn't resist them and purely for the
packaging sake but I thought I would
also buy a few I got a little bit spendy
and go through the menu to let you know
what I thought of them so hmm did have
beauty products before but I never
really fancy trying them and I think the
only thing that I never tried before
whilst they're clear eyebrow gel and
that's purely because it was I'm sorry
for like keeps changing by the way it's
one of those weird really cloudy then
really sunny days so I've got the light
on but you know can't really it's all
for sunlight issue but anyway so it only
ever tried their Kier I browse gel
before and purely because it was a bit
of a dupe for the benefit brow gel and I
think it was about $2.99 so I'd used
that before but the packaging never
really appealed to me and I just didn't
really fancy H&amp;amp;M Beauty I don't know why
I didn't got something just being a
little bit judgmental but never really
appealed to me before long story short
so then when I saw the packaging for the
new products and the fact that they
relaunched it and I've been really
liking H&amp;amp;M fashion and home I recently I
thought I absolutely have to give this a
go and the store itself looked
absolutely stunning it was on the ground
floor of the Oxford Circus store and I'm
sure a few of the other stores have got
it as well
there was this whole concession it
looked like a Sephora or something there
was a beautiful mirrors of the
spotlights around them one of those like
directed chairs said hmm peachy on it
and I really really wanted one of those
chairs but obviously they weren't for
sale and the whole of presentation of
the beauty just looked absolutely
gorgeous so let's have a little look
inside the bag at some of the pieces
which I bought it okay so these two
beautiful items are both blushes we have
a cream blusher and a powder blusher and
you guys can probably predict but next
time know we don't use eyeshadow he's in
a really naughty mood today I'm Keeley
topoi so back to the blushes these two I
bought them mostly because they're
absolutely beautiful and packaging it
themselves it's this gorgeous hexagon
shape with a gold outline when you look
texture no boy I'm just gonna get him a
toy or something what can I give you to
shred so the first two things I picked
up are these two blushes we've got a
cream blusher and a powder blusher and
both of them I'm not going to lie to you
I picked up because of the packaging
from the outside they're a little bit I
mean they're quite plasticky obviously a
little bit cheap looking but when you
open them up that is when these guys get
really really beautiful so it's the
gorgeous hexagon shape with a gold
outline from the gold base and the same
with this one it's got the black
hexagons and you can see the gold
outline here from the gold base I think
it's a little bit of a shame that these
don't have mirrors and the lids but I
guess that would just add to the price a
little bit the colors which I picked up
are both quite autumnal we've got some
we've got some brownie Pink's this one
is the cream blush which I tried a
little bit on my cheeks earlier and it
did give a really nice consistency not
as intense color as a few other cream
blushes which I tried but I did find
that it wasn't greasy at all which is
fantastic for the budget blusher and it
gave a really good color payoff the deep
brown powder blush I haven't actually
tried yet but I think this is going to
be a gorgeous shade for autumn so I'll
probably do a little tutorial or blog
post about this so you can see how it
looks in real life
next in the bag is a few of their powder
eyeshadows I am unashamedly a brown
eyeshadow girl I know it's kind of
boring but I just absolutely love them
and hmm had such an incredible range of
Browns and neutral eyeshadows as well as
loads of colors as well so I picked up
three different rounds the first one is
the lightest and this is called candied
almond and I think this is probably
going to be my everyday brown eyeshadow
because it's
quite they're very soft light brown
shade that gives a really good color
payoff so especially for like the
creases I definitely think I'm using
this one a lot in the coming months and
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna pronounce as
wrong but this one is the shade mo J's
Mojave mojo Bay I don't know MOJ a EE
and it's basically quite a light brown
almost with a pinky tint to it and it's
got a little bit of shimmer I think this
will be really nice on those days when I
want to have something a little bit more
interesting on my eyelids and then
finally this one is called shiitake
which back her when she picked it up put
it into shittake which this is gonna
make me feel of every time I opened this
eyeshadow but again it's it actually
reminds me of one of the shades from The
Naked 3 palette and it's a very not sure
how you describe this it's quite a
golden brown but again I think it's
going to be really lovely for building
up the smoky eye in the autumn months
and even though I didn't need any more I
shadows I just have so many eyeshadows
and especially brown eyeshadows I also
picked up one of their smokey eye
palettes so this is the eye color
palette in smoking news and it just has
the most incredible selection of brown
eyeshadows this one does have a lid in
the mirror and it was $9.99 so probably
the most expensive out of all the bits
that I bought but I think it's
incredible value still so you've got
nine different eyeshadow shades ranging
from this really light one which would
be great for the brow bone and then
you've got some deeper shades that
should be great for filling in the
crease or even maybe using with a thin
brush for a liner and then some really
lovely shimmery and matte light brown
colors so assume this is an incredibly
usable palette and the packaging again
really beautiful really chic and this
really reminds me as do the where are
they after the blood shows really
reminds me of Tom Ford packaging I just
think it looks very expensive even
though it kind of feels cheap it looks
expensive looks really chic and I'm
gonna absolutely love having this up on
my makeup table next thing in my bag is
the cashmere haze body wash gentle
cleanser with jasmine flower extract
says gentle cleanser but this is a body
wash so don't go putting this on your
face I am slightly undecided as to
whether I like the smell of this or not
I thought a jasmine smell would be a
little bit more sweet and floral but
this is quite am I want to say musky but
I don't think that's the right word to
describe it but basically
it looks prettier than it is if that
makes sense I really wanted to love this
I love the sound of it
cashmere he's body wash I'm just not
blown away by the scent of this it might
be a personal thing so definitely just
go into the store and give them a smell
because they are stunning and I'm just
gonna see how much this was I'm sure it
wasn't too much I think it might have
been 799 but I can't tell from the
receipt which one it was but if it was
$7.99 then I wouldn't really say it's
worth it I think for that price you can
get a lot more luxurious body washes but
maybe it's cheaper maybe I'm wrong so
definitely check this out in the store
okay I've just seen on the bottom the
loots $2.99 in which case you can't
really go wrong for $2.99 for body
washes so sorry hmm
so I went a little bit crazy when it
came to nail varnishes and I kicked up
for none of which I needed because I'm
pretty sure that I have very similar
shapes to all of these but they looked
absolutely stunning they had a fantastic
range loads of really great trend colors
lots of all of you Browns and news for
autumn and also some very pretty and
very wearable Pink's so I picked up four
starting with that see words that say
the name this one is yannick dear Liana
Kadir I'm guessing they're all kind of
Swedish names but this is a very kind of
candy pink color this is a type of
shader which I absolutely love to wear
throughout spring so this will be going
to the back of my drawer and definitely
coming out in the springtime okay this
one says Yannick appear as well so I'm
thinking that's maybe the Swedish word
for Nelvana to something but the
previous one I mentioned was shade one
one one five zero and this one the
brownie one is shaped 501 this is the
color that I'm wearing right now and I
think this is a really lovely wonderful
autumn because it's very neutral but
it's still quite fashionable if that
makes sense I just absolutely love
having Brown on my nails I think it goes
and loads of outfits so this is going to
be one of my most worn of the selection
I think then we have one one 197 nice
catchy name and this is more of a dirty
paper I'd say this as a kind of murky
past
almost a gray pinks I think this is
going going to really lovely in the
springtime but maybe forgets a little
bit more more of a late summer than I
might bring this one out a little bit
earlier and then finally 1 4 5 4 7 I've
just realized it says utopia on the back
so maybe they all have names I'm sorry
guys I should've check this first yeah
okay so this one is utopia this one this
the third one I mentioned is CPR second
one I mentioned is nutmeg and the first
one I mentioned is starfish so not one
one one five seven or whatever so sorry
guys I should have but so the final one
is an almost olivey green but with a
little bit more gray in it and I think
this is going to be a gorgeous color for
autumn and really really pretty shade
and very unusual I'm sure she'll now
have something quite similar to this but
I've not seen anything else like this on
the high street and I'm sure you were
all 399 let me just check that yeah I
think they were all 399 so that's
cheaper than pretty sure that's around
the same prices like barium and even
better shade range in my opinion so
definitely check out the HTM nail
varnishes then I picked up a color
essence eye cream and as I mentioned in
my video which I've filmed with Sabrina
which you guys all have seen last week I
picked this up because I kind of was
hoping it would be a dupe of the
Charlotte Tilbury eye cream and I have
tried this and compared the two and I
have to say the Charlotte Tilbury it is
better it does look more expensive when
it's on but this applies beautifully
it's a gorgeous color and I think if you
don't have Charlotte Tilbury budget this
is an amazing alternative I really
really love this stuff
I've been using it I've actually been
dotting on my cheeks for highlighter
which I know is not fits menus but it
looks lovely for that reason if you
blend in with a brush but it's also
gorgeous on the eyelid so I'm not sure
if you can see here but it's a very
pinky gold color and that's the kind of
thing that I really love in the evenings
especially when it comes to things like
New Year's parties or Christmas parties
I think this will be great for using as
a base to have a creamy base before you
build up a nice shimmering smoky eye so
highly recommend hmm I creams I also
picked up one of their perfection is to
finish
powders I was really impressed that they
had five shades of these I think the
normal budget highlighters or powder
sorry they only normally have about
three shades so the fact they had five I
thought was really good and I've only
swatched this I'm not putting on my face
yet but I mean it feels good I'm not
sure it's the best power-law I think the
powders you really do get what you pay
for but I'm not going to wipe this one
off or strike it off yours expression
I'm not gonna disregard this that's not
what I'm looking for but we'll go with
that nothing to disregard this and so
I've tried it on my face I'm just not
you know not I'm really struggling with
words today I'm not convinced by the
swatch that I've done on the back of my
hand it feels a little bit drying and I
like to have a bit of a go even wanted
to use powder so check out the blog post
because I am going to try all of this
stuff before this video goes live and
I'm gonna write a review on the blog so
I'll link that down below because
hopefully the blog and the video go
light on the same day so you can see
what I thought this on my face and then
finally I got some lip products so
firstly we've got a couple of lipsticks
I picked up peach fuzz which is a lovely
light pink color I thought this is quite
a neutral pink and it's just the kind of
shade that I wear as an everyday color
with a nice lip liner I think this'll
look gorgeous
I didn't see any lip liners in the store
but maybe I missed them so I'm pretty
gonna go back and double-checks I think
this would look lovely with a lip liner
and then this one's called Kombucha with
a k and again that just packaging is
really beautiful we've got the white and
the gold I think this whole collection
probably will sell a million times
better because it looks so stunning
but this lipstick is no exception and
it's almost I'd say it is a coral but a
nice curl for transitioning into autumns
it has got a little bit of Brown about
it and I really like the shape of the
bullet as well it's got quite a precise
point so I think it'd be nice to draw
quite a defined lip so you don't need
liner if you don't want to but I've been
loving a lip liner recently so I
definitely think I'll be trying these
with a lip liner and last but not least
and this is the one
I think I'm most excited about and I'm
wearing it today it's the lush lip vinyl
and I've got the shade chick chopped no
she croc that's been tongue twister chic
rock chick a truck chic chalk hunts
really strange chic chop and I picked
this up because I thought it'd be a jeep
for the Sephora matte lip blusters if
that's what they're called which last
winter after I got back from New York I
wore the fig shade all the time and this
I thought looked very similar and color
wise it's very similar the way that it
applies it's just as lovely but it's got
a bit more shine than me and Sephora
ones so I do really like a matte lip
especially what are you doing in autumn
I really like to have a matte lip but if
you really love this color and you want
something with a little bit of shine to
it then this is absolutely gorgeous
again stunning packaging and the
applicator I found really easy to use
it's quite precise got quite a shop nib
to it so again really easy to apply on
the go I just found one more things that
wasn't the last I also got a get a grip
dry hairspray I just thought this is a
fantastic Homburg sized hairspray again
and really sorry I haven't actually
tried this yet so I can't tell you
whether it's good or not but yeah as I
said check the blog post down below plug
plug plug um but yeah I always think
that have my size dry shampoo are
amazing because I think that's when you
really need them is when you're out and
about so if this can be due for the
batiste ones and let's see how much it
was
I think $2.99 everyday seasonal oh yeah
it has it on the bottle to 90 nights
this is a really good price for a mini
dry shampoo perfect size of the handbag
and yeah I don't think you can go wrong
with dry shampoo so I'm sure it will be
just as good as the usual brands again
yeah check the vlog and I'll let you
guys know so that's everything that's
all the bits that I picked up in my hmm
haul I think overall I'm so impressed by
this range I'm so glad that H&amp;amp;M bore
this out I think it's about time of
budget brand bought out and absolutely
beautiful range why we all love to
Instagram our beauty products or at
least I do so htm' you've done a really
good job of creating a stunning
collection everything was around the 5
pound marks and things to 99s and then
at $7.99 $9.99 but all incredibly
affordable a lot of shots to how much
still came to because as you can see
ended by quite a lot so as long as Gary
how much I spent but you guys don't have
to go anywhere near as crazy as I did
just pick up the pieces that you needed
I think over all the things so far I'm
most impressed with are the eyeshadows
the thing that absolutely stunning I
think if you're going to buy one thing
the eyeshadow palette is big one I think
that is just such incredible value so
definitely check the range out if you
are near an H&amp;amp;M store not sure that's
available online but I'm sure it will
get there and yeah as I said check out
my blog post for more pictures swatches
and some more therapies so thank you
guys so much for watching I really hope
you've enjoyed this video and I will see
you in my next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
