two of fashion mumbler hall week so this
week I'm posting a whole video every
single day because because I like
shopping and I think sharing it with you
guys so all of these shopping splurges
have happened over the past couple of
weeks and this particular bag of bits
and bobs from H&amp;amp;M home has been sitting
at the side of my bed just waiting for
me to film this video for a good week or
so now so I thought I would share with
you all the bits and pieces that I
recently picked up just to spruce up the
house a little bit from H&amp;amp;M home
personally I absolutely love hmmm home
for their design I find them really
beautiful aesthetically compared to the
price I think the most similar on the
high street we Zara home but Zara home
is just that tiny bit more expensive hmm
almost know the vibe that I'm going for
within my own home sometimes before I
even know so it goes without saying that
I often get a little bit spendy
especially when I go to store on Oxford
Street I'm gonna have to film the first
few products with this little chap on my
lap because he's being very very needy
this afternoon aren't you Dexter keeps
crying in the background so apologies if
you already heard it so the first thing
that I picked up are these cushions I
picked up to cushion covers the internal
bits I already had at home on some
actually old H&amp;amp;M cushions as well both
of which look really really gorgeous on
my bed I have a white throw on the bed
so these cushions really add a beautiful
metallic touch to the bedroom I think
that cushions are by far the easiest way
to add a bit of color or a little bit of
design detail to an otherwise plain then
so I picked up two of those and as you
can probably imagine you'll be seeing a
lot of these in my video backgrounds
when I start filming upstairs again so
in beauty tutorials you'll be seeing
these in the background but how must I
do which way around I'm gonna put them
yet
maybe I'll just switch it up every now
and then because both sides are
absolutely gorgeous a few of the next
bits and pieces are all in this basket
so I'll start making my way through
what's inside first of all there are a
couple of hand towels and glass the hand
our house at the moment I really mix and
match so none of them really go with
each other they're kind of ones we
picked up over the past couple of years
so I decided to find the invest in some
proper matching ones so if you can hear
Dexter Wang in the background I really
don't know what is wrong with in this
morning he's looking so sad but these
are plain whites but they've got this
diamond embroidered detail in a beige
thread and then these tassels along the
bottom and our bathroom color scheme is
we white sand sandy color so these will
go perfectly it's got one for the
upstairs bathroom and one for the
downstairs cloakroom oh and the third
for the ensuite as well so we're all
decked out in your hand colors next to
my basket is three sets of napkins or
are three sets of napkins the first ones
say there is always time chocalate and
these ones just have little gold panels
on them and the final set say great
things will be served these are all
$1.99 each which as far as napkins go is
pretty darn good
I think the designs are just really fun
and quirky Charlie and I often have
barbecues or summer dinner parties so I
thought this would just be a really nice
addition to our table then I have a
another cushion color this one is plain
white but it has almost like a rose
design in 3d fabric hopefully you can
pick that up from the camera this I
thought would go really nicely online
and Charlie's bed which is a different
beds the one that we film in at the
moment we've got quite plain cushions on
there but I thought this is really
lovely and feminine but without being
too girly for Charlie to sleep in there
again I thought this looked far more
expensive and it's $7.99 price tag so I
picked up two of the rosy ones and then
also this one which is a gold I don't
know what you described this that was
like a star pattern that was almost like
an Indian snowflake but I thought the
two floral ones with this golden in the
middle would be a really lovely cushion
cluster for my choice bedroom all of
those bits and bobs I'd stored them in
this gold basket
actually decided what I'm gonna keep
from this basket yet but I think it was
like $6.99 a little bit more $14.99 I
just saw this would come in really handy
as I said I'm not really sure for what
yet but storage in this house always
comes in useful
I might even use it downstairs as a
magazine rack you'll definitely be able
to fit magazines and books in here in
fact underneath our coffee table is
looking a little bit messy so maybe I'll
transfer a few things to this but to be
honest for the home we're slightly
moving away from rose gold and more
towards a yellowy gold of which hmm have
loads in at the moment so this was a
really good starting block for adding a
little bit of yellowy gold into our
lounge then moving into the bag
everything in here is wrapped up so I'm
guessing it's a few candles really
remember since home last week this one
is a very plain kind of classic design
and it's called cotton I really like
just how this one looks in the plain
clear jar with this very handmade style
rustic label which just says scented wax
candle 3% aroma selection dates original
batch so it's meant to look really
rustic smell wise this one actually
wasn't my favorite but I think it's
something for now the home says bathroom
and then the jar will come in really
handy afterwards I'll probably keep that
cotton balls or on cotton buds inside it
just really useful storage after the
candle has all burnt out but I do find a
genetic candles do have a very strong
scent so once it's lit it really will
keep the whole rooms nice really lovely
this next candle is the same kind of
style but instead it's black glass and
this the one I absolutely love the scent
it's called mahogany and I'd say that if
you share a house with guys or you live
with your boyfriend or husband then this
is a really good unisex scent it
actually kind of reminds me of a Tom
Ford fragrance which is amazing
considering this was $12.99 it
definitely smells like it could be a Tom
Ford candle or aqua de Parma definitely
something far more expensive than a
$12.99 H&amp;amp;M candle so yeah this one is
called mahogany and is even more unisex
in it
this black glass pot so this one will
probably live in either our bedroom or
the lounge then we have another one you
can tell I really like this style of
candle this one is a green tea and
bergamot and again a really really
lovely smell smells a lot more expensive
and H&amp;amp;M candle and as I said before they
really do blast out the room with
fragrance this one I think is more
suitable for downstairs I'm sure this
one will be the one we keep in the
lounge again really rustic with the
orange glass and the same kind of
homemade recycled type label on that
then I picked up this little bowl I just
thought it was so adorable again not
sure what I'm gonna use it for maybe if
your trinkets maybe from the kitchen but
whenever Charlie and I have barbecues or
dinner parties these types of Bowl
always come in really handy whether
that's for peanuts pistachios or pesto
always really really handy and this one
is a beautiful kind of cream color
creamy ivory color with gold teardrop
dots all the way around and a gold rim
around there as well so really beautiful
coverings our kitchen crockery is really
mix-and-match just anything pretty goes
in our kitchen so this will be a really
lovely addition and finally I picked up
this jug so this is a glass joke with I
really shouldn't know what this design
is because it's everywhere at the moment
you see this in Zara you see this in
like Selfridges you even sometimes see
in Tesco and Sainsbury's if you're
really lucky this it's like an oval with
a family crest design inside it if
anyone knows that the name is please let
me know because I'm always talking about
this design but it's a beautiful almost
an art deco style jug with the gold
paint along the top goes really nicely
with our other crockery we have this
design in plain little water glasses and
also wine glasses as well I think I
actually did a ginormous hmm Hall where
I showed you unboxing
a little while ago so if I can find it
I'll link that down below that was a
huge hole and so yeah this was the last
piece that I picked up this will come in
really handy for anymore summer BBQs
making pins or I don't know an elf elf
is this is a really beautiful way of
serving a cocktail or two so that's
everything that I picked out from H&amp;amp;M
home not the world's biggest haul but
all of these little things make such a
big difference to the home especially
the cushions it's such an inexpensive
way to really add a lift to a room we
had so many nice designs and try to
think of the others if you're into that
really retro la inspired palm print
they have bedding they had cushions they
even had for the kitchen they had more
slate design so gold is not your thing
you're more rustic even they had lots of
really cool slate but yeah hmm is such a
great place for very affordable ways to
update your home so I hope you enjoyed
looking through the bits and bobs that I
picked up in my recent haul check back
again tomorrow for a fashion haul it's
going to be a sloth tomorrow so make
sure you are subscribed if you don't
want to miss any of my hauls and if you
enjoyed this one then please give this
video a thumbs up and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
