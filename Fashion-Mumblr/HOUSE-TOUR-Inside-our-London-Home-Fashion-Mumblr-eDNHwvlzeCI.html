come on in
and welcome to a house tour video long
owed you this is a humble home where
Charlie Dexter and Dickens and I live
Charlie now moved in just under six
years ago sort of Olympic just after the
Olympics yep and it's a very cozy home
it's not a showroom by any means very
well lived in as you will see Jesse
moved in with me when I was living with
friends mm-hmm and that was carnage he
was six of his guys I think yeah on
Clapham High Street and then we had the
opportunity to move here which was
fantastic it's taken us what probably
like two or three or six years to get
everything in order
yeah over over the time we've lived here
we have so but surely upgraded some of
the furniture some of it is still the
same things that we actually eat around
painted yeah a lot of the things we got
from charity shops and we painted them
up when we moved in and then a few
things are newer but I will show you all
of that as we go around so without
further ado let's go so we're starting
off in in the living room this is
probably where we spend 90% of our time
on the sleeping and we've got our
television a couple of sofas sofa bed as
well although this is also the dogs
bedroom so people don't often sleep down
here one of my favorite parts of the
room is this marble table which comes in
very handy for were shooting blog photos
we love to have candles lit in the house
as well so we've got quite a lot of
candles ranging from this ginormous one
which I think was from Anthropologie I
think I bought this back from the US and
then a couple of small ones charlie
particularly loves this very snazzy Tom
Dixon one I've got a couple of real
flowers and a couple of these like
everlasting flowers we absolutely love
these these are from grace flower box
we've got pink wines and then we also
have some white ones over in the corner
as you may be able to see we still have
some cards up a lot of these are
engagement cards we got engaged for five
months ago in our bus you know you wanna
get engaged once so we're keeping the
cards up we also have mine and Charlie's
Valentine's Day cards we just have this
way tradition where we keep them up hold
which is kind of strange this fireplace
is I think really really beautiful and
this was here when we moved in we didn't
really need to do too much like
structurally to the house when we moved
in so that's a nice feature we always
have some nice candles above there and
then we've got lamps bookshelves and oh
my gosh let me show you this little guy
so this is mr. no he doesn't really have
a name I feel like Norbert Norbert
sakata now he does this always reminds
me of when I used to work at mulberry
because the first fashion show I did
when we worked there was known themed or
technically English country garden and
the whole of Claridge's was filled with
gnomes so we were able to take one of
them home after the show so Norbit now
lives in our lounge and he's kind of
creepy but kind of cute so we just we
just leave him in the corner we have a
couple of bookshelves either side of the
television and these have got things
like photos more cards we've got
Charlie's huge DVD collection and purees
also a couple of vlogger Awards couple
of James J Awards just generally most
surfaces in this house are just kind of
filled with really personal things we
don't like to over style anything it's
all very very lived in and then we just
got radio a couple of I guess you cause
in the nest of tables you're not gonna
lie we eat our dinner off these
regularly this side is probably a little
bit prettier bookshelf wise and we've
got a few more like memory things on
here I've got my dissertation which is
this ginormous bad boy here we've got
some pictures from the holiday where
Charlie and I met which is actually
covered by our Alexa how times change so
no Charlie's a big tech nerd so we have
quite a lot of cool technology in the
house we both love the Alexa the some of
us we've got obviously a Reese now ZTV
and then we have some sambar in there
which is this is where all the bar
electronics are because I don't like to
see them so they get hidden away in
there I've got quite a lot of fashion
books up on the shelves as well a few of
the books which I have collected over
the years and I thought I would try to
style them and not so that all in one
rose
got some of them which are like on their
side some of them I like to show cover
of including this lovely sausage dog
book and then just general things like
candles and cactuses on the shelves over
there down here next to little Dicky on
the floor we've got our dough so I think
it's called an airflow and another bit
of snazzy technology in the house
this not only heats and cools but also
purifies the air which is wonderful so
around here this is our main lounging
sofa up here is Dexter in Dickens
favorite place to lie because they can
see Charlie and I when were working they
can see some are relaxing and they can
also keep an eye on their garden so this
is their favorite place to sleep over
here we have a art picture wall are you
really a blogger if you don't have a
decennial wall in your house and then
I've got a few family photos and we have
a lot of sausage dog mementos in the
house including this rather handsome
chap this is our dining table and this
is one of the pieces that we bought back
in Gloucester and painted ourselves I
feel like this is the kind of thing that
in a shabby-chic shop in London you
could spend over a thousand pounds on we
got the table and six chairs for under
hundred pounds so great painted it up
with some nice parabola missile paint
and it's a great table for eating and
also working so this is our office got
my laptop I'm not going to lie this
tables normally covered in papers and
files and books and things like that
these are just gorgeous
I had these at a shoot yesterday and it
makes me very happy to have lots now is
everywhere so a blogger events I have
this little tactic where I hang around
until the end of an event and often they
say we can take the flowers so that's a
bonus and yeah that's our that's our
dining table
this here is Dexter in Dickens bed
number one they have known
less than four beds in this room it's
definitely their house as much as it is
ours but let me now show you through to
the kitchen so this is our kitchen it's
nice and brightest at the front of the
house again we've not redone much of
this room since we moved in we have got
another lovely farmhouse style table
I wanted it to still feel very
countryside ish despite the fact that we
live pretty much in central London a lot
of the things in this house don't match
either so as you can see we have loads
of random chairs which we've also
painted ourselves kitchen wise most of
our appliances are hidden very boring
don't you see them my favourite plants
however is my Thermomix which I talk
about a lot is the best gadget over here
is Charlie's favorite area this is a
coffee area we've got an espresso
machine this is where we keep our
capsules and then the milk frother
biscuits very well used all of our bits
and bobs in the cupboards microwave sink
again it's quite higgledy-piggledy we
don't have like matching mugs
everything is just totally you know well
you spoil of we've got some nice little
em'ly bridgewater pots which are lovely
and then our utensil area sink copper
pans we have a few cookbooks up on the
walls some of our favorites include the
tongue carriage one I also really love
Madeleine shores cookbooks this we
actually picked up on Charlie nice first
UK break together we went to beckons
field to celebrate I think five months
anniversary and we picked this up in a
shop there
so that's fits that wall absolutely
perfectly another thing that I love in
this room is our hand soap this is the
reverence ESOP one it has a little
ground
so when you wash your hands universal
exfoliating treat so that's uh that's
that let me now show you up says this is
our downstairs bathroom it's very small
not much to show you there and then we
head upstairs mind out for a little
hound oh this is our stair gate it's
actually a garden center chicane it's
not very big but it's enough to stop
sausage dogs going up the stairs so
let's go up as you come up the stairs
this is the first ring that you come to
it is our second bedroom we used to have
a double bed in here and we used to rent
this room out by a spare room we've
lived with a couple of couples but now
it's just Charlie nine the dogs living
here we do still have this box bed in
the room it actually I can show you very
cleverly Springs open to reveal a single
bed inside that comes in very handy if
we have anyone staying this is also the
room that I do my filming in you might
recognize this little setup behind me
and then around this side we have a
couple of wardrobes as you probably know
the room next door has been converted to
a walk-in wardrobe so we moved the
wardrobes into this room planning on
putting one of them on gumtree but at
the moment they're kind of filled with a
lot of my beauty products and clothes I
need to sort through so I'm not going to
show you inside because they are
overflowing on this rail behind me is
where I tend to put the clothes that I
have just recently bought and I want to
think about whether I'm going to keep
them or not how I'm gonna style them so
this is a lot of my new in and the same
with shoes I have this lovely mirror as
well which again is a great prop for
filming and for showing my outfit of the
days in vlogs then I've got my everyday
handbag down there this is again
something I use for filming it's a
lovely little loved hub seat from all of
the bonus' and then on the window sill I
have got a few pretty things cacti sand
fake hydrangeas some nice smelly Ted
Baker candles and diffusers and then
this is where I keep some of my jewelry
and then in this corner we have this
nice shelving unit and I tried to style
this up to look pretty we've got a few
bags on here some of my favorite
perfumes and then sometimes we blog a
mail you get certainly gorgeous boxes
which I just comfort in the bin so I
have a few of my favorites like Joe
alone Tom Ford Aaron as well some more
perfumes and then don't look down the
bottom because that's where I keep my
wires and my trouble makeup bags and
things like that and then this here is
my makeup storage / dressing table I
usually put the lights on on the mirror
and I find that it's really good
lighting for doing my makeup on the top
here this little box if you will is a
collection of beauty products I'm
currently testing out so if I want to
keep things out and trial them for a
little bit I'll put them in that box
then we've got my makeup brushes this
little Muji stacking system is where I
keep the majority of my makeup I have
done a makeup storage and clear out
video quite recently so I'll leave that
one link down below if you'd like to
explore my makeup area a little bit more
these are my most used everyday perfumes
on the top here and then also my makeup
brushes this whole thing is pretty much
filled with beauty products and hair
products and things like that whereas
this is more of a paper and like a bill
version of a mandrel so yeah I'm going
to show you and that it's very very
boring so that's it for this room let me
show you our walk-in wardrobe this is
our walking wardrobe room which you guys
have seen many times before here on the
channel I will leave my latest wardrobe
tour video links down below and up on
the screen as well so you can see it in
more detail but basically we used to
have this as a spare bedroom it's a very
small room and we decided that it would
be far more useful and lovely as a
walking wardrobe to help with our
storage solutions this side is my side I
have all of my clothes in here
shoes clothes coats bags etc etc and
then I really love this window see area
it's just a very nice feature of the
room and on this side is Charlie's side
we have mirrored section and he has all
of his blazers his many many roll necks
and pairs of Chelsea boots are all
tucked away in there and then if I flip
you around I can show you
the shelving unit as well and then this
is where I just stole my prettier things
bits and bobs that I don't want to get
tucked away so we've got some of my
favorite pairs of shoes some of my
prettiest handbags and then perfumes and
things like read diffusers and general
pretty things and then down on the
bottom again we have the messy area
which is where I keep my hair bits and
bobs so that is the walk-in wardrobe
room at the end of the corridor we have
got our guest bathroom so China I do
have an ensuite in our bedroom but this
is the spare bathroom
Charlie tends to use this most of the
time he has all of his manly cosmetics
in the cabinet above the sink which
Charlie actually broke by dropping and
this is such a fiscal problem charlie
drops a big limb and moisturizer on the
sink cracked it I was not impressed we
do have this lovely Victorian comfort
style bath which I love so this is
Charlie's cabinets a few of his products
you saw heels I think this is the
moisturizer that he dropped on the sink
and yeah that's all of his cosmetics in
there so last but not least this is our
boudoir
this is managed house bedroom our bed is
probably one of my favorite pieces of
furniture in the house we got this from
it was called the French furniture
company and we got it as we moved into
the house we absolutely love it it's
quite big for this room but yeah big fan
of that's and there we have a lot of the
furniture in this house is matching I
think is the company called
Signature Collection or something along
those lines I'll leave as much as
possible that I've mentioned it links
down below but the chest of drawers you
may remember match the furniture you saw
in the second bedroom and then we also
have the unit's that you'll see in a
second facing the bed which is from the
same company this little thing over here
is something that I now absolutely rely
on it's a clock which is not very
attractive but it projects the time on
the ceiling and I find that so useful if
you wake up in the middle of the night
you don't need to check your phone or
anything you just look up and it tells
you what time it is so absolutely love
that Charlie's Joe enormous selection
and fragrances on his bedside table and
then we have these really nice lamps
I'm trying to run where we got them from
I'm not sure but I find out and leave
them linked below again we have a couple
of candles this Elemis one is a real
favorite it's one of their life elixirs
it's quite a masculine scent as well we
have a lot of unisex kind of candles in
here and then I'll show you around to my
side of the boudoir this is my bedside
table I just have my evening skin care
products on here I have even more
products in my bedside drawer same lamp
a little bit of jewelry I puts my
jewelry that I wear kind of every day
that I take off before bed goes on there
some fake flowers we have such a mix of
fake and real flowers in the house and
then our bedding we have a lot of
different sets from the white company
these are also from the white company
these big pillows we didn't want to put
too many pillows on because who can be
bothered to make their bed every morning
with millions of pillows but these are
the ones that we have charlie night are
both quite OCD when it comes to making
the bed and making it look the same way
in fact once we had a couple living here
and we found out that well that while we
would go away at the weekends they would
come and sleep in our bed and the way
that we found out was because they would
leave the cushions a different way to
how we used to leave them so that was
that was just really really weird and in
this corner we have the chair and I
think that everybody has this chair in
their bedroom it's clothes that are too
clean to go in the washing basket and
too dirty to get put back in the
wardrobe so this is the chair where
miscellaneous clothes get put and then
we have this unit which is again from
that same collection another bit of tech
that I love is a alarm clock I think
this is a philips omnia i think that's
what it's called and this starts glowing
and six o'clock in the morning and it
wakes you up as though it's sun waking
you up and then at 6:30 it starts
playing Alpine noises like cows mooing
and birds chirping and we really really
like it now we have another big TV we do
watch TV maybe most nights before bed we
watch Netflix for like an hour or so and
we're normally fast asleep by 11:00 p.m.
so that's the TV we have a couple of
nice photos of Charlie and I in the room
and then we
in the evenings tend to like candles
most evenings and then we have a couple
of diffusers in the room as well this
one is from neon it's from their Center
to sleep collection it's a really nice
smell for falling asleep too and we also
missed our pillows with a pillow mist
from that same collection as well which
is another thing that Charlie's quite
OCD about doing every single day last
but not least this is our ensuite
bathroom we renovated this bathroom
about a year ago now I really like the
styling here it's still kind of rustic a
little bit shabby chic but a lot nicer
than it was when we first moved in the
sink and the toilet
oh and shower are from a company called
heritage bathrooms and I just think
they're really really lovely this is my
bathroom cabinet this was from John
Lewis and inside I probably should have
prepared that make this really neat but
a real glimpse into my skincare routine
these are the products that I use most
evenings not all of them obviously my
toothbrush toothpaste is so messy I'm
almost embarrassed to show you and then
I've got some nice molten brown things
on the sink some body lotions etc and
then our lovely big shower area as well
one final sausage dog item that our
guests see as they leave the house is
our sausage dog doormat and on that note
I will say farewell thank you for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
