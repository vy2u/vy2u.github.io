today which means the start of every day
May vlogs I was waiting for Charlie's
reaction so at the moment was staying at
my mom's house because we are having our
house renovated and it was meant to be
done when we got back from our us strips
but turns out there's a little bit more
to done and that we thought so with mum
for a couple of days we are heading to
mums spa now we're going to go to gym at
penny Hill and this is going to be the
first time that Charlie and I have
dreamed since before we went to the US
so it's going to be quite a challenge
let's looking forward to burning off
some of those burgers so Oh
so pretty much got gem to ourselves here
penny hey literally me mom's Charlie and
one other lady I'm finding it so much
harder that we call it California I feel
like all those burgers rapidly knocks me
back a few weeks on my gym routine I'm
just doing a little bit of cardio a few
leg ways try and burn some serious
calories get back into the swing of it
and then I think we've got our PT next
week back up version so it'll be really
good at the circus back in shape I'll
show you a few of the exercises I'm
doing I've done 20 minutes on the
treadmill already doing Mike I know
sprints and then I did a circuit of leg
wait the two machines will be doing so
now I see I'm going to head over to the
bleep area and different ways of sports
because I think those really burn and
even if announced much energy I can
normally get quite up those done so
and we just got back from the gym and
I'm going to do my makeup so I thought I
would do it with you guys starting off
with some fps this is the lumia md broad
spectrum SPF 42 so I'm going to apply a
little bit of that as my moisturizer
this is a really nice high SPF so again
for dude like say when it's a little bit
sunnier going to be spending some time
outside and I find this as one of the
best ones as a me as a base split makeup
it sinks in really quickly and it
doesn't leave any whiteness and then
because I didn't really pack terribly
well because of the house being in such
a mess and then mostly pinch mother's
makeup so I'm using her technique beyond
perfecting foundation which I do
actually have at home with love this is
just going to be a 5 minute makeup
routine because we're heading to
Charlie's auntie's house for lunch in
about 10 minutes time so this is my
Skyler eyes are the window palette it's
got loads of Brown neutral shades in it
this is of them I pretty much used every
day while we were traveling in LA Dallas
and New York and just because it's got
date night shades in it pretty much
every shade that I need and it's really
good for an everyday palettes are just
blend a cup of Browns over the limp then
I'm going to use my benefit brow pencils
just as a little bits of shape to the
brow and then some gimme brow just to
finish off the shape and this kind of
set them in place as well pinching mums
bronzer this is the Clarins bronzing and
blush compact I think this is from a new
collection and then as always seen under
my cheekbones
and then up on the forehead to make you
look this up on a little bit of color I
feel like while we were in the u.s. I
lost all my time and so at the moment
I'm using this which is a tester or a
sample of the Charlotte Tilbury
overnight bronze &amp;amp; Glow mask and so far
I've only used it two nights but so far
I am impressed even choice about looking
a bit browner this morning which is good
and then I'm bringing this down on my
neck to try and blend in the colors
because I did fake tan earlier today as
well so just trying to make it seem this
color also going to use mums sirens
cream blush think this is actually
foundation brush but I'm guessing she
uses it for blusher judging by the color
so it's going to put a little bit of
that on the cheeks and then just a lick
of mascara this is the Estee Lauder
sumptuous extreme mascara this is the
one that I used the whole time while
we're away it's the only one I took with
me and and it's really good if you don't
have eyelash colors when you sit still
adds loads of volume okay so that's far
from perfect but mum and Charlie are
ready to go so I'm just gonna with the
blow dryer through my hair get changed
and head out that's literally the most
basic of makeup routines but we've got
time for today right where's the
hairdryer so I have actually forgotten
how good tangle teasers are until I
tried using a mums hairbrush to brush my
hair
I forgot that normal however chances
don't work for me this tangle teezer has
got picture of Dexter on it I'm not sure
if that's something that they offer as a
service now or if that was like a
blogger gift but either way it is
officially my new favorite hairbrush I
also lost my wet brush in the first week
of our US trip so this is the only thing
that I've pretty much used for the past
month
I've only tried my hair like 3/4 but
being shouted out that we've got to go
so it's going to have to do right it's
going to get changed so this is an
example of how not to pack in a rush
because what I've done is I've grabbed
three different clothing items that I
absolutely love but they don't go
together in the slightest
I'm just trying to do it do my blouse up
one handedly so this is my infamous dog
blouse a dupe of the Stella McCartney
one sadly it doesn't have any sausage
dogs on it and then these jeans they
have really nice detail on them these I
actually got from Reese when I swept
their a couple years ago and just always
have really loved the fit
they stayed really nice and then these
shoes are a bit of a dupe for the Chanel
ones except they were only 39 pounds yes
I love everything in the outfit which is
not necessarily all together I'll leave
links to everything down below as always
so yeah we're ready to go look at Louise
bottom finishing touch to the outfit of
the day and lips excuse me probably
around
okie-dokie so in funny in Carl you
Charlie not you know that's why I've
have a catch up with you while I'm not
rushed and
no I think about my vlogs close in Texas
but I'm going to clogging Dallas Texas
and yeah it's going to take a bit of
getting used to blogging everyday again
but I'm Joey doing everyday May last
year and this may I've got quite a lot
of fun things coming up so it's good
time stupid vlogging so we're getting
the house done up which I mentioned
briefly earlier but we have basically
lived in our house for five years coming
up to five years and we've never really
done anything with it it was always in
fine condition it was just time good
nice but we've always wanted to put our
own stamp on it so we kept putting it
off so busy and then finally mom
actually had a brainwave she thought
that she could come over while her in
the mold use and get at home oh yeah the
walrus yes so she came over while we're
homies together yeah sorry
she's lived in the house for a couple
days while we were away for two weeks
hard times and has a different distance
malankov quote
what you do and then while we were away
like us joke that we got back from two
days ago she also went over to over
season starts work so mum has been a bit
of a lifesaver and it really helped us
to get the project off the ground so I
will show you how the house and cooking
and when we get back home this afternoon
they've done a sort of stuff they've
painted the walls they've ripped up the
old carpet and they've started on
ensuite bathrooms but I will blog in the
process and show you the house and it
starts with a lot better
what else you're missin got a couple of
checks coming out I'm going to Monte
Carlo with rewards style and just a
little break and then let's go Monte
Carlo I'm going to Paris with Birchbox
to given you vegetables or some fun
you've got some trouble Patanjali yeah
I'm off to Paris with a trip a couple of
weeks we're smoking I'm being a sick
night cruise with Carl
I don't even ever see
Noah doesn't King Arthur King as again
and I can't remember well Samar is quite
a bit enough that yeah we're going into
Marseille and when you hear no cruisers
which should be good fun so should be
quite fun monster blog and yes I will
share with those troubles with you guys
through daily vlog think I might
intersperse a few sit down e-type videos
as well because it's either a meaningful
films so there's anything that you would
like to see then let me know because
I mean everything in particularly you
like to see because in any development
creation is not demanding video every
single day but yet they are hungry you
Charlie knock me out of a good gym
session in Kenny Hill and you feel like
you've been to California very quiet and
I feel bad I feel a lot better precise I
am looking for to get back up again
because I suck a Wayne yeah we ate
so much in America it's also like the
butter is not desert like butter
everything everything our sugar in as
well yeah I even honestly I'm not joking
so like some of the water we had the
derma tea is really sweet and effective
sugar in it so basically we're going to
have to hard in the gym we're going to
detox and we're going to get back on it
with our personal trainer Adam and I
will share our going back to Barry to
make you young healthy cooking hopefully
webinar kitchen back in order so tonight
we're going to see how minimal our home
is going to be I think it's probably
going to be a case of creeping in these
barracks on I suspect oh she's on yak
about medical the furniture
everything it's going to be very
roughing it for a few days that's the
plan fish gate extra garbage oh yeah
yeah you joke but that would probably be
a good option camping in the garden if
you can ask you exterminated funny vlog
yes camping in our own garden I'm sorry
yeah so probably won't log actually
knocked out because they always kind
looking at how many things communal with
me in two percent and yeah probably see
you guys again like we're driving in
fact London or even home so cleaner okay
we've just got back home after a lovely
afternoon at Charlie's auntie's house we
went for a nice long walk with Dexter
and then we just had a nice lunch sat
outside of the sunshine and we've just
got back home it was just under an
hour's drive which is great new traffic
and we're not too sure where we're going
to sleep tonight because the house is
very much a building site apart from the
kitchen this is our little haven nothing
has really changed in here I'm going to
give you them live around the house to
show you where we are at with the
renovation because when I showed out my
Instagram stories and love you're very
interested to know we're getting done so
I will share the process so starting in
the kitchen we've just basically had a
new neck of white paint on all the walls
the cupboards I've had a new fresh coat
of paint as well just on the outside
just to make them look a little bit more
fresh but I think overdone the inside as
well
good and up here at the top
I put a really nice pink color it's like
a puffy kind of mutual dusky pink I
think that's the Chara one ball one and
well maybe that's one I got from home
base I'm not too sure but yeah so that's
all does he happen in the kitchen
everything's is very dusty and dirty
country we've not been here for two
weeks it's just in the builders really
so it's a little bit grubby and then out
in the corridor so this is the main
landing area we've got dust ships all
along the floor this has all been
painted as well because above me here we
used to have a really bad like water
stain from when the bathroom leaked
upstairs so it's just desperately needed
a new lick of paint and then all the
edging has desperately needed doing the
whole time we've been living here so
it's finally done so go down corridor
you may recognise that we usually have
like a radiator cover on here which
makes it a little bit prettier obviously
they've had to move that to do the
painting and then this is the lounge we
were hoping that we might sleep on the
sofa
but the sofa is currently underneath all
of these boxes obviously before China I
went to America we had to tidy
everything away from the shelves in the
middle of the room so they could access
everything to paint it these are our
shelves currently totally empty and
they've had a fresh lick of white paints
have not been very adventurous of the
paint in here we just wanted to keep it
really nice and bright so even though
it's quite dark outside at the moment
this room still feels really lovely in
light and airy so nothing has really
changed in here fresh paint we're going
to get some new lampshades as well
because those are just super old I also
think when I'm playing stuff back or
this stuff I'm going to have a big big
player out there hopefully maybe do a
card loose till next weekend doesn't
we're going to have a load of house
stuff to get rid of and I think tomorrow
one of the jobs they're going to be
actually replacing these windows
they're so grabby but they're actually I
think the word is bird maybe when
there's like a gap between the double
glazing and there's constant steam
inside them and you can see them so it
just looks like there's water in the
windows which is not what you want
upstairs you can see they've taken the
carpet away from the stairs because
we're getting all the carpet replaced in
the house so they're just wooden bear
steps moment and then we're on the
staircase at the moment this wall here
actually looks white in this light but
it is a very pale dusky pink color very
much like the blush pink on my blog
theme and this is a fireball color I
can't remember the name of my hand but
I'll lean on the screen now because it's
such a beautiful color it looks
different in different lights as well
it's so pretty
see now the lighting is adjusted on the
camera you can tell it's kind of more
pink compared to the white here we
actually have no idea it's not maybe
we've been sleeping bags on the floor in
here cause people are prosecute on a bed
light bar new friends nearby they've got
seven fine art for social spray not bad
shop anyway so this is the room that mum
and I and Charlie painted a few months
ago so this one hasn't has to be
repainted so this is the stuff trim at
the moment it's just got tunnel brittle
prejudice I think they will know it's
gray we painted it gray please yeah so
all of our stuff is in this room at the
moment but all the parts of my desk and
then this is the room that I used to do
a lot of my film in until I started
doing it downstairs but I wanted this
room to be bright bright white so that
it goes bright as possible for filming
again
so this room's had a fresh lick of paint
as well once again all the furniture is
just in the middle of the room and then
because we're getting new carpet
throughout the upstairs they've started
to cut away the carpet at the edge of
the room so they can get really close to
the skirting boards and then down the
corridor this is what mine Charlie's
bedroom currently looks like
pretty grim so we may have to clear a
load of stuff off the bed because I
think this is our best bet for sleeping
tonight looks pretty grim but this is
the room that I'm most pleased with so
far so they've already painted all the
walls in here
this is Pharaoh and bull elephant breath
and I'm so pleased with how this came
out in Sun lights it looks like a dove
gray in sunlight so it looks like a
really light mocha kind of brown it's
just absolute beautiful and then we've
got again from Pharaoh and ball a new
wallpaper you may remember we used to
have this very standard kind of Laura
Ashley blue wallpaper here before which
is what the previous owners put in here
and that this new one is like a wisteria
pattern and it's just so beautiful once
again it catches the light in different
ways and it's like brownie white and
gray shades it really really turns into
the walls and then last but not least I
will attempt to show you what our
ensuite currently looks like so this is
our current ensuite bathroom obviously
we're getting all new tiles which
they're currently putting in for us new
floor tiles as well that's going to be
the shower we're going a new toilet here
new sink and new cabinet
but yeah looking like a bit of a mess
and I just realized of course that the
builders have got my stuff out from
underneath the bed don't if any of you
guys spotted this but that's rather
embarrassing so I think the Charles and
I are going to try and clear this bed
we're probably going to put some dust
sheets on it get out some sleeping bags
and camp in our own house tonight this
room is not getting touched at all and
that we're currently using the bath for
our blogger mail so everything that's
been posted the past couple of weeks has
been put in the bath because we cannot
deal with that right now and yeah this
is pretty much the builders bathroom so
looking a little bit gross oK we've
decided that we're going to sleep in the
bedroom so we're going to start by
trying to tidy up this room a little bit
and thing of course we can make some
space
on the bed at least so that we can sleep
in sleeping bags I don't think there's
any point in getting bedding out because
it's just going to get dusty and dirty
so we're going to camp tonight
so despite the mass of the rest of the
house we've managed to make our badge we
found some bed linen and the duvet
hidden under one of the services we have
a grand total of 4 square feet of
comforts I mean we're going to have to
really careful to not walk around
barefooted because of screws and nails
sticking out all over the place
next up we're going to try to clear out
the bathroom so at least you can shower
without showering and all inside
Malby
okay so we've had our dinner and we're
going to have a fairly early night now
because nothing else that we can really
do in the house so luckily I've managed
to salvage most of my evening skincare
routine first of all going to take the
bulk of my makeup off with some
cleansing water this is what I haven't
actually used it for it's by AB Orion
and it's a three-in-one micellar
cleansing water and I think is the
Korean brand formulated with seven verbs
gently cleanses the skin without drying
it so let's give this a go okay my
camera battery has just died so I'm
gonna do the rest of this log iPhone
what so sorry if the quality is a bit
reporting oh and I can't find anywhere
to prop it up okay world loose
flattering angle that there we go okay
Nadal cleanse and polish orange and
clothes this one always reminds me of
Christmas because I think that's when I
got it maybe it's a Christmas limited
edition but still best cleanser I smell
so good
okay so I've removed my cancer and I
just realized these pajamas are very
revealing these were really good find
they are a good use of the Victoria
Secret ones but these I think we're
about 12 pounds from misguided I think
they might have sold out now fine and
have a little look and if I don't find
them on user link down below I'm going
to brush my teeth
I have no idea where I normal toothbrush
is because we don't have a bathroom
cabinet in the other bathroom anymore
but this is one I use among traveling
it's a brand called
sonic chic I think that's what it's
called which is sonic maybe and sheet
get the model but it's a really good
travel toothbrush because it has a
little lid as well so we get all gross
in my travel bag and then usual
toothpaste this one is censored I'm
pronamel multi-action bright fresh and
clean every day that's what it's called
but yeah I do have quite sensitive teeth
so this is a really good one for me it
means that I can use whitening strips
and my teeth are a little bit more
protected so that's my toothpaste
okay so last but not least I'm going to
put on some of my retinol serum this is
a Lumiere MD which you may recognize
from my skincare secret video this one I
use maybe once or twice a week and it
just helps to resurface the skin keep
the skin looking beautifully glowy helps
promote skin cell regeneration and quite
strong work I do actually notice a
difference with this I don't put too
much on just because my skin is very
sensitive you need to make sure you're
using a really good SPF if you do use a
retinol serum like this one okay so now
I'm just going to go into my bedside
table and find a nice gentle moisturizer
and we're done but then I'm going to end
today's vlog here it's going to get into
bed now I think we're going to watch
line-of-duty were very far behind we're
still watching the Netflix series but
keep seeing people tweet about it so
they were trying desperately to catch up
so I will catch up with you guys in the
morning give this video a thumbs up if
you liked it and if you're excited
jamei and don't forget to leave any
video ideas down in description box and
I'll try my hardest to get through as
many of them as possible thank you so
much for watching see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
