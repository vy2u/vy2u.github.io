weekly vlog it is Tuesday today and the
first day of spring just went to virgin
for our PT session which you guys saw
and now I have a grand total of 13
minutes to get ready
I've just got out the shower and I've
got a busy day ahead and so I'm not
gonna do a long intro because I really
do have to get cracking literally need
to leave the house at 10:30 and it's
currently 1018 so I'm gonna call this
segment 15 minutes to fabulous although
I have less than 15 minutes and so I've
just got out of shower I've popped on my
usual Liz Earle repair moisturizer and
then in my hair I've got my way smooth
hair spray this is brilliant for
detangling and then in the ends I've
popped in my Liz Earle botanical shine
nourishing hair oil everything I've done
so far and I'm gonna now whiz through
the rest of my getting ready stages
briefly chatting through what I'm doing
so you can see how I genuinely get ready
in a rush
I like to use a wet brush these are
really good when you have wet hair
they're very gentle so don't freak for
hers and also just amazing at detangling
next it's the Dyson hair dryer ultimate
speedy hair dryer and then this is
actually a new brush that I've been
loving using lately from a brand called
t3 very pretty and very effective
okay so my hair is about 50% dry I'm
gonna let it air dry a little bit more
while I start my makeup going to use the
Bourjois healthy mix I think this is a
really nice one for Springs it's quite
quite light but it just feels like it's
quite nourishing for skin as well it's
got vitamins in there it's also anti
fatigue and to be honest I just love how
it looks on my skin and then I'm going
to use it cosmetics double ended
foundation brush since getting this
brush I've actually not touched my
Beauty Blender and that is quite a big
deal for me so I'm a huge fan of PT
thunder look how instantly this
foundation just makes my skin looks so
healthy I find it also blends really
really well down my neck for example so
don't get any foundation lines it just
it's great for these kind of speedy
mornings I'd say the coverage is medium
definitely gets rid of any redness it
just gives me a really even complexion
it's got a really nice glow to it I
think it's a really good name healthy
mix because just feels like it makes my
skin look healthy which is great and I'm
also going to use the healthy mace anti
fatigue concealer there are loads of
concealers that I really like at the
moment really like the bare minerals one
but just thought I would go all out with
the Porsche wire this morning and I'm
actually going to use a beauty blender
to blend in the concealer I find it a
bit quicker
okay setting down the base this is the
estee lauder perfectionist set and
highlight basically a powder I'm going
to use a fan brush but it's also got a
little section at the bottom which is
more like a highlight and I find it very
natural I think it keeps my skin looking
like it's got a nice healthy glow which
is what we like it's spring this time of
year it also just sets down any areas
that could potentially get a bit shiny
later in a day my chin make a boys
disappear so I like to focus there as
does my under eye makeup a little bit
more the highlight section and then I'm
going to I'm going to use Estee Lauder
wrong as goddess and then this is a
brush from bareMinerals which I love so
I tend to do the cheekbones so can't
highlight for my life and so I just use
bronzer to have a better definition and
then I tend to go up to the hairline and
then I'm going to use Dior for the brows
this is the Dior show brows Tyler I
think this is the perfect shade and it's
great fun I want to be really quick very
far from perfect brows but that is all
we've got time for then I'm gonna use
bare minerals blusher this is on that
Genet nude collection in the shade beige
for days really nice and natural kind of
everyday color it's almost like a
brownie pink so it really doesn't look
incredibly natural then I'm gonna do
some eye shadow in fact I'm gonna use
this is a little pot from Dior it looks
like this and I'm gonna use so either
brush and it's just a lovely kind of I'd
say it's like a mushroomy taupe shade
great for those days when you just want
a little bit of color benefit these ones
I think are from AB Orion I've been
filming for 12 minutes that means 30 I
need to leave now okay I don't have any
time left to do any more makeup so I'm
gonna make sure my hair's dry and then I
need to get dressed okay while I get
dressed
steamed pod on 180 degrees and I'll see
you in a second okay
we changed hair is a little bit drier
although not 100% dry outfit is all
rates top is Reese from last year skirt
is Reese from this year and I've got my
Pandora necklace on because I have a
Pandora about later nice to wear the
brown steam pod I'm just gonna
straighten with a slight flick on the
end because I don't have time for
anything else
I think that's gonna have to do Jane
last finishing touches perfume I'm gonna
wear flower bond next I love this
fans of flower bond haven't tried this
today's divine lipstick I'm just gonna
pop fall on the clock some lip liner
they're really like fat lip liners so
very quick to do lined my lips in that
this one is the shade under cover and
then I'm just going to use a girl on and
lip balm and then I will put on a
lipstick just before I arrived but my me
to the Sun is coming out so that is good
enough reason need to pop some glasses
on my head in fact I'm actually gonna
put my hair in a low bond until I get
sent it will just give it a little bit
of shape and I hate walking around with
my hair down especially tube time to
unplug everything quick most of lemare
the miss then I'm just gonna shove
everything in my handbag spare battery
phone laptop
it's a twirl so just had a lovely lunch
with this darling lady under spotlight
let's go go somewhere more festering we
went to ill teto
it was amazing it was good we had
Italian we had Virata the starter and
then pizzas illuminate yes charcoal are
a bitch actually very tasty and it was
absolutely delicious
so I'm gonna had two debaters now
because apparently my engagement ring
that has been resized and it is ready to
be collected I'm very much looking
forward to I did make it to my morning
meetings although I was 10 minutes late
so I'll show you what I got from my
meetings when I get home and then it is
off to some
horn events with Pandora so I'll see you
when I get studious
just nipped into DeBeers and picked up
my ring it feels so good to have it back
again and I have not stopped staring at
it they've also cleaned up pieces
looking extra sparkly so
I'm so happy to be reunited with my
beautiful ring basically if you missed
the video where I explained when I took
it in it had to be totally taken apart
and basically rebuilt they had to take
all the Diamonds out and put it in a
whole new ring because it was more than
two sizes different to my actual size
and because obviously DeBeers are such
masters at their art they didn't want to
do anything less than perfect they
didn't want to risk it not being
absolutely perfect by just shortening it
a little bit so yeah they've done an
amazing job and it fits absolutely
perfectly in a taxi now and it's turned
into is the most beautiful day heading
to Malvern High Street
for the event with a Pandora they are
launching or they've just launched their
new connection which is called Pandora
shine and I'm actually working with
Pandora a lot over the next coming weeks
and months so
/ to see lots of lovely new jewelry
launches that are beware
so
what a remote sheep to me I'm gonna tell
you right now
good morning we meet again in my
dressing room today is going to be far
less of a rush because it's Wednesday
and it is a working from home day to day
and then we filming some videos so the
last time I spoke to you I think was at
the Pandora event it was really good fun
we were just making cocktails we were
making espresso martinis and the F scott
Fitzgerald cocktail which was really
good fun managed to not get blackberry
sauce all over my outfit which is
definitely a bonus and yeah then headed
home so really really lovely day
yesterday cannot stop staring at my ring
so very pleased to have this back I
thought I would do another mini get
ready with me less rushed because I have
some lovely products that I want to try
out with you one of my meetings
yesterday was with Lamar and I very
kindly have been given this incredible
box set which is designed to highlight
the fact that their moisturiser which
you guys know I love so much is
available in five different formulas
obviously one size fits all does not
really apply to moisturizer we all have
different skin types different skin
needs and the original is a really rich
moisturizer it's almost like pseudo
creme in consistency or sleep much
better than pseudo cram but very very
rich you have to really rub your hands
together your fingers together and apply
it in a patting technique which is not
for everyone
everyone wants something that rich and
the thing that they've just released is
their new cool gel cream which is this
amazing looking a product here and gel
creams are a lot lighter so if your skin
just doesn't want anything too heavy at
this time of year especially this could
be a really lovely option so I'm going
to try this out some wedding and but
then they've also popped in little small
sizes I didn't even realize they have
this many I kinda thought it was just
the one and then the mattifying one this
is called a balanced affair the
moisturizing matte lotion balances shine
softens lip pause this is obviously just
a little mini one but this is one that
Charlie really likes guys it's really
good
it's mattifying if you have oily skin
again fabulous for that we have the
moisturizing soft cream which is a
little bit lighter than the original but
is still a soft cream
you still get that lovely radiance that
lovely glow to your skin and that
amazing pampering feeling from using LM
a product creme de la Mer moisturizing
cream this is the original I have been
using this throughout the whole of
winter and my skin just absolutely loves
it and then we have the moisturizing
soft lotion I would say this is probably
the lightest of the lot although I
haven't tried the gel cream yet so maybe
that'll be the new lightest and that
this one is especially great for wearing
under makeup it's think it's in really
quickly great if you just need a light
hit of moisturization so that is the the
five ways to love lemare according to
this box of five different formulas of
their amazing and moisturizer
they were also telling me that they have
this incredible pop up coming soon in
London not sure if I'm allowed to talk
too much about it if I am i li the
information about it down below because
if you live in London it's going to be
insane and it's free to go to for you to
discover that mare and if you have
always been quite intrigued about it but
you've never wanted to make that first
investment then it's just a really good
way of discovering the brand so I would
mention that so I'm gonna try the new
moisturizing cool gel cream this morning
consistence you eyes already I can see
that it's much much lighter than the
moisturizing cream the original and that
feels very very cooling if you live in a
hot country if you're going on holiday
this lovely I think actually the amount
that I've applied as far too much this
is spreading really really easily feel
like my skin still feels really
refreshed but I don't feel like there's
loads of product on my face which is
very nice sensation so all of the
moisturizers in the lemare range
including this one have the la Mare
miracle broth inside which is an
ingredient that they've spent many years
developing I think is all based on that
the power natural healing powers of
seaweed and it just basically helps the
skin to renew itself so I would say it
leaves the skin feeling and looking
balanced any information any areas of
redness which I've had on my nose and
chin lately just feel calmed and overall
just nice and healthy I already feel
like my skin is has drunken enough and
is ready for makeup so let's see I might
actually use coming are we filming today
I'm gonna use something
a bit heavier I might mix actually while
I'm using the man I do love the soft
fluid Longworth foundations I'm going to
mix that a real high street and high end
I'm going to mix it with my Rimmel match
perfection because I really like the
coverage of this but it is quite heavy
so I'm gonna lighten it up with some of
the alum airsoft fluid not try this
combination before but I imagine it'll
be divine
then I'm air that I have is also a
little bit dark for my skin at the
moment so this hopefully with the Rimmel
will lighten it a little bit and as
yesterday I'm going to use my it
cosmetics brush but I'm going to tie my
hair at first similar to yesterday I'm
going to use my Bourjois healthy mix my
concealer next this one I'm really
liking at the moment just a very creamy
consistence so you just stop that on
this one also has vitamin E in the
formula it's a nice and nourishing to my
skin my skin under my eyes is quite
dehydrated so this is the same as
yesterday my Estee Lauder
powder
okay next I'm gonna try out another
product that I got yesterday this is the
Concord cream and powder eye color in
the shade soft peach which is literally
the most perfect almost rose gold color
I've spoken about these before I've got
a bronzy colored one as well and the
forming of these that's just divine so
I'm gonna put a little on with my finger
super easy to apply there's also a
sparkly color on the top which is a
little bit too much what I'm going to
use today but if I was going out for a
full day or if I was going out in the
evening then I would definitely add this
sparkle on the top and the mirror in the
lid love these I'm just gonna finish
with some blusher today I'm gonna use
the body Terri this is the compact jewel
light big fan of this one it's a little
bit more colored than the bare minerals
that I used yesterday so good for
filming doing some spring videos today
so I want some nice pink cheeks same
mascara as yesterday okay and I'm just
gonna pop some balm on my lips and then
I'll put on lipstick later and later I'm
going to be using spiced honey from Tom
Ford which is okay so I just started to
curl my hair forgot that I was gonna
film and show you using steam pod once
again and excitingly L'Oreal have said
that they are happy to give away a steam
pod to one of you guys so I'm gonna
leave all the information about a
giveaway down in the comment section
below it's going to be a case of
visiting one of my blog posts and
filling out a Rafflecopter it's all very
self-explanatory but if you fancy
winning a steam pod then I'll leave the
link down below and this is how I curl
my hair with them basically the same
technique as any hair straighteners just
grab a section and then twist at the
and I find it gives a lovely big
natural-looking curl
okay so once all of the hair is combed
as usual I'm going to finish off with
some soft hairspray this one from way as
my favorite doesn't make the hair go
stiff and it's just the perfect amount
of hold and texture as well
this film is are a haul and this is now
what my bedroom looks like Charlie just
bought up all of my blogger mail so I
thought I would unbox this with you guys
okay so let's unbox some blog mail and
also something that I've been working on
or finishing this morning and I've been
working on for about a year I've decided
I'm actually gonna launch tomorrow so by
the time this vlogger goes live you guys
will probably know that I've launched my
own Instagram / Lightroom presets which
basically means that you can download my
presets I'm selling them as a bundle I
will have a special offer on at the
moment it's like an early bird so I'll
leave all the information linked down
below as you can see a little bit of
money as my early bird customers but
basically I get so many questions on how
I edit my Instagram photos and actually
all I do is apply a Lightroom presets on
the computer so I'd never bother with
things like vsco cam I don't bother with
like face tuning anything like that I
just click one button and these presets
which I have been building over the past
year year and a half maybe
I literally have now fine-tuned it I
have presets they absolutely adore I
have one for travel I have one for like
lifestyle photos and one for my fashion
photos I just click one button and that
is my editing done so I thought I would
sell my presets because I do get so many
questions about them and a lot of people
are wanting to up their Instagram game
so leave all of that information linked
down below I will probably talk about it
a little bit more further into the video
but just a really brief overview I have
got three main presets the blush preset
which is what I mostly use on my
Instagram I'll show you a before and
after photo here as you can see what it
looks like and then I've also got my
cappuccino presets which is really good
for lifestyle photos again here's a
before and after and then my jet set
presets and these the ones that I think
could be the most popular I'm selling
them all together it's just one bundle
there's no choices you just get all of
them and they are amazing for travel
photos they just hugely as you can see
here hugely with just one click change
how a photo looks turns it from a really
ordinary photo into something totally
Instagram bull so if you want to up your
photo game then hopefully that will make
it really really easy for you I also use
these presets on videos so if you saw my
video that I did on Wednesday for Estee
Lauder that was all done with my
cappuccino preset I literally just drag
the video files into Lightroom and then
whack the preset on it's so easy could
even use them for like Instagram stories
or if you are a photographer yourself
and you want to make your editing a lot
easier then you can use them for that so
I really hope you guys like them and I'm
so excited to see you using them I do
have a little hashtag which is fashion
one of the presets love it if you would
use that hashtag when you use them on
your Instagram so I can see what
fabulous photos you're taking and how
you're editing them and also if you want
me to feech them on my new Instagram
page which is at fashion on the presets
against it'll be linked down below then
you can send me either to my personal
Instagram accounts or probably better if
you send it to the preset Instagram
account
send me your before-and-after photos and
I will feature at my favorites on that
Instagram account as well as doing a
little shout outs on my personal one so
yeah it is so excited to see what
everybody creates by the time this video
goes live they'll have been up for sale
for like 24 hours so hopefully any bumps
alipin smoothed out but i'm just so
excited to see how everyone reacts and
hopefully everybody apps you loves them
because yeah i have spent the past year
pretty much perfecting my own presets so
it seems kind of mean not to share them
and I thought it'd be a good opportunity
to help you guys improve your instagrams
as well
ramble aside I am now gonna get started
with some vlog amount unboxing and this
first one gosh the address is
practically worn off I don't actually
know if it is from
aha I think this could actually be some
amazing new pieces from coast I was
looking on their website the other day
and they have so many beautiful pieces I
just love coast so much it's so my style
this is a pair of wide leg trousers and
lovely thick materials they're not going
to be see-through which I find it's
often a problem with wide leg trousers
beautiful blush pink color this is a
type of thing that is such a gorgeous
really basic piece before spring
wardrobes then we have a top this is a
Bardot style top this is going to look
so stunning on it's got the smoking
detail around the chest area and then a
bit of smoking on the sleeves and then
you've got some embroidery and kind of
like a what would you call that like a
PK lace detail another one that it's
gonna look absolutely beautiful on
holidays and in springtime and then a
beautiful blouse chose to do the most
gorgeous shirts this one has got a
beautiful waistband like a belt of lace
and then it ties in the middle with a
bow that is gonna look so so gorgeous
cannot wait to give these a try maybe
I'll try them on later in the vlog for
you guys that's a lovely delivery from
coasts and this one this logo looks like
the natural collection from boots logo
don't know if I was expecting anything
from them that's look just grab my
scissors every time I look down and see
my engagement ring it just makes me so
so happy yesterday the Pandora event
Sloat's the girls were just doing an
airing over and saying how sparkly and
how shiny it is I honestly love it so
much so it's not natural collection it's
from the organic pharmacy let's see what
they've popped in here our self-tan oh
my goodness 100% natural DHA from sugar
beet that is intriguing I'm very very
interested to give that a try I hate
pudding
I hate the idea of covering my body in
chemicals but that's kind of what you
have to do when you're fake tanning it's
not particularly good for you but this
is a oh my god scissors in hair way this
sounds fabulous so I'm gonna give that a
go tonight stay tuned I actually already
opened this one because it came to the
house instead of to dawdle but I how's
delivery from Pandora I mentioned
yesterday that I'm going to be working
with them a lot
next couple of months they sent me this
ring here which is like a crown as part
of their new shine collection and they
sent me an actual crown this gold fabric
crown which is amazing and this little
cushion which is what the ring came on
so that was gorgeous they were they said
in the note that they were crowning us
on you Pandora ambassadors which is so
sweet oh this looks rather exciting this
is a huge box come from a PR company not
a beauty brand or anything so I'm not
too sure what's inside oh my goodness so
this is full of P&amp;amp;G products Charlie and
I are working on a charity campaign for
P&amp;amp;G and Marie Curie basically Marie
Curie is a charity that has always been
really really important to me when my
dad was in his last days with us he had
cancer
Maya Curie nurses came and they moved
into our house and they helped care for
him and they helped support us so it's
charity that I've always really wanted
to support and PNG are working really
closely with them again for another year
they're doing a campaign called feel
super where when you go into super drug
and you buy some of these products and
you've got like oral-b toothpaste
you've got shoulders you've got Olay and
ten Gillette
I think her well essences so many brands
that you'll just buy anyway when you buy
these products within a certain time
frame I come and what it is off top of
my head I leave it on the screen now
then P&amp;amp;G will make a donation to Mary
curing and also what Joey and I doing is
we're doing some fun
couples challenges to see who is gonna
be crowned the feel superstar we're
filming that tomorrow actually so it's
gonna be like a fitness challenge and
PNG you're going to be making donations
for every challenge that we compete so
I'm gonna be doing a whole vlog on that
but yeah so if you need to stock up on
any of your beauty essentials then head
to soup truck and do it this month while
PMG will be making the donations to Mary
Curie so this is an amazing bundle of
product that I will be using for that
video this next one is an order from
sweaty Betty my favorite gym clothes I
could not resist this jumper
it says no pain no champagne I feel
brilliance definitely some workout
motivation right there and then these
leggett moves let me show you thing is I
wanted some that was slightly thicker
because it is still quite chilly and I
do have to walk like 20 minutes to get
to the gym so these are slightly thicker
and then they have this zip detail on
them I just thought they would look
absolutely gorgeous I love this color
have a sports bra of a very similar
color so they'll match and full-length
leggings yeah they've got the butt butt
lifting technology in there as well I
just love Swati Betty it's so much
literally only ever wear their clothes
and I workout so got some new pieces man
[Laughter]
so funny but he looks rather rude
Arizona
dude Joe's he'd like to enclose the
first new fragrance Arizona from the
designer duo Proenza Schouler available
exclusively at Selfridges and Debenhams
on the 1st of April this is gonna be the
new fragrance I have seen a lot about
this on Instagram let's have a look like
I'm dig through all the soil ok I just
got back from emptying out all the soil
and now we have this beautiful box it
says Arizona Proenza Schouler on the
front there we have this beautiful pouch
which is actually personalized it's got
jf embossed
in the leather that's so beautiful oh my
goodness ooh now that is a beautiful
looking bottle hopefully that's in focus
let's see how this smells I'm guessing
because the gift or the cactus it's
probably got cactus flower send to it oh
my goodness oh that is gorgeous that is
really like very like natural smelling
but still super feminine really really
unusual and finally I do have a
misguided order here I've ordered a
couple of bits and bobs this first piece
is a bodysuit but it's like a white
blouse I did not know it's gonna have
shoulder pads in it that's a little bit
weird but it's just a very plain white
blouse well then it tucks in at the
bottom it's got these little like Nicola
clip areas it's open at the back which
again I wasn't
expecting but hopefully this could be
quite a nice basic piece for the spring
wardrobe then we have this pair of shoes
and these are kind of dupes for
Valentino they have got the studs on
them I've actually just ordered the
Valentino versions of these are we
really intrigued to see what they are
and how they differ these have obviously
got like hexagonal studs as opposed to
the more square ones that Valentino ones
have but I thought they were fantastic
dupe and I ordered the Valentino ones in
gold
these are Browns I'll wear them
different different outfits so probably
Oh brilliant
this is a faux suede skirt I absolutely
love pink
so it's good um however having looked at
it it doesn't seem to very good quality
like this has not been cut very well at
all the scallops are not really very
even I can literally see like where I
don't know if you can see that there you
can literally see you other seamstresses
scissors have slipped and there's a bit
of a rip in the fabric so that's going
to go back because the quality of that
not good
and then I'm not too sure if this is
going to be too wintery for the time of
year now but I thought this coat was the
most beautiful color really nice for
chilly or spring mornings you're not
quite ready for you're not quite
prepared to go back to your big thick
winter coats that are in non spring-like
colors but I thought this is a really
nice way of transitioning your outerwear
to spring very affordable really
gorgeous color and yeah I will
definitely try that on later but for now
I think I'm going to try to film another
video because the lighting is still
really really good so I'll catch up with
you guys a little bit later
good morning darlings
it is Thursday morning I've just got
back from a really good PT session at
the gym with Adam and today's the day
that I'm launching my Instagram Presets
really excited I'm gonna spend the
morning just kind of tweaking things
finishing the page on my blog that
they're going to be hosted at making
sure that all the downloads work etc and
I thought I would take this opportunity
to have a little Instagram chat here on
my vlog I've had a few questions in the
past where people have asked me to do a
video on editing Instagram photos on
tips on how to grow an Instagram
following and while I definitely don't
feel like I have enough tips to do a
whole video I thought it'd be quite fun
to do a little segment if you will in
today's video
but first coffee my latest obsession is
gales oat milk latte it is literally the
best my personal trainer got me addicted
to this and now I have to have one every
single day bit of an addiction
okay so Instagram tips I would say that
when people ask me for advice on
Instagram on how to grow your following
I always say the same thing and that is
that you have to give people a reason to
follow you I think that there are so
they're obviously there are so many
accounts out there right now and
everybody is quite selective as to what
they want to see we don't want to be
bombarded with messages that were not
really that bothered about so you have
to give people a reason to want to
follow your account so basically you
need to be offering something now what
you are offering someone can vary hugely
person to person and this is obviously
totally different for if you're a
blogger or if you're not a blogger and
you're just using Instagram to show off
your life to friends and family totally
different if you are a blogger and
you're trying to grow your Instagram
then I would say you need to just think
about the audience and what they're
getting from your page so let's think
one example for me I would say why do
people follow my Instagram I would think
it's probably because my image is quite
feminine quite romantic and I guess you
could say quite like an aspirational
look to them and I'm also giving people
fashion content ideas on how to put
outfits together a lot of my images are
shoppable and I think I'm giving people
just fashion inspiration so that's I
think why most people follow
my Instagram account if you have another
reason then let me know but it doesn't
have to be fashion you could be giving
people Fitness inspiration you could be
giving people ideas on where to go out
for dinner you could be doing incredible
inspirational travel imagery in fact I'm
gonna leave a few of my favorite
Instagram accounts linked down below
because there are so many incredible
ones that I follow oh there's so much
inspo so every one that I follow they've
given me a reason to follow them so
definitely my first tip would be to
think about what you're offering your
audience what are they going to get from
following your page
I guess my second tip kind of evolves
from that and that's just to pick
something that you're really passionate
about and then keep on posting that kind
of content to create more of a cohesive
feed so if you're posting about I don't
know sausage dogs one day and then
flowers the next day I'm just kind of
looking around the room for inspiration
if you don't quote some another day and
then you're doing fashion and then
you're doing food then it might not make
sense some people might arrive on your
page they might discover your account
and then they don't really understand
what you're offering them so they may
not choose to follow I think that if
someone arrives on your page whether
they found you on the explore page or
from a blogger that they follow then
they need to look at your page and
instantly know what you are all about no
wait instagrams about are they going to
get fashion from you are they going to
get fitness or beauty or amazing selfies
and family photos whatever it is I think
it needs to be really obvious what your
account is all about so that people
instantly know whether or not they want
to follow you my third tip would be to
make the most of your surroundings now I
know that it's sometimes really hard to
get an Instagram photo every day and
definitely don't pressure yourself it's
not the end of the world if you don't
post every day sometimes I go three or
four days without posting really doesn't
bother me that much but if you are
traveling somewhere really beautiful if
you're in a new city or in a lovely
building and it's really nice to make
the most of your surroundings and then
that means you have a wide variation of
content that you can show to your
audience one thing that I used to
struggle with was keeping it cohesive so
if I was skiing one week and then on a
beach for next week and then just in
London the following week I'd find it
quite hard to make my Instagram quite
consistent and with that I would say
it's important to have a style of
imagery that you always go back to so
that's kind of one reason why I really
like using Lightroom presets because no
to where my photo was taken they always
will have this whitewash kind of pinky
blush vibe to them because I added them
all in the exact same way so for example
on my Instagram right now last week I
was in the mountains skiing and then I
was in an amazing building head saw
houses stunning bridal suite then we've
got photos out and about in London and
yes all the photos aren't identical
because you can't make the Alps and an
Alpine lodge looked exactly the same as
a bridal suite or the streets of London
but because they are all edited in the
exact same way you just make some really
cohesive and I feel like you could
stumble upon a picture and be like
that's very Josie that just fits in my
kind of theme if you will and of course
with Lightroom presets it doesn't have
to always be the same one you can just
have all of your photos having a nice
warm glow to them or you could have a
really desaturated almost monochromatic
look that's the benefit of using a
preset is that any photos that you take
we're just one click it'll instantly
make that photo appropriate to your
style sorry about the lighting I'm
starting the lounge and it's one of
those days where the clouds are just
coming and going oops I just intend to
change the battery so sorry if I'm in a
slightly different position ah
so before I talk a little bit more about
my presets I'm just gonna very quickly
go through equipment I get asked this a
lot - what you take your photos on 99.9%
of my Instagram photos are taken on this
this is a Canon 5d Mark 4 and the reason
the muslim' are taken on this is that
the majority of the images you see on my
Instagram are taken for blog posts so I
fashion blog fashion mumbler comm is my
blog and I create a lot of fashion
content for that so I create a lot of
fashion imagery a lot of outfit posts
and it's these photos I then post on my
Instagram and I just don't find that
phone photos are quite up to scratch for
the quality of content that I want to
proceed on my blog so that's the reason
that most of my photos are taken on this
however the iPhone does take amazing
photos and a lot of people say that
iPhone photos get the best engagement on
Instagram it's all to do with the
elusive algorithm which I personally
don't even think exists but having said
that over the past
couple of months my two most liked
photos aside from our engagement photo
were taken on the iPhone so maybe there
is some method to this madness I don't
know but the iPhone does take amazing
photos and then when I do take photos on
my iPhone I will then airdrop them to my
computer applying my library and preset
and then publish them so these are
basically the only two things that I use
to take my Instagram photos once I've
taken the photo
I'll airdrop it over to my computer to
edit it and the editing process is super
super easy I don't use a load of apps on
my phone I just do one click in
Lightroom maybe adjust the exposure or
the temperature a little bit but not too
much and then a drop it back to my phone
and ready to post Oh actually I do have
one more tip and that is when you are
asking someone else to take your photo
obviously you don't always need someone
to take your photo a lot of people love
to do like from above like big cool leg
photos or selfies most of my photos
99.9% of them are taken by someone else
and my best tip would be well obviously
have a lot of patience with the person
taking your photo especially if you are
a perfectionist and you really want to
get the perfect shot just being kind
being grateful is gonna get you a long
long way when it comes to the person
taking the photos really enjoying taking
them I used to find miss charlie if I
wasn't like super thankful or if I was
rushing him and I was just getting angry
if you didn't get a shot then we would
just never get the shot whereas if you
realistically explained oh by the way
this might take like a couple of minutes
because I'm quite particular about my
Instagram if you say that to someone
before they start taking your photos
there'll be a lot more understanding and
what I also find quite helpful is
sometimes say there's like a perfect
landscape and I've got a vision in my
head of exactly how it wants to look I
will take the photo without me in it and
then say can you recreate this exact
shot and I'll almost like a subphrenic
patch and I think that I'll almost like
position the camera and I'll say okay
this is the shot that I would really
love to get this is where I was holding
the camera to get it and then I've
already done all the settings and
exposure is perfect the lighting is
perfect even at the angle and then all I
have to do is go and stand in the shot
twiddle around and the
/ friend / boyfriend / mom is just stood
there click click clicking away that I
would say is a really good tip for
getting the perfect shot oh and a little
bit of kind of blogger Instagram
etiquette the lines are a little bit
blurred when it comes to a photographer
or a boyfriend
or your mum but I would always say if
another blogger
takes your photo and you are doing and
they have been doing you a favor by
doing so so you're not like paying them
then it is just kind of Instagram
etiquette to credit that person every
little helps like every tag helps it's
not doing you any harm by tagging your
friend or fellow bloggers that took it
so if you're at a blogger event or an
oppressed rip or something and another
blogger takes your photo then it's nice
to just say thank you by crediting them
in the caption so a little bit of
Instagram etiquette as well okey-dokey
so now I'm going to move on to my
Lightroom presets so I'm very excited to
be launching them at the moment it's
10:00 a.m. I'm going to launching them
at midday I think I'm gonna do a little
announcement on Instagram stories but
basically on my Instagram I have been
tweaking I've been using Lightroom for
about two years now and I find it super
super easy I downloaded the Adobe
Creative Suite which means I pay around
ten pound a month and I have Lightroom I
have Photoshop and I have InDesign but I
only use Lightroom and it used to take
me forever to edit all my photos I knew
in my head but I wanted my photos to
look like but I was finding that I was
having to edit every photo individually
and then when I discovered presets I was
like oh my god this is gonna save me a
million hours basically a preset is a
filter you can save it on your laptop
once you have edited a photo to absolute
perfection you can save the preset and
then copy and paste that preset across
all of your photos so as you can imagine
for blog posts and Instagram editing it
saves you so much time on my personal
Instagram as I mentioned I like my
photos to really light and airy and
quite pink and I have developed the
preset which I call my blush preset and
within the blush preset I've got Airy
bright and moody depending on the
lighting depending on how I want the
photo to look so for the preset pack
that I'm selling I've decided to let you
guys in on my personal Instagram preset
the blush one of which you'll get those
three variations
and then I also have a preset called Jet
Set which is the one that I use and I'm
traveling this takes your travel photos
to the next level I'll insert an example
here so this is a photo that we took
just on the camera I don't think he was
even posing on the beach we went to
Maldives last this time last year
actually and that's just kind of like
it's a nice photo because it was taken
in the Maldives
but it's nothing special whereas when
you apply my jet set preset it turns
into this which is takes a very plain
photo into a really really nice photo
and it's just so easy to do if you are a
blogger and you want to just take your
travel blog post to the next level you
can just copy and paste as preset all
over your photos so the jet set preset
also has the three variations Airy
bright and moody you can play around
with all of them they're not set in
stone
once you apply a preset you can increase
exposure or increase the contrast
increase the saturation to make it very
much your own thing and then you can
also save those settings so you have
your own edit of my presets and then the
third one is called the cappuccino
preset sometimes I like to use this one
on more lifestyle posts I actually use
it on videos on my youtube channel as
well if you saw the video I published on
Wednesday a couple of days ago it was in
collaboration with Estee Lauder I wanted
it to have quite like a rustic sepia
feel to it so I actually applied my
cappuccino preset to the entire video is
that something else you can do if you
use iMovie or Final Cut and you just
want to add some beautiful color to your
videos that is a kind of cheeps way of
doing it so so easy so the cappuccino
preset again there are the three
different variations of it just
desaturates brings out the really rich
dark tones it's great for flat layers
it's great for beauty photos so many
different things so with the preset
bundle that I have created I'm going to
be selling nine presets in total so you
get three blush three jet-set and three
cappuccino and hopefully they'll work
for loads of different styles of
Instagram and I'm just so excited to see
what everybody creates with these
presets and then I'm also going to be
doing a giveaway as I mentioned earlier
in the vlog I have a L'Oreal
steam pod to give away so the first
prize is going to meet steam pot and a
bundle of my presets and then for
runner-up prizes are going to be just
