here in some of the house I'm in written
records which if you're following my
blog
you may recognize recently on how I
think this place did see most of a lot
of friendly restaurant in London a
little can show you you get the true
so something basically they have people
and he tells my marble table gorgeous
some zooming and lighter things but I'm
here for a really exciting event this
morning so you guys know how much I love
this Aviva cosmetics well this morning
is incorrect first with the founders
early who I'm opening a fine girl wanna
meet her
because it's such a huge fan of the
Russian national classic so I've got
here a little bit early has been
sneaking out but let's go and have some
better
so this is another reason why I know
things are strong because this is almost
beautiful bathroom you may like you
notice my Instagram because I have such
money taken receivers open here health
um so just next Somerset House after a
really lovely breakfast so nice to me so
II I definitely had a fine girl moment I
showed you a very brief clip of her
talking I felt that weird sewing most of
it so I just showed you a very brief
clip be a really lovely breakfast in my
favorite place and now I'm off and
Collin garden I've got making a ladder a
with a PR company for teaching along
with me for that know so many things in
common today so I will try to film
okay so I'm two meetings down and I just
slipped into the very doctor at UK press
day which I just showed you a couple of
clips of as you can guess by the Brawley
which by the way I figure out it's only
35 past I can link that link down below
if you're interested but yeah that's a
simple press day and I now have about an
hour till until my next meeting cause
I'm going to live in a few shops Zara
have so many nice pieces at the moment
including some very Gucci and five bits
so I'll pick you guys into Zara with me
even helped me decide what to get and
yeah I really like problem garden
shopping so I have a little browse until
my next few things known as do
okay so unsuccessful shopping trip
they were actually loser Breen I season
Zara but I can't really show them around
me all day I'm going to make an online
order later so I will share with you
what I buy anything now I'm going to go
and pull for myself at the urban market
girl here in the common garden my next
meeting is here in about 45 minutes so
I'm going to sit down
rock on with some emails and yeah that's
pretty much me they're going for the
mythical weather although I feel like I
dressed pretty well for it
finally home again after what feels life
has been a really really long day
I forgot how weirdly this camera acts in
the low-level lighting I look like some
kind of orange envelope ah I'm using the
olympus ten today i usually actually use
the canon g7x i get quite a lot
questions on my vlogging equipment I
usually use the canon g7x for vlogging
lighter and I actually kind of prefer
the colorings and also the picture is
wider but I'm on the Olympus PEN that
now because my Canon is doing something
really weird with a memory card it keeps
a memory card locked even though it's
not really annoying so I'm on a pen
which I do love but I just prefer the
g7x for vlogging yeah back home now mum
should be arriving in a minute to get
Dexter tape texture back to our house
because China off to Ireland tomorrow to
Dublin my first time Ireland but yeah I
just had my nails done at now ink
I hope Eddie that the beginning of the
month you guys might remember and that
this was the new and Allison counter in
Selfridges which is so beautiful a
really lovely long counter and the thing
with a pedi you can basically choose any
color from the Nelson collection and
because they use a material or a product
called chroma that just turns any nail
varnish into a gel so I had I think is
called Mayfair something or other but I
did show you a clip of it so yeah
feeling very sad with my new nails I'm
now going to start packing for Ireland
because we got an early start in the
morning and and yeah I'll catch up you
guys in a little while okay excuse how
scary I look obviously I had my brows
waxed at benefit on Carnaby Street
earlier today and I just feel like my
makeup is totally just melted off my
face is going to look a little bit scary
but I just came upstairs and I found a
package shaped like this and yes I have
just put on my channel bottoms and
not going to lie I thought that it was a
toilet leak inside because basically the
builders threw out our old toilet seats
ahead buy new and I
Fairey toilet seat and shapes so I
wasn't really going to vlog opening it
but I have actually just peeled away one
half of it and I can see a certain logo
on it which makes me think that there's
something very exciting inside so I
wanted to share this moment with you
basically it looks like it is a delivery
from YouTube which means I think and of
course this might be my silver play
button so let's have a look inside it
certainly feels pretty heavy ok let's do
this ok so inside we have got a little
letter it says you've just done
something that very few youtubers
accomplished you've had an astonishing a
hundred thousand people subscribe to
your channel we no numbers on YouTube
now really bakery we hope you don't lose
sight of reality behind that six digit
milestone each and every person who has
subscribed to a channel has been touched
by what you did they were inspired or
challenged or entertained ha oh my
goodness
so drumroll please dun dun dun
oh my goodness
guys this is one of those things that
when you start your YouTube channel
I just never ever ever thought would
actually happen it was kind of always a
goal of mine but it was a goal that you
know you just don't think is actually
ever going to happen to you it just
seems something that happens to other
people but it's really funny and I feel
like now it seems like a really good
time to tell you what is engraved on at
my Monica vanilla bracelets so a lot of
you guys saw a video I think it was
probably even before Christmas and when
I told you that I'd bought a Monica
vanilla bracelet and I told you I've got
something special engraved on the inside
of it but I didn't tell you what it was
one or two of you actually guessed it
right and it's worth saying at this
point that when I received the bracelet
I had maybe I don't know but definitely
way under a hundred
and subscribers I was quite a long way
off but as you may know I am a big
believer in the secret so the secret if
you don't know is a book and like a way
of thinking all about using positive
thoughts to attract positive things to
you and there's so many things you can
do that increase your vibrations they
call it to make basically attract sorts
of things to your life so by being
thankful and by imagining your life as
the positive thing is going to happen so
for example if you want to have more
money you should never think that you
can't afford something because by saying
now having them in your mind it means
that you won't yell tore for something
but if you have it in your head that you
have unlimited money that you are
abundant with money then the money will
come to you so it's quite hard to me to
explain but definitely read the secret
and it's so funny because in my lunch
meeting today I was talking it to one of
the girls about the secret how I'd
actually used it to get a Gucci diamond
first handbag basically by thinking
positively and imagining my future with
that bag in my life not thinking I
couldn't afford it really really I
couldn't actually afford it at the time
but when I was on the website I just was
so confident in the fact that I could
afford it so I bought it
and then throw if you guys have every
time the story before I feel like I tell
everyone that I know but then a few
hours or even minutes later like 25
minutes later again email for a blog
campaign for the exact amount of money
as the Gucci diocese that's how it works
it's so powerful and I've spoken to so
many other bloggers that have used the
secret to get things in their life so
you may think I was Benjamin but
basically when I got this bracelet
engraved I did not have a hundred
thousand subscribers I was significantly
below that amount but I knew using a
secret like positive thoughts that I was
going to reach that milestone and I was
so confident that I was going to reach
it that I bought myself this bracelet
with 100,000 engraved underneath it as a
way of celebrating the fact that I've
achieved the milestone even though I
haven't yet I had not got anywhere near
that milestone
but I thought you know what I'm going to
congratulate myself that for getting
there
I'm going to get that engraved on my
bracelet so that is what is engraved
underneath this bracelet I will insert
the close up here of that so I guess the
moral of this story is to think
optimistically think positively and have
faith in yourself and if you want
something desperately to happen then you
can make it happen just like I did with
YouTube so yeah read the secret guys I
think it's life-changing it certainly
changed my life around it changed the
way I think one thing that's so
important in that book is being grateful
for what you have because if you aren't
grateful for what you already have then
more of those things won't come to you
for example if I was to take my
subscribers for granted and just be
complacent then the universe would not
feel the need to give me anymore if that
makes sense but by having in my head
that I'm so grateful for those 126,000
now it proves to the universe that I'm
grateful for them and that just enables
it to grow and grow and grow another
thing that's really important to the
secrets to visualize yourself with the
thing that you really want so for
example it could be visualizing yourself
in your handbag and you boyfriend and
really picturing the life in that way
with the thing that you really want so
vision boards are really powerful way of
doing this I have made vision boards and
a part of things I want to achieve and
for example with YouTube again since
back in November four or five months
before I hit the 100k milestone I was
telling a few blogger friends either I'm
going to get 100,000 YouTube subscribers
in a few months time like I have such
confidence that this is going to happen
and that's another thing that the secret
says is that you have to be so confident
in it have no doubt whatsoever that you
can even tell people like you just say
to people I'm going to have a new
handbag in a few months or I'm not
you're going to get a new job in October
just have so much faith that you are
willing to tell people
so I told actually a girl named Jeff you
may know her as Coco Chelsea I told her
that I was going to get a hundred
thousand subscribers and left her for my
birthday she photoshopped my
my youtube channel with 100,000
subscribers in it so that I could
visualize what my youtube channel would
look like with a hundred thousand
subscribers that's another thing you can
do to really make a secret work for you
so uh I feel like it's just so amazing
it's really funny I was talking to
someone about the secret today and now
my plaque arrives and I can tell you
what was engraved on my bracelet so yeah
definitely let me know if you want me to
talk about the secret more cuz I feel
like it's so incredible so many people
have turned their lives around it and
it's really worked amazingly for me the
first time I discovered it with when I
was in Croatia and I read the books the
first time I won't explain what happened
but it is very goosebump early because
it's just so out of this world what
happened so leave my Croatia blog down
below if you want to see what happened
the first time I use the secret and yeah
so positive thinking and just being
opposed to a person it's all about like
what you put out into the universe you
get back and ah my heart is beating so
fast right now here it is a hundred
thousand plaque here's to the next one
so it's another few hours since I last
picked up the camera I'm in bed now as
you can see looking super shiny I
basically have just cooked myself a mac
and cheese tonight and I just felt like
I needed something some comfort food
it's gross outside and I want you to
celebrate my subscriber button arriving
so that's why did mum have come she's
taken Dexter away I look like Draco
Malfoy and I've set my alarm for half of
5:00 in the morning
ready to go to Dublin Dublin Dublin I
don't know how to say it Dublin Dublin
Center so I always take you guys along
with me to Dublin tomorrow up bright and
early so I'll see you then thank you so
much for watching and give me a thumbs
up it liked it and I'll see you bright
and early in the morning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
