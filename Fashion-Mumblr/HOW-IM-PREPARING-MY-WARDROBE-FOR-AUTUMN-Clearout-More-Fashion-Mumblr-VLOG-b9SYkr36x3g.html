thought I'd give it a weekend vlog for
you guys
how do one of those morning's where I
just haven't really got too much done I
say morning it's just gone mid day and
so far all I've done is lie around in my
pajamas and watch YouTube videos make a
few online orders and actually I did
publish a blog post so that's more an
achievement but until the dogs will walk
now so I should I just need to get out
of house
get some fresh air and start moving and
then I think today I'm going to have a
bit of a session with my wardrobe I'm
going to clear out some old bits through
a charity shop - and I'm also going to
get my autumn clothes down from the loss
because it suddenly feels so autumnal
the blog post I was writing this morning
was all about autumn trends and how to
incorporate them into your water now so
it definitely got me feeling it like I
want to start planning my autumn
wardrobe as I share that with you guys
and also I've really been switching up
my skincare routine recent needs to be a
little bit better for those cooler
months so I'm going to give myself
through the pump session later as well
but for now I'm just going to finish off
my coffee and then take my little babies
for a quick walk
come on
was far ok so just got back home from my
walk I say walk for actually both the
dogs decided that they didn't want
walking so I'm to be carried so I ended
up carrying riverboats most of the way
which is quite funny and we go back home
now and before I get started on my
wardrobe awesome clear out and there has
been a pamper session my skin just feels
like ended up with extra loving I'm
going to go through my weekend kind of
temporary skin care routine I do do this
in the week as well just not quite often
so when my skin is a little bit tired a
little bit dull like it is today I like
to exfoliate and for many many years I
have been using Sinai's my current
favorite is the bright pink lemon and
mandarin orange scrub this has the most
amazing fragrance it smells incredible
and it's kind of so natural as well no
microbeads either oil or natural I think
that apricot particles I don't know
maybe I might make that up actually this
just says a hundred percent natural
exfoliant to gently polish away little
imperfections I think because these a
nice crop that I used to use responding
my first ever exfoliator how to picture
my apricots on the front so it's always
thought that the little grains or
apricot bits but maybe the foreman has
changed them anyway just obsessed ooh
this one smells absolutely heavenly
and and I just really like it for
bringing the radiance back into my
complexion which in the autumn is
definitely something that I need I do
have two others on the range they can
really choose what your skin care need
is on that ticular day
or if you've got particularly black eye
prone skin than perhaps disability given
to you if they're green cheese scrub
charlie actually love this one we leave
in the shower it's really good for just
scrubbing away and you're feeling more
tanned skin and this one is then
nourishing smoothing I think I'll be
using this one a lot more as it really
does get particularly cold a bit bitter
and essentially but you know the
literary wind you to put some really
nourishing
and seizing on the skin so this one says
southern skin and smooth the way China
so I think I'll be using this one later
near but I was there at the moment my
favorite is this one when we start my
wedding my face and copy on so say I do
this maybe two or three times a week and
always one time at weekends sometimes on
a Sunday evening or in China I have a
pamper knife and by viewers I said also
have some I've described in the shower
so I find that by exfoliating two or
three times a week and is super gentle
but it just keeps your skin looking
radiant you don't really have those off
days and keeps any blemishes at bay and
especially as it does start to get more
time knowledge of Goethe I don't find it
harsh either just really nice soft
natural exfoliant massage it in for a
few moments leave a comment down below
if some Isis also your first exfoliator
I feel like I just used it since day one
of even discovering skincare avoid
envelops and Ives and let me know down
below if you're the same I'm sure I'm
not the only one but just origin when
he's using them it's going to work my
fingers again to massage it on I feel
you can always instantly see how much
more of a glow my skin has after using
that as you guys know it's really you
can just get through any of the old dead
skin that might be lurking on top so
just reveal for radiant complexion which
it will love to have so now I'm going to
add a little bit of hydration to my skin
as we do go into awesome is even more
important keep skin hydrated I have been
using it be fortify and something at
there is dirt from Vichy this what I
really like about it is that it's an
additional sector of skincare routine
so you don't have to take anything out
it's like a pre serum please been really
really quickly and it's just an
additional step to be a bit more
hydration to the skin I really like time
fit in the morning and then the serum
that I have been using for nearly a year
now this is a dark I'm engineers ngl
nearly out of my second tube of this so
I will go in and buy a third because I
love it that much all of these products
so far just are really giving my skin
the best chance have and love the glow
and then there's morning am i trippin to
try something new this is a very
luxurious and moisturizer it's a good
man
all today in Perry Al and it comes with
almost like spaceships kind of hot
smells earthy heavenly goodness and it
actually called a face treatment as
opposed to a moisturizer because it's
got so many skin healing and nourishing
benefit so give this a whirl heard good
things I think as we move from summer to
autumn it is always worth switching up
your moisturizer to something a little
bit more luxurious especially if you are
using a gel in the summer which I
sometimes did and it definitely works is
looking at something a little bit more
hydrating a little creamy so eases helps
to keep the skin glowing in the colder
months and finish also a little bit of
lip balm this is my by liver bone this
is my dietary bond rose which rejected
or she has been using it everyday for so
long and yet I still have those the left
of this so there we go that is my
current skincare routine very quick
morning routine but also very comfy and
it's going to hopefully help me keep the
glutes throughout the water month my
skin looks smells and feels pretty
serious right now I'm going to have
spectrum I'm going to go to carry bags
and start pushing out my clothes let's
do it okay
so in my dressing room I think you guys
may have seen on my Instagram stories
but last weekend I just had one of those
like super productive weekends where I
pulled out a load of stuff from my
current season wardrobe which is all
pretty much stuff in here and
and I gave though to start to charity
shops so while my current like stuff
that I bought recently it's all pretty
up-to-date the stuff that I'm going to
be sorting through now is my last year's
autumn and winter stuff so I have a bit
of a system where because I get I get
asked this a lot because obviously I do
love shopping I have a lot of holes
everybody always says like how do you
store everything or what I do is I put
loads of stuff in suitcases like this
one up in the loft so as soon as I feel
like it's slightly gone past the season
and I don't know if I want to sell it or
if I want to keep it I just put it in
suitcases in the loft which means that
as a start of every season I then have
to look through the last year's version
of that season if that makes sense to
see what I'm going to keep on why I'm
going to sell and that works really well
because it means that I don't have to
have it all just filling up space in my
wardrobe and also when it comes to
selling it like for example at the
moment it's going to be selling things
like jewel aids and coats
now it's time of year that people are
actually looking to buy that kind of
stuff so it means that I can sell it at
a time where it's actually going to be
in demand which maybe means I can make a
little bit more money from it and just
means I'm helping people out fitfully
loads up more than just filling the
shops full of little clothes which
nitrifying so that in mind this is all
pretty much last season stuff I think
I've just kind of decided that I am
going to sell a little bit on depop I've
tried depop before but I've not really
had too much success with it and I'm
going to give it a go this time I'll
probably leave stuff up there for a week
or so and see how it sells so I will
leave a link to Iggy Pop shop if I have
in fact set one up and down below and
most of this I would say looking at it I
think 90 99 percent of this stuff is
things that I've kind of sent volt for
myself not gifting from brands not
bought with any gift searches or
anything but if on the occasion that is
something on my depop which has been
bought with a voucher or even gifted I
will put a little symbol in Indian title
and you'll know that all of those
profits are going to charity just to be
totally transparent on that and we have
some live look so the first thing I saw
was this GLA it's a
mr. juillet and I actually love she lays
I wear them a lot but I don't feel like
this is terribly my style I think I will
this maybe once or twice last winter and
it certainly has not got any markings on
it
I think I actually got from MacArthur
Glen super super cozy but I don't think
I'll wear out this year so I'm going to
put that 3 2 nd pop pile I also have
this really big coat which I think it's
a jeweled coat or is it our Crombie have
a look
I would lip see that's random did not
remember getting this but I actually
have quite a lot of this style of like
puffer jacket so again that's going to
go on default this is also going to
close and quite a lot money to post this
stuff isn't it we'll see and then this
looks to be another fluffy kind of part
of coat a very quite nice fitting on my
lip so I think this one might be Topshop
yeah again I just don't really fight
this coat is very much my style so that
as well is going to go indie pop and I
think this was actually my mum's this is
a crew clothing jacket it's like when
these waxy jackets so really go to like
dog walking and I better check it out
not long before I sell it this bag was
labeled as Josie autumn keep so
obviously at the end of last autumn I
decided that this autumn I would want to
keep this stuff but obviously your
tastes change or styles change so I'm
going to go through it again and I think
I'm pretty surprised myself with how
much I actually do want to move on first
of all there's a delay I don't really
feel like this kind of style is going to
come back in fashion too much again this
year
this is Topshop by the way everything is
like five six or eight I don't know I do
quite like it maybe I'll hold onto it
for a little bit longer yeah I think I
will actually and then i've got loads of
this style of thing so I just love cozy
layers like this but again I have got
newer versions of this and I'm sure I
will buy a whole lot more so I'm going
to put that one probably not on the
boxes and Zara and might just give out
and straight to charity this is a brand
new pinky top in fact I think I ordered
this by accident only source and I think
I'll put that on deep or pitch black I
don't really very much clerk
relax trade skirts this one is from
Selfridge think I'll lift that on Deepak
because suede skirts are really popular
and then this I remember wearing this a
lot this is River Island I think is a
lovely juillet again I will this a lot
last year but I think it's a bit dark
for my style now so that's going to go
on depop as well gosh we're doing well
with clear outs a scarf which again I
loved last year not so mad about it this
year few some accessorize new look depop
so next up we have a Rhys cashmere
v-neck jumper this is such beautiful
quality I just don't worry next I feel
like they make me look like a schoolgirl
so that one again is going to go on deep
pop these retail for over 100 pounds
I'll produce Asante pot for like 25
pounds so going to be a bargain then we
have a little Reese Kurt I remember
getting this one actually used to work
at refused to wear this so much but it's
in perfect condition it's a size 4 I'm a
size 6/8 now in Soma size 6 and this
fits perfectly but again we're going to
give that go on D pub a silk shirt which
really needs ironing this is a recent
size for Navy so I'm probably won't wear
it d pop and do the exact same shirt or
blouse I think when in black this will
be really nice uniform if you have to
wear like black all over for uniform it
has got this lace panel down the middle
very very pretty but I don't wear black
there's no point holding on to that part
ok i remember these jumpers I did wear
these a lot they're probably a little
bit probably new once over with the old
bottle off but I guess if I list it as
being a not in perfect condition and
someone just wants to get their hands on
a really nice quality jumper and they
would be pleased with that
so put on do pop again another really
cozy cable knit resize extra small and
I've got quite a lot bubbles on it and
it is a classic but again I just feel
like I've got so many more jumpers like
swimwear it
so now we're going to pop artists when I
was so much last winter you might
remember this in my Nan's and Fashion
Week video this is a Jaeger jumper in a
beautiful pink color absolutely adore
this and I would definitely wear this
all this year so finally we have
something that I'm going to put in the
keep pile and this is another yoga
jumper actually this one is more of a
cape it does kind of need ironing every
time you wear I which does get a bit
annoying but I think this is so
beautiful when it's on it's like a wrap
style jumper I just think it looks so
elegant and I cannot wait to wear that
again and then we have my Club Monaco
jumper
and this is the one that really started
my love affair with ruffles sleeve you
might remember seeing this in vlogs and
blog post last year definitely going to
keep that one so next up this is
something that I've kind of kept for
many years and not warned about the
really special piece for me it's a
Burberry jacket that I got on my 16th
birthday and it's just you know is my
first ever designer piece so I can't
bring myself to get rid of it so I'm
going to keep that one even though I may
not wear it because it's just quite like
a puffy star it's like i'm a bit billowy
for a jacket if that makes sense but
can't bring myself to get rid of that
some tights brand new tights from Bowden
black kanga ray definitely come in handy
this is a pair I think of like pajama
bottoms like super cozy fleecy pajama
bottoms from bedroom athletics I don't
think I wear these again even though
they are like oh these things in the
world but I don't think they would fetch
very much to warrant my postage etc on
depop so they're going to go in the
charity shop pile cozy at home like
jumper dress again I think from bedroom
athletics it can go to the charity shop
Topshop handbag I wore this again a lot
last year during our wear at this year
because I do have so many bags so that
was going to go on deeper and then also
the suitcase is pretty much just filled
with tights because you can never have
too many types and autumns I'm just
going to leave them there I think to be
honest I am going to put and the jumpers
like the yay going to Club Monaco
jumpers back in the suitcase back in the
oft because I don't feel like we're
quite ready for six jumpers yet and it
is quite easy for me to get them down so
I'm going to put all of the keep pile
back in the suitcase and then we're
going to have a rummage through my
existing wardrobe just to see if there's
any more things that I can pluck out to
sell also charity
okay so I'm now going to start the
process of photographing everything and
then I'm going to have a cup of tea and
start listing everything else
okay so all the photographing is done
and not going to lie that took quite a
lot longer than I thought it would so
I'm going to go downstairs I'm going to
get myself a nice cup of tea
I put a jump on actually is getting
chilly already and I'm going to start
listing everything I've got everything
is kind of like hidden away behind the
door here and hopefully some stuff will
sell as I'm sold by the end of this week
I think I will just and take it to shad
shop with those such high-value bits I
really don't know fingers crossed bits
and bobs sell and so yeah I have to say
my skin is looking pretty glowy very
very happy with my skin it feels so
comfortable as well which is just what
you need when you're having a day at
home but yeah it does feel like it'd be
a good base for makeup as well find that
when your skin is polished everything
you put on top just really works as fast
so yeah feeling good yeah let's go
stairs and sauce thanks while I'm down
here and let me show you Dickens did i
disturb you somebody was looking very
peaceful on the sofa stretching boy oh
I'm excited to see how Dickens reacts to
autumn of course he was a spring baby so
he's not experienced autumn before have
you monkey no I was going to show you
some beautiful flowers that I was very
very kindly sent me other day how
stunning are these I think they're the
most beautiful flowers I have ever been
sent we were sent by two lovely girls
from ghulam so feeling very very
grateful for those and then let me just
flip the camera around look at that face
look at that face
and you would Sarah are you it Sarah
oh and a hard day it's been a hard day
for my monkey yeah I picked up a couple
of new bits and bobs from Anthropologie
the other day I got these lovely stone
coasters coming the name of the crystal
I think is like Errol diet or something
along those lines so got those and then
I also could not resist this notebook so
I go through notebooks like there's no
tomorrow always making to-do list and
this is like a folio that's leather and
then inside you can like make your to-do
lists and I can exchange this when it
gets full and it came with its own
rose-gold pence that was my real
anthropology halls
good morning it's Sunday and I'm going
to go to the gym first thing this
morning try and blow away the cobwebs
yesterday felt like a bit of a lazy day
and as you probably saw we had our
weekly honest burger last night
definitely encouraged to burn
I've just been free package my gym
shower bag so this is the bag that I
take in the shower with me our hot water
at home is just terrible never really
works and I preferred to shower at the
gym when I can so I'm going to have a
bit of a fake tan session today so I put
in my feet Liberata superfine skin
polish this is probably the greenest
exfoliator that I have so it really
helps to just buff away everything on
the body ready for a good fake tan and I
haven't given my hair a deep conditioned
mask for a while so this is the
Kerastase mask density I'm going to
leave that on for like five minutes
well I exfoliate the body I bought the
Sun eyes oatmeal scrub this is the
nourishing and smoothing one so I
thought that'd be nice one off the gym
and keep the face buffed ready for
tanning and then I've got L'Oreal
professional Sarah flash this is a
purple shampoo that helps to neutralize
any orange tones in blonde hair and then
I've also packed my fake tan and just a
bits and bobs to really pamper after the
gym and then I'm going to go meet Vicky
for a coffee so a productive start to
the day back home from the gym now had a
really good session although it was so
busy in there Sunday mornings was just
ridiculous in the gym but I still
managed to do the 20 minutes hit on the
treadmill I find that that's the best
for my body type especially I'm trying
to burn off from a naughty day I just do
like 30 minutes level 17 with an incline
and then about a minute recovery do that
over and over again about 10 times and
then by the end of it amounts knackered
and then I'd a little bit on the rowing
machine added the leg weights abductors
that would have caught and and I've used
a Roman chair to do some ABS so a good
session all over
then I used the fake town in changing
rooms which I was doing some weird looks
not gonna lie but yeah a little bit more
bronze now and then I went to met Vicki
we had a really nice coffee I have
avocado and toasted Gail's so really
good starts a day and it's a beautiful
beautiful day today so I'm determined to
be really productive already stripped
the bed and got a washing machine and
push out the rest of the washing ready
to go in and say I'm going to cleanse my
makeup brushes and peach blenders in a
second because that's what I tend to do
on a Sunday but first I'm going to run
down städel see if there's any bloggers
mail because I do want to film a hole
later it's not often that the sky is
blue and when it is I need to make the
most of it and get filming so I'm going
to do this afternoon charlie system in
watching football all day so means I get
a day to do whatever key llq dokey I've
got back from doddle so I would very
quickly show you some of the bits and
bobs that I have wrought first of all I
have a big a sauce order but I think I'm
actually going to film a few whole
videos for next week's I'm going to save
that one let me know if you'd like to
know the whole week I know it's like
kind of weird in between season at the
moment where we don't really want to
start buying our autumn stuff yet but
especially on days like today like it
must be 24 degrees out there and but it
feels kind of silly spending money on
summer stuff so if you are also not sure
what you're buying at the moment and you
like a whole week then let me know and
the blog amount arrives I always love
the packaging so pretty it's kind of a
quick finish and I pick one in season
three teas got a few castle meringues
from meringue gold and oh it's from
formula
1006 and not sure how you officially say
that this is an energizing peel mask
that sounds lovely and be ready be very
ready daily foaming cleanser I'm not
usually fun foaming cleansers because
I'm fun I'm quite harsh but this one
sounds like it's got some really nice
ingredients coconut milk soothes and
nourishes the skin so maybe this can be
the one that changes my opinion so thank

a whole new range on Barry's very
lucious skincare need to sit on

so I'll catch up with you guys in a
little bit okay I put you off on a
little tripod now that I can go
hands-free I'm going to get ready to
film my video so I'm going to curl my
hair and I would very kindly sent a
couple of days ago the new steam pot so
L'Oreal steam pot and I went through
probably use this for like a year
non-stop and absolutely love the curl
that gave my hair obviously they curl
with steam as well as having these like
straightening balls what are they called
plates I guess so you kind of get the
best of both but it's really big it took
me a long time before I could curl with
it but now it's very easy if you're good
at coming out how it straightens and
it's pretty much no real difference so
it's what I've give it a go for you this
one is no different normal one it's just
got this really cool pattern on it it's
like a Japanese garden style which is
really pretty so I'm just going to start
by brushing my hair and the steam pod
has little arrows on it so these hours
are going down so you know which way to
curl your hair or which way straighten
it which is just helpful to the lies it
goes a little bit weird
and it takes a little bit longer t-tops
and normal straighteners but when this
starts steaming which by the sounds of
it it's about to I have this little pod
and if you can see it and which has
little suction cups on it that's where
the water is and then yeah there we go
you can hear it just starting to steam
now so I just take section by section
and then coil it in the same way as you
would with straightness pretty much
so put your day might go to better what
I'm doing so I'm not the most skilled
person and curling my hair so I'm sure
there's tutorials online on how students
but better but I just take section of
hair bump it in and then twist it
tensely should curl it round nice little
girl okay so now that I've run curls all
the way through my hair I'm just going
to leave it to cool down because that's
when the hair kind of sets and then I'll
rough it up a little bit after it's all
nice and cool
okay so I'm in the middle of doing the
haul video and I just have to show you
one side this room is there is stuff
everywhere because I've got the stuff
that I'm yet to try on the stuff that I
have tried on and I'm keeping the stuff
that I've tried on and I'm not keeping
just piles of clothes everywhere the
tomb was messy to start with but now
it's just an upscale on site and on the
other hand this is the cutest thing in
the whole so far it's like a little
dressing gown with faux fur sleeves and
super cozy from a source I will leave a
link to it down below and but yeah it's
going well you can probably go another
15 minutes of trying on clips to film
and then I'm going to reward myself with
cup of tea and
Omega is meringue Somalia so I finally
have a tidy or tardies it's going to get
room I can see the floor again which is
definitely a bonus I just unbox a little
bit of blogger mail on Instagram stories
and index to start and shredding on the
packaging and so that was fun and then I
did a little Instagram live which was
nice to chat to everybody and answer a
few questions I think I'm going to do a
couple of Instagram stories now about
Olympus lenses because I always get so
many questions about what lenses I use
on my pen I use the twenty five mil for
like really high depth of field outfit
photos if you want a major blurry
background that's quite an expensive one
they do have a 25 cent discount code at
the moment switch I'll leave a link down
below so a really good time to get it
all the 45 mil lens is good for like if
you're a blogger and you don't want to
spend too much money I think it 148 so
in my discount code I'd be like 110
pounds so yeah I'm going to do some
Instagram stories about that my discount
code works on the EPL 8 camera and all
the lenses so pretty good time to get it
if you're thinking about it it's only
valid until the 1st of September so
don't hang around but yes I'm going to
do that and then I've just managed to
persuade charlie that we should have mac
and cheese without steak tonight on the
BBQ so after my Instagram stories I'm
going to go and make that and then it's
our very chilled somethingyou things
dinner is all ready I thought my steak
oh my god an audience member
steak mac and cheese Carrollton broccoli
and spinach the same and I'm just an
editing this vlog and it's already
rather long so without further ado I'm
going to round it up here thank you guys
for watching if you got to the end then
somehow mention mac and cheese in your
comments so that I know who you
wonderful people are casually watch all
those areas and yes so for me I hope you
enjoyed spending the weekend with me and
my hounds and I'll see the next one
