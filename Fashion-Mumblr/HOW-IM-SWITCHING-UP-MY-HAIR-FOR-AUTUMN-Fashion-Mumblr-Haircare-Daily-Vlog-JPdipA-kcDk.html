daily vlog or maybe a 2-day vlog I
haven't quite decided what I'm gonna do
yet but I decided to pick up the camera
and start vlogging because I feel like
it's been forever since I've logged and
I need to get back into the swing of
things so today is gonna be quite fun
day I've already had a fairly busy slash
productive morning I went to the gym for
the first time in two weeks the first
time since our trip to Greece and I
didn't go too hard I didn't come out the
gym feeling like yeah that was a good
session so I've got a personal training
session tomorrow which will definitely
make up for it the main reason for
wanting to go to the gym is that I had
some new gym clothes and that definitely
motivated me to get off my butt and then
this morning I have been filming a whole
video including this dress which I'm
obsessed with um and that's why I'm
wearing so much makeup because I don't
normally wear this much but yeah so
today I am heading into town now and I'm
getting a hair treatment slash blow-dry
I'm going to a salon called muse of
London and I'm going to be ending a
treatment using the products from the
catwalk by TG range which as you guys
know I am obsessed with I have had my
hair colored recently I had highlights
put in really really pleased with the
color it's a little bit more natural I
think if you read the blog post I wrote
again in collaboration with catwalk by
TG a little while ago you'll have read
that I wasn't happy with how my hair
looked when it was bleached it just was
too unnatural really didn't suit me so
what I asked them to do last time I was
in the salon was to use a toner to bring
this color a little bit more natural I
still have roots because I mean that's
my natural hair color and the bleach is
always going to taint the shade because
of all this torture that I put my hair
through it does require a lot of extra
love and attention I did let you know a
few vlogs ago about the honey and
oatmeal or as I like to call it the ev1
and meal shampoo and conditioner range
and that's what I used this morning I
don't know why I washed my hair this
morning I'm about to get a treatment but
I'm glad I did because my hair is so
soft it's just really great for
repairing dry damaged hair which if your
hair is colored like mine is it's just
such a savior my hair feels actually in
good condition which is quite crazy
considering what I've put it through but
because of all this coloring treatment
and because we're going into autumn it's
that time of year when we have heating
and we have cold spells and we have wind
and we have clothes that are like
wrapped all around our shoulders
potentially breaking our hair I wanted
to put in that for a hair treatment to
really nourish it bring it back to the
best health possible and hopefully bring
a little bit of shine back so that's
what we're going to do today so I'll
take you along to someone with me and
then because the salon is on Mortimer's
Street which is parallel to Oxford
Street of course I'm going to do a bit
of shopping I have my eye on a bag in
Zara it's pretty much a dupe for the
cult Gaia bags you know those wooden
ones that every blogger has I don't want
to spend that much money but Bazaar I
have one that's beautiful and very
similar and might go on a mission for
that and then I'm going to a screening
later on and it's Reese Witherspoon's
new film Reese is the ambassador for
Elizabeth Arden I have been obsessed
with Reese Witherspoon since basically
basing my teenage years on Elle Woods
from Legally Blonde so it's gonna be
very surreal at meeting my childhood
icon if you will so yeah that's why I
thought I would vlog it's gonna be such
a fun day so let's get going
little monkey went to the vets this
morning was he brave daddy very very I
was a brave boy how did this mother dog
in there and I scared you I scared him
quite a bit I'd quite like a cat walk by
TG hair treatment oh yes you would make
me nice and glossy I don't need any hair
treatments I've got lousy Farage's I'm
so handsome you see see you later taxi
mommy loves you see you later my sweet
Rooney
okay just arrived in the salon and
Roland is explaining to me what we're
going to do with my hair I'm going to be
getting a catwalk excited about using
the catwalk by TG products and he's also
offered to cut my hair which i think is
definitely needed cannot even tell you
the last time I had my hair cut but
first of all gonna have a nice and
nourishing treatment so you're going to
find something to repair and hopefully
stop the breakage so let's see what you
recommend this is potentially the least
lateral angle ever and I'm gonna Roland
yeah let us know what we are using
Roland we using today the capital planet
shampoo conditioner bus okay why have
you chosen that one so since you've been
having okay I'll fix you what I'm not
looking so crazy
another very fetching look I have a bag
over my head and this is because I've
got the toning mask in my hair at the
moment and it needs about ten minutes
for it to work it's magic
it'll just neutralize any brassy tones
my hair and also condition as well so
while that sinks in I'm going to enjoy
my chicken Lissie
okay so we've just finished a blow
drying and we put in the catwalk right
TG for defying spray just a small amount
says a little bit of hold but also adds
some volume I was just continued
stroking my hat because I can't believe
how soft it feels you know sometimes
when you get it blow dry you put some
products in it ways the hair down you
can almost feel it this just feels like
fresh hair nothing in and yet I still
have that volume so definitely going to
be trying this at home my own home blow
dries now we are going to oh and you can
also see the color just looks a lot more
natural there's no yellow tones no
orange Ness and that's because we use
this one which is the fashion astir
conditioner this is obviously a salon
sizes but you can get at home same shape
as my honey and oatmeal one which I was
talking about earlier
that's been put in at the moment so I
think Roland is now gonna add some waves
so runners just given me another tip
we've put in a little bit of the
transforming a dry shampoo from the
catwalk right TG range and this is just
going to add a little bit of kind of
grit and volume to my hair as our about
style it when the Styles last as long as
possible system added a little bit of
texture to the hair
all right we just left the hair salon I
honestly cannot get over the color
difference in my hair like this is my
dream hair color it's not bright blonde
I'm moving away from the bleach finally
hallelujah and it just looks like a
really nice kind of autumnal long I
don't think you'd call this fur on door
I'm making up words that's how thrilled
I am with a hair color but yes the whole
catwalk by TG sellin experience was
amazing
we've just been shootin some outfit
photos just to make the most dope while
my hair looks good because it's windy
and my style may not last long so making
the most it while it lasts but yeah
seeing as we are on Ultima Street I
think the close proximity is our I mean
so we're just gonna have to go and hit
the shops so
me they just one escape go I just tried
to
you could just
just do it
you're good
good
another Savior
so after a successful trip to Zara we're
now craving some things filling and but
also healthy so we're going to check out
the new sweaty better flagship which I
can see from here good right place
because they basically shut down their
very small Carnaby Street store and have
launched a massive I think it's like a
three-story flagship so looking forward
to checking this out look at the new
fitness way and hopefully
tell me
but the never seems to have let me come
inside
it's a me I look good so we have I want
you to show me now
show me
on the top floor of 30 Betty flagship
and there's a and I've just got a DIY
decorate your own so nuts and a skin
rejuvenating Smith is on its way they
also allow dogs here I've just met the
most beautiful dapple short-haired AXI
so now that we know that this is here
and you can get healthy snacks all day
and you can bring dogs it's basically
going to be kind of my new office
our name was Arnie okay so after a quick
to tool around Soho in a few shops and
I'm just falling in love with this
veggie patty flagship we are now on our
way to the Atheneum I think that's what
it's called and that is a hotel where
we're meeting the girls from Elizabeth
Arden and we are then they're going to
be going across the road to the curves
in cinema which is where the screening
is going to be can't remember the name
of the film but you will see that in a
second
and Reese Witherspoon is going to be
like launching it and introducing it so
hopefully I'll be able to film a few
clips with her home again home again
home again is the name of the film I'm
gonna try not to be a stalker at the
same time I do really want to get a
picture with her but I'm not good at
being a fangirl so we shall see
keep your fingers on me on another note
really impressed with how this
foundation has lasted and I wish I could
remember which one I put on
it was a really cakey earlier but I like
how it's kind of glowing now I think it
was the bareMinerals complexion Pro
which I'm loving a moment I put the Ren
perfect canvas primer on before that so
maybe that's always last in a long time
that's a lot of skincare update for you
does anyone make we would think not we
should go
whatever region
I know
so
back home again no pun intended that was
the name of the film it was such a
lovely film so Reese Witherspoon
introduced it as you guys saw and yeah
it's kind of hard to describe the plot
I'm not going to ruin it for you guys
but it's a really nice chick flick not
the kind of one that your boyfriend
wouldn't want to watch I feel like
Charlie would really enjoy that one as
well
definitely one not gonna have to get on
DVD to keep on my video rack video god
that shows my age DVD or bluray rack
anyway so home again it's only 9 o'clock
so I'm not too much of a late night for
granny over here and I'm gonna have a
really nice pamper skincare routine
after doing the city I feel like I need
it also in our goodie bags from
Elizabeth Arden we got some of their
ceramide capsules these are probably one
of my favorite skincare things ever they
just feel like liquid silk on your face
so so nice and yeah I'm gonna take my
makeup off and then apply some new
so now that I have used my little water
to get rid of all my makeup and then I
used the Sano flaw botanical essence
which is kind of like a tone of a little
bit more gentle the rest of my evening
skincare routine happens in bed so
tonight and I don't always do this but I
have quite a lot of blemishes at the
moment and I think from Fashion Week and
dehydration and being in the city too
much so I'm going to put on my favorite
spot remover this I have been using
since one of my friends recommended this
to me about five years ago and it's
probably the second product I ever
bought from origins fully expensive for
how small it is but this is the super
spot remover and it is the only thing
that I would pretty much ever use in my
spots ever again because it's so good
you can really feel it tingle and you
only need a tiny bit doesn't really
matter that it's so small so I'm gonna
put a little bit of this on my blemishes
sorry TMI but it's what we got to do
next I'm going to deal with my under
eyes anti-aging and puffiness etc this
is from the Estee Lauder advanced night
repair range I am a huge fan of this
entire range and I switch the advanced
night repair into my evening routine on
and off all the time this is the
advanced night repair I concentrate
remit matrix and we're just gonna use
the applicator that comes in the pot to
put a little bit on my fingers and then
dab that into my under eye and now the
stage I have most been looking forward
to this is one of the little Elizabeth
Arden ceramide capsules it's filled with
the youth restoring serum I think it's
called which is honestly the most
incredibly textured serum you'll ever
apply to your face I used to use these
all the time when I was traveling
they're so good you can just kind of
pick the amount that you need depending
on the amount of days you're going
traveling just twist the top and then
put the serum on your face honestly if
you ever try these you'll get hooked
they feel so it's so good so I'm going
to apply this all over my face and now
oh my goodness I just have no words foul
soft my faces right now these are just
incredible honestly cannot recommend
them enough try and get yourself a
little sample pot if you ever see them
in a gift with purchase but trust me
you'll become addicted so now I don't
want to like blend this out with my
moisturizer or anything so what I tend
to do is leave it for about 15 to 20
minutes with just this on my face which
is normally when Charlie would come up
and start watching TV I'm sure he'll be
up any second and then in about 20
minutes I will put on my moisturizer I
vary it up with my moisturizers I have a
really nice Animus one which I
absolutely love it is the peptide night
recovery cream oil this is one that I
absolutely love and then more recently
I've been trying the LMS dynamic
resurfacing night cream which is really
good for just continually regenerating
at those skin cells on your face keeping
your skin glowing so that's probably
what I'll pop on tonight in about 25
minutes time but for now I think I'm
going to sign off actually I was going
to do maybe a two day vlog but having
looked at my diary tomorrow it's a
little bit manic so I don't think I'll
be able to vlog too much so I hope you
don't mind that this is a one day vlog
let me know if you like these kind of
one day vlogs or if you'd rather I did
weekly vlogs just let me know your
thoughts down below and and if you got
this far leave a little sparkle emoji
interpret that how you will down in the
description box below or the comments
section so I knew if you got to the end
um and yeah that's all for me so thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
very soon in my next one
