me for today's video and today i'm gonna
be talking about one of my favorite
subjects when it comes to fashion and it
is accessories so accessories are
probably my favorite parts of putting an
outfit together you can really use
accessories to draw attention to your
favorite bits or to track remove areas
that you're not quite so confident about
and accessories are a way for you to
inject trends and your outfit without
having to spend tons of money on a whole
new set of clothes so Thursday's are so
you love accessorizing my outfits if you
thought my how to look expensive video
then probably you will remember the ones
main takeaways for that video was that
investing in accessories is a great way
to add a look and that your whole look
look more expensive but without having
to rush out and horny wardrobe
personally I find that accessories are a
way of making or breaking an outfit so
in today's video I'm going to be showing
you a few tips on how to choose the
right accessories how to style it outfit
with accessory and I'm going to show you
a few of my very own favorite
so without further ado let's get started
so accessories encompasses a whole range
of pieces from jewelry sunglasses hats
scarves shoes bags watches etc but I'm
going to get started with jewelry with
jewelry I really like to go in at the
kind of premium price bracket so like my
clothes I shop from places like Greece
whistles All Saints those kind of
retailers it's the same when it comes to
jewelry I find it when it's not quite
high straighten not quite designer it's
a really nice middle ground of timeless
investment pieces a brand that I love
and you guys have seen me wearing so
much that perfectly fits in that price
bracket is after them years their pieces
are all beautifully timeless very
delicate very feminine and very much my
style and over the past few months I've
picked up quite a few other pieces and I
just find that they work with so many
different outfits because of their
versatility I am happy to spend just a
little bit more cuz I know that I will
get so much use out of them that'd be my
first tip is investing in something
timeless and that way you'll wear a time
and time again so I thought I would let
you know about a few my favorite jewelry
pieces from the brand this is the mystic
ring I've been wearing this non-stop the
past few weeks it's a very delicate
style it for these three different tiers
which does make it a bit more unusual
but it's still very delicate and when it
comes to choosing rings I really like
delicate
because they make your fingers look a
lot longer also another tip on that
point is to add some new nail varnish
new nail varnish and delicate rings
really hope that you don't get the
fingers and key hands of your very
delicate feminine so I want to say
delicate one more time
most of my Astrid mu pieces are rose
gold I have chosen to keep everything
within this metal color because it means
I can mix and match and be sure that
everything matches together perfectly
they also got silver pieces and yellow
gold and personally I'm a big fan of
rose gold as you can control detail
I've also invested in some ear jackets
now these are a little bit more unusual
because they've got the design at the
back as well I didn't think I was cool
enough pull them off but since I started
wearing them I've been getting lots of
questions and lots of compliments about
them and now they're pretty much my
favorite earring style and then I've
also been picking up a few beautiful
bracelets this one is a thing called the
tuxedo style just very simple very
feminine and very timeless designs I
also have a moon diamante encrusted
necklace it's got a low hanging bar
which really elongates the neckline very
feminine and it's a really beautiful
design detail a little bit more unusual
to other necklaces in my collection so
moving on to bags and those of you that
did watch my house of expense the video
you may remember that I mentioned that
bags for me are another area that I
really do like to invest and by having a
slightly more premium or even designer
handbag it just makes me feel like my
whole outfits more pull together and
commit your whole outfit look more
designer always look more expensive just
by having that one statement piece I do
have a few tips for buying handbags such
as firstly choosing a very classic
design of course there are so many
trends they can go and if you do spend
that amount of money that you've saved
up for a handbag and then the next
season it's not on trend that some
pretty much to my damage rate in my
opinion so I first go for more timeless
pieces this is my new baby this is the
YSL sunset bag this is actually a very
on-trend start moment but I've gone for
it in a classic color so even when the
sunset design does go out fashion
hopefully won't be too soon because it
is such a neutral shade I feel I can get
away with wearing this season after
season I picked it up now in the summer
but because of this beautiful shade
hopefully it will keep me going
throughout all the autumn winter months
and we help to elevate those stars
outfit another reason why I chose is bad
clothes because of the material this is
something else you very aware of when
you're choosing a handbag personally I
like to go for faux crocodile pebble
skin are kind of Saffiano leather
I think they call it caviar leather
where the little tiny dots these are the
most hard wearing types of leather you
don't necessarily want to be going for
spongy leather or suede because it can
damage very easily if you are saving up
for that one special bag purchase you
want to go something a little bit more
sturdy and hard wearing to look it's
best for as long as possible as you can
imagine I do have a lot more that I
could say about tips behind handbags so
he guys would like a bag specific video
my top tips on how to buy maybe a first
designer handbag I have kept them and
let me know because I definitely feel
like I've got enough to say to do a
whole video about buying handbags my
final tip when it comes to choosing a
bag is to consider your height if you're
tall then you can most definitely get
away with a big bag like a bucket bag
but for us as smaller dolls they can
perform for us and make us look even
smaller which is why I like to go for
something slightly smaller and will
teach my everyday handbag just to
balance out your height shoes are
another of my favorite accessories they
can really totally switch off now for it
from being casual to being smart and
everything in between take this outfit
that I'm wearing right now for example I
have a couple of pairs of shoes the way
they lifestyle them has the potential to
completely change how this outfit look
firstly is a pair of mules and these are
of course statement very well for me
they're not blush finger they're not
white really push the Rosalia they are
leopard print Gucci mules both of these
on net shorter and just apps you found
over them and not going to lie I'm
trying to channel that really cool
fashion bloggers vibrant I'm wearing
these I do style these wizzy trousers
and I feel like it gave me quite a cool
street style look however I also love it
to style these trousers with something a
little bit more girly a little bit more
feminine and it just as a totally
different finished look so my point
being is that you can really mix and
match your shoes to totally change up
your outfit when it comes to buying
designer shoes I do have a few tips as
well for how to invest in the right pair
of shoes firstly is to go for a more
natural material of course leather being
the best option not only is it more
comfortable but also after a few users
they're not going to smell which
Stephanie at one point
also when it
- leather I would definitely recommend
choosing a patent material it's a lot
more hard wearing in fact I remember for
my graduation I splurged on my very
first pair of designer shoes you
probably all know already the Valentino
rock studs in a patent leather my best
friend got the exact same pair of shoes
been his spongy leather and after just
one day of wearing hers were totally
scratched and she actually took them
back to the store so tip number one when
it comes in Spanish shoes is patent
leather is probably most hard-wearing
option personally I like to go to
neutral colors no surprise there so I
find the new shoes really elongate the
leg throw classic for a stylish and very
timeless as well of course tip number
three would be to make sure you try them
on and try trying on in the afternoon as
well because when you're shopping in
particular your feet do temper swell up
and if you buy a pair of shoes in the
morning and then you can wearing them
all day and event then in the afternoon
and they may be far too tight because if
you have gained even potentially a whole
size which may be disasters so try try
more shoes in the afternoon just make
sure they fit perfectly so the sign
except read and range Atul clouds in
this video is sunglasses and a big fan
of sunglasses and I have quite a
selection this is the pair 11 why the
most of the summer they are my mango
tortoiseshell sunglasses sunglasses
range in price so so hugely from just a
few pounds up to hundreds of pounds if
you are thinking of investing in a pair
of designer sunglasses my tip would be
to really expand the few different
styles and shapes from the high street
before you go in and invest in a more
premium care I find that the cat eye
shape is the shape that suits my face
the most so if I were to invest in a
desired pair of sunglasses that is the
style that I would go for another tip is
to choose a pair specially if you've got
long hat that don't have these little
bits on the nose because they just ruin
any potential hairstyle personally I
find a little more comfortable and a lot
more wearable if they don't have little
modules one of those and my final tip
for sunglasses would be to have a really
affordable pad you can take when you're
holiday because when we're on the beach
when you're in the sea and the sand they
do fall off they do sometimes fall into
the ocean and shopping and you don't
want to lose your favorite designer pair
of sunglasses right on the beach so keep
a look out on the high streets and
affordable pairs you can wear on your
holiday safe in the knowledge that
you're not going to
a hundred pounds if they do get lost or
damaged so those are my tips on how to
accessorize these of course are very
summer focused accessory tips and we're
coming into autumn winter so let me know
