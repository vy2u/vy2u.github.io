much for joining me for today's video
today we're going to be discussing your
signature style and how you can find
your personal style in 2018 so whether
you are looking for a total wardrobe and
style overhaul or if you just want to
make a few small changes then hopefully
this video is going to be really really
useful for you I did a video a couple of
weeks ago all about how to refresh your
wardrobe for 2018 and one of the topics
that I touched upon is having a look at
your existing wardrobe and thinking do
these items represent my personal style
and a lot of you picked up on that point
and wanted to know more about how to
find your personal style so that's what
this video is going to be all about I
would say that over the last year to 18
months I've really kind of found and
cemented my personal style I've always
had a really feminine and girly kind of
look but I think it has been over the
recent months I've really stuck to it
and made that my personal style and I
think that by having such a strong
personal style it means that when I open
my wardrobe I'm really confident that
I'm going to find something that I love
in there it makes me feel really
confident with what I'm wearing day to
day and I also think my style it really
reflects my personality so hopefully
this video will help you achieve
something similar and I've broken it
down into three main areas so the first
thing to do is take a look at your
existing wardrobe pull all of your
pieces out and think about what are the
pieces that you love the most that
you're drawn to the most and that of
course you wear the most chances are
these are the building blocks that
really represent the personal style you
already love and have in your wardrobe
now this could be your most worn items
perhaps it's a really well-loved black
leather biker jacket or it could be a
skirt that you know always completes
your outfit and you always feel fabulous
in or maybe it's something with design
details that really reflect those
different parts of your personality for
me personally it's probably this jumper
I got this about 18 months ago in Club
Monaco and for me this is the piece that
really represents my personal style it's
quite a good quality piece I invested in
this jumper so it's lasted really well
and as soon as I saw it in the shop I
was like that that is me in a jumper
it's pink which is my favorite
as you can probably tell it's got some
beautiful ruffle details on it which are
really really feminine and it's just a
gorgeous elegant timeless piece so this
would be the one thing in my wardrobe
that I would say truly represents my
personal style so put that one garment
to the side and also then have a look at
the pieces that you really enjoy wearing
now these could be things in your
wardrobe that you feel really
comfortable in when you wear them you
feel great you feel full of confidence
and chances are those pieces also
represent your personal style it could
be a gorgeous chunky knit jumper it
could be a pair of jeans that really
flatters your shape but those pieces to
the side as well and slowly you should
start to build a picture of what
personal style you already have
represented in your wardrobe I would say
that having an efficient and organized
wardrobe is really important when it
comes to finding and showing off your
personal style so for more tips on that
check out my video how to update your
wardrobe for 2018 I'll leave that linked
up on the screen and also down below so
I have a watch of that one next for more
tips on how to organize your wardrobe
having personal style icons is really
really useful when it comes to finding
your own signature style now this could
be found on Pinterest or it could be
celebrities or from Instagram they could
be bloggers youtubers fashion bloggers
but I find that having a few people in
my head really helps me when it comes to
finding inspiration for my own personal
style so spend some time browsing on
Instagram I like to follow accounts such
as the liked a new account which shows
loads of different fashion bloggers
outfits and when you find people that
signature style is similar to your own
or similar to the style that you want to
portray click follow and then maybe add
to your favorites save down any images
of outfits that you think yes that is
totally me that is absolutely the style
that I want to portray add them to
folders in Instagram now you can not
only save your favorite images but add
them to folders I have a whole folder on
my phone for outfit inspiration and when
I'm shopping or when I'm putting
together outfits for my own wardrobe
that is what I reach for time and time
again having these style icons in the
back of your head is really useful also
when you're shopping or when you're
having a wardrobe clear out what I like
to do sometimes so for example my style
icon I would say is Julia Engel from the
very popular blog girl meets clam
sometimes when I'm shopping and if I'm
coming and are about something
then I'll think to myself would Julia
buy this or would Julia wear this so
when you're shopping and just look at an
item and say would this person wear this
would my style icon wear this how would
they style it would it work in their
wardrobe and if the answer is yes then
perhaps it'll work for your personal
style too once you've got a few
screenshots or a few pictures saved from
people whose style you admire have a
look across the board and think are
there any similarities try and put some
keywords to these stars you really like
are they super feminine are they super
edgy bohemian try to find the common
words that would describe all of these
items maybe there aren't any common
trends perhaps it's more of a common
color are they all super chic black
outfits or are they all really whimsical
pastel colors it sounds kind of obvious
but by labeling the styles that you
really like it can also help you finding
your own signature style as well as
these reoccurring trends also have a
look at any reoccurring details this can
also be really useful to have in your
head when you're shopping for new items
perhaps it's the details like I don't
know fluted sleeves that you really like
or scalloped edges maybe it's
embellishment maybe it's leather detail
once again paying attention to these
really close details that you are
naturally attracted to will help you
when it comes to choosing new items of
figure signature style there's also
nothing to say that you can't be your
own style inspiration when you are doing
a bit of a wardrobe clear out or when
you're getting dressed for a day
shopping with the girlfriends for
example and you put together an outfit
that you're super proud of and that
really represents the style you're
trying to portray just take a photo of
it and add that to your own inspiration
board it might be really useful to have
a folder on your iPhone full of photos
that you've taken they don't need to be
fancy outfit of the day photos just
snapped in your mirror selfie style and
the great thing is these are items that
you already have in your wardrobe so if
you wake up late one morning or you're
just having one of those foggy days when
you can't think of anything to wear you
can refer to that folder for inspiration
of outfits that you know you have in
your wardrobe that are absolutely
beautiful and already perfectly put
together and then the final section
which I would argue is the most
important is how to find your signature
pieces when it comes to having a strong
personal style there will likely be some
key pieces in your wardrobe that truly
represent that style that you want to
portray these are pieces that you'll
find yourself reaching for time and time
again they'll work with so many outfits
and they will be
building blocks for your signature style
outfit so hopefully chances are if
you're watching this video you quite
like my personal style so I thought it
might be quite useful to go through a
few pieces in my wardrobe which I think
truly represents my signature style and
I'm going to briefly mention why I think
they are so representative of my style
I've already mentioned the Club Monaco
jumper something else I would say really
represents my style is this coat which I
bought recently from Rhys
now Rhys is obviously a premium high
street retailer the price points are
slightly higher than your average High
Street store like Topshop or River
Island but that would actually be one of
my tips if there are signature pieces
that really do sum up your style then
don't be afraid to invest a little more
in them chances are these the pieces
you'll be wearing time and time again
the great thing about having a signature
style is that chances are you're going
to love this style for years and years
to come
which means investment pieces like this
you're going to keep wearing year after
year after year to make splurging on
slightly more premium pieces all the
more worthwhile when you are analyzing
your wardrobe and thinking about the
pieces that you have worn the most these
could be a really good option for you
when it comes to investing in a higher
quality version of those pieces for
example I knew that I wear suede skirts
a lot they really are a key part of my
signature style especially in spring and
autumn those kind of transitional months
this is one of my more affordable suede
skirts this one is from ASOS I also have
suede skirts from Topshop River Island
and places like this but this year when
refreshing my 2018 wardrobe I thought to
myself okay I know that suede skirts are
part of my signature style I know that I
reach for them time and time again so
I'm going to invest and this year just
recently I invested in this new skirt
also from Rhys Rhys is one of my go-to
retailers when it comes to my signature
style and this was a higher price point
suede skirt but because I know that I'll
be wearing this time and time again and
I know that so many of my key kind of
signature go-to outfits feature suede
skirt I just know that this will be a
great core piece for my wardrobe another
style of outfit that's very recurring
when it comes to my personal style is
midi skirts and fine knits so I decided
recently to invest in this skirt from
Ted Baker of course it is my signature
pink color which I know that I've loved
for so many years and I'm going to love
for many years in the future and it is a
slightly more premium version of
the miniskirts that I have in my
existing wardrobe because midi skirts
and knitter jumpers have been something
that I've been wearing for so long I
already have lots of tops lots of shoes
and accessories it will already go with
this piece so again it's gonna fit
really seamlessly into my wardrobe
naturally your signature style is
probably going to be a little bit more
timeless but it is also fun to add some
trends into your wardrobe as well just
to given lots of them you don't need to
be head-to-toe dressed in a trend but
instead finding trends that work for
your signature style so for that reason
I really love the trend last year and
this season of adding interesting
textures to your wardrobe so I found
this beautiful juillet which is actually
in the sale at the moment in Club Monaco
and I thought this is a really great way
of adding that textured trend to my
signature style it's something that
really works in my style it's beautiful
neutral color it is a timeless and
quality piece but really adds that
on-trend nod to my outfits so I guess
the main takeaway when it comes to
finding your signature pieces is
trusting that you're going to have the
signature style for many many years to
come and not being afraid to invest in
those pieces that you know will be the
cool building blocks of your wardrobe
you'll be wearing at time and time again
you'll find that having at these good
qualities staple fashion items in your
wardrobe makes choosing an outfit on a
daily basis so much easier and after
doing a little bit of research you'll
probably have a few retailers in your
head that become your go-to retailers
when it comes to picking up those pieces
that really work for your style for me I
would say they are of course Reis Club
Monaco Ted Baker Kate Spade these all
retail as I go to and I'm pretty
confident that they're going to have
pieces that match my signature look so I
really hope you found this video useful
