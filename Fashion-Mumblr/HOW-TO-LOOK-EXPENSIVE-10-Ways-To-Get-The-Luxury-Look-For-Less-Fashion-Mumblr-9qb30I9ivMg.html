video this is actually my first standing
up video it's a little bit weird that
I'm just going to roll it so today I'm
going to be sharing a few tips on how to
get luxury look for that so how to make
your whole wardrobe look a little bit
more high-end a little bit more pulled
together but without breaking the bank
and I've pulled it down into ten steps
or ten tips so without further ado let's
get started my third tip is to keep your
wardrobe neutral and this will come as
no surprise to a lot of you because I do
get a lot of comments on how my wardrobe
pretty much just have one color palette
but this is actually a real benefit when
it comes to having a more high-end and
luxury looking wardrobe personally I
find shade such as white and blush pink
really make an outfit look a little bit
more chic a little bit more polished and
definitely more luxury than if you were
to have loads of different colors thrown
in there load the patterns I find the
plain pieces just look a whole lot more
hand down the package pieces as a whole
one piece in particular that really sums
this up is this dress that I have from
Topshop this is a plain white dress it
cost less than 50 pounds but when paired
with the right accessories it just looks
so luxurious it could definitely be a
Pucci or something designer
along those lines it is the most
beautiful drink fabric it's a very
elegant simple cut at timeless pieces as
well but a really great piece from high
street to make your wardrobe look a
little bit more luxurious so it's not
just black white and grey that counts as
neutrals for me pink also counts as a
neutral color and I like to inject pink
in a few different shades into my
wardrobe this means that a lot of my
pieces a lot of my garments mix and
match together really well which also
means you can invest in pewter pieces
knowing you can get more outfits for
your return not as discovered this
particular blouse is actually from Ray's
but I'm just imagining going to places
like hmmm alright you can pick up
browsers like this for a fraction of the
cost of this one personally I chose to
invest in one like this because it is
such a classic and I wear this with so
many outfits as you all know if you've
seen my previous look so
at stores such as Zara mango Topshop
River Island the occurrence obtained
silky dials are always coming into store
and now such traffic pieces and I find
that people are very plain and simple
very payload always met you out there
the promotional client another way of
making your outfit look a lot more
expensive is by choosing very simple
delicate jewelry I have a couple of
brands and I just go to again again on a
regular basis and they are you guys do
it Monica villager and up stratum you
there are a little bit more expensive
than high street brands but because they
are so timeless and classic I feel like
I've invested in one of pieces and I
just wear them so often that the price
to wear is actually really really good
when it comes to choosing the style I've
gone for really timeless pieces this is
my cuff that I wear 90% at the time I
have very simple chain necklaces very
simple bracelet they're very elegant
very timeless and by investing in a few
key pieces that means I'm actually
saving money in the long run instead of
buying loads and loads of haiji pieces
I'd like to keep it delicate and simple
I find it looks a lot more feminine a
lot more elegant instead of growing big
bold jewelry of really overpowered your
entire outfit tip number three from
making your wardrobe look more high-end
is by investing in entry level designer
pieces and I don't necessarily mean an
she-devil handbags although we're coming
onto that in a few moments that will be
even more affordable accessories
turns on what your style is a lot of
people look incredible in things like
designer belts but gucci belt of course
we saw all over instagrams over the past
six to eight months and then of course
there's things such as design scars I
think it's fabulous when girls by for
example is doing it on scarf wrap it
around a handle of their handbag but
personally they're just not trans I've
invested in yet for me I am a sunglasses
girl I love to find sunglasses and my
favorite is numu and these are my most
recent power-up you love them and I find
it as having something a little bit
high-end such as a pair of designer
sunglasses really helps to elevate the
outfit of the day however of course
there are some amazing country
alternatives you don't even need to
spend hundreds of cars on sunglasses I
find Topshop at least mushy when it
comes to sunglasses this is my latest
purchase from Topshop and
again I feel like these are so design
inspired look slick is very Fendi and I
always go to Topshop ahead of my son
holidays to pick up some a designer
inside sunglasses tip number four
following on from the last one is
knowing where to invest and for me
personally its bags primarily and also
shoes even if your whole outfit is
affordable from the hydrate you can
still make it look absolutely fabulous
and very very high-end by being very
selective with your accessories one of
my favorite purchases of all time is
this Valentino I think it's called the
glam lock rock stone handbag so I got
this from Farfetch'd probably about a
year ago now and I just feel like it
looks so fabulous with loads and loads
of different outfit combinations it's
very obviously designer because it's a
very classic Valentino style and that
would be a tip just to go with something
that's a very classic style when it
comes to investing handbags I don't like
to buy hundreds and hundreds of handbags
I wish I had mine too but I don't
so I'd like to go for more classic
styles which won't be going in and out
of ten anytime soon this is so timeless
but it'll be on trend for years to come
a lot of time bags
I always feel the great pair of shoes
really elevates an outfit and my first
designer shoe purchase was in fact this
pair of Valentino rock studs I think
I've told the story about these quite a
few times on my channel but custome it's
short I basically bought these as a
treat to myself for my graduation and I
have never regret this purchase they are
the concierge designer shoes or just
shoot in general but I have ever owned
I call them my running shoes which my
friends always ask me for but they also
concrete I feel that I could do and
marketing them so much so in fact that
these are totally battered I learned so
much they really need to be healing but
no copy will do to me and all Valentino
and with me but I think that another
pair because I wear these ones so much
so I picked up a gold pair and I just
feel that these instantly elevates any
outfit of all designer shoes I would
highly recommend brandy rock stars
because instantly your Topshop dress
even Primark stress can just look
absolutely fabulous and a lot more
luxurious than it may be I also push the
boat out and bought some flat designer
shoes these a Nicholas card would not
going to lie I just totally was smitten
with these when I saw them I absolutely
love the silver pearl detail
they're so beautiful but this is another
pair of shoes that instantly
about my outfit and makes it look a lot
more designer but what I wanted to say
is what do all of those three pairs of
shoes have in common
general Amazon they all have pointy toes
and I'm feel that pointy toes is
something that makes your shoes look a
lot more high-end so so with that in
mind the next pair of shoes that I want
to show you for elevating your outfit is
this pair from River Island pointed toe
shoes as a whole I think is a great way
of lifting a look but these in
particular I think look so so high-end
so just having that little magpie eye
for High Street pieces such as this is a
really good tactic to have tip number
five would be to choose timeless style
and this is relevant for those high
street pieces and design pieces but
especially designer pieces because you
want to make sure you can wear your
investment piece time and time again so
things again like the Valentino rock
stars they've been around for so long
that the style is not going away and you
are equally this guy rocks the badge is
an absolute timer speed and then the
things like return shows really fun fun
glasses they have not changed in style
in like 20 years
combing my wrong but these starters do
not change so by investing in those
you're going to get so much return on
your way and that's homeless appeal will
just make your whole outfit look a whole
lot more elevated tip number six for
making your whole look look more
luxurious is having neutral makeup and
polish nails with me it means not having
to have your eye makeup
having a pretty pink and fairly natural
lipstick and just a very nude color I've
pretty much always have something new to
my nails this now but I've actually had
quite a few questions that recently it
is the Sally Hansen
argan oil powder room nail brush I'm a
huge fan I think it's just very elegant
very time has been very luxurious so a
neutral makeup finding in lipstick
shades not too bold
however having said that red red lips
destroys a bit outfit that's I mean
keeping a neutral keeping it soft just
makes you look a whole lot more
expensive tip number seven is all about
garment care so you could buy a Marc
Jacobs t-shirt but if you wear it
outside or crinkle and it got threads
hanging from it then it's going to look
rubbish whereas if you go to the
hydrogen you pick up a really affordable
H&amp;amp;M new shirt and yet
usually crispy ions then you're gonna
look a whole lot better so that's all my
pip is looking after your garment
whether that's just regularly ironing or
even scheming or photos so then also
when it comes to winter you may have to
have a few gadgets this is art my
gadgets and they are and you can call a
father very funny name that I can't
remember right now but yeah this
basically pull all the fluff off your
jumpers they don't get bubbly and then
this is just a soft way of doing it you
can buy knees think I probably got them
from Amazon's grants but definitely
worth investing in key to knit we're
looking at fast during the winter if you
live in a house with dogs or cats then
you'll know that your clothes can get
pretty hairy so I definitely recommend
investing in some lint rollers I'm so
investing these in 1990 from hmm that's
so time you can pop them in your handbag
let's give your outfit quick once-over
with a lint roller before you step
outside it's definitely an instant way
of making a look look a whole lot more
animated certain things in your wardrobe
is always going to be timeless fashion
essentials and oil makeup outfit look a
lot more luxury such as a trench coat
this one isn't even designer this is
from Ted Baker and Ted Baker for me when
there's premium high street stores a
really good middle ground between high
street and designer where you can invest
and get really lovely quality without
spending thousands of pounds so
investing in things like a trench coat
free jackets and leather jackets
those kinds of things they come in two
styles season after season so you can
invest a little bit more knowing you're
going to get along as where for your
investments but having said that you
don't necessarily need buy the most
expensive options that's available or
this is a really good example I have a
Reese way jacket but I also have to
River is very jacket
cousins prefer the river island once I
really feel like my outfit looks a lot a
lot of trees when I wear these just
because they're so well made the quality
of the fabric is really lovely and yet
they were under sixty pounds so they
definitely didn't break the bank tip
number nine and this is quite an obvious
one being one make sure your clothes fit
no size and make sure that you don't go
too small so nothing was and having
fabric cleaning where I should not be
clinging equally if you're a whiz on a
sewing machine it makes a whole lot of
different route that if you can just do
a little tuck here maybe it's taking me
the maybe is taking the straps up maybe
it's taking the waste in a little bit
but just very subtly tearing up codes
can make them look a whole lot expensive
if the stretch is absolutely perfect and
my final tip will come as no surprise
and it is to invest in designer dupes
so for me I have no issue at all
whatsoever with buying tubes in fact I
think it's a really wise decision for
making it outfit look a lot more than
serious when you're on a budget exhibit
a is my Gucci mules these will actually
I think around the 20 pound mark from
ego I absolutely love them I was
intrigued that they buy the mule fur
trend but I didn't want to spend
hundreds and hundreds of pounds on the
trend because I know that this time next
year no one is going to want to be seen
wearing them and by investing in the
juice I get to experience a trend
without breaking the bank
these are my M s sandals again that
these were less than 20 pounds I don't
think I'd ever spend that kind of money
on a pair of sandals but let's be honest
you're going to wear to the beach but
behind the juice again I can enjoy the
chain I can get our luxury look but
without spending a fortune
another example is another pair that I
picked up recently I absolutely love
this style unfurl they're obviously very
much inspired by Valentino and I wants
to buy into the trend but without
spending a fortune so if these 1 bucks
and then finally these little shoes from
Topshop which they have just released in
white and yes I have ordered them they
very much have the vibe of Chanel shoes
but the price tag is less than a tenth
of the Chanel ones so you have high
street views when it comes to shoes are
absolutely fabulous of course when it
comes to designer dupes there are some
incredible which is handbags out there
this is one of my favorites which you
may recognize from my Chelsea Flower
Show lookbook but also my mango bag
which was a little bit inspired by the
Chloe Niall handbag not again with the
handbag that I was a little bit unsure
do I want to invest in it do I not but
by buying the jute almost acts as like a
test front as to whether you want to go
whole hog and buy the designer version
or not so those are my top 10 tips for
getting a luxury it looks a mess I
