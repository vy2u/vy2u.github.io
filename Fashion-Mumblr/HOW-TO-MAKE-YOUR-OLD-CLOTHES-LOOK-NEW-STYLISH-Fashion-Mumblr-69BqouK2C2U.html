joining me for another fashion video
today's video is really exciting
something a little bit different I'm
going to be talking about how to take
your old clothes and make them look and
feel new make them look stylish make
them relevant for today's trends and a
few little hacks on changing your
mentality when you shop so that you
don't have the issue of having nothing
to wear and feeling like all your
clothes are out-of-date
so I have quite a lot of fun researching
this video I typed into the YouTube
search box and how to make it old
clothes look new again I wanted to see
what else was out there and oh my
goodness
there were so many crazy DIYs so let me
tell you what this video is not going to
be I'm not going to be telling you to do
we're little cutting snipping jobs on
your t-shirts to make them really cool
and edgy with little holes for your
thumbs I'm not going to be telling you
to snip holes in your old fluffy socks
to make them into gloves and hand
warmers these are honestly things that I
found and I was researching this video
so this video is not going to be
anything like that this is going to be a
lot more refined and how to genuinely
make your old clothes look new and
stylish again having joked about those
crazy hacks I am going to start with two
or three DIYs and then we're gonna move
past the DIYs because let's be honest
they're often quite tragic the first DIY
I think is really obvious so I'm just
going to skip through it really quickly
we all have an old favorite pair of
jeans that fit us around the booty
really nicely they just are dreamy but
maybe they've got a little bit rough
around the edges at the bottom maybe
they're just no longer looking they're
the most stylish self the easiest thing
you can possibly do is cut the bottoms
don't be afraid to just get a big pair
of sewing scissors any sharp pair of
scissors and hack away because let's be
honest right now our jeans are a little
bit's coffee around the edges jeans that
are a little bit cropped with a raw hem
are all the style so if you do have a
pair of old skinny jeans that you want
to update then just get a pair of sewing
scissors pull a few threads to make them
loose you don't need to finish the edges
off I did these a couple of months ago
and they've been in the washer a few
times which makes them even more scruffy
so
yeah a very very easy DIY to do if you
have a pair of black jeans side notes
and you want to make them all black it's
really easy to dye your own jeans so
just buy I think it's dylon you can just
shove that into the washing machine and
make your black pair even blacker if
they do go a little bit gray that's
another easy tip and something else you
can do with the hems of your jeans is
create a step hem so step hem is where
it's a little bit longer at the back
that's really on trend right now so you
could just create a little bit of a
shelf in the top section and then make
your jeans even more stylish a crazy
trend that we're starting to see this
summer is also pedal pushers that brings
me back to my childhood and I never
thought the pill pushers would come back
into fashion again they are jeans that
finish or are they long shorts either
just above or just below the knee they
look a little bit dorky I'm not going to
lie but they are very much on trend so
again if you have a pair of skinny jeans
and white or pastel pink or even denim
then try copying them even shorter and
you'll be nailing the pedal pretty trend
if you have an old handbag that needs
updating or you just want to make it
feel new and fresh again then why not
take a little scarf this one I
absolutely adore it's so multifunctional
this one is from Reese it is silk scarf
and tight around the handle you can
either do a very casual little tie along
the side just like so and this is a
really good way of incorporating new
trends into your classic things say you
wanted to take part in the blush pink
trend but you didn't want to invest in a
whole new blush pink handbag just get a
blush pink scarf and that's an instant
way to update an old bag and make it
feel new and fresh again it's also
really good if you are packing for a
capsule wardrobe for a holiday perhaps I
packed my little straw bag for our trip
to the Maldives and I was wearing it in
every single photo so I just took the
scarf that I was wearing around my head
wrapped around the side for a couple of
days wrapped it around the top handle
for a couple of other days and I just
totally transformed it and made it not
the same bag every single time even
though it was so this is one way to do
it or if you want to update it even
further then you could wrap it all the
way around the top handle
there we go
super super easy to do and can
potentially just give your old handbag a
whole new look particularly as this silk
scarf around the handle is very much on
trend at the moment if you've got any
classic bags this one's not actually old
it's from El cabinet but it's just using
this to demonstrate my point but this is
a really easy way of making an old
classic bag look and feel new and
stylish again
so those are my DIYs there's obviously
some really easy and obvious things that
every magazine YouTube video will
recommend to you things like changing
the buttons dropping off sleeves there
are a lot of DIYs you can play around
with if you have got a cheap trench coat
or dress that has some not very nice
buttons that is actually a really good
thing to do but other than that I don't
do too many DIYs other than taking up
hands which i think is really easy and
simple and doesn't look now so now I'm
going to share more tips as opposed to
DIYs and my first tip is to have a
spring summer wardrobe and an autumn
winter wardrobe and what I like to do is
pack away the clothes that are not in
season at the moment for a few different
reasons the first reason is that it
allows you to have a lot more room in
your wardrobe so you can see a lot more
clearly what you have and therefore if
you do have some real gems from previous
years you're less likely to forget about
them because they're more visible and
you can really make them most of them
the second reason is because what is so
lovely about bringing down your new
season but actually all season clothes
is that you feel like you're shopping
your own wardrobe if you've been clever
with your original shopping and I'm
going to talk about curvy shopping
mentality shortly then it'll be like
shopping clothes but for free because
you already own them and that is
absolutely amazing I think I actually
did a video on this yes I did I did a
video on updating my wardrobe for spring
where I did exactly that I bought my
clothes
it's my spring/summer clothes down from
the loft took them out of their vacuum
pack bags took them out of their
suitcases gave them a steam and they
looked fresh and new and because I've
been wise when I was buying those
clothes originally I'd gone for classic
items that I knew I'd loved for years
and years to come it was just like
having a whole new wardrobe but actually
I'd own the
thirty years so moving on from that tip
I am just going to talk briefly about
the mentality when it comes to shopping
now this isn't going to help you right
now when it comes to making your old
clothes limping you again unless you've
had this mentality for a few years but
it is unsurprisingly investing in
quality classic pieces I feel like a
stuck record and I know I talk about it
all the time on my channel but I really
think it's so important to have a base
wardrobe of quality classic timeless
pieces I'm gonna give some examples of
where for me that has really paid off
now bear in mind that if I was in my
early 30s I probably have a lot more
examples to show you and I'd have a lot
older examples to show you but I only
started investing in quality pieces when
I was about 20 21 and I'm now 25 or 26
I'm in my mid-20s at the moment so I've
only been investing in good quality
pieces for the past four or five years
because before that I couldn't afford it
so I just shop from Primark Miss
Selfridge Topshop that was about as as
far as it went
however since I started investing in
quality basics the pieces that I bought
even four or five years ago are still in
my wardrobe to this day making it so
easy to pick out pieces year after year
and they still look fabulous let me show
you some examples this was probably the
first really expensive thing that I
bought with my first paycheck I used to
work at Reese in the store so I did get
I think a 40% staff discount on this
this I purchased I think four years ago
Reese don't even make labels like this
anymore like this is old school old
school Reese but probably if I really
looked back have a picture of me trying
this on in the changing room and
actually the white dress that I wore in
that picture
I still have as well Reese is one of
those retailers that is great for
investment pieces I'd never get rid of
anything that I have from Reese because
they're so timeless this I just the
quality is absolutely gorgeous
I don't wear many leather jackets I
don't really wear a lot of black so for
me a brown leather jacket oh my goodness
I just absolutely adore it and now that
I tried it on again I'm gonna get even
more use out of this so something like
this when it comes to a wardrobe staple
in
to invest invest invest because the
quality is there it lasts you a lifetime
something else that has been in my
wardrobe for a long time is this it's a
gain from Reiss it's a beautiful little
flared skirt if anybody has any of these
things by the way that I'm showing from
years ago then let me know that would be
bonkers if we both have these four or
five year old items but once again for
me buying this was a real it was a real
huge investment and also a bit like oh
my god I don't know if I don't if I'm
gonna wear it enough but because it's
such good quality it still looks
brand-new and I'm going to give you some
tips on keeping things looking brand new
next because of that and because it's
very classic beautifully made I still
wear this to this day it's quite
autumnal but how I style it up now is
with a new jumper and you blouse I could
even wear it with something like I'm
wearing now so mixing the older than you
but more of the story is because I
invested it still looks fabulous
even a year's on you don't always have
to go to these premium high street
retailers to get great quality this is a
bit of a throwback piece this is a suede
skirt from ASOS and this was actually
featured in my very first a sauce haul
on YouTube I think it's actually in the
thumbnail if I can find it I'll insert a
picture here the only thing wrong with
this is that a button at the top is
about to fall off really easy to repair
I can do that in a few moments but this
was this was fairly pricey for ASIS the
thickness is around 70 or 80 pounds but
when it comes to choosing good quality
pieces that are staples in your wardrobe
that you want to last years and years
always look at the material materials
that are long-lasting such as suede good
quality leather and then also materials
that are a little bit more fragile such
as silks they are going to maintain that
beautiful look and feel throughout the
years but they just need a little bit
more care for them this I knew was a
really good quality piece
I think ASOS especially a sauce owned
brand which this is can be a little bit
hit-and-miss but that's where their
return service comes in very handy this
as soon as I open it up I could feel
there was really good quality suede so I
knew it'd be a keeper and that if it was
one of my first holes that would have
been about three years ago not ancient I
know but it just shows that the quality
it really does stand the test of time
some other pieces again from Reece I
have the
silk t-shirt because it was from Rhys
it's very well made very classic there's
nothing very striking about this it's
just a very simple basic piece never
going to about style so another great
investment pieces I wear over and over
again and then I also wanted to show you
something from this year's resection
this video is not sponsored by Rhys that
is something that I've actually bought
this year in the knowledge that it is a
plastic piece that's not going to go out
of style in two five ten years and our
price still be wearing this in my 40s as
a mum hopefully because it's such a good
quality piece so it's not too late to
invest in those classic items and other
than tops things like knitwear always
good to invest in slightly higher price
point knitwear this is a cashmere
cardigan from next again a very classic
really good quality and I've worn this
for three or four winters now I would
say that investing in quality classic
pieces is even more important when it
comes to outerwear because it's the
first thing people see when they meet
you when they look at you and I think
good-quality outerwear is always worth
the investment a couple more examples
this is a Ted Baker trench coat that I
got a couple of years ago it's still
absolutely love it the only detail is
the black piping around the lining
trench coats I mean one day hopefully
I'll own a beverage ranch coat like this
because it's never going to go out of
style you can get so much use out of it
the quality ensures that it stands the
test of time and it always looks super
and then there are also things that are
a little bit more stylish and just going
to pop this down and then there's pieces
like this which is again from Rhys this
is a slightly more lilac colored trench
coat and the reason why I wanted to
share this one is because brands like
Rhys will often bring back classic
pieces like this year after year this I
purchased a couple of years ago but they
actually bought something almost
identical to this out this year so
because I've taken good care of this I
take it to the dry cleaners at the end
of each season it still looks as good as
new and it still looks almost identical
to something that's in the stores right
now to demonstrate that point further I
have two different jumpers from French
Connection this is very typical of
premium high street stores they often
bring back winning products year after
year they just make slight design
details now if I show
- this jumper with a floral sleeve
detail and this jumper with the floral
sleeve detail would you know which one
is the 2018 version and which one is a
2016 or 17 version probably not because
it looks so so similar this one is the
2018 version I feature this on quite a
lot I absolutely loved the old version
so I thought why not to get an upgrade
but I really didn't need to I could have
just worn this one the old one
throughout this season it would have
been very much on trend very similar to
what was in the stores at the moment and
again because I took really good care of
it it still looks good as new so I feel
like those pieces demonstrate the point
of investing in quality basics quality
pieces and I did save quite a few times
throughout that that they are still
looking great because I've taken really
good care of them
so a few very quick tips I am actually
going to do an entire video on how I
care for my clothes because you guys
asked for it so much and I promise you
it is coming but a few tips don't be
afraid to go to the dry cleaner if you
do invest in a 200 pound coat then it's
such a shame to have it not looking its
best I always think that you can buy a
Topshop coat you can buy a Primark coat
and if you take good care of it it'll
look so much better than someone else
who spends thousands of pounds on a
Burberry coat but doesn't take good care
of it if you're walking around in some
increased a little bit mucky with
foundation around the neckline that's
never going to look new and stylish
whereas if you were to take your high
street or your premium high street coat
to the dry cleaners it can be maybe 30
pounds but it look fabulous for the rest
of the season another thing that I use
to keep my old clothes
and my new clothes looking great is my
steamer this is my best friend my
Phillips Steven go I absolutely love
this I find it very quick and easy to
just make clothes that are either worn
or they've come out of storage look
fresh again this video is not sponsored
by Philips but I did actually work with
them on a blog post and within that blog
post I have a discount code for this so
I'll leave that linked down below but
this is particularly fabulous in fact I
use this when I did that video where I
bought my spring/summer stuff down from
the loft and just instantly freshens
things up the steam also kills bacteria
because of the heat
so it's a great way of making things
look and feel really clean and fresh and
new again so definitely recommend
investing in a steamer to keep your
wardrobe looking its best
also again I'll go into this more in the
video about caring for your clothes but
just making sure that you're reading the
care instructions washing your delicates
separately my washing machine has a hand
wash setting specifically for silks and
Kashmir's and things like that so just
use that if you have a boyfriend that
likes to or girlfriends that likes to
scoop everything out the wash basket and
show it on the machine
maybe just have a little drawstring bag
where you keep your more delicate pieces
there's no chance of anything going
bubbly or getting shredded in the wash
so another tip for making your old
clothes look and feel new and stylish is
having a really fun afternoon or morning
of trying things on often we've seen
these we see things in our wardrobe and
we remember how we start them back in
2012 2015 and so we have kind of a bad
image of them in our heads it's only
when we put these pieces on that we
remember why we love them so much why
the fit was so great how they made us
feel and then try these old pieces on
with your new pieces is a great way to
fall back in love with your old favorite
items like that we'll have a jacket I
actually haven't pulled that out of my
wardrobe in probably over a year and I
just forgot how great it looked and how
great it made me feel and even just
trying it on for the camera in front of
you guys now I know that I'm going to be
pulling that out the next time I have an
event where it's going to be a bit
chilly in the evenings I will be wearing
it so it sounds silly and you're
probably like I don't need to do that
but it makes such a difference actually
trying your things on try it with other
old things try it with new things order
some stuff in go do an sshole do a
Topshop whole mix and match old with new
always makes your outfit feel fresh
again something else I'd recommend when
you're doing this is when you find a
winning outfit take a snap in the mirror
take a selfie and have an album on your
phone of these outfits that will serve
as inspiration if you're having one of
those mornings when you have nothing to
wear just go to that album in your phone
and you'll be full of so many ideas
thanks to that one afternoon maybe
coffee fueled where you just try
everything on and put together loads of
great outfits with all the new clothes
alike and then lastly it's all about
taking inspiration so again
kind of obvious but just scrolling
through Instagram saving outfits you
love say you have a suede skirt and
they're totally coming back in this
autumn I can feel it I absolutely love
my suede skirts so you've got a suede
skirts and you're not sure how to start
it to make it look cool for the existing
season just go through the Instagram go
through Pinterest type in suede skirt
also on the likes knowit app which is an
app which is basically shoppable
Instagram amazing I'll leave it link
down below you can now search for
particular products so you could type
into the app suede skirt and you can see
all of these bloggers celebrities
stylish people styling up their suede
skirt something that you've got in your
wardrobe and it might just give you an
idea you might actually have the other
pieces that this person is wearing or
something very similar in your wardrobe
or you might want to treat yourself to
one or two new things that you can get
that look and make your old item look
and feel very new and stylish again so
