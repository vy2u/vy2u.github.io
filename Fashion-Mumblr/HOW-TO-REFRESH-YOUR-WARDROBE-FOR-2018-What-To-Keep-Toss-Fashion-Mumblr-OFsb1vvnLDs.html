me for today's video
today I'm going to be talking about a
few ways that we can refresh our
wardrobes for 2018 it's a new year so we
don't want to be starting off with a
cluttered wardrobe and let's be honest
it's nice to clear a little bit of space
for those new January sales fines as
well so today we're not going to be
doing a major drastic clear-out just a
few of my tips on how you can really
look at your existing wardrobe think
about the things that probably you're
not going to need in the new year and
how to make space for better new items
you don't want to be starting the new
year with a cluttered wardrobe so I'm
going to be talking through a few of the
trends which you should definitely keep
in your wardrobe and if you have those
pieces which you should definitely get
rid of so it's going to take a little
bit of a keep slash toss format to this
video before I get started don't forget
to hit the subscribe button down below
that way you won't miss out on any of my
future videos and if you love fashion
videos and don't forget to give this one
a thumbs up and as always absolutely
everything that I mentioned this video
from what I'm wearing it's my lipstick -
everything you see here will be linked
down description box so just click show
more for all of the information alright
so the first thing that you need to
think about when looking at your
wardrobe is where things fit you anymore
if they are too small then obviously
there is one reason that you definitely
need to get rid of things obviously a
lot of us over indulge over the
Christmas period and that is totally ok
I absolutely did that myself but if you
haven't fit into things for a little
while then chances are it's time to get
rid of them
the same goes for anything that's really
over worn if anything has got rips or
holes in it it's not a good idea to keep
those kind of things especially for me
when it comes to gym clothes if there's
anything that just looks really worn
then it's time to get rid and make room
for some new pieces on the flip side of
that don't be afraid to keep things that
are a little bit oversized often
oversized pieces especially when it
comes to things like jackets or that
relaxed mom style jeans oversized can be
a really cool look so don't be afraid to
keep a hold of things that might be a
little too big there's always ways of
making them suit your figure such as
bringing a coach or jumper in with a
belt that's actually a look that's very
much on trend the CM or perhaps rolling
up a pair of trousers it's just a little
bit too big on that same kind of topic
if you've got any shoes that have been
sitting in your
wardrobe for months and months maybe
even years because they're really really
beautiful but actually in reality they
hurt and you don't wear them because you
don't want to risk getting loads of
blisters it's time to get rid of them
with all these pieces that you're
getting rid of you can either sell them
of course you can sell them online take
them to a charity shop or even see if
any of your friends will fit them the
next area that you should really look to
clear out is your underwear your sock
drawer your pajamas anything that's old
gained a little bit tatter a little bit
worn get rid of it the thing to do this
year is invest in good quality sleepwear
a good quality lingerie stuff that's
gonna make you feel really good when you
wear it I truly think that if you have
something lovely on underneath it really
impacts how you feel about your whole
outfit so don't be afraid to invest in
good quality lingerie because it really
is the base of every single outfit
personally I've also been getting rid of
loads of old pajamas I don't know why
but I've been tending to hold on to
pajamas for quite a long time so many
sets are just looking a little bit tired
so this year I'm focusing on much better
quality night wear which I feel really
luxurious when I'm wearing it and also
it's going to last a lot longer one of
my favorites is this beautiful set which
actually I was so kindly recently sent
from by Kilian it is their collaboration
with Fleur de Mille and it is this
beautiful scented pajama set it's giving
me a gorgeous waft of fragrance just as
I hold it up so you can imagine how
beautiful it is to wear I've got the
beautiful blush pink color with this
black lace it is by far my favorite
pajama set with these gorgeous little
shorts too as well as Fleur de mal I'm
also a huge fan of Olivia van hull
pajamas they are really expensive but
I'm all about that price per wear as you
guys know and I think you wear them
every single evening so it's well worth
investing in some good quality tonight
wear
now this is one thing I often find
really really hard but take a look at
your wardrobe and think about if there
are any pieces that were really on trend
in 2017 and are they going to be such
big trends in 2018 especially when maybe
it comes to designer pieces are there
any things that you're just not going to
wear this year in which case probably
it's time to move them on to a better
home certain trends will definitely be
overlapping in 2018 as well in fact I
might do a video on trends that have
stood the test of time
let me know in the comments if that is
something that you would like to see but
for example trends that were really big
in 2017 such as maybe teddy bear coats
I'm not sure if they're going to be so
huge in 2018 so have a look at your
wardrobe and think of there's any
on-trend pieces that you're not going to
wear now is the time or to move them on
there's also no point in hanging on to
designer items that you don't really use
one thing that I'm thinking of moving on
is actually my YSL blogger bag this I
bought about eight months ago but to be
honest it's just not practical for me it
doesn't fit my phone in so I very very
rarely find myself actually taking this
out so I'm thinking about selling this
one if you guys know of any good
websites where you recommend selling
second-hand designer things and please
let me know because I haven't actually
sold any designer things before and one
thing that I'd really like to do this
year is when I have a new designer item
on my wish list I'd like to sell the
equivalent value of things in my
existing wardrobe in order to pay for
the new perch it's kind of like a one in
one out system when looking at your
designer bag collection it's important
to have timeless classics in mind though
and these are definitely things to keep
so on the flip side when it comes to YSL
this is one design which i think is one
that is going to last a long time it's a
very very classic and timeless design
and it is my wire sales sunset bag this
bag I probably didn't use as much as I
should have done last year but this year
I'm determined to get way more use out
of it it's a very classic design a
classic color goes with so many things
in my wardrobe and why sell despite the
fact they've gone through so many
different designers in their history
they have always kept this wire sell
logo so I think that this logo on such a
classic design of bag in such a classic
color really makes it stand the test of
time also this particular bag is made of
a croc effect leather which is very
hard-wearing making it great for an
everyday handbag so when looking at your
collection make sure you think about
things that could become a timeless
classic and keep hold of those handbags
the next thing to toss is dated patterns
chances are if a pattern was really on
trend in 2017 it's going to be quite a
few years before that pattern comes back
into trend so it's probably a good idea
to get rid of those pieces sell them or
donate them to make some new room in
your wardrobe again on the flipside the
things to keep would be those classic
patterns things
never seem to go out of fashion such as
animal print and stripes they're just
constantly on trend so keep those safe
in your wardrobe I've never been a huge
fan of full-on leopard prints but this
coat from Mars relevee evolved this has
a very very subtle animal print on it
it's beautiful cozy faux fur and while
it is printed it's not too OTT so I find
this really really versatile and
definitely one that I'll be keeping in
my wardrobe for the next year unlike so
many of my fellow fashion bloggers I'm
not a huge fan of stripes but the few
striped things I do have in my wardrobe
like this I call it my kind of chill-out
top from Club Monaco will definitely be
staying put too because stripes are
another trend that will not be going
away anytime soon another thing to toss
is any outdated costume jewelry such as
sunglasses necklaces earrings if last
year or even the year before people any
affordable jewelry that's really big
release statement chances are it might
be looking a little bit tired by now so
it could be a good time to donate it
also have a look at your sunglasses
collection I'll be getting rid of quite
a few of my more affordable pairs these
are a couple of pairs from Topshop and I
just don't see myself wearing these that
much in 2017 so things like this I'm
going to be tossing I also got very
carried away with the statement earring
trend in 2017 such as these pom pom
earrings I'm not sure I'm quite ready to
get rid of them just yet especially when
I'm wearing a pom pom jumper like this
one but these are just an example of the
kind of very affordable costume jewelry
that a lot of us pick up in places like
Sarah if you feel that you're not going
to wear them right now then chances are
you're not going to be wanting to reach
for them throughout the rest of the year
so it could be a good time to get rid
what you should look to keep so are any
classic pieces I've chosen a few of my
kind of designer sunglasses to
demonstrate this point this is a pair of
Valentino sunglasses got these about
three years ago but they are such a
classic style that I don't see myself
not wanting to wear these any time soon
very subtle todos print with a little
Valentino's stud on the corner there
I'll try to find the most recent edition
or a similar pattern link them down
below equally a more affordable pair of
sunglasses these are from Kate Spade
eyewear I think they're such a classic
design not going to be going out of
style
anytime soon so definitely a
keep and another pair of sunglasses I've
had in my collection for over a year
my Fendi sunglasses this style of
sunglasses
Fendi are still bringing them out with a
little cat eye and the detail on the
point here so I'll be keeping at
timeless styles such as this moving back
to jewelry costume jewelry is also often
really big takes up a lot of room in
your collection room which could be
reserved for more classic timeless
pieces these are the giant leaf earrings
again I think I got these from Zara I
rarely wear them because they're so
heavy they're quite painful on my ears I
do think they had a really nice touch to
my outfit but because I so rarely wear
them I think they're gonna have to go
instead you want to be on the lookout
and keeping hold of any timeless jewelry
Styles you guys know how much I love and
wear Monika vinegar on a daily basis so
many of their designs are absolutely
timeless I bought loads these pieces
years and years ago and they are still
on their website they are still being
worn and they are absolute classic
investment pieces one of which is the
rever ring with the little diamonds in
it I love this it's an everyday wear
ring seriously beautiful one very
classic their linear bracelets there are
so many different designs once you can
get personalized like the one that I
wear with a hundred thousand engraved on
there ones with little evil eye or
diamonds on the toggle again they can
very easily be personalized which makes
them even more special I'm gonna add
this one and wear it for the rest of the
day and their signature bracelets these
I was not 100% sold on to begin with but
the more I wore it the more I absolutely
fell in love and this again has become a
real classic style I get a lot of
questions on the exact one that I have
so I will leave this exact one linked
down in the description box and also the
blog post that I did talking about
jewelry investment pieces and then
finally on the accessories front if
there are any watches that you bought in
2016 or 2017 they were looking a little
bit tired maybe they were more trend
Watchers and perhaps it's time to get
rid of those but you want to be keeping
any of your more investment watches
smart watches once again my Michael Kors
SmartWatch this is going to be something
I will cherish throughout 2018 as well
timeless designs such as this you want
to keep a hold of that anything that's
more of a trend piece that's no longer
looking its best time to move it on it
to another home my final tip when it
comes to refreshing of 2018 wardrobe is
have a think about the style that you
want to portray that you want to have
in the ear moving forward do you want to
have maybe a more elegant or a more
timeless style moving forward into 2018
in which case have a look at every
single thing that's left in your
wardrobe after as many clear out and
think is this a kind of style that I
want to have moving forward if the
answer's no then pack it up ready to
donate but if you'll have watched my
fashion videos in 2017 you'll know that
I've always been very Pro timeless and
classic fashion pieces so a lot of the
pieces of my wardrobe are already very
timeless one thing as an example is this
relay from Reese it's just an investment
piece that will last me year after year
because it's not screaming any trends
and yet it always looks timeless it
always looks furious so classic good
quality pieces in your wardrobe along
the same lines of this I would
definitely keep hold of so that's
everything from me for today's video I
really hope you found it useful do let
me know in the comments if you are
planning your very own 2018 wardrobe
refresh let me know if you agree with
these tips or if you have any other
things you think you need to toss all
things you need to keep just let me know

is all from me thank you so much for
