City how to spend three days in the Big
Apple
including the West eat and where to
drink some of my favorite places to shop
where to go for some epic views of the
city and of course those all-important
Instagram hotspots so let's go alright
so first up is the butcher's daughter in
Greenwich Village
you probably recognize the name because
I don't think there's a blogger on earth
who hasn't visited this place but it's a
good reason the breakfast is pretty epic
my fave was there blitz avocado and
their farm boiled eggs
everything here is vegetarian and
farm-fresh while you're downtown explore
around the Bleecker Street area and be
sure to grab a corn flake milkshake from
milk probably my favorite milkshake in
the whole city a rally slides to fire
plenty of places to get that
all-important New York Street style
photo for the gram if you're lucky you
might even find Carrie Bradshaw's helps
from Sex in the City
shopping on Bleecker is one of my
favorite places and when you've worked
up an appetite head to buy Chloe a vegan
cafe with a huge menu and lots of tasty
treats including this mac and cheese
with shiitake mushroom bacon it's nicer
than it sounds a promise the best way to
see NYC is to walk everywhere
so stroll over to so her forget more
shopping and be sure to check out the
side streets too for the best boutiques
and after a long day of exploring we'll
be craving some crabs so head to midtown
for the refinery rooftop for a sculpture
selection of dishes which are great for
sharing and make sure to order the disco
talks trust me you won't regret it
this fabulous cocktails to a spectacular
view on a huge rooftop of the Empire
State Building
rise and shine on day two heads of
Evette
a cozy French restaurant with apparently
the best waffle in the city I have to
admit they were delicious more shopping
next and I like to make the most of the
stores that are cheap in the US and they
are in the UK such as the likes of
anthropology Kate Spade Victoria's
Secret Michael Kors etc sample some
traditional American cuisine in a
sophisticated hot spot that is the 21
club chaps don't forget your Blazers for
this one and be sure to look up the
ceiling is covered in toys that link
back to the famous guest sort of sat
right on a very table scrumptious hearty
dishes and an incredible dessert menu
made for two very happy tourists we
headed to Brooklyn the following day for
brunch at five years this small cafe is
super popular so get here early to
secure your spot another epic ever one
toes for me and a healthier option to
charge
the coffee here was great and I'll peu
by the window made for fantastic people
watching then take a stroll to the
riverbank in Brooklyn for great views of
the Manhattan skyline and keep a lookout
for all the great street art - charlie
was keen to try out a Brooklyn bother we
stumbled upon fellow barber which turns
out that this place is kind of a big
deal and well-groomed gents from all
over the city will happily wait up to
two hours just to get a haircut from the
highly trained hairstylist then hop on
the line to subway to find yourself back
in the heart of Chelsea you must be
hungry again by now right try some
difficulty york pizza or if you're
overwhelmed by all the choice in the
market and why not keep it simple with a
doughnut made at the artisan and donut
erine freshly before your eyes the
flavors here are absolutely incredible
and flower power with hibiscus honey and
rose petal had to be my favorite I may
only not have gone back for seconds
what's the trip to NYC without visiting
Times Square yes it's super touristy but
it's worth it just so you've seen it
dinner at Gallo green is quite the
experience
the restaurant is set in the New York
loft style rooftop very cool with
amazing views again at the Empire State
Building the table is set with an old
train carriage and be sure to dry the
cocktails they're pretty strong with
sharing able to start and then a
delicious hearty burger for your name
you definitely won't leave hungry this
place makes for the perfect spot for
dinner and drinks with a group of
friends
and you'll feel like a true New Yorker
here it's definitely not one you'd
stumble upon by accident if you go in
the daytime a train track on the roof
for the floral artists would make for an
epic Instagram photo as well for your
final breakfast in the Big Apple it's
got to be the instagramers favorite
Jack's wife Freda it can get super busy
on weekends so try a weekday if you can
and good heavens you must try the rose
water waffle I felt like I died and gone
to heaven just say I'm Charlie's pink
eggs Danny looks pretty epic - then try
a look at Dominic and stills bakery to
try the legendary cronut but we weren't
so lucky all sold out with a three-hour
wait the next batch when in NYC don't be
afraid of getting the subway it's a
little bit confusing at first but you
get the hang of it we hopped aboard to
make our way uptown
to enjoy the shops and the incredible
vistas from Central Park
spend an hour also strolling through the
park to the map where if you're lucky
you might spot the familiar face wait a
sec is that Anna Wintour oh snap she saw
me I need a cocktail the most photogenic
place for drinks and dinner has to be
while we were young we visited twice and
I couldn't resist reordering the
something fruity with gin cocktail
picture-perfect and delicious
our final dinner was at the pig on
Bleecker where we enjoyed approximately
our 780 fish and mac and cheese of the
trip I would highly recommend it I hope
