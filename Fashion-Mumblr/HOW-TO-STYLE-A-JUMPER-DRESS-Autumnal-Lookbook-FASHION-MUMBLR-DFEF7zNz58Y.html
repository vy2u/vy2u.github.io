going to be a slightly different style
of lookbook because I've never really
introduced a lookbook before but today I
wanted to share with you a few of my
favorite jumper dresses and how I'm
going to be styling them for the
upcoming weeks and months so for me
jumper dresses are pretty much the most
amazing thing you can have in your
wardrobe for autumn because they're an
instant outfit you don't need to worry
about what top to match with what
trousers because your jumper dress is
your entire look all you need to think
about is the accessories which let's be
honest is definitely the most fun part
of an outfit so in this video there's
going to be a few different jumper
dresses ranging in price from 30 pounds
for a cashmere jumper dress I don't even
know how that's possible but it's also
probably my favorite up to just over the
150 pound mark for a really beautiful
one with lovely ruffle detail so without
further ado I'm gonna get started
straight into the lookbook and if you
like anything that you see don't forget
to open up the description box where
you'll find links to absolutely
everything that featured in this video
so let's go
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
