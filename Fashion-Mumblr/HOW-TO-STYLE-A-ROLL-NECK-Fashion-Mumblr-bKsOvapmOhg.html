joining me for a new how-to style video
today we're going to be talking about
the wrong neck or polo neck or
turtleneck if you are from America
they're all the same thing basically a
roll neck is a jumper traditionally very
tight fitting to the body with a roll of
fabric at the neckline whenever you call
them they are a fabulous piece to keep
in your wardrobe they're totally
timeless every single autumn and winter
we see roll necks coming back into
fashion and for good reason
they're super versatile in fact if
you've got a favorite summer dress or a
summer skirt using a roll neck is a
really lovely way of making that outfit
autumn and winter appropriate I also
feel that the row neck is totally
ageless I've been wearing them for many
many years
my mum loves them they are absolutely
timeless so definitely a piece that is
worth investing in in your wardrobe but
also you can pick up so many beautiful
row necks on the high street - so for
this video I'm going to be showing you a
bit of a lookbook of a few of my
favorite ways to style a row neck at the
moment but first I'm just going to
quickly go through a few of my favorite
roll necks in my wardrobe so a row neck
can be any material within reason this
is one that I have had the most wear out
of in my wardrobe is a cashmere roll
neck not as tight-fitting to the body as
many traditional roll necks but it does
have a balloon sleeve which is a bit of
a nod to the trend that we saw coming
through this autumn winter as I said
cashmere material super super soft and
one of my go-to roll neck pieces in my
wardrobe this is another roll neck with
a nod to a trend from Ted Baker this has
got a beautiful frill detail around the
collar just gives it a lovely feminine
touch to it in this beautiful metallic
thread that same detail is found down at
the bottom of the sleeves I love pairing
this with really floaty skirts or if I
want to add a more feminine touch to
quite a polished work outfit then this
is my go to the most recent roll neck
that I've added to my wardrobe is this
one I picked this up in the Tori pouch
sale I will try to find it and leave it
linked down below hopefully it's not
sold out but this is the one that I'm
going to be styling up in a few
different ways for the lookbook so stay
tuned
for that this one was an investment
piece I did spend more on this than I
would on traditional high street real
neck but because of the versatility of
this kind of garment in my wardrobe I
definitely felt it was worth spending a
little bit more to get that quality
because I'm confident that I'm gonna get
the price but we're really low down
because I don't wear too much black I
didn't want to spend a lot of money on a
black role neck but I do feel that a
black Roenick it's a bit of a staple in
your wardrobe especially during the
winter months so I got this one from
Zara this one has a lovely pearl detail
on the sleeves which is just a detail
that I absolutely love any kind of
feminine touches to a classic item like
this I am a huge huge fan of so these
are the row necks that I have in my
personal wardrobe and I would say that
all of them from the high street to the
high-end ones they are amongst the most
worn pieces in my wardrobe because they
just work with so many outfits so I hope
the rest of this video gives you a
little bit of inspiration on how to wear
your own Rolex enjoy okay so we're
starting off with what is actually my
favourite outfit at the moment I've
teamed my white Tory Burch roll neck
with this suede skirt from Reese the
skirt was also a bit of an investment
piece but I wear suede skirt so much I
thought it'd be really worth it
I've also paired it with Tory Burch over
knee boots and then this is my gray
velvet Kate Spade bag to make this
outfit a little bit more interesting and
warm I've also added my feather Club
Monaco gelee which just makes it really
really cozy and a really nice
interesting texture as well
for another layer of warmth I've just
popped my Rhys camel coat over the top
and this just makes for the perfect
winter outfit of the day
look number two this is actually a new
skirt from Kate Spade but if you've got
any favorite skirts from summer then
instead of wearing camisole wearing a
roll neck with your skirt is such a
lovely way to make it autumn winter
appropriate this could be a really nice
going out outfit I've got my beautiful
velvet shoes with it and a crossbody bag
and just generally again another my
favorite outfits of the moment a classic
way to wear a roll neck is of course
with jeans I love high waisted jeans
these ones up in Topshop and I find them
do really really flattering what could
be a very simple outfit I've made a
little bit more fun with this amazing
pink coat also Topshop I absolutely love
it
I get so many compliments when I wear it
and then a pastel colored bag to this
shot here just a plain rolnick and jeans
is as simple and chic as it comes
and then finally this is a way to style
a roll neck bulwark a very classic look
I feel like this is a very typical
London look with this Burberry Duke
trench coat is not Burberry although it
really does look like it it's actually
85 pounds from River Island I'll leave
it linked down below I've made the look
really smart as well with this aspinall
handbag and some very classic
accessories
now that the coats open you can see that
I've just tucked the roll neck into
these black trousers a really perfect
office look very smart but lovely and
feminine too there's this really lovely
floral detail down the sides of the
trousers which just gives a nod to a
very nice feminine style or a classic
office look so that's my final look I
really hope you enjoyed the video and
I'll see you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
