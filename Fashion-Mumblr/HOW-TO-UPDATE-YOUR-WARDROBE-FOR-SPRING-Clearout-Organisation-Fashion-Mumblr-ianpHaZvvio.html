video in the 2018 fashion Rambler spring
edit so as you probably know if you've
watched any of my recent videos spring
is my favorite season by a long long way
I just adore everything about it I love
the fashions this year in particular
there are so many trends that are so up
my street so every single year here on
my youtube channel I say every single
year for the past three years I have
marked the arrival of spring with a
fashion mumbler spring added so I do a
series of videos usually five videos
dedicated to spring and this is the
first of the 2018 spring edit so coming
your way very soon we have a whole host
of amazing spring content including
hauls we've got a makeup routine I've
got spring basics loads of really fun
videos so please make sure you are
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and so that you don't miss out
on any of the upcoming spring edit
videos today we're going to be talking
about getting your wardrobe ready for
spring and I'm going to be showing by
example and going to be giving my very
own wardrobe ready for spring I did this
video last year as well it was a spring
wardrobe update and but since then I now
have a walking wardrobe room you guys
might have seen at the video where we
built this and my recent closet tour
video so basically I'm going to be
having a bit of a clear-out
I probably won't be getting rid of too
much stuff because I tend to clear
things out little by little and all the
time so if there's something that I
noticed I haven't worn in a while then I
will tend to take you to the charity
shop straight away so there might not be
too much for clear out but what I do do
is keep my seasonal items in the
wardrobe or in the loft so I have got a
couple of suitcases behind the door that
is the clothes that I bought and packed
away from last spring summers I'm going
to be looking through all of those but
first of all I'm going to be clearing
away putting up in the loft and all of
the really deep winter things which I
don't think I'll be wearing until
hopefully October November time so
that's gonna be things like hats and
gloves thermals any really wintery coats
really wintery jumpers things like that
so yeah that's the first thing to do
pick out any deep winter things and pack
them away into storage so let's do it
all right so I'm going to get started
with my shoes here is where I keep most
of my shoes I'm going to take out any
that are really wintry any really
wintery boots things like that things
that hopefully I won't have to wear in
the next couple of months and they are
going to go into the loft for storage
there are also some spring shoes that
are already here so it's not going to be
a case of taking them all out I'm really
going to be quite selective as to what
stays and what goes up into storage
get busy
so I've taken out a lot of the shoes
which are really wintry for example
boots like this which have got a fluffy
lining and a big wintry sole and then
I've also taken out loads of my black
ankle boots
I feel like black ankle boots are a real
staple in an autumn wardrobe but I don't
wear a lot of black and I definitely
don't wear much black in spring so these
can safely go up into the loft what I
have done actually is separate this into
two piles so I've got the pile here of
shoes which I'm keeping and the wasting
coal of next season and I've actually
got a pile of shoes which I'm going to
sell I'm trying to think the best way
for me to sell them I don't really like
eBay because I find it just too much of
a faff but I have got a date in the
diary for clothing sale in London and if
any of you guys watching would like to
come to that I will leave the
information down below it's gonna be in
the next couple of weeks
so if you want to shop my wardrobe I'll
leave the information for that down
below for example I've got shoes like
this my Valentino dupes um I don't think
I'll wear those next year they were very
affordable actually actually they've
worn really well I've worn them a couple
of times but they certainly don't show
any signs of wear I don't think I love
those so much next year my Chloe Susanna
oops I very rarely wore these actually I
bought them because they were amazing
dupes but I've got my beige colored ones
which are real so I don't refund myself
reaching for the dupes very often at all
so I'm gonna sell those and then I've
also got some boots from Kurt Geiger
Topshop basically I just have far too
many black ankle boots so a lot of these
are going to go in the bag for my sale
all of the things I'm selling are going
in this big bag I got this from ASOS
I've got a few of them they are really
really handy I'll leave these bags links
down below if you're doing any curing
out then I highly recommend picking up a
few of these so it's out with the old
and in with the new these are some shoes
that I have bought recently I've
previously been storing them in the
spare room because I have been using
them for filming for hauls etc so I'll
very quickly show you a few favorites
these ones from Topshop are probably my
favorite shoes that I'm most excited to
wear they've got a gorgeous little round
heel and then basically pink mules very
excited to wear those
then we've got these ones from misguided
I thought they were amazing dupes for
Jean Vita Rossi shoes all of these I
will leave link down below in case you
want to shop any of them but they are
really really beautiful they've got the
perspex transparent sides they look
identical to my John Beattie russy's but
more comfortable because they have got
an ankle strap I mentioned in my what's
new in my wardrobe video these new shoes
from Reese and I did say that I also had
the last year's version which these ones
actually they've got a bit of perspex on
kind of ahead of the trend there but I
wore these loads last year and this is
basically the new season update then
we've got some little flats from Topshop
I think these will be really good ones
to take on our upcoming holidays some
more sandals from Topshop I think
Topshop do really good quality shoes for
very good prices I've picked up a few
pairs of sandals from there lately
and then last pair that I'm adding are
these ones also from Topshop I think
these would be really nice to wear with
jeans and things like that so those are
my new shoes going in if you've watched
any of my halls lately and you're
thinking what about those what about
those obviously when I do hauls that is
me unboxing things for the first time so
some things do get returned but these
are the majority of the shoes which I
have kept from up my recent haul videos
so next I'm going to move on it to the
following door and that's where I keep
my over knee boots now I will wear over
knee boots in the
weeks and months I think but some of
them are very wintry like black ones I
think those can definitely go up in the
loft so as you can see I have rather a
lot of over knee boots
I literally have so many over knee boots
I absolutely love them I think I'm gonna
use this as an opportunity to clear some
out though what I very often do for
research sake is buy dupes of shoes I
already own for example I have got the
Stuart Weitzman where are they what are
the actual sterilized ones you go I have
got these Stuart Weitzman brown over
knee boots and then I also bought these
ones which are from I have not even worn
these that's ridiculous these ones I
think are from ego and then I've got
another affordable pair I can't read
where these are all from I will leave a
link down below so I have three if not
four pairs of brown over knee boots
which I just do not need obviously I'm
gonna keep these Stuart Weitzman ones so
these are going to go back into the
wardrobe and because they're brown I
think I could definitely wear them in
spring as well I leather boots from L K
Bennett's I've been wearing these so
much lately I think these are perfect
spring of boots so they're definitely
going to go back in as well this pair of
over knee boots which is a pair of dukes
I don't think I'll wear these because
I'll always reach for the stool
Wiseman's instead so I'm gonna put those
in the pile to sell
next my tory burch ones really really
like these I didn't actually wear them
that much over the winter so I bought
them in the January sales midway through
January these are a nice light grace I
think that work for spring as well as
gonna pop those back inside another pair
of dupes these are actually not the best
quality and if you can see there on the
zip it's just not particularly well
finished so I'm gonna put these in the
pile
sell these ones from Karen Millen are
quite possibly my favorite over new
boots they are gray they are so
comfortable I finally go with so many
things and I'm not ready to put them in
the loft yet so they're going to go back
in the order as well these are the exact
same boots but in brown they are the
2016 version I think the brown is more
or Tumnus if these are going to get
ready to go into storage and I'm also
gonna put my black Stuart Weitzman over
knee boots into storage as well keep my
Zara ones because I love those and sell
my black Stuart Weitzman dupes
ok so the next section I'm going to
tackle is this section here which is
where I keep my long coats I'm gonna
keep a few in here because it is only
the very beginning of spring so the
temperatures aren't quite the warmest so
I'm going to keep a couple just in case
you do have any really chilly days but
I'm going to put any that are really
dark colors ones that are really or
tunnel or really wintry into storage so
let's do it
once again I've separated my coats into
three different piles I've got the pile
over here which is one that I'm going to
be putting in a lot of storage a few
coats down here which I'm going to sell
I'm gonna get rid of my Topshop teddy
bear coat I absolutely love this where
it's so much in the winter but I feel
like this is a trend that may not come
back so that's gonna go into the bag for
selling equally I've got my pink fluffy
coat from Topshop oh I don't know what
to sell this or not but I do have
something quite similar from rebel I
think I'll probably try this one and the
revolt went on and then decide which one
I prefer to keep that and then I have
got a lot of trench coats in my wardrobe
and one that I absolutely adore is my
Kate Spade one in this pile somewhere no
Kate Spade Ted Baker I've also got one
that I love from River Island so I'm
actually going to get rid of this one
from Karen Millen I do love it but I
actually don't wear much silver and this
is got silver studs on it so that just
kind of is my one reason for making this
the one that I do get rid of this I
probably will list on eBay because I
think it's actually fairly new season
and I think I could probably get a
little bit more for it on eBay than at
my clothing sales so yes that's gonna
that's gonna go online as for the coats
I'm keeping yeah there are a few spring
coats here already I did bring down a
suitcase full of spring coats about four
weeks ago when this water room was just
finished because I was finding that I
wanted to start wearing a lot more
lighter colors so some of these for
example actually this Burberry I got
from Vista Village a couple of years ago
he used to be my dog walking coat I'm
still really good if you that sounds
ridiculous doesn't it I wear a coat dog
walking but it's like one of these
waterproof materials and it does after a
few years it is looking a bit scruffy
now so yeah very fancy dog walking coat
this is the Ted Baker trench coat I was
telling you about really love this one
it's got black piping amazing lining as
you so often get with Ted Baker so this
is gonna be my token that trench coat in
my spring wardrobe this coat from River
Island I loved so much throughout the
winter and
because of its light color I think that
we're really good for those chilly
spring days that we have so I'm not
ready to put this one into storage yet
either
this coat is actually a couple of years
old it is from Reese I recently recently
picked up this Reese coat from the dry
cleaner after having it in storage for a
while
Reese bring back this style of coat it's
basically it's a trench style coat in
its shape but then it's got this Cape
detail at the back it does have a waist
belt here but instead of like a creamy
trench coat color it's more like a lilac
and I absolutely love it it's got this a
couple of years ago but they do have
something very very similar this year
they tend to bring back their most
popular pieces year after year with a
few little design changes so I'll leave
this year's version links down below but
I haven't worn this yet this spring
that's a very excited to do so this is
another one that I absolutely love this
winter but I think it's just so gorgeous
and I'm not quite ready to put it away
for the season so this is gonna go back
in the wardrobe equally with this one
from Karen Millen again a couple of
years old but this is my go-to on really
really cold days if I'm doing any long
days out of the house if it does happen
to snow again the weather here has been
crazy then this is someone that I want
beach for this is a new one from Reese
you guys have seen me wearing this a lot
but I Instagram lately another one from
Reese from last year that again they
have a similar version of this year this
has actually got a mark on it so I'm
gonna pop that in a pile to go to the
dry cleaners the one that I've been
living in and non-stop the game from
Reese going straight back in the
wardrobe my river island trench coat
love it going back in and then this one
from Ted Baker again you might have seen
this one on my Instagram this is very
much for like special occasions any
weddings that kind of thing so yeah
absolutely love this one going it's
straight back in next I've just pulled
all my handbags down from this top
section I've got a few black bags which
I definitely won't be using in the
springtime such as this big one from
Kate Spade and then I've also got my big
mulberry Cecily bag which has got a few
lighter code bags inside so I think what
I'm gonna do is keep these lighter
colored handbags we've got my very very
practical that's Hori birch tote and
then inside it is my
the wrong tote bag.this on here you
might remember it if you've been
watching my channel for a while these
are both really handy bags for the
spring time so they're going to go back
up here also my Kate Spade baby it's
cold outside tote this is a very wintery
bag but because it's just a big bucket
bag I find myself using it so much like
if I just need to grab a load of things
together to stay overnight at mom's
house and this is the bag I've always
reach for so I'm gonna put this back up
there as well this is my first ever
designer handbag my mulberry Bayswater
looking a little bit sorry for itself I
might try to find something to stuff
this with to store it a bit better and
then I've got an everyday bag my Michael
Kors satchel bag this is going to go at
the top there as well so I can
definitely wear this in the springtime
as well
have you seen from those high collapses
I have just cleared out one more section
of the cupboard it's getting really
weird and echo in here and then I've
also done my drawers down here it's got
to get Messier before it gets tidy it's
at the moment I am surrounded by piles
of clothes I've got my clothes to sell
in this box this bag rather so what I
think I'm going to do is actually label
this as clothes to sell in autumn
because I don't think anyone's going to
be wanting to buy tracksuit bottoms
jumpers and coats at this time of year
so what I'm going to do is label this up
and get it out in maybe October time and
sell it then because ya know it's gonna
want to buy winter stuff now so that's
gonna go into storage and then I've got
these piles down the back here these are
things that I'm gonna be keeping so I
need to put these in suitcases ready to
store for the spring and summer
get those out again in September October
time so what I'm going to do now is get
my two suitcases which have got my last
year's spring/summer things in a lot of
pieces are probably gonna need washing
or steaming and I'm going to decide
which I'm going to keeping which I am
going to get rid of I did actually do
this system last season where I put
stuff that I knew I wanted to sell in a
separate bag so I'm not going to go
through all of those bits because they
can pretty much go straight to a charity
shop or straight to a clothing sale but
let's have a rummage through the bits
that I decided that I would want to keep
for this spring and summer
okay I've now got the majority of my
spring clothing out of the suitcases
once again I am surrounded by piles of
clothing but in my head this is all
organized I did mention in a recent
what's new in my wardrobe video that I
do have some spring investment pieces
from previous years that I was going to
kind of re-evaluate and see if they were
still in my opinion timeless classics
worth investing in so I thought I would
show you very quickly a few spring
investment pieces or just general
wardrobe investment pieces from previous
years and I'm pleased to say that most
of them in fact all of them I'm still
keeping it's actually just high-street
pieces which have gone in my pile of
things to sell I've got this t-shirt
from Ted Baker I remember loving this
when I bought it last year it's got lace
sleeves and then other than that it's
quite thick feels like silk but it's
actually I think polyester t-shirt with
a v-neck goes with so many things and I
love it then I've got a few of these
silk tops from Reese this one I've had
for about three years in a gray color
and then this one I've got in pink I
also have it somewhere in white as well
and then a couple of these silky
camisole tops these ones I've sleeveless
ones be this white one is a really thin
silk and then the pink one is a little
bit thicker it's actually missing a
button on the back so I'm going to put
that in my pile of things to do these
ones I have just steamed obviously silk
gets creased very very easily especially
when it's been in storage for a few
months of the year and I have been using
this snazzy gadget I'm gonna bring you a
bit closer because it's still plugged
into the wall this is my new Philips
steam and go+ it's called I was actually
sent this very kindly from Philips a
couple of weeks ago and so I'm just
putting it to good use and I have to say
very impressed I do prefer steaming my
clothes to ironing them because I never
come aboard to get out an ironing board
and actually iron things whereas this I
can just store in my bedroom and if I'm
gonna wear something just very quickly
flick it
and then steam it takes a couple of
seconds takes like just under a minute
for this to warm up and it's obviously
really really tiny so great for very
quick steaming sessions I do have quite
a pile of things here behind me that's
still needs steaming the downside with
the Philips steamer is that it's only
got quite a small water barrel this is
where the water is obviously that's what
keeps it tiny but it means that after
maybe five items I have to go to the
bathroom and fill it up again so I'm
gonna use my old steam at the big one
just to go through these last few pieces
but then to be honest I think I'm gonna
put my big steamer in the loft because
it's very rare that I have to do more
than two or three pieces at one time
usually I just steam the outfit that I'm
going to wear that day or if I'm doing a
video then I'll steam a few pieces
before showing you guys on the rail but
yeah it seems pointless to have my
ginormous steamer taking up loads of
room in my bedroom when I can just have
this in the cupboard so I'm gonna do the
last few pieces with my big steamer and
then that's going to go up and aloft
something else is good about this
Philips one is that if you're not
pressing this button here it's not
actually puttering out steam whereas
this item behind me is constantly
puttering out steam whether I'm actually
steam it's not so feels it more wasteful
whereas
it's just yeah very impressed I will
leave a link this down below because I
think this might be when you favorite to
wardrobe gadget this is my Karen Millen
dress that I wore at Wimbledon last year
and I wore it loads of different events
I'm very excited to be wearing this one
again so yeah this is another investment
piece I will definitely still be writing
this year see what I mean there's just
continually covers and now my room is
like a steam room I'm with the steaming
so I'm going to put a lot of these
pieces back into my wardrobe now so
again I'm going to show you a few more
of my like previous year investment
pieces these are a beautiful pair of
plain white Rhys shorts I got these last
spring these featured in my spring I
think I call the videos spring wardrobe
essentials but is basically a spring
lookbook and love that video if you
haven't seen it yet I'll leave it linked
on the screen and down below so
definitely go check that out
but these essentially just a plain pair
of white shorts so I'll definitely be
wearing those again this spring and
summer
and then I've got a couple of white
shirts again these are all pieces from
Rhys I find with Rhys I tend to go for
the really classic pieces so I do wear
them year after year this is a very long
white blouse and it's got a waist belt
so you can wear this over legging like
jeans or you can even wear it over
shorts things like that and I just find
it super super flattering and a white
shirt is basically a wardrobe essential
I do have to start you fancy a white
shirt as well and this one's got ruffle
detail on the collar can you see that
again from Rhys all of these pieces
I just wouldn't wear if I didn't have a
steamer because I would almost be too
scared to iron them I hate ironing silk
things and then I put a few more silk
tops playing white tee shirts
with a silk front and then again more of
a vest style so lots more investment
pieces I picked up over the years from
Rhys and then also from Club Monaco as
well these are some skirts that you
might recognize this one with the
scallops bottom very excited to wear
that again and then this one here which
was not quite so easy to steam this has
got these scalloped asymmetric hem but
they fit my style so perfectly so I'm
gonna put these all in wardrobe now do
you have a pile of codes here which I'm
going to sell and then a couple of
dresses which are going to go in my
wardrobe too so it's time to fill my
wardrobe up with spring pieces a little
bit dark outside so sorry if I have a
weird lighting going on over my head but
now again we have reached the fun part
which is bringing the new things that
I've bought recently into my wardrobe so
these bits you might recognize from
recent hauls I've got Rhys and very
common theme here I've got a lot of
lovely spring classic pieces from Rhys
I've got some river island pieces French
Connection so now I'm going to put these
into my wardrobe which has a little bit
more space in it but to be honest this
is probably the time of year this and
when I go from summer to autumn is when
my wardrobe is really at its fullest
because I'm not quite ready to put all
of my knitwear away for storage because
you do have the odd chilly day but then
I also have a lot of my spring/summer
stuff in my wardrobe so if I show you
inside here now you can see it's a lot
more full than it was to begin with
because I've got some really nice
summery pieces like these kind of
blouses but I am not quite ready to put
things like this which is my cashmere
polo neck away so I've got both best of
both in my wardrobe at the moment but
it's fine now that we have our lovingly
walking wardrobes I do have the luxury
of the space to be able to do that so
yeah time to fill it up with my new
pieces and then we are pretty much
finished two new tops for recess you'll
have seen these in recent home videos
got my lace one and then this which is
definitely gonna be your kind of thing
that I wear year after year with little
pearls on the sleeves other than that
plain t-shirt so these are going to go
in my main section and this lovely lace
t-shirts from French Connection again
it's something I'll probably wear year
after year but I've already started
wearing it this spring and looking
forward to getting this is a new one
from River Island it's very very summery
it's kind of like a beach style top for
every Anglais with big kind of Spanish
siesta flamenco styled sleeves but I
don't want to forget about it for my
next holiday so I'm gonna put this on in
here anyway for more classic pieces I
have got this t-shirt which annoyingly I
think I might have burnt with the iron
that is really annoying I'm going to
steam that see if they come out that is
from Topshop and then I've also got this
lovely blouse again from French
Connection then I've got a couple of
longer items this is my pleated skirt
from Rhys and then these my new lace
trousers from French Connection these
live in a different section of the
wardrobe so I'm going to spin you around
if you saw my wardrobe tour video you'll
know that this is my kind of
double-height section I've just swapped
it around a little bit all my skirts
used to be at the bottom but now I've
got my longer skirts at the top so
there's a little bit more room for them
and then I've got shorter skirts down
here at the bottom and my trousers are
on these kind of half height hangers and
then the final pieces to go in are some
new dresses that I have from Club Monaco
and from Rees again I keep my dresses in
this part of the wardrobes it is a
little bit it's got a little bit more
space height wise so yes these are
officially moving in so that is pretty
much my spring wardrobe update complete
I will of course gradually over time
replace a few things as I mentioned I do
still have some thick jumpers cashmere
jumpers and things like that that I'm
not quite ready to put away in storage
but over time as a term
do start to remain consistently high I
will of course put those away and I do
have a suitcase full of really kind of
high summer pieces like strappy desktops
dresses things like that bikinis that I
don't need right now it is still very
early spring
but over time I will bring those into my
water over but this and my spring summer
switching to autumn winter on my to big
wardrobe shifts off year so I'm really
glad that I've got that done I also
think it's a really good thing to do to
take stock of what you've got it helps
you to really know what's in your
wardrobe which of course helps you to
put together outfits and also helps you
realize if you do have any gaps in your
wardrobe so if there's anything any
classic pieces that you're missing it'll
help you understand what you might need
so a really good thing to do it
beginning off a season and as I
mentioned I have got loads more videos
