joining me for today's video today I'm
going to be sharing a few tips on how to
make the most of your summer clothes as
we move into autumn so how to wear those
pieces that you've been loving all
summer and you're not quite ready to put
away for the autumn months there's going
to be a few tips on new pieces to invest
in but also how to rework at your
existing favorites I'm going to be doing
lots of videos along these sort of lines
on how to really transition into autumn
as well as all terminal trends so if you

to be so much coming your way very very
soon and if you do love fashion videos
and please give this video a thumbs up
and let me know if you've got any
autumnal video ideas as well down in the
comments section I'd love to know what
kind of things you'd like to see from me
as well so one of the things that I
absolutely loved wearing this summer and
that I'm not ready to say goodbye to
just yet are my floral dresses so my
first tip is how you can wear these
floral dresses now the temperatures are
starting to get a bit cooler and we're
really wanting to inject a few of those
autumn trends into our wardrobes so I've
chosen this dress to style up and yes
this is quite an autumnal colored dress
these tones is very terracotta a very
earthy tones are very suitable for
summer but if you've got any summer
dresses that are even white anything
with Browns Gold's in them then they
would work equally as well so the ways
that I would switch this up for my
autumn wardrobe are by adding some key
or tunnel accessories such as firstly a
suede biker jacket this is one from
River Island that I picked up really
recently it's a little bit of an
investment piece it's just over the 100
pound mark but having said that for real
suede jackets other stores on the high
street of charging triple that so I
actually think this is really good
investment for this transitional time of
year as well it just works with so many
different outfits and looks absolutely
beautiful paired with this kind of
colored dress and a maxi dress as well
you'd want something that's a little bit
more cropped so for that reason a biker
style jacket were
so so perfectly another way of making
this dress more autumnal
is with a really again earthy colored
autumnal accessory these are new pair of
boots that I've got from Ted Baker
they're a car key color and I never
really thought about how I'd be able to
fit car key boots into my wardrobe but
I'm finding myself reaching for these
for so many outfits at this time of year
they're a really good heel height as
well so if you still want to get that
height boost to redress up your summer
dresses then the height of these boots
works really really well for that
towards the end of summer I found myself
bringing lots more into my wardrobe if
you saw my what I wore in Tuscany video
which I'll leave linked on the screen
here you may remember I wore this
beautiful terracotta almost orangie
brown pair of clocks there with a
strappy top I have also now invested in
another pair of culottes these ones are
a little bit thicker and also a really
lovely autumnal color the way that I'm
going to be styling these up over the
next few weeks and months is with this
beautiful blouse now this blouse I did a
boy thing with this and I actually
brought this in two colors I've never
really done that before I find as girls
we tend to buy different styles whereas
guys if they like a shirt they'll buy in
a few different colors well I did with
this one I also picked it up in this
beautiful rust color which you'll see me
starting in a few moments but this I
think is a really beautiful outfit for
this time of year
and then especially with some more
autumnal boots I have these beautiful
soft brown leather boots don't pick it
up from Topshop which are we seeing me
styling on the screen now and they're a
really lovely way of making what could
be an end-of-summer piece very much
appropriate for Werdum possibly one of
my favorite items of clothing from the
summer season our play suits and mini
dresses I bump them into the same
category lengthwise this is again one
that I've picked up fairly recently for
an upcoming holiday but you can pretty
much style up many of your summer places
for autumn just for the simple addition
of some ankle boots if you follow me on
instagram or you've seen any of my other
content recently you won't be surprised
to hear that I'm recommending my Chloe
Susannah boots to really toughen up and
add an autumn arrived to your site play
suits I'm so glad that I went for this
color in the end I just find that
they're very leg-lengthening and they
work really well with bare legs
whereas I personally
think that I'd find the black ones a
little bit too harsh on the end of their
legs it could be a little bit like
shortening short girl problems but they
work beautifully with this play suit
this one is River island and I'll
definitely be wearing this in sea autumn
months especially with perhaps a suede
coat over the top if it does start to
get a little bit chillier and this place
sue in particular is just perfect for
going into all chunks it's got really
beautiful velvety detail and again these
really earthy autumnal colors which are
just so stunning and yet I've still got
that blush pink which I can't live
without a real investment piece for me
recently was my Zimmermann dress I'll
insert a photo on the screen here of me
wearing it in Sorrento recently and when
you spend that amount of money on
something you want to make sure you can
get as much wear out of it as possible
so again for this in sum I actually only
got it a few weeks ago so I have been
wearing it more or tongue a leap and
summer I could have worn this with
sandals with my gladiator sandals that
kind of thing but now that we're moving
into autumn determined to still keep it
in my wardrobe again I'll be styling
this with the Chloe boots and you could
wear it with something like a warmer
toned this is a faux suede jacket again
from River Island you guys have been
loving this one this has been a real hit
this summer such a beautiful soft
material really affordable and a great
way of making this a little bit more
warm and cozy for those cooler days and
evenings and another way that I'm making
at this summery play suit more autumnal
is with an autumnal colored accessory
this is the Chloe now bag you may have
seen my unboxing video for this which
again I'll leave linked on the screen
and in that video I also share a few
tips on how to invest in a luxury
handbags there check that out and but
yeah because of the color of this
beautiful or tunnel Oxford it just
instantly makes an outfit look more
appropriate for autumn and really gives
them nod to those autumn trends white
jeans are something that I love wearing
in the summer months especially on those
slightly cooler days when you don't
necessarily want to have your neck
styles I just adore them and once again
that this is a style that I'm not ready
to say goodbye to just yet just because
we are technically going into autumn so
how I've styled this up for autumn is by
adding a really lovely autumnal colored
blouse this could be a drinking game how
every time I say the program or several
don't know but either way this is a
blouse and I'm going to be styling this
with it's the same as the blush one from
over Island I showed you earlier I
absolutely adore this blouse the
material is perfect the color is perfect
the only thing that does slightly annoy
me is that the closure in the middle is
a hook and I I think I'm going to try
putting some buttons on there just to
give it a little bit more closure
especially is going to autumn we don't
want to be revealing it too much but as
a combination this looks absolutely
gorgeous and really just adds an autumn
page to the white jeans again I styled
the white jeans with my Topshop brown
boots these are turning into one of
those pieces that I know I'm going to
wear so much over the coming months
they're very slim fitting and because of
these stiletto heel as opposed to a
chunky heel they just seem to be very
elongating and very elegant as opposed
to having something really chunky and
clunky at the end of your legs
so find these very very flattering and a
great style to wear with white jeans
another piece that I loved wearing it
throughout summer and spring pretty much
at all times of the year you have
probably seen me wearing my Reese on
quite a lot which is just absolute
stunning it's called a nice pleated
skirt the way that it floats out is just
gorgeous and this one is even more
affordable this is from Topshop it's
slightly metallic and has an asymmetric
cuts hem the way that I'm going to be
styling this up in autumn is with a
really cozy chunky net this one is from
Free People I only ordered this actually
this morning from a sauce but I know
it's going to be a piece that I will
wear a lot because it's just so snuggly
warm this material is super super soft
and cozy I just tuck in the front
section in the middle to the skirt to
help it like billow over a little bit
because if it's too baggy it can be
slightly unflattering but if you do
still tuck it in to create a bit more of
a feminine silhouette then it is a
really really lovely style I paired it
with my
pointed toe flats these are in a
beautiful almost grey greeny suede I
find these are getting incredibly
versatile my lookbook that I did in
collaboration with Elizabeth Arden
you'll have seen me styling these are
the floral maxi dress but they work
equally as beautifully with a mini skirt
as well I find the pointed toe really
helps to elongate the legs which does
keep the look nice and flattering this
sounds like a really obvious one but of
course a way to transition your summer
wardrobe and your summer pieces into
autumn is by adding extra layers and my
favorite layers of course our coats and
capes I find capes this year I think it
can be really big if you watched my
autumn winter 2017 trend video you've
heard me talking briefly about those
this one is a lovely one from Rhode
Island and you may have seen a whole
video that I did I didn't actually
realize it had little sleeve sections so
if you're one of the eagle-eyed viewers
that noticed them thank you because I
wouldn't had a clue if you hadn't
mentioned it but yeah this is a really
lovely cozy piece and I've actually
started with this dress which is a
course of jumper dress something I've
invested in already for autumn but
that's just because I'm an eager beaver
but you could also star capes over your
favorite summer dresses as well such as
a white floaty day dress even a play
suit because capes can be quite covering
you can really be quite versatile with
what you want underneath it this is a
coat that I just invested in from River
Island it was 85 pounds which i think is
pretty good value for a coat that I'm
going to wear as much as I can tell I'm
going to wear this one guys I would
recommend investing in this pretty soon
so I think it's already selling out and
I bought something quite similar sis
from remind last year and of course I
started wearing it a few months down the
line obviously it's a little bit too
early for this kind of coats now and so
many of you are very disappointed it
already sold out so invest now would be
my tip for this one and beautiful color
beautiful thick material it's going to
be very warm and I'm excited for the
temperatures to get cooler so that I can
wear this even more and then I keep
those perhaps a little bit more suitable
for this time of year when we want a
little bit of extra warmth but we're not
ready to go full-on autumnal coat or
darker colors is this beautiful one from
coast it's just got the most beautiful
hang to it it looks so luxurious and it
really is so warm and snuggly so once
again summer dresses you just want to
add a bit of warmth this is the perfect
thing to do so and this color is really
fabulous for this time of year not too
dark and heavy but still really lovely
and soft and cozy of course if you're
not ready to invest in any autumnal
clothing just yet that's absolutely fine
you can always give a nod to autumnal
trends
other ways with your accessories a few
of my favorites these little tassel
earrings from Topshop they've got that
burgundy colored tassel which is of
course a nod to the autumnal trend of
Oxford and burgundy that we keep seeing
year after year so if you've got any
white or gray or neutral colors this is
an instant way to add that with tonal
color to your outfit I already mentioned
also the Chloe gnarl bag but another one
and this one you'll be pleased to know
is a lot more affordable I think it's
either 22 or 29 pounds
links to everything will be down below
if you want to shop anything but this
one was from Topshop again in my trends
video I bet you guys know how big maxi
bags and especially faux fur ones are
going to be everywhere this autumn and
this top top one is just absolutely
perfect I've already used it so much
it's so big and versatile and instantly
makes an outfit look more tunnel answer
to another photo on the screen here of
me wearing it with one of my favorite
floral and summer day dresses but
instantly because of the texture it's
just instant autumn for your outfit so

summer clothes into the autumn months

wardrobe into the upcoming season so I
