clear-out video oh it's Sunday morning
I've just gone out a shower washed my
hair and I'm feeling very productive and
in the mood to declutter you know
sometimes you just get that bug and you
need to get rid of things or that's what
I have this morning so I thought I would
clear out my beauty products I haven't
done it in quite a while
it's coming up to that time of year
where we're going to be spring cleaning
and I actually have a new kind of like a
Hollywood mirror coming soon and I
wanted to put that in and just have a
really lovely Beauty area so it
desperately needs decluttering I've also
been really struggling to shut the
drawers on my beauty cupboard lately my
beauty kind of desk item so it's
definitely time to do a clear-out but I
thought I would do it on camera because
I find watching clear out videos really
therapeutic and I thought it'd be quite
a nice way of showing when I'm using and
what I don't use anymore and also maybe
let you know why I'm getting rid of
certain things so let me flip you around
and show you the current Beauty setup
okay so excuse the mess I obviously have
not tidied up prior to my clear out but
this chest of drawers here is where I
currently store all my beauty products I
always watch a youtube video when I'm
doing my makeup I often have things that
have just arrived in my PA box on the
top here so that I know to try them out
for example I've got the rosy for
autograph Foundation which actually I
popped on today and really really liked
it then I've got the new Laura Mercier
foundation I've got some willy der
beauty balm tinted day creams haven't
tried those yet but I will give those a
go tomorrow and then I've also got the
new Bobbi Brown's skin long wire
weightless foundation this I have to say
really impressive so far it does make my
skin look like skin I'm gonna give this
a few more tries to out the rest of the
week to see if it's going to be added to
my permanent collection things have to
be really special for me to want to keep
hold of them because I do have so many
products I get sent a lot with what I do
with Beauty blogging and beauty here on
YouTube rands often send PR samples very
very generous which you guys all know if
you've watched my unboxing videos so I
try to be quite brutal with what I
actually keep this little box here
definitely needs clearing out it's got
my makeup brushes got tweezers a
selection of lip balms and things like
and then this is probably my tower of
most used products so at the top here
again brushes which I will have a clear
out of my brushes and anything I use all
of them these are the New Deal serums
which again I'm testing out they each
have a different use and so far I'm
really really liking those and then as
we go down this top drawer is mostly lip
balms or products that are quite balmy
and get a little bit of tint then the
next one down is liquid lipsticks I can
imagine that I'll be getting rid of
quite a lot of fees I'm gonna be quite
brutal as to if they are drying on the
lips or if I still really love the color
this is kind of the next level of
intensity actually I do have a balm
snuck in there and my by Terry so things
are a little bit messy and disorganized
at the moment but this should be more
lipsticks so you are gonna have a pair
of those this should be my mascara draw
nobody needs this many mascara so I'm
going to be quite brutal as to what I
get rid of and either are a little bit
old I am going to be very conscious of
makeup expiry dates I'm going to leave a
blog post I've done down below which
gives you information on how long things
should last fall so if you're doing
clear out you can use that as a bit of a
guide this is a brow draw again I've got
far too many products in here ranging
from brow gels brow pencils my Anastasia
ones keep breaking a very annoying but
there's far too much in here I think
there's quite a lot of lip liners in
there as well and eyeliners and will
sort that out the order doesn't really
make sense because we're back to lips
now this is another lipstick drawer it's
so full I can barely open it there's
quite a few products in here that I've
actually forgotten about so that proves
how much of a clear-out is needed this
is a new one that I haven't even tried
yet lots of lovely shots chill breeze'
some more like wintry shades and then
another lipstick drawer this is my kind
of like posh lipstick drawer I've got my
Tom Ford collection Estee Lauder's and
then I mean these are so old I'm
definitely going to be having a clear
out of old lipsticks then we go down to
this was meant to be my eye shadow draw
but then it's also got some blush in
there some concealers haven't really
tried this one out yet
oh yeah just getting a little bit messy
and then this is even more concealers I
need to definitely reduce my eyeshadow
and concealer drawers quite a lot so
that's what's on top of this cabinet as
I said I'm getting a Hollywood mirror so
it's going to sit up here so I would
really like this area to be quite a lot
more streamlined I've got a collection
of new nail varnishes here Sally
Hansen's new nail varnishes which I need
to try out in here is my current
foundation and like base products drawer
I've got some powders blushes got
randomly my eyelash curlers some
bronzers and then in this tin back here
is a highlight but again this is a draw
I'm gonna be pretty brutal when it comes
to clearing out moving over here this
one is filled with moisturizers and
serums and eye creams these are 10 tees
my blog of hail and boxing I've got some
oils I've got a lot of the serums and
things that I use on a regular basis and
tanning products down here it comes to
larger things I've got a huge collection
of face wipes I've got some makeup bags
in there couple of sheet masks I have
more kind of lotions and potions we've
got some moisturizers down here that I
don't use quite so regularly I've got my
makeup setting sprays some serums spare
Beauty blenders face mists makeup
setting sprays that kind of thing and
then I have a big Muji container here
which is all of my eyeshadows nobody
needs as many eyeshadow palettes I know
for a beauty blogger it's probably not
that ridiculous a collection but for me
I just don't need this many and then
behind there we've got even more sheet
masks I've got a serum which I forgot
that I had and that's a very expensive
library one I've got some more cushion
foundations some really expensive
moisturizers from Estee Lauder from
Galan la Mer I've got all these amazing
things and I forget that I've got them
because this area is so unorganized and
then my bottom drawer is hair products
mostly so this kind of basket here is
where I put the hair products and then
there's also some deodorants this is a
hairspray that I use when I'm drying my
hair hair brushes hair clips just get
pinged on the side here all kinds of
products that I use on a regular basis
and then down here I've got my clothes
Dee Haring brush I've got some
fragrances down there
this is a basket full of things that I
use for my hair like hair bubbles have
got tangle teezer got my clips this is a
fake tan that I use on my hands now
varnish remover these are amazing if you
get gel nails done they're from elegant
touch and you basically put the sachets
over your nails and it soaks off your
gels I've got quite a collection of
those hair sprays hair clips all that
kind of thing and then I have my nail
varnishes and nail files in this bag so
that is what my makeup collection
currently looks like I really just
wanted to streamline it get rid of
anything that's out of date anything
that I haven't used in a while anything
that I don't need anymore with the aim
of having my Beauty collection quite
optimistic I hope that I'm gonna be able
to achieve that um a few tips I have
done this a few times before so I would
say that my first tip is what I'm gonna
do now and that's get everything out so
line all your foundations up all your
eyeshadows and then you can really see
how much you've got hopefully that will
shock the system into making you want to
get rid of lots of them my next tip is
obviously to be quite brutal when it
comes to expiry dates but if anything
has gone a little bit goopy or if it
smells funny then you should not be
putting that near your face so be very
thorough up with that and then my third
tip is that it is a little bit easy to
get rid of things if you know they're
going to a good home so have a bag and
if things are in date and don't look
ridiculously used then that bag can go
to friends and family it so I'm going to
get that bag out now and then hopefully
some friends will be able to get a lot
more use out of these products and I
would be able to so step one let's get
all my foundations out I think that's
where I'll start and go from there
okay I've put everything out on one of
my dressing gowns just in case anything
leaks I don't want it to go on my carpet
this is my foundation collection and as
a girl with only one face I do not need
this many so hopefully we're going to be
able to get rid of quite a few of these
as you can see there's some duplicates
I've already topped up on a new one of
my by Terry cellular a CC cream for
example as that's running out I have two
of these that I recently went on a press
trip to the Cotswolds with it cosmetics
they kindly topped me up I have quite a
lot of cushion foundations as well so
hopefully can get rid of a few of those
and then I have a really big collection
of BB and CC creams because I absolutely
love them another tip that I've just
done is actually to find any makeup bags
so if you have makeup bags for when you
go traveling or if you've got a makeup
bag for when you go to the gym
make sure you empty out all the products
in those as well this whole bag means a
big clear out okay so I've got the bag
here which is going to be products to go
to friends and then I've got my bin so
I'm gonna start off with things that
need to go in the bin for example this
cushion foundation as you can see come
bail you can read the writing anymore
that is most definitely out of date so
that's gonna go in the bin equally I
know that this beauty fact this beauty
pie foundation I really really loved
using this and actually whenever I wore
it I would get compliments friends would
ask what I'm wearing but that is
definitely too old so I'm gonna put that
in the bin as well this is almost run
out I could probably get a couple more
uses out of it
in fact what I'm gonna do is put that
straight into my gym bag because I know
that within a few days that will be
empty Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation I adore this foundation but
this is most definitely over a year old
and if you flip it upside down and have
a look at the details this little pot
here don't know if you guys know this
but this is where it says the date it
says 12 M which means 12 months and I've
had this more than twelve months so that
means it needs to go in the bin I
actually think that I've had this for
more than twelve months as well this is
the Rimmel match perfection foundation
one of my all-time favorite foundations
it's one that I always reach for for
photoshoots and things like that cuz I
just love how it leaves my skin this
does actually say eighteen months in
this little pot here so I'm gonna hold
onto it do need to buy a new one no but
gonna hold on to that for now bare
minerals complexion rescue this is 12
months but I think I got this last
summer so I will hold on to that too
because it is a real favorite what I'm
gonna do is pluck out the products from
here that I think my friends would get
more use out of than me the cushion
foundation that I'm loving the most a
moment is do your dream skin and I do
have a topic for that so that's the one
that I'm definitely going to keep and
then I really love this one Giorgio
Armani not only cuz it's personalized
but also feel like it's really good for
the skin it's very lightweight so gonna
keep those two this Clarins one I did
keep in my gym bag
I've lost the cushion for that
annoyingly but I just never found my
skin was it wasn't quite enough coverage
for me but I know that a friend will
love that so that's gonna go in there
this Chanel one again I've had this in
my collection for so long but I don't
really use it it's a bit of a weird kind
of putty umm hmmm maybe this should
actually go in the bin yeah that says
twelve months and I've had that for more
than twelve months I'm gonna pop that in
the bin this is a deal one I spent a
fortune on this but I don't really use
it that much and I do have another deal
one I think this was always a little bit
too dark for me so that's going to go in
the bag for a friend to have what have
we got left ok these beauty bombs I tend
to use neutral colored Beauty but I'm so
I'm going to put the bronze one in the
one for my friends I do really like
light consistency I love BB creams I
will probably get through this with
before too long so I will keep the
backup definitely keeping this this one
I'm still trying out the youth boosting
show it to everyone so I'll keep that
yeah that's quite excessive for BB
Creams hmm maybe I should be brutal and
get rid of oh gosh no I can't do that
yet not ready I am gonna get rid of this
one because I feel like there's a lot of
hype around Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer but - no I never absolutely
love that one so that's gonna go to
friends this one was always just a
little bit too light for me so I'm going
to ditch that one as well friend can
have that once again the coverage on
this one was just a little bit too
lightweight and they always find myself
reaching for the by Terry instead of
this so that's going to go to a friend
Clinique even better glow I just wasn't
a huge huge huge fan of the consistency
of this one so that's going to
in that bag as well and I'd probably say
the same for this one double wear light
to stay in place SPF 10 I think is a
really nice product but I have products
that I prefer so I'm going to ditch that
one as well okay so I would say that we
have about half the collection this is
one of my all-time favorite foundations
so not going anywhere this I absolutely
love it's lemare I love the packaging of
this product the formula is skincare
infused and I just love how that stays
on my skin I've mentioned how much I
love that and really love lighter
formula products like BB and CC creams
so happy to keep all of those and then
these are the ones that I'm testing out
at the moment so yeah that is my new
skincare foundation collection
collection is I think it's kind of
powders and makeup products of powdery
consistency I didn't have enough powders
to do all of that but for someone that
doesn't like powders I seem to have
quite a lot so again going to be quite
brutal here a lot of these products were
kind of tucked away at the back like
these two do not even remember owning
these and a few that I know for sure I
have not used in a long time so first of
all I think this one is going to go to a
friend it's just quite a big bulky
product so I never really find myself
putting that in my handbag so that's
gonna go in the friend bag this one I'm
definitely keeping I love my lemon
powder so that's definitely going to be
kept this Laura Mercier powder I think
oh I don't know actually because I've
been really liking the YSL Souffle
powder I think I'm gonna keep that over
the Laura Mercier because I finally
loose powders a bit Fafi and I
definitely don't need to so that's gonna
go to a friend into the me and area bag
this one I like having in my handbag
makeup bag it's got a little cushion
underneath and I find it's good for
blotting any shine on my forehead
this one I've had for a long time it is
of gorgeous products the hourglass this
is the luminous light but yeah it had
this for a very long time the date on
the back doesn't seem to have one I
think powders you can probably keep for
a lot longer but how does a really
lovely product but yeah definitely to
olds that's gonna go in the bin this is
a Tom Ford palette oh that's actually a
highlight palette I might do highlights
next because I don't use highlight that
much but yeah it will save that blemish
remedy from bare minerals I do really
like this and if I've got to blemish
then it's really good for covering it up
and securing down any concealer but I
think it's old
this is twelve months and that's
definitely more than a year old so
that's going to go in the bin this again
oh well that says 30 months this is
Shawn Takei powder HD perfecting in
bronze yeah actually I don't think I've
had that as long as I thought I had so
I'm gonna keep that one this is
Elizabeth Arden again really good for
keeping in the gym bag it's a it's kind
of like a powder
but a lot more coverage than a powder
like a powder foundation but again
really good for after the gym so I'm
going to keep that one bare minerals
bare Pro foundation that this is just
like a classic product if I want a
little bit more coverage and matta
fication I reach for that so so far
these are the ones that I'm keeping BB
brush on glow Estee Lauder I've had this
for a long time and I have not used it
very much so that's going to go in at
the bag for friends something else from
Estee Lauder oh I totally forgot that I
had that that's absolutely beautiful
okay I need to use that it's really
really lovely so these are the powders
that I'm going to be keeping
here we have my highlight collection
it's not huge because I don't use
highlight that much so I often tend to
move it on to friends pretty quickly
after testing it out immediately I can
tell you that this is one that I'll be
keeping it is from Tom Ford and it's
just most beautiful pearly highlight
beautiful rose gold packaging as well so
that one I will most definitely be
keeping this one is the Charlotte
Tilbury bar of gold I really like that
but I don't use it very often so that's
going to go to friends equally this is
the shot to a very dreamy glow
highlighter maybe I should give that one
another go let's compare that to the Tom
Ford very very similar and I know I love
Tom Ford's that's going to go to a
friend then we have the mary loumanizer
this one I feel like is a blob of
favorite it is a different shade but I
don't feel like I need multiple shades
of highlight so that's going to go and
this one is from makeup revolution this
is an amazing budget highlight I think
if you don't know if you like highlights
we want to try it out then this one is
amazing but I've had this for a long
time that says twelve months so I'm
going to get rid of that put that in the
bin this is the Tom Ford I think this is
a shade and illuminate palette I never
really got to grips with this never used
it that much so that's gonna go to a
friend as well and then I'm just
comparing everything to this one so I
know I love this this is the Too Faced
palette but I've had this a long time
this does say 16 months but I think I've
had it longer than that so that's gonna
go in the bin and then I've got the wire
sell glow shot I got this quite recently
and I've been using this quite a lot
when I wants more of a creamy highlight
so those two are going to be staying
these I don't think are highlights at
all that's a Tom Ford eyes shadow
palette and then a powder should have
got this one out when I was throwing out
my powders but I don't use it that often
this brush needs a clean but I'm gonna
put that in the pile for friends and I
will save that for when we do eyeshadows
then we have this amazing palette from
hourglass which does of course have
highlight products in it and I love this
palette so much as that is definitely a
stain it was a very successful clear out
these are my remaining highlights
next in front of me I have got my
eyeshadow palettes I started to lay them
all out and then I realized that there
are far too many this is gonna be quite
tricky because I love eyes shadow
palettes and some of them I feel very
attached to but I'm gonna try again to
be quite brutal okay so this is the box
where I keep most of them there's also
as you can see the anastasia cloak it in
there this is obviously a really really
hyped up product but i don't actually
use it that much i don't know if a
friend would probably get more use out
of that than me yeah definitely
so i'm gonna get rid of that
controversially also in here we have got
oh this is not a Chavez at all this is a
contour spectrum palette from zoeva but
yeah I don't really contour so gonna get
rid of that this is a really big book
kind of it looks a little bit messy now
of eyeshadows from zoeva I do actually
really love these eyeshadows and I love
how flat this box is and I don't think
they go out of date really that much
this says 36 months so yeah I'm gonna
keep hold of that one Wow Urban Decay oh
no Kat Von D what does that say Shack
shade and light - shade and light
palette yeah I haven't really used that
that much it looks a little bit grubby
but I know that a lot of people would be
very happy to receive this and I don't
really use it so that is gonna go in
there next we have got the Naked 3
palette I used this so much this has
probably been my most used I shadow
palette ever and yet it's not you know
none of them are running out yet but how
long you meant to keep these for that
says 12 months gosh but I mean what is
an old eyeshadow really going to do to
you it's not going to be that damaging
but I feel like I should get rid of this
yeah it's gonna go I'm not going to be
sentimental it says a twelve months so
farewell this down here is a beautiful
Bobby Brown palettes and I really like
small palettes because they're very good
for traveling with so I'm gonna keep
that one this one I used a lot as well
rose
rose golden zoeva palette really like
those shades but I don't think I need
this palette I think I've got these
shades elsewhere so I'm gonna put that
one in the bag for friends we've got the
Too Faced chocolate bar palettes
really like these shades but again I
think I've got them in other palettes
and I'm gonna keep so that's gonna go in
the friend bag anastasia beverly hills
contour kit this is barely used so i
think that's definitely gonna have to go
i buy a lot of these palettes based on
hype and then i never end up using them
this is a cielo palette which i did use
a lot not that you can really tell but
it was a very well used palette but i
haven't reached for it in a long time so
that's gonna go in the bag for friends
then we've got the becca palette ahh
beautiful neutral shades see this is a
kind of thing that i need to tidy out
for because i feel like I would use this
a lot more if I remembered that I had it
that's because I had so many I've very
rarely used it so that's going back in
there along with Bobby Brown and zoeva
then down here we have some others which
didn't fit in this box previously I love
this Tarte palette it's rainforest of
the sea really beautiful shades very
nice that's gonna go in there this one
from Kiko is really good for traveling a
very very small one but I think I have
others that are good for traveling as
well so that's going to go in the friend
box this is a stealer palette I think
this was in my 2016 beauty favorite so
it's quite an old one but as you can see
just the shades are very very wearable
lots of really beautiful brown shades in
there so I'm gonna keep that one so I
did love that one a lot then we've got a
couple of Tom Ford pallets here this one
is the golden mink eyeshadow quad and I
really do like that one and Tom thought
a shadows are just dreamy and then this
one is probably the one that I use the
most
it is the disco dust palette really like
those so they're going to go back
election this one here is a brand new
Tom Ford eyes shadow palette you've got
the eye shadow quad here and then you
also have two blushed shades really
really beautiful palettes band just the
most beautiful thing to keep hold of so
that's definitely going to be kept then
we have some
poets which are quite new to my
collection this is a beautiful Marc
Jacobs palette I think that these colors
all very me very wearable so that's
going into the collection and by Terry
you might have seen this in some recent
tutorials I've been using this quite a
lot so going to keep that one as well
I'm gonna do single eyeshadows
separately so that's gonna go to the
side and then naked heat three I use
this on an almost daily basis so
definitely keeping that one so I'm very
happy that all of my eyeshadows now fit
in this box whereas before they were
definitely spilling out so so that I
would say is a job well done well as you
can see my blush collection is pretty
darn small I very rarely actually use
blusher so it's not surprising that I
don't stock on to them very much out of
these I only really reach for my bite
Harry I absolutely adore this one it's
just the most perfect shade it's kind of
like a brownie pink and I just love this
shimmery section in the middle it just
gives you the most beautiful glow and I
find I don't need highlight this
I've used it once and I actually didn't
really like it but I feel like I need to
give it a bit of a try glossy a cloud
painting dusk it's a very over hyped
product a lot of people absolutely love
it but I haven't got to that stage yet
but I'm gonna just stick with it this is
all about Eve bye
oh this is an eyeshadow palette -
totally thought this is a blush the
whole time all about Eve I shadow
palette from NARS that is actually a
really lovely selection of shades I'm
gonna put that in my gym bag because
it's just a nice little versatile
palettes Milani baked blush I do not use
this very often at all I think I bought
this off a recommendation from another
youtuber picked it up in America but
it's quite a pink like Barbie pink color
for me so I'm gonna get rid of that put
that in front leg NARS orgasm I think I
have this as like a special edition one
but I don't use it because it's too bold
for me but that one I'm just gonna give
a little bit of a Polish because it's
looking a bit scruffy and then that's
gonna go in the bag for friends this
Clinique blush is a shade that I really
do like I love the kind of dusky shades
that's going to be added to my huge
collection
and then this is a cream blush from Kiko
and I very rarely find myself reaching
for this I think this might be out of
date this says oh no yeah wow this is
six months that is not very long at all
so that's definitely out of date so that
is gonna go in the rubbish very
successful clear out of my blushes these
are the only three that I'm going to be
keeping
although I had more bronzers from this
but this is my current bronzer
collection I think I am quite good at
not keeping bronzers that I don't love
and there are some bronzers that I
absolutely bloody add or so it's not
surprising that I don't have a crazy
amount this is what I use this is bare
minerals and visible bronze this is what
I use kind of on a daily basis just to
warm up my complexion and I love it I
really like bare minerals as a whole I
feel like it's not bad for the skin it
doesn't kick up the complexion it keeps
your skin healthy so love those so
definitely going to be keeping that one
the lemare bronzer I really love I
particularly like that it's kind of
staggered so if I want something
slightly lighter I can just blend my
blush at the bottom or if I want a
darker shade I can use it at the top
definitely keeping at the bronzer from
lemare then I have my Max Factor bronzer
and to be honest I bought this as a dupe
for my hourglass bronzer which is once
again a real favorite of mine this one
is an older hourglass bronzer as you can
see I'm almost reaching pan let's see
what the date on this one is I cannot
read that because it's so old but can I
see it at the bottom of this one that
does actually say twelve months so for
that reason I'm going to get rid and bin
my older one then we have two bronzers
here from Golan again I love Galland
bronzers I have a really fabulous
selection this one is just about
reaching pan at the terra cotta and it
does say twelve months and this is
definitely more than twelve months old
so that's going to go in the bin and
then this one which has got a little bit
of a blush shade in there as well this
is the again from the terra cotta
collection terra cotta Julie tons for
natural blondes this one is going to go
in my gym bag because it's nice and thin
so it's really good for traveling around
with and then I will keep this because
sometimes if I want to do like a budget
makeup routine or something like that
it's really good and genuinely it is a
fantastic dupe for the hourglass if you
really like the effect of this you want
the glow but you don't want to spend the
money then Max Factor is amazing so
these are the bronzers that I'm going to
be keeping
all right so here we have my lip balm
collection and I actually thought this
would be a lot worse I'm sure that there
are probably a few more lip balms
scattered throughout the house because I
do tend to have them like lying around
in the bottom of handbags but these the
ones that were in this room in various
makeup bags and in my drawers so
obviously I don't need this many there
are some ones here that I can spot
instantly are quite old ones looking at
this I've tried to match them up so that
down here we've got the tinted ones
these are almost like a merge between a
lipstick and a lip balm but I definitely
don't need this many and I certainly
have got my favorites
then we've got neutral lip balms you
know and you just need a really good lip
balm I've got a few of those then we've
got some plumping lip balms a slightly
more luxurious Giorgio Armani again
slightly more affordable tinted lip
balms then we've got some real favorites
of mine either Sean sky by Terry Baume
De Rose do your lip glow really love
those a couple up here that are really
good for applying before lipstick the
clinic pep start is a really good one if
I know I'm going to be wearing a
colourful lipstick all day I will pop
that on first this one is from Galan and
it's meant to be similar in the idea
that you put it on before lipstick but
to be honest I've always found it a
little bit drying so I think I'm going
to pop that in the bag for a friend this
kills but a stick lip treatment is
really good if you just want a little
bit of color but you want lots of
nourishment as well and you don't really
fancy dipping your finger in a pot I do
prefer that kind of application to one
like this where you do have to put your
finger in the pots but having said that
I love by Terry Baume De Rose so much
that I would definitely definitely be
keeping it this one they are two of my
absolute favorites then we've got my
Burt's Bees lip balms these are really
beautiful tinted colors again I just
love the fact that they're in these
tubes
however because Burt's Bees is more
natural than many of these other lip
balms the ingredients do go off a bit
quicker because they don't have so many
preservatives these have been chewed by
the dogs as you can probably see so
because of that I think these ones are
out of date so they are going to go in
the bin this Liz Earle one also
naturally active ingredients but I've
this more recently you can see on this
one it says twelve months but that one
is quite recent ones are going to keep
that Giorgio Armani I think this one
probably is gonna live in the car at the
moment we've got a car max but I find it
quite hard when we're on the road to dip
my finger into a car max so that's gonna
be kept and go into the car you can
barely see the 12-month expiry date on
this but this is a tart lip balm I do
really like this one but I think it has
just about reached its expiration date
but I think I might try and use this one
up it's probably just about the year
mark since I've got this one so I'm
going to try and use that one up benefit
cha-cha tint doesn't appear to have a
date on it but I think I've probably had
this for about two years so that's gonna
go in the bin these two here are both
ones which kind of plump lips up I think
I prefer this one so that's gonna go in
the bag for friends this is the lip tint
from Bobbi Brown I think that I've had
this one for actually I probably only
had this one for about six months but
I'd say I do have lip balms that I
prefer to that one so that's gonna go in
the bag for friends as well
those last two that I chucked out I
think this is what I'm using instead at
the moment the Dior lip glow in this
coral shade really really liked that one
that one tends to live in my handbag
makeup bag and then down here we have
got the more tinted lipsticks and these
are all quite luxurious I would say this
one from Dior is probably the boldest
color this is the Dior Addict
in the shade five five three smile I
haven't used that one very much at all
yet so going to keep a hold of that one
this one is from Birchbox it's the Aero
boost color enhancing lip balm I do like
this one but again I think is about year
old so that's gonna go in the bin this
one from by Terry I keep in my handbag
probably my favorite lip balm at the
moment gives a beautiful pink tint to
the lips so that's gonna go straight
back in my handbag definitely keeping
that one these two I wore a lot during
summer they are very barmy really lovely
lipsticks from Dolce &amp;amp; Gabana we have a
kind of nudie shade and a coral shade
I'll probably have to get rid of these
after this summer because of their shelf
life but I think I will hold on to them
for a little bit longer and then these
Giorgio Armani ones we've got a quite
dark brown
I like mid pink color and magnetics they
all click together and then another oh
that one hasn't actually been used yet
so I think I'm gonna put this one that
hasn't been used in the bag for a friend
someone can get a lot more use out of it
than myself I think I probably have a
shade quite similar to this in my
collection already so that's gonna also
go in the bag for a friend and then this
one as I don't have a darker tinted
lip-balm I will definitely be keeping
that one similarly these two from Marc
Jacobs they're probably slightly more on
the lipstick scale than lip balm scale
but they're still very balmy and give
really beautiful colors I like both
these colors so I'm gonna be keeping
those this was probably my first tinted
lip balm or lipstick with Barney
property in it and it is the Shaun Takai
lipstick in the shade and I think this
was in my 2016 favorites and I still
absolutely love it that's all that's
left it's all the way scrolled up to the
top and in fact I'm gonna put some of
this on now this is almost definitely
out of date but I love it so much I'm
gonna just finish that one off and then
when it does run out I will definitely
be repurchasing at that one then up here
I already mentioned the kanika pep start
really good for before you apply makeup
I do really like Carmex I think I will
just keep this one this one is slightly
newer in this kind of Coralie shade but
it does come out more of a pink on the
lips this one is quite old so that's
gonna go in the bin we've got the glam
glow pout mud here I never really liked
putting my finger in the pot to get this
one out I find it gets under my nails
but it is a lovely lip balm so that's
gonna go in the bag for friends looks
Rev de miel this is one that everybody
raves about it's a very good lip balm if
you have got like mega dry lips oh
that's so annoying it says six months
and I've definitely had this for more
than six months and I think nukes
products are fairly natural so that's
gonna have to go in at the bin then
we've got the Clarins instant lip
comfort oils I really like these this
one is quite old it says 18 months but I
think I've probably had it for 18 months
so I'm gonna put that in the bin whereas
this smaller one I got in a Christmas
cracker so it's not that old so I'm
going to keep that one this is the
chordally French kiss lip balm slightly
newer I've not used it that much as you
can see but it does give a really lovely
pink tint to the lips it's only got a 6
month shelf life so I'm going to keep
that one to the top of my collection so
I remember to you
then we've got another Carmack's here
this has got the little sweetie
skinny-dip collaboration pattern on the
top there I might put that on my bedside
table because that's when I tend to use
these like hardcore comics products and
then I have an esop lip balm this is SPF
30 so this is one that I take on holiday
with me so I haven't actually cleared
out that many lip balms but I do use lip
balms a lot so I'm not going to beat
myself up too much about that
this is the one that I knew would be the
most challenging that I'm most looking
forward to attacking this section as
well this is my lipsticks and I've tried
to separate this as much as possible
that up there is the bombs which I've
already done but I have spotted a few
bombs of snuck in here like this one
this is actually a lip scrub so I'm
gonna keep that because that's quite
useful so we've got almost kind of
crayon like consistency here then we've
got some lipsticks up here some that
sticks up there and my kind of posh
lipstick collection here these are very
skinny lipsticks that was the definition
of those lip glosses and then we have
got the lip matte lipsticks because I
love a good matte lip all kind of random
ones so that I think is where I'm gonna
start this is going to be my tray for
the matte lips so I'm gonna just squeeze
that in here I'm gonna start off with
these darker shades this one is from
Bourjois this is the rouge velvet don't
think i've ever used this one before i'm
not a huge fan of these darker colors
and where i do use them i like them to
be really good-quality and i know that
they're gonna stay around on my lips for
a long time so this is the darker one
i'm gonna keep and that is from YSL this
one I can't say I've used that much this
is from Kiko I think this might be yeah
like a glossy consistency it is a matte
lip but I definitely have matte lips
that I prefer so that's going in a
friend bag again from Bourjois Rouge
velvet the lipstick this one I do
actually really like this color and for
a drugstore nude I really really really
do like this one so I think I will
definitely be keeping this but that is
not going to go in my lip stain at all
so that's going to go somewhere it's
separate from the same range I've got
this one but I don't like the pink quite
so much so that is gonna go in the
friend bag this is a really old product
this is from Lime Crime it's their
lipstick in the shade
I feel like Lime Crime has had quite a
lot of bad press recently I don't tend
to read bad press too much so I'm
playing quite ignorant here and but I do
like this shade it is quite an old
product so I'm gonna just try and finish
that one up
this is from Chanel and I know that I've
had this for about three years so that
needs to go in the bin this again from
heard of Beauty I think is definitely
out of date it's a shame so I really
love this but it is quite drying so
that's going to go in the bin as well
this is the Rimmel provoke ellipse in
the
shade your move and it's got the tint in
one end and this is a really really
long-lasting lipstick and then you've
got like a setting clear gel in the
other side although in mine it's not
clear anymore because I've obviously
used it so much this has to be about
three years old I love this product so
much but it's definitely far too old to
be in my collections that's gonna go in
the bin zoeva i do really like this one
but i haven't reached four in a long
time definitely more than a year old so
again going in the bin this is Gerard
cosmetics I don't reach for this very
often so I think this is gonna go to
friends equally with this one from the
balm meet Matt Hughes really nice one
but one that I do not reach for so bin
sorry not being friend bag what's this
Diego della Palma this is not that old
and I wish I used this more so that's
gonna go in the drawer
then we've got from la splash can't say
I've ever used this so that's gonna go
in my friend bag this I'm obsessive at
the moment Estee Lauder's lip envy in
the shade bronze leaf you may have seen
this in a recent unboxing video
absolutely adore that that's going in
the collection also Gerard cosmetics I
think I found these a little bit drying
but a friend can enjoy that this is the
slightly older packaging of the Estee
Lauder lip envy but I do really like it
I mean they are quite similar but this
one this one at the bottom here is more
mattes than new one is slightly more
matte but I do really like those two
faced melted latex now I don't love how
this looks on me but it is quite
dramatic and sometimes if I want like a
glossy lip in a video for example then I
reach for this one so I think I will
keep that one another one from jarred
cosmetics I think I must have got these
in a goodie bag but that doesn't look
like the kind of pink that I wear very
often so that's going to go to a friend
Anastasia Beverly Hills I got this
because of the hype in Sephora and I
never truly loved it so that's going to
go to a better home and then we have the
Tarte lippy lingerie same deal with this
one I bought it because I was going a
bit mad in Sephora it's actually crayon
but I don't love it so that's going to
go to a friend then we have three again
very hyped up products we've got a Marc
Jacobs lip crown here but the shade is
not very me so that's going to go and
then we've got to Kat Von D what are
these called like the tattoo lips or
something
super long lasting and but I think I'm
just gonna keep this one because that is
not a very me shade okay I'm very happy
with how many we've got rid of so far
and what should we attack next
maybe my lip glosses I appear to have
two of the exact same one from Clarins I
think they're both shade number six I've
used both of these but this one looks
like a little bit monkey so I'm gonna
put this one in the bin and keep that
one hopefully I have just chipped away
the right one the older one then I've
got a Marc Jacobs I think this is a lip
gloss yeah and this is probably one of
the only lip glosses that I do actually
like so definitely gonna keep that one
and this I believe is a very similar
product in a slightly different shade so
I will be keeping that one as well so
this is what the drawer is looking like
there's still a little bit of room in
there so I'm gonna fill it up with the
lip crayons that I'm going to keep and I
don't think there'll be too many of
these so I'm not a huge crayon fan this
is kind of Intuit brandis's nude sticks
I did really like these when I was
trying them out and the shades are
actually really really gorgeous so I'm
gonna keep that one this is from trish
mcevoy again a really nice shade but I
don't know if I can be bothered to keep
sharpening this I think I prefer them
when you roll them up so that's going to
go to a friend these are the new velour
extreme matte lipsticks from Laura
Mercier they very kindly gave me the
entire collection but I've been very
selective and I'm just keeping the
shades that I really really like this
one is called fierce and I do really
love this shade is like a brownie pink
so that's gonna stay in my makeup drawer
I think I'm gonna arrange it so it's
like matte lip products lip glosses and
then at the crayons down this end now
these are the bites Beauty mats creme
lip crayons I always buy these when I go
to Sephora and I have two shades well I
have full here but I think they're all
two different shades which are amaretto
and leche these are a bit of a go-to
when I just know that I want a really
nice matte lip that's not going to be
drying
I've loved these ever since I first
discovered them maybe four years ago and
I always buy them when I go to Sephora
so definitely keeping those I have got
two of each because I would hate for the
day to come when I run out of them then
we've got some of the Burberry kisses I
don't think that's my favorite shade of
the Burberry product so that's going to
go into the bag friends LOC love of
color this one came in a book
and that is a really really beautiful
color sorry about the focusing here it's
not really enjoying focusing on these
small products but that's gonna stay in
my collection from Elizabeth Arden this
is kind of a mixture between a bomb and
a lipstick again really love this color
in fact maybe I should get rid of the
Giorgio Armani because the Armani is
quite similar and I do prefer the
consistency of these Elizabeth Arden
ones so that's going to go in my bomb
drawer
here's another Burberry kisses this is a
shade that I do prefer it's a little bit
more like a chocolatey color so that is
going to go into the lipstick drawer and
then this is a brand new Topshop lip
bullet I think I bought this because I
ran out of the old one and at the time I
absolutely loved it but I think I have
things in my collection now which I
prefer and because this is brand new
it'd be a really nice one to give to a
friend similarly this is the Topshop
everything stick you can use this as a
crayon or you can use it on the cheeks
or whatever I normally just use on the
lips but oh wow that actually says 36
months but as you can tell us a bit old
and battered in fact this probably is 36
months old so that is going to go in the
bin these are a couple more of the Laura
Mercier velour lipsticks so these are
brand new I've got the shade vibe and
respect all of which I love I think I
chose three to keep a few of the others
I did a giveaway of so yeah these are
the three that I decided to keep so
they're gonna go in the collection and
then this is quite a new product this is
from Fendi beauty and it's a really
unusual shade I don't have any other
products of this shade in my collection
so definitely gonna hold on to that one
okay so we now have two completed lip
drawers my balms and my things we've
just done so I'm gonna bring another
drawer forward an empty one and we're
going to do lipsticks this time so I
already said I'm going to keep that one
this is a Bobbi Brown it's kind of like
a barmy lipstick very nourishing on the
lips but I think I prefer the ones that
I've got in that first drawer so I think
a friend will appreciate that more than
I will this is a brand that I've not
tried before and indeed a product I've
not tried before it's from a brand
called de corte and I've heard really
good things about these so need to keep
that and give that a go this is a
Shiseido lipstick which I absolutely
love the color of this is beautiful with
a lip liner it's absolutely stunning so
def
keeping that one this is Mac velvet
teddy which was probably one of the
first MAC lipsticks that I bought I do
really like the shade of this but I've
had this one for a long time and with
matte lipsticks you should really only
keep them for a year so that is gonna go
sadly in the bin this is from Illumina
scar I can't say that I've used this one
very much and I think when it comes to
berry lips this is probably not my
perfect berry shade so I think I'm gonna
give this one to a friend pop that one
in the friend bag this is a lipstick
from Elizabeth Arden and I can't say
that I've used this one very much it's a
really lovely Coralie shade but I think
no one's getting quite old now and I
haven't used it that much probably not
and it's expiration date yet though so
I'm going to give that to a friend we
have a couple here from the LAN we've
got this bright fuchsia pink which don't
really wear for you should that often
and then more of a nudie shade but again
I think I've got a nude lipsticks that I
prefer to this one so I'm gonna be
pretty brutal here and actually say
farewell to these they take up quite a
lot of room in my makeup drawer as well
because the packaging so yeah I do like
these but I think that I have got
friends that would appreciate them more
than I do
this is one of my favorite lipsticks
it's insatiable ivory from Estee Lauder
I'm very close to running out of this
one definitely be repurchasing and I
just love the consistency of that so
really nice feels barmy but really good
color payoff so that's definitely
staying
here's another matte lipstick I can't
even tell you the name of this once it's
run out and I very nearly reach the
bottom of this again definitely more
than two years old so that's going to
get thrown away and then I think these
two are from the Estee edit which means
they're probably about a year old this
one again probably not a shade that I'd
wear actually I think I did get quite of
wear out of that one looks like a work
quite a lot so maybe I will keep that
for a little bit longer this one however
a little bit light for me I think this
color washes me out a bit so that's
going to go to a friend I do really like
the Victoria Beckham lipsticks from
Estee Lauder this is the shade Brazilian
nude and I've worn that a lot recently
so definitely keeping it that one this I
think is the iconic red matte lipstick
in so showed but most definitely again
more than two years old so that's going
to go in the bin I do have a red to
replace it with this is from Dior it has
my name on it
and look at that such a stunning a red
color and beautiful packaging so I'm
very pleased to have a perfect red in my
collection right let's bring forward
Charlotte Tilbury this is one that I
bought fairly recently from Sephora from
Tarte I think that's a really nice shade
I need to actually wear this one because
as you can see it has not yet been used
and then I believe this is another red
lipstick from I know it's not red plum
shade it's gonna be at least autumn
until I wear that kind of color so I
think that one's gonna go to a friend
because as I said I'm pretty sure this
is like my perfect autumn color so I
don't feel the need to hold on to that
many singers I don't do a dark lip that
regularly right let's have a look at
Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks this one
here is Hepburn honey that is a really
nice one quite nude I think I'm gonna
like stand them all up to start with so
I can compare what colors I've got think
that's red carpet red this one is
Penelope pink we've got a sexy Sienna
that when I wear a lot during summer
this one is kidman kiss another really
beautiful color there and then we have
Miss Kensington I have to say I think
these two are very nude and not the kind
of nudes that are flattering on these I
think these are gonna go in the friend
bag and then I have to say I have got
Reds that I prefer to this and I don't
my red lip that often and when I do
it'll pretty be this Dior so that's
gonna go in the friend bag as well but
I'm gonna keep sexy Sienna that's one of
my summer favorites keeping miss
Kensington with a really lovely lip
liner that looks gorgeous and I'm
keeping Kidman's kiss as well or am I
I don't wear proper pink that often and
when I do I probably would go for a
liquid lipstick so actually I'm gonna be
brutal and I'm gonna put that in the bag
to give to a friend I have three
lipsticks from Estee Lauder here let's
have a look at the shades of these this
one is called decisive poppy that's a
really lovely red but diso to what I
said about Reds before I don't think
that would be the one that I would
naturally reach for this one however
it's kind of like a mix between a red
and a pink
it's called defiant coral and I know for
a fact that this suits me a lot and in
the summer if I do want a more summery
red lip then that's the one that I would
go for so going to be keeping that
one gonna slide that in next to
insatiable ivory and this one is called
volatile that name rings a bell I think
again this is a red that does really
Ricci at my skin color so that's going
to be staying in my collection right
that draw is looking good and then we
have my posh lipstick drawer my Tom
Ford's I definitely do not need this
many Tom Ford lip product so let's start
by looking at these little ones this one
is called Amber it's kind of like a gold
lipstick you can kind of put this over
the top of a different lipstick to give
it a lip simmer really fun it but not
the kind of thing that I use very often
so that's going to go to friends this
one is called Addison from their lips
and boys collection I do love this
really nice little lipstick as well so
great for in the handbag it's definitely
going to be keeping this from the same
collection this one is called Bradley
you can see the color nicely on the top
of that one in fact maybe I'll leave a
load of these open so that I can make
sure I'm not keeping too many of the
same kind of shades like they are
already very similar and then this one
is called where's I can't actually see
myself wearing that color it's a little
bit dark for me I do love a deep shade
but yeah not probably not my perfect
deep shades that's going to go to a
friend and then we've got the full size
ones deep mink this used to be like an
everyday lipstick for me I probably wear
this one more in autumn time but I will
hold on to it for next autumn still
gonna leave them open to make sure I'm
not keeping too many that are the same
this one is sable smoke my everyday
lipstick I wear this so often it's
probably in my top three lipsticks of
all time so most definitely keeping at
that one heavenly creature is the name
of this one that's a lovely shade I
should definitely wear that more so
gonna keep that one this one is called
so vain it's very similar to that first
one actually I think I prefer deep mink
so this one is going to go to a friend
this is called first time and it's a
really lovely pinky color I wore this a
lot last spring and I think I'll wear
this again in springtime a lot more so
I'm going to keep that one forbidden
pink I can I can tell by the names if
they're ones that I've worn a lot this
is not one that I've worn that much it's
still quite a lot in there and I've
definitely got friends that'll
appreciate that more so I'm going to say
farewell to that one and then I have
warm sable so warm sable and sable smoke
are two of my all-time favorite
lipsticks I love them both think I love
sable smoke a little bit more than warm
sable but it's going to keep them both
because they are beautiful so that's not
too many I've managed to cut that down
to five of the full-size tomforde
lipsticks and I do adore tomforde
lipsticks so they are going to stay in
their drawer and then these I think are
lip balms I can't say that I've used
these that much but we've got this one
which is like nude with a pink in the
middle this one is more of a purple with
a pink in the middle and then we've got
again a slightly purpley yeah I think
I'm gonna only keep one of these
ironically is the one that it doesn't
look like I've used but that does look
like a really beautiful shade this is
carry a cow is the name of this one and
I don't know why I've not used this
because it does look absolutely
beautiful so yeah but that's the
wonderful three that I'm going to keep I
could probably combine these two drawers
now but I don't really think I need to
it's not like I'm running out of drawer
space so that is how my lipstick
collection is looking at the moment
so this is the contents of this little
drawer which was originally an eyebrow
drawer but then I used to stick in like
lip liners and eyeliners and brow gels
things like that but I want to keep it
to eyebrow pencils and eyebrow gels in
here so I'm going to prop you up here as
I go through them this is an absolutely
astonishing a huge collection of eyebrow
products some of which I know that I
like some of which I know that I don't
baby
baby
I think what I might try and do next
is combine this draw to be mascaras and
eyeliners because I don't actually use
that many eyeliners so hopefully they
won't need to take up too much space I
can see I've got a few brow products in
here as well that one I don't want to
keep that one I don't want to keep this
one as s daily order I think that's
quite a good one and then another gimme
brow I'll definitely keep that as well
these two I think quite old so they can
go in the bin that Elizabeth Arden one
again is quite old and then we've got
mascaras that's a concealer that's the
concealer this is a mascara mascara
mascara lip product a mini mascara
mascara mascara okay so out of these
mascaras I haven't used that one very
much so I'm gonna give that to a friend
Tom flawed mascara is amazing that's
actually a Laura Mercier eyebrow gels
that's gonna go in there this little
mini roller lash is very old so I'm
gonna put that in the bin benefit roller
lash in brown and black I love those and
the new benefit mascara I absolutely
adore this one I have actually been
really liking lately but find it but
find it very hard to take off and I
preferred this so I'm going to give this
to a friend
L'Oreal lash paradise I really like this
one but I think mine's been open for a
little bit too long I put it on this
morning I was a bit clumpy so that's
gonna go in a bin trish mcevoy that's a
really really good one and then the it
cosmetics mascara I really like that as
well I've got a few more mascaras laying
around in various makeup bags but I will
come to those so then we've got my
eyeliner collection let's have a look at
the eyeliners
we found a difference so I'm bringing in
my concealer and eyeshadow drawers now
if I just turn this around slightly
these are very messy because as
concealer and both of them and
eyeshadows in both of them so I'm going
to separate this out into kind of
highlight concealers creamy concealers
and then more of the palate style cream
concealers
okay so there's actually quite a lot of
products here that I wish I used more
but I kind of forget that I have I tend
to reach for eyeshadow palettes more
than single eyeshadows so I'm going to
be quite brutal here as well I do really
like I shadow sticks but I don't reach
for them as often as I should some of
these are probably quite old as well for
example I know that this Chanel one is
pretty old this is from Kiko again old
nas is old Lizabeth odd and I love that
but it's old old old old so these are
all going to have to go I think in the
bin this one is amazing for holidays
it's Clarins waterproof eyeshadow it's
like a cream eyeshadow but it is very
waterproof so great for holidays then we
have a lot of cream eyeshadows a huge
amount considering I very rarely use
cream eyeshadows so going to be very
selective here Tom Ford this is a really
lovely duo you've got a nice shadow in
the top there and then a more of a balm
underneath so a more of a cream
eyeshadow need to use that more because
that looks absolutely spectacular
benefits bikini tini I think this is
called that again is a really lovely
shade a really nice oh wow that was like
broken straight away I think this is
quite old maybe I need to get a new one
of these that is really really lovely
but that's gonna go in the bin because
it looks like it's tried up this I
cannot believe I still own it is I think
it's called shroom by Mac but it was
probably the first single eyeshadow I
ever bought very well used as you can
see I don't know how I have not thrown
that away yet but that is going in the
bin
you hold me without no touch you don't
each ace to pull me back light it up
I can't speak your mind my world
slipping under give me nothing but it's
up I can't tell you
the upper building walls you break down
Oh every time I go brings back
okay it's about three hours later and
finally I put everything back in its
place if you guys are still here
Congrats because it's probably the
world's longest video but now I have a
lot more organized makeup collection I
still have my serums and my brushes on
the top here my next job is softening is
going to be washing my brushes so then
in my tower we have my lovely organized
lip balm collection we've got the tinted
lip balms we've got the plain lip balms
and the preparation ones as well then we
have got my very snazzy lipsticks I've
put my Tom Ford's in with my Estee
Lauder's and further down from that this
next drawer is the rest of my lipsticks
and my huge collection of lip liners as
well I didn't get rid of too many lip
liners because I use them a lot one more
lip drawer this is the more liquidy lip
drawer so we've got the liquid lipsticks
the lip glosses and then also the
crayons as well next drawer down I have
an empty drawer so I've decided to put
my blushes and my highlights in there
they never really had a place before so
now I know to come to this drawer for
those and then a couple of more natural
bronzers in there too next one down
again I'm not sure why but this drawer
is really stiff but I have got my
mascaras since showing you this drawer I
also found two more my Clarins one and
my dual mascara so they now live in
there as well oh and my eyeliners in
that in the back section next drawer
down is eyebrows we've got the pencils
the gels and the setting products then
I've got my eyeshadows the single ones
and I also found a new Too Faced shadow
insurance so that's in there as well to
remind me to put that on and finally at
the bottom my much reduced concealer
draw got my liquid concealers and then
my more solid ones and my under-eye
concealers too then in the drawers this
one here has my skincare looks really
full but to me this is a lot more
organized I'm very happy to have got rid
of all the out-of-date products as well
so got serums I've got any anti blemish
products eye creams tanning products and
then the
my moisturizers also got my things like
lemare concentrate and my tea tree oil
for any blemishes and then this next
drawer is my foundations and my base
products in this little glossy box I've
got the foundations a mixture of ones
that are my existing favorites and ones
that I'm trying out and then we've got
powders loose powders set powders big
bronzer here the lemare bronzer and then
my beauty blenders are all in there and
then in this drawer down here which
still looks very very full but I promise
you it was a lot more organized we've
got my mists and again since I just
showed you clearing these out I found
this VC one which is not really a makeup
setting spray but more just instant
hydration and moisture refreshing mist I
really love this one on holiday that I
found in my handbag and this is a new
one from la Mer which is very luxurious
this was in my blogger mails I've added
that to the collection got a couple of
body lotions here sometimes I just need
a bit of moisturization in this room so
I've got the Brazilian I think that's
called like the bum bum cream or
something and then this one smells
amazing it's bronze goddess Estee Lauder
I've got some sheet masks here and then
my a few face wipes a very small
collection of false eyelashes I don't
wear them that often but these are just
some very natural ones these are my
miscellaneous tubs so I've got my top up
for when my cushion foundation runs out
I've got my body oil perfume and then a
mini micellar water for any trips that I
go on this little section you just saw
me have a clear through of there I've
also put my eyelash curlers in there
then my palettes this is where they live
I also found my bare minerals palette
which is actually quite similar to this
hourglass one I've put in my night
capsules again these tend to come with
me on holiday I have a separate tub on
my bedside table spare makeup bags go
there my spare cushion Foundation and
