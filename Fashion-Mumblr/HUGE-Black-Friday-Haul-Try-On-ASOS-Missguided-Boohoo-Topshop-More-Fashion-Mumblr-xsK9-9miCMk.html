you're having a super weekend today's
video is a little bit from unplanned one
and I wasn't planning on hosting today
in the evening I am filming this on the
day that it's going live so it's Sunday
today and it's cyber weekend this
weekend so I thought I'd do a little
last-minute a whole video of all the
things which I've picked up so far in
the sales and I know that a lot of these
things are still massively reduced so
I'm going to list all the discount codes
down below and I actually did a whole
blog post full of the discount codes for
cyber weekend and I know tomorrow if
you're watching this on the day that
goes like this is Cyber Monday so
there'll be tons and tons of new
discounts going like tomorrow so yeah I
thought I'd film a haul because looking
around me I have literally picked up so
much stuff on Black Friday I might send
some of this stuff back because it's a
little bit crazy how much stuff I've got
around me it's actually really
ridiculous but anyway I thought I would
show you what I picked up and maybe some
of it is still available so if you guys
really like the bargains I found then
you can pick them up as well so I really
did shop from loads of retailers on
Black Friday and actually on Thursday as
well so through the retailers did
release their sales a day early they
were getting ahead of the crowd and I
did tweet links to loads the products
that I was buying so looking around me
I've got a load of stuff from ASOS Miss
Selfridge misguided Kurt Geiger pretty
little thing and public desire so quite
a lot to get through so no more rambling
let's get started I'm gonna start with a
sauce because it's quite a big box
just want to get it out the way so the
deal with ethos was 20% of everything
now I know that they do student discount
sometimes they're just 20% off
everything but as it was Black Friday I
just got in really spending mood and
I've gone a sauce premiere account which
means my stuff was delivered really soon
so that was super and also I believed
tomorrow or depending on when you're
watching this today cyber monday is also
20% off so hopefully some of this stuff
might still be available if you really
like it first thing I picked up was this
pair of sunglasses and they are from a
brand called
and expects and I actually featured a
pair of their sunglasses in an esop
school a long time ago this power in
particular I thought were really nice
because they've got kind of like a
frosted marble effect on the outside and
I do still love to wear sunglasses in
winter and I just saw these were a
really nice kind of almost a festive
pair
they've got gold bands or do Portsmith
arms they've got a gold arm with the
same kind of frosted white switch bit
fit which goes over your ears and now
kind of a cat eye shape which i think is
the shape that most suits me probably
not when my hair is tied up I think a
little bit crazy but yeah so these are
20% off I really love those I'm hoping
that I'll have a winter Sun holiday I'm
going a few books yet and that I can
wear those at all like this for then I
picked up this which i think is just a
really cute gift idea I think it's yeah
it's from a brand called bando which I
actually spotted first in Selfridges and
I really like all their stuff they have
some really cute stationery but this is
a thermal flask and it says but first
coffee really nice pink lid it's really
large as well so you could definitely
fit like a full sized Starbucks in there
I actually got this as a gift one of my
friends his birthday is coming up soon
and she asks he loves her coffee and I
thought doesn't make a really nice
present for her 20% off of getting cut
remember the prices but I'll leave all
the links
also from a sauce I picked up this pearl
hair bubble so as you can see I like to
wear my hair in a bun quite a lot I'm
quite lazy when it comes to my hair and
I thought this would make just you know
like a quite pretty addition to a hair
button yeah it just kind of adds a
little bit of something nice for those
days and you really can't balance do
anything with your hair like today it's
a Sunday so I'm sorry if you're not
offended by my grace head start today
but I just thought it'd be nice to get
this video out that Kimber's deal with
um curling and straightening my hair
anything so yeah this pearl hair bow I
think is quite a nice little addition
you will have already seen all of this
stuff if you follow me on snapchat I did
a haul the second that arrived which was
actually on Black Friday itself
so definitely follow me on snapchat if
you want to see more hauls and general
me rambling about life lots of puffy
pictures as well then I got a pair of
jeans these are just kind of a normal
rips pair of jeans and I think that a
sauce own-brand yeah a sauce denim so I
got these because I do love a good pair
of dark brown brown tongue blue ripped
jeans I have a pair from FUBU which was
only 22 pounds which I absolutely love
but they're almost too ripped now that
it's getting a bit cold they make my
legs a little bit chilly so I thought
I'd get these because they're slightly
less ripped than the boohoo ones and
then speaking of boohoo I actually
bought some ruku things from ASOS as
well who had a really good sale
themselves I think they were like up to
50% off on loads of things but as I said
I'll leave all the cyber monday and
sudden we can't discount rates down
below but because I was making an a
source order I decided to pick up some
googly things from ASOS and they are
these boots which are over new boots
with really nice cut and tied fastening
at the top which is quite similar
the Russell promised year why someone's
but these are a lot cheaper I believe
there are around the 30 pound mark but I
can't remember promised you only by the
information down below chunky heel which
I lux makes them really easy to walk in
I do have the Stuart Weitzman version of
fools at Highline boots not with the tie
at the top with the elastic around the
back my mother all the time and these I
think are the best cheap price wise
although these are got a pointer to and
I think mister away someone's have got a
rounded toe I think I've got a lot of
use out of these and then lastly from
ASOS the exact same boots but in a brown
color and you're gonna kill me when you
see what else I bought from coat Geiger
because yeah that's just say I've got a
bit of a shoe problem but I think these
are probably even less than 40 pounds
for bought two pairs I just went a
little bit crazy and I wear boots pretty
much all the time in winter weather it's
ankle boots or knee-high boots or over
the knees so I thought you know these
are a really good price and they look
like they're gonna give a really good
fit as well so looking forward to trying
these on next I'll talk about Topshop
just because I've got these in front of
me I actually went into the store on
Friday or maybe even Thursday and they
already started their sale and I picked
up these shoes now these are absolutely
gorgeous I'm not sure if they're gonna
be online I'll have a little look and
leave a link if they are but these were
56 pounds down to 35 so that's almost
50% off and I just thought they're so
lovely for the party season coming up
obviously they're rose gold they've got
the tassels so lots of kind of trend and
funky functions so it's a kind of
trendabl I went up so lots of trend
features on these ones love the color I
love the heel height it's not crazy high
I'm not sure they're going to be too
comfy because they don't have a platform
but I thought 435 pounds and I've got
lots of Christmas parties coming up
these would look really really cute so
they were from a Topshop so this weekend
pretty little thing have their PL T's
fiber party and they are doing 30% off
and the first thing that I picked up was
this burgundy wine colored and
sleeveless coat sleeveless relay but
it's got a really lovely waterfall
detail around the neckline and also a
tie way
storage is actually fallen off but I
love to wear things like this during
winter I think this will look lovely if
I'm wearing like a black roll neck or
that polo neck and I'll just add
something a little bit more smarts to an
outfit which could just be jeans in a
long-sleeved top I really love the color
and it was such a good price as well I
thought it was I'm really sorry but yeah
I will leave a link to this down below
and I just think I'm gonna get a lot of
use out of something like this in autumn
and winter and it's a kind of color
which boys keeps on coming back in
fashion so love that one but when I'm
more excited about that I got three
pretty little thing is surprise surprise
another pair of over knee boots now I
know I'm going to have to send some
pairs backers wait till the end of this
video I've picked it up no less than
five pairs or over new boots but these I
absolutely fell in love with the color
they are so similar to the Stuart
Weitzman once again with the chunky heel
and they've got a bit of a platform in
there as well and they've got the tie at
the top so so similar to the Stuart
Weitzman's I'm noticing this color is so
gorgeous
it looks really really lovely with white
jeans actually wore these on my birthday
evening with white jeans and they just
look absolutely gorgeous I'm so pleased
with these then we have public desire
and this is a website that I've never
shopped on before but I kept seeing on
my Twitter feed loads of really good
bargains so the first thing that I've
picked up is this pair of boots and
these look really similar to a pair on
Topshop I think the Topshop pair they
didn't go down itself I believe they
were like 89 or 90 or 80 pounds and
these I paid 28 pounds for in the sale
again I was so so chuffed with these um
and I just think they're really
beautiful and love this kind of tort or
show affection on the heel and the heel
is not too high so I think these are
going to be one that I wear a hell of a
lot okay during the winter season
they're black which is really practical
they did have them in suede as well and
I think
these black jeans quite a lot over the
next few months and I got another pair
of shoes from public desire actually to
make up the minimum order for free
shipping but I do really really like
them and it's this pair here they've got
the kind of I think this is called the
paper bag effect where it's kind of
scrunchie on the bit that goes around
your ankle correct me if I'm wrong but
they've got a tassel detail here which I
think makes them look really nice I'm
not too sure I wear these with I think
I've tried them with white jeans maybe
tights and the suede skirt but yeah I
thought they were lovely and all
together my daughter didn't even come
250 pounds that's really pleased with my
bargains from public desire next up is
misguided and I made an order I think
yesterday that said well Friday I'm not
sure but I got thirty percent off the
order so I picked up a few things which
I kind of had my eye on for a little
while I also picked up this which is an
iPhone 6 phone case which has like a
lace design on the back so this was 6
pounds 30% off six pounds is like one
pound 8d I think in my months is not
very good so yeah this was like four
pounds something for pound 20 which i
think is really really fab I'm actually
getting new phones soon hopefully
upgrading to 6s but actually bought this
my boyfriend's a little sister because
she's got an iPhone 6 I think it's just
such a good stocking fillers they're so
pretty and cheese chips I'm just gonna
basically buy these separately that I
don't because they're really really cute
also from misguided this lace dress now
this I thought would just be so lovely
for a few Christmas parties that I've
got coming up I don't have many white
dresses that are suitable for this time
of year or my white dress is a kind of
more summery but I thought this one was
lovely it's very high neck and it's kind
of it's going to be quite body from
figure father figure hugging and it's
got a lovely kind of Scarlett
detail at the bottom I'm not sure you
can see but the links have scallops at
the bottom the fact that it's
long-sleeve and it's got a double lining
inside the main bodice area I think will
make this quite a nice warm one I don't
really like new tights but I might be
tempted to wear new types if I get cold
or maybe even black tights and some
black sparkly heels or something so I'm
excited to give this a go and I had to
have my eye on it for a little while so
when a 30% off came in my inbox I was
like yes now is the time but by far my
favorite purchase from misguided and by
the way oh yeah know that I have got a
lot of shoes here but I just think the
shoes can be quite expensive and when
you see really really lovely ones that
are just so cheap in the sale these are
pretty good price anyway but in the sale
and just absolutely crazy I picked it up
these from misguided are getting a pet
I've had my eye on for so long I just
think that's so elegant and then look I
think it's like the singer on ones that
they look really similar to they've got
the pointy toe and the gold heel and I
just think they are absolutely stunning
I was sorting out my winter shoe
collection the other day I was switching
out my spring/summer stuff my autumn
winter and it actually was a little bit
lacking in the shoe department so I
thought I'd stock up and these I think
they were again like under 30 pounds so
absolutely crazy bargain from misguided
the sale discount that misguided are
doing is changing all the time so I was
really lucky that I picked those up when
it was 30% off but I am updating the
blog post with all the discount codes as
they happen so have a little look at the
blog post which are linking down there
because the discount code said I'm
talking about right now may not be
relevant for today or even cycle Monday
but yeah keep it on the blog post
next is the Miss Selfridge and I haven't
even opened this one yet
do your profit first impressions
together so the Miss Selfridge sale they
had loads of different discounts and it
was up to 50% off but loads of things
were different prices might think
they're continuing to slash them
throughout the weekend the first thing I
picked up was this absolutely gorgeous
pink and it feels like wood it's gonna
be one of those super duper warm winter
coats and I have a lot of winter coats
again but nothing quite as classic as
this so this is a very long I'm not
going to be able to show you the bottom
whew yeah really really long it's
probably gonna make me look like a dwarf
so definitely need to try this but it is
a wrap around the waist
SuperDuper warm and soft coat from Miss
Selfridge now this would have been 95
pounds but according to my receipt I
paid 66 pounds for this so what's that
like around the 35 40 percent off mark
and I just think hopefully this is gonna
fit me because it's a classic item again
and it's just so beautiful I love this
color this is definitely my favorite
color for outerwear and just you know
wearing it right now
yeah I think this is absolute gorgeous
I'm really excited to try this on
fingers rustic Fence and I also got
another coat from Miss Selfridge this is
a faux suede shearling coat now I used
to think like this to have something
like this for Topshop but went missing
like I have no idea where this protest
probably in a dry cleaner somewhere that
I no longer live but this one used to be
65 and I paid 45 pounds of it so got
another really good bargain it's got the
zips on the sleeves it's a nice
additional detail and it's kind of
double-breasted you know when the zip
across the body beautiful soft faux fur
here and faux sheepskin on the inside so
getting really excited to try this one
on because I mean the sheepskin kind of
easier to jacket like this is such a
classic piece I actually picked up two
sizes too poor or weirdly I've got quite
broad shoulders so hopefully this fits
me again fingers crossed because yeah
such a big bargain it's two coats fans
or hundred pounds I think that is
amazing
and lastly we're finally going towards
the end hopefully this is not going to
be a mega long video my two probably
favorite purchases of the entire haul if
you follow me on snapchat you would see
me prancing around in these colors so
much and equally I've been chatting
about them on Twitter non-stop and it is
these two pairs of boots I've got the
beige and the grey from Kurt Geiger so
these are the ultimate Stuart Weitzman
tubes now the street lights on ones I
think the ones with the tie at the back
like these ones are approaching the 800
pound mark probably like in the 700 to
800 pound mark and I have had them on my
wish list for so long now I know what
you're thinking I have already got the
public desire ones here and the ones
that I got from boots are definitely new
so I definitely need to make some
decisions and not people with them
because I is actually ridiculous on top
of the ones which I've already owned
before this whole thing happened but I
did try these on and oh my gosh they
absolutely have at least some fees were
20% off on a Kirkuk website and still
are so definitely head on over if you're
looking for some Stewart was when jeeps
I paid 152 pounds each for these boots
but when you think how expensive the US
Army pair are then I think it's such a
good saving and I honestly really really
wanted the steer Weitzman ones from
Russell Bromley so I think I did well
picking up these ones the great ones
look absolutely gorgeous if you saw my
last
whole video which is like a birthday
haul I picked up a gorgeous gray Topshop
jumper and these just looks stunning
with that and white jeans so I've got
some tough decisions to make because I
know it's actually ridiculous keeping
all the boots I think I unreal II in
Cline's keep the Kirk IV ones just
because you're paying for the quality at
the end of the day not that the others
are going to be poor quality but I just
think the Kirk I got ones do look
absolutely stunning and I have tried
them both on and perform in love with
them so I don't really think I can send
them back after falling in love with
them I think I'm definitely also keep
the pretty little thing ones these ones
because sometimes it's raining and you
still want to wear boots but you don't
risk ruining your 150 pounds one so I
think these ones will definitely be a
keeper as well if you have to keep these
anyways I wore out my birthday so yeah
no choice about these but now I'm really
happy to keep those so I'm going to give
a lot of thought about the foodie ones
maybe keep a black pad because you know
you can never have too many Oconee boots
so that's it guys I really hope you've
enjoyed looking through all of these
lovely pieces of me I'm sorry I didn't
get to try everything on in front of the
camera for you like I normally do but
it's a Sunday after all and I've got
stuff that I want to be doing and I also
want to chill and watch bit Harry Potter

haul video and hopefully a lot of this
stuff might still be in stock so you can
grab yourself a bargain as well I'm
gonna leave the links to everything down
below and also the blog post which has
all the discount codes so you can just
