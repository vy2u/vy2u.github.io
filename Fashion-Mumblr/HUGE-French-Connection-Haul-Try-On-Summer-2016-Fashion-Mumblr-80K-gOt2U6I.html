whole video here on the fashion mumbler
youtube channel yes another haul video I
have gone a little bit crazy recently I
don't know what it is but I do know what
it is it's all these amazing
spring/summer trends I just cannot
resist and today's haul video is a
ginormous one from French Connection I'm
so excited to show you all the pieces
that I picked out because honestly are
in a pile over there and just looking at
them is making my heart flutter there
are so many gorgeous pieces that I did
go a little bit crazy on the website
it's as though their whole summer
collection was designed with me in mind
I know obviously it wasn't but with all
the troubles that I have coming up I
just feel like these quotes are going to
be so perfect there's a huge amount of
clothing and accessories that I want to
show you
so no rambling intro let's get started
I'm going to kick off with accessories
because that's what I want to do and the
first thing that I picked up was this
gorgeous brown leather handbag now I was
really attracted to the straps in this
one it looks a little bit kind of street
marketing if that makes sense kind of
thing you might pick up on your troubles
but actually it's from UK high street
it's as gorgeous tan leather and it's a
very kind of texturized leather on the
top here with a smoother I think you
call this kind of like a girl's green
leather but might have made that up and
you have two different types of leather
in the main body of the bag it's really
big so for my next trip which is
Lanzarote I could probably take this as
my hand luggage because I'm sure it will
fit my laptop in there I've got a
macbook pro really really love the
handles you've got this kind of colorful
rope and then some gold detail there and
then the chain straps inside it's just
absolutely gianormous
it's just this one big pocket section
I've got a few of the you know the paper
stuff it comes inside and then there's
also a zippy section as well which is
really handy for like any coins my
lipstick passport if you're using it for
a travel bag the only annoying thing
that I have noticed is that these don't
stay central so I guess every time I
pick the bag up again I'm gonna have to
kind of recalibrate them if that makes
sense I think this is a really really
gorgeous bag this was 90 pounds so not
cheap so I do plan on wearing this a lot
this summer to get the most use out of
it I also picked up a hat and I know
you're thinking I did not need any more
summer hats I've seem to have a beach
hat similar to this in every single haul
video I've been doing recently but what
is so great about this one is it really
is collapsible so because of the way
that the straw has been almost knitted
it just you can crush it down and then
pop it out of your suitcase and it
doesn't have any dents in it like that
more kind of glue bonded straw if that
makes sense a lot of the hats you see
like my show me one from H&amp;amp;M it's bonded
with glue so it's very stiff so once you
ruin the shape in your suitcase it's
really hard to get the shape back but
this one when it arrived in the box was
completely flat and now it has sprung
back into its shape and I just think
it's a really lovely very classic Beach
hat so really good for those trips where
it's hand luggage only and most of time
I come back when I travel it just gets
in the way and it's got a beach ribbon
very chic and yeah really really big
this hat then I picked up a couple of
swimming costumes the first one being
this Navy one and it's got a kind of
white and grey and pale blue feather
design on it which I thought was very
elegant this was actually inspired by
and she doesn't even own it I just
thought this very her an instagramer or
blogger that I'm obsessed with at the
moment called Okochi or her name's
Leonie she's the German blogger and I
just thought this kind of was very her I
thought that if she saw it she would
really like it and and I thought that it
would look out so you gorgeous some days
on the beach I just don't want to have
my tummy out especially when you go to
places like Greece and food is so good
but so bloating like there's all kind of
deep-fried cheese and that kind of thing
so sometimes you just don't want to have
your tummy out on the beach so I did
pick up a couple of swim costumes this
one I really love the shape I love the
kind of like a boob area I'm really flat
chested so I don't like anything that's
too cleavagey whereas this I think will
just add a really kind of feminine shape
and it's nice and high on the legs as
well so shows a bit of thigh and not
sure what you call that area on the legs
that this reveals I don't know but I
just thought it was a really lovely
shape love the pattern very elegant very
classic and it's got adjustable straps
as well so it's a good a good fit I did
pick up another swimming costume that
I've just realised I dropped it when I
was carrying my stuff downstairs so I'll
show you that one right at the end so
onto clothing actually the first thing
I'm going to tell you about is this
blouse here because otherwise I'll
forget this is a kind of three-quarter
sleeve jumper
I say jumper it's not going to keep you
that warm because as you can see there's
lots of see three sections on it it's
got diamond cutouts to almost look a
little bit feathery because they've got
this thread running through the Diamonds
I just thought is really pretty a very
simple top great for if you want a teeny
bit of warmth maybe it's maybe there's a
cool breeze on your holiday and you just
want to have a little bit more material
on you but without being too hot I just
sicknesses it's white it's very classic
very easy to wear and I will probably
wear this a lot when I'm traveling the
next thing is a pair of shorts I find
lace shorts just so lovely for summer
holidays these have got pockets and I
absolutely just love having pockets and
shorts not sure what my obsession is
with pockets but I just think it's
really nice detail and then it's got a
scalloped lace detail down on the bottom
I think once my legs get a little bit
more tanned if these are going to look
absolutely gorgeous then we have the
first top and this is a blue and white
folk style top it's got a lovely kind of
I want to call this string but it's not
the right way to describe it kind of
stringy tassel detail fastening here and
as you'll see from a lot of this haul
it's all kind of a little bit 70s Chloe
boho style so this is a I'd say this is
like a flair sleeve top and then you've
got this detail at the bottom I'm not
sure the official term but it's kind of
like a I call it like a ladder detail
where a lot of the hem is actually
see-through so this holes in it thanks
to the way the stitching has been done
trying to show you about not sure if is
very successful and I think it's a
really lovely design detail you've also
got that kind of ladder detail down at
the bottom here and then at the front
section you've got this almost clear
lace panel so I'll have to wear some
nice underwear when I wear this one and
you've got the same lace panel going
through the back so I think this will be
really nice light top to wear in warmer
climates and also here when it's kind of
festival season it's very good for that
kind of a that kind of vibe and a
completely different vibe but also just
as lovely I picked up this really
slouchy kind of crop top jumper now not
too sure in what kind of situation I'm
gonna wear this maybe maybe I don't like
shopping trips in the UK when it's a
warm day but it's a really thick
material it's definitely jumper material
but it's t-shirt length sleeves a really
wide scoop top and then a crop so I'm
definitely going to try this on with
some high-waisted trousers I think this
will look really cute and preppy and you
guys know how much I love plain white
tops so this is one of those things I
think I'll get a lot of wear out of this
summer however it was fifty pounds which
is quite pricey for something not I'm
not too sure how I'm gonna wear it if
that makes sense so I'll put this one to
the test I won't take the tag off I'll
leave it in my wardrobe if I haven't
worn it after two weeks then it will get
and that's my that's my test for if I'm
going to keep things I keep the tags on
I haven't won it in the first two weeks
then doesn't make the cut next and this
one is a little bit what's going to
obsessive excess so if that's the word
this is the third dress that I've got
from French Connection you might have
seen the white one that I wore in Hong
Kong I'll try and insert clip here if I
can find one and then I wore the blue
and white shirt style one in South
Africa so this is the third kind of
fit-and-flare dress that I bought from
French Connection this season and I love
them so this one has got a very cute
kind of sculpt Peter Pan detail collar
and then it's got these stripes down the
middle at the bowlers bodice which makes
it a little bit kind of chambermaid II
but I do think that's very cute and then
the skirt of it is this almost linen II
but I think it is cotton material with
some bubble detail on it which
definitely won't be picked up on camera
but does give it a lovely level of
detail you've also got that sculpt edge
down here I just think these dresses are
so gorgeous for in the evenings on a
holiday or in summer and also if you
have any things going on in summer like
maybe you're going to the Polo or going
some horse races this is perfect for all
the dress code regulations it covers the
shoulders its knee length and so I just
love having things like this in my water
for summer next another dress and this
one has got even more kind of beautiful
detailing on it the fabric itself it's
not quite lace but it's definitely got
like a lacy kind of overlay but it's not
as freely in floral as lace it's got
almost like a geometric pattern over the
top and then you've got this beautiful
long that's stand up and show you
beautiful frill detail down at the
bottom this is almost like a silky kind
of fabric coming down here up the shape
of it is fit-and-flare so it fits in at
the waist and then flares out a little
bit and I find this v-neck and this
shoulder style really flattering on my
body shape I have got slightly wider
than average shoulders and so I find
this shape really really flattering it's
pure white as well which means there are
going to be so many ways that I can wear
this with my new Valentino bag and maybe
my
sandals but equally with maybe some flat
brown gladiator sandals I think also
look absolutely gorgeous this was 135
pounds so so I need to think of a few
occasions I can definitely wear this
because it's not the kind of dress that
I want to wear and just wear one simply
that makes sense
it's too much money for that so I will
look at my diary and plan some summer
occasions so this dress will work for
back to tops and this is one that I'm
actually not too sure on I'm not sure
whether I'm going to keep this because
firstly it was 90 pounds which is very
expensive for a top and also I'm not
hugely an embellishment kind of person
firstly when I go on holiday I find it
really really heavy so it kind of weighs
down the suitcase but having said that
this one isn't too heavy and but it's an
off-the-shoulder top with these straps
which mean it doesn't actually fall down
and then you've got the embellished
detail along the neck along the sleeves
and along the bottom it is a very very
pretty top but it is expensive I think
with jeans this will look absolutely
gorgeous on a few different holidays but
it's just too expensive for a holiday
top in my opinion so we'll see I'll try
this on if it looks amazing then I will
consider keeping it but for now I'm
thinking it might be one for the return
pile this next one is one you definitely
need to see on because it's really hard
to show you here but it is a beautiful
long legged jumpsuit with a beautiful
halter neck detail at the top it's Navy
and I don't really wear that much Navy
so it's can be really interesting to add
a new kind of color entire wardrobe and
yes I did just hit myself in the head
with a coat hanger and but it's I really
like the fact that it's a halter neck I
think halter neck is really nice when
you've got a tanned back you want to
show off your lovely tan shoulders
really really nice for the summer time
and I also love this detail around the
waist I think this is going to make it
really flattering make my legs look nice
and long and I think pairing this with a
pair of super high wedges is also going
to give that lovely
tea Chloe kind of vibe so really looking
forward to styling this one up onto the
last few pieces now now all bottoms
firstly or nearly lastly I picked up
this pair of shorts they are a beautiful
tie-dye print in a white and navy blue I
don't own anything with this print on it
before but I've seen it in quite a few
like fashion editorials I've seen at my
Instagram quite a lot and this material
is so lovely in light that I just cannot
wait to wear these over my bikini
bottoms with like a plain white t-shirt
on the beach I think they're going to
look so gorgeous I actually found out
the other day I've been invited on a
trip and I can't quite believe it on
board a yacht going around Greece for a
few days so I think this will just be
absolutely gorgeous for that because
Greece if you've been in the middle of
summer it is so hot you don't want much
material at all on your skin when you're
going from lunch so I think this kind of
thing over my bikini at lunchtime is
going to look beautiful and not let me
get too hot either so love these shorts
and then also picked up a skirt which is
similar kind of prints this almost
Dimond you almost peacock feather we
print to the first top that I showed you
however this is a size six but it looks
really really big so I'm going to have
to tie in this string kind of tassel to
make it fit and but hopefully it'll be
quite nice like high-waisted skirt
because if it wasn't high-waisted and it
might be a little bit too long for me
it's also got this lovely ladder detail
down at the bottom and and the same kind
of embroidered detail at the top so it
really does match the first top that I
showed you but I definitely went where
them together because that would be a
bit of a clash then I have these lace
collapse again I say lace but it's not
really floral lace I wish I knew the
definition of this I'm sure it's
probably just called lace I just always
think lace is floral and either way
these are a pair of high-waisted clots I
really hope these fit I'll be inserting
clips of me
here's your be able to see and that they
just I can imagine he's looking so
gorgeous with a white top or even a Navy
top with wedges I think they look so
stunning
they've got pockets so I'm happy with a
pocket situation and then they've got
beautiful almost scalloped lace detail
down at the bottom really pretty and
really pretty finishing along the bottom
there I think these are going to look so
classic so expensive in reality they
were a 190 pounds actually they were
quite expensive but I think they are
going to look so stylish so classic and
so elegant on my summer trips and here's
a swimming costume that I dropped on my
way down it's not quite in my opinion as
nice as the first one I think I prefer
the classic pattern of the first sewing
costume but I do love my bright colors
when it comes to swimwear so I picked
this one up it's got the little hole
detail here so it's going to show a
little bit of skin and then the pattern
on it is really hard to do this I think
it's almost like crystals or rock or
something but again I really like to cut
at the bottom it's got this high kind of
leg gap area here and this one you could
wear without any straps so nice to get a
nice tan shoulder area whereas the other
one does have to have the straps in
order for the boob area to look good so
this one I think will be better for
tanning and again covering the tummy so
good for those after lunch situations
and that's everything actually didn't
take as long as I thought it would so
hopefully this hasn't turned out to be a
45 minute long video hope you guys have
enjoyed looking through my massive
French Connection haul I know it's
incredibly excessive but as I said I
just get so excited when I see spring
summer trends coming along and
