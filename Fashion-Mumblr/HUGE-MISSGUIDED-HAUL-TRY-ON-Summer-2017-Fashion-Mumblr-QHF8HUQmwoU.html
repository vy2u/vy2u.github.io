to be a misguided haul for me misguided
in the retailer that I don't check all
the time but when I do I always
surprised myself with how many lovely
bits and bobs they've got there at the
moment they've obviously got there some
holiday bits and pieces but for me those
Beach fives bikinis and some inexpensive
kind of cover-up so I made what appears
to be quite a large order I was kind of
embarrassed even dragging a bag this big
down the street so I'm going to get
straight stuck in that and I feel the
need to also do a disclaimer about my
plucky appearance with someone filming
this on the hottest day of the year
don't ask me why it seems like a wise
plan so and as with all my calls
everything will be linked down below
along with what I'm wearing my lipstick
and you guys know the drill we will be
affiliate links which I know you're all
cool with in fact I can move another
youtuber recently and she had a really
good quote about it she said affiliate
links are like giving someone a tips but
you don't have to pay for it I thought
that was really good so a nice coming
back oh so that was a quote so if you
don't want to learn about all the
information about finding success down
below so anyway I will get started with
these two tops which looks very very
similar but they are different
I promise they are made from this really
beautiful lightweight kind of treated
material they looked up to stunning on
the website and really really
lightweight it's perfect for days like
today when it's sweltering hot and you
just don't want too much thick material
on your body I think the effects of
these is really stunning you've got a
secluded edge I don't know if they've
achieved this is wiring or if it's just
the thickness of the stitches but it
just gives a really lovely further
effect so this one is off the shoulder
it's got some elastic here I mean it's
very basically made when you spend like
20 pounds hope you don't expect it to
have beautiful lining etc but for the
price the effect of this is really
really pretty and because I love the
fabric so much I picked up a great
similar top very very similar in fact
but this one has one more piece of
elastic just to pull in
waste so obviously I'm not going to keep
both of them I'm going to try them both
on and you guys let me know as well
which one you prefer I think maybe the
one without the elastic could be quite
nice and floaty but this one could be a
really lovely silhouette so let's give
them both to try and decide which one's
the key okay the hair is up because it
is just too hot to have my hair done any
more top wives over to as you can see a
little bit see-through you can see my
strapless bra but I guess that's kind of
to be expected with this type of
material I think if you've got a cute
like colorful bikini it could be quite a
nice design detail this is obviously the
pulling at the waist one I do really
like this shape and this I just
absolutely love this style of material
really really pretty I love the off
shoulder I think this is just so like
cute and feminine and it is really
lovely and lightweight this also I feel
is the kind of thing that's not going to
crease in your suitcase so a really easy
holiday option um yeah I think it's
gonna be a really nice like dress up or
dress down piece very practical so this
is the pull in waist style and then this
is the one without the extra elastic
around the waist I actually feel like I
prefer this one it seems to have a lot
more of a chilled out vibe about it I've
had both where's my favorite little
denim shorts these you may recognize
from my OB the whole video which I'll
leave somewhere on the screen and
definitely check that one out I filmed
it in Ibiza and it's probably my
favorite hole in a long long time but
yeah let me know what you guys think but
I'm definitely preferring this top I
really like the fluted sleeves love this
detail around the neckline love this
detail even more I just feel like it's
really kind of easy breezy summer vibes
and more relaxed in style than the one
with the waistband but that's my opinion
let me know what you guys think down
below next up and I feel like this could
be one that looks amazing on the website
but not so much in real life it is a
really lovely little place suit I really
like this floral design it's almost like
a late summer kind of color palette
you've got some dark blues in there some
oranges as opposed to more a spring
floral color palette
it looks to be really nice shape it's
got some ruffles among the sleeves it is
a little played suit so it's find that
it's short because it's shorts instead
of a dress going to look up at the back
I think actually once this is irons and
maybe with a statement gold necklace and
some lovely gold sandals this could be a
really easy to check on piece before
there's some holidays so again let's
give this a try okay so I've got some
positives and negatives about this one
positives I really love the pattern
really love this ruffle detail really
love how easy it is to throw on you just
got this one big long zip at the back
which I haven't managed to do it
completely by myself and it just makes
it really easy to throw on I think that
for kind of like weekend outfit where
you just want to stick something on and
know you look cute this is amazing
negatives though I think the material is
quite low quality it's quite cheap
material which means it has creased
really badly in the packaging and I
think it will crease really badly in the
wash as well so definitely want to iron
and if like me just CBA with ironing
then that could be a little bit of an
issue might be quite challenging to iron
these ruffles as well but I do love the
prints and I can imagine getting out of
wear out of this so I'm quite torn so
let me know your opinion on this little
number next up this one looks very
strange when it off but I think when it
on you guys will definitely see why I
picked it up this is a disputable
material this patent which i think is
known as like a porcelain Prince I find
it very Italian style this really looks
so strange basically as a body suit so
it's got this little really funny like
snicker area down the bottom which pops
does open and close so the top will
basically always stay tucked in it's
like me you love to have things tucked
into maybe high-waisted wide trousers it
could look really lovely very
lightweight material and then it's got
these crossover straps at the back I
definitely just need to try this on
because to be honest it looks really
weird like this but yeah high hopes for
this because it could be a really
beautiful centerpiece I am in love with
the flowers I think this is my favorite
thing from the entire haul video as you
can see these coops I'm wearing it with
are a little bit see-through but if you
wear nude underwear they're actually
fine these are the new look one
that I featured in my affordable haul
which if I can do two cards I will leave
that links above here as well but I'll
leave it also in the description box I
feel that you guys will love that whole
video I only did it last week so
everything's still super relevant as you
can see you thanks tomorrow Beauty trip
I have put on a little bit of weight
these are a little bit tighter than last
time you saw them on me but back to the
top I just think it's a stunning I'm
going to wear this so much this summer I
love how much skin is on show here I
think it's really elegant I love that
it's got the little I don't know what
you call it Clippy mini area oh my god
probably what I said that you know what
I mean but yeah beautiful material love
this pattern looks so much more
expensive than it was the back obviously
I need to choose a different bra but
it's got beautiful strap details I
really like how they fall really lovely
in light weights
yeah I do not have enough positive
adjectives to describe this top and so
so pleased with this and yeah I'll
definitely be wearing this with like
white jeans or the white skirts big big
big fan of this so you're going to be
seeing a lot of this on my Instagram etc
alright this next piece is a heck of a
lot of fabric for something which should
be very lightweight for some holidays it
also looks ginormous everything that I
ordered from misguided I tend to get the
smaller side this is in UK for and yet
this looks huge but then again when it
comes to beach cover-ups like this I
guess a little extra fabric isn't too
bad
hopefully a game once its ironed this
will look really beautiful I thought
that the rainbow kind of woven detail
here gave it a bit of a higher-end feel
you know those brands at a very very
Beach 5 style like faithful what's that
working with are Reformation those kind
of brands so hopefully this will give
off those kind of vibes but without the
price tag so let's give it a try alright
so this is a bit of a love-hate one I
really like the idea of this I just
don't know about the quality so let's
start with the positives I really like
the neckline I like that you've got so
much like free skin around the shoulders
I really like the shape of the sleeves
they're almost like flamenco style I
really like the fact that there's that
kind of floaty bottom I love
legs and I really like this rainbow
patch in the middle I think it gives a
really nice vibe I would say precise for
this is huge if you're tiny then this is
just going to be like a tent if you're a
size six or an eight or a ten I would
say still go for the size four
it just blows my mind that sizes could
be bigger than this like this is so much
fabric maybe it's more based on the
length that I'm yeah maybe that's it
and the other negative of course is it's
fairly cheap material so it's really
creased and because it's like this
pleated style material not sure the
official name of it I'm sure it's just
like a special machine pleated caution
or something but it makes it really hard
to iron so I guess I mean you can wear
it without ironing it and it just still
looks quite chilled out also a little
bit see-through I think if you had a
damp bikini on under this it would
definitely show through so that's
another thing to bear in mind but I
think it will keep it because I really
like Beach cover-ups like this and this
I feel is faint Instagram Abul so to go
tease this next piece looked absolutely
stunning on the model on the website so
hopefully unlike the art of rock similar
kind of vibes these are just a beautiful
pieces of summer wardrobe with a white
silky Council or those Topshop and River
Island ones that are just really playing
with the thin straps looks gorgeous with
things like this I find that certain
countries or even here in the UK you
just want to be a little bit more
covered up especially if you've got a
city break I wish I'd have this before
going to Madrid life is so perfect for
that but also if you're going anywhere
where you do need to have a little bit
more clothes on your body covering your
knees and your ankles for example it's
really handy to have a pair of
lightweight trousers if you live in
Dubai I would double you those kind of
places I know you need to be a little
bit more covered up so these will be
really handy for those kind of trips but
also just here in the UK really chic
summer work wardrobe beautiful
lightweight fabric and really nice
design it's almost that false imprint
and but more of a I always get that word
nowhere I can't imagine Daisy
and sabasha and so do these up I'm
presuming there's a zip yet as little
side zip so hopefully they'll be really
nicely fitted around the waist but once
again let's give them a try and find out
okay we have a lot of fabric going on in
these trousers they are super long and
despite the fact that I have got like
four inch heels on and I don't know
whether to showing these trousers or
just invest in some higher heels though
because I do really really love them
we've got a little puppy dog joining us
in the corner yeah I think I love the
fat dude these are so high-waisted my
crotch is like here so it's making my
legs look a lot longer really easy
breezy fabric just very lightweight
definitely a lovely once of flying and
all the occasions I mentioned earlier so
I paired this with a little white tank
top which i think is perfect way to
style this this one is a river island
one I have to say we are not impressed
because it's starting to pull
I really like the Topshop ones of these
which I also have a couple of I can go
in the wash so I'll leave them link down
below because I just find them one of
the most practical things in my summer
wardrobe so yeah that's enough about the
top trousers definitely going to keep
these because I just think that's super
practical and imagine getting a lot of
wear out of these and I do think they're
very flattering but ya need to just look
at a sign so I actually ordered those
trousers in two different sizes
I ordered the size four optimistically
but sometimes I can't get a size four in
my hips depends on how long does this is
but also bought size six I'll start with
a four and I'll let you know how they
fit just in case you are between sizes
like me so today okey this next one I
have very high hopes for I think this is
going to look really cute in
instagrammed images I know I'm super
shallow but this is a little place suit
so it's white lace you've got this
leather detail around the hemline and
around the waist and that kind of detail
or it reminds me of self-portrait in
Zimmerman style dresses but this one of
course is a fraction of the price you've
got a zip top closure at the back you
have got a little bit of lining so that
you won't be revealing yourself
underneath the lace but the majority of
it is a lightweight late material so be
nice and cool over bikini if you're
going for any parks or beach shows here
in the UK
really really nice cover-ups I think
this problem is really effective so
hopefully it looks as good on as it did
on model so let's give us right
absolutely loved this so so so happy
with this and wish our little pockets
but the shape of this is beautiful love
the lengths love this ladder detail
around the waist as you can see here
needs a little bit straightening out
which I think can be done with the iron
it's just the fabric has kind of folded
in strange places but there's a lot of
detail I think is beautiful
I think I'll definitely wear this in the
UK as well as like on upcoming vacations
I just think this detail is so so
beautiful lovely it's kind of monochrome
as well the ones of this I do buy quite
a lot of these enormous going to play
suits but ones I've had the past have
been mostly white but this I think is
just really really pretty
I actually think it looks nicer on
camera than it does in real life but it
does it very pretty in the flesh too but
yeah considering how affordable this is
got really nice like open back as well
this is really elegant and just a
beautiful little place suit so
definitely keeping this one okay this
just looks like a giant wash of pink
float of material but it is actually a
whole next dress although you'd have our
very small neck to fit into how they've
tied it up but yeah just literally looks
like loading material off so I'm going
to give this a try it is quite a lot of
material considering how slow shooters
so I don't know if it could be a little
bit warm for hot holidays or hot dates
in the UK but yeah let's give it a go
and hopefully we'll get a better picture
as to how it looks on I actually really
really like this piece obviously it
didn't look like anything when it was
off but now that I've got it on I'm a
big fan it's got this just beautiful
drape to the fabric I don't know how you
dine this maybe I need to like leave
this in the shower to steam out because
there are some creases going on really
nice kind of chilled out neckline it
makes it a lot more casual the fact that
it just holds a neck obviously you
wouldn't want to wear a bra with this
probably color wise it's absolutely
beautiful
I think that this could pass as
something a lot more expensive than what
it actually is yeah
pretty impressed with this I think
people would be amazed if you told him
it was misguided and if you told them
the price I think this was around 30
pound mark but a really lovely statement
piece I would say that it is quite warm
because of the lining because of the
amount of fabric but in the evenings
when you go on holiday or here in the UK
it does cool down a little bit so you
won't be too boasting in this but yeah
beautiful beautiful design definitely
want to wear heels with though because
it is pretty long don't you go key so
the next thing I picked up is this
bikini and if you've been following my
channel / Instagram for little while you
may recognize this kind of style I do
not know which way up you go
there we go because this is a kind of
deep for my Marysia bikini which is a
much more substantial fabric but very
similar design in that it's got this
scalloped edge train black high-waisted
bottoms and then a scalloped top as well
this material is much thinner this is
just like a plain neoprene elastane and
polyamide material so that just means
it's very lightweight the Marysia one is
almost more of a woven material I mean
you can tell it's a lot and higher
qualities that this was a fashion
surprise I think I paid maximum 30-pound
to the top of the bottoms you can also
choose different sizes so if you need a
bigger size in the top and a smaller
size in the bottom it's really great how
you can mix and match whereas Marysia
you have to buy this all set but yeah I
really wanted to try AB use of that
because I love that bikini and I know a
lot of you guys love it as well but it
is stupidly expensive so hopefully this
will be a really nice affordable
alternative TBC as to whether I'm going
to try this on you guys um if not I will
insert an image here of beautiful
website model who probably look a lot
better in it than I would anyway this
next piece kind of reminds me of the
Shakira whenever wherever video I don't
intend to show in my age but um look if
you also remember that video because she
wore a coin kind of pirate style
dressed in that video so yeah this is me
rocking my Shakira vibes it is an
off-the-shoulder little beach dress not
a place that this is a dress with this
little coin detail which i thought was
really good fun a very inexpensive thing
to throw on over your swimming costume
and just look nice and chic on a beach
so I kind of conviction what this looks
like on I'm going to give it a try
anyway so this is pretty much exactly as
I expected it to be oh my goodness I've
just noticed that this is
even it's higher here than it is here as
a major design flaw
come on misguided sort this stuff out or
is it meant to be like that don't I
maybe it's meant to be like that because
that's such a basic thing to get wrong
it does jingle a lot and you can bro
over here so if that kind of thing
annoys you then this is not one for you
this is also going to be one you're
going to have to iron every time you
wear it because even just from being in
my wardrobe
it's got creased so that's another
negative I do like the length I do
really like the style I love the coins
Shakira Shakira oh my god I need to get
life but yeah this neckline to me just
looks like it's been so drawn I really
like this and add a detail though and I
really like the point I don't know can
we oversee the bad points because it's
so cute let me know what you guys think
and then this piece is the piece that
actually made me make the order so I
don't know about you but whenever I'm
shopping I always add things to my
basket just kind of dreaming about them
but then it takes one piece that I
absolutely love that makes me make the
final purchase I don't have further
known or if any of you guys do that as
well let me know but this is the piece
that made me make my mind up and beside
that I've definitely needed all of these
things because this of course is very
reminiscent of dmoz only fabric which is
extortionate expensive beachwear but
this was I think it was about 26 pounds
I'll leave links where you can check all
the prices down below as I mentioned
earlier but this is a resource drop but
this is a very chilled out style
off-the-shoulder you've got these
three-quarter length sleeves cut in at
the waist and then these little shorts I
think it's going to be a beautiful piece
for upcoming beach holidays and also for
here in the UK again and you see side
trips and trip to the park anywhere that
you just want to rock those beachy kind
of festival vibes really looking forward
to trying this on I think a little
naughty with a can so let's give this
right I am so torn with this I really
don't know if I can make my mind up
about it I love the fabric this is just
so on-trend Mazzoni style I mean it's
the kind of fabric that's just always in
turn because it's designer connotations
but there's something just kind of wrong
about this design I mean maybe I need to
go size up but it's very much like
pulling up at the crotch area because of
you want to have a little bit of
overhang here like you would need to
wear it so that there's that much
overhang and it's not like giving you a
camel through the whole time the elastic
is a bit giveaway that it's affordable
and then the sleeves I feel like they
should be short because this is quite a
warm material and yet you have to kind
of roll the sleeves up which I don't
know if I love such a shame I feel like
I feel like I probably will keep this I
love the material I may order and size
up so I don't have this weird area going
on but misguided stick with this
material create a few different designs
maybe like a kimono or something or a
little day dress but ditch the elastic I
just love everything about this apart
from the elastic parts which sadly is
most of it damn okay this next one I
have got very high hopes for because it
is major self-portrait vibes but again
without that crazy price tag it's a
really effective white lacy dress with a
beautiful floral kind of embroidery all
over it and then a nude colours and
layer comparison I thought like I like
that so this is this one I feel like
will be really good for upcoming summer
events whether you've got I've got
Wimbledon or just any summer parties any
kind of birthday occasions I think this
could be a really lovely one I can't
even think about wearing it right now
there's so much fabric on this it's
probably going to be absolute sweltering
to try it on but the length is really
elegant as well it's got this leather
detail that I've mentioned earlier so
yeah now checking to the team I'm going
to try it on but this may not be pretty
this is so so so lovely I absolutely
love the shape of this my only slight
complaint is that there is quite a lot
of fabric around the hips I'm quite a
hippie person anyway so it just adds to
that but I think the high neck is just
beautiful I love the detail sleeves I
love the length I love the fact that
it's sheer at the bottom and then you've
got the floral detail down and the
bottom there as well I think this is
absolutely stunning if you love
self-portrait vibes but you don't have
that price tag same with me then yeah
this is absolutely stunning
I really like the color of the nude and
nice as well I think misguided have done
really really well with this piece
definitely keeping this and I've got a
polo event and a couple of evenings so I
think I will work to that so keep an eye
on my Instagram stories to see how I
style this and then the last fashion
piece from this order is the exact same
dress but in red because I know I do who
are a lot of news and whites and Pink's
but I thought I would try something a
little bit more bold obviously I'm not
going to keep both and let's be honest I
probably will end up keeping the white
one and I thought I would try the red
just to see how it looked so let's give
this one a go and again you know in the
comments which one you think I should
keep hmm I cannot decide whether I love
this or whether I'm not keen on it oh I
don't know I really liked the fact that
it's different color I really know that
it's bold I feel like I want to wear
this to like the salsa from monkey loss
or something but I do have a bit of an
issue with the lining don't know why but
I feel like with the white a little bit
more subtle but with this I feel a
little bit like an ice skater or
something along those lines like someone
from Dancing on Ice because I don't know
there's something about this neckline it
just feels like I'm wearing some kind of
dance costume I would say the fit is
beautiful once again the same as white
when the length is really elegant and
it's definitely nicer to buy something
affordable when it's this standout
because you're probably only going to
wear this like four or five times
different occasions so nice it's
affordable as opposed to self-portrait
I don't know instead if it's me let me
know what you guys think and then last
but not least I ordered this beach bag I
really love slogan pieces are really off
straw bags and this sounds totally over
the top but I do usually treat mine so
John you beach bag every time I go away
which I know is totally ridiculous near
the top
this one says chase the Sun although
it's not as clear as it was on the
website I can get free sheep the fact
that it's just kind of nude and black
and then you've got these really long
black faux leather straps a zippe
compartment keep all your bits and bobs
safe and it's just really really huge so
if you're going on a boat trip or a day
trip I'm sitting tanana it's a man
consume any good stick you could stick
everywhere towels in there it's so
but yeah green eyes big practical beach
bag and yeah I think it's a very cute
it's a very statement in the crema ball
style but we are not finished yet
because I also ordered a few misguided
pieces from a source a couple of weeks
ago and I forgot to show them to you so
I'm going to quickly whisper those as
well I'll leave links to them on both
websites because I don't know if miss
Kylie got staring right now when I got
all of this stuff it's trying to turn
off I'll leave them linked on a soft and
misguided so this is another dress which
I felt had self portrait vibes it's got
a leather detail again and then it's
beautiful floral embroidery which goes
over the sleeves a little bit it's also
got this lace kind of to Jewish style
around the waist and a really lovely
elegant length and aligning as well so
it should be really beautiful on I guess
I'm supposed to give this one I try I
cannot make my mind up about this dress
I can't decide if it's flattering or not
I can't decide if it looks good or not I
think it makes me look quite hippy hips
hip wise not peace and love I really
like this detail I really like the
floral detail but this sounds strange
but it's elastic in places where I don't
want it to be elastic like the sleeves
are so stretchy like that's really
strange and I feel like I want to have a
little bit more substantial nest to the
hood it holds it in place and this isn't
always life straight because a bit of
movement sisters add quite a lot of
volume to the hip area but the overall
effect I really like I love that it
stops being stopped having the
underlining around here you can see a
little bit more leg on the leg area it's
a little bit restrictive it's not the
easiest to walk in it is quite nice
shape around the boot ate a nice open
nice open back area
yes I'm undecided also sharing a little
bit of the bras yeah seems that in a
little bit too much fabric on the waist
on the bodice area but yeah let me know
what you guys think because I'm 5050
with this one is another piece in that
kind of porcelain style and it's a just
obtain a beachy shirt
although I think it's a bit really nice
almost
on open or just really loose over pair
of white jeans here in the UK really
lovely lightweight material and it's
very breezy easy to wear for how coming
holidays them but that got pockets as
well which I really really like and the
only thing I did try this on actually
before cuz I've had it lying around for
a little while the only thing I don't
have about it is the collar I feel like
the collar is a little bit too obviously
it's a little bit too formal considering
how relaxed the rest of the shirt is but
I'm going to try and let me know your
opinions whether the color is too formal
and yes not sure let's keep them or not
so let me hang a thought okay so here is
the beach shirts over tea means a bit of
an iron um I think it beats shirts or
even like rowing this is a pajama shirt
I think that if that's your thing and
this is a really lovely pattern it's
kind of like boyfriend style because of
this collar a nice length as well I've
going on over my little short still but
you could definitely wear this as like a
dress the pattern I really really like
the pattern the one thing that puts me
off about this is the color I just don't
really know what to do with it like do
you leave it open
do you have it up like something out
grease lightning but I look like such a
hot mess with my hair up is roasting in
here yeah not sure about this one also
this pocket is a little bit saggy I
don't know I don't know let me know your
opinion on this one guys because I need
your help
I don't know what to do and finally this
is the last piece this is kind of a
isequal peasant style blouse not sure
it's but it's really cool embroidery on
the back and then the shirt material
which is still in trend this season and
then you've got to tie at the front this
I probably say is best to be worn over a
bikini or maybe over a really cute like
lace bra or something so it's quite
revealing
you could almost wear this as an evening
just something to keep it show off your
shoulders or you could possibly even add
a couple of buttons to make it into a
proper blouse but it is a little bit
revealing when worn on its own
all around so that you're going to take
some holiday and got a nice tone tummy
and it might be quite nice to show that
off with this I'll show you what I mean
I'll probably pair this with a nice
pair of white jeans some heels for a
daytime look but could look really nice
and person and shorts for a daytime look
as well so that's about right
okay I'd say this is definitely one to
wear over a swimming costume rather than
over your bra because you can definitely
see my brother too much information
yeah I'm not too sure about this piece
quite a lot of stick materials so I'm
just not sure if I'd wear on summer
holidays because it is so sick
the sleeves are really long as well like
I don't have abnormally short arms but
these sleeves are super long I mean I'm
not going to lie I'm definitely gonna
send this back I can't really see myself
wearing this as much and it's making me
really hot so I can see how this would
look really nice maybe if it was a
slightly cooler evening with white jeans
but for me for what I want I'm not a
hundred percent sure about this so this
is going to go bad everything I picked
up from misguided recently I really hope
