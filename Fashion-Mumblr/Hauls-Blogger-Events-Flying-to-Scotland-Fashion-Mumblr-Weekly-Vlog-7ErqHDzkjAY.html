fourth weekly vlog of 2016 I hope you
guys are enjoying them so far
I'm afraid this one is going to be a
little bit less exotic than last week's
weekly vlog which was of course in Costa
Rica so I hope you guys have watched
that vlog because it's so much fun and
if you haven't watched it all the way to
the end and make sure you do because we
do something really really fun in the
last like minutes of the vlog I think I
did film a few clips of my brunch which
I had a meeting for breakfast I had
french toast at burners Tavern which is
one of my favorite places in London's
have breakfast I had a really nice catch
up with girls from clinique which was
really nice and yeah I had french toast
because I don't have to worry about
bikini body anymore so that was nice and
then I had a meeting in Liberty which
was really good and then I went to the
hotel cafe royal with benefit and I
think I filmed a little bit there so you
guys probably saw it a second ago
and that was to launch their boldest
beautiful campaign for 2016 if you go to
benefit and count us anywhere in the UK
during the month of May you'll pay the
normal price but all of the profits will
go to the charities and you'll also get
freaky me Brown next stairs chain
showing coat hangers naughty boy so that
gives a little terror no little naughty
boy um and you can also join in on the
March which was so much fun and did it
last year with my mum just get a group
of girls together it's going to be on
the 8th of May but I will tell you guys
all about it a little bit closer to the
time so yeah that's what I did this
morning which was really really nice
nice to catch up with the girls I'm home
now I've just wasted like 20 minutes
following people on snapchat I'm looking
at snapchat stories so now I need to be
productive I did a little bit of
shopping Oh while I was in town so I'm
going to show you that in a little bit I
also bought these sunglasses from their
brand called ki Australia that I got
them from
everybody liked them didn't need anymore
sunglasses funny and I saw them and I
was like every cute boy yeah I have my
leg on the bed like a pirate or
something look at Dexter so firstly Miss
Selfridge I went in next I had a few
minutes to kill between meetings and the
first thing that caught my eye was this
lovely grey jumper I have far too many
jumpers already but I just thought this
is a really nice one and a good prices
39 pounds and I really like this kind of
V detail down at the bottom there and
going to Scotland this weekend in need
of some warmth so I thought that was a
really nice one I'll try that on in a
second and then I also picked up a pair
of clots because I was on I think it was
the river island website the other day
and I saw I actually purchased a top and
I thought it would look really nice with
some qalaat so I've got a nice nude pair
these were 39 pounds as well and then
this is a lovely jumped suit in a nice
nude color the bow around the middle and
this white section in the middle and I
actually bought this with the intention
of wearing it to an event that I've
gotten Thursday which hopefully I'll
vlog so you might see it later on in
this vlog I'm going to try that on now
and oh hello you stop climbing on my new
clothes because I'm going to try this on
pughnell maybe wear it with my Valentino
shoes if it looks good and then another
pair of clots from Dorothy Perkins I got
these not dr. Perkins Miss Selfridge got
these with the intention maybe of
wearing during Fashion Week I thought
they're quite a cool style really like
clocks at the moment so they look quite
long there might be like trials of
length on me but we'll give it a go and
then the last thing from Miss Selfridge
seems to have got lost under everything
I Hugo well is this nice necklace so if
I put it down you can see it but better
so it's just got this little disc a gold
disc oops all tangled up and then a
hanging pearl and I thought that would
look quite nice on more plainer things
like with plain t-shirts
so the first thing is another piece of
knitwear and I've do fineries expensive
but I think their knitwear is just
really really good quality so this is a
nice very classic cream knit really
traditional really like this it's got
kind of a pretty nice texture almost
like a ribbed effect here and then
contrasting ribs almost like a dotty
effect there and a really nice big cozy
polo roll neck so that one I'm sure will
be coming to Scotland with me another
nice cozy one and then this is a much
lighter knit this is a light pink one I
believe this is long-sleeved as well so
these are the two bags initially I think
I like this one the best although a
couple of things
this is hanging quite strangely so it's
got these two dangly bits a little bit
in Michael Kors ask and it also has
little mark on it kind of like
toothpaste or something which is a
little bit strange but I do like the
style of this and maybe I'll take it in
and see if they can exchange it two
good-sized pockets on the inside and
then you've got this shoulder strap and
yeah I just really like the color of the
leather I like how it's got the magnetic
hello again got the magnetic flap this
one 195 so I'm just not sure if it's
worth it don't know let me know what you
guys think of that pretty pricey for a
handbag and then this one is quite cute
but again how much that's her little
look 165 just really not sure if I can
justify it this kind of color as well
it's quite classic but I will probably
get some makeup on it so you've got like
a secret pocket on the inside that I
would just do a card and then this big
zippy pocket in the middle with the dust
bag and then this gold chain strap which
you can double up where's one on one
just not sure on the value for money for
these two but let me try on the jumpers
and the clothes anyway see what we think
is there some kissing going on here he's
a gangster dog
so quite a plain pink jumper it's a
really lovely super lovely soft material
one be surprised if this was wool let's
have a little look yeah so this is 100%
wool which I'm not surprised at because
it is so lovely and line so definitely
think this is one I'm gonna be wearing
in Scotland and here second one it's not
quite so flattering just because the
neck is quite high on this one not sure
it does too much for my figure what do
you guys think let me know in the
comments whether you think I should keep
this one I mean is lovely and cozy and I
do reach for mutual colored knits quite
a lot so I'm sure I'd get quite a lot of
use out of it but you know race it's
probably not going to be the cheapest
of knits here we have the Miss Selfridge
net I mean obviously the quality isn't
as lovely and soft as the Rhys one but I
think for the price I really like the
shape of this one I actually think it
hangs better than the Rhys one
it's got like a lower section at the
back there really like this chevron
detail and I think price-wise this is 39
pounds compared to the Rhys ones which
I'm sure are over 100 pounds so I think
this one is definitely going to be a
keeper here's the first pair of trousers
obviously I wouldn't wear them with a
rolled-up thermal top but that's what I
had on underneath I really really like
this pair I think with like a silk
t-shirt tucked in and some nice heels
come on my tiptoes at the moment I think
needs to look really lovely I'm always
on the lookout for some kind of
different trousers because I wear jeans
obviously a lot and skirts
I think the high-waisted nests of these
they are the perfect size for my waist
thickness is really really lovely I'm
going to try these maybe even to wear
tomorrow that might be a little bit cold
because meeting the photographer Jay but
yeah I really like those I think they're
quite flattering this second pair I'm
not quite so sure if they're so
flattering they're very like everything
is visible around here you can really
clearly see
my waist you can see what I've eaten for
lunch pretty much and you can see my
nikkor line so bit of a shame because I
did really like the color of these but
they are not working for me I picked up
both clots in a size 4 it was actually
smaller than my usual side size and the
scene is really obvious here yeah shame
but I'm not loving this pair quite so
much and then finally we have the
jumpsuit I think I quite like it
obviously I've got the wrong bra wrong
so I'm wearing one of these lacy ones
doesn't have any support whatsoever I
haven't managed to do it up completely
at the back but it has Charlie's
approval which is always a good thing I
like the bow around the waist and really
like this neck detail I'll have to find
a really really pretty necklace to wear
with it so now I'm going to pack up some
things in my suitcase you ready for
Scotland I've got those two jumps in
there already and I'm gonna make like
this little man and go to sleep
after that it's getting a bit late now
so I think I'm going to say goodbye now
and see you tomorrow for another day of
meetings and some more fun events good
morning it is Wednesday actually
technically afternoon now I've had a
really really productive morning by
quarter past 7:00 I'd already edited a
video and published today's blog posts
so good day so far but then it starts to
go a bit downhill because my computer
kept crashing so we have tried to be
productive this morning but technology
has been my downfall a little bit and
yesterday my memory card kept crashing
on this so I fought a spare memory card
with me today just in case I'm about to
go out now I'm about to meet Jerry from
Olympus for lunch we're gonna go to
Charlotte Street Hotel grab some lunch
and then maybe do an outfit shoot or two
I'm gonna run to Carolyn and pick up a
top from there which I like to shoot
before Valentine's Day feeling really
pretty and pink today I painted my nails
pink last night got quite a girly makeup
and I'm wearing this new restock which I
showed you yesterday I picked up in
my little haul so I'm going to show you
the rest of the outfit so the top half
is pretty nice
this pink jumper the Dorothy Perkins
necklaces I'm not going to focus which I
also showed you yesterday and then my
Zara leather leggings but then I am
wearing my trainers and I never do this
this is the first time I've ever gone
out the house wearing the comfy shoes
and bringing my other shoes with me so I
want to shoot these ones but show it's
three hotel where I'm going for lunch is
quite a little walk from Oxford Circus
station and I've got to go caramel in
first so I'm wearing my comfy shoes just
so I can get there real quick and then
I'm going to change into other ones
afterwards so running a little bit late

dinner didn't returning he's reclining
he's wearing my old glasses which I used
to wear before I had laser eye surgery
and now they are perfect for him and his
shortsightedness when watching the TV
which is miles away and now we are just
chillin and I've got to say goodbye to
my little beasty because Hannah and I
are going to Scotland on Friday with
Chas and Hannah's boyfriend Chris and a
couple of Hannah's friends so mother who
is here is going to take away my feet
just make goodbye to my pushing me good
morning Hannah stayed over last night so
we are both tottering along
we've got new meetings and a few press
days so Sunday
leaving the river first day and as a
cheese truck outside the sustenance that
would be provided with and I've got a
chihuahua by Kate search awawa which
apparently is a region in the south of
Mexico and chorizo grilled cheese
sandwich so so far I think my calorie
count for the day is 3 about 12,000 and
I'm okay so I'm in a bit of a food coma
following that grilled cheese somewhere
do you feel and say hi so cute well you
know expecting that see you out my
peripherals then you despair yeah so I
feel like Hannah's face just then and I
don't even remember if I've logged at
the next frost date because
my brain has turned into cheese but
Hannah and I are now on our way to the
Ivy Brasserie where we're gonna have an
afternoon tea Sage's keeps on getting
healthier and healthier and it should be

scones and jam and cream cheese and all
