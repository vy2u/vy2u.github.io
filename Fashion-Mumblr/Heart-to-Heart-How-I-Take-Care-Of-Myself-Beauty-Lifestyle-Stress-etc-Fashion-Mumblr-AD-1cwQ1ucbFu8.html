for joining me for today's video as you
may be able to guess it is the evening
I'm wearing my country's I've got my cup
of coffee so today's video is going to
be a really lovely relaxed and chatty
one I was kind of debating whether to
call this a fireside chat
I thought fire going on down there
beside me um or I don't know there's
like a heart to heart because I want to
do this type of video a little bit more
regularly where we just have a nice
little chat together so that sort of
space video is going to be and the topic
for today's chat is going to be all
about self-care how I take care of
myself and I feel that it's a really
good time to be having this type of
discussion because I mean in the
blogosphere obviously Fashion Week has
just happened so everyone is up their
neck in work and we're all a little bit
stressed a little bit busy and I think
they're taking the time out for
self-care is really really important
equally I know in school and university
it is coming up to exam period so
hopefully my cat will be useful for a
lot of you guys watching so I'm going to
get straight stuck in that with one of
the first things I like to do is take
care of myself and I like to call this a
mindful reboot so it's something that I
like to do not every day but when I'm
feeling a little bit anxious and a
little bit stressed and you can find
anything that really relaxes you and
chills you out do your mindful reboot
but for me I have as you may know from a
few of my videos been really getting
into meditation this year I do want to
do a little bit more yoga as well but at
the moment I'm finding church is doing a
little bit of meditation 3 or 4 times a
week is really really helping me out so
meditation is something that I used to
think was a little bit airy-fairy I
don't really get the point of it but now
that I've tried it I'm a full-on
believer so I found that meditation for
me is a really good way of reducing
stress it keeps me mindful that helps to
almost clear my mind if you wake up and
you've got millions of thoughts going
around in your head then meditation can
just slow the pace
mind and I find that by clearing out the
clutter going round and round in my head
it leaves me with a clearer brain and I
can be a lot more productive in the day
so that's the first thing but also it
has been so many studies into meditation
and despite them still not everybody
does it not everyone that complains of
stress but it has been proven to reduce
stress depression anxiety and even
physical pain so while I don't suffer
hugely from any of those I do suffer
from stress and so for me that's been
the main reason why I do meditation
maybe three or four times a week the
reason why I think the meditation is
great in a mindful respect is that it
allows you to almost take a step back
and if you've got a clear mind it helps
you to react better to any situations
that you'll put in so for example if I
get an email through or I see a comment
that makes me older and real stressed I
can just take a step back and take a few
deep breaths and even that even that
short amount is meditation to me and
just doing that really helps to clear
the mind and help you analyze the
situation and see how to respond in the
best possible way of course for me
meditation is still fairly new so it's
not fully a part of my daily routine yet
I was dead doing a few times a week but
I'm hoping that when we go on our trip
on unity osteo every single morning
India and Maldives are both amazing
places where hopefully I'll be able to
wake up sunrise meditation - sounds like
a dream so let me know if you'd like to
maybe see a video on how I meditate it's
like a really was young approaches to
how I meditate maybe meditation for
beginners that kind of thing
throwing my phone's going off in the
background I'm coming up to my next step
but yeah let me know if you'd like to
see how I do it how I fit it into my
schedule is let me know in the comments
if that's kind of thing you'd like to
see from me my next self-care tips may
sound a little bit hypocritical a little
bit ironic given what by beautiful work
which is obviously blogging
YouTube instagramming basically
everything that involves me being glued
to my phone at all times but my next tip
for self-care is a digital detox and I
know my mum and I love you
that name you might be rolling their
eyes right now but actually I have been
finding that by giving myself an
hour-long digital detox on most mornings
and every morning just my wake up not
checking my phone straightaway if you
watch my mindful morning routine you'll
know that I don't like checking my phone
straight away because that just starts
the brain chats that are going off for
things you wake up since you filmed you
with sorts of comparison if you're
checking people's Instagram seeing their
perfectly edited life and comparing it
to your own when you've probably got
pizzas on you from the night before
so yeah it's probably not the best idea
to start with work emails and Instagram
and that kind of thing I personally
don't like starting my day that way so
digital detox can be anything from a day
I mean if you're going away from where
or if you're really strong then you can
maybe do a day that's even just an hour
or half an hour in the morning just if
you get yourself ready you don't need
that distraction going on in the
background so there's been so many
people looking into the damaging effect
of having Wi-Fi on around you like your
phone just signals from your phone and
going off all night as rebars I start to
put my phone on airplane mode but I mean
this is kind of like daily mail stuff
but it's been me to brain cancer and
radiation all this sadness but don't
know too much toilet to do it quote me
but I mean there's going be something
not terribly good about having radiation
waves from the Wi-Fi ultimate signal of
your phone going off constantly so I
think a digital detox is really really
important as I said I like to switch my
phone on airplane mode not only does it
mean that Charlie and I sleeps better
during the night because there's no
buzzing or vibrations going off through
the night but also if you can keep your
bedroom and an entirely electronic free
zone and that's going to be even better
if you try not to look at any blue
lights so that's any kind of screen I
think around an hour before bedtime and
hopefully you should find yourself using
a lot better which in turn hopefully
will lead to let's go that's anxiety and
generally just getting out better about
yourselves so that's another small thing
that I like to do the third thing that I
like to do to take care of myself is
walking that summer
natural alternative so that can be in my
diet
charleen I've been trying to go down the
farmers market at weekends get some more
organic food we're basically trying to
cut out as many toxins from my diet as
possible so where does that mean buying
organically or just trying to make food
from scratch a lot more that's become
something that we've been a lot more
aware of in 2017 if you've been watching
like my wife in a day videos or even
just my Instagram stories you'll see
that we do like to prepare a lot of our
food from scratch and then secondly when
it comes to natural you've probably seen
on my blog a few more post about natural
and organic products now as a beauty
blogger it's really hard for me to only
use natural and organic but I am a very
conscious of the amount of chemicals
been putting on my skin so where
possible and especially body lotion when
you think about how big an expanse the
body is and how much skin is on your
body if you're putting a body lotion on
that sort of chemicals it's probably not
the best thing to do so I've been trying
to switching a lot more natural beauty
products into my routine and a few of my
favorite brands include Jason skincare
dead body lotion smells so good and also
their body wash and the hand cream
actually I've also been using Beauty
kitchen facial oils are absolutely
gorgeous and whenever I love so many of
the things that scrubs body lotions and
lotions there really are so many amazing
natural beauty brands at the moment and
as I said I have been writing about them
a little bit more on my blog recently
but that another way I like to take care
of myself is trying to minimize the
toxins going onto my skin in any way
possible another area where I've been
looking into more natural alternatives
and bare with me with this one it's
birth control so I knew that isn't
something that I normally talk about on
the blog but when I heard about natural
cycles and I started to do a little bit
of research concerned I thought it was a
fantastic idea an alternative to current
birth control method and I really want
to let you guys know about it so natural
cycles is an app and it is a natural
form of birth control the app has been
officially approved as a method of
reception and there have been lots of
medical studies which have proven it
almost as effective as hormone
treatments like the pills the implants
etc I'm sure you guys have heard about
standard fertility and like period
tracking apps in the past but this one
is really different in that it is
officially proved to be a method of
birth control so sorry visiting boys
listening or watching but it checks your
cycle so you know when you're at your
most fertile and also when you're at
your news cycle which helps you to
either plan or prevent pregnancy
depending on what you want to do so how
it works
and what makes it so reliable is that
natural cycles it isn't out but you can
also get a thermometer and it checks
your temperature you take your
temperature every single morning input
it into the app and your temperature is
also a measure of your level of hormone
the algorithm that they created once you
input your temperature into the app has
been proven so effective that natural
cycles is actually the world's first app
that is an officially proven method of
contraception so that is pretty
impressive am i right so once again
something I never thought I'd be showing
on the Internet
but personally when it comes to birth
control the pill is not for me I tried
it when I was in uni and it just turned
me into a moody cows so for a long time
I've been looking for a more natural
alternative and with natural cycles you
literally are just taking the
temperature putting it into the app and
trying out whether you're fertile or not
so really not messing with your body at
all
so apparently women and refer tiles for
6 days in their cycle and when I was
researching it because to honest it did
sound a little bit too good to be true I
found out that in tests of a thousand
women only five got pregnant with the
apps use the algorithms forty actually
using a green day whereas three in a
thousand got pregnant with the pill and
so yes very very comparable obviously
still not 100% foolproof and doesn't
protect against fbi's but a whole lot
more natural and putting hormones in
your body so yeah this whole natural
cycles
really does blow my mind I hope you guys
can understand why I wanted to talk to
you about it when they approached me I
think that this is going to be able to
game changer and natural birth control
method and I know that so many of us are
unhappy with our current birth control
options and I want to be handling heart
thing this is such an incredible
innovation and definitely something that
I'm going to be and already am relying
on not only does it always birth control
but also irregular cycles as well and
you can literally track everything so
I'm going to leave all the information
about the app down below in the
description box you can also like read
about it on Silas
the independent a telegraph part of me
that loves it there are a lot of people
writing about at the moment so I'll
leave some literature as well as more
information please check out so yeah
that really is a game changer and to me
so nice you can take control of this
path your life without having to mess
with you home homes and just such a
lovely natural alternative so as well as
natural food and natural beauty products
now this aspect of my lifestyle is
natural as well so yeah really hope you
guys found that interesting and please
do read about it so I think for us girls
it's important we do talk about this
stuff
and I really wanted to share with you
and the final topic for my self-care
self-love heart-to-heart video is
another way that I helped to reduce
stress and that is a few tips on getting
a good night's sleep so for me I feel
that I'm a whole lot less stressed a
whole lot less anxious and just
generally in a much better mood when I
get a good night's sleep obviously the
things I've mentioned previously in the
few helped me to get a better night
sleep as well especially meditation I
find that that is also in my mind there
are a few podcast I listen to and a few
of them have a special seat meditation
parts on them so if you do struggle in
order then perhaps a sleep
guided meditation will be a good one to
use but other tips I knew these are
mainly kind of obvious but having a bath
is actually one of the best things you
can do without your phone maybe pick a
magazine in or a book or just light some
candles super cliche I know but it
really works
there are so many brands that have got
products that you can pop in the bath
aromatherapy associates in a favorite
Clarins of course Rey dots as well super
affordable they all have relaxing
scented bath products that will help you
drift off a lot more easily Charlie and
I also have a little this works and
fuser and we pop a few drops of lavender
or eucalyptus we're even using oldest
were the moments we don't want to get
any bugs and and that's really
beautifully since the room and helps you
to feel a lot more relaxed to get a
better night's sleep another thing that
I really like is luxurious pillow cases
so Charlie and I we've been definitely
from silk pillowcases and not only is
that bed of your skin and your hair but
also this is something really nice about
keeping on an abuse pillow case what we
like to do is spritz our pillows with
some sense in essential oils obviously
this works deep seat pillows really
absolutely love and then when you're
traveling as well that smell almost
actually reminder of home so it can help
you feel a little bit more ease and
please a lot more easily so pillowcases
and scenting them is another tip and
then of course also linking back to what
I said earlier in the video about a
digital detox this is so important if
you find it really hard to switch off at
night if you want to be people that is
tossing and turning until like 2 o'clock
in the morning then definitely try a
digital detox an hour before you go to
bed
not even just checking if your mom and
takes you back yeah just have a switch
off and just try these tips for a few
nights and see if it makes any
difference to you because we definitely
work for myself they work for Charlie
and a few other friends that have taken
of this advice as well so guys I really
really hope you enjoyed this video it
felt really nice to have another chat
with you guys sharing some thoughts on
some changes I've been making in my life
recently and definitely do check out
natural cycles I know it's totally out
of the blue me talking about birth
control with you but honestly when I
read about it when I started trying it I
just thought it was such a genuinely
good idea I mean with
or girls yeah mostly but why should it
why should it be a topic that we have to
talk about because I think it's really
really important and a great innovation
so yeah I really really hope you like
this video let me know if you have any
self care tips please do leave them in
the comments below and then we can all
share our pips I'd love to read them and
when else can read your tips as well so
definitely let's have a little chat in
the comments section down below
so guys all from me really really hope
you guys enjoyed today's video and I
will see you in my next one
