holiday beauty slash grooming essentials
video South Africa from the city Flickr
so Charlie is really freaking yes
Charlie is getting quite used to having
a camera thrust in his face well I've
been vlogging quite a lot recently so to
be efficient so I thought singers are in
such beautiful surroundings we're in the
Java fossils hotel in camp's bay we
thought we'd make most of it and film a
video so we thought we would pick out
five I may have got a few more
essentials that are kind of beauty slash
grooming slash pampering essentials for
taking on a holiday so I'm going to go
first because I've got to my first
holiday beauty essential is an
exfoliating shower scrub because you
don't want your tan to go flaky you
don't want to have any dry skin when
you're on holiday and I've chosen the
L'Occitane I can't pronounce this one
people want sublime yeah prove it one
little extract of one second the other
side no so this is a gentle two-in-one
exfoliating perfecting scrub and the
reason why choosing this one is because
it's really really gentle it's turns
into an oily kind of milky lather on the
skin so if you are a teeny tiny bit
sunburned and this one is still really
lovely and that's not good it smells
amazing it smells like peonies how why
do you like it is really girly well I
used in the channel it smells good cool
Charlie uses a lot of my beauty
essentials don't you darling
um yeah so it's really good for giving
yourself a bit of a pre Beachcomber okay
along the scrub lines
it's the origins I never thought I would
say that ginseng do you think it's
called a refreshing scrub cleanser it's
just it's basically just a really good
face scrub little bit summary quite
quite quite good for holiday yeah
just just a good face scrub I think it's
quite good after shaving as well get rid
of any sort of rash I actually had to
wet shave for the first time in like
years this holiday cause my razor ran
out of battery so yes it helped me with
that but yeah it's a nice boss
does smell amazing doesn't it yeah it's
not it's not microbeads oh is it right
refreshing scrub cleanser while origin
is mostly natural so it's coffee bean
yeah yes so it's good for the
environment
so my next two are both after shower
products and I'm doing two and one
because they're both kind of similar
neither of which are after sons because
we've both been really good with our SPF
recently and we haven't we been getting
burnt so no need for proper after Sun
but firstly I've chosen the heel gel
body calm nourishing basically the
yellow one from heel gel I've also got
the green one which is good for if you
do happen to get any burning bits but
thank the Lord I haven't had to use it
yet so this is really good for
replenishing the skin letting it kind of
get back to its normal healthy state if
you were doing yeah it's called the
advanced skin rescue apply to dry skin
and I finally the sinks in really really
quickly so I can then and go in with an
oil and I love oils because they give
the skin a lovely kind of subtle blitzen
and the reason why and the reason why
I've chosen the Avon Skin So Soft oil is
because firstly it's a dry oil so again
sinks in really quickly you don't have
any kind of grease on your hands just
the windows right there so we have a bit
of an audience right now but I couldn't
carry on anyway but the great thing
about this oil and I feel like none of
people know this is it it's actually
anti mosquito it's not official anywhere
but there's something about this that
the insects absolutely hate so if I
spritz this all over which I do most
evenings it stops any creepy crawlies
from fighting me so this is definitely
another holiday section okay one more
for me let's go in moisturizer so this
actually this is one that I use pretty
much all the time in the UK as well it's
current men I never I would say that
either it's a super moisture bomb and
it's from their men's collection makes
me feel like it is specifically for men
yeah I know but
it's a moisturizer but it's a really
good one obviously it's really good to
keep your skin especially a face
moisturized during a holiday to maximize
that tan trying to try to get his time
as possible but yeah it's just a really
good product nice size as well for your
for your toiletry bag yeah cool cool
yeah so Karen's men's super moisture
bomb my next one is just a teeny teeny
tiny one but this is such an essential
for my hair if anybody else gets those
kind of matted dreadlocks after they go
on the beach or you just find your hair
really hard to comb through then you'll
know that a leave-in conditioner is so
essential the beach holidays anything
darling yes just my serie going up in
the background by the way my middle
button stuck down but this one here is
the pure ology color fanatic
multitasking hair beautifier for
perfecting color treated hair and lots
of words on the small bottle it is an
amazing amazing product I find that I
just it's all over especially in the
kind of crown area yeah my hair is still
pretty wet right now and it just helps
me to detangle my hair I don't need to
put anything else on the ends let it air
dry and doesn't go frizzy so a really
really handy product I've actually
finished this this evening so I've had
to go and buy a local version which
won't be as good but I cannot do without
this stuff next for me I like L'Oreal's
many products I use a lot of them but
this one's really good it's a black
charcoal face wash I kind of use it
everyday so I'd probably use it as well
as using the scrub or certainly after my
exercise or after some bathing and
sweating and it's really good to clear
the paws yeah yeah yeah charcoal is a
big thing isn't it but it seems to work
it's a nice foam as well
I'm just don't get it in your eyes yeah
phone's arms like a black foam don't get
in your eyes cause it hurts a lot but
yeah it's a good product sounds good you
try that one my next one is a really
really obvious one for a holiday but for
this holiday we are in South Africa as I
mentioned and is there autumn season I
chose in the piss plain tan and protect
tan accelerating oil
this one is SPF 15 it also comes in SPF
30 but because it's not hot hot and the
Sun is not too intense right now but we
still obviously need protection I've
gone for this one so you've still got
that SPF uva UVB protection but because
it's an oil it helps to accentuate your
tan so he's still managed to get a
little bit of color although the
lighting right now is completely washing
us out although he's still it really
well
but yeah we've still managed to get a
little bit of color thanks to the fact
that this isn't oil so this is
definitely a smells good holidays I'm
sure when it smells amazing piss burn
smell just reminds me all of those
anymore yeah another product it's a new
one for me it's from this works which is
a brand I really like and I just say
whenever I get blogger mail a Charlie
always is rummaging through yeah yeah I
love the brand this works it sounds
really sad but it's their sleep spray
that's really good yeah they're honestly
throwing their pillow sleep spray I yeah
I'm gonna admit to it because none of my
mates watch this I use a lot of eye
cream I normally use Clarins or Clinique
i roller and they're quite good but this
one's pretty cool it's called light time
open eyes and it's got like a it's got
like a weird quite scary roller thing
but yeah it actually feels really nice
when you're applying you like this and
yeah I thinking that it comes out there
and you rub it on with the silver side
but it genuinely makes a difference
puffiness in the morning doesn't feel as
puffy and I get quite big big black dang
well I do sometimes anyway especially on
holiday when you're dehydrated that's
when you're gonna get black eye bags
sticking in your case a badger alright
my next one is on my next few are Beach
beauty related and firstly I've chosen a
tinted moisturizer with additional SPF
in it so I'll always use a facial SPF my
favorite is the piss boy factor 30 for
sensitive skin because it doesn't have
any
sometimes my skin goes a little bit red
in the Sun but the Pittsburgh wine just
is really nice and calming for my skin
but because I do want additional cover
I've also been using the library it's
really hard to read cellular Swiss ice
crystal transforming cream and this is
also SPF 30 with UVA protection now this
is of course SuperDuper expensive so you
don't have to use this one just any
tinted moisturizer with an SPF I also
really like get Long's terracotta which
is SPF 20 and I think bare minerals
complexion rescue has SPF as well but
don't quote me on that but this just
gives a really light coverage to stop
any redness and I just feel a little bit
more glamorous on the beach and also
very protective when I have a tinted
moisturizer on okay on to my favorite
product of all time
Palmer's cocoa butter I use it
religiously it's very good I also notice
I'm convinced that it's meant to be for
it that with all the scars and cuts I
get in rugby season
I'm pretty sure it makes quite a big
difference yeah just you know like the
average life stop mark or scratch or
sort of like small deep cuts obviously
don't put it directly on to do come but
yeah as Josie said earlier we don't
really use after Sun and this is just
really good to keep skin moisturized
legs and stuff like that they can get a
bit dry during during a beach session so
yeah Palmer's cocoa butter the standard
one they do do a men's one they also do
a tanning yeah Mays like I wouldn't
about that but they do men's one as well
it's exactly the same it's just branded
differently yeah
yeah so good product smells amazing and
I'm going to custom I last fall together
to whiz through them them and they're
all more Beach beauty essentials mostly
from the Clarins summer range which I
talked a lot about in my spring/summer
beauty launches video which I will link
down below and firstly the Clarins
fix makeup long-lasting makeup hold
hydrates refreshes soothe so this is a
spray which I spray on after I've done
my makeup and not only does it give my
skin a little bit more hydration which
is always really good on a holiday but
also stops my makeup from sliding down
my face so I use this in the daytime and
in the evening and it just sets my
makeup next is a tinted lip balm when
I'm on the beach I don't like to have a
lipstick on it's just too much this is
the benefit cha-cha tint gives a
lovely coral kind of Sheen to my lips
and also protecting its color look at a
coral on the eyes I have a waterproof
cream eyeshadow also from the Clarence
in our collection this is a really
lovely metallic kind of Goldy copper so
it just looks very almost Ivy third
evening just a metallic a little bit of
shine to it but not too obvious so it's
not like an evening metallic but you
could layer it up to be an evening one
and lastly the Clarins double fix
mascara and this is basically a top coat
for your favorite mascara which turns it
waterproof and it really really works
clones are just amazing when it comes to
making things waterproof so this has
become a new each essential nice and we
thought that to finish we would include
our favorite beach gadgets because China
uh kind of into our so I know that's how
I go first okay this is something that
we got actually about six months ago
so it's from Huy so ultimate is and it's
their ultimate is roll UE roll yeah now
what's quite cool is a it's waterproof
so you can actually just you can drop in
this from the pool office it will sink
but it comes with like no no this sinks
but slowly but it does actually have
like an inflatable like almost like lino
for a speaker but for the beach it's
really good obviously it's bluetooth and
it's rechargeable and it's got quite a
little battery and it can hang like that
in the shower as well so all in all it's
just pretty cool products yeah really
good quote sound design yes it's quite
nice it's a good speaker for in your
room for like if you're having dinner
with friends and then obviously at the
beach you don't need to worry about
breaking it yeah it's pretty cool it's
pretty cool I'm good quality so that's
my favourite Beach charger
mine is a very new addition to my beach
gadget collection and I'm so chuffed
that I picked this up we found this in a
shopping mall on the waterfront a couple
of days reindeer wasn't it
ha was on the radio is where you
obsessed with it what was it on a
magazine so is very have the Vodacom the
radio station then your answer ok em
Cape Town favorite radio station anyway
so this is a solar-powered battery pack
so any other bloggers out there or
anyone that's constantly on their mobile
phone
like me and like Charlie will know that
iPhone battery and a lot of other
smartphones is rubbish so this not only
charges your phone but charges itself
using solar power and it can also try to
a camera back you can charge you can
charge our from wind from the wall yeah
so then you could have it as a battery
pack from the wall and then if it starts
to run the beach you can charge it up
again yeah obviously it won't be very
useful in the UK any time you know well
that's poor it's like a hook not in
trauma sure but it's also got a torch
which is kinda cool yeah this is a nice
size it is a really good size it's no
heavier than my existing battery pack
which is great it's called my power
I'm sure yeah this was just quite cheap
because it's South African around but
this is gonna be super duper useful for
the rest of this trip for our days on
the beach and also when I do track
America because I'm not sure how often
we're gonna like get electricity so yes
really really pleased with this new
little addition and that is it those are
our beach essentials they're hidden her
versions and also our peach gutters
Texas oh wow Texas B if there's anyone

get some sunglasses for dogs please post
