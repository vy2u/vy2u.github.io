four days at amazing Jack Monday morning
and we're at Frank and Benny's in the
airport's boo boo that have a little
fryer so that we are all fed ready for
shopping so I just had a lovely hand
massage at the journal own answer in
world gt3 and then I was looking at the
five years and recognized these tiles
and I use the same when I was stranded
awhile ago sitting Joe Aleman available
of cheeky inspiration from my Instagram
so he spent so long and duty-free that
our names just got a cord and we just
got told off over the tannery and if we
do not get on the flight our bags will
be deported unloaded open-ended anyway
running the plane would go without hands
up if you know where that grows from
we just arrived at the residenz er board
sorry here in Verona I realized that my
accent then was really really poor and
have a look look around me this room is
absolutely beautiful it's very
traditional Italian lots of nice warm
colors the hotel has really cool
wallpaper everywhere we've got fish on
this wall behind me and in receptionist
for mingoes really cute it's really
lovely very very opulent and show you
the bathroom as walks it's kind of a
bloggers dream with marble everywhere
although very dark apart from obviously
when I switch the light on so yes this
is the bathroom
really beautiful yeah that's all about
so enough that so I think mom and I are
just going to do a tiny bit unpacking
going to freshen up my makeup
and now we're going to head out to the
town okay makeup touched up I've just
put on a little bit Oh Charlotte Tilbury
sexy sienna my favorite lipstick ever
and now I think we're going to go and
have a look around the town it's I don't
think it's very big Verona the only
thing I really know is that it's my
Romeo and Juliet was that so we are
obviously going to go and find the
Juliet balcony and I think there's some
lovely gardens and maybe some palaces
they'll Bruce go a little stroll and see
we can find when we were in the airport
mum and I stopped off Outworld duty-free
we had really nice and hand massage at
rovolon which I think I did blog yep I
did and I'm obviously picked up a couple
of Beauty bits as well so quickly show
you what I got and I saw on Fred in my
love who if you don't follow her she's
amazing I'll link her channel down below
I saw that she picked up a Mac eyebrow
pencil in gt3 and it looked like the
exact right one for me is why I think
they've got quite similar colorings and
so I picked up the mug fling eyebrow
crayon and I'm going to give this a try
later and then I also got a new Bobbi
Brown lip pencil if you guys aren't
following my beauty videos reason you'll
know time
really laughing using their mind
recently so got Bobby Brown lip pencil
in the shade Rose which is a very pretty
kind of dusky pink and then I also got
the Chanel lip age less beige healthy
glow share powder which looks a little
something like this
and I've wanted to try this for so long
it's kind of a foundation powder in one
so you can use it as a foundation or you
can use a top a foundation as a powder
so I'm going to give that a try tomorrow
my finger bit of a lighter base yeah
that's a bit so I picked up in duty-free
so we're just trying to get into the
Juliet balcony as predicted it is
towards the central so we're just trying
to like weave our way through the crowds
behind me there's this wall where
everybody writes their names if you come
with a boyfriend you write
yeah the puppy is ahead of us we are
I'm guessin we've just come to the
giardino giusti which is on the north of
the river really really beautiful garden
as you can see behind me and I got chain
cases absolutely roasting it's about 25
degrees I'd say and mum and I are
feeling a bit tired from getting up so
early so we had a little nap and now I
think we're going to try and take some
outfit photos because it's seriously
gorgeous
spent the afternoon at the jardin where
I was earlier and now we're just making
our way back suppose how it's getting
quite that's nice that now going off
we're feeling a little bit itchy because
we had a little nap on the grass and I
think there's some creepy crawlies so it
just didn't match the hotel now gonna
have a quick shower and get changed
ready for dinner
hey guys it is the evening now as you
can tell on the darkness and moment I
have to swim back to the hotel we had a
quick freshen up and brushed our hair
and now we are just looking for pizzeria
or something along those lines just have
a quick dinner and then we're going to
have an early night because we're really
really tired because we had a super
early morning this morning and we're off
again tomorrow morning to the hotel at
Lake Garda which are really excited
about
so yeah just cool Lipson to eat now and
then early night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
