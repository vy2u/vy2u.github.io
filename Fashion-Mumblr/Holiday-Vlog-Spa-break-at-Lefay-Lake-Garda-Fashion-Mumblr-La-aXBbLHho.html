blonde party last night we went out for
a pizza and that the food coma kind of
followed that and we had an early night
so it wasn't terribly exciting and then
this morning we left the residence lab
or sari and took an hour-and-a-half
Drive and we're now at Lake Garda the
beautiful lafay hotel and before I start
unpacking uh so I just quickly show you
the room because it's really really
beautiful this is the main part of the
room I've set my laptop up here and then
we've got a nice little TV station and
beds in here mum giggling I think she's
hiding somewhere and and then look at
this view the view is absolutely
stunning they've got patio doors that
lead out onto the garden and then the
view of the lake which is absolutely
gorgeous
it's completely silent out here apart
from me talking look at this I don't
think I've heard such silence and so
long and then back to the room are you
hiding behind the door all right and
then this is the bathroom
beautiful big again marble surfaces and
got lots of nice cosmetics here for us
to use huge bathtub and this is like a
shower room in there and then we've also
got a separate toilet room which is
quite cute under the Wardrobe area so
that is our room and a full-length
mirror here perfect for little selfies I
just dressed comfortable today because
we were traveling so I'm wearing my
Oasis flare trousers which you see me
wearing a few times
next sandals which I wear all the time
and then this lovely jumper with kind of
like a scalloped detail this is from
French Connection and then my Caravelle
watch which I got from the apartment at
London Fashion Week so now I think we're
just gonna go and explore thus far the
spire is
incredible and mum and I've got a few
massages and treatments booked in but
for now we're just going to go and chill
by the pool for a bit
you
I drop my camera there's nothing to blow
is God
when I go up to it
you
the skier
herbal tea
Oh
it's decided to come for a little
explore and I want to show you this
incredible view behind me have a look at
this isn't that amazing
so our hotel is them it's on top of hill
overlooking the lake it takes maybe
probably about an hour to get down to
the lake mom and I went down there this
afternoon it was kind of cloudy earlier
and now it's really lovely but I just
can't get in that view
so incredible and when right now I'm
just trying to find the Chinese garden
because it's hotels on a huge lot of
land go into the hills and appearances
Chinese garden somewhere all different
elements or the dragon the fire the wind
they were just trying to find that
hello darlings I thought I'd do a quick
update so mom and I have been in the spa
for the rest the afternoon I had a
lovely Meridian stretching or stretching
of the meridian which again was another
Chinese healing method I think you'd
call it and not really sure but it was
some really easy stretches but pani just
really helps to improve different areas
of your body like your energy levels or
your stress levels and he's given me a
booklet so I'm definitely going to try
continuing them at home where I'll let
you know if it works because all it does
sound too good to be true at the same
time the way that he like explained it
it sounds really amazing so I'll let you
know how I get along with that and then
and then I had a facial which was really
unusual it started off by the lady you
massaging my hands and my feet to relax
the facial muscles which is really
interesting and then just a full-on
facial massage so I came way just
feeling like my face muscles just kind
of you know just relaxed which is really
nice not loads of lotions and potions
like a normal facial then we were
relaxing by the pool the rain cleared
away so we could see a really nice view
and now we're about to go out for dinner
so I'll show you outfit off tonight
so my blouse is this one from Oasis
which you might have seen in my London
Fashion Week vlogs and I also put the
outfit of the day that featured this on
the blog today which is the London
Calling blog post and then these
culottes they're kind of like a silky
material are from Topshop and then my
usual next sandals I only bought these
as my smart pair of shoes so wearing
these most evenings and then my trusty
Rebecca Minkoff clutch
morning guys it is our third and final
day here at inve and the Sun is finally
out travel it behind me is really really
gorgeous in a lake now I'll take you
outside so you can see just how stunning
it is a lovely breakfast I'm seeing as
it's gorgeous today finally to put on
our last day I think mom and I was going
to spend most the day out by the pool
today I got this really cute kind of
like caftan top from a brand called mist
pop I think they're bored so I'll just
show you quickly in the mirror so this
is the caftan eye so it's quite nice for
actually lake garda it's quite kind of
italian looks a lot more expensive than
I'm sure it was and yeah it's got its
really nice detail on the sleeves and
the bikini underneath you can just see
is a brand called thing I want to say
calm bucho but um yeah really nice
pattern there so it's almost tile print
as well but quite Italian as well so
that is my outfit of the day
we've had a really nice afternoon by the
pool it's finally been sunny today and
it's really hot actually I've got a bit
of a bit of tan lines and if you can see
them just always nice and mom and I've
just finished packing up the rooms that
go and check out which is sad but I
thought it's come and enjoy this view
one last time this is my traveling home
outfit nice and comfy this is the blouse
with a nice little open back up can you
see from Dorothy Perkins and these
trousers are ones which are picked up
from Primark they've got that cool like
gem pattern and they're really stretchy
so nice for travelling next shoes and
radley bag which I've been wearing all
holiday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
