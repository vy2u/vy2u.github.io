it's Saturday morning just cooking
breakfast yeah so I have any makeup on
yet I'm filming on my phone this morning
because my camera it's charging
so hopefully the quality is not too bad
it looks quite good in the screen but
you you never know what these things do
you do money
no oh just cooking some poached eggs hmm
not poppies and then you should be quite
chilled day I'm just gonna do a little
bit of work need to do lots of
photography today not gonna go and watch
okay rocket river I'm not gonna go and
watch Charlie play rugby just because
just beeps II guess I won't be having
taste this morning um but yeah they
should be quite a chilled day working
from home again but it's my lovely
friend Vicky's birthday today so we're
going out for birthday drinks with her
in central London so I might do a little
kind of mini get ready with me in the
vlog but yeah just gonna have some
breakfast now and show a Charlie before
he heads off to happy
so I've got bit Nigella on in the
background and I've got my little
snowflake because I just think like why
should I only wear these for one evening
when we've got Christmas jump party so I
thought I'll put these on so the ones
that go best is my outfit I know we
still have a decorated archery we need
to get cracking with that but I'm gonna
do a little bit of wrapping now because
Charlie's has gone Dexter is being kept
entertained with a new bone so yeah I'm
gonna do a little bit of Christmas
wrapping and oh yeah that's what I'm
gonna do
so the doorbell just rang and it was the
postman I completely forgot I had these
on his with me like I was a complete
weirdo but it was another next delivery
I didn't realize I haven't got it all
yesterday and it was this winter candle
the luxury fragrance candle and it
smells exactly the same as german-owned
pomegranate Noir I thought I recognized
the Senate venom when I opened it up and
I've just compared the two and is
actually identical so let's see how it
smells when I light it because that
could be an amazing deal so I've just
finished doing a load of packing and I
also did a mini photo session in the
lounge so I've got my trusty white vinyl
I bought my studio light down because
the lighting is really really bad and I
found this little stocking which I think
was sent to me as part of like a load of
beauty products so I think I'm gonna use
this kind of as Dexter's stocking and
fill it with some of these balloons so
Dex has got a nice little stocking for
Christmas Day as well even though the
Lighting's really bad I think I'm gonna
go outside not outside I think I'm gonna
go upstairs and film a video now because
I'm doing a collab with my friend Gemma
from Gemma London life but one of these
collabs where you don't actually sit
with each other because we just don't
have time for that um so yeah I think
I'm in the mood to film a video so take
my studio lights that's my laundry dryer
not mine studio lights yeah I'm gonna
take that back upstairs and okay one
video is filmed I just did some
Christmas festive party essentials I had
a little bit of help as you can imagine
I was really - throughout that video and
I'm really hoping I don't come across
like too crazy he says a collab with
Gemma and obviously I don't want to be
too cray-cray but yeah I really
shouldn't film I'm just hyper don't know
what it is maybe it's cuz I had about
three I think are the chocolates this
morning but don't tell Charlie cuz he M
he got a little bit angry when I said
about my rules where I get to eat his if
he forgets but yeah I'm now going to
change my jumper and empty my men
Marie card over here and can you tell
I'm really really hyper and yeah I'm
gonna film my stocking for like it I
just finished filming oh yes I just
finished filming um my Christmas
stocking gift guide video I'm so pleased
I bought two softbox lights they need to
just have one and the lighting was so
bad in my videos but I've got two Niles
I've got one over there and one just
here and even though it's really gross
and gray outside the videos do not turn
out too badly so maybe you've noticed
that the lighting in my videos was got
better maybe I haven't um but I'm happy
with it anyway so I'm just doing the
usual tidy up session Dexter is probably
not going to be much help but we'll let
him sleep so that he's not a hooligan
and now I need to rush down to the post
office again um because my friend that
lives in Australia is going back on
Monday and they didn't give her her
present so I need to post it to where
she's staying
you guys don't need to know that but
that's why I'm going to post office but
first I'm gonna have a bowl of soup
because I haven't eaten since breakfast
this morning and it's half-past two now
um so yeah tidy and food
before I do that though I'm just gonna
quickly show you today's prizes and
because I've got them out so I might as
well so at this lovely little bundle so

lovely little selection Dexter is
licking his bits and approval oh you

many different colored eyeshadows Dexter

color eyeshadows in there you've got
some beautiful neutrals some lovely warm
toned excuse me

we were SuperDuper hungry so we had our
Chinese yesterday so I'm just gonna
stick that on if you like today's vlog

so I'm gonna do that I'm just doing
boring stuff so if it's not the world's
most boring vlog in the world even
cooking you anything exciting but I am

be fun to watch so a bit of an update by
what's gonna have soup but then I
realize that chap need eaten all
infrared so didn't have sleep eat so now
really exciting stuff for today's look
um but I had a massive issue with
yesterday's vlog so it's still uploading
even though it's an hour late already so
yeah there's gonna have some pizza paint
my nails and then gonna start getting
ready for tonight's birthday party so I
haven't done my hair Oh makeup yet as
you can see but I'm just deciding which
dress to wear this is my first option
from misguided I just found a black
dress and which is a bit plunging and a
bit shorter and Charlie's like that
looks a bit too young for you which is
slightly depressing so this is option
number one and then this is my second
option so I've got a little Navy blouse
from Oasis my French Connection skirt
which I'm just in love with and when you
misguided Hills to be honest with you
I'm gonna go with this one because I do
feel welcome for in this outfit what do
you think Dex he's just upset that we're
going aren't you pushing me okay so this
is my final look of the evening I put a
little bit of glitter on my eyes from my
stealer palette and and then the large
lashes from the Ilia palette I've got
the Chanel
a lip potion with the gloss fit on my
lips hourglass bronzer which i think is
really nice kind of catches the light
and then you guys have seen my outfit
this one um and then my bag I'm just
taking this little one with me it's a
brand called Labonte I think I've
reached it on the blog a couple of times
before so let's go
so for the first time in my life I've
actually not been an old granny and I've
stayed out until gone midnight and we've
actually been chucked out of the club
and have had one too many poon star
martinis so I'm going to end the vlog
here before I do something that I regret
and I see you guys in the morning all
