you're all well and welcome back to my
youtube video this week I thought I'd
share with you a home where Hall because
I've been buying quite a few things
online and did stories with me namely
from hmm anthropology over bonus and
also a puff of it's from Ikea as well I
have been literally buying all the for
hmm home everything on there at the
moment just seems to be other stuff that
I love and it's coming to summer and my
wardrobes changing so I thought my home
where should also change this sort of
thing let's make that a thing but
basically there is a lot to get through
so I'm not gonna ramble too much I'm
just gonna get cracking the first things
that I picked up from H&amp;amp;M accom are
these incredible cushion covers I was
looking at these a while ago but they
were sold out but then they came back in
store and I picked up two I just thought
they were really beautiful they've got
this kind of diamond d like graphic
print which I just think is really chic
and kind of will bring a bit of pattern
to my living room
um our living room is mostly pastel
colors just plain colors and I really
wanted to inject some more pattern in
there so I thought this was perfect and
they weren't very expensive so I picked
up a couple of these they didn't come
with the in earned in us they didn't
actually come with the inserts so I
bought the internal bit from John Lewis
so now the nice and squishy but yeah
they're absolutely gorgeous I love these
it's gonna pop them back here
I sold video background great I did not
need any more towels this is a complete
impulse buy but they are just so pretty
so I got a couple of this kind of
pattern bath towels they're obviously
very light grey with a white kind of
diamond pattern in them I just think
they're very chic and subtle and they
look really expensive even though
we were not they are really really soft
on this side and a little bit more
textured on the other side I know some
people like quite stiff bath towels I
don't know why I like them really soft
but these are best of both and they also
have this really cute like square
diamond D pattern on the board and it
perfectly matches the pattern on this
towel I also picked up two of these
they've got that same kind of diamond
square pattern on them which i think is
really really cute and pretty and will
look fabulous in my spare bathroom and
so much those I picked up two of these
guest hand towels they came in a set of
two they're really quite small I think
they're more gonna be kind of just for
drying your hands even though they're
not as big as my current hand towels
maybe they're like face cloths but
they've got these little loops on them
so perfect for hanging out behind the
door just for drying hands off so we
have four new towels in total so I'm
pretty much set for towels for the next
few months so don't let me buy any more
towels because I think I might have a
problem also with home kind of
furnishings I picked up this double
duvet set it's got this kind of black
and white pattern almost like a flower
petal kind of like a skeleton flower but
I love the dark and white monochrome I
thought it'd look really good in this
bedroom
my current bed situation here is a black
silk duvet which I've got on upside down
and I works I think it's not
particularly nice so this is the upgrade
and I'm gonna be putting this on the bed
as soon as I finish this video I think
it's really really cute and pretty so
it's gonna look great in yep also for
this room when I want to shake it up a
little bit I pick it up this blanket so
it's gray and it's got kind of like a
Rocky floral kind of pattern on it not
sure if you can see that and it's also
got a bit of like fringing it down the
sides so I'm just gonna use this as a
throw over the top of the duvet just to
kind of change it up a little bit add a
bit more texture to the bed so love this
it's really really big it is actually
officially a blanket so if you need a
blanket then this is really nice
the pile of stuff is like growing next
this is a tablecloth I haven't taken it
out of the packaging X I'm not 100% sure
if I like it I also picked up this same
pattern and a table runner which I think
will look much better but it's a gray
kind of a game with the square and
floral pattern not sure whether to keep
the tablecloth or just keep the runner
but again I thought they're really
lovely like a neutral color so these are
look nice in the dining room and then
finally one more cushion cover at the
same gray square floral pattern not sure
if we like this one again I definitely
prefer other black and white ones but
yeah let me know what you think of the
cushion cover because I don't know
whether to keep it or not yet also from
H&amp;amp;M I picked up their marvel candle
because I love marvel I could not resist
this candle the smell is kind of it's
called pine forest I'd say it's quite a
weak smell it's not gonna make my whole
living room smell of pine forests but
it's really really pretty so I'm just
really glad I picked this up I think it
was a couple of pounds so I have no
problem with spending a couple of pounds
on something that is this cute next home
where shop they went into was oliver
bonus and i picked up firstly this gold
and white storm lantern so I'm gonna be
popping some big candles in here and
maybe putting it outside for some
barbecues I think this will look really
really cute on the patio or you could
even hang it it's got this kind of
twirly wired hanger so you can put it in
the trees or on your washing line I
don't know but I just thought this was
cute and it's rose gold as well it's you
know I love so just I absolutely love
also from all over bonus I picked up
these two absolutely adorable owl
candles now these have a really really
strong fragrance that I can already
smell that and we just got them out the
box and I'd say the fragrance is kind of
gender neutral so if you like live with
a boy or a boyfriend and they are like
your girly smile candles and these I
would say are good for you because they
don't have a very girly scent but it's a
really
nice smell this one is yuzu and green
tea and not really sure that I knew uh
green teas not like it's nice and this
one is thick and Cassie's Cassie I don't
know but it's more of a kind of warm
homey smell and I think they'll be good
for any time of the year they're not
particularly summary or wintry I just
think they're good for all year round
cuteness to your living room
IKEA is always a bit of a stressful
experience I hate that you have to
follow the maze around but they do have
some really cute home stuff in there I
bought loads of bowls and cutlery and
glasses but home where wise of them that
I just picked up this pot and this I
don't know if it's a plant pot or like
an extra large makeup brush holder but I
really loved this like laser effect
metal kind of Gaffey lacy thing at the
top I just thought that was really cute
so not sure I'm gonna use this for yet
but this is something that I picked up
from Ikea and then the last shop is
anthropology and I picked up these two
adorable little ceramic plant pots not
with capsules in them I bought the plant
pots by themselves but they are kind of
like hand-painted glossy on the outside
and terracotta on the inside really
really beautiful plant pots I picked up
the cacti from a local kind of village
fair new and my mum lives and I just
thought they looked really really cute
in these little pots this is obviously
not meant to be used as a plant pot but
I couldn't resist putting my whacker
chilies in it this is one of the
alphabet mugs from Anthropologie they
didn't have a J in fact the only letter
they had left was a letter U and I paid
$2 for this when I went to Texas so this
is now a plant pot not a mug but I just
thought it was adorable and it's got the
rose gold handle which I love and one
which actually does work for my name
this is another mug which I picked up
from Anthropologie and it's got the
letter j on it
it's a really lovely kind of lilac
floral pattern with a little tiny little
handle and as you can see I'm using it
for my makeup brushes I used to have my
brushes in a Kate Spade rose gold and
white candle holder but I smashed it so
this is my new makeup brush holder so
after filming that part of the video I
was feeling even more spendy so I went
on anthropoid comm and I've picked up a
couple more pieces
there's firstly this blue and white mug
which I just saw it I think actually on
someone else's video and fell in love
with it's straight away I mean it's just
really beautiful delicate kind of
Mediterranean style so definitely going
to pop down in the kitchen similar kind
of design there's this blue and white
floral print candle pot it's like a tan
which is going really handy afterwards
I'll probably use it for cotton pads and
it's got a lovely kind of orchid II
sentence let's see what it's officially
called it is Capri blue fragranced
candle and then these two here are both
candles but they've got this beautiful
kind of coal design on the lid which i
think is absolutely incredible
I love all things like to do with the
ocean so yeah this cold signs really
cute I think I probably put both of
these in the bathroom and then there's
this lovely big kind of cracked tile
plant pot not sure what I'm gonna put in
there yet maybe some herbs maybe some
pretty flowers but that's gonna look
lovely either on the patio or in the
lounge somewhere so picked up that a few
new pieces over here as well firstly
these amazing xox old lights have got
the other couple over there and messy
corner
they were kindly sent to me by a brand
called up in lights who reached out to
me over Twitter so thank you guys for
sending me those absolutely love them
and then behind here I have a new candle
which again was kindly sent to me by a
band called Timothy done absolutely love
this beautiful rose gold kind of copper
lid absolutely stunning and the
fragrance is violet and mimosa which I
never thought I'd kind of go for that
sound but it's absolutely stunning and
it matches my lump so absolutely love
that and that is
it that is my recent homework haul I
hope you have enjoyed looking through
all of these items with me I have really
enjoyed going through them again its
kind of reminded me what I bought I
think you know you have a problem when
you need reminding what you bought but
anyway if you have enjoyed this video
