welcome to my Hong Kong beauty and home
well home video this was originally
going to be just a beauty haul but I
actually picked up some really lovely
home where did I say Japan a minute ago
or do I say Hong Kong
I don't know I'm hungover mind blank but
this is most definitely my Hong Kong
beauty haul I have never been to Japan I
don't even know if I said that anyway
Hong Kong home beauty haul and I picked
up quite a lot of bits and bobs a heck
of a lot actually while I was in Hong
Kong last week and my friend Rory he
introduced me to the world of salsa or
salsa and I think I just said the same
pronunciation twice when I went into
loads of different sauces stores and I
bought pretty much a whole load of stuff
every single time he went in and one of
the stores was such a supreme which was
just absolutely gianormous definitely
the biggest beauty shop i think i've
ever been in
we even had breakfast in there I
couldn't stay for lunch and dinner as
well but Rory was like no there are
other things to see in Hong Kong so I
thought I would go through all the bits
and bobs that I bought I haven't tried
any of these bits and bobs yet so if you
have then let me know in the comments
below what you think of them and if you
would like to see me trying them out
then definitely follow along on my
snapchat which is where I do loads of
like first impressions I'll leave my
snapchat username information right here
also while you guys are here I would
love it if you would subscribe to my
channel I have got into a pretty good
routine of having upload schedule and
uploading every Sunday Wednesday and
most Monday's as well and if I'm doing a
weekly vlog Fridays so quite a lot of
videos if you don't want to miss
anything make sure you are subscribed I
will put a little button here so that
you can click Subscribe and but if not
then you can also click a little red
button down there so let's get started
with my Hong Kong beauty haul I'm not
going to do this in any particular order
because I wouldn't know what order to do
it in I just going to pull stuff out of
my magical bag and
you know why I bought it so the first
thing that I've pulled out is an eyelash
case from a brand called dolly wink now
dolly wink I believe is purely like a
Hong Kong or an Asian booty just drop it
in the bag and then with asian beauty
brand because I've never heard of it
before I've never seen this anywhere all
the writing on the back is in Chinese I
think it could be Japanese it could be
Korean I I'm afraid I don't know what
language that is and but yeah this is an
eyelash case this was 35 dollars so
about three pounds and I always leave my
false eyelashes lying around all over
the place on my dressing table behind me
there are two pairs and when I take
these off they will just collect dust so
I thought an eyelash case would be a
really really good idea I guess a
contact lens case would pretty much be
the same thing but I thought that was a
very practical thing to buy and I gave
myself a pat on the back for buying
something so practical so that's the
first thing that I grabbed and then we
have this looks like the same branding
dolly wink but actually I think all the
branding out there is really super cute
and girly very kind of candy is almost
quite like harajuku ish i'm not sure if
that's the right way to to say it but um
i could not tell you what this brand is
because again it's in a language that i
cannot read it says super and i thought
that said super quick and super check
but it says super quick so this is a
brown liquid eyeliner which i have got a
few but the ones that i have dry up
quite quickly and um the shop assistant
was raving about this one so pick this
up and in the photo it looks like a very
fine line minute draws and and this has
got macadamia nut oil and sheer butter
so nice and moisturizing to my eyelids
as well so yeah i will let you know my
snapchat how i get along with this one
next I have another Ono this is an
eyebrow pencil this is a brand called
cyber colors again another brand that
I've never heard of but it looked like a
very similar product to the Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow Wiz it's the same
kind of thing with a spoolie on one end
and a rolled-up liner on the other end
so let's have a little look at this eye
picture one of the lighter shades which
was oh one Brown I think that was the
lighter shade that they had so you've
got
spooley in this end and then here just
like the anesthesia you've got a scroll
up pencil let's have a little play so it
looks like a pretty good color match for
me it's not coming out quite as
intensely as the Anastasia Beverly Hills
but I will give this a go and let you
know how I get on next also from dolly
wink I picked up a little pencil
sharpener
I actually thought I'd lost my eyeliner
sharpener but then I found it so yeah
now I have two and it's just a cute
little heart-shaped liner sharpener so
that's always handy to have in your
makeup drawer and next you're going to
laugh because there are just so many
here this is a whole wad oh my god there
are so many of sheet masks basically
these are just the big thing out in Hong
Kong all the beauty queens out there
Queens Illinois sand beach Queens all
the beauty lovers out there just
obsessed with them they are notorious
for being incredible so I picked up an
absolute shedload of face masks and
these ones I believe were on special
offer I think it was like 10 for some
really ridiculous amount they work how
about 7 P each or something absolutely
mental so they kindly sellotape them all
together I'm going to let you know which
ones I got ok so this top one oh this
top one is a detoxifying oil control
mask umm it's you know which sheet masks
are just the ones you put like the white
bit of paper of your face and it's got
the stuff and all the ingredients
ingrained in it so it really spends his
time soaking in detoxifying oil control
face mask innocence it's got natural
clay in it that's why I pick this one up
because I love clay masks and then from
the same brand which is Sassa tini so I
guess it's a saucer own brand I got the
antioxidant regenerating face mask then
from a different brand which I believe
the brand is called Beyond because it
says it down there these are the ones
that are on special offer so I got some
enzyme masks and multivitamin mask and
aloe vera mask this one I believe is
pearls or green you know green tea
extract pomegranate mask raspberry Mars
and then this one again I keep thinking
it's pearls but screen T so loads of
face masks to try it from that
being there sheet masks which I love
doing I also find them really handy for
traveling because you can just put them
in your hand luggage stick them on an
aeroplane look like an absolute tip for
a few minutes but if you were the
friends and it's just really good fun so
loads and loads of face masks for me to
try next I picked up this little item
and it's um it's actually a face mask in
an orange not a real orange it's a
plastic orange and it's a peeling gel
face mask so I believe this is one of
those gel ones it sets on your face and
then you peel it off which to me is the
most satisfying thing in the whole world
and but also they had samples of these
out on the counter and they smell so
incredible I love citrus scents I just
find it so refreshing and after coming
into summer kind of it's the first day
of spring the day that I'm filming this
and but yeah I thought this would be a
nice kind of summery one so the
packaging is this very snazzy Orange was
it a lime I'm not really sure it's
called Jeju hallabong energy and I
believe the brand is called the Yeon so
inside this you have got alright um oh
it looks like this with a little spoolie
and a little flap you've got a creamy
wow that smells oh my god from home I
hope I really want to eat it it feels so
good literally smells like most amazing
citrus sweets in the whole world
ah so I'm looking forward to them I'll
try I think after like a hot day outside
of the beach or gardening or something
that'll be really nice and refreshing to
use it's called an energy mask so
hopefully it's gonna energize my skin
what else do we have in my bag of
goodies that is a coupon for $100 off
not that I'm probably going to use that
anytime soon um okay this is called the
SOS lip patch I have no idea what this
does and I cannot read any of the
instructions so if anybody knows what
this is or what it does or how I use it
and please let me know in the comments
below because I do not have a clue these
are quite kind of puffy lips so I guess
it might be a bit of a lip buffer like
that's 7 Glory mother pucker lip balm
maybe it has losing
in it which make your lips puff out so
interested to see how this works and if
it works then I have some more face
masks these are really crazy so these
make you look like an animal when you
put them on like they have little animal
caricatures on them they are so obsessed
with sheet masks that they're not happy
with just white sheet masks you have to
look like something when you have them
on obviously not all of them but this is
called a character mask and this is the
sheep version I don't think I realized
it was a sheep eye disorder as a white
fluffy face
see I've got a sheep version and the
Panda version and they are don't even
know if they do anything to your skin oh
yeah
hyaluronic acid and collagen for both of
them
so I will be anti-aging while looking
like a sheep and a panda and then this
one I think again I described the songs
it's so cheap this is a firming face
mask by beauty friends season 3 will be
venom this is a beebowen face mask so
that should be interesting I love how
these ingredients over in the UK are
just so expensive like only the high-end
brands have bee venom in them but this
was less than like a bag of picking next
sweets alrighty next up this looks
painful this is a blackhead removing
strip but I've heard that Korean and
Asian blackhead removing things on mega
intense so I'm a little bit nervous to
try this the brand is I think it's
called cozy cosmic port and soft emo so
really have no idea if that's the brand
or the product and but the diagrams look
painful but they make it look like this
is really going to work so next time I
have like a mega blackhead session I
will be trying these out once again
I will be testing these on my snapchat
again it's just $35 6-3 pounds so
definitely worth a try the next thing
I've got in here are some more black
masks which I believe are again
blackhead pulling out masks don't know
the brand name for this could be Julie
tree it says Jimmy tree down there but
this says deep detox black mask black
sheet mask and then they talking about
Jeju Island something else so GG
I don't know ggs maybe like an
ingredient island or something so loves
your skin problem with close care one
thing that Rory and I laughed about
about the skincare and the beauty of
there is everything is so literal so it
will literally tell you what it was what
it's going to do to you so this will
solve my skin problems that's what it
does that sounds good to me and soothe
your face with toner take the masks out
the package rest for 15 minutes that the
skin absorb the remaining essence so
pretty much like a normal sheet mask
deep detox black mask with volcanic ash
and charcoal I love chocolate a blog
post recently on I should know if it's
like it might be live next week wrote a
blog post recently on the benefits of
chalk off your skin so that's what made
me buy these okie-dokie we are getting
towards the last few bits I picked up
this which is a Maybelline Baby Lips
which I know we have here in the UK but
it's like different packaging and it
looks quite cool in them yeah it was
this doesn't have a price on it that
remember it being super duper cheap so
no openness up it's got the packaging
like this and it's the same kind of
thing as a baby lips crayon no do we
have barely lift crayons we just have
the bombs but this is more the chrome
consistency I got the color candy wow
peach which smells really sweet but
really nice and yeah I just thought
that's a really nice packaging before a
lip balm and I liked how it was pink and
coral kind of colors see I've got one of
those then oh this is rather exciting oh
my gosh I'm wanting to all fall out this
is probably the most expensive thing
that I bought it was $199 which is
around 18 pounds but I actually watched
I think it was huda beauty and I think
it was her I watched her Hong Kong
beauty haul is like look with
inspiration and a bit of advice as to
what to pick up and she recommended this
brand Tony moly
my friend Rory who lives there actually
thought tony moly was a sweet brand oh
nice I think he did I'm not surprised
because a lot of the packaging out there
as I said is really cute so you would
not be blamed if he thought it was a
packet of sweet but this one not so much
this is a big gold box and it's their
snail hydrogel mask collection so this
is probably one of them
most famous products because it contains
the best of their snail collection so I
don't know if you knew but snail goo I'm
not sure what you call it snail slime is
really good at regenerating your skin
you can get snail facials out here and
we haven't really cracked on to the
whole snail goo what do I call it snail
I don't know we haven't really caught on
to it being a real skincare trend but
over in the Asian countries they know
the benefits of it and they're obsessed
with it so in here we've got two gel
masks two intense gel masks and - oh no
oh wow okay take that back so we have
intense care 24 karat gold hydrogel mask
in here God knows how I managed to buy
24 karat gold for 18 pounds intense
cares snail hydrogel mask and timeless
ferment snail hydrogel mask so basically
inside the box we've got these six masks
which are the bestsellers from Tony moly
and they are all with snail or karat
gold in them which is just absolute mint
all sounds so luxurious but actually I
say the most expensive thing that I
bought when really when you think of the
quality of the ingredients and there's
six masks here for less than 20 quid I
think I did really well when you think
like an Estee Lauder mask over here
would be I think I think they're like
fifty pound for three or something
mental but yeah I've got all of these
and they're meant to be amazing for 18
pounds as I said I will be going through
my opinions of them on my snapchat and
if any of them are incredible I'll
feature in my favorites so stay tuned
for my opinions and then the last piece
I think this is the last piece but we
have we have two more face masks again
that super cheap brand so beaut a this
is oh my god this is a placenta face
Mars I think I got this as like an
experiment oh I don't know if I want to
put it on my face what animal placenta
is this or is it human has anyone ever
tried placenta face mask is it safe
shut up it's on my face let me know in
the comments down below
ooh la la although I'm just looking at
ingredients and I can't sleep the center
on here but would they literally put
like placenta in the ingredients list oh
no I think for the sake of wasting 7 P
oh I don't know let me know if you think
I should do this and if I should vlog it
because ah okay and then the next one is
a lot safer this is a green tea essence
face mask maybe I'll do this one after
the placenta one to kind of recover my
skin but gain cheapest chips should I
really be putting a cheap placenta on my
face oh my god I don't know at last but
absolutely not least this is from a
brand called how dunno me and it's their
collagen miss I just saw this was a
really good idea over there they are
really obsessed with collagen it seemed
to be like the fingers brand all over
the place and with this little product
you just spray it directly onto your
face which sounds like a wonderful thing
to do we always need more collagen in
order to keep the skin looking youthful
and this was sixty two dollars so that's
around five pounds correct me if I'm
wrong but I think it's around five
pounds and so I thought it'd be a nice
addition to my skincare routine maybe
when I'm on holiday as well because in
the Sun your skin tends to get a little
bit zapped and yeah I thought this is
quite good price and something cool to
try out as I said in the UK we are just
as obsessed with collagen it's in all of
the top makeup brands all the
moisturizing and everything so Phil
that'd be a good thing to pick up so
that's everything that I picked up from
salsa I have loads of like super
ridiculously long receipts in here and
but another beauty as I said at the
beginning of the video I also picked up
a few little bits of home where I did
pick up some super boring things by the
way I'm sorry about the light I didn't
bother putting my lamps up today cuz
it's quite bright but now I look a bit
of a ghost yeah so I also picked up a
few home rabbits and it was quite funny
actually because Charlie was not with me
on the trip he was at home and he picked
up some super expensive a car number the
name of the brand but they are really
nice I think it's how
envy and picked up some beautiful bowls
and plates from house of envy and
sending some photos being like darling
look what I picked up they're like 15
pound each whatever and as he said that
text I was in a store looking at the
exact same products and they were about
a pound each so I picked up a few bits
and bobs from this home where store that
are the same style as a stuff that
Charlie spent 10 times more so first
thing I picked up our coupler of these
cups or mugs not shorted Collin my try
drinking a green tea atavism it's just
too hot this isn't how I handle um so
maybe I'll just drink like juices out of
it but this annoying I've taken the
price tags off for this is around a
pound and it's this really lovely
Japanese kind of oriental very natural
stoneware with some light stripes on it
and then almost like a burnt effect
around the edge and then everything that
I picked up how and where wise is the
same style so just really quickly go
through it I got a couple of side plates
these this style is really in trend at
the moment I feel like an anthropology
probably end up paying at least 12 pound
for side plate but gain these go around
one pound 20 mark picked up two of these
a blue one and more of a kind of if you
know feral boar paint kind of like a
missile color almost like a sage green
similar to that I got some plates of
this style they've got the light stripes
on them again they're very natural
looking like they've got holes here
where the clay has bubbled a little bit
and some holes not holes like little
bumps in the middle and then they've
been glazed a dishwasher proof and
waterproof and micro proofs are still
really Hardy and just really really like
the style of those I actually have a
feeling this was just in my pile this is
one Charlie bought and from a shop in
Brixton so I'm not going to include that
one but it's the same kind of style then
I got a slightly larger serving plate
and this almost feels I'm not sure if
you can really see the texture but it's
not quite perfectly glazed it feels a
bit like pumice stone and you know that
thing
when it's bumpy you can scrub your dead
foot skin off with yeah it feels a
little bit like a much smoother version
of that and it's very grainy and
textured to touch it almost looks like
it's got pepper sprinkled on it it's
very speckled II again it's not even
perfectly round it's just very very
natural which I love I think I use it as
a serving plate maybe for something like
a tomato mozzarella salad
um and I got a bigger version this is
much bigger definitely a serving plate
this is quite kind of almost Marini I'm
not sure you can really see the pattern
on it it really is beautiful
again with the bumpy pattern in the
middle it looks like looks like they've
almost like thrown salted it to get that
effect which is really really beautiful
again not perfectly round very natural
earthenware style and then lastly
another style of plate which is a little
bit darker and a gray color again very
speckled II very texturized and yeah
very handmade and natural-looking so I
think I spent a grand total of 14 pounds
in that shop I think I did really really
well which is great considering that
stuff pretty much how much one of
Charlie's Bowls co-stars really really
chuffed with that um this shop didn't
even have a name so I'm afraid I can't
tell you where to go to it didn't have
any branding on it at all it was like a
little old lady had a stoneware shop and
we stumbled into it but I will ask for
the street name and put that in the
description box down below so that's
everything that I picked up was not
everything that I picked up in Hong Kong
I did get a few more bits and bobs
that's everything beauty and home wear
wise that I picked up while in Hong Kong
really hope you guys enjoy going through
this with me and I'm really excited to
try these pieces I've had such good
things about so many of these bits and
bobs which are picked up and there's a
few surprises in her as well I'm really
scared to try the placenta face mask and
but yeah following me on snapchat you
like to see my adventures in trying that
and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you're after Hong Kong anytime
soon and have an amazing amazing
time I've put a few blog posts together
on things to do places to go things to
see so I'll link those down below as
well and if you are then safe travels
