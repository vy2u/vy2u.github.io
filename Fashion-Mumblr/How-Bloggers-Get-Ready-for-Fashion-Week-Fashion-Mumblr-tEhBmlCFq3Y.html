having a really fab day so I thought I'd
do another daily vlog today haven't done
one in a little while
I thought I would vlog today so I'm
fairly busy and today is Thursday and
tomorrow is Friday is what normally
happens in a week but tomorrow the point
I'm getting at is tomorrow is the first
day of London Fashion Week the
spring/summer 17 fashion shows and as a
fashion blogger I am doing a fair bit
Fashion Week this season going to a few
shows go meeting some backstage going to
working with a few brands so excuse me
more
puddle Dex is barking at me um so yeah I
thought that I would vlog today because
today is my getting ready for Fashion
Week day and I thought I would share
with you how I get ready for Fashion
Week and how I can imagine a lot of
bloggers get ready for Fashion Week so
yeah as you can probably tell by my
outdoor clothing I have just been out
the house I had a meeting first thing
this morning and then I had a few calls
and then I went to dawdle and I picked
up my blogger mail which I have here
we've got some bags and we've got my
Wally trolley and there's some lovely
outfits for Charlie as well so first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
very quickly have a little rummage
through the blogger mail not going to
open up everything because I actually
have to be out the house in 45 minutes
to go to a very last-minute shoot so I'm
working with a brand on a blog post
actually the blog post is also how I get
ready for Fashion Week and I didn't
actually realize what the deadline is
tomorrow so I need to go and quickly
shoot that luckily a photographer the
lovely Victoria who shot my Dorothy
Perkins campaign was available so we're
going to go put on something again we're
going to go to Santa house and shoot
that 1923 - but yeah I'm going to open
up a few bits and bobs the most
important bits for me to open up today
are from fashion brands so as you may be
able to guess a lot of the stuff that
bloggers were during Fashion Week has
been very very kindly sent to us by
brands and brands obviously want us to
feature their clothes in blogs in
YouTube videos because fashion week is a
time where we capture a lot
content so it's incredibly generous of
brands I've got I've already had an
appointment with Rhys and I've chosen
some gorgeous outfit including this coat
which I'm so in love with Oh so um I'm
going to be doing a video all about my
fashion week outfit so keep lookout that
to see that on I just love it
that was one and I have a bag of goodies
here from Jager and also a bag with some
tops in from Karen Millen so I'm going
to open up those and then that should be
the last of my Fashion Week bits and
bobs that I've been sent so it means
that I can start planning my outfit so
let's see what we've got right and once
I know changing okay everything is
unboxed and I cannot believe how
generous these friends have been and I
feel very very lucky and very fortunate
to be able to be wearing these gorgeous
pieces so thank you to Karen Millen
Jaeger and Rhys in particular for
absolutely spoiling me and this season
they're behind me these are some of my
favourite pieces I haven't got all the
reef pieces that I've actually put here
in the wash because they've already worn
them because I got so excited to add
them um but yeah as you can see I've got
a couple of beautiful coats from jäger
this one is more of a wool material and
gorgeous kind of like an ombre gray he's
got different gray panels and then this
one I'm so excited to try this because
it's not like anything that I've ever
won before style wise kind of like a
boyfriend blazer in this pure white so I
need to be super careful how much makeup
I put my face because I do not want to
ruin that with makeup villages and then
also hidden away behind the coat this
pink jumper you can see that from jäger
I can tell that it's going to be a
favorite it's such a gorgeous color then
from Karen Millen they are launching
they're calling it the white shirt
project so we've got tons of gorgeous
classic and very stylish white shirts
including this one here so I'm going to
start that up potentially with my
Riis new leather trousers which are
these ones here after stunning I
actually wouldn't have picked these out
to myself to one of the girls in the
store pointed amount to me tried them on
and I fell in love and I'll evening
Saudis it smells down below but I feel
like they'll quite a good price to Reese
recent leather trousers
so yes only the info down below um and
then also from Karen Millen I've got two
other beautiful white tops so I had to
adjust my hands with cameras getting
heavy two other white tops here they are
both very beautiful classic tops with in
frill detail and then this one is just a
really beautiful kind of peplum shape so
my tactic I know a lot of fashion
bloggers they will literally plan their
outfit day by day they'll be like Monday
I'm going to wear this Tuesday gonna
wear this well I personally don't find
that works for me so what I like to do
is dedicate a section of my wardrobe
towards things I would love to somehow
fit into my fashion week wardrobe so
what I'm going to do is kind of use say
this coax it's quite bold as a divider
and then everything because outside of
it is going to be Fashion Week outfit so
that hopefully I will try to squeeze in
all the bits that kind even sent by the
brand and then basically every day
during Fashion Week I'll be working with
a photographer and hopefully capture
some really gorgeous content for them I
mean very quickly I have a look through
some of my other blogger mail and I
don't think I'm gonna have time to show
you how many three but hopefully I'll be
able to do another blogger mail video
before I go away on our trips because
yeah as a submission a photographer and
then I'm getting my hair done so I'll
take you along with me to those but ya
know open up a couple of bits and then
time to get moving
I just quickly vlog this one because of
the theme of this video so skinned
Iceland have sent me a little box and it
looks like a medical tin and sons are so
cute and it says JCPS on and close to
your lfw SOS survival kit so let's see
what they put inside my kit for
providing them the fashion week this box
is so cute I'm definitely using like
classes and things for you pocket side
pouches Pether not perfect for a quick
burst of energy pre or post show very
good idea because yes awesome yet time
to a proper meal during Fashion Week I'm
sure we don't need to introduce you to
Baraka at handy on a go sachet that
doesn't need to make some water
um devolve dissolves on your tongue
again amazing keeping energy levels up
busy and stressful daily linkage get
yourself relaxed with a cup of tea carry
a flipper
Carla convenient keep you focused and
relaxed whilst a snoring piece coverage
we catch up with those ease that's
amazing and such a lovely idea
this is cheeky both think it's a little
card gift card for get cheeky which is
the nail salon in hi hope and so that's
amazingly generous and ok and let's see
what the products are Wow
so skinned Iceland is one of the brands
that does these amazing lip plumping
masks so it's on a couple of those we've
also got oh well Hydra cool firming face
gel to the forehead in case my furrowed
brow gets too much during Fashion Week
and we've got blue clay fresh start mask
with ice age mud I realize that was
really unflattering and I completely
miss my face loss tell me about that but
that sounds really cool and we're all
this box is so cool firming eye gels
much-needed my eye bags during Fashion
Week are another level and then we've
got a little bit and are you interested
sausage and then we've got loads more
pampering thing from skin those clothes

many mask that is amazing thank you so
much skin Iceland Dexter and I approve
alright so I'm in central London now
discuss some of the house and I'm gonna
meet Victoria here we've got about an
hour to try and get Aesop's for my blog
post that's got to go live tomorrow and
I also want to shoot some beauty images
so let's give em right up
alright so I'm sorry this smoker panel
at higgledy-piggledy here they're the
one those days
so between I just had a successful
issues at Somerset House we got loads of
lovely imagery always monitoring and I
will put some of those photos on the
screen now as you can see what we shot
and I'm now on the way to the
hairdresser and I'm probably going to
edit the images that Victorian HS shot
well getting my hair done at
multitasking at its finest but that's
pretty much what it's like all the time
in the lead-up to Fashion Week it's
filled with deadlines and all of that
all of those joys I think we really here
now heading into the Johansson southern
I have been putting off getting
libraries touched up in
the clothes off so getting that on as a
matter of urgency the whole Fashion Week
so yeah while I'm not going to editor
the blog post I like to get a lot of my
content pre schedules before Fashion
Week because I don't have to worry about
any videos or any blog posts or even
tweet while I'm at the - in between
shows what I'm going to do is get this
one blog post edited and then I'm going
to schedule in maybe three or four blog
posts to go live during Fashion Week and
even schedule all my tweets during the
week so I can just sit back and relax or
just concentrate on being in the right
place the right time for the shows and I
have to worry about the content going
live
that's the time and yeah when only here
that I get to happen
okay I'm sorry if that was really
awkward but obviously it's just myself
and the taxi driver in the car so I felt
like I was being really stunted with
what I was saying and I was I come
quietly yes I have okay just got some
someone so let's go
okay so I'm in the salon and looking a
little bit like a zombie mixed with Miss
Diaz Malfoy that's the vibe that I'm
feeling right now
and have them gloves before now because
I'm only this or this area myself I
might find it very awkward blogging and
so on and they're basically the lovely
tulips in my heritage that have got so
many highlights in fact that you might
as well do a full color and why I've
gone for the painted on look this is
going to make my roots completely blonde
and then we're going to turn the rest of
my hands at all one color and that
lovely kind of great article oh it comes
up with so looking voicing there that's
like and also it's so much quicker than
when I get highlights - in the past I've
been in the family for seven hours no
word of a lie and this took like 20
minutes to arm and it's going to be
setting for an hour has also been set up
with some and his bread which is amazing
in fact you are craving and also a
banana here and deep smoothie with
onions try and spirit of amazing so any
comments I sneak food I'm very impressed
with so fast your hamster's very happy
girl and the truck enormous works well
and they got Wi-Fi charging points so
yeah productive at getting my husband
good morning it is Friday apologies I
didn't finish that love off probably
yesterday but I was about four I was in
the hair salon and then I was a little
bit tired when I got home so didn't
finish it off hair is looking good it is
definitely much much blonder than that
I've ever been before it took a few goes
with the toner to get it the right shade
because after the bleach because it was
the first time I had been bleached it
was a little bit yellow so yeah we had a
few a few tones but now I'm really
really happy with it so yeah it's the
first day of London Fashion Week today I
have been spending the morning catching
with emails scheduling posts and pretty
much planning my day making sure I know
exactly where I need to be at what time
so I'm going to head off now and I've
got my meeting first thing this morning
I'm going to the fire fetch offices and
then I'm meeting a couple of other
people around the office tree area which
not too familiar with that area but yeah
so I will quickly show you my outfit
today oh and I also use some of the bits
involved from the skin Iceland
London Fashion Week's survival kit which
I showed you earlier I used this morning
the plumping lip gel which is really
funny I had put like a sheet of plastic
kind of over my lips but they feel
lovely and smooth my lips are very plump
anyway so it didn't really do too much
plumping this isn't them but I also used
some of the skin Iceland
under-eye moisturization and mask and
yeah that felt really lovely so I feel
nice and comfortable to go so that's
pretty much my Fashion Week preparation
I haven't had time to do my nails but
I'm hoping I might be able to get them
done later today so I'm actually going
to finish this vlog here after showing
my outfit and then start blogging again
with my Fashion Week vlog so hopefully
you guys will tune in for that one as
well hope you enjoyed this one the edge

wreath I add school this jumper the
neckline the way that it hangs on the
body you'll see in my fashion week
outfit very video how it looks without
the coat just absolutely adore this
junker and then I'm wearing my leather
leggings which are also from wreath

high-waisted elasticated waist band and
then they've got this quilted section
which I find this makes them look really
really cool and then my shoes are these
mules also from reef with a very
fashionable pointed toe and they are
like a grey suede material so I'm big
fan of those I'm also going to be taking
