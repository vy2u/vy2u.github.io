now nothing at all
I used to pick you up and child to place
we could talk for hours sometimes we'd
run out of words to say but we didn't
mind cuz we could lay on the ground
understand to each other's eyes good
morning a very different start to the
vlog this week because Charlie and I and
my mum are skiing I'm a bit puffy faced
I feel like I haven't properly woken up
yet this morning it's quite early
because we wanted to make the most of
our four days here and get lots of
skiing in Charlie and I have well I've
not been skiing in about seven years my
mum's not been skiing in four years and
Charlie has not skied since those 12 so
we're getting an instructor this morning
I'm really looking forward to getting
back on the slopes but has been a long
time I used to be quite good so
hopefully I will pick it up again
everyone says it's a bit like riding a
bike so fingers crossed that will be the
case but I thought I would vlog the week
as usual show you what we're doing what
I'm wearing so let me tell you about
yesterday so we arrived yesterday which
was Sunday and we got picked up from
Salzburg Airport really quick flights an
hour and a half from Gatwick we got
picked up in a very futuristic car it
was an electric Tesla and it drove us
all the way up to foster farm which is
the name of a hotel that we're staying
at which is in a town or near a town
called Leo gang which is up in the
Austrian mountains the whole hotel is
very eco conscious the room for example
doesn't have any metal or glue in it so
it's really good for allowing you to
sleep well breathe well etc and
location-wise behind me here is
literally the ski slope so very much ski
in ski out so we're meeting your
instructor at 9:45 I'm just head to toe
in my ski gear already sweaty Betty
thermals and my very slimming
I think the ski trousers these are from
a brand called it dare to be show you
the full outfit of the day later we're
gonna head down for breakfast now I
see you later
okay so we've been skiing their own
structure of about an hour now mum and
slow just coming up behind
he's just teaching us lots of technique
bits which is really good here she comes
yeah they're good
yeah excuse the crazy lighting yeah so I
give you a very quick out to the evening
Lennar has done her hair like they did
it during upload right until look
fabulous gorgeous very good and what are
you wearing tonight Allah beautiful
notice could be coast
I think the scarf is Boston yellow face
eight gorgeous and an Italian stretch
nothing fuck-you bottom Thank You Holly
and Max it's a suede gorgeous very good
Nina Ricci at Nobu champing Gucci
glasses very stylish I'll show you my
outfit of the evening in the mirror the
lighting is rather cray-cray and so it's
obviously a few hours later since we
were skiing I actually didn't bring
money clothes in there it's all full of
ski gear in my suitcase but this is my
Club Monaco cashmere jumper just tie my
hair to loose ponytail my fabulous JW
Anderson Pierce bag which I got just for
this holiday in the sale then these are
my River Island trousers and actually
I've stolen mum's shoes these are the
Gucci jeeps from ego
nobody let's go
but you see this is my this is my 30
seconds the destruction of yourself do
it
get off get off no no wait offensive
bogan
good morning it is Tuesday and today we
woke up to a little bit of a white house
the clouds were all the way down on the
slopes behind me and couldn't really see
your hand out in front of you so we
decided not to head out skiing first
thing although typically the clouds are
lifting Nowra sings and blue skies but
mum and I are booked in for some
massages this morning which I'm very
much looking forward to the owner last
night was showing us around and he said
that 80 to 85% of the food they serve
here is organic and regionally sourced
and then similarly in the spa the oils
that they'll be using on us this morning
are made from local locally collected
Mountain herbs and they smell absolutely
divine it so we're gonna head up to the
spine out so I will see you after our
treatment
all right so it all chalked up after our
massages which were lovely very simple
nothing to say now say mr. good old
massage using their homemade oils which
is really lovely as you I've got to get
a point now in a cable car and we are
heading up to not sure what the actual
place is called but we're heading up
somewhere high I'm gonna get some nice
luncheon tea now be a good time showing
my ski outfit got my helmet on of course
you know safety first and then I've got
my Kate Spade sunglasses I do have
goggles in my little bag as well
everyone on Instagram yesterday was like
Josie
only you would ski with a Gucci bag but
I think it completes the outfit
perfectly my scarf as well last time I
went skiing I was probably about 17 18
yeah don't think it had much much worse
skating fashion sense then and then my
jackets which I love it's got this kind
of like stretchy detail it's very
flattering as a brand called it dare to
be as all my child trials and they're
also very slim fit so very flat ski get
very warm so far I am a big fan this is
the only time you'll see me dressed head
to toe in black yeah and then I've got
my little my Chevron bag which I love
and my ski gloves I've had these for
many years they're a brand called Roush
and that's about it really I've got my
specially Betty sandals on underneath
which again I love so yes with some good
shell is another ski outfit right what
you're wearing darling this is hunter
this is a really cool independent man
called a Van Loon sport hmm nice roll
neck I'm almost too toasty yeah yeah I
actually wear this every day yeah yeah
well it's sort of a bit late now
don't walking and what about you what
the Japanese
it's an Italian Rex Travis my self
itself to Nene okay an Italian brand and
helmet and them
dayglo boots they are very very case I
get lost head person's jacket just in
case you lose them this is Charlie's
first time on skis since he was about 12
yesterday when he was hurting too much
15 years which rights to you I'll just
stop first yeah I think I've got a
career at the Olympics way serious not
about showing Eddie Eagle that I reckon
I've set some speed records but they'll
be my pals
here we go
right Charlie's in the orange not that
guy that's clearly really good I have a
feeling hope he's down he's down but he
from still there is Charlie Owens come
on darling
you can do it jack
stand up a little straighter
y'okay control
dumb question to me
is relaxed showing us how it's done
now it's nice
almost finished skiing for the day doing
the last rundown I'm just waiting for
Charlie luck I think Charles getting a
little bit old a little bit impatient
but he's doing well here they come
the trivia mm Charla's
yea-ah done darling
hotel now after a full day of skiing
feeling quite exhausted I think I might
head up for a bar shortly I just want to
show you how beautiful our current view
is there's nobody on the slopes at the
moment because the lifts
shut up 5:00 and it's about quarter past
so it's just all very peaceful look at
this
it's very currency
with the pressure on your skis and for
the next turn up your heel weighted
Hollow
the truth is not
yeah somebody
there what good morning it is Wednesday
it's our final day skiing today and we
have got the most perfect day blue skies
look at that a little bit slushy down
here because we're quite far down with
just skied from the highest point in the
lea gang ski area and we're nearly at
the bottom with the cable car is we're
gonna head back up to the top but it
could be utiful this slope is all
through the trees I better go and meet
mom and lovely n our instructor
otherwise I'm getting on the list for
that night
look at this ski store in front of me
it's so cute I'm going
but my blinded eyes can't
I can't trust it be
so I keep honoring
I feel you feel that true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
