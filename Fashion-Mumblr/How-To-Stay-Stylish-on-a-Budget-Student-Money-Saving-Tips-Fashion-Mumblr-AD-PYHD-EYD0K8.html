for joining me for today's video it's
going to be all about how I state
stylish on a budget in particular I'm
going to be throwing it back to when I
was a student at the London College of
Fashion and how I fudge appeared and how
I can afford to stay fashionable as a
student today's video is in
collaboration with NatWest I have been
thanking them for nearly 10 years so
thank you to them for sponsoring today's
video and without further ado let's get
started so my first tip is all around
being a savvy shopper when you're at
university you're meeting lots of new
people you want to make a great first
impression but you don't want to spend
hundreds or thousands of pounds on a
whole new wardrobe so for that reason I
love buying dupes you guys already know
this if you've watched my videos in the
past but I have a few go to websites
including 'seeing mango Zara I think
when I was a student probably 90% of my
wardrobe is from Zara and they have so
many fabulous suits you can get a really
high fashion look but at a fraction of
the price of course along those same
lines getting the high-fashion look for
last is keeping your eye on the sale
rail there's often really good bargains
to be had
places like Topshop they've got a large
chunk by rail and I always have my eye
on places like that picking up some
fashion bargains a lot of stores as well
offer very generous student discounts so
make sure you are fully sorted up on
what kind of discounts are available to
you and that ranges from clothes stores
to places where you can eat places away
from my makeup the lists are endless so
definitely make sure you are very
up-to-date with your TV discounts my
second tip would be to get a fashion job
so when I started at the London College
of Fashion I actually came to London for
a day trip a couple of weeks before term
started because I knew that especially
in London the jobs are going to be
really really competitive and I wanted
to beat the crowds so I definitely
recommend doing something along these
lines so I came with the London two
weeks before my course started armed
with folders full of TVs and cover
letters and I went around to all my
favourite stores and handle them in so
by the time time came round I was
already employed by Topshop in
Knightsbridge and that meant I could get
a staff discount I already had a group
of girls but I knew in the area
working there and on that note working
retail is just an amazing way to make
friends I've got friends for life Guldur
works with a place like Topshop and Rhys
so highly recommend getting yourself a
fashioned job full of discounts for the
free clothes and just as a lifestyle and
the friends that you makes as well I
would however say that the one downside
to getting a job in retail especially as
a fashion student is that of course you
get to see all the major styles as soon
as they're released that can be very
tempting to put your paycheck straight
back into the store so self-control is
definitely something to practice if you
do get the job in retail my third tip is
all about being aware of your finances
and this is wet and that West comes in
so whenever the student and now for this
day they're mobile banking app can be a
bit of a lifesaver
so of course you want to make sure
you're aware of what's coming in and
more importantly what's going out of
your bank account is to make sure you
stay within your limits what I find
really useful is just keeping an eye on
the transaction it can help make you a
little bit more aware of where you might
be overspending perhaps at five pound
coffee every day we're at 40 pound bill
at the burger restaurant on a Friday
should help you be a little bit more
aware of your finances so that when
you're shopping you know exactly how
much you've got spend other perks of the
app includes you can use a service
called get cash to a draw cash I think
it's at 130 pounds and let me tell you
from experience that is a major life
saver
perhaps on nights out things like that
also if you're out with your friends and
someone owes you and thinks you can
easily transfer money between bank
accounts just using a mobile phone
number that's another really really
handy service and for your own bank
accounts as well if you do need to dip
into your savings or transfer money
between accounts you can do that really
quickly and easily all on the mobile
banking app other benefit of having a
network student accounts include their
coach card gives you a third of loads of
different transport perhaps if you're
going back to your parents villa far
away or you just wanna go on a day trip
you can save up to 1/3 on travel and
then finally they're overdraft service
which means that as a student you can
get an interest-free overdraft it's up
to 500 pounds in term one and then it's
a 2,000 pounds in the subsequent terms
and this just comes in really really
handy especially if you just need their
help tie ends together between payday
and your shopping trip my next tip would
be to be sewing machine
so for me this meant spending a little
bit of extra time with my mom
watching her actually would take on my
childhood taking my tops and dresses
because if you've got the skills to take
in your clothing then it means you don't
need to spend money taking them to a
tailor it means you can buy in more
affordable clothes and make them fit you
better which makes them looks so much
more expensive I actually shared a few
more tips on how to get a little bit
more of a luxury look to your water
without spending all of your pennies in
a video I did last week and leave that
one on the screen if you want to know
more about how to make outfits with more
expensive but definitely themed sewing
machine Savi saved me a lot of money
when I was university I would even go to
shops and take close up pictures of
garments and try and recreate them
myself I actually recreated an ALICE
Templi wedding dress I wanted to wear to
one of my proms and that saved me a few
thousand pounds so while I don't
recommend going to those extremes just
knowing how to take your clothes in and
make little DIY alterations is
definitely in handy skills have tip
number 5 is to always keep your shopping
receipt and keep the tags on your
clothes at least for a month after you
buy them there's me I have a little rule
that if I don't wear things within three
weeks of buying them and chances are I'm
not going to wear them so I had this
section in my wardrobe or I think I
closed around in my first Union room and
I would always put my new things to one
end of the rail if after a few weeks I
noticed that something was still there
unborn then I would take it back because
in my head that meant that I was not
going to wear it when it comes to buying
things you don't need I also had another
rule in my head while I was shopping and
that was if you can think of three
reasons why you should buy something
then you shouldn't
so these reasons could be that you can't
afford it that you think it's not going
to be a trend for very long or maybe
your friend has something some of you
can borrow if you can think of three
reasons then chances are it's not to be
so that's another way to be a savvy
shopper when you're students and then
finally I would advise making the most
of samples so I was very thrifty when I
as a student and I was quite lucky in
that my campus was actually in the
center of London so I made the most of
when they hand out free things on the
streets which yes it really does happen
in London sometime you can get like
proper full-size
packets of simple face wipes for example
free chocolate bar things like that but
also makeup counters are really generous
they're giving you
in the hope that you will try before you
buy sometimes when I needed to make ends
meet and I've run out the foundation I
would go to the beauty counters and ask
for example same applies for things like
serums and moisturizers always keep hold
for these little magazine sachets I
actually have a shoebox under my bed
filled with travel minis that I've
picked up from all kinds of places and
they come in so handy so there's my top
tips for how to be stylish on a budget a
few ways that I've budgeted pass the
students I really hope you guys found
this video useful and that you picked up
a few tips I'm sure you guys have got
those tips as well so please share the
tips on budgeting in the comment section
down below I will really enjoy reading
through them and hopefully by sharing

from each other which would be fabulous
