autumn trends at this time of year both
our wardrobes and our beauty routines
are starting to transition and today's
video is in collaboration with Elizabeth
Arden's for each look I'll be showing
you how I complete my outfit with a
lipstick from their new range that
you'll also crush starting off with my
go-to everyday look I like to keep my
makeup really natural and fresh so I
reach for the Elizabeth Arden plump up
lip gelato in bear kiss every autumn
wardrobe needs to go to chic yet
comfortable look and the same goes for
your makeup the gelato plush up lipstick
gives a smooth lip color which is
beautifully moisturizing as you apply
the lip color melts onto the lips just
like gelato for my day-to-day look my
autumn uniform consists of cutoff jeans
and a cozy net I complete with some
standout accessories such as these
ponies skin meals and a statement chic
bag equally chic is my lipstick how
sleek is as packaging I top it up while
on the go for another hit of moisture
and color there are a few easy ways to
switch up your jumper and jeans combo
for something a little more stylish and
sassy for the evening and in this case
I've faced my look around the color of
the season red as well as switching up
my top I'm applying the cherry up plump
up lip gelato red is a bold shade but
the sheer and shiny finish of the
lipstick formula makes it so easy to
wear and it's creamy and weightless on
the lips to bring out my lipstick shade
I've added pops of red accessories
including trading my animal print mules
for bold red ones and a floral bag too
it's such an easy way to switch up a
look to make it more appropriate for
evenings and events and it's amazing
what a pop of red lipstick can do to
your confidence as well
look number three is quite possibly my
favorite maxi dresses in an autumnal
shade are such an easy piece to wear all
you have to do is add a statement lip
and your look is complete I've opted for
strawberry sorbet and I'm defining and
contouring my lips first with the plump
up lip liner which not only shapes but
also helps my look to last even longer
the water-based consistency of the
lipstick is almost balm like so even the
most vivid of shades are comfortable all
day long I finish with a touch of
lightweight blush the cool glow cheek
tint from Elizabeth Arden and my look is
complete
the vivid hues from the lipstick bring
out the pinky tones in the floral dress
and I've accentuated the waist with a
studded belt another texture has been
bought into this look with my suede
shoes and faux fur bag and oh look
what's inside it's time to top out for
another hit of addictive plumping effect
and soft cooling sensation upon
application of the lipstick the fourth
look is perfect for evenings I never
would have thought I'd suit a plum lip
shade but the gelato like texture of the
lipstick gives a sheer wash of color you
can build up as much or as little as you
like I'm somewhat of a beginner when it
comes to darker toned lipsticks so I've
softened the look by using a tissue to
blot and remove excess shine my lip
shade perfectly matches with one of
autumns recurring color trends and I've
accessorized with a vivid
oxblood shade bag and a cactus print
jumpsuit I adore the tailoring on this
jumpsuit it gives a feminine silhouette
but has somewhat of a professional power
suit effect another key autumn trend is
tassels so I've chosen this suede coat
to add another texture and finish to the
look and my suede pointed toe flats to
finish
finally I couldn't do an entire lookbook
without a pink outfit I'm a huge fan of
a coral lip any time of year so I've
opted for tangerine dream for my final
outfit the formula of the collection
makes them so perfect for both summer
holidays and autumn outfits they're just
so comfortable to wear my outfit while
pink and on trend with the asymmetric
hem of the skirt and the balloon effect
on the sleeves of the net has comfort at
its heart just like the lipsticks and I
complete the look with two of autumns
key textures a faux fur coat and a suede
bag both pink of course
