was cool hi guys and welcome back to my
channel in today's video I wanted to
share with you a few tips and show you
how I pack my carry-on for a budget
airline and the reason why I
specifically say a budget airline is
because they can be really strict when
it comes to the one piece of hand
luggage rule so if you're carrying even
the smallest handbag you have to squeeze
that into your hand luggage and before
you get on the airplane so you have to
be super super strict with yourself when
it comes to packing I found that I've
been doing quite a few more trips that
require only hand luggage
recently and there's a few benefits to
this firstly if you're traveling with a
budget airline like Ryan error easyJet
they really do whack on the charges for
your hold luggage it's something like 35
pounds away each way and I'd rather save
that 70 pounds and save time at the
other end and just take the carry-on if
I'm only going for three or four even
five days I find that carry-on actually
can fit everything that I need with a
little bit of careful planning in a few
hours time I'm heading to Sicily with
Charlie and Sophie and met a couple of
our friends and we are just taking
carry-on luggage so I thought I would
share with you my packing process and a
few tips on how I managed to get
everything I need for a four-day holiday
in just one small case
so my first tip and something which I do
no matter how long the holiday where I'm
going for a weekend whether it's in the
UK or abroad or two weeks in Australia I
always check the weather of the
destination first so I just use the
weather on my iPhone it's usually fairly
reliable luckily while we're going it's
same all Sun but it's really important
to also check the temperatures in the
evenings sometimes I've gone on lovely
holidays and not checked how cool it
gets in the evening and I've not taken a
jacket or anything warming up so
definitely check the evening evening
temperature as well based on this the
next thing I do is plan my outfits but
before I plan the outfits for the actual
trip I plan the outfit that I'm going to
wear while traveling I usually tend to
wear the heaviest on bulkiest items so I
don't have to put them in my case so for
this trip I'm going to be wearing my
leather jacket and my wedge sandals
because these are definitely the
bulkiest pieces and I don't have room
for them in my case also if I want to
take a hat on the holiday I wear that to
travel this one's actually great it does
crush down so I wouldn't damage it but
again it's taking up valuable suitcase
space and the airline can't tell you off
for wearing a hat on the plane so I'll
wear this to travel next is to pack the
outfit so you're going to wear while
you're on the trip and for me personally
I prefer to not give myself too many
options while I'm away I'll lay the
clothes onto the bed outfit by outfit
including shoes accessories even
sometimes sunglasses as well and then
I'll try on the outfit and take a snap
on my phone then when I'm away I can
just scroll through the four or five
images on my phone and a sidewalk outfit
I want to wear each day it sounds kind
of crazy but that way I don't end up
packing loads of extra items that I
don't need and won't wear and it also
takes the stress off you don't really
have to decide too much when you're in
holiday which is really really nice
something our always pack is a really
versatile top actually this one here I'm
wearing this to travel today it's just a
plain white top and it goes with so many
bottoms it goes with shorts high-waisted
trousers and beautiful
waisted skirts so another tip would be
to take really versatile items you can
mix and match between outfits similarly
to mixing and matching it's a really
good idea if all what if your outfits
are along a similar color palette
because that will really help you to mix
and match different tops and bottoms so
for example for South Africa I was
really nudie and then also a few kind of
earthy tones where as for Sicily I'm
going with blues and whites for a cliche
Italian I know that by sticking to one
color palette it makes it a lot more
easy to mix and match your different
items this is only something I've been
trying recently but since I have started
I really do notice I can fit a lot more
in my case and nuts to roll in my items
so I start by folding them and then roll
them really tightly and I find by doing
this I can actually fit about 1/3 or
more items in my case which is really
great because it means I have more room
for things like makeup and maybe a
hairdryer just a little luxuries
something that I always do is stuff
things that sounds really weird but I
will always stuff my trainers with
bikinis I will stuff my handbags with
cotton pads just making sure that every
bit of space is fully utilized
other tip when you are packing a
carry-on is to keep all of your liquids
in one place when it comes to liquids
I'm the biggest fan of travel size minis
I collect them from my search box from
offense even from magazines and I store
them all in a massive box under my bed
and then when it comes to holiday I'll
pick and choose my favorite ones and
make sure that I have my full routine so
I've got a mini moisturiser night cream
eye cream and just everything basically
serums and I also love to collect
sachets I have such a so I've got again
from magazines and ones that I've picked
up from counter so things like shampoo
and conditioner which can be bulky I
just take sachets and I find that really
really useful any cosmetics that are too
big like this night cream which I'm
obsessed with at the moment I just use
the end of a spoon and tip it into a
loogey pot and then sometimes I'm
forgetful so I also write on the pot
what's on the side so that saves me
taking a big bulky glass container once
you've got all your liquids in one place
I would recommend that you leave this
bag very accessible within your luggage
because you're going to have to open up
your bag and take it out when you go
through security so it's wise to keep
all of your liquids in one place in a
clear bag you can just pop out when it
comes to going it through the scanner
any makeup that's not liquid like
powders and also makeup brushes I put in
a separate bag and that can go deeper
within the suitcase because I won't need
to get that out during the flight having
said all that about the whole one piece
of hand luggage rule I always try and
risk it sometimes they're friendly and
they let you take two so normally I will
take a hand bag with me for an
additional piece of carry-on luggage but
I always make sure it's one that will
flatten and will fit into my suitcase
just in case they are being super strict
for this trip I'm taking this strong one
which I pick it up from forever 21 I
won't mind crushing it a little bit in
my suitcase and I have
that have been approved in my hand
luggage to do exactly that should the
need arise but India or cute things I
need really accessible like my purse and
a little bit of makeup my earphones I
will put my laptop in here as well so I
can like on the plane and this means you
can put your suitcase in the overhead
compartment meaning you don't have to
flap around too much on the plane but
always always always make sure that you
do have room for it in your suitcase
just in case they are being super strict
that day and so those are my tips for
packing a carry-on bag for budget
airlines if you're off anywhere soon and
I hope you have a really really lovely
time hopefully you guys are still
enjoying everyday may I think bar one
day when I should have wife and
Lanzarote so far I have managed to
upload a video every single day as you
can probably hear I'm just a little bit
poorly still a little bit bummed up but
hopefully some sunshine will do you meet
the world of good and I'll be healed
before you know it as well as the vlogs
you can keep up with my travels over on
my snapchat which is Josie LDN the same
as my Instagram are we snapping
absolutely loads in Sicily I'm not sure
what the Internet's going to be like but
I will try to upload blogs as well
that's all from me I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I'll see you guys
soon hi
