another daily vlog it is Sunday today so
quite a chill today in the fear and ions
household but of course I'm taking you
along with me showing you guys what
we're getting up to this weekend so it
is about half past eleven now we've had
a very chilled morning so far Charlie
made avocado on toast it's just really
really nice when I edited a couple of
videos while we were just kind of
sitting on the sofa downstairs
eyebrow update so they are looking good
they're pretty dark at the moment
because the same as last time they
bigger bit darker before they heal so it
won't be this dark when they are
finished but yeah looking really really
good and there's no discomfort
whatsoever they're a little bit shy at
the moment so I just put some coconut
oil on so every morning and evening I
meant to put on a little bit of coconut
oil which just keeps them hydrated and
helps the healing process I wanted to
show you what I'm wearing as well
because I just got this in the post a
couple of days ago and is so so
beautiful let me just flip the camera
around so this very snazzy gym outfit
that I'm wearing and yes we are gonna go
to the gym not just wearing it for fun
is from the Matthew Williamson for USA
Pro range and I've never actually tried
anything from USA Pro before but when I
saw this collaboration I kind of fell in
love with it a little bit I absolutely
adore Matthew Williamson prints and I've
been really getting into like you know
more stylish gym wear recently this
one's got so many gorgeous details it's
got this gold sip with the MW logo on it
it's got this beautiful print which is a
Matthew Williamson print of course and
this is just a really nice warm
outerwear piece with this turquoise and
purple and navy snake print on it
inside I'm wearing the matching sports
bra top so it's really flattering in
this dark color it's just very secure
it's just a really nice shape and it's
got this I think it's like a would you
call that a fish-scale print or like a
snake print
I don't know but really really like this
and then the bottoms I actually went for
a different design on the bottoms just
to add a bit of variety to be honest
I'll probably mix and match so I may not
wear the two together all the time I
feel like they're a little bit maybe too
bold
together but this with black trousers or
like a great top and these bottoms will
look really cool the bottoms the print
reminds me of I don't know some kind of
Indian not sure how to describe it but
it's really cool it's got like little
zebra patterns this is almost Aboriginal
just really really cool bright colors so
I think when I go to Malaysia as well
I'll probably take this with me as my
holiday workout gear it's so so colorful
and I think I'm gonna be wearing this
cardigan a lot it's double layered so
it's a really really lovely warm piece
but as you can see there's a bit of
netting in there so it's nice and
breathable so really well-designed and
beautiful so exactly what I need in a
nice gym outfit so that's what I'm
currently wearing and yeah we're going
to go to the gym and then we're gonna go
to carbon common and maybe do like an
outdoor workout to take Dexter for a
walk so that's next on the card before
we go out I'm dying to open up this box
which arrived yesterday and because it's
been sitting on my bed ever since it
arrived so I'm gonna open it up with you
guys now so this box has come all the
way from America at least I'm hoping
what's inside is what I think is inside
because well let me just open it and
then I will explain the whole process
it's a really really cool process
is what I thought was in the parcel and
it is my USA shopping hall and as you
guys probably know I have not been to
America in a long time but that doesn't
stop me from lusting over American
beauty products and things from the
other side of the pond from retailers
like revolve I keep seeing it all it's
instant and wanting to get some that
getting put off by the shipping treaties
and so I actually heard about this
company who act as a pure box almost in
America and that locker is your address
in America and you basically send things
from American retailers to that locker
so it's kind of like normal online
shopping and then everything goes to
your American address and then the
company called go send they then post
everything to you in the UK so you save
a load of faffing around with customs
and be 80 and excruciating mihai
shipping costs and it's just a really
really easy process so i used go send to
make a bit of an american shopping haul
and so i thought i would show you what i
picked up so everything came all
perfectly wrapped up in this box nice
and secure and then it came to me via
DHL so i didn't have any problems with
receiving the goodies from America and
then I've picked up some bits from
Victoria's Secret I got a bikini from
there I absolutely love Victoria Secret
bikinis but I just can never deal with
their shipping process so amazing now I
was able to get a bikini and then I
think this one this is Kate Spade I
think I got that from revolve actually
or maybe as Neiman Marcus let me have a
look at this as my receipt mmm no I
don't think it says but I'm sure it was
either like Neiman Marcus or Macy's or
something and then here I have got some
beauty products these as I'm sure you
can guess are from Sephora and then I
also shopped from revolve I picked up
this portable phone charger because it's
literally the handiest thing in the
world so I'm going to open everything up
and then I can show you guys properly so
here are all my amazing pieces I am so
so chuffed with my little us haul I will
show you all the different bits and bobs
I picked up so I'll start with Sephora
the first thing that I got is they
absolutely stunning a makeup brush set
and this is the Mara Hoffman for Sephora
limited edition brush set hopefully it
will still be available in the shops
I'll try and link everything down below
as always just against you fancied
shopping I'll also leave information
about these guys in case you guys want
to pick up anything from America as well
such an easy process so highly recommend
using go stand and these are just the
most pre useful brushes you've got a
couple of base brushes you could use
this for blush powder for contour and
then this could be a really amazing
blending brush and eyeshadow brush all
with these rose gold tips and it's
beautiful Mara Hoffman detail down at
the bottom cannot wait to use these
they're just so beautiful and then
you've got Mara Hoffman written in gold
so really really stunning design really
like this box as well I'll definitely
let me throwing this away it's a really
nice little keepsake box also from
Sephora yes I managed to pick up the
very exclusive Anastasia Beverly Hills
glow kit I've been wanting this for so
long and of course I don't believe
there's anywhere in the UK that you can
pick it up just go out the box there we
go oh look how beautiful it is all these
actually stunning shades of highlights
they look absolutely ah so gorgeous
cannot wait to wear this so stunning I
actually tried to buy this when we went
to San Francisco and Trek America but
all the sepoys had sold out so I managed
to get it online shipped it to me here
in the UK amazing I'm so so happy that I
got that can't wait to try it
um and then this is the clay palette
from Tarte and I just love Tarte
packaging because beautiful purple
almost like a almost matches my outfit
snakeskin design and then inside ah look
at this can you get more beautiful color
than this you think I'd have enough
palettes but no I just absolutely fell
in love with this one I saw on the
website a huge mirror and the lids are
really good for traveling I've got this
big blush a couple of eyeshadow shades
and then some really really wearable
shades down here as well so just
definitely my cup of tea all these
beautiful neutral Browns going in some
darker shades for building up a nice
smoky eyes I can't wait to try that one
this is the showstopper clay palette
from Tarte
also from Sephora I got a Mara
Kaufmann mirror this is just a compact
handbag mirror I thought this would be
really really handy just if you know
doing your makeup on the go can't get
into at the moment but it's got that
beautiful Mara Hoffman pattern which we
saw on the box I also got a josie maran
a lip balm I've heard really really good
things about these love the packaging
love the name JC what a cool name and
then it's just a vanilla flavor lip balm
and I thought it's so handy for the
autumn months and we need a little bit
more hydration on our lips so that's
gonna be a really good handbag essential
absolutely adore this like hexagonal
rose gold pattern as well so beautiful
and on recommendation of Fleur de force
I picked up the Becker Jaclyn hill
champagne split shimmering shrimp
effector and mineral blush long name so
it's in this gorgeous Becca packaging
and inside you've got a highlight and a
blush chew I thought this would again be
really good for traveling so I love
anything with two products in it and
both shades just so wearable so stunning
I think this shade of blush a little bit
more muted is really nice for autumn so
looking forward to giving that a try so
that's everything I got from Sephora and
then the Kate Spade box was this acrylic
tape dispenser with the rose gold bits
on the end there which says make it
stick and all my office essentials are
acrylic and rose gold so that's going to
go really nicely with the rest of my and
bits and bobs this is going to be so so
handy so this is from the brand called
Sonics which I don't believe we can buy
here in the UK if anyone knows where you
can and let me know so I want more
things from them and this I got from
revolve I really want to shop more from
evolve and I'm definitely gonna be doing
another go send order from evolve now
that I've seen how easy it is and this
is a portable phone charger so as a
blogger I'm on my phone all the time and
I run out of battery over the time and
this I thought was a really really cute
one to keep in my handbag and yeah it's
just browsing revolve and thought you
know what I've got my go son locker set
up so why not add this to my basket it's
just so easy to shop from from multiple
retailers I thought why the heck not and
finally here is my Victoria's Secret
bikini and this neon pink one which will
look so nice with a tan
and it's got this crochet design around
it which is really in trend in fashion
at the moment so I'm going to give this
one a try and hopefully you'll see me
wearing this in Malaysia and go send
have kindly put in this little gift set
as well so I think it looks like a bunny
Yas lip balm in there or don't if it is
actually us but it looks the same as
yours packaging a little mini bite
lipstick a perfume what's at h2o youth
serum and a little mini Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer so that's a really nice
little addition to my haul as well thank
you goes and so that is my us shopping
hauls so please with all those pieces
and yeah really really good service so I
will leave all the information about go
send down the description box if you
wanted to treat yourself to a u.s.
shopping haul just like I've done now I
think Charlie's just shavings oh he'll
probably be a few more minutes I'm gonna
go and list this mattress on gong
shrieks has been taking at this bedroom
so long and I'm just getting annoyed
with having it in the background on my
videos so I'm gonna go and list that on
gumtree both hold on that hopefully try
to be ready to go because Dexter cute
the whining the Sun is coming out now
and it's looking so beautiful outside
it's so let's get going
okay back from walk and looking a little
bit more glamorous since last time you
saw me so I've had a nice shower wash my
hair about how to do it really really
delicately because I cannot get my
eyebrows wet so yeah that was quite
challenging
this one looks so much darker than this
one now wonder why that is
um so yeah as you might guess by the
face and the 9th chopped I'm going to do
a little bit of filming I find that
weekend's are so much better for filming
because I don't get distracted by
hundreds of emails coming in so I can
just concentrate on filming and not
worry about anything else although the
weather is not in my favorites day it's
just gone all grey so I'm gonna have to
hope that my ring light is gonna give me
enough lighting and as you might be able
to guess by all these big boxes around
me I'm gonna be filming my beauty advent
calendars part two so yeah you guys seem
to really like the first one and since
then I've got loads more calendars I
will give you a little sneak peek I've
got the look fantastic one sanctuary
ASOS Marks &amp;amp; Spencer molten Brown so a
few more really nice ones I'm going to
open up and share with you guys and also
in this video I'm going to announce a
huge giveaway so this video hopefully
you'll go live around Thursday or Friday
so definitely make sure you watch it if
you want to be in with a chance of
winning a ton of beauty products so yeah
I'm gonna get filming and I'll catch you
guys in about an hour's time
that was an epic fail I feel like I came
across so weirdly in that video
I'm just not feeling 100% I don't know
what it is maybe sat in front of the
fire I've got the fire on and then
having the light on I don't know I think
I just felt really lightheaded while I
was filming that and I just felt that
everything that I said was a load of
rubbish like I couldn't even find the
words to describe the product and I said
the same thing over and over again
so if you've watched that video then I
apologize that it's just really weird
I knew loads of youtubers wouldn't be
like oh I'm not going to put it up if
it's not good enough
but during October I have so much to
film that I just can't film it again and
I always feel like they're never as good
the second time around so yeah I have a
watch maybe it's me just being crazy but
I don't know I don't think I'm gonna be
happy with how that turned out it's
really annoying but yeah I was gonna
fill in a whole video because I've
picked up tons and tons of pieces from
River Island and Miss Selfridge recently
but I think because that video just went
so badly I'm just gonna spend the rest
of the afternoon doing some editing
sorry by my washing in the background
usual weekend chores I'm gonna spend the
rest the afternoon editing and maybe
looking at some summer or winter Sun a
holiday options Charlie and I trying to
get something booked into January so
maybe I'll make my selfie a little bit
better by looking at some holiday
destinations now I have to tidy up this
mess this is always like my least
favorite thing about a day or afternoon
spent filming is the mass but um yeah
I'm gonna put the beauty event condos up
in the loft until Christmas because they
are huge and they take up so much room
so I think I'm gonna put them up in the
loft and yeah I'm gonna crack on with
some work okay I can multi because as
you can probably tell I'm a little bit
stressed out because that video it's
gonna be really bad
so yeah I'll capture with you guys in a
little bit okay so I have set up camp
before the rest of the afternoon you can
treat our it's so gloomy outside it's
just one of those afternoons I want to
be snuggled up at home and not do
anything else so I've got my laptop in
front of me I'm wearing at my comfy
clothes mine
fleecy jumper and tracksuit bottoms and
I'm probably just gonna do a little bit
of work I've got my cup of pucker love
tea which is rose Kalmar and lavender so
hopefully they'll lift my spirits a
little bit and then I've also got an
afternoon snack this is a nine bar I got
addicted to these after I tried one at
the till point at Waitrose a few weeks
ago
and now I'm just totally obsessed with
them I think if I wasn't trying to be
healthier I would definitely have stuck
on a bowl of super noodles or something
but I'm trying my hardest not to binge
on crap food so oh and I would bow
someone's come to join me hello Amy what
have you got to save yourself sausage
yes I'm gonna just snuggle up here for
the next few hours get a little bit of
work done then maybe I will cook some
nice comfort food later I did order the
ingredients for like a buck week with
buck wheat risotto so maybe that's on
the cards for dinner tonight
this is Dexter's current position
yes I'm talking about you what you doing
chest
alrighty it is seven o'clock so I'm
getting hungry
I was a bit naughty and I snapped a
little bit earlier have two of my energy
balls and also I'm going to show you one
of my naughty treats so I'm pretty sure
this is technically baby food as in like
designed for two-year-olds but I'm
obsessed with these so they are Heinz
Hello Kitty pasta shapes I have eaten
these as like my comfort food ever since
I was like four years old and now no
matter how old I get I will not stop
eating them they're just like pasta
shapes in tomato ketchup obsessed with
them so I had worn a bed is like an hour
ago
and Charlie told me off except at me
it's just no sugar so I'm now going to
make a Madeline Shore recipe she very
kindly sent me her first book because as
you guys know I'm obsessed with her
second one which is this one and it's
got like a million post-it notes in it
and I not got her first one so she
really kindly sent it to me they look
almost identical and this one's called
get the glow and in this there is a
recipe for a buckwheat risotto so
because it's I think it's buckwheat and
that you know in a second is that's
wrong but yeah because it is not normal
risotto rice it's much much healthier
that's gluten-free not that I'm gluten
intolerant but you know it's better to
be patient or you can I'm still gonna
put a
the parmesan in there because I do want
it to be tasty but yeah I'm going to
start cooking that in a second before I
do I just wanted to say something I was
just going through my inbox and a few of
you guys have very kindly got in touch
with me saying that maybe you're
starting a blog or you want some tips on

it's been snowing on mine cuz I bet it's
so much Parmesan cheese on top of it
Charlie behind me is trying to get an
Instagram photo of him or a snapchat of
his with the salmon on it leave a
comment down below if you would rather
have my risotto with the Parmesan cheese
all over it
