vlogmas day 17 I think we're on day 17
by now although we've missed a few but
you know only human these things happen
so I hope you guys don't mind that I
have missed out a couple but as I said
at the beginning I wasn't gonna stress
too much if I didn't manage to vlog
every single day and you guys are all
wonderful in forgiving so thank you for
bearing with me and but I'm in the UK
now over the rest of the year so
normality it should resume hopefully so
I'm gonna try and be a bit more on it
with my daily vlogs especially as we get
so close to Christmas today my mum's
over she's just bought Dexter back
because she was looking after him while
we were in Sweden and we have a lion
actually I've been getting really
sluggish recently so didn't get out of
bed until about 9 o'clock which for me
it's just absolutely crazy and then yeah
mum got here and we drove down to dawdle
and picked up some more blogger mail
there's quite a lot for Charlie today so
I might do a his-and-hers blogger mail
and boxing for you guys shortly this is
what we've got to deal with today quite
a lot but I was just about to start
making some of my healthy Beauty but our
bites I like to call them and I thought
I would vlog it in case you didn't see
the video I did with Madelyn short it's
very very similar to what I made with
her but yeah just thought I'd show you
how I make these bites because they're
so nice to just keep in the fridge
they're so tasty and they last like two
or three weeks in a Tupperware container
if you don't eat them by then that is um
and it's just so easy so healthy so
filling so let me show you how I do it
so the main ingredient is medjool dates
I just got these Tesco organic ones and
Lala has kindly dee stoned them we're
gonna use about I'd say maybe 400 grams
of these as the main ingredient and
these really help to make the bars
sticky so you do need the dates because
that's what kind of binds the other
ingredients all together and then I've
put in once again around 400 grams of
almonds these are just again like Tesco
basics you really don't need to get
anything too snazzy
I'm also going to be shoving in a few
hazelnuts maybe just a handful of these
you can really put in whatever nuts and
seeds you want you can put in some
flaked almonds but I'm actually not
going to today
you can put in some walnut kernels or
even better if you've got one of the
ones that look like walnuts oh my god my
mind's gone blank yeah you know the ones
that means pecan nuts yeah if you've got
pica nuts I actually prefer them statio
kernels and then this is our like
healthy food cupboard I'm probably gonna
put in see some chia seeds just for a
bit of another health benefit no I might
even put in some super elixir because
why not and then this is my favorite bit
when they're done I like to put some
goji berries on the top just to add a
little bit of a different texture so
that it's not all just a gooey bar and
these ones I got from Whole Foods a
little while ago so yeah gonna put some
dates in and also to make them
chocolatey I've got this green superfood
cacao powder and this one I got from
Amazon if I remember I'll leave the link
down below because this one is basically
cacao but just it's got a few additional
ingredients in it which make it a little
bit better for you so I'll probably end
up putting around 3 tablespoons of that
in mixing it all up and that's about it
really
oh and almond butter I forgot about that
this one's coconut and almond but pure
almond is probably a little bit better I
think up in around 3 tablespoons of this
so as you can tell it's a little bit of
a rough art you don't really need any
precise measurements you don't need any
particular ingredients as long as you've
got like the dates the cacao and
probably I would say the almonds the
rest of it you can just shove in
whatever you've got in the house that's
my kind of typical ingredient list very
rough measurements to be honest I don't
weigh anything that was just to give you
guys an approximate idea so they need to
stick it all in your blender and then
you just stick it all in your blender
mine is the Thermomix which I swear by
that's so good they're really powerful
and you can adjust the speeds so it
means that I can put my speed down a
little bit so I still get that nice
crunch which I just love I don't like it
to be all completely blended and pureed
and this as easy as that really so let's
get blending
so once you have blended everything it
should look like this I don't recommend
putting in quite as many ingredients as
I did I might go a little bit overboard
and then just kind of feel the texture
see how it feels
mine feels a little bit dry so I'm gonna
do excuse the copy machine in the back
making very not insert so what I'm gonna
do to make mine a little bit less dry is
add some coconut oil this is the organic
virgin coconut oil from Neal's Yard
remedies I didn't actually realize until
quite recently that they did supplements
so I'm gonna put in about two
tablespoons of coconut oil and then we
should be good to go
so because mine was rather overfilled
it's going to be quite nutty you can see
that the almonds haven't really broken
up there's still some quite big chunks
in there but I don't mind that don't
want a bit of crunch so now I'm going to
get it all out and I'm going to pop it
and then put a sheet of greaseproof
paper on this which is probably my
deepest baking tray and then just smooth
it all out to make it flat
this is what it looks like at the moment
all squid into my tray and for the
pistol is his thoughts I'm going to add
some of my goji berries onto the top
which will make it a little bit more
colorful and a little bit more tasting
okey-dokey now Charlie now you're gonna
open up our dojo blogger mail so I think
I'm gonna do the same as I did last time
and put you all on a tripod because then
you'll actually be RCS I'm gonna film it
in our other bedrooms in the one that we
actually sleep in cuz that room is a bit
to the tip so let's bring you in here

in the envelope so I'm gonna be reusing
those my Christmas packaging oh that is
beautiful so you've got this little
blush and then I'm not sure what this
top bit is it says sparkle illuminator
so maybe you just put a few drops of
this in your foundation or I guess you
could like put a few dots on the
cheekbone area to highlight but that's a
really lovely little set Charlie has
finally gone so we have a bit more
normality in here
next I'm gonna open up this big black
one I'm not too sure what's in here Oh

personalized I just adore lovely next is
this beautiful delivery from Birchbox
it's so beautifully presented you've got
this kind of like craft box with a
hohoho on little tag and then you've got
some leaves
some kind of first party season means
dinner parties cocktail ketchups and one
too many all-nighters either way it's
important to revive and restore the
festive season and these pampering posts
will help you to do just that
after all you deserve it so I'm guessing
these orbits that are available on
Birchbox calm because you can buy beach
products on that as well as their boxes
this is a duo may don't know how to
pronounce that pure spring water which
actually my skin pretty dry today
gorgeous and then also a fabulous
hi I'm Hydra Lou I was thinking about
this and talking about this Hydra neuron
moisture boosting mask again I'm gonna
use that tonight and then all Bay dry
texturizing spray I don't know if I've
heard this one before
my hair as you can tell has not been
touched since I got out the shower so
probably not a good time to try out new
hair product but handy travel sized
little hair spray and then this I think
might be the quarterly yes
cordially divine oil so you can put this
on your body on your hair on your face
it's just such a lovely oh you got wet
really here we outside or did you we
inside
naughty boy I hope he's just been
outside yeah really lovely multitasking
oil from quarterly and I think that's
everything so lovely little box of
pampering gifts from Birchbox oh and
some little hair bubbles good so this is
from a hotel the Milan I stayed up two
years ago now two years ago now yeah
over a year ago
it smells good they sent a candle lafay
is a hotel that Lola and I stayed at on
Lake Garda in Italy we went there last
September and it's very much like a
wellness hotel you can study Chinese
medicine you can do yoga they have this
amazing Discovery Program and they very
kindly sent me a festive festive candle
which smells like a hotel smells
actually really smells like hotel rooms
so I'm going to leave my blog post about
the Fae down below because it's a really
really cool place and if you like
wellness retreats then I'm sure you'll
like it so thank you very much
lafha for a lovely gift gorgeous oh my
gosh
this next one is from Liz Earle and it's
this beautiful box and not shorts inside
let's have a little look look at this
beautiful bow or is I don't need to take
it off if I don't need to oh it's so
beautiful oh my gosh so this is super
skin treatment oil and super skin
concentrate for the face and then what
looks like a very rude massager I mean
I'm guessing you're meant to massage
your face with this but it's quite not
much so I guess you're meant to put the
serum on your face and then massage it
in with this you could use this all over
on the back and Oh super skin treatment
oil for body okay so you are meant to
massage
so you're not meant to use this on your
face like clunker if you're interested
but on the body instead which is
actually really lovely because I'm still
doing it um because it helps get
everything moving in the body if you
massage it in and most of us just stick
our body cream on and we're done but if
you massage it in then you get much more
benefit from it so guess who's gonna be
having a pamper night tonight apply our
oil upwards from the ankle to thighs
using a push-pull movement for mcclure
with your fingers and use a rake like
movement to massage up and down and then
use cat paws to need from the ankle
upwards finished by using the rolling
tool up and down the calves bottom
thighs and bottom to massage the muscles
what else what else so we have a little
something from L'Oreal Pavley oh this is

few more bits in the other room but I'm
not gonna open those because I think
I've been doing this quite a long time I
feel like this is a little bit shuffled
it compared to the last time I did blog
a mail due to a certain someone so maybe
I'll leap in our next time so I'm gonna
wrap up the blogger mail and I'll see
you okay blogger mail unboxing done I'm
sorry that was stressful to watch as it
was to participating but yes we're not
gonna get the boys involved next time
cuz Dexter and Charlie just made a
little bit too stressful for my liking
and that now has and I mums just gone
and Charlie and I are going to do some
Christmas wrapping we've just put on
Notting Hill Christmas movie and I'm
just now scurrying around the house
trying to remember where I've hidden
everyone's presents I know that I've put
one of mums on top of the Wardrobe mum
if you're watching stop watching now you
don't need to see the rest of this video
just purge it off
so mums presents one of them I've hidden
up in the wardrobe uh hey what's this
presents why hidden up in here so I'm
gonna go and scurry around the house and
find every prezi's and then we're gonna
watch a film
sit downstairs do some rapping and have
a nice a festive afternoon
okay so I've got my little wrapping
station set up I've just been eating my
oven pounder got our candle burning and
it smells so amazing oh my gosh the
whole room smells so festive my tea and
I've got my tea and my mug from girls
that sent it to me earlier so wrapping
paper is over there somewhere and then I
ordered load of things from Amazon so
I've got some string because it's always
looks lovely and festive and then a
couple of really nice ribbons I've got
this gold thick ribbon which I think
looks really nice and then this is a
more kind of like natural calico ribbon
got some festive red and white string
and then this is a stamp to make little
snowflake holes in the gift cards we've
got a puppy helping us and I got some
hohoho Merry Christmas stamps as well
Dexter's having his happen Calendar
hurry up daddy I don't have all day you
know hurry up daddy I really don't have
all day just sorry the people on the
video night this is dark chocolate dog
juggling for really
this is what I do you see I stand up but
I don't bother using my back legs so
there's no stretch out on the floor
while my body is up here what do you
have to say for yourself chicken legs no
I'd stood up like a big boy Christmas
wrapping is all done that's a good job
out the way and we watched the whole of
Notting Hill while we were rapping so we
had a nice festive afternoon we've
decided that we're going to go to the
cinema now because we still haven't seen
fantastic beasts and is on at 5:40 it's
so dark you'd think it was like 10
o'clock so we're gonna head there now
Charlie and I just can't go to like
eight or nine o'clock showings anymore
because we end up or I end up falling
asleep during the film I don't know what
is wrong with my energy levels these
days but I cannot really stay awake much
beyond 11:00 and I get so tired after
like 8:00 p.m. so a 5:40 showing is
outside you're perfect
I've just had a really naughty like you
know those Chicago town microwave pizzas
and so good just had one of those so
hopefully I won't be too hungry in the
cinema so I'm gonna put some normal
clothes on so I'm wearing my leggings
all day while at home although I might
just wear these to the cinema it's a bit
weird don't have gonna wear them so yeah
it's gonna be sad leaving our little boy
at home but I'm excited to see the film
yes the context that he knows is that a
sausage dog on the TV yes so back from
the cinema now film is really really
good I only fell asleep once and it's
really good for me it was quite scary is
that right um so yeah we are home now
with our little chat oh look at it and
we're just gonna watch a Christmas film
it's called Christmas with the Coopers
and it's got sausage dogs in it we've
got a roast duck in the oven and a
crispy duck so nice chilled Saturday
evening hello youtube hello
sign up and follow my instagram and
index to the dachshund get on your
important
Perceval Ilyich
so here we are again in my bathroom I'm
going to do a face mask tonight I think
Charlie's going to do the same one and
it's one of the glam glow once I got my
blogger mail today this one is the
thirsty mud hydrating treatment and I'm
going to use the brush that came with as
well because I feel like my skin's a
little bit dry after the flight and I
don't know I just don't feel like I
really kept up with my skin care very
well when I was in Sweden so hopefully
this will add a little bit of
nourishment left quite like the idea of
doing it with a brush as well oh my gosh
it smells really coconutty
it smells really nice actually I don't
know if I smell is coconut or honey so I
was expecting this to be a mud mask
because that's what all glam glow masks
that I've tried in the past are but
obviously as it's a nourishing hydrating
one it's more of a gel formula kind of
like the honey Gill and one that I
really really like so I'm gonna leave
this on for like 10-15 minutes already I
can kind of feel it tingling which
doesn't normally happen to my skin with
a nourishing mask so hopefully it's got
a few extra ingredients in there and
then I'll just take it off with a nice
warm flannel and hopefully my skin will
have picked up a little bit of goodness
from it because yeah it's feeling a
little bit part recently so I'm gonna
end the vlog here because I'm just gonna
take the mask off and go to bed I think
we're going to try and watch something
on Netflix not terribly exciting but
yeah hope you guys enjoyed today's
vlogmas tomorrow don't really want them
doing tomorrow probably even though it's
Sunday gonna do quite a lot of work so I
will try and make that fun if possible
then it might just be another non
glamorous working day but I want to try
and get all my work done before
Christmas so yeah hope you enjoyed
today's one if you do then give it a
thumbs up and I'll see you racing bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
