my last daily chatty vlog for everyday
May I think it's probably gonna be the
last because I have a few other
different style videos to share with you
before the end of the month so today is
the last kind of follow me round video I
have got a few exciting updates for you
I wanted to vlog yesterday but it turned
into such a busy day and I filmed a few
clips here and there but not enough to
film a vlog so I'm just gonna update you
now basically I now have a brace I'm not
wearing it now because I just took it
out to have a cup of tea because you're
not meant to drink hot drinks while
you're wearing it but basically as you
probably know I've been going through a
process with a company called your smile
direct and it's basically clear braces
but you do the most of the treatments
yourself at home so you make your own
molds you send it off to this company
they make the clear braces and then they
send it back to you however when I sent
my molds back it looked like there was
too much overcrowding on my bottom teeth
so yesterday I had to go to a clinic
called Gardens Square Dental I think it
was called in Kensington and it was
really really nice I want to see surgery
but the most right word practice is
really really nice practice I think it
was a private practice and I had to have
my teeth shaved down I had a lady called
Sophie and she was fantastic explained
everything so thoroughly through to me
made me feel really like aware of what
was happening and that it wasn't gonna
hurt so that was amazing and yeah I had
my teeth shaved down and then she gave
me and thun thun my clear braces which I
have been wearing pretty much the whole
time ever since I have to wear them for
about 21 hours of every 24 so I take
them out for a pretty take them out for
meetings and obviously when I'm eating
because you can't eat with men I'll put
them in now so you can see like how I
talk with them but yeah I just wanted to
let you guys know how that was an update
so I am now the proud wearer of clear
braces but before I put them in again
because I can't talk with that well yet
I still have got a bit of a list I
thought I would tell you what I'm doing
for the rest of the day so I'm about to
leave now to go to Selfridges I'm going
to restaurant on the roof with the girls
from benefit so that should be really
really exciting they've got a new range
of brow products that I can't wait to
hear all about and then oh this is
exciting so Charlie and I obviously
we've been going on lots of lovely sunny
trips but I'm very Pro safe tanning and
not damaging your skin so actually we're
going to a place called the mole clinic
and we're getting our moles scammed so
I'll share it all with you later
but that's why I'm not wearing any
makeup because they're just gonna take
it off as soon as I get there anyway
done my brows though can't meet benefit
without doing your brows and so that's
the plan I'm gonna put the braces in now
they literally just like these little
clear plastic things clipping in see I
could just get it over just wearing the
bottom ones you can't really tell him
wearing anything I think maybe when I'm
doing Trek America I might just wear the
bottom ones because I'm gonna be
flogging the whole time and I wasn't
teeth my top teeth don't really need to
move that much anyway oh this is me with
my braces in it's not that obvious
obviously I could have another Lisp
and I'm a bit like nips really feel like
they're covering my teeth like I'm
really conscious of it but I've only
been wearing them for less than a day so
I think I will get used to it let me
know what you guys think I'll leave all
the information for the treatments down
below because so far I'm really
impressed so anyway let me go
so I'm back in Gotham now laughter
gunshot a really really nice lunch with
a man from benefit up on the rooftop of
sandwiches but yeah backing track from
now we didn't get our mole checked on
annoyingly because I was about 10
minutes laying there so they couldn't
listen so really really annoying
I'm just waiting outside the butchers
now choice is getting some meat or oh my
god oh my gosh
so cute
yes choice just going to meet we're
having a barbecue later and then I'm
gonna head home and try to be really
really productive but first let's see
what Shari is chosen from the questions
okay so we're at home now and I've spent
the past I don't know why I always do
things in my arms I feel like I need
more in the frame than just my head and
shoulders yes we're at home now I've
just spent the past I'd say two hours
doing things on my to-do list like
writing emails and I was actually doing
a bit of invoice chasing not the funnest
part of the job that has to be done um
and yeah everything just takes so long I
thought I'd be able to do all of that
and edit two videos in half a time
so the afternoon just run away with me
I'm not sure if you can see but on my
spot I actually have like Wendy's clear
and therefore my brand let me just go
and show you so I'm not going to
remember all the details here they are
so it's a brand called skinned Iceland
and they're their blemish dots with
salicylic acid so I've just put those on
my spots and hopefully oh gosh throw
more around hopefully it will get rid of
them within a few hours I have had this
pesky one for a few days now and singing
something going make it free quite a lot
so I've got a bit of tan and with my
eyelashes I just want to be able to wear
no makeup and so yeah once this flight
is gone but it's really good this little
spot you can't me see it at all I have
got this little clear thing on it guys I
think I'm officially the worst of lager
ever I really have got out in the swing
of doing proper everyday vlogging and
it's honestly really really showing I
think the last time I picked up the
camera was when I was trying on my
origins face mask but then I started to
snapchat it because I normally do my
first impressions on snapchat but it was
really really lovely it was very
satisfying peeling it all off and I
could see all the crap for my paws on
the on the goo that I pulled off that
was really really very satisfying really
like that mask and then I got into like
an obsessive tidying mode so when I
starts tidy not only do I tidy like the
stuff that was meant to tidy but then I
go a little bit overboard as well so I
started to clear on my wardrobe put all
my winter stuff in the loft and you guys
have probably seen in the background how
messy my blogging room normally is or
have a look at this you can actually see
the floor
I am very very very pleased so yeah I
tidied this room because Rory and Nathan
are friends and that now live in Hong
Kong are coming over tonight I think I
mentioned that already family sunglasses
whilst hiding as well there river island
but they look like Dior 300 pounds your
pair Charlie just made me a pins
so I'm now slurping on that while I
finish the final bits of tidying you
guys have no idea how much of a load is
off my mind till finished tidying I
don't know about other bloggers but I
just seem to accumulate so much stuff
like whether it's stuff that I for stuff
that I can't even sent or like clothes
I'm about to shoot if it seems to always
be so much stuff and I'm such a hoarder
I never can bring myself to throw it
away so had a massive massive key route
and I'm feeling very good about it what
else do I need to tell you um I don't
think anything certainly go downstairs
help Charlie prepare some food and wait
for Ori and Nathan to arrive
just got to Woking try you to sit in the
car kissing him we're gonna put the roof
down actually because it's such a nice
day we've got about a three-hour drive
now to Lincoln said goodbye to Rory I've
left him in the housing structures him
how to close the doors and lock
everything up so yeah Rory and Nathan
are staying in our house for a little
bit and we're now driving up to Lincoln
to surprise my granddad cause it's his
90th birthday today and that's a few
days ago but yeah so long journey here
we go we've been driving for a couple of
hours now and we just stopped off to let
Dexter go for a little walk we found a
really nice huge field and he's
frolicking through the grass beginning I
feel like Dexter feels like it belongs
in the countryside I love that you can't
see where he is you can just see the
grass moving I love it in the fields
about two hours ago
yeah then he really figures it out come
on what do you know I didn't but he did
you're my sidekick Oh
we have finally got to Lincoln our car
journey was about six hours because if
you've got stuck in all the bank holiday
traffic but we're finally here
so we're staying the night tonight and
tomorrow night in the Ivy pub in a
little village called rag B because this
is where my so it's my granddad's
daughter but not my full auntie one of
my relatives are in this place and it's
my granddad's 90th birthday tomorrow so
what we'll have a bit of a surprise
party no little one
Dexter needs to go outside for a week so
I'm gonna wrap this look up hey come
here sausage little always are very
needy um so yeah I hope this hasn't been
such a world's most boring vlog I feel
like I haven't really done very much but
yeah I guess my life isn't always that
exciting and every day may I guess is a
good opportunity I see the normal things
that I get up to as well so a nice
family weekend being one of them and I
have to say I have found everyday may
really really hard
I guess because I've been a little bit
poorly and I've been traveling so many
places around had terribly good Wi-Fi
even now I've tried to avoid a video got
in and it's like 1% that video is
definitely not going to going up whereas
I think when I did vlogmas I was at home
most of the time so had reliable Wi-Fi
and I have enjoyed doing it hopefully
guys have enjoyed these videos I am
gonna film a couple more when I get back
home but for now I'm going to enjoy the
weekend in Lincoln without vlogging and
without doing any work so I'm gonna log
out and I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
