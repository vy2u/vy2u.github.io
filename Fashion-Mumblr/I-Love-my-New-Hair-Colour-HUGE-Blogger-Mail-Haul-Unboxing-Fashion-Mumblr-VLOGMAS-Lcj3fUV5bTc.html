12 quite possibly not sure what my day
is losing track so there wasn't a blog
yesterday because yesterday Charlie and
I which is working from home all day and
it would have been terribly boring for
you guys
Wow Charlie and I are getting excited
over a really cool pram and so yeah this
morning we've dispensed the gym we took
some photos to your vlog did we darling
yes and now I'm off to the hairdresser's
so I canceled everything else from my
diary today because when I get my hair
colored it can often take up to like
five hours and I'm getting a full head
of color today getting a spruce up ahead
of Christmas so I thought I would take
you to the salon and show you exactly
what I get done because you ask a lot of
questions about my hair so I thought
instead of telling you I'll show you
so I'm finally back home and I was
probably in the hairdresser's for about
five even 1/2 hours but I'm ashamed to
say that's not even a longest hair
appointment that I've ever had I've
definitely had longer ones before but I
think it was worth it I'm pretty sure
this is the best my hair color has ever
been and it's definitely the my favorite
color that I've ever had my hair the
reason why it took so long is because
first of all we did a full head of
blonde highlights and obviously I've got
quite a lot of hair it may be quite fine
but I do have a lot so a full head of
highlights does take a long time and
then we did a bleach bath so that was
actually to get rid of the tone that it
was before because it was just a little
bit too orangey and warm for my liking
so we did the bleach bath mostly on the
ends to get rid of that tone and make it
a lot kind of cooler and then because
blond hair needs all the love and
nourishment that it can get we then did
olaplex in its two stages so I had OPEX
one on for 15 minutes and then olaplex -
after shampoo and conditioning and if
you don't do some real nourishing
treatments - blonde hair after it gets
colored it's just so dry but my hair
looks and feels in really good condition
now and then we did a shampoo and
condition and then use some pure ology
products just all over to help comb it
through so it took a very long time but
I think we got the results that I was
hoping for in the end absolutely love
how its come out so back home again
now I'm gonna have a very quick bowl of
tomato soup because I haven't eaten
anything since my breakfast smoothie
this morning feeling a little bit faint
not gonna lie and then we're going to go
down to dawdle and pick up a huge load
of blogger mail it's been about five or
six days and so what last went down this
is probably getting quite a lot then
I've got two videos to film then we've
got a pack of Sweden
okay so just got back home from
doddle as you saw from that little clip
in the store I have quite a lot of
things to show you so it's gonna be
quite as fun blogger mail unboxing you
know apologize right now if this has
suddenly turned into a half hour long
video it's not longer and because I
actually have things from Topshop things
from ASOS as well as my usual blogger
mail so I'm going to do a bit of a haul
slash blogger mail and boxing for you
I'm going to put my camera on a tripod
because I mean the mess is quite real
right now and blogger mail can get
incredibly untidy because I just fling
packaging all over the place but I
actually last time I did this I got
quite a lot of questions about doddle
and why I keep talking about this random
dawdle place so I thought I would let
you know what it is so I as a blogger
you guys know the troll blockers do get
sent quite a lot of things and for that
reason I needed somewhere that was a
little bit like a peer box that could
look after or collect my mail for me
because as with a lot of people I don't
spend all day every day at home so I'm
not often there to receive my deliveries
so what doddle does is it's basically
like a shop front mine is across the
road from Brixton stations but there are
dawdles all over the country and often
they are in really convenient places so
very more likely than not they're in
train stations or very close to train
stations so you can get your mail
delivered there instead of to your house
and the past solicitors they like to
call them will sign for it let you know
when something arrives for you and then
they'll send you an email you go in with
the email your ID and collect your mail
so it's really really easy a lot of
retailers do it for free and also you
can do free returns from there so for
example ASOS shoe holux which is the
Kirk I get discount or Outlet Store
DeRosa ASOS already yeah probably
net-a-porter so many stores do amazing
service with Dajjal and even stores that
use my Hermes
a returns policy like Topshop my nearest
my homies returns place is like a half
hour walk away and so it's just amazing
that I can actually do that through
dawdle so basically an amazing service
if you're a blogger then I highly
recommend signing up they are my life
saviors I actually have my own little
VIP section in the back of the store
because they said on their best customer
which is just hilarious and even if
you're not a blogger if you get anything
and delivered to your house and you're
not gonna be there then that's going to
cause an issue so if you just set up a
doddle account then you can get
everything delivered there and once you
sign up you can just use that as your
delivery address so I highly recommend
it and yeah so this is what I've picked
up in today's Dajjal haul so I'm gonna
put you down the tripod and get stuck in
also do not just shut that drawer before
I went up the room okay keep an eye on
it just opens by itself anyway let's get
started with blogger mail so and I'm
gonna start with this ginormous gold one
sorry if I keep looking above the camera
by the way it's because I can see myself
up there instead of down below where I
normally is and okay so this is a big
gold box and it's
with love from Cote and Cote are the
parent company of brands like a schwa
Rimmel Marc Jacobs fragrances and loads
of other brands so OPI nail varnishes
and I work with them quite a lot so it
looks like they sent a little something
for Christmas so let's have a little
look what's in here I'm doing the bow
okay so let's have a look what's inside
time dun dun oh my goodness okay so this
is a delivery it's specifically from
Marc Jacobs so we have Marc Jacobs
shining edition Oh de Toilette spray and
then Marc Jacobs decadence one 8k
edition Oh de Parfum and also a little
Marc Jacobs bauble which has the Marc
Jacobs dream fragrance insider how
adorable it starts so cute all in this
absolutely amazing box which I'm never
gonna want to throw away
Pawel gorgeous so this is a very
luxurious gift let's hold and look what
this smells like
hi
is that better okay I feel like that's a
little bit better so I've opened up the
Marc Jacobs Daisy shine additional trade
runs let's see I always love looking at
what these bottles look like oh my gosh
that does not disappoint look at that so
you got beautiful gold bottle with the
gold daisies on the lid oh my gosh
that's so nice
Wow okay it's so lovely that does smell
a lot like in fact I think that might be
just a normal market a cat Stacy
fragrance but in a snazzier bottle it's
not too short I'm not familiar enough
with it to tell you if it's the same or
not but it's probably just like a
slightly more luxurious version so thank
you Marc Jacobs Coty my first bit of
below the mail okay next let's move on
to some of the envelopes this has got
C&amp;amp;J maybe Charlie and Josie I don't know
it's not just a coincidence written on
the on the sticker which is so cute
don't know if that sister a major
coincidence maybe the brand is CMJ oh my
god it is that was just a coincidence
how fun is that so this is Katherine and
Jean that's so funny I literally saw
that and throw it was Charlie and Josie
see Katherine and Jean let's have
another look oh my gosh oh I remember
this brand actually contacted me and
asked if I wanted to try one of their
face masks and this is a lavender filled
I mask and I just could think of
anything more perfect for traveling and
it's got little flamingo S on it which
is just adorable got this little silk
silk border but I think that's
absolutely beautiful so this is from
Katherine and Jean calm I will leave a
link down below that's absolutely
gorgeous if you know anyone that travels
a lot then I think that is a really
really lovely Christmas gift so thank
you guys
another parcel and this one says it's
got perfume in it so let's have a little
look at what's inside here we have got
sexy blossom by Michael Kors actually
really surprises me because sexy blossom
doesn't sound like a very Michael cause
name but I do really like Michael Kors
fragrances they actually included their
one the last one in my blog gift guide
which I'll leave links down below that's
got tons of ideas of Christmas gifts if
you still need a little bit of
inspiration and also by the way I just
created a new page on my blog that is
shop my Instagram so if you like any of
the outfits that I feature on my
Instagram you can just go to that page
on my blog and it has all the links so
but I'd let you know about that in case
you are wondering my my Instagram
outfits are from so this is the sexy
blossom fragrance from Michael Kors
really like this packaging actually it's
very small and sleek sticker on your
handbag I can't really sprigs so why not
just have so many fumes in its bedroom
but
Oh oh well it's very sweet very floral
hmm
that's don't need like a springtime
fragrance I feel like it's quite young I
probably wouldn't wear that my socks is
a little bit too sweet but if you do
like sweet fragrances then that is a
very lovely sweet one personally it's a
little bit too sweet for me but let's
see how it settles on the skin because I
don't like to judge fragrances too
quickly
having said what I just said um because
I'm sure it might sound a little bit
different in a few minutes four hours
what did we got next I have no idea
what's in this one
let's just have a little look delivered
by yodel that's a great thing about
dawdle it doesn't matter where it's
coming from it can be like ups or DPD or
yodel they all go to dawdle I have a
parcel within a parcel aha
okay this is a dress from Dorothy
Perkins actually I'm doing a sponsored
Instagram for this dress which basically
means that the brand are running a
campaign around this particular item and
they're paying need to do an Instagram
about it so I'm sure you guys already
know this but a lot of the time the way
the bloggers make that dollar is by
collaborating with brands and brands
will payers to feature certain things so
this is a dress which I'd previously
said I really lights from drives and
Perkins and they were like okay while
we're doing a campaign around it so if
you can get some nice imagery we'll page
on your Instagram which is very kind of
firm and so yeah I'm looking forward to
taking this unit ators to Gothenburg
with me don't equate you even taught you
guys about that we're going to Sweden
tomorrow so yeah I will be taking it
this with me to shoot out that and don't
worry I will of course be taking you
guys to Sweden with us because both
months few Jase you can't wait to see
this dress on you
lots of love Dorothy Perkins right next
we have a silver sparkly package no clue
as to who this is from
I think it's a dolphin
oh my goodness yes okay a load of
products are just falling out of here
let's see
uh-huh okay so this is a collaboration
between dolphin and Curzon and they've
created these little scented sachets
which I guess you could put in like your
wardrobe or your underwear drawer and
slipped into a bag a tool or a suitcase
it says inspired by the sensorial
bouquet of subtle notes of rose lily of
the valley and flora vanilla delicately
wrapped in musk and cedar wood and
softened with notes of sand would sounds
absolutely gorgeous so these are really
beautiful little and gift from the
Browns but a little look
Oh oh my god they smell amazing
I actually really like putting things
like this in my underwear drawer in my
life you're kini basket or in my
suitcase just means your clothes always
smell really lovely and fresh and then
they also put in in troll and mousse
cleanser like some of that and then this
is an environmental lightweight shield I
love things like this I'm going to try
these tonight
I just dar fun as far as luxury skincare
goes I love it I don't think I've ever
tried anything Rudolph and I don't love
it so thank you guys
right next we have this ginormous sing
squeeze bag full of products Dajjal did
actually very kindly give me their own
bags but I thought you know what got the
same speed bags might as well fill them
okay so this is a press release from
Lottie London they actually sent a
massive box full of products which I
opened in the doddle store because it
didn't have enough arms I actually need
to get to the back from dawdle and but I
didn't have enough arms to carry it so I
opened up the box and it was filled with
popcorn which was very fun and exciting
but I couldn't carry boxes popcorn home
so I actually left that for the lovely
staff at dawdle but I did rummage
through the popcorn and there was some
beauty products in that so let's see the
beauty products launching their brand
new color collection to complete your
selfie ready beauty regime so as I go
through this bag they'll probably be
some random lottery london beauty
products in amongst the mix so we'll
have a look and there was also a box
from Kiehl's that I opened up and I
haven't seen what's actually in these
but I might have spotted what it was on
so ances vlog I think it was
yeah I think it was hello October Susie
I think she blocked her kills
decorations so maybe I've got the same
although it's so cute
they've got a little Christmas 2015
photos of some marshmallow cups inside
there it's 2016 and then this one has a
little photo of me from last year as
well okay I think what they've done is
they've gone back to last year's
Christmas on my Instagram and taken some
photos from that which is so sweet and
then they put the photos into these
baubles which is just absolutely
adorable
such a lovely idea and it's got a little
keg on the baubles caifa keels so thank
you kills I'll be popping these on my
tree straight after filming this we have
another large envelope no clue who this
is from
ooh a Veda wow this is already a fab
gift because I absolutely love their
wooden power brushes this is the world's
lightest hairbrush so if you ever get
our make when you're brushing your hair
and like I do
Aveda hair brushes are amazing and it's
a joy Norma's paddle brush so it's just
so good for detangling and yeah my ABS
you love Aveda parish's there
there is more or let's see I've got that
stupid parcel bit wrapped around my
makeup
dear Josephine this boxes in has been
hand-picked with love and created just
for you half the Christmas love a major
oh that is so lovely so let's see what
is inside my evader hand-picked box love
their packaging as well it's so
beautiful oh my god my favorite products
yes okay so we have got the shampoo dry
shampoo this is just such a lovely
lightweight dry shampoo it doesn't like
flag up your hair it just feels so
lovely and lightweight and then they've
put in chakra okay this is a balancing
body mist oh my gosh love the sound that
oh it smells amazing
Aveda if you haven't smelled survey the
products before you need to go and do
that ASAP and then the damage remedy
daily Hair Repair this is so lovely for
putting on damp hair or even dry hair
and just really helps to like seal in
the end so you don't get any spit ends
any dryness so perfect little product
selection from evader so generous of
them excited to top up my hair
collection okay this next one is it says
beauty pie on now I think this might be
a beauty box and you beauty box so let's
have a little look inside and do the
ribbon it's very luxurious looking at
reminds me a little bit of mine a
supporter packaging
okay beautify all your makeup without
the markup okay that sounds good welcome
to beautify okay this is interesting it
actually you ride the looks of it a new
brand this actually sounds pretty
amazing so it says at beauty pie our
mission is to bring our members of the
world's best beauty products at their
totally transparent factory cost
no mama jumbo no markups and no
middleman it's like the buyers club for
beauty addicts Wow okay so I think what
they've done is they've gone to like the
factories where all of our favorite
Beach products are made and instead of
shoving the branding on it they've just
put their own branding on so you don't
have to pay for like Kylie Jenner for
example just written on top of your
lipstick because these are the same kind
of products but direct from the factory
yeah it says our everyday mission is to
go out and source the world's best
beauty products from a global basis
supplies and to bring them to our
members at their transparent factory
cost we don't reinjure near our favorite
cosmetic formulas to fit particular
retail price points we don't pay big
margins to our middlemen are nor we it
will me nor will we remove the
moisturizer for my favorite under eye
makeup to make it meet the budget no
catch oh my gosh this is crazy so I
don't know if you guys know much about
like what goes on behind the scenes of
retail but as you probably know beauty
products have huge markup on them brands
have to pay for things like marketing
advertising product development
packaging those kind of things and all
of those things add up to the retail
price so what your lipstick costs when
you buy it is not what its cost to
produce it there's obviously a huge
market that's gone on top of that so
this is a whole page on cost
transparency but beauty probably
unpacked factory cost of every product
in our collections so the members can
see what we spent and what's been passed
along when then when they buy from
Beauty pie so for example lipstick in
bright red the regular price you would
pay for something like this in the shops
is 20 pounds oh my god
but the transpired factory cost is just
2 pound 29 one-pound 66 of that is
product and packaging
8 pence is safety and testing so they've
obviously split the safety and testing
bill over all the products not just 8
pence of the whole batch 17 pence into
the warehousing and then 38 pence is 382
the tax so actually when you're buying a
20 pound lipstick that has only cost the
brand 2 pound 29 and the rest of it
traditionally is what brand keeps us
profit and spends on marketing so beauty
pie is just not passing on those charges
so we get peach products that are much
better price oh my gosh I bet there's
gonna be so many tubes in here I'm
really excited about this this sounds
amazing so this is a liquid lipstick in
like my favorite shade how gorgeous is
bad can you see
and then this looks a little bit similar
to the Giorgio Armani luminous light
luminous silk foundation so if you're
very intrigued to try that and see if
it's actually similar there's also a
mascara and also these packaging and
also the products they feel really light
and that's because they're trying to
save money on the packaging not filling
it with all kinds of rubbish there's a
mascara and also perfecting powder
perfecting powder perfection so this is
just a powder but it looks like it could
be a little bit of a highlight to have
to say I absolutely love the idea of
this sounds like a genius business and
I'm very excited to try out products
I'll let you guys know how I got along
and I'll leave a link to where you can
buy Beauty pipe from down below I think
it's like a membership so you get boxes
every month I think we'd like to invite
you to become one of our founding
members an informal Beauty pie and
master at-large and it's come with this
card so start your membership at below
okay so it looks like I'm gonna get a
six month membership with this card
which is very exciting
so yeah I'll leave the information in
the website down below so I think you
guys are gonna like this one because it
just sounds like really good quality
peach products without the price tag
which why would you not like
another powerful rule that I actually
unwrapped at doddle was from sweaty
Betty it was just in a beautiful but
very big box so I actually under the box
so I have had a sneak peek at these but
I didn't look too closely it came in a
Christmas card so I presume is a
Christmas card so let's have a little
open up this first Merry Christmas
DJC thank you for all your support this
year let's all wear yoga pants to
Christmas dinner Merry Christmas love
from everyone absolutely Betty that's
really lovely and then they've also put
in a pair of leggings which are actually
very similar but a little bit different
to the ones I'm wearing right now
oops if you can see them I'm wearing all
sweaty Betty today by the way I'm like a
thumb god this is disgusting I wore this
outfit to the gym did my workout in this
and then cuz I went straight to the
hairdresser's I'm still wearing it
that's where grace will move swiftly on
but these are a beautiful pair of
leggings I think they're probably the
antigravity leggings they definitely
feel like it ultimate workout fabric yes
we know this witty-bitty or fabrics are
the best regular I think they are the
empty anti-gravity but either way a
sweaty Betty workout where it's just my
absolute favorite so they very kindly
sent me some new leggings perfect for
the new year and then the LA a very
bright you definitely won't miss me in
the gym if I wear this workout vest and
it's a really lovely light weight
material similar to the material of the
one I'm wearing underneath this this is
a sweaty Betty just like a workout vest
really nice I'll show you it properly
next time I go to the gym so thank you
very much sweaty Betty you guys will be
seeing me wearing this in a vlog very
soon no doubt
next is a bag from ASOS I have a feeling
this might have come from the ASOS head
office as opposed to one of my orders
but I may be wrong so let's open it up
and have a look okay first of all we
have a pair of shoes oh my goodness okay
I think actually maybe these are part of
another Instagram that I'm doing because
I don't think I would have ordered these
okay I mean they're not to my personal
taste but keeps nonetheless and then
also in here is a fluffy jumper this is
so random
at least I'm thinking it's for this
Instagram post but I've got to do I like
this actually that's really funny so
it's a blue jumper with like knitted
sleeves but then the middle section is
all furry that's so funny like a giant
hell blue teddy bear with a hairy chest
so random but yeah I definitely didn't
order those okay
time for the second scene sleazebag
there's lots of the Lottie London makeup
in here so there's a selfie ready medium
coverage in that foundation and then all
about that base full coverage of matte
foundation in a stick this one all about
that base exactly the same though we
have got shimmer squad four-piece powder
highlighter quad I'll attempt this that
looks really really nice so they've got
these four different shades quite
similar to the anastasia cloak it shades
i must say you've got peachy one more
golden shimmer or white shimmer get the
cheekbones and then a more bronzy
shimmer all in this little compact
really lightweight as well and I think
multi London are very good prices that's
a really nice affordable highlight quad

antidotes level one conditioner and
shampoo I actually used to swear by the
red set which I think was level three
when I was maybe like 17 18 I used to
get my hand in there quite cheap
hairdressers and the bleach that she
used destroyed my hair and when your
hair is in bad condition is so naughty
and the TG Bed Head urban antidotes
level 3 was the only conditioner that I
could use to untangle my hair so I'm
really looking forward to twenties again
it'll be a little bit of a flashback

little bundle from
