joining me for today's video you may
have noticed I'm not in my living room
I'm not in my house in fact I am in my
hotel room in Ibiza and I was just
unpacking having had enough sunshine my
first day and I thought I'd share with
you a few of my new pieces which I
picked up specifically for this holiday
I wish I had time to do a final haul
because you may remember that last week
was home week on my channel and yet I
didn't have time for someone to Friday
so this is kind of making up for that in
it is basically a hoard of everything I
picked up for this trip is going to lots
of really lovely summer holiday pieces
and also affordable brands we've got
some April's River Island Topshop and
mini collar bits from mango and some
shoes from eco as well so without
further ado let's get started with my
new pieces I don't want to forget about
this jumpsuit that I'm wearing at the
moment or actually I'd say it's more of
a plate suit because it's short at the
bottom I somehow already managed to get
it dirty I think I spoke a little
whiskey on it earlier but this to me is
a really classic summer holiday piece
it's the kind of thing that only cost
around because 25 pounds but you will
get so so so much use out of something
like this because it's just elasticated
it's off the shoulder you can still get
a nice tan on your shoulders when you're
sitting and just chilling outside but
also because it scratches up so small
and it's such a lovely light weight
material if it's perfect sticking a
beach bag if you're going on any boat
trip but also it's smart enough to have
lunch in just take so many boxes so this
is one piece that seems I tried it on in
changing rooms I just knew I had to get
it for my upcoming holidays and I'm also
just going to take my shoe off and show
you this because I mentioned these in a
previous video in my inaudible hall and
they hadn't arrived yet but they have
now arrived these are of course dupes
for Valentino espadrilles but they were
620 pounds
everything I spoke about in this video
will be linked down in the description
box but I have
these are very comfortable I've worn
pretty much the whole time I've been
here so far they've got beautiful very
pale rose gold II pinky metallic leather
and then the gold studs around the edges
I just think that absolutely stunning
and I do have a couple more kinds of
shoes from that retailer as well so
another thing I picked up actually
yesterday in the Topshop personal
shopping space in Oxford Circus which
I'm now totally converted to I love that
little area just really makes shopping
so much more pleasurable I always feel
so much stuff with me but the fact that
I can have a room to myself and just
free my hands of everything one's run
stalls makes so much difference so I
picked up this bag from Topshop and just
felt that it is a perfect holiday bag
it's got a zippy top so it's nice and
secure
it's this kind of straw rusty material
you've got some hanging threads of
nether and nice long straps really roomy
beach bag and it does have a lining
which makes it a little bit more secure
as well so I actually use it as my
travel bag and that's but I'm pretty
much going to be using every single day
while I'm out here this bag was actually
very kindly sent to me as part of a
blogger mail from the garden so thank
you very much
and 4,000 if you're watching but this is
from skinny-dip and I previously didn't
really know that's good yep did anything
like this I thought they were all just
kind of bright colors phone cases but
this is absolutely beautiful I wore it
when I went into town and it's a weave
this little white clay suit and I just
love the outfit but it's so cute and
really is just taking that trend of
tassels embroidery and straw bags
because straw bags are just such a huge
trend this summer so very very grateful
to have been kindly sent this one and I
just absolutely love it perfect for a
visa okay so this next piece I haven't
actually tried on yet which I know is
very risky
bringing it away when I haven't tried it
on yet but I will insert some
transcripts here this is a lacy t-shirt
dress it's very long it's definitely
going to hit the ground for me but then
it's got the button-down detail all the
way down there also I'm sorry about the
nice thing is it's going a bit strange
of course and some
in a hotel room which is my camera on a
tripod so no lighting setup so sorry
just going really overexposed but this I
just think it's going to be so gorgeous
to put it on over bikini very relaxed
red shield but also you could definitely
dress this up with heeled sandals for
dinner as well I'm even wear this one
tonight
this leaves effect in the middle working
is very flattering we accentuate the
waistline and then you've got the flames
embroidery all over the tops all over
the bottom and then it's kind of a new
Mandi cotton material it's not been in I
don't think tractor me to check yeah
it's 100% cotton which just means it's
not you do care for a little bit more
breathable with some of the other some
of the man-made fibers so this should be
a really lovely lightweight one and you
can stick on and the really elegant are
your holidays I'm excited to get lots of
use out of this one because it suits me
a couple of accessory before we move
back to clothing oh these ones I picked
up from ASOS I'll be 58 down below again
I was going to show you them during
whole week that isn't arrived on time
these I think are spectacular so
obviously they look very very similar to
Chloe sunglasses but in fact they were I
think 25 pounds and I've seen they're so
stylish they've got a gradient lens so
darker at the top light at the bottom
rose-gold very fine frames honestly I
think they look so much more expensive
than they were I definitely think these
could past as Chloe sunglasses so really
chuffed with those and then I also
picked up this pair these once again
I've got more of a yellowy gold you've
got this cat eye flicks going on here
and these are just really my favorite
kind of style I love cat eye sunglasses
I think it's the shades of moon suits my
space so Stephanie and again hey a lot
of you have dozed then we have a bikini
I actually picked this top up in a size
8 and it is a little bit big for me I
would have gone for a 6 but they were
all sold out but I thought it was so
beautiful they couldn't walk out the
store without it so I did think of a
size slightly bigger this straps are
adjustable though so hopefully I can
make it feel a little bit
by just pulling up those straps but this
bikini I thought was major Zimmermann 5
so I've been teasing myself by the
community women online which is of
course a premium Australian retailer and
now bikinis around the three or four
hundred pound mark this one was I think
it's 20 pounds of top 16 pound to the
bottom they're much more affordable with
definitely along the same lines so
that's the top and then here are the
bottoms or if it's still got like their
hygiene because then all yet the bottoms
I did manage to get it fixed which is
great because there's nothing worse than
a saggy bottom one more pair of
sunglasses and a Jane I feel that these
look really designer always like Fendi
because they have this little cutout
section here and also the cat eye slick
but then you've got tortora shell detail
going around the edges yeah I think they
look very very high-end cat eye shape
once again we're in fluttering and I
think they look a lot more expensive
than they were and the thing I love
about these is they don't have these
little nose toggles because they always
get stuck in my hair so the days on the
beach sunglasses like these two pairs so
much better to me because I don't end up
spending ages trying to detangle my hair
from my skin buzzes alright so here's
another fashion item and this is so
Ibiza I tried it on and immediately knew
it has come with me my suitcase it's
just another really easy to wear put on
a summer dress kiba's is really lovely
almost crochet detail along the neckline
off the shoulder stretchy super comfy
and then some embroidery in there as
well this is just probably the most
obese thing you could possibly buy very
chilled out very almost like hippie 65
and then you've got an elasticated waist
and the same detail from the hemline is
also along the bottom as well so really
just times together to be a beautiful
outfit I think that if you told someone
littles designer they will probably
believe you because it's just that
really beautiful timeless style and yeah
definitely taking this on a lots of my
upcoming holidays is just going one of
those pieces instant outfit add some
sandals at a cute bag and you're done so
when I was unpacking I realized I've
definitely bought far too many shoes
with me so I'm going to really quickly
withdrew my shoes these are another pair
from ego once again Valentino dupes
I actually
these in my normal size but they feel a
little bit tight so if you're going to
go to this designer I recommend going to
sign up they're wearable but I just
prefer them to be a little bit bigger so
they've got this lovely blush pink suede
the straps has got the volunteer X gold
studs in rose gold and other than that
they're just kind of plain as virtual
but it says give them a really beautiful
high-end divide about them another pair
of shoes from the same retailer these
are also Valentino dupes again really
just kind of stocking up on this start
moment I think that's so beautiful
these however I have to say are quite
hard to get on and off there's something
about this leather that's almost sticky
so it kind of just makes it quite hard
to do up and under the buckles I
actually tried putting them on every
night an hour off doing my nails my
soaking mess but my nail varnish but
having said that once they're on they do
look lovely because they have got the
distract exactly the same Valentino
sandals and this gold color I find very
timeless and really glancing as well
it's very elegant color so despite them
being quite a spot on often still really
allocate these thumbs up pair of sandals
from River Island these are just like a
tan suede then you've got the type
straps and I didn't tie around the ankle
is a really big trend when we see a lot
more that's our and it also you've got
some gold stubbing on the heel really
practical heel height you could
definitely go Road environment on my
cold streets which you often see a lot
of on Spanish irons I could be sir
so yeah nice and comfortable very
wearable all day long and then I really
like how refined shoes the moment I've
got this gold detail I just think it
makes me look a little bit more high-end
so similarly these different River
islands just white sandals with a gold
detail under the heel which just gives
it a really lovely design detail makes
them a little bit more expensive and
these I can already tell are going to be
so well on this summer I always get pair
of white sandals beginning of these
summer season and they end up in my most
Ward shoes so these were 40 pounds which
i think is incredible price per where
I'm learning and aware these like a
hundred times so they're definitely
going
be one of the best value pieces in my
summer wardrobe I can already feel it
and then my final pair of shoes from
River Island are the I'm kind of 50/50
about than when I saw them on the
website but now that I have them I am in
love with these I actually was traveling
yesterday and find them so comfortable
they're just very once again elegant
looking you've got white folk rock
effects detail on the toe cap got a gold
here a very small pencil heel height
which makes it perfect for everyday wear
and because they slip on you just find
yourself popping them on to so many
different occasions I more than we might
think of metallic Topshop culottes and I
just really love the outfit I felt the
beads David a really high-end finish so
think big fan of these from Andhra
violent sorry if I'm going through
things really quickly it's because I
don't need to be a super long video and
I did buy quite a lot of things which
probably won't surprise you because you
all know who would Shopaholic I am but
this is another piece from a sauce it's
a brand from Moon River
I bought loads of their things before
and absolutely love them there's a
lemonade suit so I wore in Monaco and
then um these enemy embroidered jump
suit that I wore off in India so this is
my latest purchase from Moon River and
is a long blue dress because of shoulder
detail blue stripes and we got this
embroidery detail on these straps work
which just gives a really nice finish
tying at the waist and then a scalloped
hem down at the bottom which just gives
it a really beautiful finish once again
quite bohemian quite hippie style so
really perfect before I beat up I picked
up this bag while I was in the Top Shop
personal shopping concession and this I
thought I had crimson vibes about it
with it's very squared files I haven't
even opened it yet I don't know how them
oh there we go I really like how it kind
of stands out as well so if you don't
have much in it maybe just a little bit
of cash to firm and it could be quite a
thin envelope club and if you do want to
put your camera it is quite spacious
inside by to being very thin very chic
you can fit quite a lot of things
and the big fan of crossbody bags as
well because it means you have your
hands-free or in my case amuse I don't
have my hands on my camera at all times
so yeah they found this and also got a
little back pocket which is super handy
for things like your phone or your
oyster card so they found this one
hasn't broken still on you you cave well
it can get very chic but a really
practical one for wearing on holiday a
couple of pairs that sound off from
Topshop so you might have already seen
these on a recent blog post of mine I'm
warden with a denim dress but these once
again I'm taking off that strong trend
or that very natural kind of material
trends that summer and I also have loved
the embroidery on these once again
you've got the time on the ankle closure
really ugly chunky heel which makes them
a lot easier to walk in and it's not too
high it definitely gives me the height
boots that I need but we broke that rib
island and sure as I showed you earlier
but again because thick heel it makes it
a lot more comfortable
these are 52 pounds are a little bit
more pricey but I feel like they really
had statements your outfit so I wouldn't
two against spending that amount of
money on these one the last pair of
shoes another pair of sandals from
Topshop these were 42 pounds once again
you've got the strap that goes around
and cool and as you can see it's got a
beautiful embroidery embellishment and
then also three tassels this is a
slightly different color for me it's
more like a movie dark gold coppery
color and then you've got the leather
strap to go over the foot and then up
the ankle but yeah but these are going
green up in bohemian for a chilled-out
eyes and would look really nice with
this I think slightly less bohemian but
very me I picked up this jumpsuit from
Topshop it's light blue you've got this
almost like daffodils but they're just
beautiful yellow flowers ruffle detail
off the shoulder in fact that this is
just the most beautiful lightweight
material I feel like it's the kind of
thing on hot summer days when they then
don't want to have my necks outside
still want to be really nice and cool
and breezy this is going to be perfect
price-wise forty-two pounds and I feel
like it's such a complete outfit that's
42 pounds mixes a really great value
piece I think with little flat sandals
or even some nice court heels this is
going to survive ish and it's also
really beautifully fitted it soon
have darts in all the right places and
I'm three kids and how this one looks on
so a lot of two pieces I picked up this
dress once again in Topshop personal
shopping you may have seen this on my
Instagram stories this once again is a
site too big for me but I could not
resist it it's so beautiful this is a
really lightweight white summer dress so
you've got these two buttons and then a
tie waist as well so you can really fit
this to your exact waist measurement
it's got pockets got a beautiful drape
to it it's got a little slit in the edge
here so it's very kind of slightly leg
revealing but not too much it's just a
beautiful timeless elegant lady like
piece I feel like this is going to run
in treatment I'm going to want to wear
every single day in summer so I
apologize in advance that you guys will
be seeing a lot of this but once again
if you guys till you have a similar
style to me then I would definitely
recommend picking up this piece because
I'm asking in love with it it's making
me a little bit emotional country about
how much I love it
but it really is a fabulous piece it's
also got a slipped in the back which i
think is one's going to really cool
design detail I can actually mushroom to
Middleton wearing this is just so
ladylike and it also comes in khaki as
well if that's more your thing
apparently it comes in pink I've not
seen that one and last but not least I
picked up this pair of little flat shoes
from Topshop they were 26 pounds which i
think is incredible value once again
really easy to stick on with little
places like this with jeans just add and
one sugar 25 to fit and I'm going to
take this material is I kind of and
thicker during the week cause type
materials with any what's great Parisian
style so on it a very spongy soul is
well sitting really comfortable but yes
converse or so for my holiday wardrobe
so that's everything new that I picked
up for my trip to Ibiza I'm probably
going to film like an outfit diary type
video as well you can see what occasions
my where each of these things to make
sure you give this video a thumbs up if
you would like
that kind of video from me and but yeah
I'm gonna pack all of these things is
the Wardrobe now and I sleep on
particular and have another cup of tea
in the late afternoon light shine so
