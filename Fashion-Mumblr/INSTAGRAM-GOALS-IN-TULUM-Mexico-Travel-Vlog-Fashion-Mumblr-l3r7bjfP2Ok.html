late last night and we went to mand very
very early a bit jet-lagged so we are
staying at a lovely hotel called el path
which means the fish in Spanish and it
is on the main tulum beach too long
we've kind of figured out it's a bit of
it's kind of like one long road with
everything all the lovely hotels
restaurants etc are along this road so
it's gonna be hopefully very easy to
navigate our room is very typical Tulum
style very simple rustic beach chic and
today we're gonna have some breakfast we
had a really amazing dinner here at the
hotel last night we just ordered all the
tacos on the menu everything like a
giant Tucker this morning and yeah we're
gonna have a nice breakfast here and
then we're gonna rent some bicycles from
the concierge and we're going to cycle
to the ruins it's only 7 a.m. but we are
ready to go the Sun is already out and
it's going to be a beautiful day

on the beach here Charlie's doing some
Instagram stories we have a three-course
breakfast starting off with some fresh
papaya and I've also ordered a smoothie

and we pedaled 20 minutes down the road
to the site of the ancient Mayan ruins
with datagram total about three pounds
in Mexican pesos get in and we are gonna
go and see the what's left of I think
their pyramids there are mine University

just to stay while rolling into the
night

and I've spent the past hour or so
relaxing on the beach we've come to a
place called Azul ik which is actually
another hotel and they have a really
lovely area beach I've got a Bharata
flatbread with lots of nice cheese and
sun-dried tomato Charlie is demolishing
a tuna ceviche

end in terms of price other places
around the beach is lovely and here
