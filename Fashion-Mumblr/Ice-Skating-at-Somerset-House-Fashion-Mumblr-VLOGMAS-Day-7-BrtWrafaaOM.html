I have my lovely videographer Kat coming
around for the whole day and we are
filming and photographing so much stuff
so you might remember in my last vlog I
was telling you how stressed I was and
how many deadlines I had so I'm just
gonna have a super productive day
tomorrow yesterday for you guys and take
off so many things off my to-do list get
Kat to help me with my biography and
photography and hopefully I'll be a lot
less stressed after I've got that done
so you guys will have seen my Christmas
decoration hall video in its place
because I just don't want to be vlogging
as well as doing all those things I need
to do tomorrow so hopefully you guys
don't mind that but um I hope you
enjoyed the Christmas decoration haul
instead so today is going to be a really
lovely and festive day I'm about to head
into town in a second and I'm going to
the Kurt Geiger store in Covent Garden
because they've just launched the
snapchat and I'm gonna be doing a
snapchat takeover for them and showing
you guys around the store picking out
some shoes and doing a little bit of
shopping that'd be really fun I'll take
you guys with me there Covent Garden at
Christmas is so beautiful and festive if
you've never been then keep on watching
because it's so so lovely around there
at the moment I'm just at home with this
little chap and you may have seen this
morning I think I showed you um we went
for breakfast at a restaurant in Clapham
I met a PR that lives nearby so we just
met close to where we both live which is
really handy and I've just been tidying
this room I don't think it's been this
tidy in years because this is where
we're gonna do all of the filming
tomorrow so I thought I would get some
tidying done it's um it's half 12:00 now
I need to do my hair and then get into
town some meeting the girls occur Kiger
at 2:00 and then I'm going to Somerset
house and we're going to do some
ice-skating with the brand B or
ray and then we're having a Christmas
dinner I mean this dog you're something
else my sausage
he really is something else look how
he's just positioned himself and then we
are having dinner at a spring restaurant
in Somerset house it's gonna be a really
lovely fun day and I'm excited to take
you guys with me so I'm gonna get myself
ready kiss this boy a little bit more
and then we'll head out and do some
shopping
are you for real Dexter is this actually
how you're gonna position yourself I
think you're the most handsome puppy in
the world so much I love your paws I
love your Harry Potter
oh that's been a hard day Rooney silly
boy my silly little sausage so I just
received a lovely delivery and I thought
I would open it with you guys it is from
flutter force lashes by Ilia and I can
see there's some beautiful flowers
inside so let's have a little rummage
inside this very beautiful blogger mail
we have got little note flutter your way
through the new Fleur lashes gjc so I
send you a couple of my new lash designs
for IU I hope you like them let me see
it time for word the other day back send
my love to Charlie in Mexico with Lola
Molly cute these are the fully Fleur
lashes they look like a good midway
point between bold and natural might
give these ones a try later on today and
then oh I had a feeling these would come
out again so fleurs ones last time I
seen they were cool like the demi
whispies I'm not sure that were like a
third or about a half of the normal size
of lashes they were my favorite and
she's brought out a new version of those
these are petite Fleur and also inside
is this beautiful little bunch of
flowers in very Fleur colors pastel
lilac pink and cream so beautiful and
perfect timing with me doing some
filming tomorrow so these can be a
beautiful little prop to put in the
background so thank you for if your
watch
excited to try the new lashes so I'm
ready to head out now and I'm feeling so
wintry in my new coat I just absolutely
love this I feel like I don't wear white
coats now because I'm afraid of getting
stuff spilt on them so I'm going to have
to be on my best behavior today but let
me show you my outfit of the day so this
beautiful new white coat with the fur
collar this is from River Island I'll
leave it linked down below and then to
keep things even more festive I've got
my gold Valentino Rockstar bag and then
you guys must be so bored of these
trousers they are my fergan de saucé
ones absolutely love them and then my
mango boots
another classic piece for me this season
so heading out now to the Covent Garden
Kirk Geiger store Celsius okay so I'm in
the Kirk I could store in Covent Garden
and it didn't take me too long to fall
in love with a few pairs of shoes let me
show you what I'm trying on so these you
guys already know that absolutely love
these I've been wearing my black ones so
often as I showed you earlier I need to
find a replacement and I feel like these
are gonna do the job perfectly wooden
and metallic heel and black can't really
go wrong and then the ones I'm trying on
now I will show you these are like a
burgundy oxblood color with a chrome
heel and how well they go with these
trousers perhaps you love them now to
make a tough decision which ones we're
going for and can we just take a moment
to appreciate the beauty of these shoes
it was so stunning I think if I have any
evening events where I'm wearing a
shorter dress where I can show them off
which I will show you guys later also
while I was doing the take mover I
discovered that if you just watch the
curve I get snapchat because it's just
launched you can potentially win the a
Kirk I could take it back so the cart
guard snapchat is just at Kirk I could
snap and if you head over there and
watch the story then you could be one of
five people each day to win a prize so I
thought that was really cool and I
thought I just know you guys know Nate's
one to enter
yeah I'm just having a wander round
Covent Garden now it's looking beautiful
and festive as I predicted it would do
and then I'm going to just find
somewhere that's got Wi-Fi I'm going to
set it with my laptop and I've got three
hours until high speaking
isn't it beautiful here so it's so
lovely apparently they're super strict
with cameras on the ice I'm gonna blow
this well yeah we're gonna be not much
for my camera on underneath my jacket
sneezes it's all about the blogger babes
here and interesting to see who they're
secretly Pro Nick in the way
I feel like it is
okay feel like I'm getting a bit better
now
a speed round we have to slow take us
behind Halloweeny
we just arrived into spring restaurants
and some of the house for dinner back
home again now and had such a fabulous
evening with all the girls I've got my
comfy jumper on and I'm just about ready
to go to bed but before I do I thought I
would just show you the new bureau
products which they launched this
evening or that we discovered this
evening and the range is based on baking
powder or it's kind of what do they call
it baking soda pour cleanser so Biore I
didn't actually know this but they are
in the top ten facial cleansing brands
in the whole world and I think they
might have said number one in Japan
which is seriously impressive because
Japanese women are obsessed with their
skin so that's really made me even more
excited to try these products so the new
ones are the baking soda pore cleanser
for kind of daily gentle exfoliation and
then the second one which I'm really
excited to try is the baking soda
cleansing scrub so this is literally
like finer than salt crystals in here I
poured some um I haven't earlier to try
it it's the most tiny tiny particles so
it just gives you a really gentle
exfoliation and you mix it a little bit
with water and just give yourself a nice
good old scrub to deep clear the pores
and then this is what I know VRA for
these are their deep cleansing charcoal
poor strips so I've used them on my nose
before but I've actually got a few
blackheads on my chin and these are
those really satisfying strips where you
can like feel the crap coming out of
your skin and then you can see on the
strip kind of gross but I love that
satisfying feeling of seeing all the
gunk that was once in your skin on the
strip so gonna give myself a nice
cleansing and then get rid of some
blackberries must be getting bored of me
taking my makeup off in front of the
camera bye
now but as usual going to start with my
Garnier micellar water this is the oil
infused one and I just find it nice and
nourishing on my skin especially this
time of year
so I'm using a couple of pumps of the
baking soda pool cleanser and I think
this one just has a tiny bit of
exfoliation particles within it so good
for daily exfoliation it's definitely a
really gentle one I can feel some little
beads in there though although I think
now I hope of ease so nothing nasty for
the environment no like a god
and now I'm going to try out the baking
soda cleansing scrub so this is the one
where you pop a little bit of powder
into your hands so I've put a tiny tiny
amount into my hand you can see that I'm
just gonna add a teeny bit of water to
make it into a bit of cake and then put
it on my face and then I'm just gonna
use my warm flannel or little cleansing
cough remove it my skin genuinely
doesn't feel super duper smooth but I'm
not gonna finish that I'm gonna do a
triple attack or pause and I'm going to
use the buery for your pores deep
cleansing charcoal pork strips now I put
this on upside down
oh my god I say sticky
I want the new one key
that feels super sticky oh my god I can
already tell this is gonna lift all of
the gunk out okay this is a nose strip
but I figured it will work anyway oh my
goodness okay let's see if this works
see you in ten minutes okay I'm tucked
up in bed with Chaz and we're watching
Love Actually but my masks have been on
for like 10-15 minutes now and it's fun
kind of hard and if you can hear them
but they kind of stiff like paper mache
it says on the thing so let's see this
is not painful see that little black
sticking out which I guess is all crap I
can see actual blackheads and a few
satisfying I think next time I'm gonna
put a hot flam on my face to open up my
pores and hopefully get every last one
out so I'll let you know what I do that
keep you updated
I'm going to go to bed now it's been a
long day so I hope you guys enjoyed this
vlog and the next time I vlog will be
Thursday and that's gonna be really fun
day there is the Clarins Christmas party
which is always really good fun and I'm
just doing lots of nice fun things in
town so I will see you then if you got
this far in this vlog then leave a green
heart in the comment section so I know
which of you guys made it the end and
I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
