today I'm in a little bit of a different
surrounding I've got Jay with me lovely
Jay and we are in the great Fosters and
it's just absolutely stunning I think I
want to move in so does Jay he's already
taken a bed goals photo of this
incredible scenery but we're here
because I'm gonna be shooting a little
festive lookbook and lots of lovely
outfit photos hence hence Jay so yeah
we're gonna go outside and take some
lovely photos this room though hello
it's me you probably don't even remember
what I look like because it's been so
long since I last logged actually when I
edit this this will be straight after my
lunchtime Clips but in real life it's
been a long time with a very bad blogger
again vlogger not a bad blogger I'm a
bad vlogger rambling but yeah I'm at
Mama's house now had a very productive
day with Jay at the great Fosters and we
took loads of photos and notes of video
clips as well and for my festive look
book which is coming your way very soon
and I'm really really excited to show
you cuz it looks lovely
but um yeah because basically we were
rushing against the Sun going down which
happened at half past three we didn't
really have time to vlog so what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to do today and
tomorrow all in one because this would
be the world's shortest and Kravis vlog
so yeah you're gonna see tomorrow as
well shortly but um tonight yeah I'm at
Mom's house now we've just actually just
had a little nap because I was quite
knackered and it's about seven o'clock
now we're about to go back to the great
Fosters where we were shooting today at
mum and I are not Jay he's gone home get
Oh Jay you had lovely chats and just a
really fun time with him he's such a
great photographer if you don't know Jay
is the photographer who works with
Olympus
I'm just generally amazing any of my
blog Rafi
which look fab they're his so yeah
really good day with J mom and I going
back to great Fosters now for dinner
which is very exciting it's such a
magical place so I shall take you along
with me there
morning guys it's Wednesday morning now
and I'm really blurry there we go um
yeah it's Wednesday morning now had a
really SuperDuper evening at the great
Fosters last night if you guys live
anywhere near sorry Oh Virginia water I
go in particular and I definitely
recommend you go there it's so nice we
had it was kind of like a tasting menu
it was about six courses in there tutor
room and everything that was so
delicious my favorite thing don't know
this is like a good or a bad thing to
say but my favorite thing was actually
at the canapes so you had a little
canapes with our cocktails and three
very artistic little canapes and one of
them was a pumpkin risotto ball arancini
risotto ball and I think I had truffle
in it as well there's something about it
it was just amazing so yeah II love that
yeah back home now got really puffy eyes
haven't any makeup on as you can see and
yeah my eyes are bit puffy this morning
I think I might be animate with cold I
feel a little bit banged up but don't
feel too bad right now so just in case
cold is about to strike I'm gonna try
and be really really productive today
Charlie's already done the washing
boyfriend points which means I can just
get on with stuff I think while it's not
dark because as we know it got dark at
about two o clock yesterday I'm gonna
film a video for you to see last night
so for you to see tonight in my time
well last night in your time because
yeah because this vlog it's going to day
one which means they weren't even a
video up yesterday so I think I might do
an everyday drugstore winter slash
trusted makeup routine it won't look
anything like this obviously but before
I do that I'm gonna make a coffee
Dexter's got something this could be
dangerous what if you got you cheeky
monkey up is he's bone I'm sorry I was
blaming you for nothing
Oh Charlie use my mug
word okay I'll make a copy in a
different mug let's have a look what
flavor are we gonna have this morning
likes me of that tell me like Oh Dexter
was getting so much love on the train
over there was a group of girls and I
was sitting next to with all of my stuff
and they just fell in love with him I
was like oh you have to follow him on
Instagram so she'd have a few more
followers now oh my gosh I need to shake
my phone background look at this oh he's
so cute
silly play my fave business presser
machine is the best thing in the world
so while my coffee is brewing or
whatever that word is coming out the
Machine and when I asked your opinion on
something so I want to paint the kitchen
this is my kitchen
we've got like a duck egg flew up there
at the moment and then gray tiles and
the grey floor this is probably the best
the lighting is gonna get in winter um
oh my eyebags are making me feel ill and
then the cupboards are white really kind
of Nath wood but it's not very good
quality but I just thought instead of
getting new cupboards which will cost me
an absolute bomb I'm just gonna paint
them again and so yeah I'm not sure
colors to go for I've also bought some
new handles for the kitchen cupboards
okay here's the handle so the moment
we've just got these like playing silver
ones but I bought some like this hmm
so hopefully they'll look quite nice but
so I want to repaint the cupboards and
repaint that bit up there
so we're thinking like a kind of green
color if you know firearm ball paints
kind of like a missile color which is
like sage green with a little bit bit
lighter because I thought that would go
quite nice with all the gray but yeah if
any of you are particularly good at
knowing what colors work well let me
know because my first project of 2015
2016 do you guys have a manager this is
my manager if you listen to Michael
McIntyre you'll know what I mean
that screws I just can't measure that
trees don't even know if they work light
bulbs adapters gate clicker matches all
kinds of crap in the man drawer
already the makeup is off I'm not
looking to snazzy right now brightness
um yeah gonna start filming that
everyday makeup routine got my little
bundle of products down here
I haven't actually filmed a makeup
routine video in quite some time and I'm
trying to remember how I had the mirror
I think I might try and because I see
like my merit
and I can't really see it and I can't do
my makeup in the viewfinder so I think I
might build like little stack of a
softbox there's on the bed and prop my
mirror that's hiding behind the tree on
that yeah let's see how this goes okay I
feel like little stack there move there
let's see if I put my mirror on it
yeah that should be okay cool
all righty let's put the lights on tree
lights are on nice festive background my
festive jumper on this is from ASA oh
whoa what happened there I have no idea
I also want to show you my leggings cuz
they're really really cute so first of
outfit for the video this is a jumper
which I got from a source you might have
seen it in my jumper haul and when I
tried it on for the Christmas jumper
party props now becoming one of my
favorites
even though not focusing and there's
quite like Swedish it's got this almost
embroidery prints on it
and then these little leggings which are
adorable you guys might recognize these
from don't know what the problem is is
focusing today there we go
yeah these adorable little leggings I
had got them from Primark you may have
seen them in my festive Primark haul by
the way look at this so we had a
Christmas jumper party on Saturday and I
was trying out my new hair colors left

during the party and decided to do their
hair or we do it and left them on the
floor and yeah carpet is now busted this

fugly Hey Oh get ready with me if we
don't make it routine because my face is
looking puffy it seems gonna the
rest of my coffee and I get cracking
