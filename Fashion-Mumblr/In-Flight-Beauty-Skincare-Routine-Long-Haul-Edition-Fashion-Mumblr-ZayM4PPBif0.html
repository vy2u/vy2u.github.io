having a really good day today I've just
been putting together my beauty kit for
my flight on Thursday I'm heading it to
Costa Rica which I'm so excited about
and it's an 11 hour flight which i think
is the longest time in one go that I
will ever have been on airplane so I put
quite a lot of effort and thought into
my beauty kit which I'm gonna be taking
on the flight so I thought I would share
that with you in today's video I thought
it might be quite um I thought it might
be quite useful if you've got any
long-haul flights coming up or even a
kind of short to medium haul flight
although it might be a little bit too
much effort for a really short haul
flight anyway rambling aside let's get
started so when I'm on a long-haul
flight I really like to give myself a
bit of a pampering so this routine is
quite long and you can definitely skip
out steps of this or just pick and
choose the bits that you want to do on
your next slide but I'm going to go
through my full routine anyway because I
think it is quite a good one for
long-haul flights so as soon as the
plane is kind of cruising and we're up
in the air then I will take off my
makeup I find that aeroplane air can be
really really dehydrating and I want to
put lots of nice products on my face so
of course all the makeup has to go as
the first step I'll always have a few of
these mini face wipes sachets in my bag
because sometimes I like to use a face
wipe first and these are just little
balancing lavender ones which I got from
LMS I'm not actually sure exactly where
I picked these up from I have a feeling
it might have been some samples that
perhaps I got at a counter but these are
just so handy to keep in my plain bag
because the absolute tiny in the means I
don't have to carry a full set of face
wipes with me so this is usually the
very first thing that I do and then I'll
be a little bit more thorough and I will
use on my slim water to take off the
bulk of my makeup anything that's left I
usually will leave on my eyebrows and
eye mascara because that's not really
going to harm anything in the skincare
routine so I did find this absolutely
tiny little Bioderma
nice little water in my travel stash so
I have huge shoe box under my bed full
of samples and I always put mini sample
sizes in there so when I go traveling I
can just pick and choose like it
the candies thought which bits want to
take with me so had this mini Bioderma
and I've also got a little sachet where
thumbs got a hair on it with some cotton
pads inside it I think I actually got
this from a hotel room I always stash
these kind of things because they're so
useful for flying
so I'd use some rice and a water to take
off most of my makeup as soon as we are
in the air
now having something this tiny is really
handy because in the UK and in loads of
other countries I'm sure we have a
regulation that you're only allowed to
take this plastic bag bags worth full of
liquids so having something this tiny
just doesn't take up too much room
within the carrier bag
so once the makeup is off sometimes what
I'll do is use toner and because I don't
want to keep turning fro from the
bathroom something that I find really
really useful is these toning discs
which I picked up from Kolbert MD which
is when I've recently be going into the
skincare all their products are really
really lovely and these in particular I
absolutely love their kind of
exfoliating and toning all in one and
they're in presearch pads so really
really easy to do without leaving a
chair on the airplane so I rip my from
these sachets and just use one of these
paths there's only one in each sachet
just to give my face a little bit of
toning so I'm taking two packets with me
so I can do one on the right there and
one on the way back so when my face is
completely clean then I will start to
give myself a bit of a pampering and the
first thing that I'll do to add an
initial amount of moisture to my face is
use a store his use of serum this one
here is the quarterly vino source and I
haven't actually tried this one before
but on it is says serum SOS
thirst-quenching serum which sounds
exactly like the kind of thing the skin
will need on a plane when I used to
travel to New York every now and then
with work I used to use the origins
drink up mask but I've run out of my
little tube of that so I'm going to be
trying this one out on my trip on
Thursday so this is a pre moisturiser
serum it says it's moisturizing and
that's pretty much what I look for so
I'll be putting this all over my face
just patting it onto my clean skin next
I'll apply an eye serum and I've
actually got a couple of eye serums with
me one of them I'll be using now and the
next one I'll be using when I start to
apply my makeup ready for landing so the
one I'm going to use now is another
slushie from Corbin MD I actually picked
this up as a freebie I got it when I
went to their counter in Phoenix so this
is really really handy it's tiny sachet
so what I'll do is I'll just make a
really tiny kind of like pinprick
opening and just give it
a bit onto my fingers and Padamsee eye
area and I will actually reapply this
every now and then throughout the flight
always as Sasha it's not going to keep
very well so you might as well use as
much as it of it as you can it during
the flight so I'll put top this up every
couple of hours whenever I finish a film
or wake up or anything like that I'll
just pass a little bit more eye cream
but that's the next step and I thought
this tattoo is really handy it's so tiny
again not going to take up any room in
my little carrier bag the next thing
that I do kind of depends on what I plan
on doing next so if I want to fall
asleep or if I'm planning on watching
some films I'll probably try and fall
asleep as soon as possible on a plane so
for that reason I'll be taking this tiny
little mini of the dolphin eight flower
cream this is one that I actually have
in my evening skin care routine so I
know that my skin up city loves it the
smell is so gorgeous Sonia an aeroplane
this kind of smell just really makes you
feel like a honey a good pampering
routine and this tiny little pot again
not sure where I actually got this one I
think again it was from a glossy box
glossy box and Birchbox are both so so
great for little travel samples because
I mean it's so tiny again not going to
take up any room so I'll press this all
over my face and probably tripped off to
sleep once I've applied this
throughout the flight there are a few
extras which I love to do as well every
now and then I like to just refresh my
face and add a little bit more moisture
and for that in my box of goodies I
found the little instant foods to skin
tonic spritzer so this is a moisturizing
really fine mist spray which you can
just apply with a few squirts whenever
you feel like your skin needs a little
bit more moisture and they love to do
that maybe every hour possibly even more
regularly than that on the plane and
this again is 30 mil little tube to pump
so really good size for taking on
airplane I'll miss my face with this
every now and then just whenever I feel
like my skin needs a teeny bit more
moisture and in my kids as well I've got
a little hand cream this is one thing
I'll probably do quite soon in the
journey just apply the law of hand cream
this is the L'Occitane roses it red hand
and nail cream so I find that my hands
do get to work quite dehydrated on the
airplane so by just applying a little
bit of hand cream it's a really nice
experience part of the whole pampering
routine also of course keeps me hydrated
and this is something that's really good
if you find flying quite a stressful
experience I'm really lucky that I don't
really struggle too much as flying I
think because I've done it since I was
really really young I've been on long
haul flights and quite a lot of that my
life so I don't want it too stressful
but sometimes I do find it quite hard to
fall asleep so something like this which
is this works deep sleep stress less
roll-on so this is not one of their
normal sprays but instead it's a roll-on
which you kind of put on your pulse
points I'll apply it to my wrist and
behind the ears and it really just helps
to chill you out so if you find it hard
to sleep or if you do get a little bit
anxious or frightened on an airplane
then something like this is a really
really good thing to take on
you being they're really small I think
also neon do one and and someone else
I'm trying to think possibly Neal's Yard
remedies all the kind of natural
companies and they really do work
wonders I'll be so chilled out one so
applied this that it won't be long until
I fall asleep so when I wake up I
probably want to give myself a bit of a
paper a routine by that time my lotions
and potions on a full Sun care and I'll
be ready to go again so have a couple of
kind of optional experts also in my
airplane beauty kit and the first one is
a sheet mask now I prefer to do this
when I'm traveling with friends and I go
to Costa Rica matcha give me by myself
so I might look like a bit of a weirdo
doing this by myself but who really
cares and it's a sheet mask by ski I
hope I'm saying that right is just s ki
I hopefully that's pronounced ski but
this is a moisturizing skin quenching
sheet mask when I find sheet masks are
great because you don't need to go and
wet your face first or you don't need to
go and scrub your face and water
afterwards you just slap it on look like
a real dorka for fifteen or twenty
minutes take it off and let your skin
shrink in all those lovely moisturizing
ingredients it might be a good idea to
do this slightly towards the end of the
flight because then your skin is
probably really in need of those
ingredients when I used to do this on my
trips to New York I'd probably do it
after about five hours and this mask
would actually be dry by the time I took
it off because my skin just drank in all
of the goodness so a good idea to do
this towards the end another thing that
you can also do is use eye masks and
these are those kind of gels stick on
ones this is by Elemis at pro-collagen
hydrogel eye masks because I really do
suffer from dryness under the eyes I
find that they get a little bit wrinkled
on airplanes which is not a good look so
sometimes I pop these on again after
I've woken up or after I've been
watching your film or maybe during
watching your film and I put these on
for about 20 minutes during the flight
so that's really the bulk of my
pampering routine I just love to just
spend that little bit of time focusing
on my skin and making sure that I get
off the plane with better skin then I
got on it with which is a real
accomplishment when you're on an 11 hour
flight where your skin is just being
drained of all the moisture so I love
doing all of those bits to make myself
feel better and it's just a really
really fun experience but another part
of my in-flight beauty routine is
actually combating getting
ille so I find especially long-haul
flights that if you have any kind of bug
in your system you can guarantee that
when you get off the plane that bug will
be a full on illness or cold I
definitely used to find this when I flew
to New York in the wintertime if I had
the tiniest little hint of an illness or
a sniffle then I would have a full-on
cold by the time I landed so I've come
up with a little mini routine not
probably the sexiest and most attractive
routine but it really worked at stopping
me getting ill on holiday because who
wants to be ill on holiday not me so the
first part of my anti illness routine is
just to put a little bit of Vicks
VapoRub when I'm at home obviously into
a little Muji pot now this stuff you can
just pick it up from boots and I always
run when I was younger mom used to kind
of put this on my chest when I was not
feeling very well
or when I wanted to keep the germs away
so I've always had that in my head and I
thought it's really really easy simple
step to do when you're on an airplane so
I put a little bit in one of these tiny
tubs which I got a stack of them from
Muji and then when I'm on the plane it's
also one of the first things that I do
is I just put my fingers in there and
rub it onto my chest and sometimes
behind the ears as well now what this
means is that when you get warm if it
you can do it under your clothes as well
you obviously don't have to have an open
top but it means you're continually
inhaling these vapors and it really does
help to clear out the sinuses and also
protect against any bacteria that might
be lurking in the air so this is a
really good thing to do at the beginning
of long haul flights to kind of create a
barrier against any of the nasty germs
and might be on the airplane and on
those same lines and I know that loads
of you won't want to do this it's really
really dorky but I have a cold defense
nasal spray now I will probably go to
the bathroom is to do this because it's
just so dorky in my opinion to do this
in public but what it is is one of these
sprays you kind of do it up each nostril
and again it just acts as a barrier
against any germs so it might not be
germs on it in your body it might be
germs but on the plain but this really
does defend your body against any
lurking bacteria so it's dorky but it's
not as bad as having a cold when you're
on holiday which is honestly the worst
thing in the whole world so taking this
nasal spray with me and I'm not afraid
to use it so I've just picked up my
Vaseline and realized I forgot the lip
balm element of my beauty routine before
but sometimes I
Vaseline sometimes an even more
quenching lip-balm like the Clarins
hydra quench that will be part of my PT
routine before I fall asleep so yeah
sorry I forgot to mention that earlier
but the reason why I have Vaseline
specifically in my beauty kit is because
um because another thing that I like to
do to prevent myself from getting germs
is take a little bit of Vaseline and
line my nostrils with it now I know that
sounds really weird they actually read
it in something like glamour or Cosmo
and it's not exactly a medical journal
but they said that it can help prevent
any germs from going up your nose when
you're on an airplane so once again it's
one of these things it may work it may
not but I find that all these steps
together work for me I've not been
getting off the plane with a cold since
I've been doing them so I'll continue
lining my nostrils in Vaseline because I
don't want to get cold so a few more
bits and bobs in my beauty kit and one
of them is a hand sanitizer before I eat
or before I slap anything on my face
using my hands
I've always cleanse my hands with a hand
sanitizer this is the moisture plus
refreshing hand gel from Care Act's I
personally specifically chose a
moisturizing one because again anything
moisturizing on airplane is always a
bonus so that's why I picked this one up
in particular and I have also got a
pillow spray so as well as the roll-on
this is also by this works and if I'm
having trouble sleeping which to be
honest I don't usually on airplanes but
it's so tiny but I thought I'd also
stick this one in just to help me nod
off if I am finding it hard to go to
sleep
also got some tissues in my bag and I
haven't even showed you the bag so this
is what I keep the majority of my info
my PT kissing but then as I said the
liquids have to go in one of these facts
but also in this bag I'll take a packet
of tissues because you never know when
you're going to need tissues on the
airplane and I also sometimes put a
little bit of Elvis oil on a tissue
because again it's really good for
clearing my sinuses and protecting you
from any further colds in there as well
I've got a toothbrush in a plastic and
protector I don't like the idea of my
toothbrush just being floating around in
my bags I picked up super cheap this is
a plastic case from Boots and I've got a
teeny tiny little cold
a twitch I think I don't know I just
found this lurking around in one of my
drawers not sure I think you can get
them from boots in those kind of places
so I always like to brush my teeth
after I've woken up in a long-haul
flight that's also in my beauty kit and
I also have a few products here which I
like to use just before we land so I'll
probably reach for another one of my
little packets of face wipes and give my
face a nice clean before we start to
descend and put on another little bit of
moisturizer or maybe just spritz my face
again with it is Elle spritzer and then
I don't want to step off the plane with
a full face and makeup but this is just
to make me look and feel a little bit
more fresh and awake so the first thing
that I put on is the CC cream usually I
will decant something into another one
of these little Muji pots because this
is going to take up quite a lot of room
in my very restrictive carrier bag so
I'll pump some of this before I go into
a Muji pot and apply it with my fingers
and before starting with the rest of my
makeup and the only other things I
really do is fill in my eyebrows because
mine are really gapi and I don't feel
like my makeup is done at all without
eyebrows I'm just taking this really
tiny pencil which is the Urban Decay
brow beta and this really naturally and
finally fills in my eyebrows I've still
got a little bit of shaping color again
not taking up too much room and then I
found a sample of the benefit they're
real primer so this is a brown mascara
false eyelash primer and this is really
good nourishing for your lashes and it
could act as a base if you then want to
add a little bit more scar afterwards
but personally I find that this is
enough for me and it's a really tiny
little tube I think I got this was a
freebie bit magazine really handy always
keep a hold of minis like this this is
so so so useful and also I will apply a
little bit of under-eye concealer
because I suffer from eye bags at the
best of times so after a long haul
flight you can guarantee I'm going to
need something just to hide a little bit
of darkness under my eyes so I've chosen
the Hydra life BB eye cream from Dior
and this thing is a really nice
moisturizing one very blendable and
pretty much foolproof
finally a lip balm and this is the
Clarins instant light of the vehicle
isn't like lip balm protector in the
shade rosewood this is kind of like a
balm version of all my favorite lip
shades so I've really been loving that
brownie pink color in this balm is that
with the additional benefits of farm
brings or lots of moisturization
hydration for the lips and lovely subtle
pop of color so really not too much
makeup when I step off the plane but
just enough to make me feel good about
myself and look quite awake and
refreshed the final thing in my
in-flight beauty bag is a silk eye mask
and this I just find a little bit nicer
than the ones they give them the
airplanes if they give you one at all
most of time on long haul flights you'll
get one but they're a little bit
scratchy and you never know if someone's
used it before so I've got one of these
with me and this is a silk one really
beautiful soft material is by Olivia
Thornhill I was actually really calmly
sent this by Estee Lauder as part of
like a few tickets left
keep beauty sleep kit and I haven't used
it yet but this is definitely going to
be taken with me on the flight to Costa
Rica because it's so lovely and it looks
pretty and it feels feels absolutely
gorgeous in a wife a bonita show it to
you on but there we go so yeah this is
the last thing coming with me in my
beauty kit so all of those liquids
because I have just used in many sizes
will fit in one of these little plastic
bags which I give easily bring out of my
Charlotte till we make it back when I go
through security and then I'll just keep
everything together in this bag ready to
give myself a bit of a pamper when I get
on the airplane I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and enjoyed looking through
my in-flight beauty routine having
looked at it now I'm really excited to
sit on that plane and give myself a bit
of a pamper because it's been far too
long since I actually had that much time
to myself to just focus on giving myself
a bit of a pampering session so do give
this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it
and I'll also be filming of what's in my
carry-on because I'm also putting that
together for the flight as well so
hopefully you guys will want to watch
that one as well if you are off on any
long-haul journeys I hope you have a
good flight and a super holiday or trip
or whatever you're doing and I will see
you in the next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
