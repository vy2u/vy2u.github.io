joining me for today's video it is gonna
be an old-school January favorites today
and I say old-school because I think in
the whole of 2017 I didn't do favorites
videos I just thought that you know
there were so many of them out there why
would you want to watch mine but then at
the end of the year when I did my yearly
favorites I realized that there were so
many products that I hadn't had the
opportunity to talk about for example if
I had a favorite perfume and I just not
vlogged spritzing my perfume and I've
not done a specific perfume blog post
you guys didn't know what my favorite
perfume was and things like that so I
just thought that if I bring back
monthly favorites talking through beauty
style lifestyle all of the above then it
would be a really nice way of us having
a bit of a chatty catch-up about the
things I've been loving using this month
so hopefully it'll be really useful I'm
gonna try to do them every single month
so please let me know if it's something
that you would like to see give this
video a thumbs up if you would like to
see monthly favorites from me I think
with fashion you guys probably know what
I have been loving this month especially
if you follow me over on Instagram
because I tend to wear and wear and wear
the bits that I fall in love with so I'm
just going to really really quickly whiz
through my fashion favourites of January
starting off no surprises with this
tecnique coat it is a purpley pink
woolen coat and I think this is the
perfect thing to have in your wardrobe
just in case you have any special
occasions to go to during winter it's a
little bit more unusual than your
average piece of outerwear and to be
honest everybody loves this coat so much
I received so many compliments when I
wear this when I featured on my
Instagram you guys go a little bit crazy
you'll love it as much as I do it's so
warm and so snuggly and just a kind of
thing that in my wardrobe is going to be
suitable year after year cuz it's not
too on-trend if that makes sense
sticking with outerwear my next favorite
to no surprises once again I have been
spamming my Instagram with this it says
check coat from Reese now this was a
piece on the website that I was a little
bit unsure about and in my head I was
like you can always return it if you
don't like it but I decided to go for it
it's quite different for something that
I would usually go for but I have found
my
so wearing this so so often I wore this
pretty much the whole time we were in
Paris I've been wearing this loads
around London is the kind of thing where
if you have a fairly basic outfit this
makes your outfit look instantly
fashionable you can wear it just flowing
over the shoulders doesn't have a collar
so it's quite a relaxed bit but then it
does have a waist belt so you can really
put it in and still get that lovely
feminine silhouette so check print is
going to be absolutely huge this spring
so it's really lovely to have something
in my wardrobe that can give a nod to
that trend already and because this is a
lined coat but it's still fairly
lightweight it's not made of wool or
anything like that so this is going to
be a really fabulous transitional piece
when we do go into those warmer spring
months and that's when the trend will be
and it's full the flow everyone will be
wearing check so I'm really excited to
be ahead of the trend and have invested
in something that I'm sure will be a
staple in my spring wardrobe as well
another coat from Reese and this one is
more of a classic it is a perfect camel
coat fairly structured fit with the boxy
shoulders and you've got this
traditional color you've got this mock
double-breasted detail in the middle so
it's quite a smart fit but still really
professional-looking story feminine and
this style of coat comes into fashion
year after year after year
I have got a Karen Millen coat which is
a much more relaxed fit and a tie in at
the waist which is also a darker camel
coat but this is something that I've
been looking for and it's a real staple
in my wardrobe it's something that I'd
had on my wish list for a long time that
perfect camel coat and it's not
surprising at all that Rhys is a
retailer that's I went to you for my
perfect coat if you do follow me on
Instagram again you'll have seen me
wearing this absolutely loads throughout
the past few weeks this jumper from
Topshop I've worn pretty much throughout
the entire month it's got this really
lovely thick collar detail reasonably
neckline perfect if you want to sneak a
thermal underneath you will not be able
to tell it's got a slight balloon detail
on the sleeves as well so a nod to the
balloon trend but again not too OTT is
still very very wearable it's a
beautiful soft fabric just really really
scrumptious and because it is a plain
white jumper I find it so versatile and
it goes with so so many outfits in fact
my next favorite which is this suede
skirt if I've wanted to make the skirt
outfit a little bit more cozy and
comfortable I've been pairing the two
together in fact this is what I wore on
our second day in Paris just a suede
skirt and the white knit and it's a
really classic outfit both of these
things can be mixed and matched
absolutely loads it's a great price per
wear which is especially important I
think with this skirt because this was I
think 245 pounds so I really did make a
big investment with this but if you have
seen my video on how to find your
personal style
I recommended looking at the pieces in
your wardrobe that you wear a lot and
for me that is three skirts and then
perhaps investing in a more luxurious
version of that that's exactly what I
did with this one and I adore it I've
already worn it maybe 15 to 20 times in
the three or four weeks that I've had it
so already getting that price per wear
write down and once again is an
essential staple classic piece so what
we going out of fashion anytime soon
suede skirts come back year after year
and again I'll be wearing this right
through into spring one more outerwear
favorite this one I haven't actually
worn that much yet because it's quite a
thin material I'm kind of saving it up
for spring but when I've been but when
it's been a slightly warmer day or had a
thermal on this one has already had a
few outings but the reason why I just
had to include it in my favorites is
because it is such a fabulous coat 85
pounds and an amazing amazing Burberry
dupe you guys are going outfit crazy for
this already I've seen so many of you
picking this one up
it's from River Island the details of it
are absolutely perfect it's got this
very smart looking button detail
you've got the metal around the neckline
as well and I'll insert a clip of me
wearing this so that you can see exactly
how fabulous it looks when it's on the
waist belt just gives it such a
beautiful feminine silhouette and again
we have a running trend here a real
classic piece in the wardrobe this I
think is limited edition only available
online so I'll leave a link down below
along with everything else that's I
mentioned in today's video one final
fashion favorite and it is my Kate Spade
leopard print trousers I got these in
the January sale they are down from
about 200 pounds 265 once again there
are a little bit of a risk I wasn't too
sure how much I would wear them but I've
worn them loads they're already my go-to
trouser again I've been wearing them
with this jumper I'll insert a photo of
this outfit on the screen
now but because they are this really
bold animal leopard-print shade they
kind of make the outfit you don't really
need to think too much about what you
wear for the rest of the outfit because
these makes such a statement and they're
super comfortable definitely we'll be
wearing these for any long-haul flight
so I've got coming up and because
they're Kate Spade the fit is just
absolutely wonderful so I'm really sorry
they are sold out now but I will try to
find some similar options and link them
down below before we move on to beauty I
do have an accessory favorite no
surprises it's been my Aspen or trunk
bag now if you guys have followed me for
a while you may know that I also have
this in an all-over brown color and I
adore it I still use it and love it so
much but then when I saw this color
combination it's like an ivory and then
a much lighter brown I knew that I had
to have it and this once again attracts
so many conference whether I'm going out
for dinner or going to the hairdresser's
everybody wants to know about this bag
it really is a statement and a
conversation piece and another thing
that instantly uplifts your outfit this
with the Reese check coat is just
absolute perfection and I'm totally
smitten with this handbag astronaut as a
whole is a brand that I really love I
love that they are a British brand their
designs are very classic but they still
bring out new trend pieces all the time
as well it just about fits all my
essentials I'll get my vlogging camera
my phone my credit card folder and also
some lipsticks and basic makeup bits in
here not too much room left over for
spare but it does just about fit all my
essentials you can obviously carry it
just like this or what I normally do is
use the shoulder strap and wear it
crossbody so then I can be hands-free
and not have to worry about my handbag
my first Beauty favorite this month is a
perfume and it's from a brand called by
Kelly and these are super luxurious
fragrances they are definitely ones to
put on your birthday wishlist or really
save up for and save for special
occasions because this one I believe is
over 200 pounds so it is a super luxury
product but I think you do get what you
pay for with this this is woman in gold
out of all the killings that I've tried
this is my favorite fragrance it's very
grown-up
I feel very smart and very professional
when I wear this very feminine but most
of all it's such a statement fragrance
when I wear this everybody asks what am
I wearing people are so intrigued it's
an unusual sense so it's very
fascinating
people want to know more about it so
many people have got their phones out
and written it down when I've told them
what I'm wearing because it really is a
fabulous and very very memorable scent
but unlike anything I've worn before
this isn't Oh de Parfum it's a very
strong fragrance so I only use two
squirts of this usually on my outerwear
so when I'm kind of putting my coat on
I'll use this as my finishing step
before I head out the door and it just
lasts all day laughs on all my clothing
and it really is a fabulous scent
they've got a store on the Burlington
Arcade kind of opposite you have a
Crombie store just off Regent Street I
highly recommend going in there and just
experiencing a few of the fragrances by
Kilian also collaborated with a lingerie
brand called Fleur de mal this month and
they brought up the most beautiful
lingerie it is a beautiful soft blush
pink camisole top and little shorts that
you wear to bed and they are very
delicately scented with the by Killian
love don't be shy fragrance so just
again a super luxurious thing to have
perhaps a lovely Valentine's Day gift
mine is actually in the wash at the
moment obviously I'll be going on a very
delicate setting because it's silk but
it is just a fabulous fabulous
collaboration and I've been loving
wearing it to bed this month
I feel very snazzy very luxurious and
that has been another January favorite a
skincare favorite that I've definitely
spoken about before and that I've had in
my collection for a long time is the Liz
Earle super skin concentrate for night
oil but the reason why this is in my
monthly favorites this time is because I
have a new way of using this whereas
traditionally I would cleanse tone etc
etc and then use this as my final step
before going to bed I love oils my skin
just feels so nourished when I apply an
oil to my skin but now what I love to do
and this is a tip that I picked up
during a lizard facial at their flagship
on the Duke of York square is apply a
couple of pumps of this to my cleanse
and polish which of course I use morning
and night in the evenings when I want a
little bit more hydration a little bit
more radiance to my skin I pop a couple
of drops of this in with my cleanse and
polish and really massage it onto my
skin you get all the lovely benefits of
the oil it just makes it a little bit
more of a pampering experience so if
your skins bit dry or a bit stressed if
you've had a long day in town and you
feel like the pollution has got to you
then this is a really nice way of
upgrading your cleanse and polish
routine another product that's not new
to my routine but
kind of when I ran out of it last time I
kind of forgot about it and now that I
have it in my life again
I realized how fabulous it is it is the
Elizabeth Arden Super Start skin renewal
booster now this I really like because
you don't need to replace anything in
your skincare routine it's more of an
addition so when my skin is cleansed and
toned this is the next thing that I
apply I just put a couple of pumps of
this into my hand and onto my face
it helps us giving your skin a beautiful
radiance which is so important at this
time of year also helps to build up the
skin's natural barriers so your skin is
just generally all the time your skin is
better because it's better at protecting
itself against environmental aggressors
any central heating or cold weather
blemishes your skin is just better at
protecting itself thanks to the
probiotics in this but also this helps
the rest of your skincare to do its job
better so if you've invested in a lovely
serum and loving moisturizer that have
skincare benefits then this helps them
to do their job even better January for
me is a month when I really love to
pamper myself and just really indulge in
lovely skincare have some really nice
evenings where it's just a bit of me
time a bit of YouTube on Netflix and
face mask and this month I have been
obsessed with this face mask it is the
Hydra life pause away pink clay mask
from Dior now of course because it's
Dior it's super luxurious but their life
range is actually designed for
Millennials those of us in our 20s to
30s we're not quite ready for full-on
anti-aging skin care yet but we
definitely recognize the importance of
investing in skin care this is a pink
clay mask as you can see inside it's got
a very very light floral fragrance but
nothing that's going to irritate the
skin and this is one that I reach for if
I just want to have a good skin day the
next day if my skin is a little bit
irritated this has got a girl rose in
there which is really lovely and calming
for the skin but because it is a clay
mask it also works to balance out any
oil production and if you've got any
blemishes that are just lurking then
this is a really good way to calm those
down as well next up is a hair favourite
and this is from Wei haircare
I hope that's how you pronounce it I
think that's right oh you AI this is
their smooth spray and my hair is very
fine it gets very tingly it's very
colored so it needs nourishment and
detangling after I get out of the shower
this is a hydrating hair mist so it
keeps my hair lovely and nourished and
hydrated once again really important at
this time of year when our hair is
subjected to super cold weather and wind
outside and then central heating can
really dry the hair out so this
hydrating the hair is really really
important it helps keep my hair a little
bit more shiny as well it also has a
thermal protection in there so when I
blow dry my hair afterwards is a little
bit more protected it makes my hair a
lot easier to brush through because it's
hydrating and nourishing the hair and it
just generally leaves my hair really
smooth and soft afterwards so I don't
have a bad thing to say about this I've
been really enjoying using this this
month and I almost certainly be
repurchasing this when this fairly small
bottle too has run out my final Beauty
favorite this month has been my L'Oreal
steam pod I have been wanting to get
really lovely soft natural waves nothing
that looks too obviously tonged I used
it a couple of hours ago before filming
this video to get this very gentle flick
and curl towards the end of my hair and
this I find is the best way to do it
took me a long time to realize you can
actually curl with the steam pod it's
the exact same motion as if you're using
general hair straighteners but I find
that by using the steam pod as opposed
to regular irons my hair just feels like
it's much more conditioned it feels like
it's being more nourished as opposed to
being burnt when I am curling it so I've
been really enjoying using this once
again at this January and my last
favorite it's a bit of a silly one
really it is my coat hangers I get asked
a lot of questions about my coat hangers
and they are all from Primark I have
some which are kind of velvety they've
got the pink velvet on them some of
which are just plain rose gold in the
Clipper format and in the normal
triangular format and then when I went
into the store and it's usually the
bigger stores that have the lovely coat
hanger selection I spotted these pearly
ones and they are absolutely beautiful
and wanted pearl coat hangers for such a
long time so I was really really pleased
to see these in Primark so those are my
last favorites for this month so that's
it from me I really hope you enjoyed
this and monthly favourites don't forget
