me for today's video I'm going to be
going through a few of my sale purchases
that I picked up since the Boxing Day
sales most of these to be honest I
picked up in early January so I'm hoping
fingers crossed a few of them will still
be available everything will be linked
down below so hopefully you guys will be
able to pick up the bargain as well as
you might be able to tell I'm super
excited because I'm so happy with all of
these purchases they're all pieces that
I probably would have paid full price
for because I love them so much so to
get them on a discount is just amazing
lots of them are slightly more premium
premium high street from brands such as
Kate Spade Tory Burch Stuart Weitzman so
they're really good quality pieces that
I know will stand the test of time in my
wardrobe no impulse buys that I will
regret in a few weeks I hope so anyway
let's get started I'm going to first
tell you about the piece that I'm
wearing because otherwise I will forget
I saw this piece and actually tried it
on in the Kate Spade flagship in New
York and I loved it but it was just a
little bit over what I was happy to pay
for it when it was full price so when I
saw this markdown I thought you know
what it's time that I treated myself
it's mostly just a plain jumper with
these fun little tassel details down at
the bottom really easy to wear peace but
I think it's just very classic very
timeless and one that I know I will get
a lot of wear out of I bought a few
knitwear pieces from Kate Spade and it
really helped that I had seen and tried
on a lot of these pieces in the store
because it meant that I was really
confident when I was purchasing them
online on that note Kate Spade does have
a UK website and I obviously didn't have
to pay any customs or anything so buying
from them was not a problem the next
thing that I bought was this other
jumper it's a very high neck black
jumper with this gorgeous pearl
fastening detail down here which just
makes it so lovely that gorgeous
feminine touch without which it could
have been quite a plain and maybe boring
jumper but the pearls I just think adds
such a beautiful touch to this I started
wearing black a lot more towards the end
of last year I hadn't really worn it
before maybe October 2017 which I know
is totally bonkers I'm very much a cream
and pink and blush pink kind of girl but
I think that everyone needs a classic
black knit and there
to be honest I was surprised that
something so classic went down into the
sale but I'm very very pleased to have
picked this one up this next one from
Kate Spade was a little bit of a wild
card but they looked so amazing on the
model they are leather print rousers
because animal print is a print that
does not go out of style if you watch my
video on how to refresh your wardrobe
for 2018 I said that you should
potentially look at getting rid of any
outdated prints prints or really trendy
in 2017 and instead keep those prints
which are totally timeless and classic
animal print is a classic print and so I
thought I would treat myself to some
trousers these I think would look really
fun with a plain white jumper this is a
jumper that I picked up from Topshop
recently a plain roll neck I think that
could be a really really lovely outfit
combination once again a garment that I
probably wouldn't have paid full price
for but when I saw them going down in
the sale I thought it was a great
opportunity to try them and lastly from
Kate Spade again I tried this on in the
New York store absolutely fell in love
with it but wasn't willing to pay the
full price amounts but when I saw it in
the sale I snapped it up immediately
they also had loads of sizes left on the
website which really surprised me but I
think it's really fun that love the
pom-pom detail love the ruffle detail
and again a very very timeless jumper so
very very chuffed with my Kate Spade
sale purchases I mentioned in my most
warned in 2017 video one of the things I
wore the most was my Maria bikini in the
black scalloped detail I absolutely love
that bikini and I said that I had found
a Mauritius swimsuit on the net appalled
to say of this I think I saved around a
hundred pounds on so it's a really good
discount on what is a very very classic
design is the one-shoulder pink swimming
costume and I've had this on my wish
list for quite a long time
I think Marysia swimwear is absolutely
gorgeous I feel really confident when I
wear it I love the scalloped detail I
love the pink shade so much I think it
really really suits me and I'm really
excited to wear this on my upcoming
holidays next I have a little bit of an
unboxing for you I went into the Club
Monaco store on Sloane Square Club
Monaco is one of my all-time favorite
shops and I absolutely love their sales
I always find that they have really
beautiful classic pieces going down in
the sale which of course is amazing so
I'll show you what I picked up on my
latest shopping trip there
okay so this I saw on the mannequin
maybe six months ago and I went into the
store to ask for it but they'd already
sold out in the small size I was
absolutely gutted it's just a beautiful
white high neck top with gorgeous
feminine scalloped detail on the
neckline and the same scalloped detail
on sleeves and on the bottom here I
could not believe my eyes when I saw
this had gone down into sales I snapped
it up straight away it's not the size
that I would have gone for it's actually
a size medium and normally in Club
Monaco I'd be as small or even an extra
small but I thought you know what I'm
gonna try this on and pray that it fits
me and it did I have quite broad
shoulders so often when I do buy row
neck or high neck tops in a smaller size
the seam actually comes before my
shoulder if that makes sense but this it
fit me absolutely perfectly and I got it
in a sale too so I feel like it was just
absolutely meant to be and this is
probably my favorite sale purchase ever
it truly baffles me that classic
cashmere pieces go down in the sale but
they do and I'm just absolutely
overjoyed to have found this gorgeous
gray jumper it's very very plain it's
very timeless I have jumpers in my
collection from Club Monaco that I've
bought years ago again in the sale but I
still love so price per wear is just
absolutely incredible this I think will
be no different the color on this
actually stands up when you wear it so
it just gives a really lovely kind of
like fashion editor vibe if you wear a
low bun and blacked out sunglasses and
this will look really really chic slight
batwing sleeves and then you've got an
elasticated section at the bottom not
too tight just a really really beautiful
fit and something that is so classic and
a great addition to my wardrobe and
lastly this is a piece that I tried on
when I went to Club Monaco store in
Boston but I wasn't quite prepared to
pay full price for it it's an
off-the-shoulder jumper with this ruffle
detail I think is really really
beautiful the reason I think I didn't
want to spend the full amount on it was
because off-the-shoulder jumpers are
quite hard to wear do you wear a coat of
them do you worry lay it's quite hard
logistically to wear them but I thought
I'm gonna give it a go this time it was
almost a hundred pounds off it's a
beautiful soft cashmere material and
such a beautiful feminine design very
much my style so I definitely get a lot
of use out of this in at the colder
months the Ted Baker sale this year was
also in
credible a lot of the pieces that I
already own and absolutely love went
down into the sale I did do quite a lot
of alerts on my Instagram stories that a
few of my favorite pieces had gone down
so hopefully a few have you picked up
some bargains if you did see them on my
Instagram stories I also treated myself
to something in the Ted Baker sale this
was I think 120 pound down to 79 so not
major major cheap but such a beautiful
piece once again a high-neck jumper you
can tell I love that style and then it's
got this pleated detail down at the
bottom and also on these sleeves I love
this style once again is timeless it's
classic its feminine it's a kind of
thing that I will get a lot of use out
of the next part of this video I'm
actually going to be filming tomorrow
because there are a few pieces from Tory
Burch and Stuart Weitzman that haven't
arrived yet but I think they are very
nearly here so I will see you guys a
little bit later on so it's a couple of
days later now and finally we have some
new arrivals these took forever to come
and I paid for express shipping so
that's rather annoying but it'll be
worth it so these are as you can
probably guess a pair of Tory Burch
boots I've not actually seen these yet
so this is a real unboxing but having
said that I did see them in real life
when I went to the Tory Burch store on
Madison Avenue when I was last in New
York and I fell in love with them but
they were a little bit too expensive so
when I saw them in the sales it was an
instant have to add them to my basket so
here are the boots these beautiful
Anthony gray Tory Burch boots at the
back here there's a little bit of
protective foam on it at the moment but
you've got this cute little bow detail
at the back here and it's got the Tory
Burch logo on little gold charms which
is very very cute you've also got some
gold inside the heel it's these little
details I just absolutely adore when I
tried them are in New York they fit
really beautifully above the leg like
nice and clingy to your leg which again
is a style that I really like then
you've got a zip fastening here which
just makes it easier to get your foot in
the right place really low heel so these
should be very comfortable for wearing
for all day long if I'm going shopping
or if I'm abroad somewhere spending a
lot of time on my feet then hopefully
this heel height should be really
perfect for comfortable wear all day
long I will insert a little clip of me
trying these on
see how high they come up but I can
already tell that I'm going to get a lot
of use out of these hopefully these are
going to be still in stock in the sale
price because it really was such a good
bargain I think it was more than 50% off
the original price so I'm very chuffed
with these especially for such a classic
style and my final sale purchase is from
Stuart Weitzman so I have wanted a pair
of Stuart Weitzman Highland boots for so
so long I keep seeing other bloggers and
people my Instagram wearing them and
I've been lusting over them for many
many years didn't want to pay the full I
think it's nearly eight hundred pounds
so when I saw that they were almost 300
pounds off in the sale I instantly again
added them to my basket the color that I
have gone for is this beautiful brownie
color now I was really torn between the
sandy brown color or the more kind of
gray shade and then I thought you know
what with the Tory Burch ones I now have
two pairs of suede ohoo new boots
including my Karen Millen ones so I feel
I would go something a little bit
different I don't have brown over knee
boots in my collection that and they
often find myself thinking what a great
addition to an outfit they would be
including this outfit I'm wearing today
I'm planning on wearing these later on
today for their first outing after
putting some suede spray on of course I
have already tried these on and they are
a beautiful beautiful fit tied at the
top but not so tight that your leg kind
of rolls over them if that makes sense
but I will insert a clip here so you can
see what they look like with this outfit
so those are my sales purchases from the
January 2018 sales as I mentioned
everything will be linked down below
fingers crossed a few of these will
still be in stock for you guys but I
really hope you enjoyed looking through

couple more haul videos coming in

premium high street slash designer haul
