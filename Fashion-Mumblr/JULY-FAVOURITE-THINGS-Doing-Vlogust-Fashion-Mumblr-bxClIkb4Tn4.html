am hoping to film an edit and publish
this video all in one day so as you're
watching this hopefully this will have
been recorded today if that makes sense
so today's video is going to be my July
favorites and also a few thoughts about
doing vloggers so we'll get to that and
but firstly I know it's like super
cliche Marie Shay but how crazy is it
that it is actually August like I know
everybody always says that and it's like
oh how is it whatever but I actually had
to double check that my phone wasn't
broken the other day when someone told
me that it was like the 29th of July
because I feel like July was about two
days long I actually do not know where
July went so surprisingly this month's
favorites considering that I feel like
it was a two-day month are fairly broad
there's a lot of products that I really
did enjoy using this month which I'm
going to go through and but firstly
vloggers the topic of of August so I
don't even know if that's how you say it
do you say for August I don't know but I
decided at maybe midnight last night
that I may potentially do vloggers and
by that I mean a video every day during
August so let me know what you guys
think I'm putting this video live today
in case it does happen so we're on to a
good start we're doing one every day in
August and but what I will say is that
I'm not going to totally stress myself
out by doing on every single day so I
did that in May and I ended up getting
really bogged down with it I tried
really hard I think I missed maybe four
days but it really did stressing me out
especially when I was traveling so I'm
gonna try my hardest and hopefully you
guys will enjoy lots of new videos this
month it's definitely gonna be a lot
more unusual so yeah stick tight for
vloggers let me know what you think of
the idea in the comments below if you
think it's a good idea but anyway so as
I mentioned I've got quite a lot of
products to talk through for this
month's favorites
so no more rambling intro or let's get
started my first favorite I need to
mention
first because otherwise I will totally
forget to talk about it and it is my
nails so I had a shellac manicure done
at the evader hair salon in Covent
Garden three weeks ago and they are
still chip free my nails are perfectly
chip free and I just absolutely adore
this color I'm afraid I do not know what
color it is but you can see the color
there so if you were to go to the
shellac store or the Aveda store you
would probably recognize the color I
think that they've just remained so
beautifully glossy yes there's a little
bit of growth but I've never had a
manicure at last as long before and I
have been away I have been gardening I
have been cooking and cleaning and all
that jazz and my nails have remained
looking really really lovely and the
color looks super with a tan
so my nails my manicure from the evaders
straw in Cana garden on my first monthly
favorite my second favorite is fairly
random but most definitely a favorite of
this month and it is shoes by Bodom so
this pair in particular I was so much
you probably recognized them from my
Instagram's from my vlogs from outfit
videos and these are my leopard print
and gold sandals from boat and I wore
these so much this month in Mykonos in
Greece in Croatian last month and in the
UK as well I just think they're
absolutely gorgeous they're so
flattering they are incredibly
comfortable to wear and I love them but
also other shoes from bode and I have
been loving this month so bowden shoes
in general has been a favorite these I
wore around Santorini again incredibly
comfortable these ones are just like
famous on my Instagram they're just so
gorgeous I love the little pom-poms and
credibly comfortable I've been wearing
these since when did I go to Sicily like
April I think I've just been wearing
these for a really long time and still
I'm obsessed with them and I decided to
get a new pair recently and I picked up
these they are sandals again from Bowden
they've got like a rose gold back a bit
here
they have a tie up detail which is gonna
go up my leg and a white strap here so
in general Bowden sandals are my second
favorite of July and I just couldn't
make a favorite pair I love them so much
next is another fairly random favorite
and it is my Instax Mini 8 camera I
think I've got this one
in Costa Rica and I went back in January
with his plane but I've recently been
sent a couple more and I thought I would
actually put them to use so I've been
taking this around with me everywhere
but actually not yesterday but the day
before at Charlie's birthday barbecue
I left a load just hanging around the
garden for people to take snaps and they
took a lot of snap so it's just so
lovely to have all of these memories
from Charlie's BBQ there's some really
cute like action shots
there's James doing the barbecue we've
got - one of my friends passed out
upstairs a nice little selfie some of
them are a little bit overexposed
there's just so many really really
lovely photos here and just such a
fabulous way of remembering at the day
so because this has created so many
lovely memories for this month
and there's a few random ones in there
from previous previous days out I
thought I would include it in my
favourites just quite retro something
quite nice about having physical photos
and it's really brought a smile to my
face and and others faces this month so
yes my Instax camera my next favorite is
a book and this is the luxe life book
written by Fleur de force recently
bought out by Fleur I had the pleasure
of getting to know Fleur when we went to
Mykonos together this month a couple of
weeks ago and she's just such a really
genuinely lovely girl we got along so
well we bonded over our sausage dogs and
Fleur kindly sent me her book to have a
flick through and a couple of days ago
and I have not been able to put this
book down I know there are so many books
out there that kind of just tell you
stuff you already know but in a slightly
nicer way if that makes sense but this
book is not like that it is genuinely
useful and has so many ideas that you're
like oh my god
that's so easy and just things like how
to be a wonderful host at a dinner party
and also things like Pinterest Pinterest
style hacks and tips things you can do
creative wise there are so many lovely
ideas of things to do
within this book also hairstyles I'm
going to try and create this what's it
called low milkmaid braids I'm gonna try
and create this on Saturday for wedding
that I'm going to but out of all the
youtuber and blogger books that I have
ever looked through and I did actually
write a blog post on beauty kind of
YouTube books a little while ago
reviewing a few so I'll leave that down
below but out of all of them this is by
far the most useful and genuinely
readable book and on top of that it's
absolutely beautiful it's got gorgeous
Rose Bowl binding it's a very satisfying
size and weight and hardback it's just
beautiful it's lovely to keep on your
coffee table but also a really really
lovely want to read so thank you for
sending this to me Fleur I absolutely
love it and if you guys would like to
pick one up they are available now and
I'll leave a link below to where you can
buy it so that is favorite number three
for this next favorite is very luxurious
and it is a new shampoo and conditioner
from a brand called show and I've
mentioned show before I think I included
their hair oil in a favorites video
probably a month or two ago and I still
use and I'm obsessed with that oil but
recently show brought out a shampoo and
conditioner these are I need to put it
out they're very expensive I think
they're 28 pounds each which is a heck
of a lot for 200 ml of shampoo and
conditioner but they really are
wonderful or so firstly the packaging is
gorgeous you've got this beautiful sleek
black case and then this gorgeous gold
kind of glass effect a lid which is just
absolutely beautiful like this could
easily be a perfume or
any stunning beauty product it almost
feels too luxurious to put in your
shower but there's no use in saving
these things the best you've got to
actually get some use out of them but
this specifically is the repair range
for damaged hair and that's my hair is
colored it always needs any repairing
that it can get so I've been absolutely
loving using this this month the smell
is out of this world I think I mentioned
that when I was talking about that boil
this smell is just so luxurious it
really does keep your hair for you to be
scented as though you're wearing like
hair perfume for the rest of the day and
it also needs my hair really light it
doesn't feel like I've got any product
in it at all I didn't put anything in it
after shampooing it just feels
weightless which I absolutely love that
feeling I've got a lots of hair I've got
thick hair so for it to feel weightless
is just such a lovely feeling and it
really does with the show Beauty sublime
repair shampoo and conditioner so for
that reason and the fact that it's just
so darn luxurious I had to include it in
this month's favorites another hair
related favorite this month is the Dyson
supersonic hair dryer once again I'm not
going to go into too much detail about
the hairdryer because I have done a full
video reviewing the hairdryer which I
will leave down below but since filming
that video I have used this for another
two weeks or so and I have really really
been noticing the difference in my hair
it is very expensive this hairdryer is
299 pounds but I have to be totally
honest and say that I do love it it's
super lightweight it's just got all the
functions that I need it to without
going too crazy and the main thing for
me is how it makes my hair feel so my
hair is as I mentioned earlier long and
thick and often feels quite heavy and
like way down and chunky in this kind of
area but having used the dryer for I'd
say about a month now and every time
from the very first time that I dried it
my hair just felt so soft so light and
just so
weightless which is such a really lovely
feeling for your hair obviously who
doesn't want lovely soft weightless hair
so this hair try at the way that it has
made my hair feel the ease and the enjoy
ability of use and the functionalities
of this hairdryer are just taking so
many boxes for me yes it is super
expensive but I personally absolutely
love it as I said I've got loads of
information about the hair dry in my
review videos so I'm gonna leave that
link down below and go and check that
out if you'd like to see my full
thoughts on the hairdryer and also I
compare it to a 30 pound hairdryer so
one that's a tenth of the cost so go get
that video or watch after this one if
you'd like to know more about the dyson
by the way if you want to see how I
created this hairstyle I actually just
filmed a video which hopefully is going
live tomorrow so check out some more
video if you want to see how I created
these curls and with what I will leave
it there because then it's quite an
exciting product that I use to create
them next I have a skin care combination
and I'm not going to talk about this too
much because I have actually written an
entire blog post on it but I will whisk
through the product because my skin this
month has just been going really well
for me if that makes sense I'm not been
having any irregularities any bad skin
days and I think my skincare routine is
very much thanks to that and it is the
library cellular ice crystal serum
followed by the doctor's serve our
Supreme day cream and then the Sarah
Chapman's Kinesis skin insurance SPF 30
these three have been a winning
combination for me this month my skin is
utterly protected as you'll know with
these two in particular from my summer
everyday makeup routine you'll know
about the protective properties of these
and then add to that the SPF 30 from the
Sarah Chapman just such a wonderful
combination as I said I wrote an entire
blog post about these three so I'll
leave that linked down below and then
keeping on the theme of skincare another
favorite is the hydrating mist toner
from trilogy
and I really fell out of love with using
toner my skincare routine I think really
it was just a step that I felt I could
skip so
by being lazy I just cut it out of my
skincare routine and didn't use toner
for a long time but when I was currently
said this by trilogy because it's a mess
you can just so easily do it you
literally just spray it on your face no
need to wash it off no need for cotton
pads it takes a grand total of five
seconds to get it out of the cupboard
spray and then put it back in so I have
no excuse by using this my skin just
feels fresh and like invigorated it just
feels moisturized but in a controlled
way if that makes sense
I think toner is really good for
balancing out the skin so what I said
earlier about not having any
irregularities with my skincare routine
I think that's also equal to me I think
that is also partially down to this my
final three favorites are all makeup
related and first of all I have got the
ax clarence BB skin that detox fluid in
SPF 25 and I use this I think I use this
in my everyday makeup routine video in
which case I'll link it down below so
you can watch me applying this but this
has been the base that I've been
reaching for for most of the month it
does have SPF 25 which adds additional
SPF coverage to my search chapman which
I've also been using but really it's how
this leaves my skin that I have been
obsessed with I'm wearing it today so
hopefully you liked this makeup look but
really it just leaves my skin with a
beautiful glow it looks like skin the
winter I love it doesn't look like
you've caked on a load of makeup it
feels wonderful you don't feel like
you're wearing anything on your skin at
all it feels beautifully natural and
I've been applying this with a Beauty
Blender sponge which just really sets it
into your skin in a way that looks so
flawless and beautiful so in the summer
if you do want a really lovely light
base that still offers enough coverage
to conceal any imperfections then
this is a really good one to go for to
set that base down and also add a very
subtle highlight I've been using the
translucent powder do prompt their
minerals now this isn't absolutely
stunning a do-it has this beautiful
brush with it as well with the jewel
finish blush and contour brush it's kind
of double sided so got the white and the
dark side and I've been using the matte
powder to just mattify all over my face
basically specifically under the eye
area and this brush is absolutely
perfect for that I find that by setting
my concealer under my eyes it just
ensures some go anywhere but also you've
got the low powder here which as you can
see has a beautiful marbled effect to it
very similar to the outlast I might add
but this is just the most beautiful
powder that mattifies the skin but
without leaving it matte so you have a
gorgeous shine you can see on my skin
I'm not completely mattified but the oil
is under control and that is all thanks
for this powder
I've been antsy loving loving loving
using this this month and finally a
really fun the compact this one is from
Stila and I knew as soon as I open it up
that I was going to absolutely love it I
think this is probably definitely not
the first Stealer compact I've included
in a favorites video I've had i shadow
compacts that I've loved from them
before but just look at this one so many
beautiful products and here you've got a
couple of lush shades a highlight shade
and some gorgeous eyeshadow shades and I
found myself reaching for this for so
many reasons both for the eyeshadow for
the highlights for like brow bone and
all the colors in here are just so
stunning this is probably the most
usable and the most me palette that I've
ever discovered so I've been getting a
lot of use out of this this month again
it's got that ginormous lid I always say
that mirror in the lids not lid in the
mirror and it's very slim so very very
portable and I've been using this a lot
and
absolutely stunning I have nothing more
to say about that so those are all of my
favorite products from the month of July
