that now would be a really good time to
do his trimming he's taking a short
break though so let's crack on hi guys
the welcome back and thank you for
joining me for today's video it's going
to be my January favorites a little bit
later than I usually post my favorites
but that's because I wanted to get all
of my costa rica content out and dance
it was nice and relevant so hopefully
you don't mind that this is a week or so
behind schedule
but I have got a lovely selection of
products to show you today most of the
things are slightly Costa Rica related
because I can't really remember January
before that if I'm completely honest but
it also decided to add a new category
into my favorites for 2016 which is my
favorite piece of blogger mail now I'm
not sure how the reaction for this is
gonna be but basically as bloggers we do
receive some really really cool things
sometimes and I know that friends just
put in so much effort to come up with
these incredible ideas and put them into
production and send them out and I'm so
so grateful and sometimes I just don't
feel like these incredible parcels get
the credit that they're due so that's
going to be a new thing that I'm going
to try and talk about every single month
so my favorite thing that I've got in
the post from a brand so stick around if
you want to see what January's favorite
piece was but I'm gonna get started with
beauty so firstly within the Beauty
category is a new skincare product that
I've been loving I have had quite bad
skin this month I think it's a mixture
of still kind of getting into the swing
of being healthy following Christmas
maybe you're going a little bit
dehydrated and definitely kind of like
time of the month type of blemishes and
this has really come to my rescue so not
only is the product of this a favorite
but also the launch event was probably
my favorite part from Costa Rica event
of the month because V she actually
invited a small group of bloggers to an
incredible dinner at the shangri-la
hotel to tell us all about this product
and it's
beautifying anti blemish care 24-hour
hydration cream and I've been skipping
my moisturizer in favor of this on those
days and I've woken up and not have the
best skin so I've got the lighting by
the way Sun keeps coming in and out and
I don't want to draw the lines exactly
I'm really horrible lighting but this
product I've been using every single day
on those days and I have had bad skin so
I've actually got like a cluster of
blemishes around this area at the moment
and I've been applying this as opposed
to putting on a daily moisturizer and
it's really been helping helping to keep
the information down and definitely keep
the skin bacteria at bay so I think as
far as skin care goes if you are
suffering from blemishes in kind of your
20s or 30s they're necessary
specifically formulated for adult acne
so definitely recommend this one for me
it's just really helped to keep
everything calm so I've been loving
using this this month other than that my
skin here has remained pretty much the
same when I was in Costa Rica I just
kind of used little samples you might
have seen by now my get ready get beach
ready with me video where I briefly
discussed the skincare that I use before
I go on the beach but other than that no
real skincare favorites that I've
changed from last year's favourites onto
beauty though there are a couple of
things that have made their way into my
daily routine which are actually only
discovered this year but very quickly
have become favourites and the first one
is a foundation from ghulam so I
discovered this pretty much just before
I went away to Costa Rica and it's their
terracotta Jolly teint beautifying
foundation for a sunkissed healthy glow
and it's also SPF 20 so I decided to
take this one with me quite unquiet
wrist because I haven't I hadn't tried
it before I packed it in my suitcase so
I was just kind of hoping that it was
going to be really good because it was
the only foundation that I took with me
to Costa Rica and luckily the gamble
paid off because I absolutely ended up
falling in love with this so not only
was the coverage really good it gave me
a beautiful kind of flawless complexion
even on the beach even after a day of
being out in the Sun sweating working
really hard and my makeup usually would
have melted but this kept me looking
lovely and flawless and unlike many
foundations I've worn when I've been on
a holiday this actually allowed me to
tan through it so this right now is a
natural tan which for me just never
happens on my face because I always like
to wear a bit of makeup on the beach
normally I don't tan through but with
this I did so I was really really
pleased with this pleased with the long
lasting this of it pleased with the
color match even though like the girls
at the event that I picked this up from
they never met me before but the color
match is just absolutely perfect so yeah
absolutely love this one and I'm going
to keep on using this now that I'm back
home and similar story with this so it's
the Tarte rainforest of the sea
concealer from QVC and again I had only
tried this a couple of times before I
decided to take it with me to Costa Rica
and it's quite quite strong concealer so
quite heavy coverage but very very
blendable so it's a liquid concealer
with like a doe foot applicator so you
can be really quite controlled as to the
amount that you put on and I started by
putting this under my eyes and it really
just got rid of any darkness and then
when I started to get a few of these
blemishes it's a really really strong
concealer for just completely masking
over any imperfections that you might
have on your skin again the lasting
power of this really really impressed me
the packaging it's really lovely it's a
glass bottle with this kind of ombre
purple lid and everything about this I
just really enjoyed using it this month
while I was away and once again now then
back home it will definitely become part
of my daily beauty routine I wanted to
also really quickly mention a lipstick I
don't have it it's actually the lipstick
that our makeup artist gia used on us
when we were out in Costa Rica and I'm
sure the brand was Lime Crime or
something along those lines and it was a
very similar color to my white amaretto
lip creme lip crayon but almost a little
bit more of a girly pink and more of a
liquid and liquid product to apply it
onto the lips but she used that for all
the photo shoots and I absolutely fell
in love with it but unfortunately you
could only buy it in Sephora which I did
not come across him in Costa Rica but
that was an absolute lip favorite for
the month so if any of my friends are
going to a Sephora in the foreseeable
future then I will definitely
asking me asking them to pick one of
those up for me my final and beauty
favorite is this and it's a makeup brush
from Sigma now Sigma I've just always
loved their brushes but I found them
quite pricy so I really like to really
need a brush before I buy one from there
and this is their high cheekbone
highlighter in fo3 and I picked this up
because I was really struggling to find
a perfect highlighting brush and I found
the perfect highlighter I've really been
enjoying using the makeup revolution
when recently but I just didn't seem to
really get along with any of my brushes
so I went for this one and I'm pleased
to say that we finally had a perfect
match it's really lovely soft bristles
at the top just seems to pick up the
perfect amount of product and gives me
the highlight that my highlighter
deserves if that makes sense so the two
just seem to go really really well
together and I'm so pleased I finally
found a brush that lives up to the
quality of my highlighter so this is my
final Beauty favorite apart from this
I'm not really called perfume beauty but
kind of within that category and this is
the Tom Ford neroli Portofino aqua
perfume
now Tom Ford fragrances I always loved
but I always find them quite mature and
quite strong very powerful whereas this
is a lot more kind of light and fresh
compared to say black hole kid or Tom's
wooden wah and it's part of their
spring/summer range love the packaging I
mean I think you can tell from the
bottle it's so inspired by that
beautiful Italian seaside resort with
the aquamarine see-through glass bottle
it's kind of frosted with that beautiful
Tom Ford embossed called lid and the
scent is just instant kind of close your
eyes and go to holiday somewhere
beautiful Italian men everywhere it's
just one of those amazing fragrances
that it smells really familiar like it's
one of those scents I feel like I've
definitely smelt it before but because
it's a new launch I probably haven't but
it's very so hard at describing
fragrances but incredibly fresh
definitely very coastal beach like and a
lot easier to wear I'd say than other
Tom Ford fragrances which can be a
little bit overpowering but this one
absolutely fall in love with it and I
can tell already that this is going to
be my summer 2016 fragrance
so moving away from beauty and on to
fashion my first fashion favorite
possibly a little bit controversial but
it is this little lace bra from
accessorized and not just this one but I
also have this style in light pink and
whites and black and normally because
I'm a little bit smaller in that area I
tend to wear kind of padded bras but
recently I've been trying out these more
lace designs and not only are they just
SuperDuper comfortable I've been finding
I feel really kind of sexy and glamorous
without trying too hard when I've been
wearing these designs I kind of started
wearing these when I was in Germany
because the model that I was filming out
there with she had one on Jessica it's
so comfy you should try it so I picked
up a few including this one from
accessorize and they also have a similar
one from Topshop and I have just been
wearing this type of bra ever since
sorry if that's TMI but it's a favorite
so I thought I would let you guys know
and also on similar lines but at the
opposite end of the sexy scale is some
thermals so I think I've mentioned on
this youtube channel before how much I
love Marks and Spencer thermals but my
love for them just got even bigger this
month because my momma she picked me up
a few new ones including this gorgeous
neon one and it's a scoop neck which
means I can get away with most jumpers
underneath it or over the top and you
can't see it and even when I take my
jumpers off it's just this really cool
kind of neon fair isle on this ski
snowflake type print so on really really
cold days or even kind of like frosty
mornings I will just stick this on
underneath anything I like walk up to me
on the street and be like have you got
your thermal on and I probably will do
so I've been loving this one and then
also if I'm wearing anything that's not
long-sleeved I also have a really basic
gray one which I know is the most
grannyish thing ever
but it's got kind of this beautiful
brushed of fabric on the inside which is
so soft and snuggly on
and honestly this is like having a hot
water bottle on underneath your jumper
so pretty sure it's gonna get a little
bit colder before we get to spring so if
you get cold and you don't care that
it's a little bit dorky highly recommend
stocking up on max and sense of thermals
my final fashion favorite is this jumper
which I picked up from Topshop
I know it's incredibly plain item to be
including as a favorite but I have worn
this so much when I've been at home I've
just been sticking this on with a pair
of jeans and it's just the most
perfectly comfortable yet quite chic
outfit to be wearing when I'm working I
really like the low neckline as well
because I've got a nice tan to chest at
the moment it's nice to kind of show
that off a little bit and I just find
that this is a very flattering shade of
gray I was gonna wear it for this video
but I actually have a little bit of
makeup on it so I just got it out the
washing basket to show you which is a
little bit gross but there we go
and this was really not that expensive
at all from Topshop and so far is
probably the best value for money per
wear item in my wardrobe next thing that
I have been loving this month is this
which is my Fujifilm Instax Mini 8
camera and we were given these by the PR
team of piss bling where we in Costa
Rica to take a few holiday snaps and the
absolute did went crazy took so many
lovely photos on the beach and I just
thought it was such a retro and fun idea
and just having all these Polaroids is
such a lovely way of keeping your photos
no getting lost down in your Instagram
grid or back in your Facebook profile
but it's just so nice to have something
physical which I feel like we don't we
don't have enough physical photos these
days so I think I'm gonna collect a load
of these and put them in a scrapbook and
also it's my friend
Hannah's birthday a couple of nights ago
I took this out with us and we just took
a load of photos while we're getting
ready and while we are out and it just
was so much fun just something as simple
as an old-school Polaroid camera just
gave us so much excitement it was just
so nice to have these memoirs in the
evenings so this is a quite random
favorite of January and then speaking of
that night out I wanted to include this
little bag from Zara in my favourites
because it's just so cute and pretty
absolutely love that
kind of brown sewing material with this
gunmetal grey feather but I well
obviously I have including its I'm
talking about it now but I kind of take
it back a little bit because it's quite
hard to close when you are out and about
and sadly my credit cards and debit
cards and driving license got stolen
from this while I was out with the girls
so not sure whether this deserves a
feature in my favorites but there we go
I mentioned it but on a brighter note
another bag which I've been loving is
this one which is my dupe for the Chloe
fate handbag I picked this up from a
website in America I actually wrote a
whole blog post on why I like to buy
cheap handbags dupes versus investment
stoops versus fakes so if you are
interested in that kind of topic then I
will leave that blog post down below but
this I thought was a really lovely kind
of dupe for the Chloe fate without being
too much of a copy obviously it doesn't
have any faux banding on it so it's not
a fake handbag but whether it's a Jeep
or not I actually just genuinely really
like the style of this bag it's quite
spacious on the inside it's got this
really big compartment and then the
zippy pockets let me know if you'd like
me to do and updated what's in my
handbag and I shall do that for you and
then it has a lovely long strap which
perfectly goes over the shoulder and
because it's not a huge bag it means I
purposely don't take it too much stuff
around with me so I don't end up getting
shoulder ache which is good news and so
lastly what I mentioned before is my
favorite blogger mail item of this month
and for January 2016 I'm including my
glam slam and board game from soap &amp;amp;
Glory so I haven't actually had a chance
to play with this yet but I thought it
was such a fun idea and they've
obviously put so much effort into
creating this so what's inside the box
is this matte which is kind of the
playing board and I guess you go around
rolling a dice choosing some challenges
and then you win little bits of soap &amp;amp;
Glory make up a surprises as well as the
board there is a pack of cards which
helps you move your way around the board
so you roll a dice as little pink dice
which came with
and then you pick up a card and you
either collect or potentially lose a
make up item and also a box are a
collection of little mini maker products
from soap &amp;amp; Glory so the aim is to get
around the board and collect as many
make up pieces as possible you've also
got this little phone which delivers
messages telling you whether you've won
or whether you need to give something
back so I just thought that was a really
good fun idea and a really nice way of
introducing yourself and your friends to
a few new launches from soap &amp;amp; Glory so
I just think it's a really really super
fun idea and I can't wait to play this I
think I'm going to take it up to
Scotland with me next weekend so I can
play it with the girls so thank you so
much soap &amp;amp; Glory it's such a really
lovely idea
and I'm very excited to play it and that
is it those are my absolute favorite
things of January 2016 hope you guys
have enjoyed my first favourites of the
year let me know if you like the idea
including my favorite blogger mail and
if you really like it then maybe I could
do some like unboxing because I just
think that as time goes by brands are
just doing better and better giveaways
and events and those kind of things it's
so nice to share them with you because
it's such a shame that sometimes it's
only on snapchat or only like a quick
tweet to say thank you when really some
of the things are so spectacular they
really do deserve more of a mention so I
thought I'd stick that in there let me
know if you like that idea do let me
know also what you have been loving this
month because I'd love to know what kind
of products or experiences or clothing
you guys have been enjoying and yeah so
