joining me for another video I hope
you're all having a really super week so
this is my first haul video of 2017
feels like quite a momentous occasion
and it also feels like quite a long time
since I last did a whole video on this
channel so I hope that this one doesn't
disappoint this is going to be my first
of 2 January sales haul videos and the
reason why I've decided to split them
into two is because we're first looking
I did buy quite a lot as you can imagine
I love a good bargain and also because
there's quite a divide between what I've
been buying so this one is going to be
more affordable pieces high street
stores such as a sauce we've got some
Topshop we've got Jack Wills you've got
stationery like Kiki K so those kind of
price brackets and then the video that
I'll be uploading next time is going to
be my premium high street and designer
version so if you don't want to miss out
on that one then please hit that
subscribe button if you haven't already
thank you so much if you have it means a
lot to me if you just click that button
and if you do then you won't miss my
next haul so having said what I said
about this Omega High Street I'm going
to get started with the most expensive
item in this haul as I picked up all the
more affordable side things just because
well you'll see what I mean in a second
it didn't really fit into either video
so I thought I'd just get started with
it and it is this suitcase which is from
a brand called bricks and with this oh
my gosh how am I going to show you this
I might have to insert like an overlay
of me holding it in its full glory
because I can't really show you but it
does have this padlock combination on it
which is just really snazzy it looks
really beautiful it's pink so I just
fell in love with it straight away I'd
actually seen this on the Instagram of
an American Instagrammer though follow
her name is Jessie and her Instagram is
the darling detail love her Instagram
I've been obsessed with her for quite a
long time and I think she has the full
set of these and for that I'll be
forever in awe but I
she bought this one thinking it was
going to be a cabin size bag so one that
could go in the overhead compartment and
it was definitely labeled as that so I
think they might have sent me the wrong
one but I'm not gonna complain because I
think I would actually get a lot more
use out of one that is this size however
if I go back on the website and see the
smaller one is still on sale I might get
that one as well
so pick that one up with this and
everything else I'm going to leave the
full price and the sale price what I
paid down here so you guys can see what
I saved and that I paid for and with
absolutely everything as always in my
videos it's going to be linked down
below I did buy this all about a week or
so ago so if anything is left in the
sales that you want to pick up then
hopefully fingers across you guys it's
still in stock also from bricks which by
the way I think is an Italian company I
think they're Italian made I think they
all came from Italy but I ordered these
about six days ago I don't have any
customs or anything so that was all
absolutely fine I also got the travel
sleeve which is basically like a classic
plastic cover which goes on top of your
luggage and it stops it getting damaged
I think when you have a suitcase as
fabulous as that you'll probably be a
little bit worried that it might get a
bit battered up in the hold and so I
thought that I think this was about 20
pounds was a good investment as well and
then this I think was a free gift with
purchase because it was always in my
shopping cart it had $99 on it but it
didn't charge me like it was always in
the shopping cart and it is this Navy
tote bag it looks a little bit like a
long-long Machamp bag and my mum's been
lusting over Zhongshan bags for a little
while so I'm gonna give this to my mum I
don't know if it was just a fluke and
their website was doing something funny
but this was free so I'm not gonna
complain okay so that rather random
little Edition out the way now this is
probably what you guys came for more
fashion pieces so I'm gonna kickstart
the fashion part of this hall with
Topshop by the way yes my tree is still
up Charlie and I like to leave our tree
up until well obviously the last day to
take it down as like January the 6th and
today is the 3rd so I've got a few more
days until I have to take it down before
you know the battle
and all that so yeah that's why the tree
still up anyway
Topshop actually I'm gonna unpackage
these lists for time purposes oh yes yes
yes
so this oh my gosh this is so soft this
is a beautiful pink jumper and this
material feels like cotton candy it
feels so soft it's a beautiful baby pink
color
I feel like this may have been full
price because I think its new collection
but even then it's only 24 pounds and
this is the kind of thing that I will
absolutely live in I work from home as
you probably know so I live in
loungewear this is so perfect for
traveling as well as one of these just I
wish you guys could feel this it's so
soft yeah I will get a lot of use out of
that for 24 pounds that's absolutely
fabulous I don't think this was in the
sale either
I'm currently worrying that she'll even
get anything in the Topshop sale but
let's just go through it anyway so this
is a beautiful purse I thought this just
looked really chic and very high-end
actually it's only 25 pounds it's got
these beautiful studs around it which
I've got pearls and then little gold
studs good size it's also got a zippy
section and then a main section and this
golden shoulder strap as well just
thought that was really nice everyday
handbag for just you know elevating your
outfits another pink jumper this one is
not quite such soft material more of
like an everyday style but it does have
these holes in the shoulder so don't if
you can see there it's is really cool
kind of off the shoulder but not quite
if that makes sense but I actually
picked this up because I feel like the
opposite shoulder trend isn't really
going anywhere I love the color of this
and this is something a little bit more
unusual than your everyday jumper next I
have this beautiful jumper another
variation just a way of elevating your
everyday kind of casual clothing this
one is a very very wearable gray color I
think it looks fabulous on everybody and
then you can see this beautiful ruffle
detail with the white edges on the
ruffling I think this will look
absolutely gorgeous for the pair of
white jeans and over-the-knee boots I
think this is just going to be such a
stylish piece that you can wear in so
many ways really looking forward to
wearing this one and I think it might be
quite a popular kind of Instagram alert
IP
as well this detail just looks so
high-end somehow really really excited
to give that a try then I picked up this
high neck top also from Topshop it's in
this baby blue kind of dusky blue color
and the reason why I picked up is
because I just love these ruffle details
and it has a ruffle detail on the sleeve
edges and then on the collar as well
I've been such a fan of this ruffle
collar so many people that I know have
also picked up the Karen Millen one that
I've been wearing a lot recently which
by the way also an interstellar but I
think it's sold out now this one was 16
pounds whereas the Karen Millen one was
over 100 so this is a bit of a bargain a
really lovely piece for layering and
then I picked up another pair of Topshop
jeans I really loved the wash of Topshop
jeans I think they look really high-end
and also these ones have a very scragga
D you ripped up hems they're really cool
design detail I think the detail on the
hems is a trend that's not going to be
going anywhere this year so I thought
these would be really cool especially
with a pair of boots especially a power
trim to be showing you guys in a few
minutes
and also if you've got any meals that
you're not afraid of freezing your feet
off by wearing then that's a really cool
hem detail to wear with that kind of
shoe and then finally from Topshop I
picked up a pair of shoes these also
would go really well with those jeans
because I think they're the kind of shoe
you can wear as an everyday piece
because of this strap and the heel
height and the fact that it's a chunky
heel so these are described as almost
like mary-jane type shoes I really love
this flared heel shape I think this is
going to be a trend we're going to be
seeing a lot of in the upcoming months
so that's everything that I got from
Topshop I'm really sorry if none of that
is actually in the sale I guess I bought
it during the sale period so that's why
it works out in this haul but the rest
of the things I'm going to talk to you
about in this video are on sale I
promise ok let's move on to a sauce a
sauce had an amazing sale this January
and I think actually started on Boxing
Day or even Christmas Day how crazy is
it that so many sales started on
Christmas Day I have to admit I did buy
a few things from net-a-porter on
Christmas Day a little gift to myself
which you guys will see in the next
video but going back to a sauce I picked
up
firstly a couple of jumpers these two
jumpers I feel like they could be from
Rhys that's the kind of style that they
are and I've already tried them on and
they look so lovely this one I just
adore the color if you saw my video on
Wednesday about 25 things that you don't
need in 2017 which I'll leave link down
below then you might have seen that I
was wearing this one this was on offer
on a sauce it was a really good price
and I just love the color I love the
chunkiness of it it's so warm it's so
good for just bundling up in and being
so warm and cozy which at this time of
year being cozy is very high on my
agenda so love that one and then equally
this cream one it's not exactly the same
it has a different kind of knit pattern
on it but also really high neck it looks
so similar to my Rhys one which I will
insert a photo up here but once again a
fraction of the cost it's not quite as
long as the Rhys one but if you wear
high-waisted jeans you could just kind
of tuck the front into the high-waisted
jeans and this would be such a lovely
look really nice knit really nice color
and even better price and then finally
from ASOS I thought it's hair of boots
if you follow me on Twitter then you
won't be surprised to see do I picked up
the Chanel tube boots that everyone is
going crazy about when I tweeted because
I mean the absolutely gorgeous these do
look very similar to the Chanel and boot
style which is kind of why I picked them
up they're not a copy but they are
definitely inspired by it this will
absolutely make jeans white jeans denim
jeans even black jeans look seriously
cool but also if you've got any midi
dresses any like suede skirts
these are just going to really give that
designer edge to any outfit I hope these
are still available and that you guys
can buy them I will as I said leave
links down below fingers cross they're
still there because I'm pretty sure you
guys are gonna love these as much as I
do
and I haven't worn them yet but I mean
they're ankle boots they look really
lovely quality perfect heel height for
walking around all day in so I think I'm
gonna get so much use out of these ok
just whizzing through the last pieces
now have some conscious of the length of
this video the next thing that I picked
up was this pajama set from Bowden I
just love pajamas and I feel
like I want to get rid of loads of old
pajamas because we spent half of our
lives in bed so I feel like pajamas are
something that we should invest a little
bit more effort into finding nice ones
so when I saw these on Offutt I thought
I would pick them up I think Bowden have
an additional 10% off their sale now I
hope it's still on but yeah I'll leave
these link down below it's a cream
material really lovely soft stretchy
material with gold polka dots and it's a
long sleeved shirt and then also long
bottoms as well I really wanted to film
this video today so I can wear these
tonight what I would say is if you're
between sizes definitely go down I
normally wear a size 6 the smallest they
had was small and these look pretty huge
don't remind because they're pajamas but
yeah if you're wondering what size I
would say go down next I went to the
Jack Wills website and I love shopping
Jack Wills and sale don't really like
paying full price for it because I feel
like I'm getting a little bit ripped off
but in the sale I love it so first thing
I picked up was this pair of just plain
grey tracksuit bottoms as I said working
from home in January requires lots of
lovely comfy wear I have a couple of
pairs like this from super dry but both
of them have got holes on them holes in
them or paint on them so I'm gonna chuck
those out and wear these instead they're
quite slim fitting so quite flattering
and they're very like dancer ish they're
not sloppy I just thought they were
really really lovely quite plain but
great for wearing with one of those
chunky jumpers then I picked up a box
set of their boy pants I feel like
everybody needs a few pairs of
comfortable knickers in their underwear
drawer and Jack Wills ones I just really
love me quite a nice suit material thick
really soft material having the 3 in
this box set made them a really good
price and then obviously they had the
sale discount on top so if you've not
seen Jack Wills knickers before I'll
just get one pair out with knowing show
knickers like this on my channel but hey
go they're just like playing knickers
so if you just want to have some
comfortable underwear on then you can't
really go wrong with these and then
finally a flannel pair of a tracksuit
bottoms or pyjamas actually a rather
they have more dramas and tracks
Awesome's these are just that kind of
really cozy soft material that if you're
having a pajama day they work absolutely
wonderfully if you like to be really
warm and snuggly in bed or if you just
like to wear something a little bit more
casual when you're relaxing at home so
you come home from work and you don't
like to you know put your pajamas on the
Straits where you could wear these as
like house trousers and then they have
JAC wheels on the inside of the
waistband as well so all of these one
special offer discounted in the January
sales from Jack Wills last but not least
I did a little bit of January sales
shopping on the quitaque website their
discounts were absolutely amazing some
things that even up to 80% off so I have
stocked up ready for next Christmas I
picked up some wrapping paper I covered
the exact prices but I'll leave them on
the screen if I can remember them or if
I can find them these are just three
rolls of wrapping paper really lovely
designs which let's be honest they're
not going to be any less popular next
year so really good idea to get
Christmas bits and bobs in the sales
also again crazy discounted I got a set
of Christmas cards these are just got
hearts on them or bullet balls or trees
or presents ten cards I think they
worked out like a pound of card it's not
laughs and then there are some single
cards I think again these are about a
pound reduced from around three pounds
fifty more single cards because you know
if you want the right to store them you
might as well get them in the sale these
are gift tags I always end up spending a
fortune on gift tags around Christmas so
I've picked up a ten pack in the sale
this is another Christmas card a little
box of tape this is like washi tape I
just find it so much quicker and easier
and it looks really cute with craft
paper if you use special Christmas tape
I also picked up this set of gift bags I
think this was reduced to under a pound
a bag so if you've got any weird shaped
items that you don't want to wrap or if
you're in a rush or if you just don't
have the skills of wrapping and then the
gift bags are really lovely idea I also
got some Christmas
Sheetz for those sort of gifts what you
don't want to necessarily add a whole
tag but you need to know who it's for
then Christmas stickers are a great idea
and these last few pieces are little
note Oh a little gratitude list that's
really cute that's such a good idea so
this is just a you know name and what
they bought use that's a really good
idea from Quique I think that's just a
freebie and the thing that I dropped was
another Christmas card so that's
everything that I got from Kiki K and
that also rounds up my haul of more
affordable pieces that I picked up in
the January sales and then that random
tops recorder in there as well I wants
again I'm so sorry I thought there were
some so pieces in that I think actually
is all just new in so I heard you guys
enjoyed looking through this haul with
me and if you are excited to see what I
picked up from the more higher end
stores I shop from places like Reis Club
Monaco Tory Burch and then a few treats
from net-a-porter as well and as I said
earlier please do subscribe so that you
don't miss that or any of my future

January sales let me know what your
favorite sales purchase was down in the
