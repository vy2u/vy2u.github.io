my dog is in right now I'm gonna take a
photo and show you this is genuinely
what Dexter is looking like on the floor
right now so I'm gonna try and
concentrate even though I have a
pornographic dog right here next to me
hi guys and welcome to my January River
Island and Topshop haul i say January
River Island and Topshop haul or so
that's the thing but really January's
for these month where I should not be
shopping but I don't know new year new
me new wardrobe not really sure what
happened but I got really really
spending a couple of days ago and I
thought I would show you what I picked
up in case you are in the mood for
shopping or maybe you're completely
bankrupt like I am and just want to live
through me and my shopping whatever you
want to do via I did pick up quite a few
things none of which were really
necessary but all of which I really
really liked and as much as I'd like to
believe I'm going to send half of them
back I'm probably not so yeah I think
I've got a really nice selection of
pieces or kind of pastel colors so I'm
telling myself that they'll be really
good to spring the pieces as well so I'm
gonna get started with the river island
pieces because they are on top of the
pile first thing that I got is this
really really hard to show you but it's
a very kind of natural stony grey
coloured trench coat not trench coat at
all it's like a poncho with a waist belt
but I haven't taken the belt off yet but
it's got a gold buckle you can kind of
see there gold buckle hopefully I'll
insert clip of me wearing it so you can
see it a lot more clearly and but
basically I tried on a cape like this
during Fashion Week I borrowed one from
the apartment and I just really really
loved how it fits and I thought this
would be quite nice almost like a spring
alternative and the colors are really
lovely they go with my new blog theme
which is always the consideration and
and yeah I thought this would look
really nice with maybe a pair of white
jeans and some boots
it was 55 pounds so not cheap but not
that expensive when you think of what
some winter coats and cover-ups can cost
so
I think it'll be quite a versatile piece
nice to chuck over a lot of different
outfit types and make them a little bit
more dressed up you know make it look
like you've made a little bit more
effort than just sticking on any old
coat
so yeah this lovely trench why do I keep
saying trench poncho I think it's a
poncho or a kimono that was the first
thing that I picked up next I picked up
this skirt which is just absolutely
beautiful my obsession with suede skirts
is far from over and they also have a
little bit of a thing for tassels as you
guys know and this just really ticked
all the boxes I absolutely love this
color gray I think it's so flattering I
think on blonds it's just really really
lovely on brunettes equally as lovely
wherever your hair color this was 35
pounds which i think is just amazing
considering the amount of detail and it
really is a supersoft suede holy face
weight but then I thought that about my
last River Island skirt and it was
actually real suede so who knows I will
leave a link to in the description box
if you want to check out the fabric
content or I could just do it now can't
find the label but I will leave all the
information down in the box down there
but yeah 35 pounds I thought this is a
really good bargain I think I'll
probably wear this with black tights and
black ankle boots maybe even put a
jumper with it tuck the jumper in I
thought that would look really really
lovely and quite a nice way to dress up
just like a normal or tunnel day or oh
my god
I need to Nutella coffee it's not
automatic they're nice kind of wintery
waltz spring day definitely one that's
gonna see me through into the springtime
so yeah I thought 435 pounds this was
really really nice
love the tussles love the shape as well
it's kind of like a chevron chevron
tassel shape so anybody pleased with
that one okay I've just made myself a
nice cup of coffee so hopefully I'll be
a little more alert and stop making
silly mistakes so let's try again so the
next thing that I picked up from Ireland
was this cute little bikini and it's
just a plain black top where the school
just kind of like lace detail you've got
almost like a floral quite thick lace
design which i think is quite unusual I
like there to be a little bit of detail
in bikinis because then the eye is drawn
more to the bikinis
what's underneath it let's say and I've
just found out that I am going away for
a little bit of winter sunshine in a
couple of weeks so this is going to be a
little bit of inspiration to get into
that bikini body shape which I'm very
much lacking after the whole Christmas
period I thought black would probably be
the most flattering and also the bottoms
are quite nice as well I think I've
mentioned in a previous video that I
really don't like when the bottoms at
the back of the bottoms are too big
because then you kind of look like got a
bit of a soggy bottom and you don't get
tan lines or you don't get a nice tan
line on your bum so these are as you can
kind of see quite a small bottom if that
makes sense and then they've got this
nice lace detail on the sides so thought
they'd be quite nice for my little trip
the tan lines will be a little bit weird
especially with the top I'll probably
end up with kind of like a checkered
pattern on the front so this might end
up being one of those afternoon bikinis
when you're done tanning for the day and
just want to pose on the beach also with
the said trip to winter Sun and I picked
up a couple of pairs of sunglasses now
these ones I'm not even ashamed to say
are the biggest Dior dupes
ever I know there's all these kind of
fake ones on the internet but these are
from Ravana's they're not technically
fakes but very much inspired by those
deal sunglasses which we all saw all
over Instagram feeds during summer I'm
not 100% sure if they suit me but can't
really see while I've got them on so
hard to see like I don't know what it is
for the different lighting I might use
the one keeps anybody up smooth so that
is a monkey just me but yeah I thought
they were quite nice with the turtle
Tuerto oyster shell and cheap as chips
compared to the Dior ones at least and
then these I picked up because I
absolutely love the color of these these
were 14 pounds and the dear ones they
gained 14 pounds and these have got a
really lovely color they're kind of like
a pinky brownie topi kind of shade and
then almost like a snakeskin pattern on
the band which I thought was quite
lovely it's gained they're pretty big so
good for those tired mornings maybe
after I got off the airplane they'll be
good for that and the last thing that I
picked up from River Island sadly I
think this is gonna go back because it
just
kind of didn't look as nice as it did on
the website but let me know what you
guys think if and it says humbag so it's
got this lovely kind of stone colored
page down at the bottom snakeskin at the
top and then you've got this little gold
bar so a long shoulder strap and then
inside which is the magnetic clasp it's
quite big but I'm not sure I just didn't
fall in love with it as as much as I
thought I would and I don't know let me
know what you guys think leave me a note
in the comments keep or an or not keep
but I'm not 100% sold on this it was 28
pounds so a real bargain thing River
island are doing really well when it
comes to handbags at the moment
especially the quality for that amount
of money is really really good but I did
also buy a bag from Topshop which you'll
see shortly so yeah stick around and let
me know which one you think I should
keep so moving on to Topshop I can feel
the coffee kicking in now so hopefully
this is not going to get too crazy and
the first thing that I picked up from
Topshop was this skirt and I had it in
my head but I actually owned this skirt
not this exact one obviously but it's
good very similar to this a couple of
years ago and then I don't know what
happened to it I seem to have this in my
wardrobe I even learn things to friends
or I leave them places I leave at my
mom's house or I don't know where my
clothes disappear to but yeah I'm pretty
sure I have um something like this
before and I used to wear loads with
black tights little ankle boots and
maybe a black or white roll neck tucks
in with a statement jumper pretty sure
the skirt that I had before is actually
from Zara um slight Rumble aside so this
is Topshop petite little leopard print
skirt it's quite nice thick almost like
a jacquard matera which I really really
like this little bit warmer and it keeps
its shape pretty well and I just think
it looks quite elegant 34 pounds and I
think it's one of those that I really
will get a lot of use out of especially
in springtime as well so yeah if this
fits then this is definitely going to be
a keeper now this is going to be really
hard to show you on camera without me
doing my close-ups but the next thing I
got is this absolutely stunning coat now
I'm not going to get it too close to my
face because makeup on this is not going
to be good but I just thought the shape
of this was so stunning it's this
gorgeous material which has got kind of
like a raw edge to it if that makes
sense and then it's got rose gold
detail on the buckle and on the little
clip on the inside there and it's quite
hard to describe I think I'd almost call
this like a doctor's apron kind of
finishes a cross over a little rose gold
buttons there yeah cross over hem on the
top there and then you've got this kind
of cutoff waist section a waist belt
again with the rose gold but to be
honest I just absolutely fell in love
with the color of this light pink this
kind of pink is my favorite color and
it's got the rose gold on the zip as
well I just saw all the details on his
coat where absolutely stunning a really
nice kind of special occasion coat as I
said that before I don't really have a
special coat I've got like normal trench
coats or fluffy coats or kind of you
know just women coats but nothing really
for a special occasion like if I have a
wedding or like for a skort if I go to
the polo or anything in the summer this
was a hundred and ten pounds so not
cheap but I think it's quite a timeless
style and yeah I'm really looking
forward to Angus in the winter so you'll
probably be seeing this in quite a lot
of outfit of the days I just found one
more bit from revive event which totally
got hidden underneath the Topshop pile
but this also for what my little holiday
is a lovely light crack kind of material
top but also really good for layering at
this time of year as well I find that
right now it's still quite mild and so
you layer up and then you get so hot you
just want to take all your layers off
half the time I'm left with just a
thermal underneath which is not a good
look so I almost bought this half for
layering and half of my little holiday
but I thought it's a really lovely
detail just have this little tie
fastening if it's what you call it kind
of a little clasp with a I've got one of
these things I'm finding it really hard
to describe this it's a squeezy metal
thing which means you can adjust the
tightness of these completely useless
bits on the neckline but either way I
thought is a nice little detail and love
white vest
whenever I have them in my wardrobe I
find they are amongst my most worn
pieces and this one was 28 pounds I mean
not cheap but not mega expensive as I
said it's one
those things that pretty much last all
year round it's never going to go out of
style you do have to be careful not to
get any makeup on it though I'm really
conscious I've probably got makeup on my
fingers because I can already see a
little bit of makeup on these dangly
bits so gonna put that down
next up something a lot more practical
and this is a burgundy ox bloody wine
colored jumper from Topshop and I
actually have this exact style in white
as well and what I really like about it
is the sleeves it's got an almost fluted
detail on the sleeves and really high
neckline so what I do in the winter is I
put a thermal underneath that I have so
many thermals I've told him so many
times from Marks and Spencers that are
kind of scoop neck three-quarter sleeves
so they go absolutely perfectly under
things like this and I just love roll
necks and high necks I think that's so
cozy they're the kind of things I just
wear on an everyday basis at this time
of year and I'm sure it's gonna get
colder at some point so I'm sure I will
get a lot of use out of this and the
color is just a little bit more unusual
than the blacks or greys or whites that
seem to be filling up my wardrobe so
really pleased with this one but because
you can never have too many gray roll
necks in your wardrobe I also picked up
a gray one I have got a million grey
well next I just thought this one was a
little bit different to ones that I
currently own it's got a kind of
slightly tighter section at the bottom
and then um elasticated hands on the
sleeves so I think it should be quite a
nice fit very loose and baggy but the
color I think is a really nice color on
any skin tone any hair color really
really easy to wear and I think this is
going to be one of those that are not
only will I be wearing in the house and
I'm working from home but also if I just
got like quite casual meeting or
anything in town with a nice statement
nap cause I thought this would look
really really lovely but it's just one
of those things that's so easy to wear
easy to check on you know you're gonna
look quite chic you know not not going
to be doing anything too crazy the next
couple of things which I got our two
bodies now these are the ones which are
roll neck long sleeve and then at the
crotch area they've got this kind of
pressed hood popper thing going on which
I've never actually owned before I've
never owned any
Prester to crotch things but I think
they make so much sense as I said with
my thermal wearing the only annoying
thing is having to tuck them in all the
time whereas with this it's always going
to be tucked in so if I'm wearing maybe
with my nice little pretty skirt I want
you to worry about it becoming untucked
because I would be all fastened in at
the crotch which is great
these were 18 pounds each they're really
not that expensive but I thought really
great to win two layers I picked this up
in black and gray and from the super
practical to the rather more unpractical
the next thing that I got from Topshop
was this burgundy
faux suede play suit which I thought was
just a really unusual thing I don't have
too many fun unusual things in my
wardrobe as you might be able to get
some arrests this video it's mostly
quite practical pieces but I thought
this would look really lovely maybe with
a roll neck underneath during the winter
season black tights little ankle boots
and again really really love the color
so yeah I'm not sure I'm just going to
look like on I will insert a clip here
but I thought I would give this a try
then we have another piece of knitwear
surprise surprise you can never have too
much of knitwear in your winter wardrobe
and this I just absolutely fell in love
with the color I'm not sure if you can
actually see but it's got almost purple
and cream strikes going through it which
is a really really nice detail and it's
got a rose gold sip down the back which
just gives it a little bit of extra
something that's special and the final
bit of clothing that I got from Topshop
is this very plain gray v-neck jumper
now this I wore in my 5 minute makeup
routine which you guys might have seen
on Wednesday and it's one of these
things again I feel like I've said it
for everything in this video but I can
just wear it at home stick it on it's a
very classic chic piece I wasn't too
sure about the v-neck normally I prefer
the high necks but sometimes you want to
be warm but you don't want to be too
kind of bundled up in this area like I
really am right now I'm overheating with
the lights but a v-neck is just a
slightly more casual option if you wear
a nice delicate necklace and it looks
really beautiful but I actually fell in
love with the particular shade of grey
that this jumper is if that makes sense
I think it's really flash
it's my skintone and then it's got this
nice really not sure if you can see but
this side of it has got a different
direction to the fabric which just gives
a little bit more of an unusual design
detail and yeah it's very light it's not
too thick material but it's still a
jumper so it's still nice and cozy when
you're at home and then last but not
least I picked up this bag from Topshop
not gonna lie to you I picked it up
because I thought it looked a little bit
like those Chloe bags that we're seeing
all over Instagram feeds but not so
similar that it's kind of like a dupe or
copying them or anything but it's got
lovely suede bottom a little tassel with
the ring detail and then a faux
snakeskin material up at the top you've
got the shoulder strap I haven't
actually taken the insides out and then
a little zipper pocket on the inside too
so nice and secure but I don't think the
trend for saddlebags is going anywhere
this winter or even springtime so I'm
sure I get a lot of use out of this and
it's reasonably big as well it's quite
white so I'm sure my carol will fit in
here and my purse on my phone and a
little makeup bag so that's pretty much
all that I need and that's everything so
as you can see quite a practical haul in
most places loads and loads of knitwear
I definitely don't need to buy any more
knitwear ever again let me know if I
said that in my last haul video because
I probably did and didn't listen to
myself but also few really fun piece as
well and the jacket I'm really really
pleased with the bikini
I am almost dreading try it on as I said
but yeah go go to have a little bit of
inspiration to get our beach party back
so hope you guys have enjoyed looking
through all these pieces with me as I
said I'm going to be leaving the links
