I'm doing my June favorites and I'm
going to be mixing fashion and beauty
into one video I know normally or in the
past two videos that I've done with the
favorites I've done Beauty but I
actually didn't have a huge amount of
Beauty favorites to do a whole video so
I'm going to do fashion and beauty and a
couple of other random things I have
been loving this month so it is June all
thinking about some holidays or going on
some holidays all have been on small
holidays so summer holidays is kind of a
bit of a running theme here first thing
I'm going to talk about is this which I
was currently sent from triangle
I was also some bottoms but the top is
prettier it is basically they're new
from their new crochet collection which
i think is probably going to be
love/hate this summer we're probably
gonna see all over right Instagram feeds
I personally really really love crochet
I wore a really cute crochet top when I
was in Seville a couple of weeks ago I
think the colors are just really really
cute this is almost like a Barbie
turquoise and Barbie kind of pinky
purple and it just looks really nice
with the white it's probably not going
to be the most tan accentuating colors
but still it's just like you know one of
those things they look amazing in
pictures I'm sure all of our Instagram
feeds are going to be clogged up with
people wearing triangle bikinis over
summer and sorry not sorry I'm gonna be
one of them because I love this I can't
actually remember if I mentioned this in
last month's favorites I probably did
because it definitely was a favorite
thing last month but maybe last month's
favorites was Beauty anyway so it's the
Olympus PEN camera which I got from John
Lewis and sorry if I mentioned it before
but I am just still obsessed and in love
with this camera I also got the 45 mil
lens which creates those beautiful
blurry background pictures it's got the
flip out screen so you can do your vlogs
from your selfies and everything else it
does wireless so it connects to your
phone you don't even need her Wi-Fi
connection you can just get the pictures
straight on your phone and it's just got
so many of these little details that
make it such
camera it's so easy to take good
pictures loads of my Instagram pictures
recently have been taken on the Olympus
PEN and absolutely loved it I did a
little blog post on the photography
equipment that I use whether it's a
camera that I'm vlogging on now or
cameras that I take photos my blog for
so if you want to read more about the
Olympus PEN and my thoughts on it and
some comparisons against other cameras
then I'll leave post below another
random one you might have seen my home
where home video or my homework or blog
post but basically this mug from
Anthropologie I've featured in that
video and I have been loving using this
mug or cup I don't know what you call it
it's got these really cute little feet
it's got three feet which it stands on
which I just think it's so adorable and
I always feel really proper when I'm
using it it's almost like you have to be
upright and have your pinky out to use
it it's really hard not to spill I do
find my tea sometimes splashes over so
it's not the most functional of mugs but
it's so pretty and I absolutely love
this I've been really into drinking
green tea and herbal tea recently I
haven't had a cup of English breakfast
in so long but I've been having my green
tea in this in the mornings and I have
been loving it
plus you might have seen it cropping up
really randomly in the corner of my
Instagram pictures because I'm just so
obsessed and there's like blue and white
floral thing at the moment so yeah we
had obsession number two so I'm gonna do
this in a strange order I'm just going
to get everything out the way and then
do Beauty at the end the next two
favourites are actually brands there
have been two fashion brands this month
that I've been absolutely obsessed with
both of them previously I was like no
they're not for me but this month I have
just been blown away by these two brands
first one majorly I was just really not
that kind of aware of before I didn't
really think there was anything for me I
thought it was more teenage boys kind of
tourists but recently just been loving
everything and it's super dry so super
dry kindly invited me to their London
collections men event in their store on
Regent Street a few days ago and I was
invited to their premium shopping
area beforehand to pick up a few pieces
to wear at the event and everything in
there was just so so beautiful my
favorite piece is this embellished skirt
which what I mean I'd had no clue that
Superdry had anything like this it's all
really kind of very luxurious fabrics
everything has such amazing detail
there's some beautiful embroidered
dresses some like crochet sleeves but
this I mean this has taken hours and
hours of like delicate work it's got
beautiful stitching gorgeous
embellishment like beads and sequins and
it's just the most beautiful things so
this product itself is a favorite I
can't wait to let us on my some holidays
but also the brand as a whole if you
haven't checked out super Tyreese and
they have a look on their website
because you'll be so surprised at how
nice the stuff is the premium collection
the dresses blouses I've got white
blouses like a lace panel at the back
also beautiful so keep a look out on my
holiday videos and pictures because I'm
gonna be wearing a lot of super shy and
the second fashion brand which has
really taken me by surprise and made me
fall in love these past four or five
weeks is oasis so previously a wases
again I thought it not really for me
I didn't think didn't really have an
opinion of Oasis to be honest but I took
note of their window displays recently
the one I think it's our Bell Street
down by Oxford Circus just looked so
beautiful I think it was the V&amp;amp;A
collection that first caught my eye and
if you saw my Seville outfit Diaries
video then the first outfit I was
wearing in that with the blue top that
was from Oasis from the VNA collection
so I absolutely loved that and it was
that collection that kind of made me sit
up and pay attention but since then I've
been checking the website regularly and
I love so much stuff from that so this
top that I'm wearing now it's just this
from Oasis it's got these really cute
like crochet details on the bottom on
the sleeves it's just pretty you pink
stripes and this is more of a basic
piece and also these trousers I got from
mo says they're high-waisted kind of
stretchy cotton trousers and
China's clip for me wearing them because
you just can't get the full idea from me
holding them but they're really
beautiful almost Larry so easy to wear
this with a white top I get so many
compliments when I wear them and I
absolutely love these and generally just
their whole Vienna collection / their
pistols that they're gonna cut in at the
moment they've got like a tribal range
so definitely check out versus if you
haven't recently because they've got
some really really nice things and last
non-beauty piece and other fashion piece
it's this Topshop skirt I picked it up
recently I think there's only about 28
pounds it's stretchy so doesn't have a
zip or anything I was really surprised
how cheap it was and it just looks
really really cute it's got this like
scalloped hem at the bottom which I'm
really loving this kind of scalloped
detail at the moment I have I can see
already got like a bit of fake tan on
the inside there so they definitely need
to wash this one but it's really really
lovely and I think I'll be wearing this
a lot this size I love this and then
finally beauty and I only have four
products and they all of the same kind
of color tone so I just have this
brownie gold pile very small pile next
to me at the moment and the first thing
that I'm going to talk about is these an
semmen in radiance ice cubes so I have
been doing something with answering this
month that I've not done before and I'm
only using an Sun and Sun and the
feminine skincare so I've been using
their cleanser and moisturizer night
cream serums and also at these so these
are basically liquid skincare serum in a
pot which he fries and then in the
morning so you put the pot or the ice
cube in a little pouch and rub it all
over your face and of course it's
absolutely freezing but it really wakes
up the skin and it gives me just as
beautiful glow and I feel like it kind
of tightens the pores and just gets my
face ready for makeup one of my main
skincare concerns is under eye bags and
almost I guess the same or steroid
version of putting an upside down frozen
teaspoon on your eye and it has that
effect it just really shocks and wakes
up the area so makes you look more awake
instantly and they're just really really
lovely to use and so unusual I've never
heard of a skincare ice cube before but
absolutely you have been
loving using these and since doing V and
Summerlin skincare takeover only using
their products I found that my skin is
just behaving a lot lot better this
month so I've been really pushing away
all my foundations and going back to BB
creams and tinted moisturizer so I'm
back using the bare minerals complexion
rescue which I know I think I may have
featured in every favorites job ever
done so far but absolutely love this
still love it as much as the first time
I tried it I think the color now is more
suitable to my skin I've been picked
hanging a bit more and a little bit
brown from Seville so it's now an
absolutely perfect for manage and it's
just beautiful it gives a really lovely
glowy nourished feeling to your skin and
it's not as heavy as a foundation it's
got SPF 30 so I'll be wearing this one
on holiday as well so yep once again
bare minerals complexion rescue is a
favorite so the other makeup product
which I've been loving this month is the
benefit they're real mascara in brown
I've actually only been using this for
about a week but it's definitely a
favorite I already loved the black
version and they have now brought out
this mascara in brown and blue as well I
was really lucky to be invited to the
launch event for this and the blue
mascara and the push-up their real
liners which they brought out in blue
green purple and brown all surprisingly
really really wearable when I was
offered purple liner like oh I've got so
much to do after this event I don't have
it really scary but it was so beautiful
got so many compliments if you've got
hazily eyes like me then I definitely
recommend the purple but it's an
everyday product I've been using the
berry on mascara and Brown I find a
brown just looks a lot more natural and
it's much easier to wear than black that
can be really intense I mean there's
nothing wrong with that but I've has
been really loving switching it down to
a brown recently been building up Brown
very kind of everyday soft smokey eye
and finishing it at this and as with the
roller lash mascara and obviously if
you've used the benefit and they're real
and black then you'll know that it's got
this really lovely stiff bristled wand
which is great for really separating out
the lashes so I've been loving using
this recently and the event itself you
might have seen it on some bloggers
vlogs but it was so much fun we
basically got head-to-toe in these white
almost like asbestos detective suits and
goggles and phone cases and had a
massive paint fight there was
rifles there was water guns just
everything it was just a load of
bloggers and youtubers throwing ping to
each other it was so much fun and I
think you've had me benefit and was such
a great way to launch the new collection
and the final product in my June
favorites is this so it's the looks you
know I can't pronounce this ill produce
use or multi-purpose try oil for face
hand body and it's that golden version
so I first tried this when I took the
day at the Rosewood hotel with Braun
they gave us a leg makeover and this
spritz this on our legs to give a kind
of shimmery airbrush finish and then
also an looks event at the Sanderson
last week because they have launched
their products in the spa of the Sun Sun
hotel and I picked up one of these at
the event and I've been using it every
time I have been getting my legs out
ever since it's a spray bottle so really
easy to use you don't have to risk like
pouring it all over your lovely carpet
or anything and it just gives a
beautiful very subtle but glittery
shimmer to your legs
it's just really lovely if you're just
getting a hint of a tan or if you're on
holiday and you want to have a lovely
bit of shimmer and it smells really nice
it feels really soft and conditioning
I've not tried it on my face or hair yet
but maybe I will on a holiday I've been
loving using this recently and that is
it I feel like that was a really really
short favorite but equally I feel like
I've rambled on quite a lot so I hope
you've enjoyed looking through my
favourites with me let me know what your
favorites have been this month I feel
like I maybe need to be trying out a few
new makeup products so let me know if
