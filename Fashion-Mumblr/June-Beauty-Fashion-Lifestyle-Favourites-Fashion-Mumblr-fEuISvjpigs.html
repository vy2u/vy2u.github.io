video so last month's favorites video
was rather unglamorous let's just say
there are a few not so glamorous
products in there but luckily you'll be
pleased to know that this month's
favorites video I think will make up for
it because having a look at my little
pile of favourite pieces next to me
there's lots of really really lovely
products all of which I have absolutely
loved this month I think I've fallen in
love with these things this month more
than I've fallen in love with things in
previous months if that makes sense
um so yeah this month it's been really
really busy I'm sure you guys have seen
across all my channels I've been doing
loads of traveling I can't even I can't
even remember all the places that I've
been to this month which is absolutely
crazy
obviously America oh my god check
America I haven't actually included
anything in my favorites from check
America that's ridiculous check America
itself for the experience it's an
absolutely huge favorite this month
there's like so long ago oh my gosh but
yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed my truck
America vlogs I'll leave them all down
there so that's my first favorite check
America gosh how did I forget that that
was this month oh my god this favorites
would have been quite different if I'd
remembered that but anyway and then yes
they just got back from Milan um was in
Croatia the week before that so it's
been quite a busy month to say the least
so I could ramble for quite a long time
this morning I feel like I'm in quite a
rambling mood so before I go crazy on
the older rambling front I'm gonna get
started okay so my first favorite of
June is this pair of sunglasses I'm
afraid I cannot remember the brand name
because it's I think it might be like a
Jane Morgan or something like that or I
may have made that up
something along those lines but these
sunglasses were around to like 12 or 13
pound mark sort of really budget purse
friendly pair of sunglasses and I picked
these up
specifically before Croatia because when
I go on holiday I like to take a cheaper
pair of sunglasses with me for when I'm
in the water
when I'm doing things like
paddleboarding so I picked these up for
them to be like my cheaper pair but I
ended up wearing them so so so much I
just love the design of them I love the
light toward toys shell I love this bar
across the middle and I love that they
don't have the tabs here which means
when I put them on my head
they don't get caught in my hair which
is what happens at a lot of my nicer
sunglasses but I think value for money
and design these were such a great
product this month and even though I'm
back from holiday and I'm not
paddleboarding I'm still wearing these
as like my everyday sunglasses so these
are my first product favorite of the
month next products favorite is one
which I literally swore by while I was
out in Croatia it's not this actual one
because I finished the one that I use in
Croatia we left the empty bottle bare
but it's the piss plain tan and protect
tan accelerating oil so I already had a
bit of a base tan when I went to Croatia
and I just wanted to go more bronze
color and so if you use an oil it
obviously intense surprise the way that
the Sun reacts to your skin but by using
an SPF an SPF oil rather than you know
these ones that just literally baked
your skin it's so so so much safer and I
find that is when Tanner protects factor
15 is the one that really really makes
me go that gorgeous brown color this is
the factor 30 I haven't actually used
this one yet but this will be coming
with me to Greece next week because the
Sun that is just so intense and I have
burnt myself in the past in Greece and I
haven't used the right sun protection so
I'm gonna be taking the factor 30 with
me to Greece but I actually got a lot of
questions on my snapchat about what Sun
crema is using because obviously I was
showing it was like 35 degrees out there
so it was this and I highly highly
recommend it I'm gonna do my makeup
favorites next because otherwise they
might get lost in the clutter of my
coffee table so first up is the L'Oreal
nude magic cushion foundation and this
one I was very late to the party too if
I featured it quite a few times since
trying it because I have been so
so impressed with this it's obviously a
budget Foundation and so it I think it's
around the ten pound mark I will leave
the information down the exit can't
remove how much it is but I love the
packaging this beautiful lilac metallic
little case it comes in inside you've
got the big mirror you've got the little
cushion and then the cushion foundation
underneath so because of this compact
I've been keeping one in my handbag at
all times it's nice and slim so it stays
in my handbag and the mirror makes it
great for applying on the go but what I
love about it is the effect that it has
on my skin so even if I haven't prepared
my skin properly like with moisturizer
primer and all that jazz it still just
goes on so beautifully coverage wise
it's not too heavy it's a very light
fresh and glowy finish but at the same
time it's very buildable so using the
pad that comes in it I just Pat it more
onto the areas where I want more
coverage so for example I've had a few
blemishes around my chin this month so
I've just gone in and tapped it in maybe
three or four layers it sounds like a
lot but honestly it doesn't look like a
lot when you're wearing it so this has
been what I've been reaching for in the
evenings while I was on holiday and now
that I'm back in the UK I have a bit of
a tan I don't want to cake on lots of
makeup this is what I have been using
and loving this month also a holiday
favorite and I definitely mentioned this
probably in last year's favourites
probably last year's total year round up
but it's the currents I think it's
called the Trulie waterproof or ultra
waterproof but basically it's the
current waterproof mascara and I'm sure
any beauty blogger that's try this will
agree it is the most waterproof mascara
in the whole world so I have been
jumping off boats bombing diving getting
water splashed in my face rubbing my
eyes you name it and this mascara does
not budge and yet somehow it's really
easy to remove I don't know how they do
it but Clarins just you just can't beat
this mascara honestly I've talked about
it so much and this summer this
particular trip Croatia in particular
really reminded me how fabulous this is
and unlike a lot of waterproof mascaras
it still gives your lashes the impact
that you want from a mascara so it
separates it volumizes it's really
intense black it doesn't flake off on
your face when you get hot or maybe oily
if you've got some cream on your face I
don't recommend putting oil something on
your face by the way trying to find a
cream one but yeah this is fabulous and
I highly recommend it and one more beach
beauty products which I am obsessed with
at the moment is these new Bobby Brown
they're kind of an lipstick oil bomb I'm
not sure the official name nourishing
lip color and I've got the shade here at
ballerina pink and I was wearing this
all the time in Croatia and all the time
in Milan because it is so so comfortable
to wear in the summer I mean obviously I
love my matte lips but they are a little
drying a little bit more uncomfortable
but I've gone up got on at the moment is
Mac and I can really feel it on my lips
whereas if I wear this it has the
feeling of a bomb that still gives you
that beautiful wash of color in fact it
puts them through the top of my lipstick
that is another thing I love about it is
that you can just stick it over the top
of your lipstick to give it a little bit
more of a sheen but without being gauzy
and it just makes any lipstick more
comfortable to wear so I've got this
color and another one both very easy to
wear nudie Pink's another product you
can just fling in your handbag and it's
just so lovely to wear it's a gorgeous
color so flattering
the formula is beautiful not that
long-lasting but it's so nice to apply I
don't mind reapplying it every hour or
so so Reid beautiful one from Bobby
Brown and also I love the packaging it's
just so petite and there's something
just really satisfying about it I think
it looks so luxurious so yeah I think
this is the first Bobby Brown lip
product that I've really fallen in love
with but it's a good one to just start
with this next favorite kind of combines
two things so firstly it was my favorite
blogger male of the month and most so
many of you screenshotted my face my
expression when I opened this because I
actually opened it in my blog am an
unboxing video because I was just so
ever once receive it but this is the Tom
Ford orchid still a fragrance so yes it
was my favorite thing
this month but also it has been my
favorite to fragrance this month there's
something forgive my awfulness and
describing perfumes but there is
something it's so luxurious about this
not only is it I mean it's obviously a
lighter more summery version of the
classic orchid fragrance which you guys
know I'm obsessed with but the fact that
it is so much lighter and more summery
just makes it so so so wearable for both
day and evening I actually depends a
little bit of this to take in my hand
luggage to Milan recently since didn't
want to go a day without it but
fragrance aside the fragrance is amazing
but the bottle it's just it's the
highlight of my dressing-table is so
stunning rose gold beautiful fluted
glass and then you've got the Tom Ford
called plaque I just love it so it's so
so much the next two are also
beautifully scented products and second
to no third to last product is the
German own peony and Moss candle so this
morning and the Dave I'm filming this I
actually published a blog post all about
this because I love it so much um and
firstly it's just absolutely stunning
this glass container with the peonies on
it it just looks so beautiful I keep it
on that table and behind me next to an
actual bunch of peonies and it just
makes such a statement whenever people
come into the lounge I like oh that's
such a pretty candle everyone goes over
to it and has a little smell and this
smell is something else you need to go
to Roma nose drawing smell this because
it's so like it's so luxurious but so
fresh at the same time and it makes the
room smell so incredible like it really
makes the room it makes the whole room
feel more luxurious because the smell is
so nice it's really it's very earthy and
I think that's some note called cassis
that makes it earthy and also the moss
in there but the peony makes it really
pretty and feminine light and just so
easy one stop smelling it is so good
definitely try and get started early in
the store to smell this but the best
thing about this candle is that Joan
Malone releases as this year's charity
candle
so 75% of the profits from this candle
go towards their charity which is in
collaboration I believe there's some
Mungo's and what they do is they create
these gardens all around the country
there's one in back see when an
Edinburgh Manchester I believe Liverpool
and these gardens are just like an oasis
you can go to to rehabilitate yourself
get back in touch with the community and
just relax but they're all in
collaboration with charities so for
example if someone goes there's
obviously help for homeless people
so this candle if you needed another
reason to buy it it's that because it's
just such a lovely cause and such a
beautiful product then we have another
really luxurious products which for the
past couple of weeks I have been really
enjoying slathering this all over my
body and it's the Estee Lauder bronze
goddess whipped body cream so when we
encourage her one of the girls on my
boat was wearing France goddess and it
made me really my love for the fragrance
if you guys haven't smelled France
goddess then you definitely need to go
and smell it you have a lot of things on
your to smell to-do list after this
video and but bronze goddess is one of
those instantly recognizable incredible
smells and as you probably guess this is
a body lotion that smells a bit and it's
just it's not just the smell that makes
me love it but that is a huge help
whenever I put it on you can like smell
it on your skin for hours afterwards so
if you are um getting romantic maybe and
do you want to someone saw some hell on
your skin then this is a lovely one for
that but also the way that it feels on
the skin it's really rich but it doesn't
sit around on the skin for too long like
some really rich body lotions can do and
I feel like it just gives my skin I put
it on maybe four hours ago this morning
it gives my skin a really nice Sheen and
the sheen just seems to last for hours
and hours and I absolutely love that I
love the way it feels the way it smells
this is gorgeous this next one is fairly
random but when I featured on my
Instagram a lot of you guys asked about
it so I thought I would include it but
also it has been a favorite product this
month and it's this necklace which has
this beautiful leaf design on it and
it's wearable technology so it's called
a Bella Pete or the Brandis Bella beat
and this is their leaf design and it
didn't actually come with this chain I
put this chain on it so it came with a
leather strap you can wear it as a clip
so this back section can clip onto
browsers you can wear it with the
leather strap that it comes with other
bracelet or you can either use the strap
that it comes with or use another
necklace chain it to wear as a necklace
which is what I do and you download the
app for Bella beat on your phone and it
monitors your steps it monitors your
sleep it monitors your periods if you're
a girl I don't think a guy would wear
this but it does that do so that's all
kind of like standard stuff but what I
really really love about this in the app
in particular is that it has a
meditation and breathing techniques so
if you wear this around on the hip band
of your trousers or like leggings while
you're doing these meditation exercises
it monitors your breathing and the
meditation and guided breathing exercise
on the app are so good I've really got
into a habit of just spending 10 minutes
in the morning doing the breathing
exercises doing the meditation I just
press play on my phone and it's just a
really really nice way to start date so
what I love about this is that it
encompasses of course the fitness side
of it and it helps you monitor your
daily activity but also that more kind
of mindful meditation side of it and
it's really pretty as well they keep
getting loads of compliments when I'm
wearing it oh my taxis here so I need to
round this up pretty quickly and but
yeah a really beautiful design and
really good functionality within it as
well so yeah I've been really enjoying
wearing and using this this month and my
last favorite and if you follow me on
snapchat then you will not be surprised
to see this is the book the secret so I
could go on about this book for so long
in fact I may do a more kind of in-depth
video about this but not actually the
book but what it did is my favorite
thing this one
so basically this book is all about gosh
this is not going to come out very well
in words I'm really bad at describing
things like this but this book tells you
about how positive thinking and really
believing in certain things can make
them happen because of frequencies in
the universe better with me so basically
it's saying that as people our brain
power and the things that we think about
is such a high frequency that the
universe will connect that frequency and
make these things happen I'm so sorry
this sounds like such a mumbo-jumbo but
honestly so I decided to test this
theory out and it says things like
you've got to be grateful for for what
you have and you have to just don't
think negative things that other people
don't be jealous don't be spiteful just
think positively and positive things
will come back to you and I've always
believed in that but this book goes one
step further and it says that if you
really want something then ask ask the
universe for it and really believe that
it's going to happen so it tells you all
about how to how to think in a way that
will make these things happen and what
the book suggests is that you try this
theory out on something really small so
while we're in Croatia I thought okay
I'm going to use this theory and I would
like to see dolphins and it's not an
impossible thing to happen like that or
dolphins out there but it's still a
fairly rare thing to happen but on the
third day on the boat I use all the
techniques of this book recommended and
I thought I use the techniques to summon
dolphins I'm just thinking really
possibly that it was going to happen I
said to China's like don't think
anything negative about this statement
that dolphins were going to see some
dolphins in a couple of days and then
the next day like five minutes after I
told Charlie that we saw them so I just
went absolutely mental and we didn't
just see one we saw a whole huge pod of
dolphins they were jumping right by the
boats it's really special and yeah it
could be a coincidence but I honestly
think that using the techniques in this
book made those dolphins appear I sound
like such crazy person right now but
honestly I highly recommend reading this
book it's really really interesting even
if it's just for like a whole positivity
and thinking more positive
and hopefully it does work this
technique about thinking about things
and then they will happen gosh I'm
really not doing myself any favors or
sound like a crazy person I'm gonna shut
up now but I will talk about this better
in future videos because it really is
special and I've not done it any favors
but I've just described it just sound
like a madwoman so I'm gonna finish this
video here because I've got a taxi
waiting outside and I really need to go
I'm so sorry but that is everything I
have got through everything I wanted to
share with you guys this month and so
