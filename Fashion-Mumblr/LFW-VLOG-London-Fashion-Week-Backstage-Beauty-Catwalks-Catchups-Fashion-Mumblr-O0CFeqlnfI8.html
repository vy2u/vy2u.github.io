London Fashion Week vlogs I have got
into a habit of creating really long
vlogs recently so I might break this up
into every day that I do I'm coming to
Fashion Week on Friday Saturday and
Sunday so I might do a daily vlog or I
might do all three in one but you will
know by the title of this already as I
kept seeing into the future right now
crazy you will already know what I'm
doing but I'm gonna stop rambling
because I'm in a bit of a rush this
morning I took it into my infinite
wisdom to film a get ready with me yes
I'm the first morning of Fashion Week
and get ready with me get ready with me
videos take forever to film so my
bedroom is a bit of a bomb site luckily
the brightness on this camera is kind of
blowing all out but it's the bomb site
in here and and little Dexter is
shredding the rug I can't control that
man can't control any man can we really
but I know about to leave the house I
will do a little quick outfit of the day
for you I have probably worn this outfit
before in a vlog but I've kind of been
testing it before to make sure it's good
for Fashion Week and I like it so I will
show you now what I'm wearing all righty
so it is this gray / brown / golden very
high roll neck top from Topshop which
has got a really nice asymmetric detail
over here and then my lovely wide leg
white trousers also from Topshop and my
little next Sun doors which were really
comfortable so definitely be good for
wearing all day long and then I've just
added also my Topshop sunglasses to my
hair may need to keep my hair in place
but also just in case it does get nice
and sunny
I've just finished packing my Chloe Fae
dupe handbag I've got some essentials on
my phone my house keys portable charger
then I'm also taking a tote bag with me
with spur maker another spare charger
invitations and camera equipment so
little Dexter stop chewing naughty boy
this is just some of the mess after my
get ready with me video I'm gonna head
out
the first show that I've got is Bora
Axew and I'm going backstage with kms
the hair company so we'll have a little
bit of behind the scenes hair action and
then I've got Felder Felder with
Schwarzkopf and then I'm gonna head to
the apartment I think see what's going
on there maybe catch up with some emails
because I've got relatively free often
the employee catch up the girls to do
some outfit photos and then getting a
spray tan with Rita liberato ready for
holiday and the rest of Fashion Week so
anyway let's get going
so just got backstage our core
activities in the VFC show expands at
how you apparently last year gotten here
with cameras and
I'm so busy
people drink
the apartment is nice and quiet Roman is
kind of even great location assailant
she's right by my state entrance and
breakfast
breakfast writable by a theme
so just had my hair refreshed by dweller
at the apartment you needed doing I
washed it last night so that they were
able to cut it for me looking nice gang
and now I am just walking through the
felt l - oh I'm gonna meet the girls and
do some backstage beauty and then the
actual show it's really funny with it
not being semester houses here is a
little bit a little bit dingy and the
VFC show smooth switches in a car
parking servo right now these things
happened and it's got a bit more than
New York feel to it which is quite nice
a little bit rough around the edges but
yeah so heading to filter filter now
which is the Freemasons who think I know
where I'm going
always going around around Soho area so
I'll see you at that
we made it backstage I felt another is
another Freemason school
hey guys I'm talked in a while and what
do you look for the apartments excuse me
the place
it's like my noodle I can shut our area
which is the one eyes can't see
here is a wardrobe room where we can
borrow some nice clothes but it's brands
on here we can borrow you see behind me
so well
so I've already bought a jacket from
River Island and began those notes of
the brands and stuff we can grow in the
area by me position actually lovely new
hand cream which is a really nice smell
you go in a workstation here
we just had our booties with veins
there's still a few little reminisce out
but originally tup and then this is just
like a communal area
hey guys sorry I did not to vlog the
rest of my afternoon to be honest I just
stayed at the apartment chilled out
quite a lot of the afternoon and then
went what a spray tan a beauty Liberata
hence my lack of makeup and horrible
parents Ryan Alice's sorry about that
but I'm home now I've got a little boy
back he's currently trying to find
something to chew on the floor and the
little boy and and I've got absolutely
tons of emails I need to sort out and
post to edit photos to edit videos to
edit including this one so I'm gonna say
