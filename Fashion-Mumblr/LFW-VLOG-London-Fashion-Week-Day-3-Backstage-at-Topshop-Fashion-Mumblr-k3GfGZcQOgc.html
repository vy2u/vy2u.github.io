Fashion Week and it's about 11 o'clock
so I've had quite a chilled morning
because I've been packing because going
to Italy tomorrow and we being me and
month so um I will show you my outfit of
the day before I head out wasn't really
sure what to wear today I kind of didn't
plan my Fashion Week outfits like I
thought I was going to didn't have the
time my hair is just day to her from the
curls that Peter from Weller created for
me yesterday still really liking it
t-shirt is this kind of grey mal
crackled not really sure how you
describe this kind of print but yeah
grey t-shirt from whistles and this
lovely floaty skirt is from Oasis it's
actually a little bit big and I put a
few or mums put a few tucks in the back
but you can't see those so we're all
good
this necklace is Topshop it's half
marble not real marble and then wipe it
on the end
Caravelle watch which I'm borrowing from
the apartment today and then my little
next sandals which I wear all the time
and then the bag I'm taking with me
today is this one here it's a backpack
which I was given very kindly from
Radley and yeah I think it's going to be
quite convenient being able to sling it
on the back so that's the outfit of the
day so I'm about to leave now mum's
going to drop me down at Brixton first
point of call will be the apartment
because I'm going to chop off the things
that I've borrowed hello
I'm trying to sneak into my blogs so
young and a ghost apartment and drop
some bits off and maybe have some
breakfast if I'm in time gosh that's
bright and then I'm going backstage to
the Topshop show with L'Oreal which I'm
so excited for always wanted to go to
the Top Shop show I'm not sure if I'm
going to actual show or just backstage
but we'll soon find out and then reward
style having an event to which I think
I'll drop in to later as well
my apartment now and I'm just being for
another little explore this place is
like a mayonnaise as so many rooms and
behind me this is a discreet or just in
case fashion week discuss too much you
can just go and have a little nap which
is amazing
I'm back home now after another long day
of Fashion Week I did have a few more
tickets to presentations and another
show this afternoon but I'm just so
knackered I've even got a bit cold like
the old Fashion Week Feliz I thought be
good to come home and just relax a
little bit to get some work done and
finish it off packing because of course
tomorrow mum and I off to Italy really
excited for that so I really hope you
guys have enjoyed coming around Fashion
Week with me it's been quite fun
blogging it and I feel like I'm getting
more into swing and flogging being a
little bit silly on camera and you know
feel that you guys getting to know each
other a little bit better now so thank
you for watching if you've watched all
of my Fashion Week vlogs not sure again
if it's gonna be one or two or even
three vlogs but thank you very much if
you've made it this far you've obviously
watched them all hopefully so the rest
of the afternoon today I just ended up
staying at the apartment had a nice KFC
lunch because I think the apartment at
KFC opponents like collaboration
together and then Ellie from the L next
door and I we went and took some nice
outfit photos we just found quite a nice
Street in Soho and yeah this is my snaps
then I came home and I'm now just gonna
take off my makeup put some really comfy
clothes on and take off my makeup did I
already say that my mind is just gone
and kiss my little boy finished packing

night so I hope you've enjoyed watching
