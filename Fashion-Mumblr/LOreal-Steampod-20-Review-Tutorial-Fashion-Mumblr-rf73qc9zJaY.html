lovely day so far I decided today to do
a review video for the L'Oreal steam pod
I did I did a review video a little
while back for the Phillips Lumiere for
the hair removal system and that went
down really well and notably guys
commented saying that's really useful
and it helped you with your purchase
decisions and the l'oreal steamed pod
which is this gadget right here this has
come out or has been really launched
quite recently and I'm sure that a few
of you will be thinking about putting on
your Christmas lists or maybe just
thinking about treating ourselves so
feeling more useful mean to do a little
video just giving you my thoughts on it
and a little tutorial on how it works as
well so this is the L'Oreal and Rowenta
salon steam pod as I said it's
relaunched and it's come out a beautiful
white color ready for Christmas time
ready for 2016 and to be honest having
tried this I will not be going back to
my normal hair strainers which is quite
a big statement when you think the
straighteners
I guess couple of brands on the market
which really dominate so to say that
I'll be using this over my existing hair
straighteners is quite a sweeping
statement so if you want to find out why
then keep on watching so let's start by
having a look at Eve gadget itself so
this here is the L'Oreal steam pod as
you can see it's a little bit bigger
than most hair straighteners especially
up here it's a lot wider I would say
it's not that much heavier though so if
you're worried about it being really
heavy it's it's really not that heavy
it's quite light in fact and inside the
straightener there are two ceramic
plates here and here and then
like home which you can see along here
so this is really good or combing
through the hair if you like to use a
hammer please straighten your hair
normally the cutting kind of does up for
you and it makes sure your hair is nice
and spread out as it glides through the
ceramic plates so normal hair
straighteners they are obviously made
from ceramic plates which heat up to
really high temperatures but those high
temperatures can leave your hair quite
damaged and dry whereas the L'Oreal
steam pod has got ceramic plates here
and here and but it's also got a comb
and within the chrome guy little jets
here which is where the steam comes out
and essentially the steam just make sure
that your hair stays nice and
moisturized which protects from so much
heat damage so if you've got colored
hair like me or if you've got quite fine
hair or if it hair is dry anyway in
print damage then this is definitely
going better for the condition of your
hair the product itself is quite a bit
bigger than normal hair straighteners or
at least like more modern hair
straighteners i remember the days when
th DS are this big but up here it's a
little bit fatter so it's quite wide at
the top and not quite as portable it's a
normal hair straighteners but that's
because it has got this steam
functionality inside it as well as the
actual plump part of it that's it you
call it there's also the steam pod here
and inside here this is where you put
the water you just pick that put this
under the tap fill this up to the
maximum line with water and then it has
these pressed edge underneath so you can
pop it on your windowsill and it won't
fling on the floor and get water
everywhere so it's really great you can
just press it onto your windowsill or
table or dressing table and you know the
UH not
still Indonesia everywhere so that's
great so you plug it in leave it to heat
up and there's a couple of buttons
inside here there's an on/off button and
a plus and minus button so the steam pod
has five different temperatures that he
gets from around 140 to 210 but I might
have been might I made those up I'll
leave you the information down below so
you can adjust the temperature I use it
on kind of like a middle temperature
because well my individual hairs are
quite fine I do have a lot of it and
take forever if I didn't use it on quite
a quite a good temperature so then once
you've let it heat up for a few minutes
it really doesn't take that much longer
than roasted hair straighteners and
you'll start to hear it making a kind of
whirring noise and that's when it's
ready to go
so how does it work well the first thing
that you do is you take the little steam
pod here into the bathroom and you open
up the flap fill it up with water up
until like a maximum line and then you
use the Holly Hill pressed hood to pop
onto any surface whether it's a window
sill like I have done and then you
switch it on at the block after a few
minutes these will have heated up and a
senior of five heat settings between 140
and 210 degrees so just to use the plus
and minus buttons inside to choose
whichever heat setting is best for your
home and then basically you just
straighten your hair like you would with
normal pair of strangers so I really
love the fact that the comb here
ops to brush through the hair so you
don't have to use a brush beforehand so
again here is a clip of my hair before
you can see it's just a little bit
frizzy and a bit wild and then
afterwards my hair is just much sleeker
you can see I haven't lost any of the
shine one of the things that blondes
often suffer from when they get their
hair straightened is a girl bit trying
dry and lose the shine whereas with
steam pod because the moisture has been
retained in my hair there's no loss of
shine after I've use the steam pod after
I finished straightening my hair I then
used one of the products which you can
buy alongside the steam pod and this is
their beautifying protecting concentrate
I just added a few drops of this you see
ends of my hair afterwards which just
helps to seal the ends if some just
gives you an overall more glossy finish
more perfected and yeah great for if
you're just going to leave your hair
straight so overall I'd say that the
pros of getting the Loreal steam pod
that it's a lot less damaging on your
hair and a normal hair straightener the
steam just helps to ensure that the
moisture is kept in your hair so as you
can see my hair right now
is nice and shiny and my hair is never
shiny so it's so much better now that
I've been using the Loreal steam pod I
also find my hair as much softer after
using it after I've use my normal
straight as my hair I'd feel a little
bit dry and I just want to put loads of
creams and lotions in ever with the
steam pod I just put a few drops of the
oil in just to seal the ends and my hair
I wish you guys can feel it so lovely
and soft and just feels really
lightweight as well sometimes with my
own straight nose I just used to feel
like my hair would hang straight and
flat and lifeless whereas at least with
the steam quad I still got a bit of life
bit of bounce in the hair even after
straightening I'd also say it's great
out light and attractive it is it's
lovely there's something white and gold
design I really like it I saw the old
ones were black and blue I think it
wasn't such a fun now that it's weingold
I think it's much more beautiful and
it's lightweight as well so you're going
to worry about giving to heaven or makin
all of that but then that does leave me
on to a few cons with the product
firstly its size I mean with this and
this it's not really to travel friendly
so I wouldn't be throwing out my oldest
trainers cuz I think if I'm going like a
weekend away or a night away then I'll
still pack my old straighteners just
because it is quite big and would take
up quite of room in my overnight bag and
this part here is particularly clunky
it's just a tiny bit more inconvenient
than normal string as to just because
you have to fit up the steam pod but I
really think that the benefits aren't
way that negative it just takes 20
seconds more of your morning routine
just to fill this up and then finally my
only other negative is that you can't
curl your hair with the L'Oreal steam
hood or at least I don't think you can
I've never seen anybody comb at home
maybe I'll give it a try and but yeah as
far as I can think they'd all be
believed negatives and as I said my hair
just feels so much sleeker lighter
sweeter and doesn't feel damaged and
doesn't look damaged it looks healthy
which for me is the main
and if you like to straight know how in
a daily basis then you should definitely
consider getting the Loreal steam quad
this is not sponsor me oh by the way I
just generally thought it'd be
interesting I know I'm really saying
yeah you need to come by this but I
genuinely think is such a super product
so I really hope you guys have found
this video useful I hope that if you
were thinking about getting the Loreal
steam pod and maybe had a few questions
hopefully I've answered a few of those
if you have got any more questions
anything that I haven't spoken about
then definitely leave a comment down
below and I will always try my hardest
to get back to you it's around 150 pound
mark so it's not cheap but then normal
straighteners aren't cheap anyway and if
you really want a good quality hair
product which isn't going to damage your
hair as much as normal strangers then I
just wouldn't go for anything else as I
said now that I've tried the steam pod I
won't be going back to my normal
straighteners on an everyday basis I
think this is a great one to add to your
Christmas wish list so if you think you
are getting a new hair gadget for
Christmas then I definitely recommend
popping this on your wish list so yeah I
really hope you guys have found this
video useful if you have them please

questions and if you're new to my
