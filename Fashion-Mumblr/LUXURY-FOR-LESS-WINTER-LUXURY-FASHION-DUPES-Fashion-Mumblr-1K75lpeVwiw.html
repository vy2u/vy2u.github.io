me for today's video it is going to be
my January dupes video I've had quite a
lot of requests since I think before
Christmas to do this video and I've been
saving up quite a few dupes that I found
on the high street to share with you now
I know I've done a few of these videos
before I will leave them linked down
below because a lot of those tubes are
still in stock all the websites are
still stocking similar dupes but today's
video is going to be slightly different
because I found so many dupes that
obviously I have not bought all of them
because I don't need all of them but I
did want to share with you those tips
that I found anyway so for the first
part of the video I'm going to be
sharing with you the dupes that I found
and that I bought and then towards the
end I'm going to share with you a few
more dupes I have found on the internet
I'm going to insert photos of them so
that you can see them but I just haven't
bought them all because that would be
crazy so I'm gonna get started
straightaway
firstly with a scarf so I feel like
everyone on my Instagram has been going
crazy over the acne scarf lately and I
have invested in scars before I have
invested in the burberry scarf but I
felt that there were so many high street
dupes for the acne scar that was so
indetectable II different that makes
sense
I don't know so similar that I just
couldn't justify the acne one and for me
the most similar is this Topshop one
it's a really lovely thick scarf it's a
beautiful soft material the color is
almost identical to the acne scar and it
was a tenth of the price so if you
really like that style if Instagram has
persuaded you that you need it but you
just can't afford it or you don't want
to spend that much then this Topshop one
is a really lovely alternative it has
the same kind of tassels at the bottom
really lovely and soft and a super
flattering color the next Joop and this
is kind of a website slash style as a
whole is a brand called chichi London
and I've had a couple of their dresses
before absolutely love them this I would
say is a really lovely dupe for self
portrait dresses now it's not an exact
copy of any particular designer but the
style is very similar to that self
portrait style I just really love this
lace detail I love the fact that it's
monochrome the black and the white works
so beautifully together and I also find
that high necklines mixed with a fairly
short skirt I mean this is kind of
midway between the e size and the knees
so not ridiculously short still really
love
the elegant feminine feminine length but
I find that the high neckline just makes
our style really really beautiful
similarly to the current season of
self-portrait it's also got long sleeves
at the cuff detail down at the bottom
and then it's also got this loop hole
detail at the back secured with a ribbon
fastening so a beautiful beautiful dress
whether or not you care that it's quite
similar in style to self-portrait or not
it's still an absolute beautiful dress
sticking with dresses this next one and
a few others on ASOS really surprised me
because I thought they were so similar
to needle and thread dresses in fact I
added a few to my basket I'm gonna
insert a photo here of me wearing one
for a shoot that I did at the Savoy just
before Christmas the whole time I was
wearing it I thought that I was wearing
a needle and thread dress that's how
similar it was but actually was a sauce
so it's under 100 pounds this one
equally I think is about 85 pounds I've
bought this as a potential to wear to an
engagement party or if we do an
engagement photo shoot it's got the same
level of detail that you'd expect from
needle and thread this beautiful
embroidery you've got 3d fabric flowers
on there dye Mantes sequins beading
absolutely beautiful and then along the
back it has got a button closure going
into a zip closure and then this really
beautiful lightweight material which is
just so floaty so feminine and very much
needle and thread vibes so if you're
looking for a more affordable
alternative to a needle and thread dress
for perhaps a prong for your bridesmaids
then definitely check out the ASOS
premium occasion wear because I am very
very impressed with these designs next
up is quite possibly my favorite duke
for this video and I have spent years
and years and years searching the high
street for a real dupe of a Burberry
trench now obviously I don't mean the
check pattern on the lining or things
like that because that would be verging
on copying but just something that
really gives the look of a Burberry
trench if you told someone you're
wearing Burberry they'd be like oh yeah
actually I can I can see that this one
is from River Island it's 85 pounds and
I absolutely love it and insert some
clips here of me wearing it because
seeing it on the hanger just does not do
it justice it's the most beautiful fit
around the body it's tailored gorgeously
the detail and the buttons the buckle is
just so so premium looking the way that
it fits is absolutely gorgeous and it is
the kind of fit you would expect to find
on a more luxurious coat such as a
Burberry so Weldon River Island I'm so
so impressed with this coat and I know a
lot of you guys are loving it as well
I've seen lots of you clicking on my
links with this and buying this coat so
I'm so pleased that you love it as much
as I do
this next tip I'm kind of pre-empting
because every spring we see premium high
street retailers like All Saints Reese
whistles they often bring out their very
own suede pink jacket because it's just
such a versatile items have in your
wardrobe River Island have beat them to
it this year and they've already bought
out there do you pair do for something
that hasn't even come on the high street
yet this season but I had the Reese way
jacket last year and I absolutely love
it can't wait to wear it again but this
one from Rome Islands I picked up as
well it has this beautiful waterfall
detail on the neckline the quality of
this faux suede is absolutely beautiful
it's so soft a really really gorgeous
piece I love the light gold detailing on
the metal bits you've got the studs the
zips all a really beautiful light gold
and this was only 60 pounds so a really
really good price as well and then a
third do you again from River Island
this is a classic camel coat this is
basically a dupe for so many things so
many retailers designer
premium high street bring out camel coat
especially this time of year they're
fantastic for transitioning from really
cold winter days into slightly warmer
spring days because they are just so so
versatile the color is great for that
transitional period this one was 85
pounds so a really fabulous high-street
alternative the designing ones of this
you'll find on places like Max Mara
again Burberry Reese in fact I have
something very similar to this from
Reese and once again of all of the camel
coats on the high street this is the
most premium looking one that I have
found so once again well done Reb island
moving on to accessories and in a few of
these instances I also earn the designer
items I'm going to show you them both to
compare starting off with the Chloe Nile
bracelet bag can you guess which one is
real if you know what color I have then
you'll already know this is my real one
this is from Chloe and and I just
absolutely adore it's beyond belief this
is a fraction of the price it's from a
website called artisan anything and they
have some really really beautiful dupes
I believe they also have the discount
codes I can share with you guys
so
if that is still live then I'll leave it
on the screen and also down below that
we links to everything mention this
video down below so just click show more
but the quality of this piece is
absolutely beautiful it is on par I
would say with the Chloe bag which is
incredible so many high street dupes
don't have that attention to detail but
this is a beautifully crafted handbag so
many other design details are absolutely
identical to the Chloe bag from where
the studs are located from the type of
metal that they've used for the fixtures
the closure is the same inside is the
same the fact that it has the over
shoulder strap and once again whether or
not you care that it's a dupe off the
Chloe bag it's just a really really
gorgeous handbag I find they're so
practical the fact that you can just pop
them on the wrist they instantly make an
outfit look so much more luxurious and I
would definitely recommend checking out
the other bags on this website too they
have a gorgeous Jeep of the Chloe pixie
bag so many dupes and yeah beautiful
beautiful quality another of my favorite
dupes for this video is this pair of
boots and these are from ego I've always
found the ego footwear I have fabulous
dupes from Stuart Weitzman's Valentino
etc etc but I actually do own the steel
Weitzman boots which are very similar to
these I got them in the January sales
but when I saw these I was like I've
just got to give them a go I think at
the moment they are 26 99 on the website
they do go up to 44 99 but at the moment
they're in the sale I have to say there
are a few quality issues with these
stitching is not very tidy the edges for
example on this sip don't if you can see
it there but it's just not particularly
neat and tidy so from close-up they're
not the best quality but from a distance
how they make your outfit look they
really are a fabulous fabulous dupe of
the Stuart Weitzman boots so if you want
to just get the look you don't
necessarily care about having tip-top
quality you just want that look of
Stuart Weitzman then these are the best
ones I have found on the high street
they don't fall down the legs they're
soft on the legs they're comfortable to
wear and a really really good price
sticking with Footwear but back to River
Island these mules I absolutely fell in
love with them I do have a pair of grey
meals from briefs that I wear so much so
I knew that mules are a really versatile
type of footwear to have in my wardrobe
so instantly snapped these up I always
sing the river island Footwear it's very
very good quality for the price
especially these I've taken the price
tag off but once again
be linked down below they are almost
identical to a pair that I was very very
tempted by in fact that I saw a net
reporter from a brand called Paul
Andrews which were over the 500 pound
mark these obviously are a fraction of
that price and I think that mules as we
go into spring and summer will be seeing
a lot more of them so definitely pick
these up now before they go out of stock
if they haven't already fingers crossed
because they are just such a versatile
piece and they work with so many
different outfits in at your wardrobe
the last thing I'm going to show you
from River Island and these are a pair
of boots which are very very similar to
my Stuart Weitzman all Jill boots so
probably my most worn Footwear in my
entire wardrobe are my black suit white
cement boots with the elasticated
section at the back and just like those
and these have also got that slightly
dipped hem at the top here don't if you
call it a hem one it's boots same chunky
heel which makes them very very
versatile and easy to wear for a long
day of wearing and then this little zip
closure here as well so they're super
easy to get on and off so once again if
you do want that Stuart Weitzman look
and you do want a really good quality
pair of boots and these are a lovely
option to go for as always Shion have so
many dupes they are a website I think
based in Los Angeles I get loads of
questions about the shipping I've never
had any problems with the customs for
Sheehan the quality is not always on
points but that's what I'm here for to
let you know about the pros and the cons
one thing that I am very impressed with
are these boots they are dupes for
Valentino boots and I have worn these so
so much very very versatile very subtle
detail which gives them nods Valentino
these studs up here nice thickness of
heel which makes them very comfortable
and I don't have any issues with the
quality of these boots this bag is one
where we're really kind of figuring out
where the boundary is between dupe and
downright counterfeit copy it is of
course very very similar to the Louis
Vuitton CAD poutine I think that's what
it's called bag which I've had on my
wish list for so so long so as I like to
do when something is on my wish list I
got the dupe first I'll see how much I
reach for it to how much I wear it how
many my outfits it goes with and if I
find that I'm wearing it a lot then
maybe it's time to invest in the real
deal this one is I mean it's not the
best quality it's not a badly made bag
but it's obviously nothing on the Louis
VIII bag it's got this flap which keeps
all of your items inside covered mine
still has the stuffing in it as
section in the middle and then a little
pocket inside - I think this is quite
considerably smaller than the Louis
Vuitton bag but still quite a good size
for an everyday handbag she and also
have their very own copy of the Cloe
pixie bag this one is quite a lot
smaller than the actual Cloe bag they
may have it in two different sizes I'm
not too sure but yeah this is the one
that I decided to go for in a green I
also I don't know if you remember but I
also bought a dupe for the Cloe pixie
bag from River Island a little while ago
and I've still got them in my wardrobe
haven't worn it quite so much lately I'm
not sure that it's still on the website
but if it is I'll leave that link down
below this one is even more similar to
the CRO a pixie bag it's got the same
kind of handle the same detailing on the
front and then you have got that zip
fastening to make it nice and secure
this is a dupe of the Prada bag I
probably am NOT going to wear this one
it says Jing pin pshew on the front
they're quite random but it is a very
nice style bag once again the Prada bag
is on my wish list but it's just so
expensive I can't see myself investing
in that anytime soon so you have to lift
the lever bit faux leather out of there
to open it up and then inside you've got
the strap and then just this one
envelope pocket inside makes for a nice
evening bag if you do want to get the
look for less then this is a really
lovely option for the Prada bag and
lastly from Chien this is a Jeep of the
Gucci bags I actually think this is
really really cute and I'll be taking
this on some summer holidays with me
it's got this faux bamboo strap you've
got the embellishments like the bug
embellishments on the front here two
little dragonflies and then the
embroidery of the roses just like the
Gucci it's got the magnetic clasp and
then inside you've got two main sections
and a little shoulder strap and then
once again the envelope pockets at the
back the Gucci bags like this are so
expensive and I wouldn't spend that
amount of money on a bag this size
that's this statement I know up see I've
got my Valentino gloom look etc but this
is one that I was like no I'm just gonna
stick with the Jib because I just don't
know how long this kind of statement bag
will be in fashion and now this is the
last item that I have to physically show
you this is a bag that I recently got
from Dorothy Perkins and it is almost
identical to my sanely round bucket bag
last spring I will most
on bag as my everyday handbag I love to
have a big bucket bag to show off all of
my stuff in and this is pretty much
identical slightly darker pink my Saint
Laurent also has a wire cell logo on
these hanging bit for other than that
the same the wrong one doesn't have any
detail inside nor does this one but
considering the price of this bag I
think it's just a really lovely addition
to a pre spring wardrobe so as I
mentioned the rest of these items I
haven't actually bought but I have
discovered them during my research for
you guys so I hope you don't mind we're
going to read from my notebook and then
also put pictures on the screen of the
dupes that Antonia about okay so firstly
accessorize I do actually have my real
version of what they have a jeep for and
they have a do before my Gucci Milan
chevron bag
so the accessorize one is of course a
fraction of the price of this one but
you can get the exact same look - the
Gucci logo for a whole lot less
and then also in accessorize I know I
didn't mention it in my last chips video
but the Z or Zed for accessorized
collection has some beautiful dupes for
Monica vintage jewelry also for some of
my favorite estrogen mu pieces I will
leave a few of my favorites from that
range up on the screen now and these
ones will be linked down below if you
wanted to shop them but that whole range
as a whole I definitely recommend be
lining for it if you go past and
accessorize store and on the website
they have a huge range as well ok so a
boot style that I think is not going out
of fashion anytime soon is the sock boot
and I know a lot of instagramers and
bloggers invested in the Valencia argyll
ones last year and they're actually very
disappointed with the quality I've heard
they fray they're not comfortable
they've not been made very well well
luckily for us that didn't invest in the
Balenciaga ones the high street has some
really lovely options this year I
actually wore a pair of Karen Millen
dupes for these shoes during a recent
shoot with them I'll leave a photo of
them up on the screen here and I fell in
love with them I am actually going to
treat myself to a pair because they were
so comfortable and I can imagine them
being super super versatile because they
are very slim fitting they work really
well with jeans with skirts with black
tights gorgeous gorgeous pair of boots
that I know I'll get a lot of wear out
of and a fraction of the price of the
Balenciaga of course Karen Millen is a
premium high street retailer but I also
found the pair I think they were $27.99
from new look which are very very
I loop those linked up on the screen now
so you can see what the new-look ones
look like they're a great way to get the
look for a whole lot less now I'm not
sure that Topshop have ever done
really oops before but when I went into
the store recently I saw a lot of bags
which were most certainly inspired by
designer bags for example they had some
bum bags which were in that quilted
almost chevron design very very similar
to the Gucci bum bag I thought they
looked really lovely a beautiful color
selection as well and then they had some
round bags as studs on them and the
rounded metal handles which were most
definitely very reminiscent of the Chloe
Pixy bags they also had quite a lot of
styles with fringing around the lock and
that is the detail that we're seeing a
lot of designers doing this season they
definitely keep a lookout on the Topshop
website for more hand baggage oops okay
and this is where I really do need to
read from my notebook because miss Papp
is a retailer that is almost becoming
renowned for dupes they have so so many
tubes on their website at the moment
they have a bag that is almost identical
to the gucci dialysis I've seen it in
grey I've seen it in pale blue in pink
it's literally almost identical it's
unbelievable they have a jib of the
Chanel boy bag once again in a variety
of different colors the Valentino clutch
bag they have got that with the stands
they've got it without studs they've got
different color options they have loads
of dupes for my Valentino glam lock bag
once again in loads and loads of
different colorways this is probably one
of my most worn designer bags and they
have got a load of dupes for that as
well the Chloe Niall bag they've got
that in gold and some more neutral
colors to the Chloe back pagli even have
dupes for I've written down that they've
got dupes for the Chloe mules with the
faux fur on them with pearl detail as
well Stuart Weitzman shoes we're still
seeing those pink pearly sandals
everywhere being ripped off left right
and centre Paul Stuart Weitzman but I
just absolutely loved those shoes and
both miss pop and misguided half shoes
with that style of deep with that style
detail on them as well and then Miss Pat
also have dupes
of loads of different kinds of Valentino
boots ones similar to the sheen ones
that I showed you earlier
they've got ones with the rock studs
doing like a crisscross detail so if you
do want a Valentino esque boot with the
studded detail then again miss tab is
your go-to
so those are the dupes that I have found
on the high street this January I have
chose
my favorites to add to my own wardrobe
and I hope you found my kind of shopping
list of other dupes that I found useful
even though I didn't have them to show
you in real life let me know in the
