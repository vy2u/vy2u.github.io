very soon I have so much fun content
planned for you in the coming weeks and
months so be great to have you back
today we're going to be doing a luxury
unboxing so I'm going to be opening up
some new purchases and these are very
much luxury pieces I didn't want to say
haul because I don't think you can
really haul at luxury purchases haul to
me always feels a little bit impulsive
and a little bit frivolous whereas these
were very much carefully considered
pieces I have chosen because I feel that
they're going to elevate my entire
spring wardrobe and they're three pieces
and I'm going to be unboxing in today's
video all of which do have a designer
price tag so they were not a frivolous
purchase there are things that I have
very carefully chosen and I will explain
why the three pieces are all from Luiza
Via Roma it's actually the first time
I've used their website so far very
impressed with the service everything
arrived so quickly considering I think
the pieces come from Italy I've actually
visited the store on Via Roma when I've
been to France before so yeah very
excited to show you what is inside so
let's get started okay so everything has
arrived in this big black box at least I
hope it's everything I know is far fetch
things sometimes arrive differently
because they come from different
retailers but I believe everything is in
here so we have a beautifully presented
package we've got some monochromatic
Luiza via roma ribbon which I'm going to
undo and show you what's beneath this
tissue paper and here are sneak peek for
three pieces that I purchased I'm going
to start off with the big red Valentin
so this is a purchase that I'm very very
excited about if you have watched my
videos previously vlogs etc then you may
have heard me talking about my volunteer
Rockstar shoes which I now have two
pairs they are to this day my most worn
and best investment piece I wear the
shoes so so much and they have very
special memories for me this is not a
third pair of the Valentino rocks to
choose but it is a pair of their sandals
I have been lusting over these are quite
some time and I just thought that this
was the perfect pair and why wait any
longer as I mentioned in my spring
essentials video I do feel that a pair
of sandals is an essential in your
spring wardrobe gets you ready for
summer and also just goes with so many
different outfit combinations so
definitely the kind of piece is worth
investing in inside the box at the top
here we've got to be product information
which is tucked into the dust bag and
here they are so I have gone for the
rose gold I'm not sure the official name
of this leather color but I will leave
the exact pair of shoes linked down
below I would say there are Rosie gold
almost kind of bordering on pewter color
which i think is very very versatile I
think that it's almost like a neutral
and metallic neutral and a lot of my eye
say a lot I don't have that many a few
of my designer bags my Chloe and my
Valentino glam lock bag
they are both metallic and I find that
it just goes with so many things even if
your outfit is a color or if it's
monochromatic this shade this metallic
Goldy color I would say acts as a
neutral and very very flattering on
those different skin tones the height of
the heel I think it's going to be really
versatile it is a low chunky block heel
sorry I can't really see that's a big
loser be a Roma return tag on there very
comfortable to wear I think I'll be able
to wear this all day long if they're
anywhere near as comfortable as my
Rockstar shoes their knees will be
incredibly comfortable I think because
the amount of straps on them they
certainly will be
I'm very much looking forward to trying
these on I think the reason why I
decided that these were worth the
investment is because so many outfits
can instantly be uplifted with a
designer accessory and I think that
Valentino shoes are so iconic so
eye-catching and they instantly just
give your look a bit of a luxe appeal
whether you're wearing a pair of jeans
and
white t-shirts just adding a pair of
sandals like this all Valentina rock
studs or any designer shoes that are
quite iconic instantly just adds that
certain kind of expensive look to your
entire outfit so I'm going to give these
a try now and I'll let you know how they
feel and what they look like on okay so
I've just popped on at the Valentino
shoes as you can see they look
absolutely amazing they did take a
little bit longer to put on than my rock
studs because they do have these two
straps to do up instead of just the one
but it's worth it once they're on I have
done a little walk around the house and
can confirm they are very comfortable
really easy to walk in because of this
heel height okay this next purchase has
not come in a box instead it's just in
this little dust bag and it is from
Prada I'm gonna open it up and show you
straight away so this is the bag that I
have gone for it is a crossbody bag I
find crossbody bags I just wear them so
so much so the reason why I decided to
invest in this bag is because firstly
it's been on my wish list for quite some
time but also I've been getting so much
use out of my Gucci chevron print bag
lately and I just thought it was time to
get something a little bit more updated
and something more appropriate for
spring because the Gucci bag has got
quite a lot of black in there I always
think of it as quite an autumnal /
winter bag and knowing how much use I
get from that I thought if I was to
invest in a spring version of that bag I
would get so much use out of it so
bringing that price per wear write down
this is obviously a neutral color I got
it in white it's got yellow gold writing
for the Prada logo and then a yellow
gold zip as well because it's neutral it
is going to be the kind of thing that
goes hopefully with all of my outfits
also something that I mentioned in my
video when I talk about how to choose
the right investment bag I'll leave that
video linked on the screen and down
below I was very conscious that this is
that kind of textured Saffiano leather
which is really really durable the bag
like this is going to get a lot of use
is going to be worn on an everyday basis
pretty much so I didn't want it to be a
kind of length that would scratch or
mark or damaged easily this is a very
durable textured leather so it's not
gonna get scratched it's not gonna rip
or show any marks as easily as the
softer leather would so that's
definitely something to bear in mind if
you're investing in a bag that you want
to get a lot of
from inside we've got some padding we've
also got a little and I think this is
going to be the shoulder strap in this
very adorable little Prada pouch that's
interesting it's a full-on leather strap
I don't know why I was expecting this to
be a chain strap I think my Gucci one is
half chained half leather don't quote me
on that but this is great because it'll
be very comfortable whether you're
wearing a strapless top or a shirt
it's not going to drag on the skin so
very good ideas have a leather strap and
it is adjustable as well it's got a
little buckle on there so you can clip
this onto the little hooks here or you
could just hold it as a clutch bag you
could even use this as a makeup bag or a
big purse bag within a bag inside it has
got don't know if you can see that very
clearly but that looks a bit like a card
holders you can slot your Oyster card or
credit card in there and then it also
has a big flap pocket as well so big
enough hopefully for my iPhone my
vlogging camera my daily essentials a
pen a little mini notebook maybe so
again knowing how practical I found a
Gucci one I think this will be very
well-loved and very well used my final
splurge was from say neuron and again
this is the kind of bag that I have had
on my Pinterest wishlist on my kind of
mental wishlist for a long time but I
don't know I just never made the splurge
and something recently obviously
happened to us having a bit of a crazy
day decided to go for three in one and
it is I want it open inside there's a
dust bag and here is the bag isn't she
beautiful
I've lusted over the same around back to
the tassel for so so long I do have a
bag slightly bigger than this which
doesn't have a tassel and whenever I see
people with a tassel one I'm like I just
look so so gorgeous this is another
thing that just again instantly uplifts
an outfit if you're wearing a super
plane outfit with a coat or even just
like a chunky knit just wearing this
crossbody it's so iconic and
eye-catching with the wire cell logo
such a timeless design that it's going
to be something that for years and years
and years I can just use as a finishing
touch to my outfit and instantly it just
looks so much more fabulous so we have
got inside again at Louisa Biron love
putting all of these tags on there
there is a very very practical zipper
pocket and then inside you've got one
main compartment and once again this is
like a purse so it's got one two three
four five six card folders card slots
and then a big slot at the back so if
you wanted to use this as like a giant
purse you very much could all your coins
in the zip section you could put all
your notes in the back section and then
fill that area out with your cards - I
can't wait to take all of these labels
off to see how it looks properly this
one has once again a chain strap but a
leather section at the top here love it
when they do this because as I mentioned
earlier it's not chained all the way
around it means it's not going to be
painful on your shoulders so I am
absolutely smitten with my three new
luxury purchases I think all three of
these pieces are great investments I'm
going to get a lot of use out of them in
the coming months to spring and then
they're so classic that I will wear them
for years and years to come
great pieces to add to my luxury
collection all of them are very classic
designs they're not real trend pieces
that are going to go out of fashion
within a few months and when it comes to
luxury pieces I have mentioned this in
previous videos I don't like to go for
really overly on-trend pieces because
when I make this kind of investment I
want to get use out of them for years
and years so it's very important to me
that they are timeless designs and I
think all three of these absolutely are
so let me know in the comments what you
think of my gorgeous new pieces if any
of these are on your wish list or if you
own any of these what you think of them
give me your mini reviews I will keep
you guys updated as to how I get along
with them you'll be seeing them a lot
over on my Instagram and in my styling
videos so keep a lookout for those and
let me know what is on your spring
luxury wishlist as well on that note I
do have a blog post going up today on my

still on my wish list for spring so if
you'd like even more fashion inspiration
then I'll leave a link to that post down
below and you can check that out too
