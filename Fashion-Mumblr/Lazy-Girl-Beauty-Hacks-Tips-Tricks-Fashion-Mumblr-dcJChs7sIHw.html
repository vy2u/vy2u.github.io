hacks video so I looked through all my
old blog posts and which ones were most
popular so if you like to read them
maybe you like to see them um actually
my one of my most popular posts was a
fashion hacks and it was full of all
these silly little tips that I picked up
from just Germany like interning and
being obsessed with fashion actually
that's me that's why I started blogging
was because so many people were like ah
choice you know all these like really
random tricks so I started to blog to
just write them down and share my
experiences but that's a whole nother
story so basically this video is going
to be some beauty tips and tricks some
little hacks things that you'll be like
oh my god I can't even have thought that
before so I have made a little note on
my phone of a few tips and tricks so
here we get them number one you might
already know this but for the whole of
my life I've been using bobby pins the
wrong way around so I've been putting
them in like with the slap I've been
putting them in with a flat bit of the
bottom and that the flat bit on my head
but that's wrong
the bubbly bit goes against your head
because then it has more grip so if you
already knew that but someone taught me
this the other day and I was like mind
blown
crazy times still talking about bobby
pins if you have super Sikh hair lucky
you but you might find that bobby pins
slide out if you use them like I do to
keep the hair when you have a bun then
you might finally slide out so if you
just give them a quick spritz with
hairspray make some sticky and then
don't side out so just give it a push
pop it in and good to go number two my
second Beauty hack is something which
I've actually known for a long time and
then I forgot to do and then I got my
hands on this beautiful little perfume
it's their number 15 and it's the most
it's so nice it's kind of like foodie
Arabi woody um just amazingness and I
absolutely love it I actually dropped
the first bottle when I was taking some
pictures the other day and the first one
that I have this glass I think I
instagrammed will tweeted a picture of
it broken with a really sad face but it
broke now my bedroom smells amazing but
now I have this play bottle but it's
it's amazing amazing perfume I love it
it's my favorite right now but the
lasting power is not as good as from my
other persons
so my next trick is to use Vaseline
don't use pink Vaseline is fully
Vaseline I just couldn't find any
Vaseline put a little bit of Vaseline on
the areas east for your perfume so
behind your ears on your pulse points
just a tiny tiny bit and I don't know
how but it just makes her perfume last
longer which is amazing and it means
that this is flawless and the most
amazing perfume my next beauty hacks are
still with lipstick can you divulge
charlotte tilbury sexy Sienna I love
this and it's actually really
long-lasting by itself but if you have a
problem making your lipstick last longer
and this is a really good trick
everybody knows about and
like normal blotting isn't like tissue
between the lips and makes it last
longer but if you want mega long-lasting
power then
then what you can do is use a
translucent powder I love to my face and
just everything the Antipodes
translucent powder but what you can do
in your lipstick is use a brush but the
tissue or toilet roll if a classy lady
like me pop it on your lips and then
just tap some powder over the top
I have no idea how why that works but it
does and this is a good trick so give
that a try another lipstick trick is the
worst thing in the world is when you
have beautiful lipstick and then you
smile and you got like lipstick on your
teeth never a good look so this is super
simple just your finger in your mouth
and like almost suck on your finger but
like that pull it out and you should be
able to see and on your finger you might
have some lipstick on that but hopefully
that will stop it from going into so you
have lipstick three teeth just always a
winner
ah so going back to Vaseline and there
are just like 900 million things you can
do at a scene and just checking my list
yeah so I have crazy crazy eyebrows now
long in places they don't grow in other
places but Vaseline is a super-duper
thing to use again not the pink one I
really should have found the blue one
but don't don't use the pink one for
this because you look what it got a rash
or something you can use Vaseline to put
it through your eyebrows and then use
something like this this is a tweezer
'men eyebrow brush you can just put
passing on your brows and pin in place
and then you don't need to spend
expensive brow product another tricky
vaccine and you can use the pink one
this time is not really a trick just
something I do I hate having foundation
lips so as soon as I put my foundation
on I will put some vaseline on my lips
because um firstly it stops them being
kind of dry and foundation II like I
don't like that color and also it
prepares your lips for lipstick so you
can use any lip balms and happy
fascinators does that one here but if
you put lip balm on as soon as you
finished your foundation then by the
time it comes to doing your lipstick
which I normally do last and I get
relieved the last thing I do before I
leave the house then your lips will be
fresh and ready to go another thing that
you can do to prepare your lips lipstick
and this little trick was given to me by
one of the amazing makeup artists at
Elizabeth Arden in the House of Fraser
counter they said if you have dry lips
then you can use an old mascara wand or
an old Brown wand at you just you know
the shops when they have like mascara
you can grab two like testers guys use
that to scrub your lips and it really
just exfoliates and gets all the dead
skin off your lips that's some really
really good tips so thank you as the
Varden team because it really really
works and I've been loving bright
lipsticks recently in my lips get very
dry so arm and the brush combo but many
uses the little brush okay so the
toothbrush brush that's so much a
toothbrush can also be used the same
thing as the eyebrow bristled brush
scrubbing your dry lips can also be used
for getting rid of any static hairs that
you might have so if you tie your hair
if you'd like to do like a rescue
ponytail or I really sleep barn and you
get like little wispy bits like I have
them yeah I have sideburns really cool
now and I like to get them out the way
so what sometimes do is I will spray a
toothbrush with hairspray and then just
give it a little local change and and it
just gets everything neatly held down
but without without using too much
spraying and that crispy look so has
brown tooth brush is a great tip oh if
you're going to do the lip thing and the
hair thing and the brow thing I would
definitely recommend getting more than
one toothbrush because that'd be really
gross like just get our plain
toothbrushes they're free my next trick
is something that I've been doing
forever I think since I read it in like
Sabrina's secrets magazine when I was
about nine years old
but anyway so what you can do is fill
some really fluffy socks actually don't
don't fill the socks put loads of body
lotion or foot lotion if you fancy on
your feet
loads of it
put some really fluffy socks on and go
to sleep and when you wake up you'll
have beautifully soft feet no like dry
ankles or anything and feet - it'll
smell amazing I think it's body shop do
a really nice like peppermint foot
lotion I just use like whatever cheap
body lotion I've got lying around
redundance good really works and I just
need some old fluffy socks normal socks
will do but fluffy socks are fun okay so
my next trick is quite a random one if
you are a lover of YSL or similar on
white wire samskaras then you'll love
them but you might be aware that they do
dry out quite quickly and when they are
about to dry out but I'll dry it out
then they can be a bit like um clunky
and how to just dry Charlie so a little
trick which is kind of dorky is too good
to do good put your mascara in your bra
because it warms it up and it just
releases everything and now it's in
silky smooth ready to go so doesn't have
to be a wire Sal mascara but why styles
are expensive and they do try out that's
like one of my major problems with them
if you put it in your bra it warms up
and you're ready to go my next trick is
for nails I saw like a boots thing going
around on Facebook about a hot the whole
like if you get a chipped nail then you
can cut up in a tea bag and put clear
nail varnish haven't actually tried that
but if any of you guys have them please
let me know because that would be a
really cool trick but store an advert
and pretty advert phobic but
magic back to the point is do you ever
want to do your nails in a rush and you
want to do quite thick nail varnish like
blob it all on and you don't want to get
and right now it's done it properly but
you get scuff marks or hairline just
because it's not 100% dry but what you
can do is put your nearly dry nails
under very slowly running cold water
because the water I don't know how they
like cold water it will dry your nail
polish which and mix it I properly dried
so that's a really good trick just when
they're nearly dry under cold running
water not really fast running water just
running water and it will try it now
varnish
another trick not necessarily beauty but
it involves a beauty tool and something
that I've been doing quite a lot
recently in the summer because I've been
wearing more silks and like light
fabrics but I am really really really
lazy and I can never be bothered to iron
stuff or I do iron stuff and then I
shove it in my wardrobe and it gets
little crinkles not to remount my deep
crinkles here I'm talking about those
slight crinkles and silky things get or
if you're wearing stuff a second day and
you want it to like decrease basically I
just blast stuff while I'm wearing it
with my hair dryer and the hottest
setting just stand there like
blow dryer and it just gets rid of the
greases especially if you blow dry and
you like smooth it out I find it's just
so easy and if you've got time if you've
got a shower but you should then you can
hang stuff up and put it in your
bathroom and a steam from the bathroom
wall that helps to let go of the creases
as well that's another good tip and
finally I was watching a video recently
and somebody was saying how when they
finished doing their makeup they spray
their face with hairspray afterwards as
the beauty hack for keeping the makeup
and face now I used to do this when I
was younger as well but then someone
told me that and when you think about it
is really gross because like house spray
is really sticky I don't even want to
think about the ingredients like alcohol
butane method darkness fear whatever it
just doesn't doesn't sound like skin
loving ingredients to me
so one beauty hat which I would not do
is do not fit a sprayer face just invest
maybe like 10 or 12 pounds I think it is
for a setting spray I am a big fan of
Urban Decay makeup setting spray I just
it's really refreshing and
just put a few spritzes on your face
when you're finished your makeup stops
you getting oily stops to getting shiny
it stops and makeup signing off I'm not
putting a load of crap on your face
which you would be doing with hairspray
so don't do this this is not a beauty
hack this is a way to get bad skin this
is just a life saver don't have to get
the oven to keen one I heard the
Victoria's Secret at one that's really
good
I'd love to know if there's any high
street versions because this is not
hugely cheap but I think it's really
good value because I spray like eight
sprays on my face and I can't see that I
think it's in your third gone I think
it's like 12 or 16 pounds and I just
think it's a really good value if you
don't want to keep touching up your
makeup today and you've got half of that
then go for this one really really like
this so that's it that's my beauty hacks
I bet there are millions more out there
and I bet you guys know some really good
ones so I love it if you'd let me know
