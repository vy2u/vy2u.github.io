but these are special edition for the
Olympics let me show you so on the steam
pod you've got this fabulous kind of
birds-of-paradise tropical print which
is rather beautiful but excuse to buy
the steam pot if you haven't tried it

video about it so I'll link that down
below if you're interested in the steam
code last two things this is a new
beauty box called Tilly and I saw this

little introduction to Tilly oh is the
QVC box as interesting qvc.com slash
Tilly very interesting it's like a
little pass the parcel get rid of the
pink fluff wow this is amazing so look
there's a sample of the bareMinerals new
serum which I'm really intrigued to try

think yeah look it's the sample of the
backlight priming filter little sample
of the Vita Liberata phenomenal term
nexus conditioner LMS mice the water
it's so handy for travel look how tiny
that is I'm not sure that is lipstick or
something this is the alpha liquid gold
who I've heard about this is meant to be
amazing
Karim what it is but I've heard good
things and got oh that's so cute I'll be
so good with telling your face little
mitt from suits Liberata
and inside that bubble wrap was a nude
Essie nail varnish so such a usable
color a friends sometimes in these like
monthly boxes you get really crap colors
but that's actually really beautiful I
think that's honestly probably the best
beauty box have seen in quite a long
time genuinely usable very good brands
like very high quality brand products
very impressed with a Tilly beauty and
last but absolutely not least is this
little mystery case there was no
branding on the envelopes so I had no
idea who it's come from but this looks
like lunch box that we had when we did
the benefit remember that blog event
where we were up on the crane dangling
above London that was in my first ever
blog sign and leave that first of a
video rather vulgar video so I'll leave
that link down below so I think this
might be from benefit I know it's not oh
intriguing this is from they've
obviously used the same a lunch box
company oh it's from satin Bell okay
must be like some mass-produced thing
that benefit got it sort of you got here
from OGX oh that's so cute after they've
sent me their sunkissed blonde lemon
highlights shampoo this is a mini one
good for traveling coconut milk very
nice and what have we got down here oh

cute it's a little lime watermelon and a
pineapple so you blow these up and you
can basically use them as drink holders
in a swimming pool which is adorable and

amazing

nice with the suit that must process
that means I'm excited to try them mum
wouldn't normally wear ripped jeans but

year by the from American Eagle so thank
you for those those guys favorite
products from Clarence you guys

good I use that all pretty much every
morning to notice and then I use this
every morning which the moisturizer but
this is the travel size one man so it's
perfect for like my travel bag yeah
and then this watch which is really cool
so it comes with three straps silver so
that's the watch face that's the kind
you're not so sure projects they're
called sure I think they're quite new

last vlog since which I have done work I
said I had a nap yes I had about an
hour-and-a-half nap as I said I was
feeling very tight high so I had a bit
of a nap one of the definite upsides of
working from home is it can nap when you

kiss texture but anyway it's just how to
cut coffee and we're about to go out
didn't fancy brush my teeth because I'm
lazy I'm gonna try why didn't you lush

might be a gross tasting how did you I
can chas try one what so you do that and
