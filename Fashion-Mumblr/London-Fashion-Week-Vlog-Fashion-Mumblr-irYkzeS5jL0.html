some really nice close-up shots to show
you guys the bun but yeah I'm set with
the Loreal Pro mists so absolutely

to leave home took me forever to decide
what to wear today but I've gone with
showing the mirror but I've gone with a
similar kind of Charles at yesterday I
wore kind of paper bag waist and peg leg

ones were pretty cute with a lace top so
I've gone for this little combination my
hair still got a nice little curl in it
from when I had it done at dry by
yesterday so key sunglasses um this top
is
cut remember I'll leave a link down
below and it's got quite a nice high
neck got it tucked into the trousers

Millen bag which I'm actually just
borrowing for Fashion Week I thought was
quite nice kind of Chloe style and then

which are from a brand called carrot
London and I just seen they're so pretty
I've never actually I haven't worn
earrings since so long I had to replace
my ears yesterday morning which was not
the most fun but I just think I'm really
gorgeous and my bracelet from carats I'm
about to actually put on a ring from
them as well which I think I already
showed you not sure and then a coat from
Rhys which is downstairs because I've
designed it so I'll find a mirror later
