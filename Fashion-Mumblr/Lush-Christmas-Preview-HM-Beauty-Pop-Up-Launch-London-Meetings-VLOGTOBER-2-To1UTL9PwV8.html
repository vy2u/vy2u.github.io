it is when Tuesday oh my god
mm it's Tuesday today I'm about to head
out into town I'm going to central
London for a few meetings I've got a
breakfast meeting first thing so I
thought I'd take you along with me I
will show you quickly what I am wearing
today it's quite cool today
but sunny so I'm wearing this roll neck
top which I think you've seen before in
a vlog just from River Island and then
my skirt is a suede black skirt from
Miss Selfridge and then I'm wearing my
Charlotte Olympia cutie flats which I'm
not actually worn out before I've always
kind of won them in the house so I'm
looking forward to you're giving these a
little go I was actually planning on
wearing a black roll neck today this is
a black one from new look but I could
not get it over my head so I've never
had that problem before I don't actually
have a larger than average head where's
the top done here so this is the top and
I can't really show you either one hand
but it's not scratchy and my head is
probably like that big I mean I really
don't have a large an average head but I
could not get my head through that slot
so I'm going to take that back to new
look later today and I'm taking my
Radley backpack I just find it so handy
that it's the backpack cuz that's my bag
for today and I think I'll put on my
River Island great wrench coat so this
is the finished outfit of the day as
always I'll post links to everything
down in the description bar and I'm
running a bit late now so I'm going to
hang
sorry disappointed immediately stop
I know that the question once
not there
the bathroom
that it was just normal so
so I'm just on my second meeting of the
day I am on fashion Street in shortage
and this office is basically the coolest
office I have ever seen a real major
office envy it's the bestseller offices
and they put the load of brands and I've
just come to the via remote area there
are so many nice pieces here to have a
look behind me space so typical shortage
like a cool East London
feel like I don't really belong here but
I'm just going to show you some of these
pieces
the girls got the new gym collection
which really excited to try on another
pre-show you guys
and now
today wishes of a PR company
down the street now an old friends with
lips
someone just came out to and said oh my
gosh you're JC from Paschal mother and
that is literally the first time that
has ever happened to me in my whole life
I don't feel like in any way I'm any
kind of celebrity but being recognized
on the street is definitely a new thing
for me so if you are the person secured
to me you made my day so that meeting
was meant to be hot and our quick chat
button is opening in two hour long
meeting but it's always really nice to
catch up with the girls and come away
with those really nice goodies which I'm
excited to try late
and now I'm going to Liberty it's that
first-ever beauty parlor event so I'm
really looking for suing it goes
smooth aromatherapy associates
yeah pretty nice friend
being closed nodes weird looks I'm going
to put the camera away
see you
back home now and reunited with my
little man who is tucked up I don't know
if you can see bundled up in my jacket
he absolutely loves it when I bundled
him into my clothing sometimes I wrap up
for my dressing gown which you will know
if you follow me on snapchat and he just
absolutely loves it you like to be all
cozy and snuggled up together and so I
have all of this stuff too on package I
think the last time I vlog so I think
the last time I vlogged was when I was
heading into the Liberty event and
basically aromatherapy associates and
Liberty have got together to create a
new bath oil and I'm just going to show
you this it's really really beautiful so
this is their new clear mind bath and
shower gel and this one is actually
personalized not sure if you can see
that not sure if you can see the little
jf on there but they are personalizing
them at the event and the bath oil is
just meant to be all about just 20
minutes of me time and it's got lots of
as you can tell by the name aroma
therapy associates got lots of room
aromatic aromatherapy room aromatic what
that's fun lots of aromatic oils in it
there's lavender frankincense con miles
to lots of things which what are you
doing he's chewing his poo back
obviously not used once that's weird and
yeah lots of oils in it which really
promote mindfulness so relaxation and
being more present in the moment so that
sounds like exactly what I need so I
think I might have a nice that worth
tonight and put a capsule of that in and
this is going to be exclusive to Liberty
as you can see I had a bit of a session
in super try I think I'm gonna film a
whole video with that and a load of
other bits that I picked up today I went
to River Island got some stuff in one of
my tote bags and also big box of miso
stuff arrived today
now I've just got some pasta cooking
because I don't really eaten all day
apart from breakfast but just a lovely
breakfast but didn't really keep me
going all day so I'm gonna stick on some
pasta and then watch some YouTube videos
while I eat it and have a bit in the
early nights as an early start tomorrow
because lots two days I'll see you guys
in the
morning guys I've just got to observe
surface we didn't have time to start the
blog I heard like I normally do
and in favor brush how could you do like
a little outfit day I'm wearing this
jumper dress which is Bachman warehouse
kind of like three-quarter sleeves and
got my Radley backpack skillful and I
just watch the camera two jokes I'm with
Jody probably already know all the bad
jokes and we are we are just waiting now
for judges stressful and we're about to
go to the lush events and what
we're gonna go and see what luck Chicago
in winter and then I don't know what
we're doing but yeah
been given this little map which is on
that food store we're gonna get around
all the different stations
pretty funny sign no cursing
I beg nor I never tried it and it's
really nice it's my creamy not thank you
like I thought it's gonna be even stable
so just made cleanser that now for
example sushi which really pleased to me
and we are now getting a lip to the
bottom floor really start going around
all stations
just got back home I didn't vlog after
we left lush event because the bag that
they gave us this bag you can see behind
me and that ginormous that I basically
had that in one hand my handbag in the
other so I couldn't vlog so apologies
for that
but Becker and and I basically went to a
meeting together which is lovely got a
few bits and bobs to try out but home
now and I didn't show you my dress
properly earlier or at least I tried but
I think I've never fail but I'll show
you now quickly the dress I've been
wearing today so it's this really nice
dress from where is it from
I can't remember where it's from but I
will link it down description box below
looks kind of shapeless but actually
it's really nice and it's really snuggly
and I've been wearing it okay obviously
I haven't been wearing it with my
slippers and socks all day I was going
with my rest and bromley highlight boots
looking like a bit of a Bobby Dazzler
with my slippers and sucks on now but
you know does anyone else see Bobby
Dazzler or is there something that my
mom made up she makes up so many words
that I never know what is a real word or
what is a word that she made up and
anyway let's have a look at the lush
Christmas set so this is there under the
mistletoe set and I chose this one there
was a couple to choose from because it's
got quite a wide range of products in it
and I've never really tried that much
from lush before other than bits that
I've been given for Christmas so I
thought it'd be quite nice test a set so
let's have a little look what's inside
hey they make the pulp and the box is
running and I decided I'm going to try
out this we know we nut facemask it's a
loose writing I mean it's a sheet mask
Simon look please I'm gonna try this I
knew like something out of Texas
Chainsaw Massacre or something business
they're funny I actually feels like a
really nice it's it right now feel like
a really good quality version of these
sheet masks but there's so many of them
on the market but this one you recon tub
is really thick it feels like felt or
something on my face so I'm gonna go
with this one and it's one of the Blues
stolen so I showed you earlier so gosh
very hard sometimes but yeah owners are
start it's got a little clip on it so
we're gonna go with this one
let's drop it in okay I think starting
me to fizz
maybe this isn't a bath but maybe this
is a virus code for something we'll do I
break it up there we go what it was
enough is okay this is definitely a bath
bomb let's get this one ago
so again I've just come to brick lane
towards the old Truman brewery for the
launch of hmm beauty bound that confused
because Asian beauty has already
launched I've already done all you ever
seen on my channel there's a party
