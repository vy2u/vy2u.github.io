the Maldives today so I thought I'd pick
up the vlogging camera didn't vlog too
much yesterday because we're just
totally unwinding and relaxing so we're
here at the Conrad hotel for the first
full day's of our Maldivian adventure
currently we are doing the daily commute
which is this super long bridge which
connects the two islands we've just had
a fantastic breakfast in the quiet zone
restaurant which is the restaurant on
the water filler island fabulous
breakfast I had pancakes charlie had a
nice healthy omelette overlooking the
beautiful turquoise ocean there is going
to be a perfect day really I'm about to
go to the spa going to get a lovely one
three five treatments so that's one of
the signature treatment here at the
Conrad and Charlie is going to head to
the gym he's over there somewhere
and he's going to do oh my goodness Wow
flying fish going on behind me
yeah choy skinheads the gym the gym here
is really really nice I will probably
take you in there at some point over the
next couple of days he's going to do a
workout and then we're going to meet for
a nice healthy lunch so let's get going
very zen after my treatment so I just
had the signature 135 treatment at the
spa here on the main island there are
two stars as Conrad the one I went to is
the biggest one so I started off by
being shown around and all of the
treatment rooms are on these little
water bungalows and stilts above the
ocean which is a very unusual spot
location and my treatment started off
with a body scrub so I had a telomere
for Elemis products I had a fine scrub
all over the body and then I showered
that off in an outside shower before
having a really lovely oil massage with
a lot of focus on the scalp and I've got
loads of coconut oil in my hair now
which is going to leave to sink in and
then I went on the beach for an hour or
so a little bit of reading
Charlie has now joined me would you do
this going going oh my did Jim had a
good Tim session have the gym to myself
which is always nice then I have a nice
walk back to the deluxe allow 2020 fund
and look in the Sun which is nice and
then did a little bit of round stuff and
photo everything home had a shower
mckimie it's a hard life and so we're
now at the mandu restaurant I think it's
called and this is the kind of organic
star restaurant and we've got a pretty
epic lunch location good
so it's been a couple of hours since I
logged Charlie and I spent the afternoon
sunbathing on the beach we went off
doing yeah it was a very tough day we
went to the quiet zone which is on the
water bungalow island and we just laid
by the beach dunked in the water with
our giant watermelon and then we went
back to that we've got change we've got
showered I'm looking a little Rouge and
we're now off to hopefully watch the
sunset hopefully we've not missed it and
then we're having a beach barbecue
tonight enormous because real life well
anyway so tell us what's going on tunas
not going so we are going if I look geez
that's quite close one there we go we
are going for a beach barbecue on on the
beach of the sleep right on the island
near our villa and it loves that and
champagne so obviously I won't be
drinking the champagne but Josie won't
be eating the lobster so it works I get
her lobster she gets my champagne so
it's going to be a nice evening I think
it was a bit of a downfall but never
mind
so we've now got the beach and our table
is right on the edge of the water or
about to go and help ourselves to an
unlimited evening of champagne and
lobster
the
you
good morning they're not to show how
much you can hear because we are on a
speedboat
but say we had a really early start
we had breakfast in the room which is
lovely breakfast on all get one are
definitely fabulous I have pancakes the
healthy ocean mansion scrambled egg free
yogurt granola
and then we suppress the dive sensor and
we've got all of our kit now and we're
about to go on a snorkeling trip so one
that the island the Conrad speedboat and
it's going to go through different reef
and
you're kind of calm yes we can
Oh
hmm
so we've had a very chilled afternoon we
we went to the underwater restaurant
earlier which was rather incredibly we
had little baby shark swimming above us
as we had champagne and canapés that
was really really fab experience and
then we spent the afternoon on the beach
enjoying the sunshine and now it's about
quarter past six or the sea plane and if
you can see it about the lands behind me
sadly we're going to be on one of those
tomorrow it's our final evening but
we're about to beat yoga and hence the
outfit so yeah I'm talking very quietly
because there's no JAMA beach the whole
place to ourselves
so that sad time has come it's Hospice
six in the morning and as you might
guess here behind me that over there
somewhere is our seaplane here to whisk
us away and anyone has been small these
will know the sound of your seaplane
coming is enough to bring on tears so we
don't want to leave that's for sure but
luckily our trips to the Maldives is not
over we've got a couple more fabulous
experiences to have here I'm going to
leave this log here been an amazing
amazing amazing four days at the Conrad
can't wait to share all about it over
the blog I'll leave a link to my post
down below and I'll see you my next
small business
I shut my eyes trying not to be pretend
Adam I smell your breath honey
but I still hear your screams if we do
you hear what I'm saying and the closet
in beyond those days the last I can feel
I can notice the focus
breaking out from my life as we know it
then I will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
