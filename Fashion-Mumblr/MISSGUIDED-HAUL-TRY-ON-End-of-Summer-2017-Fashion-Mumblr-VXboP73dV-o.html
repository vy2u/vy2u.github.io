me for today's video which is the last
video in fashion Mangala hall week so I
really hope you guys enjoyed all the
hauls that have been on my channel this
week I will leave every single one of
them linked down below we've had Zara
we've had Primark we've had River Island
Topshop we've had a premium haul with
like Club Monaco Karen Millen Rhys even
a supporter so huge huge host of hauls
on my channel this week I really hope
you guys have enjoyed them today's haul
is going to be misguided and actually
ironically it's the most summary of all
of the horse because I'm going on
holiday next week to Italy and I did
want to pick up a few more summery
pieces so without further ado and let's
get started
this first piece could actually be worn
as an autumnal piece as well because it
is long sleeved and fairly thick fabric
but I spotted this on the site it looked
absolutely beautiful on the model
because of this gorgeous detailing on
the sleeves I just love a good sleeve
detail I love a fluted sleeve this one
is more Flair than fluted I would say
but I have to say this looks pretty big
I think it must have been pinned on the
model on the site because this was a
smaller size available this is so small
but it does look quite big and I feel
like it could look a little bit 10t on
me I'm Sun overlay now of me trying on
so you can see how big it looks but I
think this might be a big but it's a
shame because the detail on the sleeves
is so pretty and just a really nice way
to elevate quite a plain white top next
up is another white piece I think they
are this is another top and this one
looks like a little bit more successful
than the last this one is quite
Victoriana style it's got a really high
collar a high neck and then you've got a
zip going all the way down the back to
let yourself in and out this detail I'm
gonna convert closest you can see it
this kind of detail here there's like
lace with the with the baubles if that
makes sense really reminds me of
self-portrait I have quite a lot of
self-portrait styles that have that same
kind of detailing on it and I definitely
think that wearing this will give off
the effect a really high-end top but I
think this is around 20 pounds if that's
so very very impressed with that
again I'll show you what it looks like
on also really like this almost
peplum style lace at the bottom so it
should have a really lovely feminine
shape to it so I think are we wearing
that quite a lot on my upcoming holiday
I also wanted to pick up a new pair of
denim shorts my holiday if you watched
my previous holiday lookbook so you'll
know that I was wearing so so so much
this pair from French Connection with
some like stitching on them and I adore
them but you guys are starting to get a
bit annoyed because they are sold out so
I thought I'd get a new pad but I can
wear and that won't be sold out this
pair I think they're absolutely adorable
they're covered in pearls I love pearls
and they are really nice and
high-waisted as well fingers crossed
these fit the only thing that I'm
thinking is they are very short I know
denim shorts normally hot pants they go
up your bum a little bit but what I
loved about the French Connection ones
was that they were a little bit longer
so you didn't have quite so much crotch
or balm on display but these are gonna
be pretty short
I'll give them a go and yeah fingers
crossed I can get away with it so this I
thought was a really nice transition
piece if like me you're going on any
holidays in the late summer then this is
a really nice way of getting some more
tonal colors into your holiday wardrobe
so it is play suit it goes around the
neck like a halter neck and then you've
got this kind of open cold shoulder
detail as I mentioned the colors are
fairly or tumble you've got these
beautiful vivid red flowers and then it
is a little short play suit which I just
absolutely love that style of play suit
and I think it's nicer when they're
shorts than a skirt
and because you can get away with
Manxman bit shorter and it's not so
revealing it's also got a lovely keyhole
detail in the back here so you'll get a
little bit of your tanned back showing
through and then once again it has got
this self portrait style laddering down
it which again I think it gives it a
really lovely slightly more higher-end
look to it so fingers crossed this will
look lovely on definitely one I think
I'll be wearing a lot in my upcoming
trip to Italy right the next thing is a
pair of shoes I find it really funny
when they don't bother like putting them
in their own shoe box because we all
know that these shoes are going to be in
multiple retailers all made in the same
Chinese factory but they don't even
bother changing the factory name off the
box so that's very funny but and I
picked up this pair of espadrilles that
was such a ramble
pick it up this pair of espadrilles I
really love the blush color of them I
love that they are meals and espadrilles
two of my favorite shoe styles and then
they have got this stud detail on a toe
which is a little bit Valentino esque
just gives them a slightly more higher
and feel these are the kind of shoes
that you'll just slip on so regularly
while on holiday I thought they'd be
very practical and I get tons of use out
of them so this is actually the top that
made me make the order I saw it on the
new in section and I thought it looked
beautiful so striking in photos which
not gonna lie is what spurred me to get
it
it's a weird neoprene material but it is
a bandeau top it doesn't help but I'm
wearing right now so you can't really
see the shape of it apart from the weird
material I think this is a really
effective top so it's kind of like a
boob tube but with this almost paper bag
style hem hem or neckline at the top
here I think because the material is so
stretchy it doesn't even have any
fastening so like the way that this has
been made is so so simple if I had the
time or the effort I could probably make
this myself it's literally just pleated
fabric and one line of stitching that's
all it is because the fact it's neoprene
the rest of the edges have just been cut
and actually they've not been cut very
straight if you can see they're really
not terribly good quality at all but
what you expect when you're paying like
12 quid for a top and I don't know I
mean it is a shame that the quality is
quite low but it's gonna look cute in
photos so probably gonna be a keeper we
have another darker colored item here I
really am pushing the boat out this is a
silky playsuit Beach cover-up I thought
this would be the kind of thing you can
stick on it over bikini or swimsuit when
you're going for lunch that kind of
thing really lovely lightweight
materials if it's nice and warm then you
won't get too hot and sweaty in this by
the way everything I picked up is
usually in the smallest size available
on the site this does however look quite
low-cut so you're gonna have to be very
happy to have your bikini on show
material is really lovely and then
you've got once again a trumpet style
sleeve quite a short little play suit
once again that but when you've got nice
brown legs you don't really mind and
then you've got a tiny at the way
so you can create a lovely flattering
figure really really like the print on
this it's like a paisley tie effect and
I can't wear black just does not suit me
but Navy I feel like is a dark color but
I can get away with so this is another
piece you can just stick on on a holiday
really easy to pop on sits so
elasticated and it isn't off the showed
up showed up shoulder at Bardot style
top again I absolutely adore this print
it is a deep burgundy kind of brownie
color with us almost Indian style Henri
kind of pattern on it nice not thomna
but still a summer piece so fabulous for
transition time again I got these size
six in this one I think this is going to
be once again the kind of piece you take
on holiday and just wear so much it is
so easy to fling on if you don't want to
probably get dressed in the morning you
want to go down for breakfast or you
want to pop something on after spending
the afternoon by the pool then this is
going to be a really lovely piece for
this
I think you'd almost call this like a
scarf print I can imagine and a very
expensive scarf having this print on it
maybe a Hermes or something along those
lines so yeah hopefully this is not too
short on me but once again when you're
on holiday doesn't really matter so yeah
very impressed with that one looks like
I accidentally got two of the scuba not
very well made Bardot tops so that's
gonna have to go in the return pile and
then we've got two more pieces this is
another bit that I was really excited
about so this is a swimming costume
which is wow really big it looks huge
it's an extra small but that looks
really wide hopefully this fit so I will
let you know in that overlay but yeah it
is of course inspired by the kini
bikinis actually we say that just
because kini is the most expensive run
that does it or the most well-known but
they may not been first so yeah sorry if
someone else invented this crochet style
before kini what I have noticed is it
does have little slits here and it does
have a bit of padding so if you wanted
to add some more padding then you could
do that but yeah a crochet style white
swimming costume I love some in costumes
and feel much more comfortable in them
this one's got a lovely low back yes the
quality is really not there
it is obvious it's a lot cheaper than
the keaney ones as in like all the
stitching is not even the right color
and it's very visible but it shouldn't
be too obvious when the bikini or summit
costume is on and you should still get a
really lovely effect from this
especially if you just want this design
style if like me you really love the
style then it's a really nice affordable
way of banking that trend and last but
not least I picked up a pair of
sunglasses as I mentioned in my how to
accessorize video which I'll leave
linked up here and I always like to take
a folder wall or an affordable pair of
sunglasses with me on holiday because if
I'm wearing a pair that's slightly more
expensive then I want to go and see I
get salt in them or worst case scenario
I lose them I get very very upset so I
like to take an affordable pair with me
I wanted to treat myself to a new pair
just because I have worn my other ones
so many times and I really like the pink
tortoiseshell on these ones so it's that
typical kind of tortoiseshell design but
the color is actually more of a light
pink and the brown so nice soft color
these I think were about 8 pounds so
really affordable let's give them a
quick try I always go for like a cat eye
shape because I feel like that suits my
face shape the best and yes these are
quite big but I do feel pretty glamorous
in them so yeah I really really like
those it says total UV protection as
well so you're not missing out on a
protection they come with a little
sunglasses case which is made from like
an absorbent material so it could double
up as you're cleaning cloth as well so
that's a really good idea from misguided
so that's everything that I picked up in
my name is misguided haul I really hope
