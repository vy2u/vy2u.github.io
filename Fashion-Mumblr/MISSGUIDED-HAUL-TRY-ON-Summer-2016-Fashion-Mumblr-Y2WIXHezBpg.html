is going to be the first video in my
whole week series so I've been buying
quite a few things recently from the
likes of estas misguided a Primark H&amp;amp;M
boots even a us shopping haul so I
decided this week as part of my vlog 'us
video every day during month of August
series I thought I would just cram them
all into one week because I know you
guys like holes I love filming them so I
thought I would just do the more in one
go so I'm going to kick things up today
with a misguided haul and misguided for
me is one of these retailers which is a
little bit hit-and-miss sometimes I just
go for months and months at a time and I
don't really like anything on the
website but recently there were a few
pieces that just really caught my eye
and inspired me to do a hold haul so I'm
going to share those with you in this
video first slight disclaimer about my
eyebrows they are in the growing
backstage at the moment so I can't
really do anything with them so sorry if
they're a little bit scary and if you
want a daily running commentary on how
they recovering then check out my
snapchat because I have been doing
regular updates on there if you have got
a clue what I'm on about I will leave a
video about my micro bleeding process
down below so you can catch up on a
catch for my overall defense that's what
you want so onto misguided this is my
bag off shopping it looks really big but
that's because there's a couple pairs of
shoes in there and I'm also going to try
things on for you and let you know what
I think about the fit the quality etc
etc so without further ado let's get
started the first thing that I pulled
out of the bag is a set of pajamas and
if you've been following maybe my
for most videos if you follow those way
back last December then you may
recognize this design or maybe you just
recognize it anyway but basically this
white silky material with the black
piping around the collar and around the
pocket is very similar to a rather
expensive pajama company called Olivia
van house or a set of pajamas from a
designer called Olivia van hull which I
was very very fortunate to be gifted
from Clarins with my initials here at
Christmas but when I saw these I just
thought what an amazing Jew
so the Olivia run how I'm sure that over
300 pounds but these were I think around
the 20 pound mark they don't have the
prices on the tags annoyingly but I'll
leave all the information to all the
products down below but these are
incredibly similar design wise they
don't have the shirt style cuffs at the
bottom with the buttons and the properly
finished sleeves but I think the sake of
saving 280 pounds I can definitely deal
with that quality wise obviously they're
not silk but they do feel really lovely
and lightweight so that's the top and
then these are the bottoms I actually
have full-length trousers of the Olivia
about health dramas and whereas these
shorts with a black piping and little
bow are just more suitable for summer
pajamas so let's give these a try and
I'll let you know what I think of them
feels rather weird wearing pajamas in
the daytime but already I absolutely
love these from afar especially it looks
so similar to the very expensive pajamas
love the design details are private on
the collar and on the pocket and I
really like that they're shorts well
this little bow is really really cute
although it has come undone already but
yeah really really nice lightweight
material for summer love their shorts as
well so you're not going to get too hot
in bed definitely definitely definitely
keeping these pajamas they are my
favorite thing I've picked up from
misguided in quite a long time so yeah
big favorite next is a very tiny looking
pair of white high-waisted palazzo
trousers so these are going to be really
beautiful wide leg trousers they're
flare style and hopefully they're just
going to fit really really beautifully
the material is
a little bit stretchy so it's going to
be nice and accommodating for summer
barbecues but I find this style of top
just so beautiful with either a t-shirt
or a strappy top you can go really wild
with the design of your strappy top I've
got a topless kind of caramel burgundy
and black stripes and I think that would
go beautifully with these I actually did
have a Topshop pair but I've worn them
quite a lot and because they're white
the bottoms have got a little bit
stained so I thought these would be a
really lovely alternative they don't
have a zip or anything so hopefully
they're stretchy enough to fit over my
bum but anyway let's give them a try and
see how they fit really love how these
palazzo trousers feel is so comfortable
thanks to this stretchy material however
I'm not sure it's a terribly flattering
I have got back on the macaroni teasers
lately which means I'm not terribly
comfortable with how tightly on my
thighs also very revealing on my bottom
so happy very careful what underwear I
wear and having so that they're so
comfortable and I can see myself wearing
these quite a lot with loads of
different summer outfits I think with a
really summery camisole top these will
just look absolutely gorgeous I'm going
to try and pan down so you guys can see
how they fit on the ankles as well next
up is a pair of shoes and these are one
of the items that really inspired the
whole the whole haul because they are
very Valentino asked but without that
ginormous price tag I absolutely love
finding things that are quite similar to
design a product but at a much cheaper
price there when I saw these I couldn't
really resist them design wise obviously
these square studs are very reminiscent
of the designer and Valentino shoes as
is this style of strap but Valentino
shoes are not so clunky they don't have
a chunky heel they have a stiletto or a
very small
Sandeul sides here like moving inch or
so but either way these are definitely
inspired by Valentino rock studs and
they are my favorite designer shoe I
find them just so beautiful so
flattering so for if I could get a high
street version that I'm sure to get a
lot of use out of them as they're nude I
think they're going to be really
flattering very leg lengthening and I'm
sure get a lot of use out of them the
heel is very very high and they don't
have much of a platform but the leather
feels quite squidgy so hopefully they'll
be comfortable so I'm gonna have a
little walk around the knees and to let
you know so I've been walking around the
house in these heels for about half an
hour now and can confirm that they are
incredibly comfortable I think they look
absolutely gorgeous from this angle as
well especially from the front very
Valentino s but yeah really big fan of
these such a good price
definitely definitely keeping these
shoes I absolutely love them next I've
got another pair of trousers I'm not
sure if you can see from that far away
but these ones have got a really bubbly
texture they're kind of like a crepe
material to be honest I think I prefer
the texture of that first pair of
trousers so I probably won't keep both
these look like a much more relaxed fit
as well potentially not quite so
flattering I'm not going to completely
disregard them until I've tried them on
so then let's have a little look not
quite such a good fit on these ones
they're really quite baggy around the
top here having said that I do prefer
these aren't slip on and that they have
got the zip and button detail the
material I can't really decide it is
quite unusual having spotty texture but
then I don't have anything like this in
my wardrobe and I do feel like with
white palazzo trousers I'm gonna get a
lot of use out of them but do I need two
pairs so let me know which one is your
favorite this next one is quite a risky
design choice for me it's quite unusual
it's a neoprene body with a thrill top
so the reason why I got it is because I
really love this frill top feature
really love it in white I think it looks
incredible with the tan you might
remember a jumpsuit I picked up a little
while ago I'll leave a photo on the
screen here and that was also
from misguided and I love it so much I
wear all the time on holiday and this
kind of reminded me of that but I
thought it would look gorgeous with
jeans perhaps or with high-waisted denim
shorts and just not so keen on the whole
neoprene fabric it's just such a weird
texture but then having said that
looking at it from afar you can't really
tell so hopefully this will be quite
flattering let's give it a try
I think this top is really cool it's
such an unusual design I've not seen
anything else like this before I am a
little bit worried about it coming down
revealing too much I'm sure is that
feeling and I think it actually looks
really cool just with normal jeans I've
got dark pair of denim jeans from the
back it's also pretty nice especially if
you've got a tan quite back cleavage II
and but yeah this is not something I
would normally pick up it's completely
different to anything else to go in my
wardrobe doesn't really bother me when
I'm wearing it at its neoprene in fact
it actually makes it pretty comfy
size-wise I say this is quite tight on
my tummy so if you are thinking about
two different sizes then maybe go size
up but design wise I think this is
really really cool another pair of shoes
and I've just got these out of box and
already I am in love with them these
again very very inspired by Valentino
but the actual design of them how they
don't have lip lock bits and they have
this strap going on the ankle Valentino
don't make any exactly like this they're
not a full-on copy and whereas I have
seen some which are pretty much
identical but Sam is definitely inspired
by Valentino again they've got this
beautiful gold square studs and I just
think they're going to look absolutely
gorgeous I think I'll wear them in the
UK a lot with jeans so just look
beautiful but if you've got any holidays
coming up then these are going to be
such beautiful beach sandals I really
hope they're comfortable and easy to
walk in because I think I would get a
lot of use out of these absolutely love
these sandals I think they look so much
more expensive than what they actually
were incredibly comfortable
I think I wear them quite a lot with
jeans with these ripped denim hem so it
really really cute the only thing is
that I do wish that they were flip-flops
because I find it a little bit more
secure if I have something between my
toes and
than that and I do know that not
everybody likes flip-flops so these will
be comfy for everybody just personally I
think I'd feel a little bit more secure
the fastening is a little bit unusual as
well but yeah I really really like them
think they look a lot more expensive
than they were and I'm definitely going
to get a lot of use out of these next
I've got another band Oh free top item
and this is actually a jumpsuit it's
going really really hard for me to
explain it while sitting down so I'm
just going to go straight on and try
this home really like this jumpsuit it
definitely needs an iron before I wear
it out because this ruffle has got quite
a few creases on it wasn't actually
expecting it to be so tight on the legs
but I think it's actually more
flattering how it comes down really
tight close to the ankle and it's very
figure hugging all the way down I think
again this is one we're gonna have to
think quite carefully body underwear
it's probably quite obvious what color
underwear I'm wearing right now but
again with a town this when it's going
to look absolutely dying I think you
could also get quite warm on holiday
with the fabric being so close to your
legs so maybe late summer holidays and
it's bit cooler in the evening you've
still got a gorgeous tan this will be
absolutely perfect I really really like
this one and it's very flattering the
next thing I picked up was a rose gold
clutch bag this kind of reminded me of
the clutch box that whistles bring out
every year some really handy size it has
got these little rings here for putting
it over your shoulder hopefully there's
going to be a shoulder strap inside yes
there is a chain shoulder strap um and I
find these just really really handy in
this color in particular I find goes
with a load of things in my wardrobe my
wardrobe is fairly neutral Pink's Browns
White's so rose gold
lucky for me goes with everything and
alot of my jewelry is rose gold as well
aside from that it could also be used as
a makeup bag there's definitely enough
room in there for your makeup bag and
there's also an inside pocket and a
mobile phone a little pouch as well so
very really good design and I'm not
terribly sure if I like the really
obvious bumps I think this is called
like a Stoney leather or
had a leather effect obviously at this
price it's not real leather but yeah I
think this is a really handy bag to have
and I'm pretty sure I will get a lot of
use out of this I have a feeling this
next one is a really good example of me
falling for a product that looks amazing
on the model and then when it turns up
you're a little bit disappointed but
hopefully when I try this on I will
prove myself wrong because I really want
to love this one it's a very lightweight
material pale blue jumpsuit so you've
got this camisole style top the straps
annoyingly aren't adjustable so I feel
like this may be where it falls down and
that they're not going to be only going
to be a little bit too long for me
because they're going to look really
beautiful at the back this is delicate
crossover design and then it continues
down into wide leg trousers I just not
got a good feeling about this I think
it's going to look slightly strange when
I try it on but anyway let's give it a
go I actually like this jumpsuit a whole
lot more than I thought I was going to
because that'll teach me for him jumping
to conclusions I was right about straps
own straps definitely taken up by that
an inch somehow to hold them to stop you
guys from seeing my underwear and what I
do really like this material I feeling
it's very lightweight nice for evenings
in the Greek islands and things like
that
so really good one for holiday hello
Dexter Dexter is now making his bed on
my beautifully ordered part of clothes
but we're sleep into it and the bottom
they are a little bit long for me so I
will definitely have to take them up an
inch or so even with these shoes on
which are pretty much as high as I
probably go
and I think accessory wise it may be a
belt
perhaps a ring belt just to really add a
little bit more shape to the silhouette
and finally lurking at the very bottom
of my massive shopping bag
were these teeny tiny little shorts and
they're in a blue crack material so a
really lightweight material and they've
got this adorable scalloped design over
at the bottom here to be honest
once again I'm not terribly impressed by
the quality of these as expecting them
to be a little bit silkier and but then
having
that I do wear shorts like this around
the house in summer on my house gets
really really hot I'm wearing a pair of
just lightweight shorts right now so
these are kind of thing that I probably
would get a lot of wear out of so let's
give them a try and see how they look
I'm not entirely convinced with these
shorts I feel like the fit is really
really good but I'm just not terribly
impressed with them as I said I have got
quite a lot of pairs of shorts so I just
don't feel like these really make the
cut
love the color I think maybe if they
were in whites they'd be even better
because then they go really well with
the tan and but for me I just don't need
another pair of shorts so not too you
sure about these let me know what you
guys think and that's everything so
hopefully you'll agree I picked up some
really fab items from misguided wasn't
expecting to find so many pieces which I
really love and it disproves you can
shop from cheaper stores and still get
that high-end look so let me know what
your favorite products are in this haul
is the shoes the trousers or jumpsuits
let me know which are your favorites if
there are any things that you're not too
sure about the maybe I should send back
let me know because I'd love to know
what you guys think of my calls it's
like having loads of best friends in the
room thing like yes or no holding up the
signs like in Sex in the City so let me
know I'm filming this on the day it goes
live so I've got plenty of time
for returns misc I did have a really
short policy I think it's only 14 days
but either way it only arrived this
morning so yeah let me know what your
favorites were and let me know which
haul you'd like to see next so I'm
playing on filming them all well if I
can today so let me know which one you'd
like to see next as I said I've got
Primark hmm and a sauce all here waiting
for me so let me know what you'd like to
see if you did enjoy this video then
please give it a thumbs up thumbs up for
more hauls and yeah subscribe if you are
