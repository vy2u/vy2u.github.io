channel thank you so much for joining me
for today's video which is going to be
yet another misguided haul so as you
probably know if you have been watching
my videos recently is that I've been
getting a little bit spendy and I have
been doing all kinds of hauls a sauce
River Island Topshop H&amp;amp;M Primark you
name it and to be honest I've been
really pleasantly surprised by misguided
recently it's not a retailer that I've
shopped in a huge amount in the past
I've kind of not really found anything
that's to my style but at the moment
they seem to be absolutely smashing it
and to be honest to you this time of
year always gets a little bit spendy for
me as does any kind of change in season
time and right now as we move into
September October it's most definitely
the biggest change in season as we move
from summer to autumn so there's my
justification for all of these holes I'm
not gonna ramble too much because I know
these videos can get quite long but
before I get into it please do subscribe
if you're new to my channel and like
these kind of haul videos because I do
quite a lot often two or three a month
as well as beauty travel and other
fashion videos so definitely subscribe
if you're new and that further ado let's
see what I picked up from misguided oh
okay so this is my shopping bag it's
very large in fact I think this is
probably the biggest misguided order
I've ever done so let's just dig in and
see what I picked up so first of all I
have this blue playsuit and as you can
see here it is a Bardot style on the top
which is just so in fashion at the
moment as is this V shape so I don't
know if it's just like an American thing
but I keep seeing pieces from the likes
of revolve having this cool vdl on the
chest area and personally I think
really nice design detail really
flattering and I also really really like
this color now this is not the terribly
autumnal piece after me saying that this
hall is for the changing seasons I don't
think is too late to wear a few more
summery pieces if you've got any end of
summer holidays coming up then this
could be a really really nice one I'm
hoping this is gonna fit well so without
further ado let's give it a try so I'm
going to do my trying on bits in this
video because I feel like it's a little
bit more informal and we can really have
a chat as though you're right here with
me in my bedroom helping me decide what
to keep so as you guys know the first
thing that I've picked out of the bag is
this jumpsuit and I really really like
it the way that I'm standing is making
this not fall in the middle but it's
quite flattering how it just shows a
little bit of cleavage obviously I'm
wearing the wrong bra I should be
wearing a strapless bra maybe one that
slightly does push the old boobs
together a little bit but yeah I think
this is really lovely for like end of
summer if you've got any more holidays
it's a good length as well it does fall
around the right length for my ankles
really like this and not too expensive
for such a statement piece
so first item that I've tried on is a
success next is a pair of jeans and I
actually picked up a few pairs of jeans
in this haul one of my favorites ever
pairs of jeans that fits me the nicest
is from misguided about a year and a
half ago maybe not even that long ago
but I do remember that misguided jeans
fit me really really nicely so I decided
to pick up a couple of pairs I will show
you all of them with the aim of keeping
one maybe two depending on how nice they
are these ones are a really lovely dark
wash but without being too dark I can't
really get away with almost black denim
really dark it doesn't really suit me
but these do have some nice fading done
Center the legs and also some rips but
without being too ripped as we're coming
into winter
if I wear ripped jeans my knees just get
really cold so I have not gone from the
full-on rip but just some subtle rip
detailing so for me with jeans is all
about the fit so let's give these a try
and hopefully they will be a keeper
these are the ripped jeans in a size 4
the rips are actually a little bit
bigger than I was expecting I guess when
you put them on the rips do get a little
bit stretched I'm
actually really surprised how well the
size four fits
I like how tight they are they do have a
little bit of elasticity in them which
makes them really comfy I actually don't
think I'm going to bother trying on the
size six because I definitely don't feel
restricted in the size Falls feel like
I've got lots of room for like I don't
know they just feel incredibly
comfortable the only thing is I do wish
the rips were a bit smaller but let's
see the other style because I think
another style does have smaller rips I
also like that despite how slim they are
they have real pockets sometimes I find
quite annoying if the pockets are sewn
up and I think the bomb is quite
flattering as well
it's got fading in all the right places
I'm quite happy with how my bum looks
and yeah I do like how high-waisted they
are I think they're just a really
flattering style potentially a little
bit long so I might be tempted to give
them a quick snip so let me know if you
think I should do that or if you guys
have any experience with a fray I don't
know let me know what you think I should
do I also decided to pick up this pink
blazer now I've never actually bought a
blazer before and I know that they are
meant to be icons in your wardrobe
really kind of like wardrobe essential
pieces but I never had one
personally I've got fairly broad
shoulders so I didn't really think that
I could pull off the Blazer but it's
something I'm really keen to try this
year so why not start with something
affordable from misguided and when I saw
this blush color I thought it could not
be more me so as you can see you've got
this dull breasted button detail you've
got these two or full buttons across the
chest area and then kind of tailored
shoulders but they've got a little bit
of padding in not too much and then also
this button detail on the sleeve I'm
really excited to try this I have no
idea whether it's going to suit me or
not so let's have a look Oh guys I
wanted this to work so badly I just feel
like there's something wrong with this I
don't know if it's because I just don't
really suit this whole really
professional look that it's giving it's
quite tailored it's quite big on the
arms I feel like it should maybe I don't
know there's something weird going on in
this kind of area as well I just don't
think I'd get any use out of it I think
if I maybe still had an office
and I needed to wear a blazer to be
smart sometimes and maybe just be really
nice the color of it certainly is
absolutely beautiful but sadly I just
don't think this is something that I
need in my wardrobe also picked up a
pair of grey shorts so these are
actually a lot shorter than I was
expecting but I really like the detail
in the waist they're kind of that paper
bag tie waist which I find really really
flattering a black and leg-lengthening I
picked these up in a size 4 which I
think may be a little bit optimistic I
think perhaps looking at them that waist
is absolutely tiny but let's see if I
can fit them on and hopefully they're
not gonna be too short because I don't
think we have many bear leg days left
for the rest of this year's I really
really like these shorts can you see
Dexter in the mirror looking of me bless
him
so yeah love these shorts I really like
the way that these are finished at the
top this kind of paper bag style I think
there is quite a lot of detail with the
bow I mean it just means that there's a
lot of fabric around here but I don't
mind it love the color I definitely
think they're very versatile color wise
I might wear these with a white vest top
plugged into it tuck it in tuck it in
but yeah I can imagine getting a lot of
use out of these they have got little
pockets as well in the side here and I
also think they look a lot more
expensive than they were so another
success from misguided then I picked up
a bikini and this is not terribly me
it's a little bit too like cool
Instagram girl for my personal style but
nonetheless I was dying to try it and
just see how it looked on me it's one of
these I think they're called harness
style so you've got these straps and
this is kind of a t-section strap
they're a thicker strap around the chest
what's it called around the ribcage and
then at the bottoms and they're in this
beautiful blush pink color have got
these straps as well so it's gonna be a
very strappy bikini a little bit as your
provocateur ish but without all the
multiple colors I really don't know how
this is gonna look and to be honest my
body is not its best at the moment I
have started to indulge in some winter
food so I may try it on I may not if
I've decided not to try it on I'm
certified to it on the model here so
that you can see how it looks like how
it's meant to look but yeah I will give
this a try because I do want to be able
to take those gorgeous instagram-worthy
photos wearing this style of bikini I'm
just not sure if I'm gonna be able to
pull it off so I got it in this blush
color and also a white shape which I
will show you when I pull it out the bag
next up is a grey duster coat and I
think this is from the Carli bybel range
not sure um it doesn't actually say on
the label but it is a gray very light
material long duster coat you've got
these big slits I'd say they're probably
from around the waist downwards one
thing I would say is this is already
really creased and I don't know about
you but I can never be bothered to iron
out of it I think things like coats just
shouldn't need to behind and also for
this time of year this is really really
thin so this is gonna have to look
pretty darn amazing for me to keep this
otherwise it's gonna be one of those
pieces that just goes up entire wardrobe
until next summer or spring and who
knows if I'm gonna like this style by
then but let's give it a try and have a
look anyway the creased fabric on this
really does bug me I have to say I think
that I can't keep it just because it's
so creased and I know that I would just
if it gets this creased from being in a
carrier bag for 24 hours then I can't
even imagine how close it's gonna get
when I wear it just such a shame so I do
like the style I just seems that other
retailers like River Island they tend to
do them a little bit higher quality and
you know that I have a couple from
Mariah and Topshop that I wear quite a
lot I love this length fine it's super
flattering I do like the color as well
but the quality of the material is just
not doing it for me so this is another
very gray and very creased piece this is
the cardi by the one I think I thought
the other one was the Carli bybel but
they're both very similar this one
as a slightly thicker material for a
waist belt which makes them a bit more
flattering and it's got pockets in as
well but other than that it's really not
that different it wouldn't surprise me
if it was the same pattern that they
used to create the two coats so you've
got this lovely lapel and then strap
details on the sleeves but again really
creased which just leads me to believe
that when I wear it for the day if I sit
down or if I roll my sleeves up it's
gonna get really creased
but once again let's give it a try it
and have a little look this is the Carli
bybel one and it is just as bad as the
previous one in fact I think this looks
so scruffy I don't know what it is I
think it's just that it's so creased and
these wrist straps I haven't even going
on properly but oh I don't know I just
feel like they've shoved a load of
additional design details on the
original gray coat and also it's longer
so I'm not wearing any heels but I
definitely wouldn't want this to be a
good texture I definitely wouldn't want
this to be on the floor the pockets are
a little bit saggy not gonna lie I'm
pretty disappointed with the quality in
these coats then we have another pair of
jeans and these aren't too dissimilar to
the ones before there are similar kind
of mid blue wash but these ones do not
have any rips they look a little bit
less slim fitting although they do stay
nice and narrow all the way down to the
ends I'm always buying high waisted
jeans personally for me they are just
the best fit and most flattering and to
be honest with these ones because
they're not too expensive if I might
actually rip the bottoms off or cut the
bottoms cuz I really like that raw edged
finish and I think that if you're gonna
wear some statement shoes if you've got
some lovely loafers then that looks
really really cool so if I decide to do
that I will may not do a video on like
customizing their jeans or something I
don't know but if these are really
lovely fit then I'll be very tempted to
snip the bottom off so let's give them a
try and so these I'd say are pretty much
your standard pair of jeans I don't
really have any design detail they're
just plain kind of Navy washed denim I
just don't know if I need a plain pair
of jeans you know I think the I think
the ripped ones are a little bit more
flattering I feel like my legs look
quite squashed down in these that they
look quite wide and I don't know maybe
it's me being funny but to be honest I
just don't think there's anything too
special about
having said that the fit is really nice
they don't really have anything wrong
they're really comfortable good fit so
yeah I mean if you're in the market for
a new pair of jeans it's just a plain
pair these are fine but personally I
just find them a little bit dull so I
have a feeling that I've actually picked
up the same pair of jeans in two
different sizes so I'm going to try on
these size four and size six and I'll
let you know which size fits me better
I'd say in Topshop I normally wear size
6
but when this guided I'm not too sure on
the sizing so I will let you know which
size fits me better these ones are even
more high-waisted once again you've got
the rips I kind of like how small these
rips are they're really not too
in-your-face once again I'm gonna be
tempted to cut the bottoms off these
knots aren't about anything although you
could do a what's called dipped hem and
uneven hem you know when it's slightly
longer at the back I might give that a
little experiment with these ones but I
actually think this start of jeans looks
a lot more expensive than they are these
can so easily be Victoria Beckham or 7
for mankind because they just the wash
is really really lovely I'm sure they
won't be the most long-lasting jeans but
I think from first impressions they look
really good so let's give them a try and
see if I'm right I think of all the
ripped jeans that I've got from
misguided these ones are the most
flattering they've got quite small rips
so you can see they've got rips all over
but they don't open up too wide I think
if the rip is on the knee you can see my
knee bonus here and then it tends to
open up a little bit whereas these are
more strategically placed let's say they
are a little bit long you can see a
little bit of crinkling down on my
ankles so I think I will give these a
snip just to make them the right length
for me and leave it nice and raw but
yeah I'm impressed with the fit on these
they've got a little bit of fading and a
bit of a rip on the bum and once again
really comfy nice and elastic despite
the fact these are a size four so if I
keep any of the jeans which I will do I
think I'm definitely gonna keep these
ones hello Suzie G yeah yelping let me
try on today on you this is another dust
and this one is not gray it's a
beautiful blush peachy pink color which
is very me as I'm sure you guys know
this one has got little pockets which
are more kind of hidden pockets also got
the detail and sleeves although no metal
this is just a bow of fabric it does
still have a subtle lapel and this kind
of crappy material doesn't crease
anywhere near as badly as the more
polyester II material of grey ones so a
lot more easy care and hopefully will
look better for longer it actually says
the color of this is camel but I would
definitely say it's got more pink in it
so hopefully this will suit me a little
bit better than the grey okay I take
back what I said about this not be
increased because as you can see it is
hugely creased it definitely needs a
good steaming I really like the color
but you guys might remember I have a
river island coat which is a nice
material this is that kind of and then
if you can see very clearly but it's a
it's a kind of like textured material
which I'm not too sure if I like I do
like the back detail it's got a really
big slit down the back so you can
properly like open it up oh I don't know
I do love the color I like the style I
don't like how badly it creases but then
it is quite a nice layering piece and I
think if I could be bothered to steam it
then it is something that I'd wear quite
a lot so let me know what you guys think
because I'm torn so I showed you the
pink bikini earlier and this is the
white version once again I'll insert a
photo here of the model of wearing it
because she definitely pulls it off much
better than I would ever be able to but
yeah once again this will look amazing
if you've got a proper turn if you're
going away for any late summer Sun
holidays and you've already got a bit of
a tan this is gonna look absolutely
stunning I think this style just is so
photogenic and I'm dying to make these
work for me so let me give it a try and
I'll let you guys know and the final
thing I picked up in my misguided haul
is this blue Bardot top now this I'm
actually really disappointed in so the
style of it is really lovely I love this
off the shoulder I love that you've got
the elastication around elastication
the elastic around the
and around the neckline and I love these
spaghetti straps but this material is
absolutely not nice at all what it feels
like
it smells like plastic it feels it was
like a white clean medical material I'm
gonna have to have a look what fabric
this is because I have never felt
anything like this okay that's really
weird it just says someone's like cotton
but I definitely know what cotton feels
like and this is weird I feel like it's
probably had like a waxy coating panel
over it or something but either way it's
very creased and it smells funny and it
looks and feels really weird I'll give
it a try but I've not terribly got high
hopes about this one I actually like
this top a whole lot more now that I've
tried it on I think that once it's
ironed it won't look too bad obviously
I'm wearing a black bra so the bra
straps don't go terribly well with it
but these spaghetti straps are really
long so they're elastic but if I was to
pull them tight the top would be like
boob level which personally I would
rather it's up here so if I did keep
this I'm gonna have to cut these maybe
like an inch shorter like you've got
this much fabric this much of the strap
to spatter but having said that I do
really like how this looks you can't
really tell the nav material from that
far away
and yeah it's just really in fashion as
some of these whole Bardot tops and I
don't think the trend is going away
anywhere so once again for end of summer
holidays this is a really really lovely
one so guys that is everything that I
picked it up in my misguided haul this
