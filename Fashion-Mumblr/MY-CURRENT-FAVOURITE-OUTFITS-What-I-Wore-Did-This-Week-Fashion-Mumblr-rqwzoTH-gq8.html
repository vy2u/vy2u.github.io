yeah
hey guys and welcome to a new weekly
vlog outfit Diaries video today's video
is coming at you starting off
unconventionally on a Wednesday evening
so the start of this week has just been
a little bit manic as has the rest of
the day I did film a few Clips earlier
in the day so I think you might have
seen a little bit of my morning workout
it was just me so Adam totally blitzed
my glutes and quads I'm definitely gonna
be feeling that tomorrow and then I
headed headed is that reward then I head
to the Corinthian Hotel where system
professional were launching a new
haircare range which is a really
fabulous range thirteen new products all
designed with really conditioning the
hair in mind as a BB range CC range and
a DD range we have until March to wait
for those to come out but I've already
tried out the dry shampoo and one of the
beauty bombs so looking forward to
really road testing those I will keep
you updated as to how I get along with
them then it was just a day full of
meetings followed by a session with
Topshop where we discovered their denim
at launches for the new year and also
their men's launch as well which is
really good fun I am now all dressed up
as you may be able to tell heading to
the Park Plaza Hotel because it is the
Johnson and Johnson Beauty Awards
tonight and I am somehow nominated for
two awards which is incredible I do not
know how that happened I believe the
official names of the awards are best
use of social media and best beauty
youtuber which is incredible chances of
me winning I would say are very very
slim Johnson Johnson awards are probably
the most prestigious UK blog Awards and
they're definitely the awards taken the
most seriously by the beauty industry so
to even be nominated I'm quite
flabbergasted but yeah so I'm excited to
take you along to that I just ordered a
new bow it's two minutes away so I'm
going to give you a very quick outfit of
the evening okie dokie so this is the
dress that I'm wearing this evening it's
a beautiful kind of leafy floral detail
dress from chichi London I love this
detail around the waist been waiting for
so long to wear this dress I've had it
on my rail for about three weeks now
just absolutely love it and then my
shoes wearing my little Valentino's
unsurprisingly my gold ones and then I
have got my Cloe handbag which is pretty
much my go-to for events I just had to
very quickly wash my hair because I've
been out all day and haven't had a
chance to wash it after the gym so it's
a little bit fluffy at the moment but I
just quickly whizzed over it with the
steam pod so it's not looking too bad
and then I've accessorized with a few
bracelets you can see on each wrist from
the new Monica Vanetta Fuji collection
and I also have these beautiful hoop
earrings and we've better if I showed
you this way these hoop earrings which I
absolutely love
these are also from the Monica Vernon to
Fiji collection and I think they are
probably my favorite pieces like this I
use every single day and it's amazing
New Jersey's you know I use the lovino
spray moisturizer that consumers go for
here since so many different things and
then there's the Neutrogena for the LED
lights fixed mass which have not tried
yet I'm anticipating if you've been
watching my youtube channel for a long
time you'll know that I was a his when
Sun ambassador a couple years ago blast
from the past still defeats products for
socially you start learning warts - mala
lanna children
the winner is to create consistent and
signature style but it lets over content
to a very high standard I receive strong
engagement from her mother's stylish
sophisticated and he completely fish
that were caught in her context an
execution totally of the years are
streamed high and I love each Eve each
is very sensitive about so not so
just arrived back home reunited with my
sweet little boys and I have no words
for what has happened this evening Oh
Dixie just tried to jump up on the sofa
and epically failed I was nominated for
Best beauty youtuber that was won by
Fleur de force well done Fleur and also
a new baby also social media star 2018
and the other nominees were Fleur and M
Sheldon and I uh and I am pleased to
reveal and I am now the proud owner of
the johnson and johnson award for best
social media star 2018 which is insane
can't quite believe that that has
happened
Sophie Hannah Richardson was presenting
the award and well I recorded it so
hopefully you will have just seen it but
she said that the judges were impressed
with the quality and consistency and
regularity of my content and they really
liked how I seamlessly integrated
sponsored content in with organic
content which I think as a content
creator is the ultimate compliment and
pat on the back I guess is always that
fine balance obviously working with
brands is my job but I wanted to fit in
seamlessly with my content so for that
to be recognized I was very very
grateful for overall just an amazing
evening so many incredible and inspiring
women both presenting the awards judging
the awards all the nominees all the
winners it's such a lovely evening and
so much positivity so I feel very very
grateful to have been involved and thank
you so
so much to Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson for my
award I'm going to put it up on the
shelves next to my 2016 best emerging
beauty youtuber award what do you think
Dickey here is my 2016 best emerging
blogger and now in pride of place I can
tell I'm going to be really OCD at
cleaning this 2018 social media I've
just had a little peek inside the goodie
bag from the awards ceremony of course
lots of lovely J&amp;amp;J goodies so I'm gonna
have a double cleanse with two of the
products from the good guys starting off
with the face care makeup begone whites
from Johnson Johnson that these are the
pampering ones which if any have tried
before and then because I don't like
using only face wipes definitely not far
enough after a lot of makeup on a day in
the city I'm going to use the Neutrogena
visibly clear pink grapefruit daily
scrub helps eliminate and prevent spots
and blackheads work eat fresh feel good
I did pretty much the same makeup this
evening as I did in my Valentines Day
get ready with me video so you haven't
seen a Monday's video no Sunday's video
and then check that out if you want to
see how I got this look because it's
basically my go-to evening / slightly
more effort than daytime makeup look
I like that this is firming up as well
as having little beans and then I feel
like I'm getting a real deep cleanse as
well as an exfoliation what you need off
for a long day I just run downstairs to
take my patter
off the hole because that had been
cooking for far too long but I just
finished off my evening skincare with my
lizard super skin oil which I love when
I feel I must give me a little bit of
pampering that was my speedy evening
routine I spent too much time talking
tonight and not enough time eating the
canapes are normally I love canapes I've
got it but I was too busy chatting Ryan
have some pasta go to bed and then
tomorrow is a really fun day so I will
see you in the morning good morning it
is Thursday and I've started off the day
at my favourite London hotel in the
Savoy I've just left forgot to take my
vlogging camera in with me
but they're really really lovely start
to the morning Ted Baker have a
beautiful wedding collection they have
wedding dresses they have bridesmaid
dresses
of course wedding shoes Bard's made
shoes which are personalizable with your
date or initials and to meet them and so
many stunning wedding dresses they start
at 399 and the quality of them the
materials they're using the pleating
it's just absolute gorgeous so I went to
their event which was in one of the
Suites at the Savoy and also got my
nails done by a tribe I said looking at
beautiful nice bride or themed manicure
and insert a couple of clips here that I
found on my phone while I was inside as
you can see some of the beautiful
dresses now heading to the Tate Britain
I'm gonna catch up with the girls there
and we're grabbing a minibus to the
Cotswolds going on a lovely trip with it
cosmetics but I'm really looking forward
to a nice excuse to escape this indeed
and just have some fresh air there girly
time usual things so we've just arrived
at Fox Hill Manor which is in the
Cotswolds with the girls from it
cosmetics but in the whole
two-and-a-half hour bus journey just
chatting away with Freddie we had a good
catch up we're both wearing the same
Jean for today which is very tragic
I just nip it into the toilet to sort my
face out you give me very good outfit
today this is my travel outfit I was
wearing little jumper from Topshop Ted
Baker crossbody bag and then these on my
kids for trial trousers and my little
Rhys use both of which sadly sold out I
think this jump Western stock Freddie
and I naturally and honestly didn't
bring this coming back because I knew
Freddie Charles - no
here so we now have a SAS class we're
hoping that's not hair talk so we
finished our SAS class and oh my
goodness it was so much fun we did a
whole routine to Beyonce run the world
and oh my goodness loo all releasing our
inner hip hop dancer and it was so much
fun and we've now been shown to our
rooms we are splits a quite big group
was split between Fox Hill Manor which
is where we did the class and dormi
house which is all part of the same
company but dormie house is five minute
drive down the road and I've just been
shown to I save room but it's actually a
whole cottage feeling very very spoiled
and it's called Rose Cottage which is so
lovely so I'll give you a little tour
I should have filmed my first tour
around here because I was squealing
every single room that I went into and
there's so many treats so we've got
we've got something here 4:00 in the
morning so everything is based on the
times that we're here this one is for
tomorrow morning there's some lipsticks
to try out we've got some coffee machine
bits and bobs over here a beautiful
little it cosmetics makeup case perfect
big mirror here's do my makeup in the
morning and of course I'll be using my
it cosmetics CC cream which you guys
have no I absolutely love we've got
there bye-bye under-eye there eyebrow
pencil there bye-bye pause powder all of
my favorite products I will definitely
be having a soak in the tub later oh
look at there's got the it cosmetics
cleanser moisturizer and under-eye cream
and then for this evening this is my
bedroom how adorable is this and I have
some personalized pajamas how cute is
that says Josie embroidered on there
that is so adorable so the whole trip is
all based around having confidence in
yourself and encouraging confidence with
other girls and health products whether
you have makeup on or you don't have any
makeup on it's all about just feeling
totally confident in your skin and I
think because the products were
developed to the plastic surgeon with
in care in mind it really does help to
make you feel confident with or without
makeup so it's a really really lovely
brand to be here with and I'm feeling
very very spoilt already so thank you
very cosmetic
I am now gonna hop into my swimming
costume because I think Freddie and I
are going to check out the outdoor hot
tub
so after an ugly host of experience
around his puffiness pampering showers
dinner and now all the girls in less
than in my room sweeties it's time for
me night good morning it is Friday last
night was really good fun we had a girly
sleepover with all the other bloggers
that are at the event and we all have
these personalized Josie white company
pajamas such a fun evening I've just
cleanse my skin and I thought I would do
a very quick very natural get ready with
me of course I'm using it cosmetics this
is confidence in a cream it's their
best-selling moisturizer anti-aging for
me this is a really good moisturizer
when my skin my skin isn't bad and but I
just want something really comfortable
and it's going to make my skin feel
amazing and look amazing it cosmetics
was developed with plastic surgeons so
all the products have skincare in them
nothing in there is going to aggravate
the skin it's all about nourishing and
making you feel your best
well I love about this moisturizer that
you feel that you're getting all the
nourishment from a really thick juicy
moisturizer but then it sinks in so
quickly because your skin just absorbs
all the goodness and you're ready to do
your makeup in just a few minutes and
then again anti-aging and be confidence
in an eye cream this is great for
brightening and repairing the under eye
area so any problems that you might have
with the under eye I use about that much
and because it's quite a thick cream you
want to keep it quite far from the
actual eye so really just on the bone
the iPhone tap it in if I sound a bit
groggy it's because I haven't had my
coffee yet this morning I'll sleep so
I'm gonna go and make my coffee give
this two minutes to sink in and then I
will show you my very natural everyday
Capri team ok I'm back and feeling a
little bit more alive now I've had some
coffee so the first thing I'm going to
apply on to my cleanse and moisturize
skin is the egg cosmetics CC cream you
don't actually need to use a moisturizer
with this as well unless you really want
to or if like me you are in a hot tub
yesterday and your skin feels ultra dry
but you don't need anything you can miss
out your primer you can miss out your
moisturizer because this is a serum a
primer a moisturizer and SPF and a
foundation all-in-one I would say the
coverage is medium and it took me quite
a long time to try this because I think
when it first came out I was very much
of me wanting full coverage and I
thought that a CC cream wouldn't be
enough for me but as you're about to see
my skin's a little bit red in the
mornings it is very good coverage I'm
going to use a Beauty Blender so this is
a color corrector as well so any redness
or if you've got any purple or blue
tones under the eyes or just corrects
all of that you can see instantly my
redness is neutralized they're bringing
out some new shades of this you can see
for a CC cream which is skin care and
foundation and one that this coverage is
amazing and still really nice and gooey
color correcting full coverage cream
plus anti-aging hydrating serum SPF 50
UVA UVB your skin but better today I
don't really have that bad at eyebags
which is amazing for me most people the
it cosmetics eye cream but I'm still
going to use a little bit of bye-bye
under-eye this is a very very full
coverage concealer under the eyes I have
a shade lights you can see there I use
about 1/3 of a grain of rice because I
don't want too much product under the
eye but this does not crease that's why
this is so loved amongst makeup lovers
and beauty bloggers because it just will
not crease under the eyes which is
always a bit of a telltale
Simon doesn't makes your face look worse
if you have your under eye wrinkles
accentuated by your concealer so I don't
want my skin to get shiny and I do on my
makeup to slide off but at the same time
I don't want to be totally mattified so
I'm going to use the bye-bye pores
pressed powder this is a translucent
powder doesn't even feel that like a
powder really really lightweight and I'm
just going to pop that all over to set
my makeup and then I'm going to bronze I
like to just do the complexion first and
then move on to things like brows and
eyes and lips so I'm going to use my
bare minerals invisible bronze this one
is a really natural color good for
everyday it's not like a super dark
bronze it just brings a little bit of
warmth to the complexion and bare
minerals I'd say is another one that you
can be assured that the makeup isn't
doing anything bad for your skin it's
all mineral based so now that I've got
some color in my complexion I'm going to
use the it cosmetics brow power this has
got a spoolie on one end and a brow
crayon in the other and it's a universal
taupe shade so no matter what shade your
eyebrows are this color is for you don't
ask me how it works because every other
brow pencil there are like a thousand
shades this is one of them if you can
see that very clearly but it's like a
topi gray shade and it just works on
everyone setting them with my glossy a
boy brow then I'm going to take a shade
from the by Terry game-changer palette
this has got lots of really nice brown
e-news and I'm going to go for this kind
of mushroom shade today for everyday
makeup I just tend to take one eyeshadow
shade and just wipe it all over the lid
for a little bit of definition and then
I would usually use roller lash in Brown
I bought the black one with me stupidly
but I'm gonna try the it cosmetics
superhero mascara I've heard really good
things about this and I'm here with
cosmetics don't be rude not to really
nice bristly brush as you can see it's a
little bit shaped so I should be able to
get in to the edges I mean already that
is amazing I've literally done four
strokes of mascara and look at the
difference oh my god okay I can
definitely see what all the fuss is
about this mascara is amazing it's
really like opened up my eyes it's a lot
of length no clumpy nuts
the next step is when I brush my teeth
this is my handy travel sized toothbrush
I think the brand is called sonic chic
but they're just so handy and they're
electric toothbrushes which is great and
then I have Marvis toothpaste in case
you're wondering and the reason why I do
this next is because I need to get rid
of the foundation lips and then dominate
balm
then the last thing I do for a very
natural everyday makeup look is my lips
and what I tend to do for my everyday
makeup is use a tinted lip balm I've got
three favorites the one that I've had as
my favorite for the longest is d :
petite open mwah lip balm like this and
this is just a really lovely soft pink
shade so that one usually lives in my
handbag or I pop it on first in the
morning a new addition it's my
collection is the Dior Addict lip glow
in the shade
double-o for coral the packaging on this
one I absolutely love it's in this pink
bullet and then this is more of a coral
color I would say it's quite a summery
color but I got a tan I absolutely love
it but today I think I'm going to use my
by Terry new decimo this is in the shade
number one got this a little while ago
after lusting for it for so long again
really beautiful packaging this one that
lives again in my handbag and it's a
little bit more intense color but
actually what I'm going to do today
because I am seeing people I'm not just
staying in the house is using a lip
liner this is a really lovely very
wearable pinky Brown from the Clarins
lip pencil really like this one and it
just adds a bit more definition if all
your going to use it's a tinted lip balm
I just love this so much it reminds me
of old school like revision techniques
you've also got a brown eyeliner pencil
in there and then you just twist them to
bring them out you've got a black
eyeliner and then a blue eyeliner as
well I've not used the blue one but I
just love the shade of the lip liner the
most and it's obviously so handy having
all four in one and I personally lose
eyeliners and lip liners so much so to
have them all in one pan makes me far
less like you to lose them so now my
lips are lined and I'm going to add
moisture and color with my by terry
naturally smells oh it's good nudism Oh
that's it that's my everyday very
natural easy makeup I could do this in
five minutes or probably less than that
and but I've been chatting this morning
and it took me a while to warm up after
my coffee I think if you compare me now
- when I started 15 minutes ago I am now
alive so I'm going to get dressed meet
up with girls and we have a confidence
master class this morning that's usually
so we're at the main manor house and it
is time for Thank You Pat the time for
breakfast
let me show you this spectacular
I see all the tables turn that's where I
was
that this life
it gives fine
and I know that you cannot do before
okay
give me
it is Sunday and I'm having a very day
shitty we're out for a very chilly
morning walk in Windsor Great Park with
all the fan behind and our two little
chair Rubin Dickie has had to have been
carried for most of this walk even
Kangas I think he's a little chilly
isn't he yeah I knew just gets tired
easy just me you get tired if your leg
for this is not quite as fair as - no
look at these lovely pink ounces right
it's where the green love used to live
in that don't if you're not film
actually probably not probably not
listen quite angry policemen that live
in those yeah they've all got like the
security detail but yes we're just offer
a nice walk before we're gonna have a
big roast and we get back outfit of the
day is a bit mix and match I've got my
new River Island jumper but the dirt
it's nice cozy roll neck and then I've
got my sweaty Betty leggings trainers
and my cozy briefs camel coat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
