my current skincare routine I'm going to
share with you the products I'm using
most mornings and evenings I'm going to
get started with the first thing I use
after I get out of bed and it is a
mouthful of water
at the moment I'm really liking this
Garnier one a nice little water in
general is great because it really just
acts like a magnet and it pulls away any
dirt and impurities from your skin and
because you just soak a cotton pad it is
so easy next of course is the iconic and
there's our cleanse and polish I
absolutely love this I know so many of
you guys do too
I just find the formula so perfect for
my skin it's very softening very
moisturizing
it's got naturally active botanical
ingredients as well you've got rosemary
camel such etc so as you do I'm just
using my cloth wetting it with nice warm
water and then polishing away my skin so
it's a really lovely gentle exfoliation
and use my skin smooth radiant and yeah
huge fan of that you guys know how much
I love the dolphin lumia essential this
is an illuminating oil serum so it's got
little micro encapsulated pearls of oils
within the serum I find it incredibly
hydrating it smells great and I love the
way this leaves my skin it's very
hydrating as is my night cream which is
also dar fans the Hydra skin all day I
refreshed gel cream this is very
hydrating very very lightweight I find
it good at the puffing getting rid of
any dark circles and just a very
refreshing sensation on my eye area I
don't need this every day but I love the
Elemis Pro collagen marine cream with
SPF 30 it's one of these products that's
proven it to reduce the appearance of
fine lines and wrinkles in 14 days I
don't use it for that reason but I just
love how my skin looks and feels after I
use this today I'm actually going to be
using the by Kerry Hydra class daily
care this is a gel formula it is so
moisturizing I find it really energizing
and my skin just feels so quenched
afterwards it also has anti pollution
particles in there
if it smells incredible there are so
many types of roses in here and I just
find my skin feels smooth and soft and
really radiant after I apply this so
that's the final step of my actual skin
care but because I didn't put any SPF on
I'm going to be using the Paula's Choice
resist smoothing primer this is a three
and one there's a primer serum and SPF
it's factious 30 I just really like to
have a few for my skin it's very smooth
that loves the imperfections and it's a
really great base to make up so that's
the final thing I do before applying my
makeup after the makeup is done I'm
using the Kiehl's cactus flower
hydrating mist just love it at this time
of year as a real instant hydration
boost
so now we're moving on to my evening
skincare routine as you can see I'm
using this little headband I got this at
a recent Reserve and great for keeping
the products out of my hair once again
going in with a mindful of water I get
through a lot of my fellow waters this
Garnier one is a small travel sized one
as you can tell this is not my bathroom
at home so it was great to pack a little
mini I'm going to be using the off key
renaissance tenzin gel i find that this
is one that i keep going back to no
matter what problem I have with my skin
I find that it's very illuminating it's
really good at soothing the skin if I've
got any kind of problem this tends to
help it's got vitamin C and E in there
it's really good at just restoring the
skin and helping the skin to protect
itself just love this so much so I use a
little bit of water to turn it into a
milky consistency before using a cloth
to buff it away so I do get a little bit
of exfoliation as well so what I do next
actually varies a little bit the two
products I'm going to talk about next
are ones I switch in and out of my
routine
there's the Lancome Visionnaire
crescendo overnight progressive night
peel this little two-phase system that
really helps to refine the complexion
really love this and I'm also using the
me after metamorphosis oil a real treat
for the skin I do
spider on a blog recently so leave that
links down below tonight though I'm
going to be using the Estee Lauder
advanced night repair icon flex this
I've been using for well over a year it
really helps to reduce any kind of aging
around the eyes I find it really
soothing great for any dryness
performance etc and then from the same
range I'm using the Estee Lauder
advanced night repair mask in oil
sometimes I use this after the a ml
serum and sometimes I use on its own I
find it really just gives my skin and
lovely radiance and I love applying oils
so this is a brilliant addition to the
advanced night repair system finally
sometimes I like to tan before I go to
sleep sometimes I just use a moisturizer
but tonight I'm using the Charlotte
Tilbury overnight bronze &amp;amp; Glow mask I
love the natural towns I wake up with
when I use this
so this is quickly becoming a skincare
favorite of mine so that's everything I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I'll see you in the next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
