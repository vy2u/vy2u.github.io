having a fabulous day and enjoying this
beautiful sunshine we're having at the
moment it finally feels like spring is
properly here so I'm in my absolute
element today I'm going to be sharing
with you my designer handbag collection
and this has probably been my most
requested video recently of the past few
months so I decided to finally sit down
film it and I'm going to be sharing with
you every single designer bag in my
collection by saying that it sounds like
my collections really big it's actually
moderate sized and and this is every
single designer that I've ever owned
because I have actually never sold a
designer handbag when I make a purchase
but is this large I think so long and
hard about it and I absolutely have no
regrets of any of these numbers each and
every single one of these handbags took
me a long time to really think whether I
truly wanted it and when I get loved
used out of it so each one has been a
really great investment for me there
having said that this is my desire by
collection that has taken me about 10
years to build up so it's definitely not
something that I've built up in an
instant I don't buy buy a bags at the
drop of a hat I really do consider my
purchases very carefully and I like to
invest in classic hamburger or Romanian
style for many many years to come so I
still of course do have my very first
designer bags because they're such
classic shapes and styles as you will
see a lot of these bags will now
suddenly be out of stock but where
possible I will leave the bags link down
below or at least I'll leave the 2017
edition of that bag where they might
have been painted another note but I
feel comes with these a designer bag
videos is that I totally get that
designer handbag videos are not
everyone's cup of tea personally I
cannot afford a water into the designer
things and sometimes it makes me a
little bit upset watch in designing
youtube videos so if you don't like a
designer videos then maybe switch this
one off because it's all about designer
bags hence the title it's affordable
fashion is more your bank then do not
worry because I have tons of affordable
fashion videos on my channel and a
desireable recently which oh my god
has had like 120,000 views that is crazy
my little old channel and so yeah lots
of fordable fashion videos as well check
those all out
I leave my spring edit down below
because there's loads of great videos
there so please do subscribe if you love
fashion videos I do lots of them's Look
Books styling edits trend videos cause
that kind of thing so yeah do give that
little subscribe button a click if you
love fashion videos Beauty trouble etc
and before I ramble any more let's just
get started with my designer handbag
collection alright so I'm going to kick
things off with my oldest bag and
because I feel like if I start from
oldest to newest then you will probably
see those you've not seen before on my
channel so the very first handbag that
was ever invited into my collection is
the mulberry Bayswater those meet
mulberry has always been a very special
brand
it was branded I spies from work for
when I was younger I always wanted the
mulberry bag it was really a brand grow
close to my heart in fact my first job
in the fashion industry was working at
mulberry but I actually got this bag
before I worked that this was actually a
very generous present for an
ex-boyfriend he bought it to me when we
went to Paris together when I think I
was about 18 years old I believe at the
time this cost around seven hundred
pounds there are a lot more expensive
now I can get at least three or five
hundred pounds more expensive in fact
I'm not even sure they make the classic
space otter anymore but this one I
absolutely adore it seems beautiful
light brown always caramel spongy
leather with a rose gold person unlock
this is the classic mulberry postman
lock it's a little bit scratched and I
did actually have to take this to the
mulberry store to get it repaired a few
times because I did wear it every single
day filled it to the brim and it
certainly got a lot of use I have to get
the never replace down here I have to
get the lock replaced and I has get the
handles replaced because they really did
wear out and get terribly scratched
luckily I don't know if it's the same
anymore but luckily and when I took this
back to the mulberry store in Covent
Garden despite the fact I bought it in
Paris they were really good at sending
it to their work or Factory and some of
that to get a lot of the pieces replaced
and repaired so yeah I fair use this is
my
in a handbag for probably two or three
years I've used this as my uni handbag I
carry my laptop in yearbooks every
single thing you can possibly imagine so
this certainly got a lot of use and as
it's my first designer bag it'll always
have a very special place in my heart
and my wardrobe my next design bag is
also from mulberry you'll notice a bit
of a running theme the first few
designer bags this is the lily bag and
it is a very pale patent leather I'll
insert the closer because you can't
really see here but this is actually
quite badly marked so here and here
there are some darker patches and it
sustains the patent leather because
actually when I was traveling back from
a holiday one I took this bag with me
and I put it in my suitcase underneath a
magazine and because of the heat the ink
from the magazine sadly stained in the
bag and I took it lots of handbag repair
places but sadly nowhere could fix it
which is really gutting the bag itself
is still absolutely stunning it's called
this gorgeous rose gold pink chain strap
you've got this little toggle here which
actually usually has a little horseshoe
and if I think that inside the bag once
again at the classic mulberry rose gold
postman lock and then inside you've got
a suede material and and the tampon okay
we'll just put that back in to turn up
in heaven for me this was a really great
starting collection I have the base
water everyday and then this was my
evening bag and my special occasion bag
once again for over two years got so so
so much use out of it okay so the fear
of being very repetitive my shirt /
purchase you guessed it was also from
mulberry once again I was really trying
to make sure that every bag need was
covered and I wasn't buying loads of
everyday bags or loose of evening bags
so my next best purchase was this one
which is the Clipper
hold all in a fluorescent pink I got
this from Selfridges at the end of my
first year of uni and yours in a sale I
think I paid around 450 pounds with the
leather on this handbag is that petal
leather which is incredibly hard wearing
so despite the fact that I've used this
probably at least three times a month if
not more or four weekends away or trips
back to Mom's house it still is in great
condition obviously it's a little bit
bastard and just from my being put on
the floor you know at the hold also
naturally it gets chucked around again
puts in overhead compartments it gets
kicked under the seat but the leather
itself looks absolutely beautiful stills
it's got this heart label which in women
inside it's got them all resigning
really big and spacious and this is
probably one of the most used things in
my entire wardrobe button you can also
get this style probably got this exact
one in Vista Village but I always go
down in the sale so definitely keep a
lookout for more free clipper bags
number four and I promise you this is
the last more regarding my collection
this is the sesame bag and yes it's
black it's probably the only ball one
dress flashing that I own in my entire
wardrobe but I really wanted a classic
big bag this one I actually did buy when
I worked for over eight so I've got my
50% staff this canvas which is very
generous with them excuse stuff discount
out big but also it still cost me 750
pounds so still a very expensive bag buy
this one has the updated postman lock so
it still works in the same way and as a
base water in the lily so it has the
lock it goes into the flour and then you
twist it but because it was spring
summer 12 they updated it with this
floral design 9 year it's got the
scalloped edges which once again is back
in fashion this spring files definitely
bringing this one out again the only
problem I have with this bag is the
strap because it's a huge bags or always
so chance to spin it with heavy things
like nut top books makeup bags etc but
the change is a little bit uncomfortable
to where you really do have to make sure
you've got plenty of padding or on
fabric on your shoulder to protect your
skin so yeah this I think timing wise
this probably has been my third year of
uni but really I bought this at the end
of the time that I worked at mulberry a
bit of a treat to myself for a working
man and every single bag in my
collection from the very first up the
most recent always has a memory attached
to it
I always tend to buy bags and the way
almost like congratulating myself if I
worked really hard on something or
almost to mark the end of an era so
I'll try and tell you the memory behind
each baggage that goes on but the
disorder will always remind me of my
time working at Mulberry working really
hard as an unpaid intern for about a
year before finally getting a job there
but yet always remind me of that first
job in the fashion industry so now a
little bit of a transition because at
this stage in my life I started blogging
so if the next purchases all of the next
Lotus purchases were all inspired by
bloggers I think that definitely says
something about how manuals shot the
bags we often discover designer bags
through bloggers and through Instagram
and my next designer bags purchase was
the Rebecca Minkoff Marvel tote bag so
this one was inspired by American
blogger called Jesse from the darling
detail and this was at the time when
Marvel was at its absolute peak every
single blogger was obsessed with marble
we all had to have a marble handbag and
this one was so dinky crossbody so
perfect for those outfit photos very
Instagram abilify bought this one from
America and I featured it in probably
every single blog post for the entire of
summer 2014 I think it was so Marvel is
obviously not quite as obsessed over
right now but we still absolutely love
it so I will be getting a lot more use
out of this bag in summer and now the
rest of this video you guys are going to
have to play spot the difference because
I actually originally filmed this video
a few days ago and then when I went to
edit it today I realized that I
accidentally deleted the intro so this
bit they've just seen has all been
refilmed and that you're about to see I
filmed a few days ago so let's play spot
the difference I tried to do my hair and
I made from my outfit the same and there
may be a few differences so we're now
going to skip back in time and you're
going to see the rest of the video which
I've filmed a few days ago let's go of
course with its size you can barely fit
that much inside it I think I need to
just keep mine as a pen and my mobile my
person maybe some lipstick that's about
it but it really did just go down boom
on Instagram I bought this from Rebecca
Minkoff website online after I spotted
it on an American blogger call to the
darling detail who I still love and
follow so thank you Jesse you inspired
my first blogger designer handbag
purchase so this is where I might start
to slightly news check of the right
order but these have all been bought in
the
last year now so getting to my recent
purchases you may remember seeing me
wearing this a lot this time last year
it's very much a spring flannel bag I'm
really looking forward to wearing this
one again I absolutely adore this it is
a Valentino rocks turd and you've got
this beautiful coral/orange gorgeous
like spring summery shade chevron prints
on it I love that it's a little bit
unusual I was really torn between
getting this and the blush colored one
but I just love how unusual and striking
this one was you've got the iconic rock
stars going down the middle and then
inside the lining is this gorgeous
bright orange we've got a difficult and
then - ah my Cohen hotel this is where
we stayed on the rimmel trips last year
that proves how long it's been since I
wore this bag so yeah I got this from
Selfridges I did pay full price for this
and then two weeks later went down in
sales I was very interested to see that
it could save myself
couple hundred pounds but I had worn it
loads so I wasn't too disappointed so
this you'll start to see me wearing this
again very soon now the weather is
getting better and it's a smooth
beautiful summer handbag and with R&amp;amp;T
knows they don't read change their
design that much they change the leather
pattern but they haven't changed this
design in so many years so I'm really
pleased that this is such a classic and
I will wear it for many years to come
I think the next bag that I bought was
my Gucci dionysus but I'm not entirely
sure it could have been another one but
this cuales the first bag that I really
revealed on YouTube I did an unboxing
video for this which if you missed any
like to see it I'll leave it linked down
below because I go into a lot of detail
about the bag in that video this is a
gorgeous gorgeous bag it is the darkness
of blooms it's got this gorgeous floral
detail on it this was another one that
when I first got it it was all over my
Instagram I definitely Instagram found
this it's such a photogenic bag it took
me a long time to like this bag I know
in the comments of the unboxing video a
lot of people were like oh it's
disgusting I thought it was disgusting
it closed - but it really grew on me and
now I just love it
the dollar's bags they are still very
much in fashion and I think I'll
probably wear this a lot more again in
autumn but I feel like I do want to wear
the volunteer more in the spring summer
months this next one
is a bit of a momentous occasion in my
vlogging career because it's actually
the first designer bag that I was gifted
for free from a designer how ridiculous
is that and it is the Bulgari certainty
forever bag I know a lot of bloggers
were also gifted this Bible a lot a few
bloggers will also get to this bag and I
felt incredibly lucky to you one of the
chosen few
this bag is inspired by jewelry vulgar
jewelry brand and you really do feel
like you're wearing an exquisite piece
of fine jewelry when you are wearing
this bag it's just so beautiful so
intricate and you've got this gorgeous
certainty clasp on the front which
really is very much like the brands
jewelry this is ironically also the most
expensive bag in my collection I think
it's retails for around the 2,500 pound
mark it is very luxurious the
craftsmanship in this bag is absolutely
stunning got so many beautiful details
you've got this snake strap it's almost
like a snake leather that the bags
actually made out of it really is
spectacular I will continue to wear this
for very special events any weddings
christenings that seems like that when I
have an incredibly special event this in
my parrot ear bag next up is another one
which I get so much use out of and it is
my smaller Valentina Roxas so this one
was purchased with a voucher that I got
from Farfetch'd the voucher didn't cover
the entire amount of the bag but it did
make it more affordable for me I
actually had this bag on my wish list
for a long time after spotting it on
oakenshield Instagram and it was almost
one of those meant to be moments because
I was seriously weighing up buying it
but obviously a little bit hesitant
because of the price and then I had an
opportunity to work with far-fetched and
the payment was the voucher and that
made this bag a lot more affordable for
me so that was one of those occasions I
really felt like it meant to be the
colour of this bag makes it so practical
for numerous seasons or two it works
great during festive seasons it is
metallic but I think because it is so
neutral it's like a Goldy pewter color
it is looks beautiful with so many
outfits I always take this on holiday
with me as well I wear over the body and
it's great for fitting me on camera a
little bit of Sun cream maybe sunglasses
and I love wearing it over the body
and you can just relax knowing that it's
safe I need to still got your hands-free
so this is a gorgeous one and yeah I get
tons of you throughout this one as well
then these are the really recent ones
now you'll probably recognize all of
these firstly we have my little Gucci I
think this is called the maman I
probably should know this I think it's a
Milan design but I chose the beautiful
chevron design I thought it was really
striking and this was just as small
crossbody bags or really starting to
come into fashion
I wear this so much I get tons of use
out of this it's a great size that fits
everything that I need for an everyday
essential I love this up recently in the
Lake District I wore it like over my
Waterproof not when it was raining
obviously I don't want to treat it that
badly but because the Chevron it's so
striking and it's just incredibly
comfortable to wear it goes with so many
outfits yeah love this and have no
regrets with purchasing this it was
expensive
once again I did actually work with net
supporter so had a voucher that I could
put towards the cost of this bag I want
to mention those pointers because I feel
like it would be almost dishonest of me
to go through my designer handbag
collection and not tell you if I was
gifted one or if I had a voucher towards
it a lot of bloggers do get batches and
do get gifted and they don't declare it
and I think that's a little bit like you
know I think I'd rather just be honest
with you guys because that's how I can
afford these bags this one I bought all
by myself
no gifting move out remove discount
codes this is a wire sell bag that I
treated myself to after Christmas I
think that I just was looking back and
reflecting at my year and this was
almost like a well done present I guess
I just I work SuperDuper hard last year
I wanted to treat myself been wanting
this bag for a long time so I decided to
special the most beautiful color it's a
very me color I feel like it's a very me
back in general once again it can be
worn over the body and I'm really
looking forward to wearing this a lot
more in the summer months I got this
from never Porter and it's a beautiful
spongy but Peverley leather so it's very
resistant to any scratches hopefully it
won't get any dark marks if I do wear it
with denim jeans I'll be very careful
because I do not want to get any color
transfer on this one which you are at
risk of wears pale colored bags
time and finally last but not least my
most recent addition to my bag
collection actually now just realizes
normal okay so this is still the most
recent addition to my bag collection and
this is my wire fell below the bag
I didn't unboxing video for this very
very recently so I'll leave that links
down below it is very annoying that
doesn't fit in my phone in I have an
iPhone 7 plus but I still have worn it a
lot since I got it it's so cute and it
gets tons and tons of compliments and is
very photogenic and I nearly forgot to
show you this of course this is
currently my everyday handbag this is my
similar on I keep wanting to call it the
sack to sure but I don't think that's
what is called I'll leave the correct
name on the screen now this is a big
wide sell bucket bag incredibly
practical it fits so much in it got all
my daily shizzle in there at the moment
it really easily fits my laptop even my
big camera I use this with my trouble
bag with my hand luggage my everyday
hand that I could travel handbag just so
many things so once again really glad I
got this one
so that's it those are all of my
designer handbags I guess you probably
noticed a running train through all of
those and all of my explanations every
single one I'm so glad I decided to
splurge on that one I feel like I've not
made any mistakes with these handbags I
really like to think very long and hard
about a designer purchase before I
actually part with my money because
obviously they are not cheap at all so I
want to make sure that I'm really
getting things going aware over and over
again each of these bags is so true to
my personal style and really fits in
well with my wardrobe so I do feel like
I've got good price per wear out of all
of my purchases so I really hope you
