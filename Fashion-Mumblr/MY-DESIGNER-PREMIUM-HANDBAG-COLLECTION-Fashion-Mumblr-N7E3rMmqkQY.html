much for joining me for today's video
this is one that has been requested
quite a lot recently and it is my
designer handbag collection now I did
this video originally about a year ago I
think it was the end of March that I
published my first designer handbag
collection video and I'm not going to
repeat the same bags twice so if you
want to see my full handbag collection
every single to sign it back by own then
I will leave my first designer handbag
video linked up on the screen and down
below so check that one out after this
one if you'd like to see my full
collection so in the space of a year
since that video has been filmed I have
added a few new designer handbags to my
collection but I would say that the
majority of these bags are more premium
high-street I don't really know where
the definition is between premium and
designer but some of these bags for
example Kate Spade I'm not sure if that
would qualify as a designer handbag in
many terms so for that reason I'm going
to be calling this my premium and design
a handbag haul I do have a lot of
premium handbags and they are amongst my
favorite bags in my collection so I
thought I would combine the two for
today's video everything that I
mentioned in this video all of these
bags will be linked down below so
hopefully a few of them will still be in
stock I will try to find all of them
where possible so just open up the
description box if you would like to
find links to any of the pieces
mentioned alright so I'm going to very
quickly talk about my latest and newest
designer handbag it is my mulberry
zipped Bayswater this one here and I
very recently did a what's in my handbag
video where I showed you what is inside
here this is my everyday handbag it's
got all of my stuff in there at the
moment so this is the one that I'm using
the most at this moment in time I will
again leave that video linked down below
so you can have little nosy as to what's
inside and more details about this bag
but this is the latest bag to my
collection that the one that I'm using
currently as my everyday handbag it's
incredibly versatile it's an amazing
size I often have my laptop in here at
the moment it's just filled with you
know day to day pieces but it fits my
laptop it fits a big notebook
it fits my big SLR camera so it's just
an incredibly useful bag I would highly
highly recommend if you are looking for
an everyday Hamburg this is the zipped
Bayswater and I believe
the shade is called blush rose and I
absolutely adore it so this is the
newest handbag in my collection next up
is this trunk bag from Aspinall and this
is one of those pieces that instantly
just makes your whole outfit look
absolutely incredible I personally love
pairing this actually with this coat
this is my research at coat and you'll
have seen this in so many of my
instagrams I just absolutely adore it I
think it's it's a very statement piece
because of the shape and the size of it
I mean the detail on the top here you've
got the signature Aspinall lock which is
how it opens and closes and all the
metal detail on the corners is just
absolutely beautiful very very well made
and I think a really good price for such
a statement bag it is I think just under
five hundred pounds which for a designer
bag I think is making it more on the
affordable end of the scale and it
really is the most beautiful statement
piece it does fit an iPhone 7 or 8 plus
in there and a vlogging camera and your
credit card wallet and a little bit of
makeup not too much out then you don't
really need too much more with you if
you're just wearing this to nip out the
shops or something nipping out shopping
with friends sometimes I often will wear
this and carry a big bag as well and
this is like the statement bag having
everything that I need really close to
me my phone might always to card my
credit card things like that and then
the majority of my stuff will be in my
big bag so I've surprised myself with
how much I've used this one and I do
also have it in this plain brown color
as well this is the one that I got
originally when I saw it on the website
I thought you know what I'm just gonna
try something different
I didn't know if I would love it or not
but I love this so much and I wore this
one so much that I could not resist that
I could not resist getting a second and
I went to the arsenal' press day not too
long ago and they're bringing it out in
a transparent color with a big lion on
the front you might have seen me
featuring it in my spring trends video
they very kindly loaned it to me for
that video and then also they're
bringing it out with different shades of
brown on the front and that big line
knocker in the middle so hopefully maybe
they'll add a third one to my collection
before too long
next up and these really are in no
particular order is another mulberry bag
this one I actually got at the MacArthur
Glen Designer Outlet Center up in
Cheshire Oaks I saw it in the shop and I
could not resist it this was about 300
pounds less than the shop price so I got
a really good bargain with this
and I don't know I just really felt like
spoiling myself that day I thought the
color of it was so beautiful very very
me I don't have a bright pink it doesn't
bag I thought it'd be a lovely way of
adding pinky to my wardrobe if I was
wearing a very neutral code outfit and
it really is the most gorgeous gorgeous
bag very practical size as well very
roomy inside you've got a envelope
pocket you've got a zipper pocket here
as well I don't think there's anything
inside and then you've got another
little envelope pocket there so
surprisingly spacious bag it does have a
long shoulder strap as well so this can
be worn crossbody which i think is a
really beautiful way of wearing it now
that we're going back into spring and
pink is once again a big color for the
season I will definitely be getting a
lot more use out of this one then we
have my Radley lavender Gardens handbag
this again is a really practical size if
it's so much inside it and I really like
the boxy shape of this one I feel like
it really does make a statement but in
quite a subtle and contemporary way the
strap the strap has got this really
unusual almost hand-painted design on
one side and then it's totally plain on
the other so you can really choose how
you wear this once again this can be
worn crossbody I tend to wear it just by
carrying it by the strap I was with one
of my outfits during Fashion Week I feel
like all of my things are very organized
when they're inside you've got that
zipper pocket here two little envelope
pockets two big compartments and then
one more big zipper pocket at the back
so I really feel like everything has got
its place and it's this beautiful
Saffiano style leather so it really is
quite hard wearing considering it's
white I think that's really really
important this leather has not scratched
it's not got any marks on it whatsoever
but what I would say is that lighter
colored bags if you do wear a lot of
dark colors obviously I don't really
wear too many dark colors but if you
were to wear dark colored jeans for
example and wear this bag I would be
wary of color transferring from your
jeans on to the bag so maybe if you do
invest in something like this and stick
it to the lighter colors with what you
wear away this is almost definitely my
favorite bag that I've added to my
collection oh I don't know I love
actually no I don't know if this is
undoubtedly one of my favorite bags I've
added to my collection since I last
filmed a design of my collection and it
is my Chloe bracelet bag in this
all gold color so if you saw my last
handbag collection video you'll see me
talking about my Valentino glam lock bag
which is also gold and I told you how
much I wear it I find that the metallic
gold color goes with so many things it
can be worn with it can be worn with
quite a casual outfit in the daytime or
really dressed up in the evening and I
find this exactly the same I would say
almost every special occasion I've gone
to since getting this bag I have worn
this bag with that outfit whether that's
to cocktail parties or Christmas dinners
or even the BAFTAs I wore it to all of
those events and I absolutely adore it
it doesn't fit a huge amount inside I
can just about get my phone and floggin
camera but it is quite a squeeze it does
have a crossbody strap but it's finished
I tend not to even connect that and I
just wear it with the bracelets I think
it's great that you can just sling it in
the crook of your arm and then you can
have one hand free and your glass of
Prosecco in the other hand so it really
is a very very practical bag and totally
beautiful
I'm absolutely smitten with this so no
regrets with that one it was very
expensive for a small handbag but I
adore it and I've already got so much
use out of it next up is another
favorite bag and it is my aspinall
Dockery handbag I think this is such a
meat bag I absolutely adore the color
this beautiful very very wearable pink
shade it's surprisingly roomy once again
I can fit all of my essentials in here
obviously not my laptop but most
definitely it fits my vlogging camera my
purse loads of makeup everything like
that sunglasses you name it all fits in
here once again I wore this one during
Fashion Week and I feel like it's such a
beautiful addition to an outfit a lot of
these bags are statement in a way that
they really just complete the look and
you can be wearing a very plain outfit
and add the bag and it just instantly
adds so many style points with this one
it is a smooth leather but considering
at how much I've worn it it doesn't
appear to have any scratch it's maybe a
tiny tiny little scratch there but you
really I had to go looking for that so
it's not obvious at all so beautiful
stitch detail you've got this gorgeous
little aspinall lock feature here this
little almost almost like little petal
shape I just think Aspinall bags are
created so so beautifully the
craftsmanship with the quality of this
bag and how
stunning it looks honestly I think that
you could pass this bra like a 2,000
pound Fendi bag literally every single
detail is so stunning right down to the
metal used on the clasps all the details
are just absolutely absolutely perfect I
like to wear this one either by holding
it by the handle or if I've got my hands
full and I will wear it crossbody again
during Fashion Week I wore this with my
Reis beige coat baby pink coat and the
whole look was just so pink and feminine
and pastel it was really really it
really wasn't my favorite outfits if I
can find a photo of that outfit I'll
leave it on the screen now not actually
sure if I took outfit of the day photos
but yeah it does look absolutely
beautiful and because it is such a
beautiful pastel pink again I'll be
wearing the slots in upcoming it's
spring photoshoots and spring days out
things like that so yes absolutely
smitten with this Dockery bag from Aspen
or another crossbody bag and this is my
velvet capes fade bag this was actually
a gift from Kate Spade when I went to
New York with them last November and I
absolutely adore it it is a grey velvet
so if you stroke it it goes different
colors depending on which way you brush
it material inside it's just one big
compartment with some little envelopes
you've got a zippy envelope that's
what's this the care card and and then
and then an open envelope pocket in
there as well once again fits just about
the essentials not too much more
vlogging camera phone lipstick credit
cards and I really really love the
chunky chain strap on this I think that
especially with winter outfits this
chunky chain really does make a
beautiful statement one one crossbody
with a big cozy white knit it looks
absolutely gorgeous I wore this a lot
while we were in New York and I've worn
it loads while we've been back well
we've been back in the UK as well I
think just like Aspen or Kate Spade have
got that really lovely price point where
it's in between high street and designer
so you get the beautiful quality the
amazing craftsmanship but you're not
paying a super inflated prices so I'm a
big fan of that kind of mid-range price
point and this is one of my favorite
bags from that premium end of the high
street I think this is probably the most
expensive bag in this video I think and
this is my wire sales sunset bag I need
to wear this bag more
kind of not forgot about it but I just
haven't reached for it in quite a long
time I've been really just I don't know
I've almost been too busy to swap
handbags that regularly recently which
is totally crazy and now that I've
pulled this out of my collection I'm
gonna make myself wear this a lot more
because it was an expensive handbag and
it is so beautiful still being sold
still very much in fashion and I
absolutely love it inside this you have
got a selection of pockets three main
sections quite a big envelope pocket
here and then the middle section is
split into two as you can see there and
then you've got the little zipper pocket
inside you can wear this with the chain
doubled over if it does have this
leather section which makes it really
comfortable if your bag is quite heavy
and you choose to wear it crossbody this
does not dig in to your skin if you
haven't had bare shoulders so I often
will pull the strap to full length and
wear it across body like that but
sometimes if I just want to over the
crook of my arm or over my shoulder
without it being crossbody then I will
double up the strap so lots of different
ways to wear this bag I mentioned in my
video about investing in I think the
video is all about how to invest in a
designer bag how to choose the right
investment pieces I'll leave it linked
on the screen when I remember which one
it was and I mentioned that when looking
to invest in a designer bag you should
look for a very neutral color which this
is something which is branded but not in
a way that's going to go out of fashion
again another tick and you should look
for really I think the video is how to
buy tips on how to buy a designer
handbag I think man said it was and then
I also spoke about looking at the type
of leather this is again that kind of
croc effect leather extremely hard
wearing doesn't show any scratches the
corners have not been battered or
bruised there's nono areas where you can
see any wear and tear and so when you're
spending that amount of money I think
it's really important that your bag
looks perfect for many many years so
choosing a more versatile leather like
this is really really important so yeah
check that video out cuz loads and those
tips in that on how to invest in
designer pieces wisely another very
recent bag to my collection is this one
from LK Bennett this is an incredibly
lightweight handbag I think this would
make a perfect everyday bag if you don't
need to carry a laptop or a really big
camera or big books around with you then
this I think is a fabulous everyday bag
it's got the gorgeous little press stud
the middle which is a fabulous way of
opening it and then a huge spacious
section inside here really really roomy
easy to see all of your bits and bobs
zippy pockets and two inside pockets as
well this Jennifer mentioned is from LK
Bennett so it is available on the high
street I think is about three hundred
and fifty pounds so it is a premium
piece but the quality of this once again
beautiful stitching beautiful detail on
the handle and then you've got this
gorgeous soft leather and then suede at
the sides which is a really nice
contrast between the smooth leather and
then the more textured suede the color
of this is very very me it goes with all
of my outfits I think a neutral bag like
this is incredibly versatile and once
again another one I'll be getting a lot
more use out of this spring season one
more from Kate Spade and if you guys
follow me on Instagram then you'll have
seen me using this so so so much it is
my baby it's cold outside tote this
before my mulberry was my everyday bag
where I would just chuck everything
inside it would just contain absolutely
everything like tissues makeup bags
tripods cameras sunglasses magazines
everything would be inside this bag it
was a real never full type Mary Poppins
handbag always absolutely filled to the
brim with bits and bobs now I feel like
it's a little bit wintry so I have
swapped the mulberry for my everyday bag
but I use this when for example I'm
going over to mums for the night or
going to stay with Charlie's mom and dad
then I will pop my sleepover things in
here or if I'm going anywhere where I
need a little bit more stuff with me
then I will chuck it all in here so a
very very handy bag and I'm really
excited to wear this again next winter
when it's cold outside again in November
I did a collaboration with Michael Kors
for their SmartWatch which you guys
which you guys know I absolutely love
and as part of that I was sent this
handbag from Michael Kors I don't think
I'd ever owned a Michael Kors bag before
road always lusted after them this is a
really really versatile satchel style
bag in the brown color I think it's
incredibly wearable goes with so many
different outfit combinations
once again you can wear it by just
slinging it over your arm with the big
top strap or you can use the full length
strap for crossbody and even this one is
adjustable in length so very very
versatile depending on how you want to
wear it so you have once again at that
push lock system at the front and inside
very very spacious very roomy you
got a couple of clips here so really
good if you want to clip your house keys
or anything else super secure they've
just thought of everything here and then
you've got a zippy pockets there is
nothing inside there at the moment and
then quite a few pockets on this front
section here it's even got a strap with
a clip here so if again so again if you
want your purse to be extra safe you can
just clip that in there I feel like
they've just thought of so many
different things with this and when it's
empty again this is a really light hand
bag so if you are looking for something
lightweight and really really versatile
then that's a lovely one to take those
boxes I have this adorable little bag
from Radley and this is their Chinese
New Year bag it seemed like the perfect
collaboration from them with this year
being the year of the dog this has got
the little Radley Scottie dog and some
Chinese lanterns I actually have not
used this handbag yet it is very new to
my collection they're very very kindly
centers over
I think this is a perfect size for
crossbody when you do have another bag
with you you just want to have your
essentials really close by
perhaps if you are going on a dinner
date this would be a really lovely
evening bag so it does have this
crossbody strap in at the red leather
you can see I've not even taken it apart
yet really excited to wear this I think
with a trench coat or perhaps even just
like a jeans and t-shirt combination
this will instantly add a statement that
kind of look so actually I said my
mother is my newest bag but this only
arrived a few days ago so this is my
newest designer handbag from Radley and
we are down to the last two bags both of
which are from Aspen all of London and
firstly we have or nearly lastly we have
this little silver crossbody bag this is
another bag that I reach for on special
occasions I really like that it's a mix
between silver and gold because actually
most of my accessories are gold so the
fact that it does have the gold and the
silver means it's very wearable and
works with all of my different
accessories especially my Valentino rock
studs which other shoes I tend to wear
on special occasions as vanilla always
have a very similar look feature this is
almost like a postman lock doesn't fit
too much inside not gonna lie you kind
of have to choose between your phone or
your camera or normal people that don't
carry a camera around would choose would
be able to fit their photo in their
purse and some lipsticks and things in
there so it is a big enough size for an
evening bag when I've worn this I have
worn this crossbody really lovely long
so it goes all the way across the body
great if you are turning up to your
special event in a coat you can be
hands-free to collect your glass of
champagne but you can also just cluster
up all the chains and use it as a clutch
bag and just hold it in your hand like
that so a really really beautiful tiny
evening bag from Espanola and then
lastly you guys may have recognized this
again from my Instagram another bag from
astron all the lock is a very similar
shape with this almost pedal detail I
think it's meant to be like a shield or
like a family emblem I'm not sure I need
to I need to research the reason why
Aspen will have this petal shape but
this is a squeeze lock there we go
and inside very very smart handbag big
asipi compartment does have a shoulder
strap which I don't actually use it even
comes with a little mirror inside which
is so handy and then you've got these
two big sections and the envelope
pockets there this I would say is
probably my smartest handbag if I want
to look really professional last time I
wore this was with my Burberry Burberry
my high street trench coat which looks
like a Burberry trench coat and I felt
very smart and put together and this is
my kind of like work what I bagged but
then it does have the fun detail of the
leopard print there and the leopard
print on the handle and then a beautiful
astronaut of London logo on the back
with a little magnetic and below pocket
there so really handy for your Oyster
card or your mobile phone so that my
darlings is my full handbag collection
my designer bags and as I mentioned at
the beginning you can see the rest of my
designer bags by watching the video like
this I did last year please excuse my
very strangely bleached hair in that
video and also the premium handbags that
I do have in my collection which I love
just as much as my designer bags all of
these I absolutely adore no regrets with
purchasing any of these handbags I love
all of them I wear all of them a lot a
few here I need to wear a little bit
more and I'm excited to wear more now
