vlog this week I'm doing some really
cool stuff and there's a few changes
going on in my life in the next coming
weeks which I thought I would record and
share with you all because some of
things are gonna be really exciting
change arms is a human already I'm
obviously not very good at this and so
today I've got a couple of really cool
things going on firstly there is an
event with benefit cosmetics and benefit
events are always really fun I say
always but I've only actually been to
one before but I always see on other
girls vlogs that they always look really
fun the last one I went to was when they
took over this white space in Covent
Garden and we basically had a massive
blogger and youtuber paint right to
celebrate the launch of their their
realness or in line at coming out a new
colors that was amazing
so Tom's inking but today I don't really
know what's happening the invitation is
always really cryptic all it said was
that they're going to sweep us off our
feet and then one of the emails from the
girls afterwards said that she hopes
that I'm not afraid of heights so should
be really good fun I'm not sure what to
expect so I will let you guys know how
that goes so outfit of the day I'm
wearing this white or it's actually more
creamy roll next leaders top which I got
from warehouse last year and I've tucked
it into some new rust-colored trousers
and pop trousers which you've got
recently from Topshop they've got a bow
fastening on the waist but it's always
really knowing as I can never make the
bow as pretty as it is when you first
buy it and I think I'm gonna have
I say I'm but I'm just going to use my
hair straighteners to get rid of this
little glitch here and then I'm wearing
my favorite little shoes from Dorothy
Perkins these were the ones which were
only 29 pounds I love when they've got
this kind of gold and bit behind the
heel I'm actually heading to the office
before I go to the benefit event so got
to be quite smart normally for a blog
event I'd wear something a little bit
more fun but this is office appropriate
as well so I'm gonna head to work now
and I'll see you guys at benefit
okay so just left work and I'm now
heading towards the benefit event it's
really gross gray ringing for to put my
body up and so we read the invitation
and it said that we have to take our
seats
so don't know if it's going to be some
kind of simulator or a ride or something
I'm looking around me and there aren't
really any high buildings which kind of
makes me think that it is going to be
some kind of simulator so I'm feeling
kind of nervous no really don't have any
idea what to expect so we've just found
out we do we're going to have dinner at
the crane in the sky and
it's great time you guys yeah
which is all the natural range of
emotions you go to
one of the guys just said that there's a
lightning storm and the crane of the
last investment brought in the skies so
we've got to head back
so just finished work for the day just
left the office and I'm now on odd
Street heading towards John Lewis
because parents are really kindly
offered me the chance to try out their
massage they think it's just a 25 minute
treatment I can have a massage or a
facial but definitely feeling like a
massage because I'm holding maybe about
four different bags they always come
away from work with loads of bags
because I get a little my log of things
sent there
so a bit like a camel just carrying
loads and stuff so definitely need to
have a back massage so that should be
really really nice heading into the
store now
so I showed massage and down to my
that's my arm
oh yeah they just go up to the 69th to
love the shot and annoyingly is
MetroCard it mimics a car I see the view
behind me that is clearing so I think by
the end of the class if you have a
better year
viewing people behind me
so you've just had our yoga car from $69
the shark three lovely nice relaxing way
to start Friday morning and they're so
beautiful at the end of Sunday night's
just so gorgeous so feeling really
refreshed and ready for the day and I've
just now come up to the 72nd floor which
is all open the you can see behind me
like that's that is the gasp it's you
can see the tops of shards so this is
very very cool experience to be here
when no one else is here and the Sun has
just come out it's just so so stunning I
just
left the office and I'm on my way
my first birthday which is in East
London that in old sweets don't we know
this area very well I always feel like
I'm not really cool enough for all the
street but heading that way now wearing
obviously not my yoga stuff anymore I've
got change to my favourite Oasis talk
and Rhys news
so I finished my meeting and just done
really nice food markets down one of the
streets in old Street so grab some lunch
so I just picked up a pork wrap which
I'm gonna pretty eating the goat some
bit late for my next meeting so just
gonna hop on the tube now
so just got to the barium luxury and
we've come into the boardroom and I
can't even imagine men in suits in this
room because it's like the girliest pink
is room I've ever seen in my life lately
apart from my 15 year old bedroom but
anyway so we are here in the boardroom
and behind me this is the boots layout
services where they sell the very outer
space
so behind leader is a machine which is
pumping liquid into containers and it's
filling up their new prime which isn't
even in stores yet so we're getting that
cheap sequences with any product
so have you ever wondered how lipsticks
looks so perfect when they come out of
the - they always have such a perfect
crisp edge on them no fingerprints or
anything well this machine behind me
here basically covers the lipsticks in
almost like a flame which makes them
perfectly smooth ready for when you take
marketing
so we are currently in the development
area this is where they develop all the
new products it's like a science lab
full of beauty products basically I'm in
heaven right now
and we're about to robot and go
so I have just put on the lip gloss that
we just made this is the new REM live
boss not sure they're gonna put in shops
but I definitely recommend it's a really
nice soft coral color and we put mango
and Tony in Sri as well so it looks good
and it smells amazing just left the
berry Emma factory that was so much fun
really got to see behind the scenes of
how the makeup was made it's so funny I
use barium all the time I used to be
absolutely obsessed with their glitter
dust parts and now I love every just
everything all their contour kits and
nail varnishes so it's so amazing to
have a look around the factory and see
how it's all married typical English
whether it is pouring with rain again
this is horrible drizzle but but to get
on the tube and head back to the office
for a few more hours work and then
Charlie and I are out to dinner tonight
- and maximum place around Shepherds
Bush so I'll take you along with me
there but for now back to the office
I just had a really lovely meal at the
Habanera restaurant which is near the
fish market
definitely recommend sweet potato fries
at the chipotle sauce if you ever come
here
and seriously good tacos Charlie and I
both had tacos think the Three Little
Pigs thing was my favorite but some
churros that you're taking home and
pretty gonna sit in them until watched
on TV and eat the recipe so we got any
face book here and I'll see you tomorrow
yo
we just had a really lovely afternoon
tea at the Kachina a Celina which is in
the Emir hotel and now Charlie and I
were just going to have a little walk to
burn it all off we work them through
Somerset House I think we're just gonna
head down to the riverbank and come back
towards more to do before we head home
again
seeing as we are in Somerset House the
home of me out there today I thought I
just couldn't show you what I'm wearing
so my top is from French Connection it's
really lovely embroidered
I thought like keep children which are
from Zara and then my shoes my scene
with the outfit of the day pictures and
my shoes are from dr. Perkins is VMAs 29
pounds ones which
so chugging I've just got home the
opening scenes do have just disappear
that's almost five o'clock already I
think I'm going to spend the rest of the
afternoon just tidying up and poking a
few blog photos I have pretty much like
over a month's worth of blog photos that
I need to take got so many exciting
things pumped the blogs I actually need
to do some photography to make sure that
happens
so just made myself a nice cup of tea
good old builders brew and I'm gonna
crack on with that later on that Charlie
has got a couple of friends coming over
for the guys coming to you watch the
England versus broke the game so I'll
just stick my headphones in and edit
this vlog because I really think of
course on this vlog to go out tomorrow
