morning routine video so this is what I
get up to you on the weekends and I like
to do a shortened version of this on the
weekdays too
so my days start bright and early I seem
to have chained my body to wake up at
around 7 a.m. and naturally and the
first thing that I do is make the bed I
feel a whole lot more organized and less
stress if my bedroom is tidy so making
the bed is a key part of this then I'm
popping on my dressing-gown this pajama
and dressing-gown combination is my
favorite at the moment it's so lovely
and cozy and snuggly which is also
important on those cheat January
mornings giving my little chat a kiss
and you'll be pleased to know that if
you features quite a lot in this video
I even have sausage dog slippers these
ones are from Jules and I just
absolutely love them then I'm heading
downstairs followed by my little shadow
and into the kitchen where I'm pouring
myself a glass of water I like to put a
little bit of salt in my water as well
as you might remember from my mindful
morning routine so this really helps to
kickstart the digestive system and then
also I'm making myself a cup of tea this
one is a lemon and ginger tea this is
really good at just two toxifying the
body and really helping to kick-start
the immune system too so while I'm
drinking those I'm going to do my
skincare routine this morning I'm
cleansing and toning starting off with
my Liz Earle cleanse and polish this one
is an all-time favorite of mine I
actually love this particular one it is
the sweet orange and clove Christmas
edition that I'm still absolutely loving
it so I must wash that all over my face
including over my eye area and it really
helps to just gently cleanse the skin
and then I remove it using a warm damp
Channel then I'm just going to spritz my
face with a trilogy rosehip toner and
then it's into the bedroom where I
continue my skincare routine with the
dolphin Lumiere essential oil serum
love this one and then I follow that
with the live of Cooper skin under eye
cream this one is really great for
hydrating and B puffing the under eye
area
then I'm using the tidal moisturizer
from Sunday Riley this is incredibly
hydrating which I find that my skin's
needs at this time of year in particular
and while that sinks in I'm going
through a little bit of meditation I've
been really good at sticking to my
resolution of meditating every day so
far and I'm using a couple of different
apps just to kick in the morning I use
the calm app just to meditate calm the
mind for about 10 minutes and then I'm
going to be popping on my gym gear ready
to do my workout as always my whole
dream outfit is from a threatened Betty
now I'm going to be applying a little
bit of makeup I do like to wear some
light makeup for the gym I'm puffing on
my vibes Harry sell euros CC cream just
to even out my complexion and then I'm
popping on some benefit for our gel
Justin even out those brows really look
a little bit less scary I need to
moisturize my lips with a Clarins lip
oil this also adds a little hint of
color too and I'm packing my gym bag
with my ipod my wireless earphones the
nails yars remedies natural deodorants
and hair bubbles and my water bottle
tube and then this sweaty Betty lookup
workout top just helps to keep me a
little bit warmer and poppin on my
trainers and we're ready to go then it's
out the house and I walk to the gym it's
about a 10 to 12 minute walk from my
house I like to power walk and think of
this as my warm-up to my gym routine I'm
a member of the Virgin active gym and I
come here three or four times a week and
I have a personal trainer on two days
too which is a really great help today
I'm working out by myself and I'm going
to start by getting my heart rate up by
doing some high-low sprints on the
treadmill so I do one minute as fast as
I can and then a minute of walking just
to recover then I'm moving on to the
Roman chair as charleen I like to call
it not sure if that's your official name
I work on my abs using my own body
weight doing these body curls and I like
to do about 5 sets of 15 if I can manage
it then I'm working on my legs toning
and building
while using the leg curling machine and
again I like to do four or five
repetitions of this then is on two
squats working on those glutes and I'd
like to use a kettlebell so I also
training the arms at the same time and
then it's really important that I
stretch and I cooldown I like to make
sure that my muscles are nicely
stretched out so I'm not eating too much
the next day when I get back home
there's always someone there to greet me
it's just the best welcome seeing this
little chap so I give him a few kisses
and then I head into the kitchen to make
a breakfast smoothie these little
sachets which I keep in the freezer are
ones I made earlier a mixture of frozen
berries I add these to my thermomix it's
a mix of frozen bananas blueberries
strawberries raspberries and then I'm
adding in the good guru good oats and
berries I've been adding a scoop or two
of this into my smoothies for the past
few months and I find that the oats not
only do they taste really good that also
organic and gluten-free and a really
good source of fiber which means that I
get that slow-releasing energy
throughout the day it means I'm not
snacking which is absolutely great
they're also full of amino acids this
mixture also contains antioxidant rich
freeze-dried berries which makes it
taste absolutely delicious and it's also
got whey protein in there as well which
is great for helping to rebuild that
muscle mass after your workout I'm also
adding in the good guru good berry
superfood powder I want to get the
goodness from the berries but it can be
quite expensive if I buy them fresh
every single week so within these little
sachets they are freeze dried berries
which means that I get all the
antioxidants and vitamins and minerals
all in one handy little pouch then I'm
adding in from our pro vanilla milk this
obviously is the liquid which makes it
into a smoothie and also a teaspoon of
chia seeds which are loaded with fiber
protein omega-3 fatty acids and also
lots of other micronutrients then I whiz
it all up for a few minutes so that it's
all perfectly blended into smoothing at
this point I also take my supplements as
well starting with the good guru good
hair skin and nails tablets these
particular ones really help to support
my beauty routine they contain vitamin C
which contributes to the skin collagen
formulation as well as nutrients to
prevent hair loss and ingredients that
help
healthy nail growth and stop you from
getting any dry brittle nails things
like that then I'm taking some good
turmeric capsules these are really great
at helping any potential joint pain and
inflammation as well as being
antioxidant rich it's no surprise that
turmeric has been used as part of
Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of
years then I'll enjoy my smoothie
because of the oats inside it means I
won't be feeling peckish for quite some
time I head upstairs and enjoy a nice
hot shower then get changed in something
really comfy and cozy then it's into my
office ready to get started on some work
yes you heard that right even on the
weekend I do have a little bit of work
to do the joys of being your own boss so
I settle in to my office room and I
usually start by making a little to-do
list not too many tasks as it is the
weekend after all while I'm working I
enjoy the rest of my breakfast smoothie
and that will really keep me going for
the rest of the morning so that is my
healthy morning routine I really hope

routine down in the comments below
