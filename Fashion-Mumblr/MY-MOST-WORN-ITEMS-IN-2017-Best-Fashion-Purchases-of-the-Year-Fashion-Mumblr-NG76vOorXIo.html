me for today's video I'm really excited
for today's video because I'm going to
be sharing with you my most worn items
of the whole of last year so I had a
really jolly time at lunchtime looking
through my old Instagram posts my old
blog posts just to really refresh my
memory of the pieces I have worn and
loved I guess you could say they are my
best purchases of last year so I'm going
to try to do this season by season
starting way back a year ago in January
2017 and showing you the pieces that I
got the very most wear out of where
possible I'm going to leave everything
link down below but of course a lot of
these pieces may be out of stock or have
a very low stock left in them so I will
try to leave similar or maybe the new
season version of them in the
description box down below so just click
show more if you would like all the
information and shoppable links to all
these pieces if you guys are not new on
my channel and you have seen a few of my
fashion videos before then you'll know
that my real kind of shopping method if
you will is I like to buy investment
pieces I like to buy from mostly the
premium end of the high street and my
style is quite classic which does mean
that a lot of these pieces are premium
pieces or investment pieces and the fact
that they're in this video to me kind of
shows that I chose well I spent my money
wisely and I really managed to get that
price per wear write down in a lot of
the cases the designer things I've
probably worn over a hundred times so
the price part where it really is
minimal which shows to me that I invest
my money well so pat on the back for
those pieces having said that there are
also a few high street pieces in here
and I guess because my style is quite
classic they are pieces that didn't
really go out to style as the seasons
change which did lead me to getting a
lot of use out of them they're not gonna
ramble too much more because I know this
video could be a really really long one
I'm going to try to whiz through the
pieces as quickly as possible I'll try
and leave some links to blog post down
below as well where you can see how I
style the items or maybe videos where
the items featured really prominently
okay so as you can see the rail behind
me which is filled with a lot of my most
worn pieces is very
neutral-colored very whites very pink
and that is my color palette so it's no
surprise that yes I did start to wear
some slightly more bold colors in the
autumn winter months but throughout the
majority of the year my color palette
has been blush pink white nudes those
kind of shades so there's no surprise
that that is what the majority of the
rail consists of if you guys recognize
anything already then well done you
obviously have watched a lot of my
fashion videos let me know in the
comments down below if you've already
spotted something or if you've been able
to predict something that I'm going to
mention in this video so I'm going to
get started with an investment piece and
this is something that I wore a lot this
time last year in January 2017 all the
way through to maybe April and then I
kind of stored it because I don't really
feel like it's a terribly summery bag
because of the burgundy and just the
brown color of it but I have got this
out again recently I started wearing
this again maybe in November 2017 and
I'm wearing it a lot now this is my
Gucci Darnassus blooms handbag this was
really one of my first investment
handbags and I have no regrets of this
bag it's so beautiful so first I'll and
I'm really pleased to see that people
are investing in it again this year 2018
and also at the end of last year I saw a
lot of people investing in this at the
end of 2017 which at that point I'd
already owned it for like nine months so
that was kind of reassuring for me
because I knew that this bag has got
longevity it's going to remain a classic
style handbag so no regrets buying this
if I didn't already own this I probably
would still go out and buy this and I'll
definitely continue to wear this loads
in 2018 as well some footwear that I
wore absolutely loads in the winter
starts of last year again January
February my rustling bromley now I
always used to call these my Highline
boots I was totally wrong these are
called the Jill boots and they are
elasticated at the back and then they
got suede at the front they've got a
little tiny platform in the sole of the
foot and then they've got a suede chunky
heel now for me these are these are such
a great investment at the moment they're
in the sale I will leave them link down
below I think there are about 200 pounds
of these I think I spent around 480
pounds on three two or three years ago
no regrets with these again price per
wear is incredible I've looked after
them pretty well
I always keep tree boots inside
them I do actually have a video on how
to care for your over new boots so I'll
leave that I'm linked up on the screen
and down below it's very important to
look after your investment Footwear but
because they're black and they're so
comfortable they just went with so many
things and they've got so much use out
of these so in February 2017 of course
it was Fashion Week and I rewatched my
Fashion Week video and it reminded me
that that was a time that I started to
wear this I think I got this maybe maybe
towards the end of 2016 but I really
wore this a lot during kind of
Valentine's Day period because of course
it is a jumper it's nice and warm but
the frill and sleeves meant that I wore
this all the way into spring 2017 as
well and I'm so excited to start wearing
it again this was from Club Monaco so
again premium high street I probably
spent about 200 pounds on this I think
I've got it from America though so maybe
a tad cheaper but price per wear once
again you're going to hear me say this a
lot it's really really good on this
piece it is quite a statement piece
because of the ruffles around the
sleeves but the color is beautiful the
quality is gorgeous I wore this with I
think either high-waisted and I wore it
with high-waisted white trousers for my
London Fashion Week lookbook and I wore
it I think with a kind of tweed skirt
for my romantic lookbook which went live
at the end of last January or early last
February still to this date it's my
favorite video if you guys haven't seen
that video yet it's basically my style
shot in a beautiful house in like a
bridal suite it's my favorite video I've
ever shot so please check that or now
it's after this and if you haven't seen
it yet and re watching that video and
the fashion week one just reminded me
how much I loved and still love and wore
this piece in the winter moving on to
spring last year flicking through old
blog posts reminded me how much I wore
this top last spring time as well this
is from Reese and it is a ribbed kind of
top it's sleeveless so it's really good
if you are layering and you don't want
to feel all bundled up but you still
want some warmth on your body this is
great for that it's got a little zip
here so you don't get loads of makeup on
it when you're putting it on but I found
the high neckline just to be a really
classic very feminine but also quite a
professional look hopefully they've got
something similar on the website now if
not keep an eye on the Reese website
going into spring because they often
repeat styles year after year especially
popular ones
like pieces like this the way that I'm
most frequently wore this last year was
with skirts I know I wore it with a tool
kind of netted to to like skirt for my
spring lookbook
and then on the blog I'll insert a photo
here I also styled it with a beautiful
skirt from Club Monaco it had a scholar
hem at the bottom full of beautiful
embroidery and that's an outfit that
again I'll wear this spring
- speaking of retailers like Reis
bringing things back into store season
after season with just a few design
details this is a coat that I got from
Reis
last winter slash spring and I've
actually seen that they fought it back
to game this year so I will leave this
year's version linked down below because
I wore this so much for moving into
spring and also summer on their slightly
chillier days last year not sure what
color the camera is picking this up as
but it is I'm using some artificial
light because it's so gloomy outside but
this is a very light almost gray lilac
color it's got these beautiful buttons
really beautiful shape it's almost quite
a masculine silhouette it's got this
Cape detail at the back but then you do
have this belt which means you can draw
it in at the waist to give yourself a
beautiful feminine silhouettes I think
this was maybe around the 200 250 pound
price mark but I felt like it really
added that luxury touch just so many of
my outfit so I wore this absolutely
loads Reiss obviously knew that it was
the winner so as I said they have bought
it back this year with a few design
tweaks so I'll be wearing this a lot
this spring and linking you guys to the
new edition of it so I think it's about
the time of year that I was wearing this
that I also got my hands on these and
these are probably my most worn shoes of
the whole of last year they went into
sale recently I know there are a few
sizes left but if I don't manage to find
these then I'll leave something similar
link down below I get a lot of questions
about these these shoes are an outfit
saver they make so many outfits look
amazing they elevate so many looks if
I'm wearing trousers skirts dresses
especially ankle length skirts or midi
skirts these shoes were my go-to and
also I wore these to muddy fields I wore
them in rain and oh my goodness how much
do they look as though they are brand
new I'm so impressed with the quality of
these they're from Reese I think I paid
around maybe up to 170
answer these they weren't cheap at all
but boy oh boy that priceco Ware has
been amazing with these I have no
regrets I would buy them all over again
I love them so much got so so so much
use out of them the color is perfect
they are slightly lighter keep I'd say
they're more of a gray suede mules and I
love them so much another piece that I
wore absolutely loads throughout the
spring and summer was this top again
from Reese a lot of reason here I really
love those premium high street retailers
this is a t-shirt but it's a little bit
different to usual t-shirt because it's
made of this ribbed fabric hopefully you
can kind of see there if I give you a
bit of a close-up it is ribbed a little
bit thicker than your usual t-shirt
style this I wore with jeans and with
skirts I wore with midi skirts so many
outfit combinations it just looked a lot
smarter and like you'd put a little bit
more thought into your outfit than a
normal t-shirt and I wore this a lot
with maybe a single pendant necklace
obviously maimana covenant and necklaces
were probably my most worn jewelry
pieces and might quickly talk through
some of my most worn jewelry things at
the end of the video so stay tuned for
that a lot of classic investment pieces
there but yeah got loads of use out of
this tons of outfit post on my blog
feature of this t-shirt from Reese so
I'm a little bit embarrassed as to how
dirty these are but it shows how well
use they are these are my Stuart
Weitzman pearl heeled sandals now so
many shops on the high street copied
these this year I in fact bought a few
copies of them because I wanted some
variations but these are the original
and the best pearl heel sandals from
Stuart Weitzman I think I first showed
you these in my spring lookbook again
with that tool almost to to like midi
skirt such a beautiful combination I
wore these a lot to special events I
think I wore them to Roy Alaska I
definitely wall into a few summer
weddings because of the chunky heel they
were great for walking on grass and
they're just so comfortable I'll also
leave a few of my favorite dupes down
below I think public desire like ego you
can pick them up really cheap as chips
you can get boots with the beautiful
pearls in the heel too now they really
were a standout style for 2017 and a
style that I love so much I'll
definitely be wearing this year to my
spring/summer go to handbag when it
comes to just chucking everything in it
was definitely my wire sell I think this
is called the sack to Joy but I'm really
bad at design I'm back names
don't quote me I think I did or what's
in my hand my video on this bag but if
not you guys will definitely recognize
it for my Instagram for my vlogs because
I carried it with me for 80% of this
year and it's just such a versatile bag
I think I got this in the net-a-porter
sale in December 2016 and then I just
wore it from yeah basically from January
all the way through to the end of summer
when I swapped with my Kate Spade bag
that kind of became my winter chuck it
all in bag but I absolutely love these
big bags that don't have any zips or any
fastenings you just chuckle your stuff
in and then I'll often carry a smaller
handbag around with me as well which is
a little bit more chic but these kind of
bags are so so versatile I think Zara
had something similar that looked almost
identical to this in fact unknowingly a
few people thought that I had the Zara
one that sounds really bad but when you
spend three four hundred pounds on the
same the wrong one and then someone goes
oh that's the Zara bag I'm like no it's
not I'm really invested in this but
anyway if you do want to get this kind
of look then check out Zara but I have
no regrets investing in this beautiful
bag which will last me a long time from
Saint Laurent in the summer months
without a doubt my most worn shoes were
my little I like to call them I in Adams
shoes from Nicholas Kirkwood these are
looking rather battered now I wore them
so much probably my most worn shoes of
last year aside from the boots that I'm
about to mention but they are kind of
stubbed on the toes they are very well
worn on the bottom and also on this one
Dickens actually nibbled it which I was
really really upset about I also wore
these on the day that we went to
Positano and I think they had like a
year's worth of rainfall in one day so I
basically waded through water in these
shoes which is quite grim and they're
not looking too bad considering but I
have actually just ordered myself the
exact same pair again because if I wear
these shoes the same amount in 2018 as I
did last year then I'll still be really
chuffed with the price per wear
something else that I wore absolutely
loads in summer was this little skirt
from Club Monaco I actually was in the
Sloane Square store yesterday and I saw
that this is now in sale I think they
must have stored a load of summer stuff
and I've just bought it back out for
sale so if you do love this then
definitely check it out I will leave a
link down below if I can find it on the
Club Monaco website this I wore loads on
holiday loads in the UK I found the
lengths to be absolutely perfect it's
quite high-waisted it fits really
beautifully on the waist and then it
finishes maybe like a hands width above
the knee so really flattering but still
nice and feminine and flirty and then
the pom-pom details just made it really
fun so I loved where I missed throughout
the summer months and once again I'll be
wearing it this spring and summer too
also in spring/summer 2017 I wore suede
skirts a lot now this side skirt was
actually I'm featured this in my very
first a sauce haul video and this was
also the first product that I sold a lot
of so as you probably know when I leave
links down below there are affiliate
links and that means I can track them I
can see how much you guys like them I
can count how many of you guys have
bought them and this skirt was the first
thing that I sold hundreds of and it
really gave me such excitement to know
that I was inspiring so many of you to
make a purchase so this skirt has always
been quite special to me this really
good-quality one really thick suede from
ASOS and I actually bought something
similar again this year from River
Island and surf wrote a bit here I wore
that one a lot I bought a pink suede
skirt which I also wore loads and then
also a pink of corduroy skirt I wore
them absolutely loads spring summer and
autumn it's only really these last three
months and it's been too cold to wear a
skirt that I've not won them so much I'm
gonna briefly talk about a couple of
things which I don't have here because
they are actually in storage in the loft
but I will show you photos of them so
one of the dresses that I wore the most
during the summer months I actually
featured it first in my romantic
lookbook again and which I filmed around
Valentine's Day it is this beautiful
Coast dress it's got a drop hem and then
it kind of fills out at the bottom which
gives it a really beautiful feminine
style gorgeous pink color and I wore
it's quite a lot of weddings over the
summer with the Stuart Weitzman heels
die showed you a second ago it was
really my go to some occasion dress and
if I wasn't wearing that I was probably
wearing my Karen Millen broderie on bed
rest I think I first wore that dress to
Wimbledon and I just felt great in it I
felt like it was really a dress that
suited me it was a beautiful
broderie anglaise gorgeous length so
sophisticated and feminine and really
classy looking I just absolutely adored
it and I'm really excited to wear it
again
I wore it on the evening that Charlie
and I got engaged I've just realized I
took my engagement
not to do some cooking because I still
haven't had it resized it's a little bit
big and so I need to get that out of the
little pot that it's in in the kitchen
but yeah I wore it on the evening of our
engagement that was my other favorite
summer dress and then another summer
piece which I don't have here with me is
my black scalloped edge Marysia bikini
in fact I might have it my drawer hold
on I do I have it here so this is the
bikini that I wore the most this year on
holidays or if I was going to like a spa
here in the UK this bikini was expensive
I got it from net-a-porter I think at
the end of 2016 because I definitely
wore on a press trip at the end of 2016
so yeah it's quite an old one now but
it's still in stock I'm still full price
on net supporter so it's definitely a
timeless style that they are bringing
back season after season such a classic
this top works really well if you have
little or no boobs like myself it almost
acts like a crop top and then the
bottoms are incredibly flattering
incredibly comfortable they are these
they look rather ginormous but they are
really beautiful on high-waisted bottoms
because are high waisted covers your
tummy so you just feel a little bit more
confident in those just a couple of
shoes to show you before we move on to
autumn winter these are my second pair
of Valentino Rockstar shoes I bought my
first pair of Valentino rock studs my
graduation
four or five years ago and I wore them
so much they are so comfortable I feel
like they elevate so many outfits and I
wore them so so so much I would wear the
machines I would wear them to dinner
parties I'd wear them for blogging
events I wore them so much they got a
little bit battered because I wore them
so much but from afar and especially
when you're looking down on them you
really could not tell what they were
battered at all but I knew and I knew
how much I wore them so I thought that
in the spring of last year I'd invest in
a new pair my original pair are light
pink patent and I adore them and I still
wear them a lot but my new pair have
this metallic almost rose gold leather
and I think they are so stunning but
once again that they go with so many
different outfits because I think gold
is quite a neutral color it really works
no matter what color I'm wearing the
heel height is perfect gives me a great
little boost but also really really
comfortable if you're looking for a pair
of wedding shoes or bridesmaid shoes
special occasion shoes graduation shoes
or just a pair of designer
you will get a lot of use out of I could
not recommend these enough
honestly go and try a pair on auto
repair from online I think I got these
from far fetch they also come in half
sizes two and really small sizes so yeah
could not recommend these anymore from
high end to high street I also wore
these shoes so much over summer these
are some little slip-on mules from River
Island and I think they look so much
more expensive than the actual price tag
I really like the details such as well
first of all the leather they're almost
like a faux croc or snakeskin leather
absolutely beautiful got a lovely Sheen
to them I love that you just slip them
on super easy to wear and then I also
really like this gold detail on a sole
here sorry they're a little bit dirty as
I said they are very well worn but this
gold just showed ever so slightly as
you're walking and it really just gave
them a nice almost designer very luxe
looking finish to them love those one so
much with tons and tons of different
outfit combinations super comfortable
and a great pair at a great price too my
last pair of shoes that I wore
absolutely loads over the summer are my
Chloe Susannah boots these I know for
sure are in the sale at the moment in
this color so definitely check out my
link down below it is not too late to
invest in these they are such an iconic
shoe they're not going out of style any
time soon there are major classic I got
them in this brownie beige suede and I
have no regrets
I love the black but I prefer beige I
find a really versatile they look great
with bare legs I wore these quite a lot
with shorter dresses in the summer if I
was wearing like hot pants or not hot
pants up much over summer but with
skirts they looked really great my
favorite outfit probably with these was
my Topshop ditzy print floral dress I'll
leave a photo of that outfit here and
these boots just gave it a really cool
kind of boho festively vibe and they're
just so comfortable so practical and
again great price but well okay so we're
moving on to autumn winter now and I'm
really going to whiz through these
pieces because I'm sure you guys are
getting itchy feet
it's been a long video and also because
I've probably spoken about them and worn
them a lot recently as I don't want to
bore you but I whizzed through my most
worn pieces from the past few months as
well first of all this she'll a from
Reese it's in this beautiful color again
almost like that like a grey I've worn a
lot of this color this yeah this is
super snuggly it's a very luxurious
finish it makes your jumper and jeans
outfit just look so polished and it's
super
normally warm as well if you're really
chilly if it's windy you can bring this
up and it's just so snuggly around the
neck really keeps you nice and cozy and
just look how beautiful it is once again
I think reefs are repeating so I will
try and find that for you I will jump
addresses a lot this last autumn and
winter and probably my most one was this
one from a sauce I wore this with over
knee boots and a trench coat on my
Instagram for quite a lot of outfit
shoots and you guys absolutely loved it
this was also a really good value I
think this was around the 35 pound price
mark and it does contain cashmere too so
as you can imagine super supersoft is
quite okay I've just realized this is
actually the jumper and not the jumper
dress I will talk about this in a second
this is the jumper dress that I thought
I was holding but really nice length it
just slightly flares out at the bottom I
will insert a photo of me wearing it
here so you can get a better idea
slightly thinner material so you can
wear this with tights and a thermal
underneath too but just such a versatile
color really flattering on all different
skin tones and a piece that was so easy
to wear I knew that this with the G lay
or coat and over knee boots of just look
amazing so I found myself reaching for
that out for combinations so much in
autumn winter so the jumper that I
thought was the jumper dress this is a
cashmere jumper from a sauce little bit
thicker material than the jumper dress
nice lovely hyper leo neck which made it
super snuggly I did want to gain weather
so the thermal underneath thermals are
probably my most one thing of the autumn
winter months as you guys know but again
this beautiful color this kind of
oatmeal so flattering a nice shape there
is nothing terribly special about this
jumper but a really really classic piece
I now call this my Megan Markel coat
because it looks so similar to the one
that she wore when they announced their
engagement and did their first public
outing but this is my river island coat
that I have worn non-stop for the past
two or three months it does have this
detachable faux fur looks even more like
the mech and Markel coats when you take
the fur away River island under 100
pounds really good value looks so much
more expensive than it actually was
super feminine and flattering when you
tie it in the waist too and whenever I
wear this people always compliment me
which always makes you feel good about
what you're wearing this I think is
still in stock so highly highly
recommend picking this one up if you
haven't already bought it if you did buy
this or any of these pieces based on my
recommendations throughout the year
please let me know in the comments below
because I think it's so so interesting
I'd love to know when I inspire you and
also don't forget that on Instagram you
can use the hashtag hashtag fashion
tumblr made me buy it when you wear
things that you have bought because
you've seen me wearing them or you've
seen me recommend them and I'll often do
shoutouts on my Instagram stories are my
favorites so yeah if you've been
inspired by any of these pieces or any
of the things I wore last year that
definitely let me know a trend that I
absolutely love I loved so much last
year and I still love now is the pie
crust collar detail on polo necks I have
a caramel and jumper quite similar to
this one without the metallic thread and
I just bought something new from Monika
again you'll see that in my sale haul
coming very soon but this one from Ted
Baker I would say it's my most worn polo
neck top of 2017 oh no next of course
are super super warm great for layering
and because this one has a scoreless
frill detail with a pink metallic thread
running through it I think is so so
pretty I'm sure lots of you would have
predicted seeing these in this video
they are my Karen Millen over-the-knee
boots probably my well definitely my
most worn Footwear from autumn and
winter
I think 99% of my recent outfit posts
have featured these because I just wear
them with everything I wear them with
jeans with skirts with tights so so so
much I think that skirts or jumper
dresses with over knee boots really was
my go-to style at the end of last year
and already this year as well so yeah
you've heard me talking about these
loads I won't go on too much other than
to say I absolutely love them and this
looms dog so get yourself a pair another
jumper dress this one is from River
Island again in that beautiful
oatmeal color it has got that balloon
style sleeve which I absolutely love
nice high neck great for wearing
thermals underneath really affordable
really soft again great with over knee
boots so I wore this one loads and loads
probably my second most worn jumper
dress of 2017 I have mag mentioned this
is my Gucci chevron print mom on a
handbag I think it's Marmont or the mini
Marmont this one you may not have seen
me wearing
loads and loads on my Instagram or in my
blog but I find this bag so practical
and I do use it absolutely tons this
sounds kind of dorky but if I'm just
going to the supermarket or if I'm
taking the dogs for a walk
this is what I will put on over the
shoulder crossbody put the dog poo bags
in there put my person there put my
phone in there such a great size and
I use this so so so much it's got a cute
little heart on the back I actually need
to wear this more out and about because
it's such a lovely style and they
brought it back this season as well so
definitely a really good investment
piece we're down to the final three hang
on there if you're still watching I have
worn this jumper from Reese so much over
the past few months I also wore it in
spring time on his chillier mornings
it's a beautiful shape really nice
dipped hem so you've got this lighter
color on the inside which you can see if
you roll down the collar or roll up the
sleeves a little bit just a really
classic jumper beautiful quality looks
really luxurious when you're wearing it
so because it was so classic I got tons
of wear out of this last year I feel
like in winter we all have a go to polo
neck or Roll neck and for me this one
from Club Monaco was exactly that it is
cashmere as well so it's super super
soft
it looks quite white on the camera but
it is actually a really beautiful light
gray despite the fact that this is well
over 18 months old it hasn't bobbled
which is the true sign of good quality
cashmere I would always recommend
getting cashmere from Club Monaco I've
never been disappointed with their
jumpers and I did buy a few more
cashmere jumpers again in their sale
keep a lookout for that sale video and
definitely check out Keiko story if you
live near one because their cells are
amazing it definitely the right time to
buy cashmere but this Rolo neck was just
super scrumptious and I wore this loads
throughout the winter months and last
but not least and this feels like a bit
of a cheat because I only got this at
the end of 2017 but I've been wearing it
so much in early 2018 that I had to
mention it it is this beautiful polo
neck or roll neck I never know what to
call them from Topshop it's a really
really beautiful snuggly material super
affordable gorgeous high neckline keeps
you so cozy and warm and then a very
slight balloon sleeve not too
exaggerated but I just love this jumper
so much it's already one of my most worn
jumpers of winter so I thought I would
stick this one in for good measure as
well so just to whiz through at the
jewellery I would say in the summer my
most worn jewelry piece was my mazuma
London horn necklace this one here I'm
sure you guys have seen it on many many
bloggers for good reason it makes your
outfits just look super chic it's a real
statement piece now it's the UC Williams
for mazuma horn necklace looks really
good with this top as well I feel super
naked without my engagement ring but I
just want to show you my favorite rings
of the year this one is from aster denim
you you
probably seen me wearing this a million
times and then also this one I'll just
show you on this finger will this one so
much this year as well they look really
really beautiful stacked also I wear
them with my engagement ring as well as
my MS ohm and London necklace I also
wore this warrant loads especially
throughout the beginning of the year
this is from Pandora it's as beautiful
little crystals on a chain necklace
looks so gorgeous especially over the
top of plain jumpers such as this one
so you've got the little diamante
crystals on one side and on the other
side it is plain so you can really
switch it up depending on how you want
to wear it
of course my Michael Kors access which
ever since I collaborated with them
which I think started in October this
has been my everyday watch you guys know
how much I love this so definitely had
to include this in my 2017 about say
fashion favorites they kind of are my
fashion favorites but my most worn of
last year and last but not least my two
most worn bracelets are these two from
Monaco Vanita so we have my signature
bangle in rose gold this is the medium
thickness I get quite a lot of questions
about the thickness because there are a
few different types you can get I have
the medium thickness in rose gold they
are so good for personalization and I
think this design is so stunning so
classic I wrote an entire blog post
about why it's such a good investment
piece so I'll leave that blog post
linked down below and then this one I
think is called the linear bracelet you
guys all know the story about how I used
the secret involving this bracelet to
get a hundred thousand subscribers so
it's very very special to me and almost
every single day of 2017
I wore this bracelet so those have been
my most worn at jewelry pieces of the
last year so those are my 2017 most worn
favorite fashion pieces slash best
purchases I really hope you guys enjoyed
