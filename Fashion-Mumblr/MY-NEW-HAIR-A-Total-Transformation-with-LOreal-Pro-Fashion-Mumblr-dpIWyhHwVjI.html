past 8:00 on a Sunday morning and I'm up
dressed normally I would still be in bed
by now but I've been waking up really
early these past few days I don't know
if I can now suddenly got my jet lag
from the US but actually I'm making it
work in my favor and I'm trying to be
really productive in the mornings I
actually really like working super early
on a weekday it's like my peaceful time
before the emails start coming in so
yeah thank the Lord for being an early
riser but anyway today I edited my
entire New York video which hopefully if
all goes to plan you guys would have
seen it last night
I just took loads of different clips
while we're out there and decided to put
them all together in writer mini guide
to New York so hopefully you'll have
enjoyed it and watched it and I was also
thinking I might do something like that
for London so let me ask that something
you'd like to see because I do get quite
a lot of emails from some of you guys
asking for recommendations for London
and I feel like I have a lot of cool
breakfast places and photo hotspots
things like that so let me know if you
like seeing London one so today the main
reason why I'm up and dressed affliction
just Heidi dis rumours it feels so nice
to have a tidy house for one and what
was I saying
haven't I my coffee is mine yeah so the
reason why I'm up super early this
morning is because I actually have a car
outside now it would consider leaving 15
minutes early but I am ready the guys -
chat to you guys first today I'm heading
to the L'Oreal head offices for a hair
makeover and they're going to be doing
some incredible all-over color on my
hair is called platen nude I'm going to
take you guys along with me so you can
see the whole process and I think it's
going to really firm an interesting day
because it's called a Content day I
think this is how big brands enormous
you to have this amazing high-quality
content on their Instagram and read
professional photos and videos today is
the kind of day where they're creating
all that contents I think the marketing
teams will be there the PR teams and a
few other bloggers so organ we creating
where the content should be really
interesting and hopefully quite fun blog
and then this afternoon Charlie's family
coming over and my mum can have a nice
barbecue so fingers crossed
it stays like this blue skies so that's
done for today
I feel really rude leaving my driver
waiting even though it's early so I'm
going to get going out for you that
world's quickest outfit of the day just
wearing my little Tsar address which
minimum from Isaiah Hall this is my Rees
suede jacket and many cliff cut wood
slats and I'm also taking on the back of
the door for a couple of spare tops just
because when you're doing photos it's
nice to have options
all right I'm here and the Loreal had
offices such cool offices this space
around me is kind of fair Judeo rush
Academy area so I'm very lucky to kind
of get a sneak peek at the offices
I've just had to go into a photo studio
room take something for shop and I'll
show you guys exactly basically and you
know I have a happy little while ago so
my roots are pretty bad so unflattering
and now I had it highlighted at for
Edmund which I love the minute a lot of
stuff and I still have this major brew
system going on what they're going to do
is refresh my whole hair make me a lot
blonder I'm going for a platinum from
you in color I throw this to music every
now it's probably can't hear me very
well but you know what's happening I
just met a hairdresser who's amazingly
comfortable frequency so excited to get
started with a makeover
okay so excuse my scary hairstyle but
they as I mentioned earlier I'm going to
the shop in news which is basically a
soft and wearable platinum which found
exactly of my Street and the girls lips
in my hair and because I have such
making sure roots going on that was very
unflattering we're going to get all over
color again really lift it up and it
will see a big difference afterwards so
for
got my leech in I've gotta wait another
ten minutes to get it off not gonna lie
I am going to get another thing because
Cuba D I washed my hair yesterday so if
you forgot a number one rule of getting
your hapless which is don't wash it they
before it makes them sculpt a little bit
more itchy so applying it to reserve the
oats of crash sonic spices get efficient
and okay I'm back out here again is this
like an item in their music so loud
sunglass do you think it's called a
second time I have got my hair covered
him smartphone now spoken about smart
long before but basically it's a
treatment you can put it in your hair
color in the hair coming up and this is
two separate vessel basically it really
helps the condition of your hair make it
nice and healthy which the blonde is so
important so I had a song about 10
minutes the color looking good so the
trim self and I'm excited to see the
final
I can feel the smooth with them make a
bear man change man change way I've seen
man or sleep inside of the road with a
smile upon laughing I heard oh man sing
will you to know
Oh sound braggy we are so nearly done
I'm just setting like hell cool down and
ass up in this life I promise you it's
not purple it's pretty crystal champagne
color and now they're three different
Britain's own to create content so as a
video group a closer room and in the
room are the flowering room so while my
toes cool down let's color tabletop and
I'm not sure how much you can hang up it
isn't like a clause in here as I said
earlier I like a little bit oh my
goodness I will not with it I need my
hat say I love the style I think I'm
going to get 20 of the professional
photos because it's just so I can share
session

I didn't vlog any of it but we had
Charlie's family and my mum over for
lucky barbecue and we just outside
