thought I would share with you my post
gym beauty routine in today's video I'm
going to be using lots of new products
this is this month tea box from QVC
Chile being try it love it and inside
each month is always a really lovely
selection of new products things which
are new discoveries a beautifully
curated selection of products so I'm
going to use a lot of these pieces this
morning to cleanse shower very important
Christian and then do my makeup so let's
get started so this month I'm pleased to
see a few of my existing favorites in
here including the little penguin polish
so this is what I'm going to start with
there's also some things in here that
I've not tried before which is why I
love beauty boxes I've heard this from
before it's alpha H this is that liquid
rose gold a limited edition from really
started to give this a go I think we'll
use that after cleansing also a kind of
impulse and essential for this our fans
and you've also got new launches in here
this is the beauty live rather 10-minute
time you guys know how much I love each
Liberata I've not tried the 10 minute
pan yet so this is a really nice way of
me discovering product before maybe
making that purchase decision whether to
buy the full size or not and then
shampoo and conditioner this could not
be more perfect for my protein routine
this brand I like because it's got my
initials jf but it's actually Julianne
Ferrell anti-aging for your hair and I
feel like that can be pretty good for my
bleached hair at the moment because
bleaching is pretty much the ultimate
way to age your hair so this should be
really good for my hair condition right
now there's also a little sample of the
it cosmetics your skin's are better CC
cream so equal message is a brand you
can get on QVC which is both nipple
books but I've not tried any of their CC
creams before I've tried their concealer
which I love so this is really handy
kind of trouble sized sample which I'll
have try later on it's also an OPI nail
polish such a classic gray shade I just
have any green operation so that's a
really nice one too
selection another favorite of mine this
is benefit roller lash
I love these comeback sized ones I find
that sometimes my makeups need to
topping up in the middle of the day so
nice to carry on a thief in my handbag
and anti-aging this is very anti aging
rocks all the transforms of face this is
from a brand I think the brand is ultra
sons who is made or in a good sign and
this is SPF 30 they're really good to
keep skin protective when we do
hallelujah have a nice bright sunny days
but it always be protect this and then
this is something really new to have not
seen this before a brand called Elmo
loves glow apologies if I said that
wrong this is a sensitive cleansing oil
and a little bar of soap really tiny and
I'm definitely gonna pop these straight
in my travel bag to my upcoming trips so
all together I was saying that that's
probably at least 50 pounds worth if not
more of products but the box itself is
only 20 pounds so not only and you're
going to discover a lot of new things
but also saving a pretty penny too so I
don't wear a ton of makeup in the gym
but today for example I was filming a
little bit in there so I do the most put
on a little bit of light coverage like a
CC cream and I did put some brow
products into because that never hurt
but this you can use on your skin when
you've got a full face of makeup or just
to cleanse already keen skin and start
applying my little toes and polish those
travels buys one is definitely going to
go in my gym bag after today because
this is such a handy size and I can use
in shower after gym
before I do get in the shower I am going
to put some of this on my face my body
is actually fairly bronzed at the moment
but I've just read that you can put this
on the face and we try that and then
wash it off in the shower
ten minutes later right so it says to
leave this on for 10 minutes so I'm
going to go and get rid of the shower
and I'll see you at work okay so I'm out
of the shower feeling such as a daisy
and I'm going to do my makeup now so
luckily today I'm just working from home
so the products in the box are going to
be really perfect for that very nude
natural your skin the better look I'm
going to start by trying out this ultra
some professional protection face cream
so as I mentioned it's SPF 30 some
protection for very sensitive skin I
think to be honest because it's a 30 and
it is a specific SPF you could use this
on holiday but again it's really good to
just either when you're in the UK a
little sore the tab on this one but even
in the UK it's so important to have an
SPF on your face at all times because
even if it doesn't feel hot and sunny
the sun's rays can still potentially be
a little bit damaging I'm going to start
by just putting this all over my face
getting YouTube you deal with us alright
so that's all sunk in and unlike a lot
of Sun creams that actually has left my
skin not feeling tacky it feels as
though I can put makeup on straightaway
which is great because I'm going to try
the it cosmetics CC cream from the box
next so on the back of this one it says
developed with plastic surgeons and
dermatologists applied to appetite clean
skin can be used as your moisturiser
anti-aging serum concealer foundation
and protective shields so this is like
the ultimate multitasking product again
this is one I'm just going to pop in my
gym bag because sometimes I do actually
do all of this when I'm actually in the
gym normally because I just prefer the
showered moon gym sometimes I have a
meeting straight afterwards so it's nice
to
things like this especially multitasking
products in the gym bag I'm just going
to use a buffing brush to blend that one
in so this is just given my skin a
really lovely very light coverage but to
be honest on days like today
all I really need and it's really
helping to boost that post chairman glow
so I don't feel like I need any more
coverage than this to bring some color
in I'm just going to use one of my
current favorite bronzers taking that on
a big Brush and then as always I'm just
applying it where the Sun would
naturally hit my skin so on the top here
down on the bridge of my nose under the
cheekbone just to add a little bit of
shape and then the final thing that I
need to make me feel human is some
mascara I've tried and loved benefit
roller lash so many times before this is
a really handy travel size what I love
about this one is you don't need eyelash
curlers which is fantastic it really
does have these little grips on it which
hook into the eyelashes and give you
that beautiful lift without the need for
colors so once again great from the go
great for in your gym bag handbag travel
bag etc so you can see that after just a
few seconds of mascara application it's
really opened up the eyes and has such
tamasic effect considering is just a
couple of strokes of mascara so I'm
happy with how my makeup is and trends I
don't need to do any more on days like
today when as I said just working from
home so what I love about this box is
that there's so many products in here
that are either existing favourite or
brand-new pieces that I've not tried
before a really nice way to introduce
yourself in your brows on these all the
information for the tea box down below
definitely check it out you can now I
think it's time that I made myself a
scrumptious and nutritious post
Jayla snack so let me show you what I
like to prepare for myself after workout
so I'm heading into the kitchen and you
guys have actually seen this recipe
before I'm using a Madeleine chilled
cookbook to create her vegan pancakes
these are such an easy and bring you
Trish's breakfast and I find them really
filling so it's definitely something
that I'm craving after a workout really
easy I'm just sticking some bananas and
oats with some cinnamon
into my Thermomix moving it all up and
then I'm adding your name my almond milk
and a few drops of vanilla in the pan on
the hob I'm putting some coconut oil and
then actually I use a little bit too
much this time then I'm just assuming
the mixture in and cooking it it really
is as easy as that
this mixture and creates about four
pancakes
nice thick one so you can let those cook
for a few moments
for the topping I would usually make
like a strawberry compote but I'm all
out of strawberries today so I'm
chopping up even more banana and then
I'm going to add some maple syrup I
definitely deserve it after that workout
some blueberries and also some almonds
just to finish it off and then because
this is a working day I'm taking that
through to the lounge
and I'm just going to eat my healthy
pancakes while catching up on a few
email next I'm heading back into the
kitchen and Charlie actually made the
juice while I was out this morning and
thank you very much darling so I'm just
going to enjoy that while I carry on
with work and I will get dressed at some
point but that's it for me that's mine
so you guys enjoyed space video and I've
given it fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
