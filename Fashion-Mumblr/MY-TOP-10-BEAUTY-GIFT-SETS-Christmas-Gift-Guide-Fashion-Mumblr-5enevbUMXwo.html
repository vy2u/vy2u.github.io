joining me for today's video it's going
to be my first christmas gift guide
video i have even put a Christmas tree
in the background of this video to make
it a little bit more festive and I'm
going to be talking about my favorite
for UT gifts this year there are so many
beauty box sets gift sets and loads of
incredible gift ideas on the market so I
thought I would round up my top 10 and
hopefully it'll be really useful for you
if you're thinking of buying someone
that you love a beauty gift this
Christmas alright so I'm going to get
straight sticking that with my first
gift and this one is something a little
bit different it's my brand called the
beauty kitchen and it's the invent your
own beauty products kit I think this is
a really lovely idea it's something very
unusual compared to the majority of
beauty gift sets out there and this one
is also all-natural so perhaps if you've
got any friends that really like to use
natural makeup products perhaps you've
got a friend that's pregnant and then
they want to be starting to look into
natural beauty then this is a really
good set to do so obviously because
you're making everything yourself you're
mixing together your moisturizers or
cleansers that kind of thing you know
exactly what's going into it so it
doesn't proud you to go into your own
kitchen and mix in a few of the products
you'll find in your cupboards which is
just a really lovely idea what's great
about this is that you can really tailor
it to your skin type as well so say you
want to find something really nourishing
then you can mix the ingredients within
this with some honey for example which
you might have in your fridge and that
will give you a really lovely nourishing
face mask so a great way to blend your
own beauty products and something really
fun that to give to someone at this
Christmas next is a gift set from one of
my all-time favorite skincare brands and
it is in this aisle this is the one of a
kind
radiance gift set a really lovely size a
nice easy one to wrap up as well which
is something I always consider and then
inside you've got a couple of the
classical is our products so really
great one to give to someone if you know
someone that is a big fan of cleanse and
polish or you've got a full size cleanse
and polish and the cleansing cloth you
also have a mini of the instant boost
skin tonic and the face serum so perhaps
if you know someone that's already a
really big fan of cleanse and polish and
they want to explore a bit more of the
new self collection then this would be a
really good way of them to do so or
maybe you are like me and you're the one
friend that is always saying it's your
friends that they need to try cleanse
and polish and yet they still haven't
this would be a really nice way of
introducing them to the brand
the products that they will rave about
for many years after trying this so yeah
a really lovely way to give someone some
of this Elvis Christmas next up and I
feel like this is such a classic and
there is nothing better than undoing
your Christmas wrapping or Christmas
morning and seeing this box underneath
your Christmas tree it is of course Joey
Malone and Joe Malone is just a failsafe
go-to brand when it comes to gifting
whether that's Christmas or birthdays or
just any time you want to give someone a
little extra treat so inside the boxes
of course you can fill it with anything
you like perhaps you know someone it's
got a favorite fragrance maybe they love
wearing pomegranate and wild perfume and
you want to give them the candle or you
want to let them try something new you
can just mix and match the products you
put in here of course gem alone not only
have candles and perfumes but body
washes body scrubs etc etc inside this
gift box all right I've got the orange
blossom body creme so this is a really
lovely pampering product it's one step
up from our body lotion so very nice and
nourishing for the skin during those
colder winter months and then also a
mimosa and cardamom candle this is
actually something I've not tried before
this was a gift to me my birthday from
german-owned so I'm very grateful to
have received a new candle these also
make the most amazing housewarming
presents I feel like at Christmas if
you've just bought a new house or if you
are buying a new house or moving into
some I knew then buying someone a German
candle is such a lovely luxurious treat
at Christmas next up is another brands
that I really associate with Christmas
and unboxing under the Christmas tree
and it is soap &amp;amp; Glory my mum always
chooses some soap &amp;amp; Glory pieces my
stocking at Christmas and this year they
have so many like so so many amazing
gift sets
mostly you can get them from boots I
think sometimes they're even in the
three for two offers so keep a lookout
for that this one that I've chosen is
the global now having said what I said
about the Liz Earle box this is not
going to be an easy one to wrap I would
probably put this in the gift bag and
just put some tissue paper on the top
because otherwise yeah might be quiet
might cut charge you want to wrap up but
inside here let me open it up and show
you it is obviously like a giant bauble
you would probably think that someone
had bought you a football if you
all wrapped up under the tree but in
here you have loads of iconic soap and
great products so a I never know what to
call these are they a loofah or a bath
proof thing this is the famous bath and
shower body wash this smells absolutely
incredible really good size and I find
this very nourishing and like
moisturizing on the skin too then you
have got to be smoothie this is their
body cream body butter really good size
if you know anyone that's going away
perhaps you've got some friends of going
skiing or going on holiday in the new
year that's a really good little at
travel size also in the smaller size is
their breakfast scrub this is another
favorite product of mine really good for
removing fake tan so a really fun and
very useful gift set from soap &amp;amp; Glory
again a really nice way of discovering
the products perhaps you've not tried
their body scrub before then chances are
aren't using this you will become
addicted by really nice way of
introducing someone to the soap &amp;amp; Glory
brand so this was beautifully wrapped up
with the ribbon but unfortunately
Dickens got to it before I could show
you but my next gift suggestion is of
course a perfume and what better perfume
to gift then at one of my all-time
favorites which is flower bomb so this
is a really lovely special edition I
think this one is available exclusively
at the perfume shop it is a frosted
glass bottle which just looks absolutely
stunning and then you've got this
metallic almost like a rosette flower on
the top if you know someone that is
already a fan of Flowerbomb then this is
a really nice way to gift it to them in
a slightly more special packaging you
can also get the bottles engraved and
they come in the most amazing gift box
of tissue paper and then Flowerbomb bag
so you really do get that full
experience when you're gifting someone
Flowerbomb this Christmas if you do know
someone that is a huge huge fan of the
fragrance and as well as the perfume
they also release their candle this year
I've got a couple in my bedroom upstairs
and without even lighting them they make
the whole room smell absolutely
incredible so perhaps if you want to buy
something that's a little bit different
to perfume and I highly recommend the
candle as well this next one is a real
treat and is a gift set from Dolphin now
Dolphin is one of my all-time favorite
skincare brands I love so many of their
products especially their oils and I
think that because it is a slightly more
premium price point it's a lovely one to
receive at Christmas as a way of
discovering the brand
perhaps the first time or trying out a
few new products within the range this
is their luscious plumped skin set
inside here you've got their cleansing
foam gel aromatic renewing balm and that
itself is one of the most luxurious
pampering products I have ever tried so
whoever you give this to will be very
very grateful to you I've discovered
that you also have the skin hydrating
cream gel tangerine aromatic care which
i think is a little oil which is again
such a heavenly product these oils are
so lovely to use in the evening I like
to warm them between my hands and then
inhale and then apply it to my face also
lovely wants to take on airplanes with
you I think this is a really good size
for popping in a travel bag and then you
also have the Kiwi hydrating face mask
in here which is a great one again for
winter skin that just needs a little
boost of hydration if you don't want to
give someone products this Christmas
perhaps you think they'd rather have an
experience then I always say to anyone
that asks that my favorite facial that I
have ever had is a darn facial so that
would be a really lovely thing to give
to someone perhaps you know someone
whose voice is super busy and hasn't
really made enough time for themselves
lately perhaps giving them a voucher for
a diaphragm facial would be a really
really nice idea I will leave all the
information about dolphin facials in the
description box so that you know the
best places to book as well now I don't
know about you but I would be very very
excited if I saw this iconic packaging
underneath my Christmas tree this year
it is of course Charlotte Tilbury this
is the beauty icons gift set and I feel
like whether you know someone that
already has practically everything from
the Charlotte Tilbury range or perhaps
they've been lusting over something from
the brand for quite a long time this
would just be a perfect perfect
Christmas gift
so in here you have as you can imagine
the most iconic products from the range
a few of my all-time favorites you get
the magic cream a really nice size
actually and you don't need that much
when you apply it so this size it should
actually last a really long time also
inside you get a little tiny very cute
handbag size lipstick this one is in
their shade bitch please which is an
iconic nude color this with a slightly
deeper colored lip liner is just such a
classic
and one of the most popular ones from
Charlotte Tilbury this would be very
easy to lose so keep that one in a safe
place tiny tiny little lipstick you've
also got the instant soft focus Beauty
flash this is something I've not tried
before so I'll definitely let you know
how I get along with this one think you
applied that before your makeup the
mascara and then also the lip cheat in
pillow talk which is probably one of the
most famous charlotte toby products out
there or my personal favorite products
from the whole range all of which come
in this gorgeous gift set so I think
this is a really really nice Christmas
gift idea to treat someone who loves a
Charlotte Tilbury my next one is from
aromatherapy associates this brand has
so many products for that person that
maybe is just a little bit too busy a
bit too stressed and needs to invest in
some me time this is the time to sleep
gift set I think we all know someone
that struggles we're going to sleep at
night or really needs a few lovely
products to help them at doze off in the
evenings and this is exactly that so let
me show you how it looks inside I think
the packaging of this box is just
absolutely beautiful
everything is so gorgeously presented
you have got the deep relaxed bath and
shower oil I took one of these two so
her farmhouse a couple of weeks ago and
I only put a few drops in the bath and
the whole room smelt absent incredible
for a whole day afterwards so the scent
on this one is amazing and very very
strong to continue the luxurious
experience after your bath there's also
the body oil which has an equally
luxurious fragrance which really does
helped calm me down chew you out and
hopefully get you into that cozy and
dozy mood ready for sleep and finally
this little roll-on this one also has
the sandalwood and vetiver fragrances in
there which are very good at helping to
calm the mind this one you would apply
on your pulse point it's really great
again to take with you on your
travelling perhaps if you struggle to
get some rest when you're in hotel rooms
or you want to be able to drift off on
an airplane this is a really handy size
to do so hopefully this will encourage
the lucky recipient to just take a few
moments to take a few deep breaths chill
them out if you know someone that's got
a very hectic and busy job and you think
they need a bit of me time then this
would be a really lovely thing to give
to them another brand that is doing some
incredible gift sets this year
is L'Occitane and this is my personal
favorite one that I would definitely be
gifting to my mom home plate she's not
watching this video but this is full of
so many amazing products I think you can
go to the lock stance tools and you can
just pick a mix into beautiful gift
boxes but this one has come with a
selection of iconic locks Tanit products
so inside as you can see the products
all of which are full-size which is very
very generous
you have got firstly the shower oil this
is one that I love to take with me when
I'm traveling when I go on holiday
because it's so hydrating and nourishing
to the skin I like to use this with
exfoliating gloves because it kind of
combats the drying effect of exfoliating
because it's just so nourishing we've
got a L'Occitane hand cream and who
doesn't love lots ton hand cream they
smell amazing they're very very
hydrating great for this time of year
this next one is the lavender bath foam
as you can imagine it makes your bath
smell up so you heavenly it so again a
really good one for a good night's sleep
and then for fans of the hand cream this
is an even bigger version of the hand
cream so I would say that this is a
really nice one to pop in a handbag and
then this one could be great one to
leave in the kitchen or by the side of
your bed on bedside table so a really
nice generous and selection of hand
creams also in this set you have got the
almond milk concentrate body lotion this
one is for 48 hours hydration and it
really does keep your skin hydrated for
so long I use this a lot on my summer
holidays this year and also if you know
someone that loves the fragrance of
almonds it reminds me of marzipan so so
lovely and that's a really nice one and
last but not least and this one many of
that year tear de Lumiere o depart from
this will forever remind me of our trips
and Maldives in March because I wore
this throughout that holiday it's such a
lovely fragrance very warming a great
one for summer but also because it is so
warming I'd say really nice one for this
time of year too so all of those pieces
come beautifully presented in this
gorgeous gift box which would definitely
be kept for a long time I'm sure my mum
will keep lots of little knickknacks in
here but yeah really lovely gifts that
idea from like Stamp and last but not
least and the biggest this is a lovely
gift set for the happy Buddha collection
from rituals and it comes
amazing box which once again will no
doubt be kept all keepsakes inside we
have a very generous selection of
products if you know someone that is
already a fan of the happy Buddha range
then this of course is an amazing gift
idea but equally a really nice way to
introduce someone to the incredible
products that rituals have their body
scrubs are absolute incredible very very
greeny so once again that grateful
preparing the skin for Sun or getting
rid of any dry skin in winter then
you've got the body cream and this
leaves the skin smelling so good for
hours and hours afterwards there's a
couple of products here that I've not
tried before this is an interior perfume
which i think is a really good idea
especially if you know someone who's got
dogs don't know if they'd be offended by
that I don't think so I'd love to be
gifted mint area perfume and it's a
really good size
and this I think is a body mist so it's
not quite as strong as a perfume but a
nice way to get that scent on the body
and then finally these are products that
absolutely love from rituals they are
their bath and shower foams I find them
really great for shaving with and again
they just smell amazing and they're
really fun to use in the shower
so these are all the lovely Buddha sent
from rituals in this beautiful gift box
set so those are my top ten and beauty
gifts for 2017 this Christmas I hope you
