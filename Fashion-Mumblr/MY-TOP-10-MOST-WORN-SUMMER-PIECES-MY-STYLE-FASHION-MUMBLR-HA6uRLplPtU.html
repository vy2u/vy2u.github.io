going to be another fashion video and I
know I have a lot of fashion videos on
my channel and I thought that will be
quite interesting
I'm specially useful would be to share
with you my top 10 most worn outside
pieces so you guys have seen tons of
haul tons of look books and all that
kind of stuff but these are 10 pieces
that I keep going back to time after
time after time a lot of these will come
as no surprise if you can find them
Instagram or I've seen my previous
videos you'll probably be quite familiar
with these pieces but either way I'm
just going to pull together
top 10 most worn and also the end of
this video
stick around because I'm going to be
giving away one of my most fun pieces
not leave that ones are weird especially
as they're very worn and I will be doing
a giveaway at the end of the video so
stay tuned for that and if you like
these kinds of videos don't forget to
give it a thumbs up and subscribe for
more
so my first most one-piece this summer
you may recognize if you followed my
Instagram stories or my lip book or my
Instagram in general while I was in
presence because I pretty much wore this
non-stop it is the pixie dress from
Topshop I saw this on hang out in New
York some circus store and sell another
it straight away it is a full-length
maxi dress which is kind of t-shirt
style sleeve I just absolutely love
these shown at the top here very nice
and fitted around the bodice and they
look who floats down it is a beautiful
very lightweight cotton material making
it perfect for wearing on summer
holidays but when the Sun comes back out
here in the UK i will continue wearing
it here as well but because I wore it so
often on holiday I just had to include
it in my style top ten number two is a
swimming costume and I'm not sure I've
actually featured this one on my youtube
before and actually maybe in my visa
outfit drives video this is a swimming
costume and I can't actually bring
myself to tell you how much it was
because it was excruciatingly ly
expensive but I wrote a blog post last
summer about why I do really believe in
investing in somewhere for me it just
gives me so much more confidence on the
beach when I'm wearing something that I
absolutely love and I'm totally so in
costume kinda girl I like either
high-waisted bikini bottoms or full-on
swimming costumes but for me this year I
just absolutely loved wearing this
all great mine where even if I have had
a massive bowl of pasta for lunch I
still feel good in this and just love
the colors it's not white or blush pink
so I different summer pattern back to
that and you both have this little and
stud detail around the neckline which I
think gives a really high-end feel to it
I will leave a link to it down below and
so if you're interested you can go see
how much it was but erm yeah I just
can't find one of the benefits to me
filming this video now is that a few of
these pieces are actually in the sale
this one is sixty pounds off at the
moment but that does mean that only a
few sizes left so definitely don't hang
around if you also like this dress you
may have seen this one in my Instagram
guys to London in a few blog post and
again you leave my Instagram I
absolutely adore this dress it's just so
me in style this broidery Anglais
material and then it's basically tied to
the toilet and then kicks out a little
bit in almost like a fishtail at the
bottom I just adored this in a voiceover
so much it was an investment piece but
because of the amount of use I've got
for it I find that it's been fantastic
price per wear and I have absolutely no
regrets as pizza-pie absolutely adore it
next up is a pair of shoes and I have
worn needs so so much it's almost a
little bit grossly strategies because
they are very well worn
going to be a quick Sacha powerwall now
these are from River Island they were I
think 49 pounds and I just checked them
before filming this video and they still
have every single size in stock I was
fully expecting these to be sold out
they're incredibly versatile because
they're white and they have a really
good heel height they just seem to
elevate so many different kinds of
outfits from jeans to dresses to shorts
you name it they just work wonderfully
with all my summer wardrobe I really
love this metal detail I think it makes
it look a little bit more high-end a
little bit more expensive and incredibly
comfortable it's a super versatile so no
surprise that I bought them so much they
were pair of shoes that when I saw them
I knew I wear them happily tons every
time I try and buy pair of sandals like
this and yeah definitely recommend
getting these and I've seen actually a
lot of you guys wearing them and tacking
them in your Instagram photos and by the
way if you ever do that with our new
hashtag hashtag - remember made me buy
it but if you buy anything based on some
you've seen these videos then definitely
use that hashtag on Instagram
I just love seeing all the bits and bobs
and how you guys are starting them so
that's my first accessory top 10 keys
and my second accessory most one piece
has been my rustling Bromley's Stuart
Weitzman oops so of course I do actually
have the US and Romney versions of these
but there are over 300 pounds and when I
saw these Jews I just had to get them
these are from chien so I actually have
a pair here from public desire which has
$29.99 and because I know a lot of you
guys aren't too sure about the customs
on Sheehan personally I've never had any
problems with their customs but if you'd
rather buy from a different retailer
then I highly recommend these ones so
well you can see the Pearl detail is
across the toe it's on the heel I think
this design looks so stylish so elegant
and let's get a really easy way to
update pair jeans and because they are
in neutral color just so easy to work in
which order another of my top 10 and
most one summer pieces is this dress
from Urban Outfitters I actually saw a
few other bloggers wearing this I was
inspired by the bloggers to pick this up
and I keep seeing it everywhere with no
surprise because it is so wearable this
is the kind of piece that you're very
thankful to have in your wardrobe
because you have to think about the rest
of your outfit when you wear this it is
the whole outfit in one you can wear
with so many different types of shoes
I've seen people wearing this with
Converse up not my style but it did look
really cool on them the shoes that I
showed you earlier both of those two
pairs look fabulous with this I've worn
it with gladiator sandals even smarter
shoes just find it so so versatile I
wore this a lot in Provence so if you
guys not seen in microphones lookbook I
will leave that on the screen and also
in the description box down below so
check that out but highly recommend
picking up this if you just love to have
those things in your wardrobe they're
almost mindless decisions you just put
on and no you look great
next up are two skirts which you may
recognize if you're following my
channels around early summer late spring
because I wore these two so so so much
they're both from River Island a woman
tons of the beginning of summer and then
kind of forgot about them but now that
it's approaching autumn I feel like I
will definitely start getting a lot more
out where okay so they will start to get
a lot more wear out of these especially
this one I think this is probably not
or kind of dusty pink color and
knowingly both of these are sold out I'm
so sorry but I will try and find some
similar ones down below and I'm pretty
sure that River Island will release from
more food skirts or autumn because our
films just still against the trend
that's going to come back again so
wherever I find I will leave links down
below the beauties were so well with
white sub t-shirt with blouse yeah
fabulous pieces and very affordable as
well
before I forget I also want to talk
about some jewelry that I have worn so
much over summer you guys will not be
surprised to hear that it is this ring
this is one from Africa Mew it's very
affordable for how good quality it is I
wear this all day every day I don't take
it off on a shower I don't figure out
when I wash my hands and it's still the
same color Ottoman caught it and also
these delicate necklaces also from a Mei
I have got quite a few of these and
makes and match them but this hexagon
one is probably my most worn and fine
and so delicate so feminine and they
work with all of my outfits so yes I've
been wearing those most days throughout
the summer and one more accessory
favorites that I have worn it so much of
the summer is this Park tour - Rochelle
sunglasses from mango I picked these up
from a source but they're sold out on
easels but they are still in stock on
man yo calm again links will be down
below but these artists found incredibly
versatile they do elevate an outfit in
division so stylish very timeless and
what I love about them is that they
don't have it in modules here so I love
to wear sunglasses on my head in fact
it's pretty much my signature so on
hairstyle and but if they have no tools
in it then it's not yours is that real
worth don't know you guys know I mean if
they have nodules in then it just kind
of ruined your hairstyle it sucks all
the hairs out so I'm a big fan of the
fact that they did not have modules
turns they're not yours or what I'm
really sorry on last but not least is
this top trauma revile and I didn't feel
like I actually wore it that much on my
youtube channel or in any photos but I
got so so so much use out of this top
and I think it's so beautiful it's a
nice unusual neckline it has this I
don't even know what would call this
neckline is like a factor front
alternative that makes sense
but I thought it was so unusual I love
this fill detail on shoulders and
similar to the caramel and dress I'm a
huge fan of this rosary on grey star
material so all this absolutely
it looks fabulous with denim shorts on
holiday and skirts jeans and I up that
you love the fact that your shoulders
are on display so if you've got really
nice broad shoulders then this really
helped to show them off so yeah another
one is my top ten both warrant for that
so I'm going to be really sneaky and add
in eleventh piece but this is actually
what I'm going to be doing my giveaway
for so you probably have seen these all
over my channel and Instagram they are
the MS oops so these are again from
Shion and they look identical to mo

affordable so to use come in a variety
