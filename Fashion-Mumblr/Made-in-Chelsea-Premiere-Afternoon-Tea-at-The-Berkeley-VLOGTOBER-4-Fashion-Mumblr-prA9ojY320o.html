all of this seems to be going really
quickly hope you are enjoying it so far
last time last time last week's last
vlog Toba was very much like countryside
hanging out of the family and this time
it's kind of the opposite lots of things
going on in London starting with tonight
it's already five o'clock so slightly
weird time to start a vlog but I was not
really doing anything exciting today
just working emails um for Matt's head
out now and got quite an exciting
evening but I thought before I go as
usual and it's going to give you a
little outfit of the day so I'm wearing
this Dorothy Perkins Julie you might
have seen I included the brown one in my
September favorites video and I also
mentioned I had the pink one and that's
this then this is just a roll neck top
from Topshop with the nice little frilly
sleeves and my usual Swarovski necklace
light pink jeans from Zara
telling Murphy boots and they're gonna
be wearing my usual Radley handbag
so I didn't actually explain what we
were doing this evenings wasn't a bit of
a rush leaving the house but as you
might be able to see behind me we've
just come to their premiere of the new
season and Made in Chelsea not sure what
season it is but the new season we're
here in the honey otter hotel and as you
can see down there it's repacked so Joey
and I have been banished to the upstairs
and so far we're the only ones in the
upstairs area area so um yeah private
viewing a train and Chelsea looks like
the cast starting to arrive I mean like
she quit Mother's but suddenly ran and
when there's time someone who is he oh
my god
Jamie's a Chelsea please
we just finished watching the first
episode in the series really
entertaining always I've always amazed
that they managed to make all the
episodes really entertaining what do you
think Charles yeah lots of good fashion
as always and lots of stitching each
other up but yeah it's really funny I
thought was definitely one of the
funniest ODEs that we've seen lots of
giggling moments and it's really nice
having the powers like things
family
morning guys it's Thursday morning last
night was so much fun I didn't really
vlog once I got home but as you saw
China I went to the premiere of season
10 of Maine Chelsey is so much fun all
the cast were there three of them I met
a couple times before but it was just it
was so different watching it with the
cast they're like really funny hearing
them laughing along and I guess it's the
first time that they've seen it as well
so it must be really funny sing like the
behind the scenes bits I'm not gonna
give not behind the scenes but you know
when they're talking about each other
and they're not there you know I mean
like it would be really I don't wanna
give anything away but yeah really good
first episode really funny and yeah I
just can't wait to watch the rest of the
season so that was really good fun
Charlie and I came home it gave Dexter
lots of kisses and then went to bed so
not too much to report on last night
today woken up and is absolutely
beautiful outside literally the sunniest
most lovely morning really cool and
crisp it's only about 9 o'clock right
now I've had quite a lazy morning
Charlie and I didn't get to bed until
maybe one o'clock so yeah had a bit of a
lie-in which I don't normally do very
unusual didn't get out of bed until like
half 7:00 which is crazy for me and I've
just been catching up on emails and
watching a few YouTube videos this
morning been having loads of trouble
with my skin recently actually I've just
I've just done my makeup as you can see
um and even through my foundation and I
put on quite a high coverage foundation
this morning you can still see my pores
like they've been quite bad recently
without makeup on but never before have
I put my makeup on and you've Steve
still being able to see them I don't
think you'll be able to tell from this
camera but it's really bad that you can
actually see the force through my makeup
so if anyone has any recommendations on
something I can try to like clear them
up then let me know because it's really
stressing me out
Dexter's obviously having a hard morning
aren't you little man how am I supposed
to get any work done when you're so
caught before the premiere yesterday I
also went into Topshop picked up a few
pieces don't know if it's the same
anywhere else
in the UK we're now getting charged for
carrier bags so I'm now taking tote bags
with me everywhere if I have any viewers
and other countries let me know if it's
just in UK or not but these are just
three pieces I picked up from Topshop so
I got this little bag it's all quite
handy size quite seventies thought that
was really lovely this jumper just kind
of fell in love with the color thought
that'd be really practical nice very
autumnal color and it would look really
cute with this skirt no surprise me
buying another suede skirt but yeah this
is really lovely quite pricey 80 pounds
and I haven't tried it on yet so
hopefully this'll look trouble with me
snapped at the time as I've always
believed tracking stripes Lodge and
wives finding on snapchat
actually using my snapchat warm which is
pretty good so don't know if I'm
explaining I'm doing out of town on
Argyle Street and just about to go into
even pistol
one of the streets to have a piece of
our spray tan you guys watch my Fashion
Week not to know that love
peter degraph three times so yeah I'm
just going to get one now nice and
Oh
his hands
I didn't put too much
want to be
my decision to make
it defines how much a princess
okay so the tournament's done with
feeling a lot better now it was feel so
much better when I've got a bit of color
now I haven't told you about yourself a
new really excited going for an
afternoon tea at the Barclays within my
favorite girls and Barclays in my
favorite place in that the world for
afternoon tea because you know I've seen
on my blog on the fear of use of that
but they basically make all the cakes
and biscuits look like rushing things so
you have Everage cookies one-two combo
plates so really really nice to look at
that now I'm in Safari and the driver
who is Sabrina and Gemma here you guys
know very well but don't you have ever
blogged in the past minute but um yeah
so the tea as I was saying is based
around springing up so much deeper
Springs available to international
trends the menu it is this bright green
or pink menu changes all the time during
your conscious brain uses to spring the
summer swings over 15 they need to catch
up so pink so that will be based around
in fashion items and that cookery is
really colourful as well as Wedgwood
yeah Wedgwood crockery design just for
the Barclays I think okay
that is incredible jan-julius on with
tweets about to try to decorate it
that is incredible thank you really
lovely afternoon tea at the Berkeley
laughter feeling really full and then we
rushed over to believe and minerals
Christmas event and they launched some
really lovely gift sets so I will show
you those when I yeah or maybe I'll show
you them in the morning because I never
really feel like Bobbie my phone with my
makeup looking dreadful and
so I shall see you guys so today is
Dexter's first day joining me for
meetings I'm also having to carry you
didn't see that but a big bag of Krispy
Kreme doughnuts so carrying Krispy Kreme
doughnuts and a dog because somebody is
in a bit let's drop and refuses to walk
by himself so it's not been terribly
easy but it's quite fun taking him to
the meetings everybody seems really
really love him and he's been getting so
many kisses so that's been fun just
trying to find a restaurant our our
meeting Sunglasses Hut for lunch so I
will vlog later hey guys dirty dance
I've been really bad at some vlogging
today so I'm really sorry about that but
as you saw very briefly earlier I took
Dexter with me today and it's very hard
trying to vlog when you have a little
boy in one of your arms I didn't vlog
tell you what I did
I basically actually just went for a
couple meetings wasn't even that
exciting but what is exciting is I am
now the proud owner of a Krispy Kreme
red card which basically means I get a
box of 12 Donuts every month for the
rest of the year and I basically been
doing like a little a little campaign
with them on the blog and it's promoting
this video isn't sponsored by the way I
decided to leave Alex is genuinely
really cool it's promoting their friends
at Krispy Kreme and if you sign up you
get a free donut and signing up free
donor on your birthday and yeah I just
think it's very cool and it's free to
sign up so why wouldn't you yeah leave
the blog down below if you want to read
it as I said this isn't sponsored but
it's genuinely an amazing campaign so I
thought I would tell you about it I have
just photographed them look Dexter is
trying to pull that pull him down you
hear Milligan he's been such a bad boy
since he got home he's being a little
mad mad little monkey so yeah I just
rushed home to photograph them before
the light went I think the blog post is
going out I have you before this video
goes out
because it's the opposite I really like
the photos so definitely go and check
that out
oh and let me show you what the what the
gold card came with because this is
really cool but I hung it up next to my
dressing gown this is a Krispy Kreme
varsity jacket I'm gonna have to show
you this on because really pretty
spectacular yeah so I was probably just
as excited about this some jacket as I
was about the free doughnuts actually
Alya it's definitely more excited about
the doughnuts but let me go to the other
room by the lighting is a little bit
better and I can show you here's my
doughnut so they picked up 12 doughnuts
or freshly photographed room behind me
