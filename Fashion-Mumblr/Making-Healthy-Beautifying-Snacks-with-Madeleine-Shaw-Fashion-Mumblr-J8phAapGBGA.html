you can see I have a fabulous guest with
me in today's video it is the beautiful
Madeleine Shaw and Madeleine has invited
me into their gorgeous home and we are
going to be making what are we gonna
making we're gonna be making or two
things actually gonna do a chocolate
date bar which is like perfect for p.m.
energy snack and then homemade hummus
because I feel like everyone buys her
ass with it it's yeah the most simple
thing to make when you eat the
ingredients for like I could do that you
guys know I've been trying to be a lot
more healthy recently and that is
actually thanks to you mouthing there
and I met originally episode farmhouse a
few weeks ago and I've been using quite
a lot of the recipes to make healthy
things that happen so Prince I need to
be healthy and we also filmed a video on
that length channel which is going to be
all about like autumn beauty favorites
because I know you're in intimacy I love
her as well as before so this is my
favorite so yeah head over to my channel
to see that video yes I'm subscribed to
Madeline if you haven't already so we're
going to start by making the healthy
chocolate bars I can actually get it in
my head the chocolate bars gonna be
healthy you're going to change this
definitely like I'm bored about like not
about like deprivation of food I think
it's a little that and we all crave
something sweet but sure this is a
really good alternative to make grabbing
a chocolate bar that's so easy to make
but it's just chucking everything in the
food processor
yeah so I'll come find you nuts take the
heat so we've got some medjool dates
which are like the soft kind of squidgy
day you can just use normal day but what
I love about these things
really well and soap opera to be a
predecessor and these are singing kind
of dates that you wrap a Christmas there
are kind of Christmasy yeah it certainly
they live so they get faster ones we've
got
I prefer pecans or walnuts but that's
not I don't know my favorite okay and
then I put in some almonds as well in
there and we've got some raw cacao
powder this is like basically like cocoa
powder but it hasn't been heated so
really rich to make magnesium which is
going to let your muscles part of
antioxidants and that's what's gonna
give it like a chocolatey taste that
almonds are they good for energy or is
it like making you not feel hungry all
the time
yeah like they've got like a really good
source of healthy fats and also vitamin
E Li which is like the skin glowing like
bitumen so it helps they produce like
that glow on your skin so you want to
eat armors every day so not only these
chocolate bars but yeah exactly what
about I like them what was he gonna put
in some coconut oil in here and that's
going to help sort of bind it all
together and make it solidify so it
okay kerubim set for like a minute like
Rhett and it depends on how you like
your touch I like that to be a little
bit of crunch and NZT so I capped it
with this texture where you can see this
little bit super punch in math so if you
just blend it on a slow-speed together
no no no that's just I have one speech
uh one speak girl it's just about a
minute but if he kept going he could
almost get mugged GX German which is
really nice it depends how I'm okay I
always want to really push it down to
this like no and you basically just
chuck it into the freezer for about half
an hour to an hour it's gonna harden up
and then slice it into bars and then I
just
Madeline if we can put some go to raise
on top because these are my favorite
thing in the world
yeah yeah yeah yeah so now that we have
got our of the use of our Sonic speeds
bug in the digital ISA as I'm gonna
sleep rich so I'm doing it in the
freezer so that it's a little bit
quicker and so I'm just I'm gonna
mention person me too
that's genius water in freezer we're
going to make homemade hummus which so I
just got a can of chickpeas that I've
drained off pretty simple so the
chickpeas are actually already kept so
if you've got the dried chickpeas you
can do it with that to go to use the
cooked ones you know sometimes if you
buy one of my own stick yeah yeah okay
exactly what chickpeas and in the book
tahini which is like ground sesame seed
so about three tablespoons of the tahini
and this is just for taste or just
having help perfect yeah it's good to
hear you sassy me I like everything
I'm messy Connie we will see it I'm
gonna find it that later today
what do you'll find it yes speaking if
you can hear it any background noise by
the way we do have a little puffy
rustling around don't we make a very
slow but it okay so I'm going back with
the tiny yeah it's got a good source of
calcium so if there's some of this neat
dowry yeah so that's a good one so we
just basically blends together
okay so once she lands it into a sort of
paste I mean there could be a few chunks
left in that moment I'm doing to squeeze
the lemon and also it looks like you see
so we've got the juice this is a small
lemon I'd only go for like half the
lemon if it's a take a lemon
okay yeah no no it's cool and then also
we're going to put in a little bit of
smoked paprika just a bit of kick
probably about half a teaspoon going in
there and there's some sea salt so this
is like pink Himalayan salt yeah this is
all the rage of the mountain
Himalayan salt isn't it yeah I think
everyone to this thought thought was bad
for you but actually it's just all of
the qualities they're like sea salt pink
Himalayan salt anything that looks a
little bit dirty is actually eats dirty
souls and you've been salting your water
in ways
did you know what I used to but I've got
out of the habit of it but it is meant
to help absorb the Duchess's right yeah
it helps you absorb end
okay let's then go
so here is like it's a limit thing we
should be smoked paprika but it's a nice
house that okay but that's the sort of
tacitly one quantity as well considering
like chicopee's are quite cheap oh my
god so they are this food costs you you
like nothing compared to what home is
cause you know maybe like a quick 50 to
make this that's amazing
I like the Marxist analysis watching I'm
54 a serviceman yeah absolutely
probably lasts like maybe like five days
in the fridge and most popular with
everything further making free little
pretty do you like when I when I tweet
when I've made one of your recipes I try
and copy all focused are olympus pumpkin
pumpkin season my soup yeah it's like
it's a job it's not the most amazing joy
peace happiness diet oh my gosh okay
she'll get some crudités and then let's
get some free today
so I just chopped the bars into like in
this whole bite giant bite size and then
you have put some little red peppers and
push out and then a nice people suspect
happy :
but then these are just really easy
things that you can make us a snack yeah
okay boys looking for like good snack
ideas and they think that these are just
something like these will last for like
two weeks
really I laid off such other words you
could make them on the mats exactly and
then you could just take them to work
that's a really good idea for work
actually because so many my friends they
sit at their desk and they just have
like don't know they have unhealthy
stuff lying around yeah but if you have
something that tastes amazing and it's
healthy yeah so I guess the only thing
to do I know that we didn't blend it too
much you like right yeah so good who
needed like adding some more crunchy
bits nice delicious choice oh it's like
a because we read all around the house
hmm so check down below if you want to
make these yourself
home and of course check out Madeline's
verbs and her website it's basically my
Bible now so Thank You Madeline for
showing you these gorgeous recipes
you'll be similar on my snapchat quite a
lot as you can imagine and don't forget
