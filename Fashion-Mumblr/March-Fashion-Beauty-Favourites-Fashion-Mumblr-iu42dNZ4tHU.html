really super day today it is officially
spring time and climb in such a good
mood I've said it so many times but
spring is by far my favorite season of
all the seasons I love the clothes I
love the weather I love the beauty
trends I just love everything about
spring so I think I'm going to be doing
a lot more kind of spring themed videos
over the next couple of weeks so yeah so
I'd stick that one out they're gonna be
doing a lot of spring things over on my
youtube channel if you don't want to
miss any of them then make sure you are
subscribed I'll put a little button here
so you can subscribe if you haven't
already and yeah I'm really hoping to
get to 15,000 subscribers soon so yes
please do subscribe if you haven't
subscribed yet this month's favorites my
March favorites is quite high-end I have
to say a lot of these products are quite
luxurious not for any particular reason
just they happen to be the ones that
I've been loving using this month so to
make up for it I'm going to be doing a
drugstore springtime makeup tutorial
really really soon so keep your eyes
open for that I need to change position
because I went to a gym this morning and
did like my thighs and oh my god they
burn I'm going to sit on a cushion ah
that's better
okay back to my favourites so the first
thing in my favourites is probably the
most high-end sink and it's the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation now you
guys if you watch a lot of YouTube
videos will probably have heard all
about this before but for me this is
quite a new discovery I actually had
never tried Giorgio Armani makeup before
this month and out of everything that I
was really kindly sent this is by far my
favorite product definitely like a stand
out product I've just been using this
every single day since I got it I took
it to Hong Kong with me this month if
you haven't seen my Hong Kong outfit
Diaries vlog I will link that down below
cos it's a really fun video and take
this with me to Hong Kong so kind of put
it through its paces when it comes to
humidity and dry after airplane skin and
all the time I was there and when I was
back home just been loving the effect
that this gives I'm wearing it right now
so how it's coming up on camera but in
real life is quite a beautiful glowy
foundation even if you've got quite dry
skin as I said mine is quite dry after
getting off the airplane but this just
gave such a lovely glow coverage wise
it's a good coverage but it doesn't look
like you're wearing too much makeup
which again I absolutely love and I find
it very quick and blendable to apply so
you don't need to spend ages making sure
you've got everything blended in I never
get any marks which weirdly I've been
noticing more of my tips and
moisturizers recently it is an expensive
product but I've just been really loving
how the slips on my skin I really like
the packaging as well and I'm really
looking forward to trying out more from
Giorgio Armani so I'll let you know how
I get along with everything else
underneath the Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation I've been applying this
primer and it's a brand which i think is
quite a new launch it's called um
skincare or om the skincare and I've
seen this in Space NK which kind of to
me is always the seal of approval the
kiss of approval if you will that it's
really good brand so this is available
Space NK and this is their invisible
finish primer in SPF 40 with UVA and UVB
protection for all skin types and
firstly it was the SPF 40 that really
impressed me because I've just been
really conscious recently I'm always
conscious of it but even more so
recently now the Sun is actually coming
out I'm using natural daylight from this
video so hopefully it's alright but the
Sun is out which means that we really
need to be extra extra extra careful
about protecting our skin we don't want
to be getting any kind of skin problems
on an older or even in the near future
from sun damage
so the SPF 40 in this is what makes me
really love it but other than that it's
a really good primer so basically it's
almost like a tinted moisturizer so it's
definitely got some coloring and
blurring effects to when you first put
it on and it acts as a really nice base
of your makeup on days and I'm staying
at home I'll just apply this because as
I said it does give a lovely finish but
it also works really well underneath
that the Giorgio Armani silk finish
foundation and
other foundations to be honest overall I
just find that it makes my makeup last a
really long time it doesn't make my skin
look all your greasy or dry it just
gives a really good canvas basically
everything that you want a primer to do
I've also got some serums a Beauty
booster from this brand but I want to
give those a little bit of testing for a
bit longer before I let you know about
them because they are skin care but this
have been using for a few weeks and I've
been really really enjoying plus I
really like the packaging white and gold
just very chic and it looks really nice
on my dressing-table so big fan of this
one from UM skincare
another super oh gosh what's going on
that I just curled my hair like a few
minutes before this videos they're a
little bit out of control
coming back to skincare so another
really luxurious product which I have
been absolutely loving using this month
is this one and there's not new to my
collection at all I just picked it up
about a week or so ago and really
reminded myself how flip amazing this is
and it's the doll found eight flower
nectar oil cream you've probably seen
this on my blog and probably on my
youtube channel a few times now but this
is honestly if you love products but if
you when you spend a lot of money on
skincare you want to really feel like
you're using an incredibly luxurious
product then this is absolutely the one
not only does it have I talk so much
about the darn smell but I just think
it's so us so having me but this smell
is another level like it's a really
strong version of the darthon smell just
so florals so kind of just the most
luxurious Sparr smell you could imagine
your whole life even if you just walk
past the counter and get a whiff of this
it really is it's something else so love
the smell that goes without saying but
also the consistency of this is
absolutely unlike anything else that I
have in my skincare collection it's the
oil cream which is somewhat between an
oil and a cream as it might be able to
guess so if you haven't have a used oil
in your skincare routine before then it
might be a nice way to kind of inject
some oil into a skincare routine without
going through a full of oil
texture-wise it's quite hard to describe
i fate's say a very light buttery
texture even
kind of moosie but without all the air
bubbles and and it's just absolutely
heavenly to apply it just goes on like
it feels as pampering as a really thick
rich moisturizer but it sinks in and it
doesn't stick on the skin like a rich
moisturizer would do and the results I
just find that I wake up with lovely
fresh looking skin and healthy-looking
skin which at the end of the day is what
I want so I have nothing bad to say
about this it is pricey but oh my gosh
highly highly recommend if you want to
splurge on some skincare final uber
luxury beauty products is this one and I
think you will have seen this in oh my
god I've just noticed the biggest cobweb
in that corner you know in there like
black and dusty anyway back to makeup
know why I was looking in that corners
is like hello that's a big cobweb
bronzer Tom Ford bronzer honestly look
at this product it is so gorgeous I
can't even hold that it's so big I
absolutely adore the packaging of this
it's got this look who could see my face
step okay that was an epic fail um yeah
packaging of this is amazing whenever I
go for a weekend away or traveling
anywhere this is a bronzer that comes
with me a ticket to Hong Kong I took it
to wherever I went before a weekend
break before that I can't remember but
the mirror in it is ginormous which it's
so handy when you're traveling the
bronzer is such an amazing shade it's
impossible to make yourself look orange
with this bronzer because it's such a
rich and expensive looking color I can't
describe it in any other way I think I
said that in the blog post about this it
just gives you I mean it's the kind of
makeup you can tell is worth the money
because it just gives such an amazing
bronze color it's in the gorgeous white
packaging which is Tom Ford's summer
collection I think this actually last
year's one so I got this a few months
ago I'm wearing it today but not too
much I've just swirled it all over the
face but because it is quite so quite
said deep bronze you can also use a
smaller brush and do a little bit of
contouring with it but I just wanted to
go over colors
wearing today again an expensive one but
one in my opinion is so worth it I'm
absolutely in love with this thinking
even smells nice too okay doesn't have a
smell it's the girl on products it smell
amazing but Tom Ford this is just so
beautiful and it even has a little dust
cloth for it which is a sign of a truly
overly luxurious product when it has its
own dust cloth and I don't want it to
get scratched so I keep it in there all
the time okay moving away from kind of
facial beauty and onto hair beauty I
haven't included any hair products in a
monthly favorites and quite a long time
I don't think because well though I've
been trying a lot nothing has been quite
amazing enough for me to mention it in a
favorites video which is literally like
my top 10 products or things of the
whole month but this however well and
truly deserves its place within my
favorites I've actually been really
loving using Cara Styles as a whole this
month which is the brand of this product
this is the carat stars elixir all-team
olio complex intra silane I never would
call it that whole name let's us quickly
look see at all team and it's basically
a very light oil spray for your hair
which you apply when your hair is damp
and you're about to comb through it
before a blow-dry now when I get out
shower my hair is always so so so
naughty even if I go to like the gym or
something I'm gonna shower there I
always have to take something with me to
detangle my hair it gets so naughty
especially kind of around the crown area
I just get like matted you know you
stroke a dog too much and it gets matted
that's what my hair is like this just
instantly detangles it I don't know how
it works
but it's just such an incredible product
it's so light it doesn't weigh the hair
down which is what I was a little bit
concerned about when I thought about
spraying and oil all over my hair as
opposed to just applying a little bit in
the ends and it smells so good there's a
bit of a running theme with products
that smell amazing this month but this
makes my hair I used it a few hours ago
makes my hair smell so good again really
luxurious it smells expensive I hate
saying necks it sounds really tacky but
you know when you just know you just
know that the product is a really good
quality one I'm not sure if you can see
but it's kind
for eight teams to the product that I've
used is up to there at the moment and
it's like a light liquid there and then
the heavier oil has sunk to the bottom
so I just give it a good old shake up
before I apply it you can see that now
it's more up to here um having somebody
it's up to here I've been using this
maybe three or four times a week for the
past two months so and I apply it quite
liberally because as I said dreadlock
had so I applied quite a lot of this
very often and I'm really impressed that
it's not gone down that much so it just
shows you how fine the spray is if you
are worried about an oil really weighing
down your hair so I've been loving using
that and while we're on the topic of
hair the pair of straighteners have
really been making me happy this month
these are by brand called cloud 9 I feel
do not get enough blogger and youtuber
exposure and love because they are
seriously good so I actually met the PR
girls lacrosse deaf cloud 9 and they
were telling me that the owner or
founder of cloud 9 is the guy that
actually was the founder of THD I hope
I've got that right and he left GHD when
the company sold and he obviously knew
how to make amazing straighteners so he
developed this brand and compared to HD
I like them as much if not more and yeah
I know that's saying quite a bold
statement I love the color of them I
love the work for the land I love the
set of black and white the white is kind
of a frosted material and the only
downside I would say is that they are
going to get foundation marks on them
normally when I do my hands before my
makeup and I did give them a little wipe
down before this video because I already
had a little bit of foundation or fake
tan marks on them so that's the only
downside so if you can hear my throwing
paint put that on silent and they do not
have any buttons on them the way you
turn them on once they're plugged in is
by just slapping them together like that
and there are two temperature settings
and I'm not sure if you have to do like
a double tap to change the temperature
but when I turn them on they
at 195 degrees it's just a little number
in that which is illuminated and for me
that seems like a really good
temperature it also says 165 maybe
that's just the warming up one so
there's a super quick to warm up they
make a nice little noise within about
three seconds so that is absolutely
crazy speedy warmup time
that's super duper light as well they
literally they are perfect for traveling
because they're so light and I don't
have a bad thing to say about these i
curled my hair with them this morning
I'm not the best at curling my hair but
I think these are not too bad and yeah I
just really really like them and think
that more people should consider getting
cloud9 straighteners all righty so we've
gone from beauty and skincare and makeup
to hair and now I'm gonna go back to
body so there are a couple of things
that I've been loving this month full
body first of which is this and it's the
doctor organic bioactive skincare
Moroccan glow body polish preet an
exfoliator a nice short catchy name
we've got that and no seriously you
don't have to say all those words doctor
organic body polish is what this is and
it's mainly I think it's been bought out
as a pre fake tanning product because
they also bought out an incredible range
of fake tans with within this whole
Moroccan range and but this is the pre
term exfoliator and it says essential
skin preparation body polish with micro
particles of pure volcanic lava
exfoliating rejuvenating and smoothing
so this product is mostly natural
ingredients and I want to say 100
percent natural because I'm not entirely
sure but it's free from parabens
synthetic colors and petrolatum
silicones so generally it's a really
good product it's not full of loads of
rubbish ingredients and it really really
really works so this sometimes I find if
exfoliators have got nice big coarse
it's like this one does it's got the
volcanic lava in it sometimes I find
that it's a little bit too drying on the
skin whereas the creamy kind of
consistency that the exfoliating
particles are held with it is really
nice and moisturizing so when I use on
my skin I feel like you don't have to
choose between exfoliating or pampering
this does both and it really does
exfoliate without being too harsh on the
skin which
really liking recently so I've been
using this every time I showered pretty
much as well as exfoliating gloves if I
am going to be tanning afterwards
because then you just get the double hit
of exfoliation and it's nearly gone so
I'm gonna have to get a new one I think
they're from boots and Superdrug yeah I
just been really really enjoying using
this I think it's because of the is it
macadamia nuts and this or something I'm
not sure what that picture it's let me
have a look okay so it says it's got
sweet almond oil in it so I'm guessing
these are almonds I think it's the oil
presence within this that makes it so
moisturizing it means that even though
you're exfoliating you're not drying out
the skin so I think that's why I've been
loving it so much because it really does
give your skin the best start if you're
about to tan because if you're tanning
either flaky or dry skin it's not going
to look good so this is just a really
super pre tanning product and I've
really really been enjoying using this
this month
as Charlie and then following that the
fake tan or gradual tan I've been loving
using on a regular basis I've been
enjoying using the Moroccan oil tan when
I really want to get like a tan tan but
to have just a really nice glow
throughout the whole month I've been
absolutely loving the Vita Liberata
marula dry oils self tan in SPF 50 so
again with the SPF like 50 is really
really high so it's really good for when
you're in the UK you're not like out
there to get a tan or anything and it's
just great for being protected against
sun damage but what I love about this is
that it's very unusual because it's a
dry oil fake tan which I've never even
heard of before let alone tried so
because it's an oil it's just really
lovely and pampering to use it's a
really nice thing to apply after a long
hot bath or shower when you put it on
the oil itself is actually very heavily
tinted so you do have a really nice
color straightaway so if you are going
to go maybe you're on holiday to this
with you and you're about to go an
evening to the beach or wherever you
would already have a really nice color
straightaway when you apply this and a
teeny bit of shimmer as well which just
looks absolutely gorgeous but it's also
a gradual tan so
I have to say that if I was to make any
recommendations this time I would say
I'd like it to be a little bit darker
and I mean this is the color that I am
now I don't see the pale on screen I'm
actually not that pale I promise but
I've been using this as I said pretty
much every time I Charlotte for the past
two weeks and I would like to be a
little bit darker but it's just a very
very gradual tan so while it does make
you look dark as soon as you put it on
because the dark oil it doesn't make you
too dark actual tan wise if that makes
sense but it's nice if you just want to
slowly start building up a gradual tan
maybe this week on a holiday and it
really is a lovely product to use and
it's a three-in-one because the oil and
that bronze is you and the gradual tan
and the SPF 50 and similarly to similar
uses similarly to the body polish this
is obviously a dry oil and oil as you
guys know is really nice and
moisturizing to the skin so it helps
your tan last longer makes a ton look
better and generally nice and
moisturizing plus I really like the
packaging of this it's a really nice
kind of substantial glass bottle with a
rose gold lids need I say anymore and
and the product inside is looks really
nice I always give it a good shake
before I put it on but it's really
lovely bronze kind of metallic e-liquid
in that so really but nothing using that
this much okay we're getting down to the
last few products now we have finished
with the beauty another favorite of mine
this month are Mikey something will sake
wait I surely its key like florida keys
or different spec anyway these
sunglasses have been an absolute
favorite this month you guys probably
seen them I live my Instagram in
hundreds of outfit photos on my blog
hope you guys check my blog out every
now and then I do really nice outfit
photos every now and then and beauty
shots as well but yeah loving these
sunglasses they're kind of marble
ish I think they're called like sugar
spice on a sauce I'll leave a link down
below but I just love them and you know
what else I love is that you can put
them on top of your head and they don't
get caught in my hair because they don't
have the I have a major déjà vu I think
I've said this all before maybe
in last month's favorites in which case
I still love them if not I'm going mad
but they don't have the toggles here
which means that even if I have my hair
up they don't get caught in my hair
which doesn't ruin your hairstyles lots
of nice bonus but I just love them I
think they're super big and fun maybe
not the most flattering I do look like a
bit of a blue bottle fly but I really
really like them then make quite a
statement there Marbley they're just
gorgeous I love them
we cannot go past Easter and not include
Easter eggs in our monthly favorites
cream eggs are my favourite eggs in the
world yes I have a favorite egg Cadbury
Easter eggs they call me anything other
than Cadbury and for me cream eggs are
just the best thing in the world so as
soon as they went down in sale after
Easter Charlie nine have stocked up
we've got like a fridge full of cream
eggs not too good for the pre holiday
diet but hey ho they're amazing and they
only this big so how bad can it be for
you um yeah just thought I'd give a
shout-out to cream makes this month I've
gone through quite a lot of them and I
thought they were worthy of a shout out
I don't actually think I can hold this
and not eat it so just bear with me a
moment I just ate a considerable amount
of foil okay that took a lot longer than
I anticipated to eat never try using
your cream egg when you're under
pressure or on camera because kind of
took the fun out of it not gonna lie
anyway on to my final favorite of the
month and this is kind of two birds with
one stone because since January you
might know that I've been doing my
favorite bloggers mail of the month on
favorite kind of thing that I've
received over the month and this month
it is a favorite item and also my
favorite blog mail item of the month and
it is this amazing amazing nail polish
set from L'Oreal Paris so in here we
have actually have you encountered we
have 22 nail varnishes in this set and
firstly this set itself is just
absolutely gorgeous we've got to kind of
like plastic muti trolls and inside two
drawers of the most beautiful colored
nail varnishes you can see all the
here I'll do a little closer at Purfleet
signal team even better and so the color
range is just amazing has literally got
me sorted for the rest of my life pretty
much we've now managed two colors
because I can't even think of a color
but I love that's not in here there's so
many news to choose from so many Pink's
corals Burgundy's even like random green
and glucose I wouldn't only go for but
gives me a good excuse to experiment
with them aside from the huge amazing
box the actual packaging of the
individual nail polishes as well I
absolutely adore the beautiful kind of
glass containers with a square kind of
square and Boston graved I don't know
the square pattern on a beautiful gold
lid with the color really clearly on the
top in case you couldn't see it in the
bottom but yeah I just think they're
packaging of these is absolutely
gorgeous they're very chic nothing to
kind of crazy or out their shape wise
very simple and just absolutely stunning
the colors as I mentioned before I love
I'd state beach ones here are my
favorites but also I have been wearing
this one for the past I'd say I think I
applied this just when the bank holiday
weekend was starting so about a week ago
and it is still going strong on my nails
we don't have any major chips we have a
little bit of you know and they kind of
start to pull back at the tops we have a
little bit of that going on but I have
to say I've had this on for nearly a
week I've painted the kitchen twice
that means I've had paint on my hands
I've been screwing my nails and they
still have not chipped and I still
haven't really felt the need to top them
up I will top them up because I'm going
out for a nice dinner tonight but I
think it's incredible the lasting power
of these nail polishes really really
impressed on the box it says love Ernie
Allah Allah which i think is a reference
to oil so have another little oil themed
kind of going on in this video but I
think the oil properties within this may
be what makes it last longer but it does
give the nails are really nice shiny now
it is a major selling point at saying
intense color oil shine I wouldn't say
they're like overly oily or overly shiny
I mean this is
lovely shine considering I didn't put a
top coat on but it's not like when you
would get she like manicure or if you
were to use something like a semi top
coat having said that I haven't used a
top coat and there is a clear gel not
gel sorry a clear nail varnish in here
as well so when I repaid my nails this
afternoon and use the gel I will
probably have even more shiny nails so
if you'd like to see what my nails look
like with the top coat on then follow me
on snapchat because I will show you over
there so absolutely love this amazing
set from L'Oreal a very very grateful to
incent this absolutely gorgeous I will
leave all the information about where
you can buy these polishes I think that
I'm only available individually I'm not
sure that you can buy this set but I
will leave all the information for those
down in the description box so that is
everything that I have been loving
throughout the munch munch month month
of March
it is now April which is just absolutely
crazy I know everybody's saying it but
where is 2016 going I still haven't
quite got my head around the fact that
it's 2016 and it's almost April but well
it is April by the time you're watching
this on the plus side that means that
summer is nearly here and it's
