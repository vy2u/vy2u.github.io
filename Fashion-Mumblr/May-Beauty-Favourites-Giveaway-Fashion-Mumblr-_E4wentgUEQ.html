channel can you believe it has been a
month pretty much since I started
YouTube my first video was April
favorites and now it's my favorites so I
kind of feel like um it's great that I'm
still here
thank you for sticking with me and also
thank you to everybody that subscribed
so far I think there was like four
hundred and fifty subscribers last time
I checked and I'm really happy that
people are even subscribing something
anybody would care what I have to say
but yeah so thank you so much if you've
subscribed so today's video is my may
favorites
I've been trying out a few new products
but a lot of things I am still loving
since last month like loads of makeup my
cleansing routine I'm still loving all
of that and but there are a few new
products so I'm going to start with
skincare this is actually the very first
product that I ever blogged about so
it's always gonna hold a special place
in my heart and it is the origins
ginseng energy boosting moisturizer now
um there's nothing obviously new about
this apart from the cool that it's got
like a Aboriginal Coffee Bean kind of
design on the lid which is really cool
but nothing has changed with the formula
if you've tried this before or a few
years ago it still has this amazing I
think it's my mouth water it's so nice
it's like an orange II really refreshing
you know when you peel a tangerine and
it just smells so uplifting it's
definitely got that smell about it and
it's got kind of like wobbly wobbly
jelly formula and its really good for my
skin which is combo kind of a little bit
oily but it's not too strong for my skin
my skin just drinks it in and it's meant
to be like a shots of espresso for your
skin but I really do find their wakes up
and makes me look a little bit more
perky in the mornings which is always a
good thing
this is definitely a fave for this month
also on skincare I'm still obviously
obsessed with the Liz Earle cleanse and
polish but oh my god
look at this so this is that 20th
anniversary set and it contains not one
not two but three cleanse and polish
so you've got the limited-edition rose
and lavender
and grapefruit and peg Julie apparently
and orange flower and coma and oh my god
like how beautiful I cannot wait to try
these the formula is still gonna be the
same so I know it's gonna be a favorite
but I haven't actually tried the special
edition ones yet but this is a favorite
because I still am obsessed with Liz
I'll cleanse and polish another kind of
skincare product is the San Tropez self
tan luxe
face oil you can see I've used like
maybe three weeks worth of this and this
is as you can kind of guess from the
name it's a tanning oil that you put on
your face I love telling my face I hate
it when my face is pale and rest of my
body and this is really easy to use
because you just pipette a couple of
drops and your hands rub them together
and then like press it over your face
make sure you wash your hands after it
so because I had the dreaded black web
but for about a week after I first used
this but it says Lux oil and it really
is the smell is so nice and I find some
tanning products on the face can just be
really stinky and my boyfriend always be
like oh don't come too close to me stink
but with this it's got a really kind of
luxurious smell about it and the color
that it gives your face is from really
really lovely just natural golden and
very pretty so this is most definitely a
favorite then we've got a product from
Neal's Yard distant Neal's Yard remedies
and this is their world rose beauty balm
it can be used as a cleanser or a mask
but I haven't actually been using it for
any of those things yet I've just been
using it for dry patches of skin so I
get really dry like in this area which
is really random and also on my elbows
so I've been using it it's that crazy I
don't know I've been using it for that
and it smells like spas it's just really
really lovely and the packaging is so
cute as well it's got a very I think
it's a lavender scent
it's called Wild Rose that's you know
I'm really rubbish with them fragrances
but yeah this is a really lovely product
it stops me from getting dry that I
haven't used hand cream in about like 48
hours now and it's still not drying that
area because I put this on after I last
showered I have showered since okay I'm
just gonna stop I'm kind of going in
order of how I apply products to my face
the next favorite is from brand called
Delilah and it's that underwear future
resist primer I knew I was gonna love
this because it's got a rose gold lid so
aside from the packaging it's also
really beautiful because it just keeps
on makeup in place all day long it's got
a really nice texture I don't feel like
it clogs up my pores like a few other
primers so I've been trying do and
there's loads in the tube I think it's a
really good value for money and I've not
heard of this brand before I don't think
many other bloggers even talk about it
but under the radar it's just a really
beautiful product and my skin seems to
love it plus it's got anti-aging
ingredients in it and it's something
that I am kind of thinking about
recently so this is a faith they really
have any more kind of foundation II
bronzer II eyeshadow favorites as month
because I've been pretty much using the
same stuff that I used in last month's
favorites however there's a few lip
balms which I've been loving Farms as a
whole are just a favorite of mine
I don't really bother with lipstick on
an everyday basis so if I can just add a
pop of color to my lips after I've done
my foundation then that is a bonus and
two different brands both with two
products that have been my favorites
first is benefit and they're cha-cha
bomb and purpose refund cha-cha bomb
come on and Posie barn are definitely
favorites they both just have the give a
really likes they both give a really
light subtle color to the lips
I'd say Posie Brahmans my favorites it's
just a really pretty girly pink and then
church are bomb is more of a coral color
but I just apply it
I've actually got Posie bomb on now so
you can see it's just a very light wash
of color and then it kind of tints your
lips afterwards as well so they're
really beautiful
and then for a very similar product it's
the currents instant light lip-balm
perfectors these were a favorite of mine
I think since way back in like my March
favorites on that blog and they are
still a favorite and the benefit ones
kind of reminded me how much I love the
client's ones and these are just so
stunning they are an absolute favorite
of putting in my makeup bag they look
beautiful the actual product itself
inside is stunning and I just recently
got this slightly deeper shade it's the
0-5 yeah it's the red one and it just
gives such a kind of like Snow White
tinted red lips it's seriously beautiful
so these are definitely favorites and
then when I finished apply my makeup I
have got into a new habit of spritzing
my face and the product that I have been
doing that with has been the quarterly
beauty elixir and so many bloggers were
like oh my gosh Tracy you have to try
this it's so good and I saw it in
Sephora once and I was like all do I
wanna do I wanna buy X I was going
through a phase of using the Urban Decay
one so I didn't buy it but recently I
just caved and trying this out and it is
so lovely the smell is almost kind of I
see I want to see cucumber II um I don't
know if it just reminds me of holidays
you know when you go on holiday and the
room smell really fresh that's kind of
what this smells like it's almost almost
a little bit clinical but more cucumber
ease fari very like awakening and it's
just a beautiful smell but I apply this
after I finish doing my makeup so that
freshens it all up a little bit and then
I also keep in my desk at works about
three o'clock in the afternoon I feel a
little bit like you know drab and this
really freshens it up you have to give
it a good shake because you can see it
goes a little bit yellowy at the top but
it's just a beautiful so this is a
favorite and while I'm talking about
caudally it has some exciting news I
have ten of the quarterly my perfect

products and I've got 10 to give away so
you're quite likely to win and the yeah
I'll pop all the details of the blog
post where you can enter in the link
below I can't remember if I talked about
this in last month's favorites but I if
I did I'm sorry I'm so obsessed that if
I didn't then I should have done because
I love it it's a nurse I'll it apart
from botanical essence in number 15 it's
just the most gorgeous fragrance it's
just worn and lovely and kind of musky
and you know when a fragrance just makes
you feel really like um happy and
relaxed and just really good memory is
that I've never smelled this before but
still just makes me feel really like
another I just love it and then the last
few products this is something I should
have talked about when I was talking
about my makeup but I forgot this is the
HD perfecting powder and it's wrong a
brand called
as a French friend so I'm sorry for my
accent is rubbish but it's shun together
or Xiang to go yeah it's that HD
perfecting powder and it is seriously
the most beautiful powder I've ever
tried it's like silky and light and it
doesn't clog anything up or make you
look cakey and it's just I mean the
packaging for one is beautiful it's in
this really gorgeous like kind of mostly
silver looks almost naturally like
she'll like Steel's and I don't know
it's really cool but this I use it when
I'm going to be taking lots of pictures
because it's got like HD Oh hair brushy
kind of finished to it and it's just
stunning and it's really good for
keeping my under eye makeup in place so
this is gorgeous and defo a fav and then
haircare I've got the window and moody
fortifying shampoo and conditioner this
is a doer which I've been keeping in my
spare bathroom and I found my side
like going in that bathroom but because
I know that these are in there I've been
going in there way more recently the
reason why I put them in the spare one
is because they are so beautiful I just
kind of wanted to show off that I have
fancy shampoo and conditioner and they
really are stunning so whenever I use
them my hair is really Gauci and it
smells amazing and you know when you're
using really luxurious shampoo and
conditioner you can kind of tell when
you're using it because it just lovers
more and it smells amazing and you feel
like it really pampering yourself so
Windell and moody these are amazing and
then I would say that's it but I feel
the need to talk about a really sad
bunch of things right now I am obsessed
with stationary like it's a weird little
obsession that I have and I have to say
that these notebooks need to go in my
favorites because I mean they are so
cute I picked these up from Selfridges
and they were ridiculously expensive I
think I took the price tags off I think
this was like maybe even 16 pounds and
this was probably about 20 pounds I'm
obsessed with stationary and I thought
they look really pretty in my Instagram
pictures so that's basically why I
bought these I have read about pins and
needles so these are just really really
beautiful notebooks and I could have
resisted when I saw them so these are
fades oh I found one more thing this is
the gel effect nail varnish from nails
inc I have been wearing this or it's
kind of more like a key sister for
basically the past three weeks non-stop
I really like the formula they're long
lasting they give a kind of clumped up
effect your nails which is what you
would have if you did have actual gel on
your nails this is the color colville
mousse and I think the one I'm wearing
right now is like Porchester square or
Portman Square but I just think there's
such beautiful natural kind of colors
and the effect is just beautiful so I
love these and that's it those are all
the products that I have been loving
throughout the month of May I feel like
um we're going into summer now so maybe
next month I'll put a few like Sun
creams or things like that depending on
which I've been trying out Jun is going
