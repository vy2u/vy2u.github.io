I'm so so so happy to be sitting down at
home and filming my may favorites for
you because honestly it's been about
three if not four or more weeks since I
actually sat down at home in front of
camera because as I'm sure you guys know
if you've been following me on anywhere
really snapchat Twitter Instagram
YouTube can't stop touching my hair so
having a really bad like parting day so
yeah don't know what's going on there
yeah I thought I was saying I have been
traveling loads this month which I'm
very very grateful for had an amazing
time but Wow am I ready to sit down and
stay at home and film a few videos
although not for long
because I'm going to California in a few
days but anyway and today's video is my
may favorites and I have to say this is
probably my most practical favorites
video ever it's not hugely glamorous
there are some really lovely products in
there but also some super super
practical ones as well so I'm gonna get
started and with my main favorite of the
month and this is a very random one a
bit thing I've ever seen anyone feature
this in a favorites video before but it
is my brace so I don't know if you guys
even notice but I'm actually wearing my
brace
and actually only the bottom ones I took
the top ones out so that I can talk a
little bit more clearly but my brace is
a clear alignment I think that's what
they're called a clear brace from a
company called your smile direct um it's
I'm gonna be doing a whole vlog about it
somewhere around more too much and I've
also been talking about it a lot on my
snapchat but basically I got my my brace
fitted this month and I can already see
my teeth and moving and I really really
pleased with how you can't even tell if
I'm wearing it it's really comfortable
um and yeah I'm so excited to finally be
getting my wobbly bottom teeth sorted
out because my teeth is something that
I've always been self-conscious about
it's just like the main thing
I'm not happy with about my my face so
really excited to be getting my teeth
sorted out so yeah that's my first
favorite of the month and I thought I'd
get that out the way first because I
probably would have forgot to mention it
would forget to mention it otherwise and
might explain my slight Lisp along
similar lines I told you this favourites
is going to be super practical my next
favorite is a toothbrush so um yeah I
know really really really random but
this toothbrush is literally so good
it's the Philips Sonicare toothbrush I
think it's really expensive I'll leave
all the information down below I think
it's one of these like super
toothbrushes for people that are like a
mega serious about their teeth I was
really kind of sent this one which I'm
very grateful for and it's amazing first
of all it comes in the most ridiculously
snazzy carry case so when I went up to
Lincoln last weekend I walked out this
little looks like a gadget set I don't
know but you can take the toothbrush
apart and leave it in that so this is
gonna be really handy for Trek America
but you can just like dismantle it
yeah dismantle it I'm gonna show it in
the case and also I just I feel like a
doctor or something like I feel so
snazzy putting my toothbrush in its case
can't even explain to you guys so
there's a toothbrush in its case and
what is amazing is you can actually
charge the toothbrush from the case and
if you don't want to do that you can
charge the toothbrush from its glass so
you put it in a glass of glasses
connected to a wire and it's just
amazing and obviously it came to a teeth
really well it's really powerful and it
has loads of different settings you've
got like sensitive or whitening and yeah
I think I might do a whole blog post
about like my teeth and my whitening
routine so I get a few comments on how I
keep my teeth so white so yeah let me
know in the comments below if you'd like
a blog post all about my gonna say my
oral routine but that sounds really
dodgy if you would like a video on my
teeth and my kind of teeth routine yeah
let me know so this a makeup and it's
pink oh my god I didn't mention that
it's probably the most beautiful
toothbrush I've seen ever as well so yes
my
rush is my second monthly favorites I'm
gonna get all the non-glamorous ones out
of the way so for my third monthly
favorite is this soft and gentle
two-in-one sour and shave mousse so I
really really like this one
firstly because it's a mousse and used
to be obsessed with those rituals ones
which have the really strong smell and I
still am obsessed with them but there
are certain areas which you can't use
the more stronger smelling ones and this
one is gynaecologist approved
ph-balanced for intimate skin I told you
this was not glamorous actually I think
that's really important especially
because we're coming up to like bikini
season I put this into my hands I put on
exfoliating gloves and I exfoliate
everywhere with this which really helps
with sorry gross but like ingrown hairs
and like bumpy skin so it's a really
really good very gentle product I love
that it's a foam as well because I can
shave with it so this is pretty much all
I've been using it says 40 years per
cotton I think I've probably gone way
over 40 already and it feels really full
so yeah this is really good for like
sensitive skin for like balancing your
skin and if you still want to have a
really lovely in shower experience but
your skin is a little bit more sensitive
or if you want to use it in more
sensitive areas then I think this is a
really really good one and I just
thought I'd mention it in my favorites
because it's been a really fab product
I've been enjoying using this month I
realized with the products I've been
talking about so far this video may look
a little bit sponsored I'm not sponsored
to talk about any of these brands in
this video by the way it's pretty mel
out that another non sexy product but
one that has been really really working
this month for me is these skin iceland
blemish dots now i spoke about these on
snapchat and so many of you quite
excited about them and said you really
wanted to try them as well and wanted to
know how I get on longer term and you
may have seen in my vlogs I have had a
really pesky spot on my cheek for half
month and then as soon as I got home I
stuck one of these on it and they are a
very matte so not shiny they're not like
you can't see that you're wearing them a
very matte little circle in fact I'll
just show you and so they come in this
airtight bag which you can see I've
ripped open and then you have
little sheets here with dots on I've
already used a whole sheet and then you
have a big dot and little dots I just
stick whichever on I don't find any
spots of thicker than this I'd be quite
scary if they were and you can feel a
little bit of a tingle but nothing it
painful like some hoax the origins super
spot remover can be but it uses
salicylic acid to draw out the spots so
I'd say the main thing that happened was
it made my spot more advanced this is so
gross I'm really really sorry but you
made it ready to squeeze and then a
couple of days later it was gone and
that spots have been pestering me for so
long so if you do have ones that don't
tend to go away or you just want to get
rid of something quick
then I absolutely love love love and
highly recommend these and I'll
definitely be repurchasing what these
once I run out okay I feel like we
should start talking about things that
which are a little bit more glamorous so
another monthly favorite this month has
been the Frank body scrubs and
particularly the new travel sized ones
so these these these are part of their
grind high club which is something
they've given us a set of for scrubs and
in amazing flavors I think it's
peppermint cocoa cacao even original and
coconut I believe they are the four and
they are these they are in these little
tiny packets which are about a third of
the size of the original Frank scrub I
personally get two or three uses out of
these so I've just been sticking one in
my suitcase for each trip and I'll be
taking one with me to America next week
but they are such tough scrubs so
they're really like thick granules
obviously it's a coffee scrub so it's
really like chunky broken up coffee
beans which will really do scrub away at
the dead skin and I've actually for the
first time in my life received a
compliment on how glowing my skin is
like on my body if that makes sense and
I honestly think it is down to this and
the next product which I'm going to talk
about they smell amazing they're really
handy and yeah I really really enjoy
using them so that is my first kind of
non dorky favorite done per month and
then after that which I also contribute
to my glowy skin to this month is the
Clarins tonic body treatment oil now
I've actually just this morning
got it one use left almost finished this
but I have been using this for about
three months because I don't use it all
the time I use it more on kind of
pampering days and this is a body oil so
it's really luxurious thing to use it's
really good if your skin's a bit
dehydrated so maybe after holiday it's
very luxurious it has the most amazing
smell really lovely texture and you know
you just feel like you've just put
something really luxurious I'm going to
skin it you just feel really warm and
wonderful inside well that sounds really
ghetto with this I really like packaging
of this it's in a big glass bottle and
this one I've got here is the firming
and toning one but I believe I also have
one that's like a muscle relax one need
to double check that but I think I do
have another one of these and my
cupboard which I will be walking out as
soon as this is finished which i think
will be the next use a couple of
skincare favorites this month I can't
actually remember if I featured this in
last month's favorites so apologies if I
did but once again obsessed with it this
month and is the lab Prarie cellular
swiss ice crystal serum i really noticed
that my skin wasn't so good when i
didn't take this on holiday with me so i
was away for maybe like ten or twelve
days and my skin went so downhill i no
trouble it isn't that good for the skin
um but I did keep up a really good
skincare routine I didn't take this with
me and then as soon as I got home I
really got the glow back so it really
proved to me that this has been such a
really essential part of my skincare
routine it's very expensive it's not the
kind of thing that you were just going
by really nearly but if you do like to
invest in more luxurious skincare then
highly recommend giving this one a try
there Swiss ice crystal range is
designed for our kind of age group like
I'd say maybe early 20s to mid 30s so
it's really good at combating any signs
of pollution all the free radicals that
are in the air and early signs of aging
like prevention is better than cure that
type of thing so I'm going to continue
using this I've actually half my dosage
so I'm now using just half a pump
everyday because I do want to make sure
this lasts because obviously it's an
expensive product and I find that that
it's been working just as well so
hopefully this will continue to last me
for quite a long time and then in the
evenings I have been used
maybe twice a week the a spa overnight
to hydration therapy you may have seen
in my packing video or my like come fly
with me video I think it's called that I
put a little bit of this in a small
Mooji pot for traveling and I would
definitely be doing the same for America
because this is an intensely hydrating
very very thick gel it's not a cream
it's like almost a I want to say like a
large like consistency that is not nice
it's just basically a beautiful
consistency which you can really feel it
sitting on the skin and then overnight
your skin drinks in all the hydration
and just you wake up with such a
gorgeous glowing complexion so I've been
a huge fan of this this month I think
it's a savior after all the traveling
I've been doing smells really good as
well and yeah highly recommend if your
skin is in need of a really good drink
so I'm pretty sure I've featured this
one before as well but this month with
all the traveling it has become such an
essential could not have lived without
this and it's a pure ology kind of
frenetic multitasking hair beautifier
for perfecting color treated hair now
I've been spraying this on my hair when
it's wet so that I can actually comb
through it it stops my hair getting all
like puffy with humidity and stops my
ends getting dry honestly this has been
such a savior and I've now got quite a
collection of these minis because they
are so handy for on-the-go my worst hair
nightmare would be going on a holiday
washing my hair getting out the shower
and not having anything to detangle with
I always need an oil or a spray and this
is the best one I have ever tried hands
down
I've got the big size as well which I
use at home but because this just works
so well it just takes all the stress out
of washing my hair when on a holiday so
love this and probably will use this the
rest of my life because it is that good
a few beauty favorites that I wanted to
tell you about as well and firstly the
artiste brush I was not expecting to
love this as much as I do but the way
that this applies makeup I am just in
love with I love that you don't need to
apply anywhere near so much product so
if you've got a slightly more high-end
foundation then this just allows you to
get that beautiful perfect finish but
without using so much product and it
means you don't have quite such a cakey
look on your face either which I really
don't like and well I was away are you
with my Gillan Terra Cotta foundation I
think I did yes I featured this in my
get ready with us video so you can see
me actually applying my makeup with this
I have got oval six which i think is a
really practical shape and it means that
I can put my foundation on but also get
into the under eye areas into the nose
crease and also do contouring and
everything with it I tend to just use it
for foundation but have been absolutely
loving loving loving using it for that
and also quite a new favorite but one
that I've been really enjoying using for
the past a week is something from the
Estee edit now this whole makeup look is
actually with Estee edit products and I
filmed this makeup look so I'll leave a
link to that video down below but this
is the SA edit pore vanishing stick and
I've been applying this before I start
my makeup on my cheeks on my forehead
and on my chin firstly to really blur
out those pores but also it's very
mattifying so my skin as you guys know
can look very clearly and very shiny and
this somehow manages to mattify but
without making my face lose all of its
globe and for that reason I love it love
this really handy and travel sized as
well don't know how I feel about this
blue I think it's a little bit not quite
the right branding for Estee Lauder by
guess this whole range is designed for
the young audience so yeah it's it's a
very very good product this month I feel
like maybe because of my brace I've been
craving more hydrating lip products and
the one that I've been reaching for on
an everyday basis has been this one from
the Gillan Petite robe Noire range and
it's their Rouge I level it stick in
shade zero-one-one and I've talked about
this before but it's just a really
beautiful hydrating it's almost like a
bomb but it gives a beautiful soft pink
color like a lipstick and it's been just
so comfortable to wear when I've got a
mouthful of race especially this first
few days when I wasn't as comfortable
with my brace and this was just a really
really lovely luxurious but still for a
comfortable product to wear so I really
have been enjoying that along with in
the evenings and the Clarins hydro
quench lip balm I love this for
traveling because it really does just
inject your lips just so much moisture
without them getting sticky so I always
take this with me when I've been
traveling and I just use this
I think probably every evening this
month so I need to get myself in one of
these I'm almost down to the stage where
I need to start coiling it down to get
the last few bits out I've just been
loving it so much and last but not least
I have a fashion favorite and you guys
probably I'm not surprised to see this
because I'm wearing it all the time in
my snapchats and in my vlogs and I've
been getting so many tweets asking where
it's from and it's this pink a river
island belted trench coat so it's a
really beautiful color this is the kind
of color you guys know I wear all the
time it's just so mean and it's a
beautiful floaty shape I really love the
fabric it just hangs really really
beautifully you can tie it around the
waist which I find really really
flattering if I can I'll insert a video
or a photo of me wearing it but not sure
if I've got any yeah I just think this
is the most practical jacket someone
tweeted me saying that it looked like
it's perfect for all seasons and I agree
it's very light so might be needing you
might need to wear it with some jumpers
in winter but because it is very kind of
covering over the whole body I think it
will be a really lovely layering piece
it's also got these details on the arms
where it's got the buttons and this kind
of Cape detail at the back just
everything about this I absolutely love
so that's everything from me those are
my favorite products of May quite a
random selection of pieces but I hope
you guys enjoy looking through these
pieces of me let me know in the comments
