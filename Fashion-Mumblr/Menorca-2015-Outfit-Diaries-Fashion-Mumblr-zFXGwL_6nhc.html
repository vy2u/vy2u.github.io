menorca we're just exploring the old
town and currently we're in a beautiful
museum it's a really stunning old
limestone building we're just going to
explore the town and then we've got a
boat trip this afternoon so should be a
lovely day
so we've just had lunch of this really
beautiful little place down on the
seafront and then if you can see behind
me some really beautiful views so just
overlooking the harbor it's awesome to
see me but I'm not the hugest fan also
they really kinda made me a steak and
chips super English meal but now I'm on
a boat all probably gonna fall asleep
but it should be really really lovely
so we are now at the benefit of in yard
close to the center of mahon and just
try to love you white wine and now going
in to have some reading from Rosie this
is the Rina Blanco and its really really
fresh and fruity so really lovely
we just pulled up a lovely baby we'll be
jumping in by magic sausages flute easy
so we have to come to a salt farm in the
south of the island and we're seeing how
the seawater basically goes through all
these different almost black boxes in
the ground and the idea is to convert to
three percent salt in the water to 25
percent in the water which I do by
putting it in really shallow pools so
that the water can evaporate and it just
pisses on it so just seeing that this
giant sieve which disorder
so we are now just walking around you
Videla which used to be the capital of
menorca before I think it was the Roman
invasion which is walking around some
really beautiful side streets having a
little explore it's a really beautiful
old city I think I actually prefer this
to my home so yeah it's a really lovely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
