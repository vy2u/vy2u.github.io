some of these - were to tweeze snotty hi
everyone welcome back and thanks for
joining me for another haul video I hope
you're all doing really really well
today today's video is going to be a
misguided call and I'm feeling really
optimistic about this one I remember
everything that I picked on the website
I just had really good feelings about
lots of nice or tundle pieces but still
a few pastel colors so yeah really
really excited to crack open that the
bags plural I did I think it was quite a
big order I've got not one but two bags
the second one is really really happy
also I never really thought about it
before but I really like their packaging
like this pink color with random lips on
it much better than a sauce is boring
black and white one anyway so I'm not
gonna Rumble it at all because this
could be quite a long haul video so I'm
just going to get straight stuck in that
word bag number one okey okey so this is
a really thick material if I remember
correctly this is a coat and the first
thing that has jumped into my head is
this is gonna get covered in dog hairs I
have to lint roll myself like all the
time anyway and yeah I feel like this is
quite a dangerous one but it is a nice
material it's almost felt e like a
bondage felt material the longline coats
in this thick well I say thick but it's
actually not gonna be to everyone quite
a good layering piece though with this
waterfall detail on the front I don't if
it has a belt it doesn't look like it
but it is something you potentially add
a belt in yourself perhaps of gold that
would look really lovely
so I'm now gonna try it on I'm gonna
insert clip me try
on you no apologize in advance that
these are going to be filmed in a vlog
style way because yeah just takes a
really long time to film the cartels so
I'm gonna do them in my vlogging camera
and that way I can really show you the
products in detail so let's give the
coat to try to start with not gonna lie
this little white outfit is kind of
making me feel like God from Bruce
Almighty I've don't normally wear all
white but yeah you could wear obviously
other colors underneath this I do really
like the shape of this I like the
waterfall detail but I am incredibly
worried about wearing a white coat
especially on the neck because obviously
I wear makeup every day I feel like it
could be a bit of a disaster for
foundation but having said that worn
with a belts like a really big buckled
statement felt this could look really
really cool nice length as well I think
it's just gonna be nice and warm already
I'm really really warming it's pretty
cold outside today and sorry the
sunlight has just gone in but yeah quite
a nice layering piece I think if you're
tanned
this is just gonna make you look even
more tan so a really nice way to
accentuate your color during the winter
months and once again really inexpensive
so a nice little cheap layering piece
let me know if you guys don't mind that
style of trying on or otherwise if you
don't like it I'll just switch back to
the old way but that way is much much
easier for me to film the next thing I
have is I don't actually remember looks
like a blouse in this blue kind of this
print I would say it's kind of
Singaporean it just reminds me of you
know
Malaysia Malaysia that's why I bought
this I remember though so I thought this
would be a really cute dress because I
am 80 percent chance that I'm going to
Malaysia early next month so I thought
this would be really nice thing to wear
the daytime sit is long sleeve it is
quite short though so it's still I still
got to get a little bit of color on my
legs hopefully but enough of a cover up
that it's respectful
I thought the patterns were just really
really lovely a really nice holiday
piece not such a great piece for the UK
autumn but a really nice lightweight
thing that can
shoved in a suitcase if you do have any
late summer or winter Sun holidays
coming up so let's give this a try and
see how it fits this is exactly how I
was hoping it would be just such a
really lovely light fabric and so
detailed I think for my trip to Malaysia
this is going to be absolutely perfect
like imagine wearing this on an exotic
beach I think it's absolutely gorgeous
it's really lovely light materials it's
going to crush down into my suitcase
really nicely shouldn't crease badly at
all you've got these I think that silver
buttons if you wanted to make this look
a little bit more luxurious you could
always replace these with some more
detailed buttons you've got a tie
waistline so I've just like covered it
over the waist a little bit to add a
little bit more shape to it and then
it's got these ties on the sleeves so it
holds the sleeves up quite nicely
yeah collared neckline I think this is
gonna be really nice for covering up at
lunch time throwing on over a bikini
really really nice for a winter Sun
break so really glad I picked up this
one okay I don't usually order black so
that was really really strange I think I
do remember ordering it because it's a
playsuit and I think I'd put this in my
basket after I just after I just got
back from Greece and I was just really
stressed I didn't have any you know
those kind of things you don't really
need to think about you just shove them
on and you know it's gonna look good so
I think I was hoping that this would be
one of those so let's have a little look
once we've tried it on hmm I just don't
know about this one I can definitely see
that for a lot of people this would be a
really lovely Beach essential because
it's off the shoulder which is obviously
really nice in yucatan it's black which
most people find really flattering but
for me I just feel like I don't suit
black I don't know I think if this was
in white or something I would absolutely
love it because it is such lovely light
material and great to just have a
one-piece to throw on you don't have to
think about it when you're on holiday
but black just doesn't really do
anything for me I feel like it just
makes me look really not myself so
think this one is gonna go back sadly
but I definitely I don't know I mean I
really like the shape of the sleeves
you've got this would you call it
overlay fabric which goes all the way
around the sleeves as well so it's not
just on the bodice it goes over the
sleeves so yeah I do really like it um
just not the black I don't know help me
decide guys I really don't know what to
do with this one and then another black
piece this is a pair of collapse and I
feel like black culottes are a really
good work wear office or you know
smarter occasion piece to have in your
wardrobe and I just don't really see the
point of spending a fortune in callosity
it's actually really lovely quality they
seem to be made from a nice material
that's not going to crease terribly in
fact I don't think is going to crease it
at all because it has got quite a lot of
elastin in there and it's elastic so
they are going to be comfortable to wear
around the waist good for if you're
indulging in some comfort food and and
not a bad price either I think these
were like $24.99 don't think it says on
the label I picked these up in a fall
and actually because they are stretchy I
think they will fit me really really
nicely so let's get these culottes I
definitely appreciate them I can tell
that they'd be very very practical for a
lot of people like if you've got an
office job where you have to dress
really smartly I think even if you're
like a teacher or if you have to wear
like school uniform you're allowed to
wherever you want I think they would be
absolutely perfect for that but for me
personally I just don't really wear that
much black and so they're a little bit
unnecessary for me I don't really feel
like I suit black that much but as far
as culottes go these are just you know
standard qalaat say don't have any zip
on them so they're an elasticated waist
which makes them really comfortable
I think the quality of the fabric is
okay it's not going to crease bad leaks
it's fairly elasticated so yeah if
you're looking for a pair of plain back
black qalaat then I think needs a really
good value but they are just not really
for me
this next
is one of the pieces I'm most excited
about and it is a white bodysuit so
obviously I wear white tops a lot and I
pretty much always tuck my top in I
think it looks so much smarter to have
your top tucked in and this one that has
the little clips that go in the crotch
area so it will remain tucked into my
trousers no matter how much moving
around I do it's got a lovely crossover
design at the front I'm hoping it's not
going to be too low-cut because I don't
really want to have too much on display
long sleeve as well so a nice layering
piece for autumn really really looking
forward to starting this so let's try
this one on as well so I really really
really like this top I think it was so
practical the fact that it kind of tucks
in in the crotch area just means that
it's going to be really good for wearing
with jeans the only thing that I don't
like about it is this collar like it's
just a little bit pathetic it's not
really necessary in fact I might try
stitching it on the inside so that it
just stays inside the top because I
think it looks so much better without
it's just a little bit unnecessary it's
not going to be the warmest because this
fabric is actually not that thick but
having said that it could be a really
nice layering piece especially with a
nice coat over the top like the ones I'm
going to try on in a little bit for you
but I think this is kind of thing I'm
gonna wear absolutely loads I think the
black one are wear lots as well so yeah
definitely keeping this white top we're
really really pleased with this this is
gonna make the lighting of my camera go
really really really I apologize in
advance but it is this beautiful
strapless bando or Bardot jumpsuit so
it's in a dark navy color and it is
culottes so it's taken off so many
trends it's taking off the collage
around the off-the-shoulder trend and
the ruffle trend all in one I feel like
this is the kind of thing you could wear
a high-neck white top underneath
potentially one with a bit of a
detail on the neckline zip at the back
and it looks like it should be quite
figure hugging like quite 40
form-fitting again really looking
forward to trying the song I think this
could be a very elegant work wear outfit
work to bar type thing with some heels
that could look really really lovely and
I have been looking for a jumpsuit for
quite a while and didn't really want to
splash out a huge amount on them because
I know it's not the kind of thing I'll
wear tons but misguided I think they
have hit the nail on the head with this
one so let's give it a try
this is a really cool piece I'm
definitely a fan of this play suit once
again it needs an iron misguided you
need to sort out the crease ability of
your clothes but I think this will look
really really nice if you've got any
evening evening events going on perhaps
with some chunky gold jewellery because
you have got this revealed neckline I
think a chunky gold statement necklace
would look really really nice with this
doesn't have any pockets design detail
other than this beautiful fledged eat a
LAN the top it's pretty simple but I
think a very very stylish piece for the
festive season this navy color is really
good throughout winter and it does have
some nice design details like these
pleats so it's nice and figure-hugging
it's a really lovely silhouette and
obviously Klotz being one of autumns big
trends so yeah really pleased that this
one once again a really good price for
something that can be worn it to some
lovely events during the winter season
because I'm clearly obsessed with
culottes this season I also picked up a
white pair this is a different fabric to
the black pair it's almost a little bit
more denim / linen II really hard to
describe this fabric I think it's
probably just a polyester once again I
picked these up in a size 4 because I
don't know I just didn't want them to be
too big for me in any way I feel like
culottes need to be quite tight-fitting
around the waist area so I picked them
up in a size 4 hopefully they will fit
and go over my hips and they have got
little pockets on the front which is
just 8 9
design detail once again I feel like
this fabric is gonna be quite good at
not being too Creasy so fingers crossed
they will continue to look good after a
day of wearing them but let's give them
a try and see how they look on I
probably wouldn't wear the white clots
as part of an all-white outfit but just
for the sake of trying them material
wise it is not a crease free material
they have got pretty creased just being
in the box but I really really like the
fit I love that they've got this
waistband I think it's very nice and I'm
accentuating for the waistline so really
nice kind of feminine design I like the
pockets as well and it's got a zip open
and closure and the length is okay not
like I don't know I feel like because
the fabric just sits there it's quite
stiff it doesn't really have much
movement yeah I guess like with some
mules they would look pretty cool they
look nice with this kind of top maybe
even the black version this top would
look really nice with these I think once
they are ironed they could be quite a
nice collage staple and really not that
expensive so quite a nice way to
affordably bring some clots into your
wardrobe because I think that colet's
are going to remain in style for a
little bit longer okay this next one I
am really really excited about it is
such a good tube and it is this crochet
bikini which obviously looks pretty much
identical to the super expensive kini
bikinis which are all over Instagram I
can't believe it in do these sooner or
maybe they didn't I just didn't see them
but I think this is just gorgeous I'm
really really hoping this is going to
fit because I think it's such a lovely
style of bikini just so good in photos
they look great on Instagram so yeah I'm
really really hoping this is going to
look good I'm gonna apologize if I don't
show my triangle clip for very long
because I'm not bikini ready at the
moment and the bottoms textures
mr. wrestling the bottoms they look
quite big on the bottoms they're not
going to be the most bum flattering ones
but because they do have just the
crochet on the sides they should be
pretty good for tanning and they are
fairly elastic which means those should
be nice to put on off I didn't try a
cheap ropes and the tip - a teeny bikini
in the past from eBay and it just had no
lastest units so really hard to get on
whereas these feel like they will be
easier to get on they don't have any
fastenings that's something to notice
the back is simply elastic so you just
have to show it on over your head but
yeah really excited to try this on and
hopefully will be a good one for me to
take with me on my trip next month do
this thing in the background the next
thing that I've picked up is a clutch
bag and this it once again is clearly
inspired by the Chloe Fay bag and I
really don't mind
things that are designer inspired I
think it's such a nice way of buying
into the trends especially when you see
them all over Instagram you fall in love
but your purse may not allow for the
full priced designer item so this one is
a beautiful blush pink clutch bag with
this ring here which is very reminiscent
of a Chloe bag suede esque top and then
leather esque bottom the price tag tells
me that they're not real suede and
leather and then inside you know what
this wood makes such a cute little bag
for school or work but you're if you've
got one of those really small MacBooks
you could put a Macbook in there or your
iPad and a notebook and so you've got
these departments compartments inside a
very thin one in the middle then you've
got a back section
zipper pocket and front section with a
fabric pocket as well and then I guess
you just it has got a magnetic clasp
there also you can just you know be
quite rough with the string personally
don't you see the point of the string
but it is my next design detail I wish I
had a shoulder strap in fact it's
something oh hold on there's a there's a
loop in there so maybe it does have a
strap let's have a look inside yeah
amazing because sometimes I just don't
like carrying crutch bags and it does
have a metal chain inside it's got to be
really careful with your silicone bags
because I don't want Dexter showing them
so yeah it does have a chain on the
inside a cart member with the chain
handle for the Chloe bag looks like and
I think it's as plain as this but either
way this is just absolutely beautiful
and I'm really excited to start this up
with you outfits and all of that was
only the first bag so hopefully the
second bag will be just as successful
because I feel like there was some
really really good bits in there so
let's have a little look in bag number
two this is so weird
but I just got like a moment of stage
fright like I never really think when
I'm filming how many people are gonna
watch these videos like this video could
randomly do really well and get like
50,000 views or something and the fact
that 50,000 people are watching what I'm
doing like right now in my living room
opening up my shopping bags that's a bit
scary it just had that like mad moment
anyway you can all me I'll just carry on
as though I thought it's not in my head
right now okay I like the lip of this
it's another coat and it is in this
blush pink color which you guys know I
adore I think it's very similar if not
the same style as the white one I showed
you at the very beginning but this blush
pink is a little bit more me and a bit
more practical
it does feel slightly higher quality as
well I picked up a size four because it
did say oversized on the website and I
didn't want to completely swamped myself
I mean design wise this is just really
really basic it's it is finished
it's not real cut it's got the waterfall
detail but I mean it doesn't even have
pockets it doesn't even have a belt so
misguided are just raking it in and
thereby cutting out a piece of what is
essentially felt in a clothing style
design so very very clever retailers but
this could be a really nice layering
piece so even though I know no matter
what I'm paying for it it probably cost
about three pounds to produce I'm gonna
try it on anyway and not let that put me
off because that is the clothing
industry for you but yeah I do like to
look at this so let's give it a try so
this is definitely the best misguided
coat that I've tried in quite some time
I actually wore it since filming the
first part of this haul and this part of
the haul so I'll insert a little clip of
me wearing it in action but really like
how this falls I really like the color I
like the waterfall at Fort wall with a I
like the waterfall
neckline yeah I think it could look
really nice with a belt as well so maybe
one oversize belt would look really nice
just to bring a little bit of shape into
this I think for 35 pounds this is just
really really nice it's a lovely long
material it's just so cozy as well it's
kind of like wearing your dressing-gown
out the house and the final thing is
another coat so luckily for the length
of this video's sake there are only two
things in that last parcel and this is
another coat once again I picked up a
size 4 but this one is much more
designed if that makes sense so this one
has a lining you learned in have a
lining and it is a silky polyester
material also did I mention I've got
this in a size 4 same blush material
it's more of a smart collar neckline
whereas the other one is a waterfall
detail it's lined all the way down to
the sleeves it does not have a belt but
it does have pockets although they're
faux pockets I know they're not a real
pockets I just need unstitching and so
this one will be quite a lot warmer the
quality of the fabric is much better
it's still not super high but if you saw
my previous misguided hauls you'll know
that I was really annoyed by the duster
coats because they crinkled so badly
they creased really badly and I did
ended up saying
all of them back because I just can't
deal with stuff that's gonna look poor
quality when I wear it that's them
that's definitely not what I want to
fill my wardrobe with so I've got high
hopes for this one hopefully it's not
going to be too big and boxy on me
because I am fairly petite frame wise so
I don't like things just want for me so
let's give this a try and see how it
looks so this I am very very impressed
with I was expecting this to be really
big and boxy and does not fit me very
well at all
but I am pleasantly surprised that
actually it fits me on the shoulders
really nicely and it could do with a
steam that's the only annoying thing it
does definitely need an iron I think
this in a camel color could look like a
really lovely classic piece doesn't have
any buttons on it which I guess you know
it's just meant to be worn quite loosely
it's got pockets which I do really
really like I think once it's esteemed
it could look really lovely and it is
lined as I mention so better quality
than the previous ones so yeah I think
this is definitely a keeper what do you
guys think I really like the color of
this one
and it does feel warm maybe not warm
enough for like deepest darkest winter
but I think for this time of year when
you just want to add a layering piece
into your wardrobe this could be a
really nice one just imagine how nice it
will look when it doesn't have creases
all over it I think it could look pretty
nice and that's everything that I picked
up from misguided guys in my October
haul I feel like there's a lot of really
really lovely pieces here probably my
favorite misguided haul that I have done
so far really really impressed not any
pieces actually that I've looked at and
thought crap quality so yeah well the
