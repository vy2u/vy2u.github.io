joining me for today's video which is
going to be a very old terminal video
all about the kind of things that I love
during these cooler or two months so
whether that's things that I like to eat
or like to use or just like to enjoy
it's going to be pretty much my favorite
autumn things autumn obsessions that
kind of thing so I really hope that you
guys are feeling really snugly maybe
you're in bed with the duvet wrapped
around you or you've got a super soft
dress and gown on I like to think that
that's how you guys are watching this
video just like me all bundled up with a
hot drink I've got a coffee and because
it's two o'clock in the afternoon and I
need the hit of the caffeine if you've
got a lovely snuggly warm drink with you
to keep you going throughout the rest of
this video and I am going to get started
by talking about a few fashion pieces
which I just love to wear in the autumn
season so as you can probably imagine
autumn for me is all about being warm
and cozy so soft fabrics and warmth are
very very high up my agenda in autumn so
for that reason the first thing I wanted
to mention within this video is cozy
jumpers and knitwear so first of all
this one that I'm wearing right now this
is actually quite an old one from
Topshop I think it's a couple of years
old but I reach for it season after
season because I just love the high neck
high necks in autumn and winter on my
favorite thing they're so warm and
snuggly you really don't get any cold
air going onto your chest which is just
so so nice and you can wear thermals
underneath it I wish I had a pound for
every time I bought a piece of clothing
because I can fit them on underneath bit
more on those later and so yeah it's
something that is high-neck long-sleeve
and just made from a really nice
material potentially preferably a
brushed material so it's lovely and soft
on the skin
Topshop have loads of really really nice
ones but if you want to splash out just
a tiny bit more and really invest in a
key piece for your autumn wardrobe this
is a current favorite from Club Monaco I
actually featured this and a few other
all tunnel investment pieces in a recent
kind of premium high street haul so if
you want to see a few more of my key
autumn my investment
he says I'll leave that video linked
down below but this is a cashmere jumper
it's high neck it's so so so soft and
just a classic piece so something that I
didn't really mind splashing out a
little bit more on because it is such a
classic piece so warm and snuggly and
definitely going to be an essential for
this autumn and many many autumns to
come so from being warm cozy and
fashionable outside the house of course
during autumn I love to be cozy inside
the house too
so my next essential is actually a pair
of slippers and I wear slippers I'd say
I went every single day but especially
on my working from home days I wear them
all day every day so I just actually had
to include these this pair in particular
is from a brand called mohabbat and it's
I think it's an American brand Oh
designed in London okay I like it even
more now that I know that it's designed
in London so these Mojave slippers are
very different to any other slippers
that I've ever had before because they
are indoor/outdoor slippers so I
personally find this incredibly useful
because I'm always like - into the shops
across the roads get milk or something
or going out into the garden to chase
after Dexter or clear up after him if
you know what I'm saying so the fact
that these have a removable sole there
is a pressed it on the top people to
just pick open and then this is a sole
which you can just take off really
really easily she says her go yes then
when you are inside they're just as
beautiful simple design with a non-slip
sole and then when you want to go
outside you can just quickly clip on the
rubber sole which is so so so handy and
when you're inside the house they are
the most comfortable things in the whole
world
they've got sheepskin lining which is
really breathable but also keeps your
feet nice and warm and snuggly and the
sole is just super comfortable as well
I'm not sure it's like memory foam but
it's definitely more protective than and
normal slipper sole so because I wear
slippers so so so much it's definitely
something that I like to invest in in
the autumn season and these are my
current favorite pair so comfy they look
really stylish as well I think I prefer
how they look without the sole on them
but they're just really simple really
sleek and kind
well I'm sure if Charlie could fit into
these he would definitely steal them
from me I might actually get him a pair
for Christmas because he has slipper
Envy when I wear these so yeah these are
very well loved autumn essential and
definitely something that has been
keeping me nice and snuggly for the past
few weeks and months next I cannot do an
autumn essentials without talking about
my thermals and I can't believe it one
of you guys actually asked me to talk
about thermals in a video because I
mentioned them so much in a recent haul
but I wear thermals under everything
like literally the only reason why I
don't have one on today is because I'm
at home and pretty warm in this house
especially with the light behind the
camera so that's the only reason why I
don't have one on right now but if you
ever like to see me in the street in
autumn or winter then just come up to me
and ask if I'm wearing a thermal I will
think you're a little bit crazy but I
won't mind I'll just show you I will
probably have a thermal on and I get my
thermals from Marks &amp;amp; Spencer I don't
care if you think I'm a granny because
they are the best things in the world
this one is a shitty one it's a little
bit thicker material but the ones that I
really really love these ones excuse the
fact that it's not like brand new out
the packaging but I get a lot of use out
of these so these ones are the scoop
neck long-sleeve versions so they that's
why I need to have like high neck and
long sleeves on my jumpers so that you
can't see my thermal sneaking through I
have tons of these I have plain white
ones plain black ones patterned ones
gray ones multicolored ones I have so so
so many of these thermals they are ultra
light weights this material you cannot
see it through your clothing it doesn't
add any bulk
whereas this style is a little bit
thicker so it does that a bit of bulk
but it's just like an invisible layer
which keeps you warm and temperature
regulates so a really wonderful thing to
put on underneath your clothing during
the colder seasons especially when I'm
skiing or if I'm standing watching
Charlie play rugby on the sidelines and
getting a bit cold these are just so
perfect for keeping your body warm so if
you suffer from the cold then I highly
recommend going to Marks &amp;amp; Spencer's and
investing in a few thermals they have
loads and loads of really nice designs
if you're a smaller size I try to pick
up size six they do sell out quite quick
but I will leave some links below to
where you can get these and the exact
ones that I like I will leave links
below to absolutely everything in this
video but I have had a few thermal
requests so yeah everything will be down
below so now moving from fashion to
beauty and I'm not going to go into a
full like Ottoman PT routine because you
guys have seen that before on my channel
and that would be just a whole hour long
video by itself so I'm going to talk
about the slightly more unusual parts of
my autumn beauty routine or favorite
pieces of my autumn routine and firstly
is hand cream and I have a couple of
options here a high-end version and a
more affordable version minute so I love
hand cream all year round but especially
during the cooler months because sorry I
think I've got like this cashmere or
something like a fiber attached to my
face um yeah so I see love hand cream
when it starts to get a bit cooler
because I do suffer from dry hands and
is just a really lovely luxurious thing
to do keeps your hands smelling and
feeling really really lovely
so my drugstore or affordable version is
the Vaseline intensive care one and just
surrounded on the floor I chose this one
because even though it is affordable
it's non greasy I find a lot of cheap
ones you use them and you kind of have
to sit there massaging your hands for
about 10 minutes numerous certainly
couldn't like type on your phone or use
your keyboard or do anything productive
for a good 10 minutes after applying it
but this one you just put it on it's
very very lightly fragrant so not really
not really one to use if you want to
have nice smelling hands it just just
feels nice and after a few moments my
hands feel completely dry they don't
have any greasy residue on them and the
great thing about this hand cream as
well as being moisturizing is it's also
antibacterial so a really good
two-in-one and I've never actually heard
of another antibacterial hand cream like
one that is anti back and moisturizing
so I've really been enjoying using this
one but if your budget does stretch to
it and you want to treat yourself
something
little bit more luxurious I am totally
obsessed actually obsessed with this new
one from Germany and it's their geranium
and walnut hankering and I can't even
you as soon as I tried it that it was
going to be a favorite German oh and
truly can do no wrong when it comes to
their fragrances and this hand cream is
no different it smells so comforting I
think it's the walnut scent I didn't
really recognize the scent at first but
there's something really warm and
comforting about it once again it does
not add any grease to your hands it
sinks in straightaway but it definitely
feels a lot more luxurious than
obviously the Vaseline one the price
does reflect but it feels a lot more of
serious and my hands just feels so
lovely and soft after I apply it and
they smell good they remain hydrated for
a long time they basically take some
loads and negative boxes I think it's a
fabulous and gift I think this would
just be such a gorgeous stocking filler
a very generous stocking filler and but
also something to treat yourself to it's
the kind of thing you only need a small
amount so in my opinion it is worth the
investment so if you do have the budget
for a luxury hand cream then look no
further than Joe Malone and their
trainee man walnut cannot recommend it
enough this scent I wish you guys could
smell it on my hands it smells so so so
good okay so as well as hand cream
something else that I absolutely love to
treat myself to during the autumn months
is a really thick rich luxurious body
butter and I say body butter because it
is just one step above a body lotion and
I cannot believe it but I have not tried
the iconic Kiehl's creme de corpse until
like two and a half weeks ago and
honestly it is a game-changer I can so
see why this is such a cult product I
have this festive Edition tub I think
this is coming out not sure this out yet
but I will leave the information down
below this is the limited edition
Christmas one and it was the first one
that I'd ever tried it is so luxurious
you can kind of see the color in here it
reminds me of icing sugar I'm just gonna
put that down I don't want to drop it in
you lose any it reminds me of ya cake
icing but the consistency is so rich so
luxurious and it's the smell that kind
of is the icing on the cake for me
literally the icing on the cake because
it smells so
and almonds remind me of marzipan
marzipan reminds me of Christmas so the
scent association with this is just
amazing I'd say that a little does go a
long way that tiny tiny amount that I
just put on is pretty much enough for my
entire forearm so a really lovely
luxurious one to use during the cooler
months another autumn obsession of mine
is a lovely luxurious cream cleanser and
the one that I have here is the creme de
beautÃ© 8 from Galan this is a very
luxurious product I'm not saying you how
to go out and smash this kind of money
but if it is in your price range then
this is one that I do highly highly
recommend I tried this out in a vlog
recently you guys might have seen me
using as parts of a very luxurious
evening routine and but this is a cream
cleanser you almost don't want to wash
it off your face because it's so
luxurious I actually like to use a nice
little water and then slow this on my
face leave it for a few minutes so my
skin can just enjoy its beautiful
nourishing formula and then use a warm
flannel to take it off and it is so so
luxurious even just looking at it you
can tell there it's a beautiful thick
and just I don't know what how was the
describe it other than luxurious it's
just such an opulent formula it really
does feel like a nourishing your skin
it's smells so good and it just feels
really comforting it feels like you're
really treating and pampering your skin
and actually all you're doing is taking
your makeup off so it's something like
that I just love to use in autumn
evenings as well as that I love
nourishing face masks there is one in
the same range from Gillan but I also
love the one from the body shop I think
it's the is it not on the zone Ian clay
Ethiopian honey I think it's Ethiopian
honey and in fact I might even have in
the same vlog that's when I spoke about
this good on one but yeah anything
nourishing for the skin I absolutely
love whether it's my cleanser stuffing
at my moisturizer or using a nourishing
face mask
treating my skin after a day out in the
biting cold is just such a lovely thing
to do on an autumn evening and when I am
having these lovely autumnal pamper
evenings of course they would not be
complete without a candle as you can
tell I'm quite a fan of candles and as
basic blogger cliche it might be don't
really care because can
our life when it comes to autumn they
are just the most perfect thing at
creating a beautiful ambience in the
room the lighting the fragrance is just
instantly such a beautiful cozy room
when you light a few candles I haven't
actually used this one yet but I wanted
to show it to you in all its beautiful
untouched glory this is the diptych
leroy sapa candle i hope i pronounced
that right a little boy's supper lunch
okay I probably should not do French
accents and but I pick this on up
because it smells so good once again I
wish this lets smellivision and you
could smell it but this is a very
comforting the fragrance on dipti
candles is so so strong you almost don't
even need to light them I just have this
one on the side in the spare bedroom
upstairs and it already even without
being lit fragrance out the entire room
that's how strong this smells when they
are lit same with Joe Malone and a few
other higher-end candles they just
instantly fill the room with such a
gorgeous fragrance I absolutely love
lighting candles when I have births or
in China Ida's relaxing here in the
lounge in the evenings they're just such
an autumn essential for me and you don't
even have to spend a fortune I actually
really like the hmm ones in fact this
orange one behind me is from hmm doesn't
smell any I didn't hear as good as these
but it looks great and it does have a
very gentle subtle fragrance also
Primark are pretty good candles too but
once again if your budget does allow for
it then the diptych ones are absolutely
heavenly
and then last but not least I wanted to
just mention a couple of food favorites
when it comes to autumn and of course
you guys know that my number one autumn
comfort food is macaroni cheese I am the
queen of mac and cheese I think my
recipe is the best in the whole world I
actually you've logged last year my
macaroni cheese recipe so I'll leave
that vlog down below I think it was a
what I eat in a day video and so yeah if
you want to see how I make my mac and
cheese and check out that video but for
me macaroni cheese is my ultimate autumn
comfort food no matter if I had to get
in a bikini the very next day I still
would not be able to resist and I can
cheese it is definitely my weakness love
love love love mac and cheese so much
but other than that I also wanted to
mention a lot less
terrific version of a autumn
comfort-food this is the life changing
spicy tomato soup from Madeline Chile's
ready steady glow book I have just been
so obsessed with using this book
recently it has changed the way that I
eat in so many ways it's made me realize
I actually really really like healthy
food and also it's very quick and easy
to prepare this soup in particular so so
so quick you literally shove a can of
chopped tomatoes a can of coconut milk
and what else is there a little bit of
paprika cumin almond butter tomato puree
a little bit of spring onion all in the
blender that's all you do just stick it
all in the blender and whizz it up
Madeline actually recommends having it
cold but I like to just put it on the
home for a few minutes get some nice
sourdough bread and for me that is the
best autumn comfort food this recipe in
particular is just so tasty without a
doubt the best tomato soup recipe I've
ever had the best tomato soup I've ever
tried in my whole life and so easy to
make and it's so nice when you know that
you've made it yourself as well just so
much more satisfying than opening up a
can of Heinz so thank you Madeline for
introducing me to that recipe it most
definitely is life-changing because I
will never buy a can of tomato soup ever
again so I've spoken about my autumn
