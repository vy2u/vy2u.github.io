my everyday hair routine and so I start
off the day with my hair in a bun so I'm
just gonna let this all out just running
my hands through my hair and as you can
see it's quite the luminous quite poufy
but not too bad so I'm just gonna run my
hands through that and then I'm gonna
brush it through with a hair brush and
I'm using my GHD hair brush this one has
really nice bristles which don't damage
the hair so I always use this one first
thing in the mornings then I'm going to
add a little bit of heat protection
using the GHD heat protection mist and
I'm not being too liberal with that just
running it into the ends and then
brushing through my hair again then I'm
going to create a middle parting using a
like home for that and then brushing the
hair through again so I've separated my
hair into two halves and I've switched
on my GHD as those curling irons and
then I'm taking a small section of hair
at a time bending it round and just
curling it as usual
so I'm going to continue doing this same
routine throughout the rest of my hair
I'm really not too precise when it comes
to my everyday hair because at the end
of this I'm just gonna be making them
big and voluminous afterwards so perfect
curls really aren't necessary but
usually I run the straighteners down the
hair and then when I get to about 1/3
from the end I start to twist away from
my face to just add that loose curl in
the end and as you can see I'm just
repeating this all the way around my
head I don't even bother to separate my
hair usually just because I'm lazy and I
find it works just as well this way so
the second half of my hair is a little
bit more tricky sometimes I hold that
hair that's on my head in my mouth but
today I thought I would put it on my
head and then just repeating the same
process around the other side of my head
I always tend to go back over the curl
and twist it again with my fingers and
just as it's cooling and I find this
makes the curls last a little bit longer
so that's a good little trick
and then again just taking section by
section you can see each section is
about an inch thick I find this is the
most I can get away with as
straighteners do go up to I think it's
180 degrees which is the perfect
temperature for Cali and straightening
but I find that anymore and my hair
doesn't take to the curl quite so well
so just repeating this all through my
head and occasionally I do alternate the
way that I straighten my hair like the
angle that I hold the straighteners
because then it stops the curls from all
grouping together you can see here I'm
flipping it around and that's so that
the curls don't all bunched together so
then I'm switching off my straighteners
and I'm going out with some dry shampoo
and this is the first thing that really
does help to build in some more volume
I'm just using a collab one and putting
that all through the roots and then
running through the curls with my
fingers you can see they're not too
perfect which is absolutely fine for my
everyday hairstyle and then I'm just
smoothing out the ends using a show
Beauty hair oil I love the smell of this
one I love the packaging and it really
helps to create some nice shine to my
hair which is quite rare for blonde hair
but as you can see it does look quite
shiny here then I'm adding more volume
by flipping my head upside down running
my fingers through my hair and then just
kind of bouncing it with my fingers so
here we go this is what the finished
look looks like it's just very big not
too perfect I just like it to look
pretty natural and most days I just
leave it like that but no we're not done
here there are more things you can do if
you want to switch up this hairstyle I'm
just adding in a little bit of holding
spray to keep that shape in there and
then I'm taking a fine-tooth comb and
brushing through the curls this helps to
loosen them and I think it gives them
more of like a Hollywood curl effect
which I really really love and if I'm
going out the house and maybe doing some
photos or doing a video then I'll
normally brush through them like this
that's it from me I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video thumbs up and
subscribe if you did and I'll see you
next time
