much for joining me for today's video
which is going to be all about eyebrows
so I'm going to be sharing with you a
few of my thoughts and tips on brow
preparation so how I like to keep my
eyebrows boomed and looking good just
all year round basically I'm also going
to talk you through my everyday brow
routine which is the kind of brows that
I wear on a day-to-day basis with my
everyday makeup look and then I thought
I would also share with you a more bold
brow look for those evenings or days
when I just want to have a little bit
more drama in my eyebrows this week
marks the start of brow week at the
boots Emporium which is a new concept
rolling across loads of boot stores all
around the country the Emporium is going
to be launching across 30 flagship
stores but there'll be experiences and
services across loads of other stores
across the country as well just in case
you didn't want to pop into a store if
there isn't one near you there's also
going to be loads on the boots website
online such as how to's tutorials tips
and lots of information on how you can
get the latest looks I'm actually going
to be visiting a Boots Emporium next
week so keep a look out for the vlog but
to give you some ideas of what you can
expect in the emporiums there's
basically personalization stations so
you can get things like your makeup
brushes and your makeup bags
personalized you can create your own
beauty boxes and there's just going to
be loads of fun things going on in store
so definitely check out my blog when
that's up and if you can't get to one of
the stores then definitely try to check
out the boots Emporium so you guys have
followed me on a little bit of a brow
journey since I've started YouTube you
know that my brows have not typically
been the kind of thing that I'm really
that proud of but I have got into a bit
of a routine with my eyebrows especially
when it comes to everyday makeup first
of all I'm going to talk about brow
preparation for me the key to getting a
good brow whether that's for an everyday
makeup look all a more bold dramatic
look is good preparation and it's not
just brows skin care hair care
everything just seems to work so much
better if you have prepared properly so
there are a couple of favorite products
they have here from boots which are
really fantastic
at preparing your brows first of all is
is dive route and you probably recognize
this from my snapchat because I pretty
much always snapchat when I use this
because I can't get enough of it it's so
simple to do at home and it's definitely
not something to be scared of personally
I don't really like the idea of dyeing
my hair is in my actual hair at home but
eyebrows it's just so quick and easy and
you save a fortune from doing it in the
sounds as well so this kit you mix at
home you just mix the two solutions
together pop it on your eyebrows for a
minute or so depending on how dark you
want the color to go and then use a damp
cotton cloth to just remove it it's as
simple as that so if like me you have
light-colored brow hair then this is
really great at picking up any extra
hairs I always used to think that my
brows are really gappy and I didn't
really have any brow hairs in the middle
section but as soon as I started to dye
my own eyebrows I noticed that actually
there were hairs there and they were
just really fine so it makes my brows a
lot easier to shave and just a lot
bigger and better when I use the diver
alket once you got a beautiful color the
next thing to do is shape your brows
personally I like to do a mixture
between waxing and threading I don't
really have a preference but what I do
know is that upkeep is really essential
which is why I've picked up one of these
sets and it's the eyebrow shaping kit
and it's a boots own brand so that
wasn't very expensive at all inside
you've got everything you need for
shaping even if you do get your brows
done professionally it's always a good
idea to have these essential tools just
for those broad topics so inside you've
got some slanted brow shaping scissors
you've got two different types of
tweezers so it can be really precise
there getting those hard to get and has
and also a spoolie for just combing
through the brows and you've even got
some stencils as well so everything you
need for creating the perfect brow shape
all in one handy kit this is just such a
convenient thing to have in your draw
because you never know when a four hour
emergency maid strikes they're a really
handy thing to keep in your makeup
collection okay so I've moved you in a
little bit closer because next I'm going
to talk you through my everyday brow
routine so as you probably know if
you've watched a few of my tutorials in
the past my brows are usually the stage
that I complete after finishing off my
base so already this morning
I've applied a little bit of concealer
to my blemishes I seem to have a few at
the moment I think it's just this busy
time of year so first of all I applied
some creamy concealer and then a really
lovely light foundation for a beautiful
glowy everyday look which you guys know
I'm all about that really fresh makeup
look then I applied some lightening
concealer underneath the eyes just to
brighten and get rid of any of those
pesky eye bags and then I've set the
entire base using a loose powder and my
trusty Real Techniques makeup brush
focusing on the under eye area and then
any areas where my makeup tends to slide
around such as on my chin my t-zone at
my forehead for my everyday brow look I
actually only need two products the
first of which is the soap &amp;amp; Glory arc
de triomph brow pencil I absolutely love
this one because it's such a good
multitasker it means you don't need to
carry so much in your makeup bag it
contains a colored pencil at the top
which is great for filling in any areas
where you may have less brow hair any
sparse areas and it's also got a
highlighting pencil underneath I don't
use this every single day but I will use
it today just to give you guys an idea
of how it looks it's a really beautiful
subtle sheen which helps to lift at the
eyebrow and give a really beautiful
flattering look I then add a little bit
more volume and set my brows using the
infamous benefit gimme brow
I'm absolutely obsessed with this new
packaging it's so cute and this is a
product I've been using for many many
years
I even back comb my eyebrows with this
when I want a little bit more drama so
my first tip would be to make sure that
your brow pencil whichever you're using
is really really sharp personally I like
to replicate the look of actual brow
hairs when I'm drawing in with my brow
pencil so a sharp pencil is key to
achieving this look because I've already
shaped my brows I'm just going to be
following the natural brow shape not
really going too far beyond the natural
arch of the brows I'm just keeping it
really natural for today's everyday look
and I'm going to use really lovely
feathers soft light strokes to create a
really beautiful soft brown shade so I'm
starting off here in the inner part of
my eyebrow and because my brows are a
little bit more gapi here I'm actually
going to essentially draw in
brow hair using really soft movements
with the pencil because it's nice and
sharp they really do look almost
hairlike which is exactly the look I'm
going for so you can see this is the
brow that I've filled in the first part
here compared to the natural brow it's
really just defined that brow shape and
added in some volume and some brow where
I really needed it the most now I'm
going to continue using that really soft
almost flicking motion throughout the
rest of my brows if your brows aren't in
such a defined shape you could start by
outlining the brows just really really
lightly but personally I'm just going to
do this along the bottom just slightly
drawing in a very very soft line where
the brow actually finishes you can see
that helps to create just a tiny bit of
definition without being too bold and
then you can use this as a template just
to work upwards into the brow hair so
you can see I'm just following the
natural brow shape not really going too
far beyond the actual for our boundaries
okay I'm really pleased with this brow
shape and now I'm going to move on to
the next eyebrow as you guys know brows
are meant to be sisters and not twins so
don't spend ages worrying about getting
them absolutely identical because that
wouldn't really look natural anyway so
following the same technique I'm going
to do the second eyebrow
next I'm going to set my brows as well
as adding a little bit of volume using
the benefit gimme brow so starting in
the middle once again I'm using the
applicator almost like a comb to brush
through the brows flicking the brow hair
upwards towards my hairline and then
working my way into the tail of the
eyebrow repeating this on the other side
this helps to add just a little bit more
color and volume into the brows as well
as setting the hairs in place for the
rest of the day so that's the brows
shaped and colored and set and to be
honest most days I leave it at this my
brows really don't take me too long at
all but I do credit that to good brow
preparation so this is my everyday brow
look but if I want to do something a
little bit more snazzy then I like to
add a tiny bit of highlighter as I
mentioned earlier my Arc de Triomphe
pencil has a highlighter and the brow
coloring pencil in one so what I'm going
to do is just really lightly draw
underneath the arch of my brow to really
elevate the tail of the eyebrow this is
a really lovely creamy pencil so you
don't need to worry about it dragging on
the sensitive skin either and because
this brow pencil doesn't contain any
shimmer it's just a really lovely light
color it makes it perfect for an
everyday brow look so I've drawn in a
little line using the pencil and now I'm
just going to use my finger and patting
motions to blend that in
so as you can see it's just a very very
subtle beautiful way of elevating your
eyebrow and creating a more flattering
shape on the face out so you love this
look actually I feel like I'm going to
use this a lot more on everyday basis
and not just save it for special
occasions because it really is very
subtle and beautiful now it's time to
complete the look because I've gone for
a really beautiful natural brow I'm not
going to go too bold on the eye makeup
so I'm taking the new Rimmel magnifies
palette and I'm going to use one of the
softer more natural matte shades just to
sweep a single color over the eyelid I'm
going to use this almost mushroomy light
brown shade just the one color and I'm
going to sweep this all over the lid
so this eyeshadow is almost your skin
but better it's a very beautiful natural
color so great for an everyday makeup
look next I'm going to apply some
mascara and I absolutely love brown
mascara as a blonde I find it a little
bit softer and better for an everyday
natural makeup look so I was so thrilled
to find out recently the benefit have
released my all-time favorite mascara
roller lash in brown so I'm going to use
this today for this makeup look because
it's roller lash and it just creates the
most beautiful curled lashes thanks to
the innovative comb I'm not even going
to bother curling my lashes with eyelash
curlers I'm just going to go straight in
with mascara I like to we call the comb
quite close to the base of my lashes
because I'm not using eyeliner this just
helps to create a little bit more
definition and if you were to flick it
on the ends alone so there we have it a
really beautiful natural eye look the
eye shadow and mascara really doesn't
overpower the eye area and that really
suits the natural eye brows that we've
gone for today the final touch is just a
little bit of lip balm and I really like
these new L'Oreal sexy balms not a fan
of the name but a big fan of the
consistency and how they look on the
lips
I did apply some earlier but it's about
time I topped up and this is a shade 102
sheer gossip and I find it reflashing
uncomfortable for an everyday natural
makeup look
and we are done
you guys probably recognize this look
because this is my everyday natural
makeup look I'd say I wear this
most days I often add to it in the
evenings to make a little bit more
dramatic but the products they switch
around a little bit but it's mostly the
same routine every single day next I'm
going to show you how I create some more
bold and dramatic brow look when I wear
a slightly more intense eye shadow look
or perhaps I want to go a little bit
more bold in my mascara that's when I
need my eyebrows to match but it's
usually in the evenings or if I have
perhaps a day where I know this going to
lots of photos taken I spend a little
bit longer my brows to create a really
bold defined brow look I'm just going to
brush through my brows using the sweep
from the eyebrow shaping kit just to
remove the excess product from the brow
look that I showed you a second ago also
if you overdo your brows or perhaps you
want them to be even more
natural-looking just combing through is
a really nice way of removing excess
product so to create my bold brow look
I'm going to use a few additional
products the first one that I wanted to
share with you is the brows that brow
kit from seventeen because this is an
incredible very affordable kit that has
everything you need for really beautiful
bold brow look so we've got a wax which
is used for shaping and setting the brow
hair and then a powder to set the wax
and also a highlighter to place
underneath the brow bone for a really
flattering elevated brow look you've
also got a makeup brush here which you
can use to apply the products and a
pencil for creating this very fine
actual hair like strokes another brow
favorite of mine which I'm going to use
for this look is Cobra from benefit this
again is a new launch from the brand and
I'm absolutely obsessed with it it's
really good for very long lasting brows
the packaging is really cute as well
you've got the brush in the top here and
then you unscrew to reveal the Moosey
tag
inside so I'm going to start by using
Cabral because this is a little bit
closer to my natural brow shade I always
think if in doubt go a little bit
lighter because these are really easily
blendable I'm going to use the brush
that comes with Cabral taking a little
bit of the product onto the brush and
then warming it on the back of my hand
I find this just helps it glide onto the
skin a little bit more smoothly than if
you to apply it straight onto the skin
first I need to define the brow shapes
I'm actually going to go along the whole
outline underneath the brow just as
almost a stencil that I can follow when
filling in the brows later on so I'm
using really really light strokes
because the color payoff is pretty good
on these products and just following the
brows and natural shape again going back
to the back of my hand to pick up more
product and then outlining underneath
the bottom of the brow at this stage if
you do notice any brow hairs underneath
this line you can just take your
tweezers and pluck them out gently next
I'm going to apply a little bit more
product onto the back of my hand and
then following the shape I've just
created I'm going to really lightly
feather it through the brow hair I never
go for a terribly dark bold look but
this just helps to really create a more
perfected shape while keeping that
natural brow shape so I'm just flicking
the brush through my brows and you can
see that this is really adding a lot
more color and definition to the brows
the product also sets the brow hair a
little bit so it helps to keep them in
situation all day long if you make any
mistakes it doesn't set straight away so
you can just wipe it away with your
finger to ensure you always have that
beautiful perfect shape when you finish
this part of the brows make sure you
clear the excess product off your little
brush because otherwise it's stiffens
making it really difficult to use it
next time so I just like to almost
scrape it off using my thumbnail onto my
fingers and then make sure I wash my
hands otherwise your brush is gonna get
really stiff and you're going to have to
chuck it out before too long so always
clean it after every single use before
this sets which it kind of does set it
does happen after a little while I'm
going to brush through the brows just to
make sure the shape is absolutely
perfect and there's no product buildup
again using
spooley from the brow kit next to add a
little bit more depth to the color and
also to set the car brow in place I'm
going to use the brow powder from the 17
kit so I'm taking the brush from the kit
and just making sure that I've got a
really nice coverage of the powder on
the brush and then I'm just gonna
lightly feather this all over the brows
once again try to follow the natural
direction of the brow hair because this
will just make sure that your brows are
looking still nice and neat and tidy you
can see that as well as almost
mattifying the brows this is adding even
more color so perfect way of building up
your brows for an even more bold look
try not to go out of the shape though
because this will be quite obvious
seeing as you've created a really
perfect shape with the corral so now
that I'm really happy with the shape and
the color of my brows I'm going to set
the actual hairs in place using the
nooks control-freak brow gel what I
absolutely love about boots is that they
sell all these amazing brands such as
nooks and even if there's not a store
that stops them near to you I actually
ordered this one from a smaller store
just with one of the in-store staff they
had an iPad and then they got it
delivered the very next day to my local
store it's a really good way of getting
your hands on those more in use of
makeup products so this is a clear brow
gel so it's not going to upset any of
the color that I've just spent time
perfecting but instead it's just gonna
make sure that my brow has to stay in
place all day long so just like a clear
mascara I'm brushing it through my brows
and making sure that I'm really happy
with how the hairs are setting
the last step is to highlight underneath
my brow bone I'm going to use infants
again the tool from my eyebrow shaping
kit just to pick up a little bit of the
highlighter from the 17 kit
unlike the soap &amp;amp; Glory Arc de Triomphe
which is a matte this one has a little
bit of shimmer in it which is really
beautiful for in the evening and catches
the light for a really flattering brow
look so using the mirror in the palette
I'm just going to lightly color this
underneath the brows and use the brush
to blend it in to my concealer
underneath the brow so thanks to the
shimmer particle as you can see that
this is actually almost acting like a
highlighter and really raising the brow
bone for a beautiful and flattering
effect to finish I need to balance out
my bold brows with a slightly more
intense dramatic eye makeup look so I'm
going back to my Rimmel magnifies
palette which I just absolutely love
it's so versatile I'm going to use a few
of the slightly darker shades to create
a very light smokey eye
firstly I'm going to use this darker
Brown in the crease of my eye to add a
little bit of contour this palette also
has a mirror in the lid so really
practical for application on the go
and then once I applied it to the crease
I'm just focusing it on the corners and
then I'm just blending this in it for a
very soft smokey eye look because I
don't want to apply actual eyeliner but
I do want a little bit more definition
to the lower lash line I'm taking a much
smaller brush the same color and then
I'm going to smudge this into the lower
lashline and upper lash line in place of
liner
so you can see that using the smaller
brush and a darker shade just pressed
into the lashline it gives the effect of
eyeliners so really beautiful to find I
look but without the harshness of using
an eyeliner and also it means you can
get a lot more uses out of an eyeshadow
palette and to finish the look I'm going
to make sure that my lashes are just as
bold as my brows and I'm going to use
the L'Oreal Paris volume million lashes
fatale this is a really good one because
it's a very deep black also curls the
lashes and adds plenty of volume
because I've not gone too overboard on
the eye makeup I can apply a really
beautiful vivid lip color and this also
will help balance out the bold brows so
I've gone for the vivid matte liquid
lipstick from Maybelline New York I've
really obsessed with this color at the
moment it's a really nice transitional
shade from summer to autumn and it's
number 40 very boost so here we have it
my final brow look I've gone for a bold
eyebrow bold lips to match and then a
really beautiful soft smoky eye this is
the kind of look that I would create for
an evening out or if I've got a special
occasion perhaps a wedding I fight
sometimes go for a bold brow and a soft
lip but is something that you can really
experiment with and see what suits you
so hope you guys enjoyed this video
