which is going to be all about my fake
tanning routine I would say that when I
bump into friends or catch up with
people that I haven't seen in a while
one of the first things that they always
always say to me is oh my god Josie how
are you so Brown and I just tell them
the same thing every single time is that
I have a really good self-tanning
routine so as you guys know I actually
love being in the Sun I love going on
holiday and I love tanning but sadly the
end of the summer is coming so I have
got back on my fake tanning routine and
I'd say that for the past two or three
years my actual fake tan routine has not
changed that much a few additional
products have snuck their way into it
but the core routine has not changed so
over the past few years I feel like I've
really perfected it and I thought I
would take some tunity to share a
routine with you guys personally I just
absolutely love to beat and I always
feel so much more confident when I've
got a lovely glow to my skin I find that
my clothes look better I have so much
more confidence and I feel like I look
more toned and just just a whole lot
better when I have a tan and so
personally I love to eat and all year
round but for me a tan always has to
look natural so no streaks no patches
and definitely no smell so it's safe to
say that my standards when it comes to
tanning are pretty high when I see
people with splotches on their wrists or
streaks on their legs I'm like what are
you doing because it is so easy with the
right products to get a perfectly even
streak-free patchy free tan so hopefully
with the tips and tricks that I'm going
to show you in this video any streaks
and patches will be a thing of the past
when it comes to tanning products ice
still use the very first tanning
products that I ever tried obviously not
the same bottle that ran out years ago
but still to this day i use the beatty
Liberata phenomenal 2 to 3-week tan and
anyone that's ever asked me how I'm so
brown you will know this because it is
always the first thing in the rolls of
my tongue so as well as being really
aware of sun damage you guys know that
my skincare routine always contains an
SPF personally I use an SPF 30 and when
I'm on holiday I absolutely always use
sun protection but as well as the damage
that Sun gives to my skin recently I
have become so much more conscious of
the actual chemical products that I've
been putting on my skin so another
reason why I absolutely lovely to
Liberata is because their product of all
free of toxins to the skin
viju barato were actually the first non
toxic tanning brand free of parabens
perfume and alcohol making it so much so
more safe for your skin as well as this
the products contain natural and
certified organic ingredients which
means you can be really confident that
they're actually conditioning the skin
instead of harming it so so many reasons
why I love the brand but the number one
reason of course is because the tan is
amazing so I'm now going to go in to my
tanning routine and how I achieve my
flawless golden tan the first step to
achieving a long-lasting and even tan is
exfoliation which will come as no
surprise to you you've heard it a
million times before but personally just
one exfoliation before you tan is not
enough I like to exfoliate on nearly
daily basis I use exfoliating gloves and
a foaming shower mousse nearly every
single time I shower if not every single
time and there are so so many benefits
so by using exfoliating gloves on a
regular basis your skin is consistently
free of any dry patches and also it
helps you with your shaving as well so
basically when you tan you want to just
remove any obstacles such as unwanted
hair or unwanted areas of dry skin
few use exfoliating gloves and you'll be
able to get a much closer shave also
ensuring that your razor is really sharp
so then no hair is going to get in the
way of your tan routine but also more
importantly gloves like this and just
continually buff away at any areas of
dryness because fake tan that likes to
stick to dry skin so by using gloves
you'll make sure your body is completely
free of dry skin so no more patches when
it comes to shaving these gloves are
also really good at preparing the skin
for shaving to get a really close shave
I actually talked about my shaving
routine in a previous video so if you
want to know more I'll leave that down
below but essentially a close shave is
really important when it comes to
getting even tan as well personally I'd
like to show you the day before tanning
just so that the pores have had time to
close up so you don't get any little
marks on your legs or underarms or
elsewhere when tanning once I step out
of the shower I don't apply any
moisturizer because moisturizer can act
as a barrier you want your skin to be as
clean as possible so nothing on the skin
after I step out the shower instead I
just howl dry and then I'm ready to
apply the fake tan so the product that I
rely on to get my long lasting tan is
the BT Liberata phenomenal 2 to 3-week
tan mousse and as I said this is a
product that I've been using for I'd say
at least 3 years now still to this day
having tried so many tanning brands I'm
yet to find one that I prefer this is so
long-lasting I can honestly say it keeps
me tan for at least two weeks and it
fades really beautifully it looks
incredibly natural I've not got a bad
thing to say about this so when it comes
to my time routine I always start from
the bottom and work my way up but having
said that I don't do my feet first I do
my legs first I'll use a tanning mitt I
always have at least one or two of these
lying around these are a couple of brand
new ones and so I apply a couple of
pumps of the tanning moves directly onto
the mitt and then using circular motions
just apply it all over my legs if you
want to go in a little bit deeper if
you've got a natural tan already then
you can apply a few more pumps and I
find that even if you layer it you're
still not going to go streaky or patchy
so you don't really need to worry just
make sure that all of your skin is
covered
in the tan and thankfully this does have
a guide color so you can really clearly
see where you've tanned and any areas
you might have missed one tip is to
apply your tan standing in front of a
full-length mirror because then you can
really make sure every angle is covered
once you've applied the tan all over my
legs I then use any remaining tan on my
mitt to do my feet
so because the feet naturally can be a
little bit drier and there's all those
angles around your ankles and around
your toes it can look unnatural if you
don't apply it properly so if I have got
enough products left on my mitt I'll
just rub that all over my foot making
sure to go down the sides but if I need
a teeny bit more I'll just do about a
third of a pump and squeeze them it
together so it's really evenly dispersed
and then very lightly put that all over
my feet using the same technique putting
a pump onto the mitt I will then go on
to my tummy my chest and my arms in the
same fashion to be honest when it comes
to using the phenomenal tan there aren't
really any tricks it's just so easy to
apply the guide color is really useful
it definitely helps you to see where
you've done and where you've missed so
that you really can ensure that all of
your body is completely covered and no
matter if you go over an area twice it
always dries so evenly so when my
friends ask me for tips on how to get an
even tan I just say to them use the
phenomenal tan because you just can't be
wrong on my arms I do stop about here so
I don't get any tan too close to my
wrists and the same all the way around
because I do have a special technique
for the hands so what I do when I
finished from my chest downwards is use
whatever is left on the mitt just all
over my hands roll it over to create a
really lovely natural effect on the
hands I find that wrists and between the
fingers is the most obvious place if
you've used fake tan so just by using
the excess on the glove is a really good
way of ensuring you don't get too much
product on my hands another tip if you
are more a gradual tan lover and
personally I like to use gradual tan if
I've got a real tan just to keep it
maintained is to then when you finished
putting gradual tan all over your body
obviously wash your hands I preferred
using my hands when it comes to gradual
tan it's just a lot easier to get it
done really quick
is to wash your hands thoroughly dry
them and then roll your hands inside
your thighs so the backs of your hands
not your palms the backs of your hands
just roll them inside your thighs and
then it will pick up some tan from that
area it's a trick that again I've been
using for many years and it works a
treat so usually when I apply fake tan
I am butt naked or during the bathroom
no one can see so I don't need to worry
about getting any tan lines by this
point I've worked the tan all over my
body for the back sometimes I just leave
it out completely sometimes I will reach
around and other times if I'm being
really fancy I'll put my mitt on a
long-handled body brush and then just
kind of scrub it all over my back but to
be honest if Charlie's around I'll get
him to do it for me on the odd occasion
sometimes if I'm a little bit warm or
perhaps I've gone a little bit overboard
with the amount of tan on my mitt I do
find that I get too much tan on my neck
and also randomly in my cleavage area so
if you find that you've got too much tan
on any part of your body what I like to
do is get a really large buffing brush I
have one from Primark which does the job
perfectly and I just buff the tan in and
this creates a really beautiful airbrush
effect
any way you want on the body I find this
particularly useful for the neck because
I really want to get a smooth edge when
it comes to getting the other face so I
find a buffing brush is perfect for that
kind of area the last area that I tan is
my face and personally I find that real
or fake the tan on my face fades really
really quickly I guess it's because I'm
always applying makeup removing makeup
exfoliating using god-knows-what on my
face so real or fake my tan my face just
does not stick around so for that reason
and also because I shower in tan in the
morning and then go straight on to
applying makeup I don't use the
phenomenal tan on my face although you
can as I said it's got natural
ingredients it's free of perfumes and
parabens so you can use on your face
personally I have
little product which is just incredibly
easy to fit into my daily routine which
is perfect for facial timing the product
in question is this and it's the Vita
Liberata self-tanning and th serum so
there's so many reasons why I love this
but the main thing for me is that it's
so easy to slot into my routine as I
said I don't like to tan in the morning
because I then want to do make a ring
quickly and I find that I don't want to
be adding too many products on top of a
tan just in case it interferes with the
tanning process so once I've removed my
makeup at the end of the day my face is
all cleansed and dried I then apply my
night serum and then I've put a few
drops this into my nighttime moisturizer
what's great about this is that you can
really control how times you get so if
you want to have a really gradual effect
just add one or two drops into a
moisturizer or if you just got back from
a holiday and you want to really boost
your tan to match your body then you can
add three four five drops into your
moisturizer all apply it direct to the
face another amazing thing about this is
that if you do decide to use this
instead of the night cream then you're
not going to miss out on any of the
skincare benefits the talent serum is
not only anti-aging but it also contains
collagen boosting ingredients so it's
really really good for your skin
especially over night to make sure your
skin is getting all the nourishment that
it needs the serum also contains the hy
h2o hydration complex which is something
that Vita Liberata have created to
balance out the oils on your face and
also prevent your pores from clogging
and for me this is so so so important
because before I discovered this and
this is a really new launch I think it's
only been out for a few weeks but before
I discovered this I really hated tanning
on my face because I actually have quite
big and open pores and I always used to
find that tan would just sit there
leaving me looking like I have massive
blackheads which is not the good look
but now I just apply a few drops of this
personally I use about 3 drops maybe
twice or three times a week add it to my
night moisturizer and it has changed the
way I tan it's great that you can just
pick it up and add it into a night cream
when you need it you can go a few days
without it and let it fade
naturally or you can just keep on using
it to maintain a really beautiful
flawless and incredibly natural time so
that's my face and body tanning routine
and once I've achieved that perfect tan
I want to ensure that I maintain it
properly so what I like to do is
basically exfoliate every time I get in
the shower using the exact same
technique as my pre ten exfoliation I
just lightly exfoliate maybe three or
four times a week basically whenever I'm
in the shower
and that basically ensures that my tan
when it does fade fades evenly and there
are no patches if however as is the case
of a moment during summer when I want to
be constantly tanned
this ensures that my skin is always
ready for the next layer of tan what I
love about the beauty liberal-arts a
phenomenal tan is that you can just keep
on applying more layers personally I'd
say I apply a new layer every week just
to ensure that I'm always that beautiful
dark color that I love to be I really
wanted to show before and after on this
video but actually because I have been
using it so consistently I'm not really
as pale as I could be so that would be
nearly impossible but this tan that I've
got at the moment is I'd say a week
after my initial phenomenal tan
application the last thing I wanted to
tell you about is how I give a body part
or body parts an instant boost if
perhaps I have a last minute event or my
tan has faded slightly and I really want
to just have perfect legs maybe I've got
a photo shoot basically I use the Vita
Liberata body blur for those occasions
when I just want my skin to look
absolutely perfect so the Vita Liberata
body blur instant HD skin finish is
basically makeup for your body I apply
this with my hands and then make sure
that I wash my hands afterwards that is
the most important thing because well
you'll be able to see that your hands
are brown when you've applied this but
it really is like makeup for your legs
it just disguises any blemishes any
bruises in my case I have a few veins on
my legs so when I applied
this it's just an average effect
blurring of the skin all over my legs
you can also use it on your chest and
your arms but personally for me it's
just fantastic for using on the legs
once again it contains natural and
organic extracts it also contains aloe
vera and sheer butter so you can also
replace your body moisturizer for this
if before you go out you like to
moisturize your legs then you can use
this instead and still be confident your
skin is going to be beautifully hydrated
and conditioned for the time that you're
wearing it because the ingredients
within this calf your skin you can of
course also use it on your face you can
use it as a base for your makeup or you
can even mix it in with your foundation
if you just want your skin to be even
more perfected and that little bit more
tanned which is great for a last-minute
thing again if you haven't been using
the drops at night and you just want to
have an instant bit of town on the face
then this is absolutely perfect so my
application is simply put a dog in my
hands and then rub it in all over my
legs I just do it really really quickly
because I find that it does almost set a
little bit so I try and get my legs done
as soon as possible again standing in
front of a full-length mirror so I can
have a look around every angle and make
sure I haven't missed anywhere then of
course thoroughly washing your hands
afterwards just to make sure there are
no telltale signs so that is my tanning
routine you guys now know all of my
secrets when it comes to how I keep my
very natural looking tan all year round
how I give my holiday tan a bit of a
boost and basically stay this color no
matter what the British weather I hope
you found it useful and I hope you found
it interesting also discovering about
the products free to the Murata as I
said is a brand that I have used for so
many years
the phenomenal tan in particular is just
a cold product in my tanning routine I
recommend it to everybody because I just
can't fault it it goes on beautifully
the tan is gorgeous so natural it
doesn't smell it fades evenly there is
honestly not one single negative thing
about the phenomenal tan equally I'm
just so pleased to now have the
anti-aging serum and the body blur in my
tanning routine I feel like finally I
have a 360 tan routine that I just
absolutely love and hand on heart would
