youtube channel thanks so much for
joining me for today's video today I
wanted to share with you a few thoughts
benefits and uses of coconut oil and I
know it's nothing new it's no revelation
that coconut oil is a really fantastic
thing to use invasive diet your skin
care and your hair care routine but it's
something which for me is still fairly
new and you guys know that I'm pretty
slower going on bandwagons so this will
probably come as no surprise to you but
it has really been in the past couple of
months I'd say
and a lot thanks to Charlie really that
I have incorporated coconut oil a lot
more in many aspects of my life as I
mentioned within food it's obviously a
really healthy alternative to cooking
oils within my hair care routine and my
skin care routine so I thought I would
share with you a few of these benefits
and uses in today's video so coconut oil
has a multitude of health benefits
firstly as a healthier alternative to a
lot of the oil so we previously used to
use when cooking so personally I like to
use it instead of olive oil when I'm
making things like healthy pancakes
which I made recently I just like to
heat up some coconut oil in the pan
instead of using normal cooking oils and
I find this is a lot better for
digestion and also research has proved
that the coconut oil is much better for
your immunity so especially as we come
into these cooler months and
occasionally we start to pick up bugs
and flus it's a really good idea to keep
your immunity as high as possible and
coconut oil is a really great healthy
way of doing that as well as the
ingestion benefits there are also so
many skincare benefits to using coconut
oil
it's an incredibly effective moisturizer
on all skin types and it's a safe
solution for helping dry skin if you get
any flaking patches of skin and it
offers long-lasting hydration as well
it's also well known for its antioxidant
properties which means coconut oil is
really good at fighting those early
signs of skin aging as well as helping
some skin conditions such as eczema
psoriasis dermatitis
other skin conditions though it comes as
no surprise that coconut oil is now the
main ingredient in so many body products
most recently and the personal favorite
of mine is the new Palmers coconut oil
formula range and this includes the body
lotion and a body oil of course coconut
oil can be applied directly to the skin
but if like me you prefer something a
little bit more pampering then this is
definitely something that's worth a try
the coconut oil from Parma's contains no
parabens no mineral oil no glutens
sulfates or dyes the lotion contains raw
organic coconut oil and Tahitian monoi I
find the coconut scent just so relaxing
and spa-like that it really is a lovely
switch to make plus you get all of those
benefits that I previously mentioned
from coconut oil and of course from
Palmer's you get this long-lasting
24-hour hydration which I absolutely
love especially in these months where
it's starting to get cooler
unfortunately summer I think it's sad to
say has gone so our skin does need a
little bit of extra love personally I
find that my shins sometimes get quite
dry whereas with this because I can rely
on that 24-hour moisture it really does
just leave my skin smooth flake free for
actually say over 24 hours I applied
this most mornings after my shower and I
find that I don't need to apply it the
next day
but I do just because I want to keep my
skin nourished and glowing throughout
the cooler months if you prefer an oil
consistency they also have a coconut
body oil I find that this is just a
really luxurious way of moisturizing the
skin it does sit on the skin for a
little while so you can really enjoy
that luxurious feeling of the oil and
the fragrance and of course it's also
free of parabens mineral oil sulfates
and all of those bad things what makes
these products better than just using
coconut oil alone is that they also
contain additional ingredients which are
wonderful for the skin including
Tahitian monoi and tre flower petals
which is incredibly luxurious and
pampering for the skin so as you can
imagine the fragrance is just absolutely
heavenly
unlike using actual coconut oil I do
prefer the center these products is just
a little bit lighter and it sinks in
much more quickly even the oil the body
lotion sinks in almost straightaway but
the oil it lasts on the skin for maybe
20 seconds and then it's just slowly
absorbed by the skin which drinks in all
of that moisture and goodness and it
really has become a highlight of my
morning routine as well as this it
contains sweet almond oil which is known
for really nourishing and calming the
skin so if you get any areas of redness
recently I went a little bit
aboard with a body scrub and my whole
body was itchy is really unusual I don't
usually suffer from sensitive skin but
the almond oil and earnest to really
help to soothe it out and before I knew
it I was no longer it sheet so for that
I was very very grateful
the smell itself is also really
comforting so if you're having one of
those morning's where just everything's
going wrong I find it really lovely to
take a few moments out pamper myself
cover myself in a lovely lotion or oil
and inhale that very pampering fragrance
and before you know it I'm feeling much
much better about myself so so many
benefits to using these products alone
as well as this coconut oil is really
beneficial for using in your hair
whether you have dry hair or oily hair
coconut oil can really help to balance
out the hair and also repair damage so
personally what I like to do sometimes
is take a big scoop of coconut oil when
I know that I'm going to wash my hair
the next day I'll massage it into the
very tops of my head and this also if
used over a long term it can help to
fight against dandruff and long-lasting
dryness as well when I wash it out the
next morning I usually double shampoo
just to make sure all the oil is out of
my hair and the result is just really
easy to comb through shiny hair and who
doesn't want that so a really good
benefit for using it on your hair I
don't know the science behind it but
coconut oil also helps to reduce the
protein loss in hair and when your hair
doesn't have enough protein it can be
really prone to breakage and generally
looks a lot more dull and unhealthy so
there's also the benefit of adding
additional protein into your hair or
stopping your hair from losing the
protein as you age or if you over style
over color or anything that your hair
isn't loving other Beauty uses for
coconut oil include using it some makeup
remover I actually first discovered this
when I was in Thailand way back when I
was about 18 and I'd run out of face
wipes but I did have some coconut oil so
I just gently massaged it over my face
kind of hoping it would work and it
worked absolute wonders at melting away
all my makeup just like I don't know the
super expensive cleansing balm and then
at the end I just very very gently
applied it over my eye makeup and I was
wearing waterproof makeup that day cos
I've been on the beach and it just
worked wonders a really gently
being the makeup from my skin you can
also use coconut oil as a moisturizer
this really depends on personal
preference and skin type personally I
find it a little bit heavy but I know
that my friends that do have dry skin
say that their skin loves it and just
completely drinks it in it's also really
good as an under-eye cream because it's
a lot more lightweight than a lot of the
eye crews you can get on the market so
if you suffer from sensitive skin under
the eyes and you don't want to block up
the pores then just using a very small
amount
I'd say grain of rice size amount of
coconut oil under the eyes is a really
lovely way to pamper that area
other uses include using it as a cuticle
balm as a lip balm and also in the past
I've been known to add some scoops of
sea salt into the coconut oil to create
a lovely natural body scrub there really
are so many uses this video could go on
for absolutely hours because coconut oil
is known for its healing powers you can
also use it as an aftershave balm if you
get any bumps or razor burn then just
apply a small amount wound in the hands
to any areas of discomfort and on that
same note it can also be used as an
after Sun as it really helps to soothe
and then help the skin to recover from
any damage so those are my favorite uses
of coconut oil and also some of the
benefits hopefully you guys have found
this interesting and useful and do let
me know if you have any other uses of
coconut oil that you like to try at home
as well the new Palmers coconut oil
range is out now you can buy it in Boots

want to get some coconut oil goodness
into your daily routine then definitely
