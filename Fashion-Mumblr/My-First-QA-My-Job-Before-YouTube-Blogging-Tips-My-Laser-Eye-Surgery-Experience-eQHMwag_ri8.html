joining me for today's video which is
going to be my first-ever Q&amp;amp;A video so I
asked you guys if you have your
questions for me over on Instagram
snapchat and YouTube and you have lots
of questions so that's what today's
video is going to be I thought I would
do this because well I've never done one
before and sometimes when I read through
my comments I noticed the same questions
popping up over and over again and you
guys know I reply to most of my comments
especially the day a video goes live but
it can get hard to answer them all and
especially when I'm doing the same
answers over and over again so I thought
I would take some of those frequently
asked questions Dexter what are you
chewing one hunt is true makeup boxers
that's fine um so yeah I thought I would
just ask you um to ask me things and on
some this video so I'm rambling the
coffee is starting time and effect so
I'm just going to get straight stuck in
there okie dokie where shall I start oh
and by the way I always get asked about
my phone case this one is literally just
from Claire's accessories they have
really good and really cheap phone cases
so that's why this one is from okay so
I'm going to start with Instagram I
uploaded this photo of my shoes my
amazing River Island Gucci esque shoes
no relation whatsoever I guess I was
struggling for a caption so I asked you
to ask me some questions and you did so
let's have a look Laura Dyer said where
is the next place you would like to
travel and how long do you see yourself
doing YouTube okay thanks Brooke let's
just turn it on silent so um where has
the next place you would like to travel
um to be honest the top of my list at
the moment are slightly more unusual
exotic places so places like the
Galapagos Islands Bora Bora
French Polynesia those kind of areas
they are definitely top of my wishlist
and I just think they're so unusual you
don't really see people going there
they're not like megali touristy at all
and I love this kind of holiday
I love when you land and you look how
the plane window and you just have no
clue what you're going to experience
that's a bit off-topic but yeah I just
love that feeling I love going into the
unknown so I think slightly more unusual
places like that and then the second
part of Laura's question is how long can
you see yourself doing YouTube that's a
really tough question because even two
years ago or less than that 18 months
ago I couldn't even see myself doing
YouTube at all this is still fairly new
to me and but I love it so much I don't
really see it ending anytime soon and I
think as long as YouTube remains popular
I will probably keep doing it I guess
when things evolve when I become a mum
then maybe I'll make it into a mummy
channel and maybe like interiors Channel
or baking channel just wherever my
interest take me I think I'll probably
adapt and hopefully you guys can grow
with me marry Louisiana I think that's
right name she said ID or those shoes
thank you also I'd like to ask about
your style icons and who do you take
inspiration from for your outfits when
you're shopping so I don't really have
any celebrity style icons I mean there
are celebrities where I look at them and
I think they look fabulous but I don't
really have any icons I would say that I
get most my inspiration from Instagram
honestly when I see someone style I love
I screenshot it
I definitely follow accounts with people
whose style that I find is similar to
mine or star that I aspire to
I find that they like to know it
Instagram account is a really good one
I'll leave that link down below and they
basically are shoppable Instagram
account and show you guys know about
like to know it but you can sign up to
their platform double tap the photo and
then you get to shop from the image just
amazing I love doing that and I'm always
um basically stealing the style from the
girls that are featured on that channel
Jana Finlayson I hope that's right said
what are your essential beauty hacks you
can't do without oh um I have actually
done a beauty hacks video before
although it's very old so maybe I should
recreate it but I would say um ones that
I can't live without
hmmm I think probably like what I
mentioned in my recent tanning routine
video like my tanning hacks are ones I
couldn't live without because I love to
have a flawless tan so my tanning hacks
are ones that I use really really
regularly and also like using the
exfoliating gloves it's not do it out I
just think they are essential for
keeping your skin smooth and for keeping
the tan lasting a long time so yeah I
stratum clothes not really hack but I
don't really do quirky hacks very often
some things like putting my clothes in
the shower not in the actual wet shower
in the shower room if they're a little
bit too crinkled because then the
creases drop out that's one that I use
really regularly as well
Jana also said I hope that is how you
pronounce her name there was a Welsh
girl in my school whose name was Jana
and it was pronounced and spelled like
that so it could be Iona but I'm hoping
it's Donna she also asked what's your
favorite designer shop what I don't
really shop designer that much because I
can't afford it and but I do like to
treat myself to Valentino's so
Valentino's shoes were my first ever
designer purchase I bought myself a pair
of rock studs as my graduation gift to
myself and then you guys may have seen
that I recently picked up a rock stat
handbag in the beautiful coral color so
I say designer wise auntie no and but I
do also love on the higher end of the
high street
I love Club Monica again I wish I could
afford to pay more that than I currently
can do but that's my favorite premium
high street store Alexandra quirk asked
how do you come up with ideas for
getting what you want to say and your
style across on the internet Oh
mmm I don't know I mean I spend a lot of
time watching other youtubers so I guess
if I see someone doing something that I
like the look of but I think oh I could
do that slightly differently or in my
own certain way then that I guess and
also a lot of it is what you guys ask so
I as I said I always read the comments
and for example a lot of you have
recently been asking for a work where
some work where style ideas so I'm going
to do that a lot of you have asked for a
makeup collection and a shoe collection
and I'm planning on filming that this
week it's a lot of my ideas I haven't
you come from you so thank you for
singings because it really really does
help me a lot any tips for someone who
has just moved to London free things to
do good places to eat etc and that's
from Isabel grace but actually I've got
a press release from the Lonely Planet
the other day and they are bringing out
a book for you things to do in London so
that my new good one for you and but I
would say just walk around like get get
and don't get one of those tourist buses
get an all-day bus pass just sailing
busses and explore because it's amazing
firstly how close everything is to each
other in London you think that when
you're on the tube they feel miles away
you feel like you're going miles but
you're not so maybe is hop on like the
one three seven verse it goes all around
Oxford Circus Knightsbridge legs Square
sixth floor when you move to London
explore and also if you're paying rent
then just remember that everything costs
a lot more than you think it will so I
think you should only spend around a
third of your salary on your rent
because then you have to remember you've
got bills on top eating is so much more
expensive than anywhere else food is so
much more expensive so yeah definitely
prepare yourself financially if you're
moving to London Isabel o single Isabel
also asked what you must have for a
corporate wardrobe as I said planning a
workfare video very soon so keep a
lookout for that one a demeanor
joette asked any organization tips for
back-to-school hmm um well I would say
go and treat yourself to some nice
stationery because I think when you have
like a new diary new pencil case you
feel so much more pride in your work and
you really enjoy making your work
beautiful you love using a new
stationery so for me that was a real
good motivator and got me really excited
to go back to school and remain super
duper organized I'd also say to write
things down because when you're in
school you need workplace you have a lot
of things going on in your head you've
got like stuff with your friends you've
got like free time plans also homework
and deadlines so I think by writing
things down it takes a load off your
mind and helps you stay organized so
they've been my tips but another video
plug I'm also going to be doing a video
all about tips for starting uni so maybe
if you watch that even though it's uni
not school they will still pretty be
some things in that
do coming soon which should be relevant
to you if Vanna Parrish cross said can
you show photos before having blonde
hair did it damage your hair when you
changed her cover Levana I will try if I
can find any photos they're going to be
very old and embarrassing I will insert
them here and I really don't know if I
have any because to be honest like ever
since Facebook has been around I've had
blonde hair I mean I've gone blonder
over time but for as long as I can
remember I think I started dyeing my
hair when I was about 14 I used all
kinds of at home dyeing kits and then
moved on to get me done at the
hairdresser's so yeah but do you also
ask about damage yes it does damage your
hair because when you get your hair dyed
blond obviously it strips away a lot of
the hair leaving her hairs thinner but I
use a lot of conditioning masks when I
was 18 19 my hair was in the worst
condition of its life and I had to use
TG urban anecdote conditioner that was
the only one that I could brush through
my hair with but now because I use such
nice hair masks and I use hair masks
twice a week my hair doesn't feel
damaged anymore in fact I think it's in
really good condition considering how
much car is in it next Olivia eight two
one nine said can you talk about laser
eye surgery that's really interesting I
think I mentioned it as a passing
comment in a recent video that I have
had laser eye surgery and I had it done
two years ago maybe three years ago and
I had it done at Moorfields Eye Hospital
I used to wear contact lenses every
single day I found them annoying I just
hated that part of my morning routine
they would dry my eyes out and I
actually the final straw was that I
broke no I lost a pair of Chanel glasses
so I used to love my Chanel like geek
chic glasses but I lost them I left them
on a train and that was the final straw
I don't want to wear my other old glass
so I did a lot of research into
different places and I decided to go to
Moorfields Eye Hospital because it's an
eye hospital like I really trusted them
and it was
round oh I think it's like there was a
lot of money I think there's about two
thousand pounds but I paid it off in
installments and basically I had to have
the gross version of laser eye surgery
where they take away your whole cornea
because I think that's right and because
the flap that covers your eye normally
they just peel it away do the surgery
and then put it back again but because
my flap thing was too thin they had to
take the whole thing away and do the
surgery and let it grow back naturally
which meant that um I basically couldn't
see three days it was like looking
through fogged up glasses it really
hurts for the recovery period the
surgery itself didn't hurt at all it's
just a little bit weird and it felt like
a bit of pressure on your eye but the
surgery itself didn't hurt I walks away
from it like is that it
but then the recovery process because of
my particular type of surgery which is
either lassic what I said can't remember
I'll write it here and yeah because I
obviously had growing pains in my eye
and I had to use numbing eyedrops every
15 minutes even in the nighttime I was
sleep for 10 minutes wake up to the pain
and have to put the drops in but at the
end of the day it was worth it because
I'm so pleased to know how to wear
contact lenses or glasses and I would go
through it again but I would hope that
next time I can have the other type of
surgery because my friends that have had
that done so it's just so easy and you
don't suffer the way that I suffered how
tall you said so so Sarah I'm sorry
Sarah I actually don't know how tall I
am I'm really I'm not right at all and
not the shortest of people I'm going to
measure myself after this video and
write it here freckles and Vogue said
what advice would you give to someone
starting their blog I could go on for
hours about this um because I feel like
I have lots of things to say you know me
I'm very opinionated but I think I did
actually do a blog post on this recently
so I'm going to leave that links down
below and also if you would like a whole
video on starting a blog or You Tube
channel let me know because I've got a
lot of words to say but my Worman advice
would be just start and just write write
a lot write about whatever you're
passionate about but don't hang around
just just do it
Emily and Fox so since I know you were a
uni student wants to do you have any
advice on how to budget for those beauty
and fashion treats yes I would say that
make sure all your purchases are very
well-informed to do a lot of research
read a lot of blogs and watch a lot of
YouTube videos to make sure you know
that what you are buying is right for
you I'd say don't get pressured into
buying things from pushy sales
assistants just go in there like be
confident and go in for what you want
definitely always make the most of
testers if it's foundation make sure you
go outside and look at the color in
natural daylight and always ask for a
little sample pot because foundations
especially you need to wear it with your
skincare routine so by getting a tester
and most shops including boots will give
you testers if they're being stingy and
they're like oh we've run out of pots go
to Muji and buy the pots and then be
like here we go that's what I used to do
in uni because I couldn't afford it this
sounds so bad but I couldn't afford
expensive foundation but I wanted the
latest Chanel Dior so I just used to go
and get tested Pottsville nice to live
from tester BOTS so tragic but save me a
lot of money just sweet just more said
Josie with all the filming blogging
editing social media posts events
meetings etc how do you prioritize and
manage your time efficiently and avoid
burnout that's a really really good
question um I think for me it's that I
love what I do so I am obviously I'm
working right now but I I love it like I
really enjoy filming I love meetings I
think I'm incredibly lucky with my job
that everything is spot-on even meetings
I don't tread meetings it's like having
a catch-up with a friend because people
that I meet are usually from brands or
Beauty pr's
they're girls my own age at the same
interest so we end up just gossiping for
half the time which is just so much fun
so I think because I love it that's how
I avoid burnout and but prioritizing is
oh that's quite hard and I think you
just have to be strong with yourself you
know deep down what tasks you need to
get done and what your deadlines are so
I think you just have to be really
strong yourself and don't procrastinate
procrastination is the biggest killer I
do it sometimes like you'll see me
rambling on snapchat and that is me
procrastinating but don't get sucked
into like spending hours watching silly
cats on YouTube or something
I think whatever you do is your time
make sure you're being productive
well that's informing yourself by
watching a an informative youtube video
or something like that but yeah
procrastination is really bad some
people watching us may even be
procrastinating by watching this why
don't you just listen put your earphones
in you could be doing something useful
like you could have painting your nails
at the same time I am a serial
multitasker so I could not just sit and
watch a YouTube video I'd have to be
either painting my nails or like writing
a to-do list or I don't know just
multitasking for me also is a really
good way of getting a lot of stuff done
a nkh 35b
I don't know how to pronounce Hillary
I'm sorry and said how long have you
lived at your current home and you and
Charlie have plans to move somewhere
larger with Dexter so we have lived in
this house since November 2012 it was a
few days after my 21st birthday and I
really really love this house we live in
noir just outside not we live in London
it's like zone 2 so yeah it's a really
good location great for my work at the
moment I think I obviously would love to
move somewhere bigger we are really
lucky with this house 3-bedroom we've
got a little little garden for Dexter
I'm going to do a house tour soon maybe
50,000 subscribers I'll do a house tour
I know I keep promising it but they're
actually quite time-consuming so yeah
you'll see my house soon but yeah it's
great for how we are at the moment but I
think in maybe four or five years when
perhaps Charlie has his own business and
can work from home - we'll move out to
the countryside and have a really nice
big house and a big garden to film Lots
in have some more photogenic bedrooms
for filming and lots of room for Dexter
to run around and then the second half a
question what was it and did you two do
where do you and Charlie see yourselves
in five years and that is really hard
hopefully in the countryside somewhere
with a bigger house maybe no to be
no really hard to say work-wise
everything changes so quickly in this
industry I really could not tell you the
only thing I do know is I'm just going
to hopefully continue with YouTube and I
think I'll probably be working from home
a lot more so hopefully better quality
videos more life Sally I don't know
so mm Sheldon hi em said if you could
only have three items on a desert island
what would you take okay
Sun cream because obviously SPF and yes
I'm going would be my first one a
swimsuit would be my second one actually
I don't know depend if I was going
because no I won't take a swimsuit
I'll just be naked I don't really care
about that beauty wise I would take a BB
cream because I don't know I feel no I
wouldn't wanna do something wrong I
think I know does Island I would
probably get a good time of my face I
wouldn't need BB cream okay I would take
mascara because then I would feel human
at least and Oh Dexter I'd take it
Dexter because I wouldn't want to be
without him Amy Mowbray said what is
your favorite item in your wardrobe
currently oh I would have to say my pink
pleated top shop trousers I mentioned
these in my favorites which I actually
filmed earlier today you might recognize
this make up an outfit and yeah I filmed
it like an hour ago but yeah I talked
about them in my favorites I left them
at Soho farmhouse because I needed to
get them washed and but they are my
favorites at the moment and I have worn
them so much since I got them about
three weeks ago you saw me trying them
on in my Oxford Street haul video which
I'll leave down below and yeah just
absolutely love them so I'll leave a
photo here of me wearing them and a link
to them down below because they are the
bomb diggity and yeah that is everything
on Instagram so now I'm going to move to
YouTube because I also just mentioned it
in one of my YouTube comments so let's
see what you guys are asking on the tube
house
okie-dokie kavita man said I'd like to
know a little more about you in terms of
more general questions and I'd also like
to know about your work before YouTube
and now as a youtuber so my work before
YouTube I studied at London College of
Fashion
I then worked at mulberry in their
marketing team and then I worked for a
software company who had a software that
I sold to retailers to put in retailers
apps and we worked with the likes of net
reporter John Lewis Macy's the londo and
I was their marketing manager so that
was really good fun I love my job
but I was blogging as a hobby alongside
it and then I just I ran and I wrote a
blog post about this about why I made
the jump from working to blogging
full-time so if you want to read in
detail about why I started blogging
full-time I'll leave that blog post down
below and but yeah I think I did have I
think having had a professional non
youtube career beforehand really did
help me helped me learn about the
workplace learning about being
professional and working with others so
I am really glad that I had that
experience before jumping into YouTube
if you guys want a video about my work
experience working in the fashion
industry then let me know it is
something that I've been thinking about
filming for a long time so if you want
to know about life before YouTube and my
thoughts about working in the fashion
industry then let me know righty-ho um
simply Sophie said how did you come up
with your username guys I really don't
know if I like my username fashion
mumbler like sometimes I like it
sometimes I don't I really struggled and
I thought about a few things I
personally I don't really think that my
surname is very appropriate for YouTube
my surname is fear f.e.a.r
and I just didn't think it was like
didn't sound like a very youtubers
certain otherwise I would have just done
my name but fashion mumbler so I do
mumble so that's kind of where the
mumbler bit came from and yeah there's
not really a cool story
so it's disappoint Kara Damon Damon said
what course are you studying and what
job do you plan to pursue after your
studies so I'm actually not studying
anymore I graduated in 2000
and 14 I think and I studied fashion
management at London quality fashion and
my job is you to blogging so I'm gonna
carry on doing it next question is from
Petra green and Petra asked what's it
like when you worked at Mulberry slash
the fashion industry in general in
brackets are still kind of consider
working in a fashion history right now
but what was it like me had a boss was
it stressful for an exciting I mean it
was stressful at times I'm the kind of
person that I'm really highly motivated
so I'm quite happy working for myself
and what I did find hard was the lack of
flexibility so working in an office
obviously you have your office hours
even though we did have flexi time so I
could do like 8 a.m. till 5 p.m. or 9:00
a.m. till 6 p.m. or whatever so that was
good but I found having like holiday
days really stressful I I didn't enjoy
having to hand in a form be like please
can I go on holiday on these dates I
hated that I can't lie I hated it so
yeah I was stressful in those respects
but I but the two jobs that I did before
doing this full-time I did love my job
and I think loving a job is really key
to keeping it exciting and in both jobs
I was really lucky that I had quite a
lot responsibilities so that also kept
it exciting and fun because I could kind
of make the job into what I wanted it to
be if that makes sense
Lucy agar a major said what is your
favorite makeup brand that's a really
tricky question actually and I don't
really have one particular brand
I'd say high-end I love Tom Ford
I love Charlotte Tilbury I love tarts
two-phase low end or high street I love
Rimmel lip bourgeois I don't have a
favorite brand
I just have loved so many Sarah Robinson
asked who's your favorite youtuber so I
probably have like four or five
favorites I love watching Victoria from
in the fro
I think her videos are just so beautiful
her videos are goals for me the way
they're filmed and edited and the
content that she comes up with our
fabulous I love watching her me
Liliana's videos I think again her
content is amazing and I really enjoy
editing and her vlogs are refun I also
love Fleur de force she's a lovely girl
in herself and also in her videos I
think she's so down-to-earth and I think
we have very similar tastes so yeah I
really like watching fleurs videos who
else I have so many favorites I go to a
whole video website they're probably the
top three that when I see a new one that
has been published by them then I watch
it straight away
Olivia young can you explain your laser
eye surgery experience already did it
Sarah and fourteen said has having a
youtube channel and blog affected your
personal life yes so much because
blogging and YouTube takes over
everything because for example if you go
on holiday and you're in a beautiful
place before blog in YouTube
I would just relax and enjoy it but when
you are in these beautiful places when
you have a blog or use your channel you
want to create content there you want to
capture and you want to share it so that
means that everything is a work
opportunity or a blog opportunity which
changes it changes everything if I go
out for a beautiful meal I want to
photograph I want to vlog it I want to
snapchat it so nothing nothing can be
done without it being somehow
work-related which does have its
benefits like I love sharing these
things with you guys but also it can get
a little bit too much personal life wise
and because I loved work I also stopped
all to switch off and that does cause a
few punishments as you can imagine sue
sue Al Gore's I'm so sorry said that
wrong and asked how old are you I
actually have to think about this
sometimes and often I'll say a number
and someone will correct you like no
joke that's not how old you are but I am
as far as I'm aware I'm 24 Claire said
how did you and Charlie meet well um
this is a lovely story and we talked all
about it in the boyfriend tag video so
I'll leave that linked down below for
you to go and have a little watch Lauren
bellezza said what's your exercise
routine and I go to the gym and I do hit
training most the time so on a treadmill
I do a lot of ab exercises so like
crunching on the Roman chair again I'm
planning a video on this so stay tuned
Oh interesting
Sarah Nichols said thoughts on all past
experiences on
how to get over a relationship hmm I'm
not very good giving relationship advice
because to be honest I've had three
serious boyfriends in my life and
they've all been very close together so
I've never we had much down time to like
think about being heartbroken or sad to
be honest in my experience the best way
to get a relationship is to get another
one I know that's a really bad thing to
say um but I think if you just put all
of your passion into something or
someone else then you're not going to
have time to think about what you've
just lost or the relationship you just
had I know that's really like um I don't
know what the word is politically
correct it's not I know it's not the
best advice but that's what has been my
personal experience Caitlin Cox asked do
you have or would you ever get a tattoo
and other than my eyebrows which are
kind of tattooed I don't have any and I
don't really want to get any it's just
not my style I think they look great on
other people but they're not really my
thing I'm kind of scared about putting
something that permanent on my body so
amethyst 28 said what is your go-to shop
oh and the story of Dexter would be
great too so my favorite shop I would
say I love a sauce i buy a lot terming
sauce as you guys know from my all whole
videos in fact just today before filming
this video I made my biggest a sauce
order ever like we're talking massive
order so going to be doing another haul
very very soon so a sauce is pretty much
my go-to because it has so many my
favorite brands it has like warehouse
misguided Ryland and just a certain
brand I really like and but it will soda
Topshop River Island if I could afford
it I would buy more from Club Monaco
I love Selfridges yeah I have a lot of
favorite songs and you also asked the
story of deaf stuff really speaking of
which he's just pouring on the doors I'm
gonna go and get yeah he is the little
sausage um I'm not sure what you mean by
the story of Dexter maybe like how we
got him and but basically Charlie and I
had wanted a dog for a long time were
both dog people and when I started
vlogging full-time it was
more it was more appropriate that we can
get a dog because I've been working from
home a lot more so we decided pretty
much this time last year just over a
year ago it was the right time to get a
dog and we did lots of research into
breeds and we just fell in love with
sausage dogs we looked on those are
different websites on where to get in
from but the thing with websites is
there are so many different prices so
many different families
you just don't know who to trust and a
lot of the time they were really far
away so we would have had job driven say
for hours to maybe not you to ever turn
up to a house and be like I don't want a
dog but you know it's a long way to
drive for it not to be the perfect
situation so we put it on hold for a
little bit and then I was actually at a
blog event so Fleur de force was
launching her eyelashes and her dog
piglet was there and piglet is a sausage
dog so I actually asked her where she
got picked up from and she gave me the
number of a lady and she said oh you
should talk to her quickly because I
know she's just had a litter of puppies
so that very evening I text the lady who
forgot piglet from and she said we have
one black in town little boy lap and
sent a photo and I'll insert that photo
here and she was like it's the little
one on the right and I fell in love and
two days later we went to go and pick
him up so that's how we got Dexter if
you want to see the vlog of us actually
picking up I did film one so that's
another video that I'm gonna leave down
below without going to so many links
down below is crazy so guys I do
actually have lots more questions and
also questions on snapchat but I feel
like this video is gonna be SuperDuper
long so I'm going to stop talking maybe
I will film another Q&amp;amp;A in the near
future and maybe a themed one around
work or something so I'll keep you guys
updated but for now I'm going to stop
talking because even Dexter's going
forward he's starting to choose stuff so
yeah thank you so much for watching
sorry but ink around to answering your
question but as I said I will do another
one in maybe a few weeks time so thank
you guys so much for watching and give
this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it
or if you'd like to see more cuties from
me and i will see you very very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
