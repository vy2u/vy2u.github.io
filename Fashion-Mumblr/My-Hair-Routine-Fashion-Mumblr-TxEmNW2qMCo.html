joining me for today's video today I'm
going to be talking all about my hair
whether that's my hair itself the
products that I use the appliances that
I use basically a whole video devoted to
my hair this is by far my most requested
video you guys are always asking me
about the products that I use and the
way that I style my hair so I thought I
would just devote an entire video to my
hair care routine I've got a whole load
of products laid out on the bed next to
me so without further ado let's get
started so my hair itself is long as you
can see it's kind of like just around
boob length um couldn't think of a
better way of describing the length the
hair itself is quite fine um but I have
quite a lot of it so my hair um a lot of
people might think that it's thick it's
actually not that thick it's um thin I
just have a lot of the individual hairs
and my hair is of course it's colored as
you can see my roots are a little bit
darker than the blonde that I get
colored I color my hair about once every
6 to 7 to 8 weeks and my hair is colored
by the Johannesburg salon on South
Audley Street so that's in central
London it's about a five minute walk
from Oxford Street and and yeah that's
where I like to get my hair colored they
do a really cool technique where they
basically paint my scalp and because I
don't want to get the roots that I don't
want my hair to have very obvious roots
so they basically paint the scalp in a
color that's a few shades lighter than
my natural hair color then they wash
that out and then they put in some
lighter blonde highlights because I
really like to have some lighter shades
I almost I asked for kind of like a
white bright ashy blonde shade to go
through the hair because I really don't
like my hair to be one flat color so
that's what they do at the salon um I
just really really like it there they
serve breakfast lunch and probably
dinner as well which is great too when
your hair is as long as mine I am
usually in the salon for about five
hours when I get my hair
so it's really nice they have really
yummy breakfast and smoothies and copies
and the last time I was there I had a
beetroot and goats cheese salad my lunch
as well which was lovely
condition-wise considering that my hair
is very frequently colored I'm often
told that my hair is in really good
condition and that's quite rare when you
bleach your hair as regularly as I do I
think it's down to the products that I
use I've always really loved using
lovely haircare products and I'd say
that it's one thing that I do like to
splash out on so quite a few kind of
luxury hair products in here but also
some cheaper alternatives as well so
when I wash my hair there's not one
particular shampoo or conditioner and
that I'm absolutely obsessed with
instead I love to try new things as I
said and I've got a few favorites at the
moment which I'll talk you through now
so the first shampoo and conditioner
range I'm absolutely obsessed with at
the moment is the perfect for platinum
range from pure ology now I first
discovered this when I got my hair cut
at the Georgia Northwood salmon which is
silent salon which is above Oxford
Street if you're looking at the map and
they basically got me hooked on this
range here the products itself or the
shampoo at least is this kind of blue
color not sure if you can see that which
really helps to slightly lift blond hair
not as much as a violent shampoo I'll
move on to that in a second
but this if you use on a regular basis
is really good at just keeping blondes
very fresh and light so it doesn't let
your hair get too orange
or you know and sometimes your hair gets
a little bit coppery this really
prevents that from happening and it's
really good at just cleansing any of the
crap out of your color leaving it really
fresh and so on true it's also got an
anti fade complex so if you're really
good at using this a couple of times a
week it just helps to keep your hair the
color that it is when you step out of
the salon there is no point in spending
a lot of money and it is a lot of money
to maintain blonde hair and in the
salons there's no point in special out
and getting a lovely color if you are
just going to let it fade so this set
here or the shampoo and conditioner and
also which I'll talk about in a bit
these spray all of which help to really
keep my color very fresh and
yeah just as though it was when it came
out some they really love those two I'd
say I use this set maybe once a week
also once or twice a week I have been
using the Tresemme Elio radiant shampoo
and conditioner recently these are
soaking wet because I just grabbed them
out of my shower but these are kind of
an oil-based shampoo and conditioner
again I have just been trying them out
recently really loving them and I tend
to switch these kind of products in and
out of my hair care routine likes to
keep my hair alert and I don't like to
get my hair into too much too much of a
routine with the shampoo and conditioner
that I use about these a lot in my toga
favorites I'm not going to go into them
too much but basically they are an
oil-based shampoo and conditioner which
i think is great for this time of the
year when your hair just needs a little
bit more nourishment just to add that
shine back in so been really enjoying
using these ones recently and then
sometimes you want to wash your hair but
you don't really know what your hair
needs you just want it to be clean and
really light and fresh and for that I
use the John Frieda Beach blonde shampoo
and conditioner so this is the purifying
shampoo and the detangling conditioner
and I find that on those days when I
don't really have any particular
problems with my hair these are the ones
that I always reach for they always just
leave my hair really beautifully clean
very light at the top you know sometimes
your hair can just get a little bit
heavy I find that these make my hair
really light and fluffy but in a good
way
and then the conditioner is very light
again so you don't feel like your hair
is weighed down but it's really good at
detangling when I'm in the shower I will
normally just do one shampoo because I
do wash my hair every two days otherwise
it looks a little bit gross so you only
use one shampoo and then I'll always put
quite a large dollop of conditioner in
my hands I'd say maybe like three
walnut-sized and I know all the hair
dresses out there I'll be like no you're
using far too much but when you have
hair that you want this much and covered
in conditioner I just find that I want
to use quite a lot so I put a decent
amount of this in the palm of my hand
rub it from here downwards leave it for
about two minutes while I exfoliate or
just wash my body and I brush it through
with my Aveda hair brush this is a wood
and bristle hair brush it's a paddle
brush which I find is the best for my
hair line
and not eNOS my hair isn't so naughty
anymore now that it's in good condition
but when my hair was not in such good
condition and I basically couldn't get a
brush through it this was the only brush
that used to work for me it's really
light as well so I don't get arm ache
I'm brushing my hair which is definitely
a bonus when my color is in need of a
bit of a refresh I will always add in
this into my hair care routine this is
the provoked touch of silver brightening
shampoo and it is a purple shampoo you
guys I'm sure will know that purple
shampoo is really great for blonde hair
for really bringing it back to its
lovely bright white blonde if you ever
suffer from your hair going a kind of
like coppery color or slightly orange II
then you definitely need to add a purple
shampoo into your haircare routine and
the touch of silver is by far my
favorite I generally use anything else
from the range I know they've got
shampoo conditioner and conditioner deep
conditioner and hair sprays but for me
the shampoo is the only product that I
need so it says neutralizes brassiness
and brightens color in just one wash and
it definitely does do the job in just
one wash I'd say I use this I maybe
reach for this about once a month when
my hair just needs a real oomph of color
in fact I did use it on this morning
when I wash my hair so I think my hair's
looking a lovely kind of white blond
color again thanks to this and then the
other products which I will add into my
shower routine as and when I need it our
deep conditioners there's a few that I
really really like there is one from the
pure ology range and again from the
perfect for platinum range this is the
reconstructing masque equally the O's on
rare blend moisture therapy conditioner
both really really good when your hair's
a bit dry sometimes if I've been
overheating my hair using too many heat
appliances and the ends are getting a
bit brittle and straw-like then I'll
reach for one of these two if my hair is
in desperate need of a cut and I'm just
putting off going to the hairdresser
then I would use this one this is quite
a new one it's the l'oreal revive pro
fiber what's it called the long lasting
haircare system mask and it's actually
part of a really cool kit which i've
been using and actually going to use it
once recently but i'm already obsessed
with it it's basically the pro fiber
recharge kit and this stops you from
needing to
hairdresser so if you're in between cuts
and you just want your ends to be
refresh as though you've just been for a
trim then this is a really good
treatment to use there's three different
levels of this depending on how damaged
your hair is I've only got the lightest
level because the ends luckily are not
to damage we can go all the way up to
level three which is for very coarse
hair which isn't really really needs a
cut but you just want to help your hair
and to recover before you actually go
and get it cut and I find that when I
use these kits my hair is just really
soft really shiny and it just feels and
looked really well nourished so as well
as this I sometimes add in the shampoo
conditioner and serum into my hair care
routine all of which just work really
well together to make the ends of my
hair as good as they would be if I just
had almost lit ends trimmed off so
because of the amount of conditioners
that I use and deep conditioners and
hair treatments I'm really lucky I don't
get too many split ends which I know is
really rare for blond hair because
blonde hair is so fine and brittle it
does tend to split every now and then if
I do notice I'm getting a few spit ends
and I'll always go in with the L'Oreal
sealing Repair Serum so this stuff God
knows how it works is absolutely
incredible this almost works to bond the
split ends back together egg back
together again which actually sounds
like magic and this stuff really really
works I was so skeptical when I first
heard about it but I think I've included
this in favourites and autumn hair
survival kit blog posts but it really is
super it just it's a double it's kind of
like their foundation so you've got two
different serums in each side but when
you when you pump it there's there's two
holes in that and you get let me show
you you get two serums not sure you can
see a clear serum and a more creamy
thick consistency serum but you just rub
the two together in the palm of your
hands and drag it through the ends of
the hair so this stuff as I said I only
really use it when my hair is in
desperate need of some repair and it
just really really works and the game
means you can go a little bit longer
without getting your hair cut so trying
to do this in a slightly logistical
order after I get out the shower the
next thing that I do is put some
detangling spray in my hair
and there are two products which I
absolutely love for this and it's one
again from pure ology this is a perfect
for platinum miracle filler treatment
now I'm not sure why it's called miracle
filler and says fills gaps in fragile
porous hair okay so that's probably
describes that probably explains why
it's so detangling if it fills gaps in
pores hair and probably it definitely
helps with why my hair is becoming a lot
more shiny recently but this i spritz
all over my hair I really lift it up get
it into the roots and cover my wet hair
and this and after the shower or and
this is what I used before the pure
ology and I still absolutely love this
one this is really good for when your
hair needs a bit more nourishment and
it's see Schwarzkopf burner cure hair
therapy oil miracle this is a thick oil
and keratin restorative conditioning
milk so my hair and after I get out the
shower I can't really do anything with
it unless I do put some kind of
conditioning spray into it so I always
use one of the two without fail on my
wet hair and also I'll add an oil into
the ends I used to be a lover of John
Frieda Frizz Ease and I still AM but
I've been trying to switch it up a
little bit recently I then will switched
over to Lori llv oil and again
absolutely love that one but the two
that I'm using at the moment are these
two this is the red can at Diamond Doyle
and I'm not going to lie I chose it
because the packaging is really cute
it's like a pink diamond and it's quite
a watery oil so as soon as my hair is in
reasonably good condition at the moment
I don't need a very thick oil to put
onto the ends of wet hair and also the
L'Oreal mythic oil and this is a really
cool bottle it's like a black bottle
with a pipette slightly different to the
old mythic oils and again it's quite a
light oil so it doesn't weigh down the
ends of my hair so once I've got the
conditioning spray and oil through the
ends of my hair then I will brush it
through and again I'll be using my
evader brush honestly I didn't think I
could ever be so in love with a hair
brush but this is just so light and it
works so well a detangling I really
really like this hair brush so
completely brush all the products
through my hair so it's really evenly
distributed and then I'll move on to
blow drying if I am doing a proper
blow-dry
I'm not just going to be chillin at home
then I use the mind bone styling spray
and this is from the Schwartz cops got
to be range this is so good if you're in
a rush or if you just really need your
hair to be styled once it's done so this
has got some kind of ingredients in it
which not only speeds up the blow-dry
but also helps to hold your blow-dried
style in place so it's a very watery
consistency so it doesn't add any weight
to the hair I will spritz this all over
again brush it through before actually
blow-drying my hair if I'm not going out
or don't need to do anything fancy in my
hair then I'll skip this but it is a
really good product and great for
speeding up for blow-dry process the
blow-dryer that I use is this one is the
GHD I think it's called the G HD air or
it could be the aura I'm not sure I will
link it down below but I've got this
from look fantastic and it has the
copper
or rose gold details on it so it's
beautiful and it works really really
well I remember the days when I didn't
have this and blow-dry my hair just took
so so so long if you have long hair or
thick hair and you take forever when
you're blow-drying I highly recommend
this hairdryer it is honestly changed
the way that I style my hair and the
speed that I have the speed that I can
blow drying my hair so yeah I really
really like this hair dryer I will
normally blow dry by flipping my head
upside down and giving a real rough
blow-dry really getting into the roots
and all the way down to the ends and
then when my hair is about 50% dry I'll
introduce this bad boy which is I think
at resume yeah at resume barrel brush
and I won't really properly blow-dry my
hair I'll just kind of use it to you
know just dry it down at the ends and
use this as basically like a hair brush
and it's just really good at you know
separating out the hair so that it's all
evenly dried sometimes when my hair is
blow-dried I would just leave it at that
and tie it up in a bun my favorite thing
to do is use one of those big hair clips
tie it up in a bun and let it kind of
finish off drying naturally but on the
occasion when
I do want to do something with my hair
then there are two things for there are
two things which I always use so most
the time when I finished blow-drying my
hair I will blow-dry it to about 85 or
90 percent dry still a little bit damp
on the inside because I find it just
dries my hair out too much if I
completely blow dry it completely bone
dry
but when I'm at that stage I'll add a
couple of drops of the Bumble and Bumble
hairdressers invisible oil this just
really helps to tame any flyaways and if
I'm leaving my hair straight and I've
not done anything else - after
blow-drying this will just make the
condition look a lot more cared for
instead of having a bit of a light afro
because if I didn't put anything on my
hair to blow drying it would just be
quite um quite puffy eyes just say so
this just helps to tame any flyaway
hairs and make sure the ends are looking
nice and glossy I've been using this
full honestly over a year now and I'm
still only this much through the bottle
you only need one pump even for as much
hair as I have and it just does the
trick so absolutely love this stuff and
will forever repurchase so when I do
want to make some effort with my hair
and not just leave it on natural there
are two appliances which I use for this
and the first one will come of no
surprise if you've watched any of my
recent videos because I've been going on
about it so much and it's the lorry out
steam pod I use this um nearly every
time I wash my hair and my hair is 95%
dry and it basically straightens the
hair with steam I'm not going to go on
about it too much because I have
mentioned it in so many videos recently
if you do want to find out more about
the steam pod and why I use this instead
of my normal or my old hair
straighteners then definitely check out
my full video review of this down below
but yeah I use this most of the time
when I just want my hair to be straight
and not frizzy but as I said in my
review videos of the steam pod I wasn't
chucking away my hair strainers because
sometimes and that they're too bulky I
mean you can't take them on holiday with
you sometimes I just haven't had time to
fill it up and I just want to use a
normal hair straighteners these are the
new ones from GHD I'm such a sucker for
hair appliances whenever there's a new
GHD styler out I have to get it so yeah
these are the new ones they have this
Riis wizard which is just you know when
you're curling your hair and you get it
all tangled and it's really awkward this
is just a really good hinged cord for
not getting it all tangled
which makes so much difference when
you're curling your hair the colors
themselves or strangers rather are
actually really really tiny so great for
traveling they're much smaller than my
old ghd's I had the Eclipse before and
they were just much bulkier and these I
find a really good at creating beautiful
soft curls and they have this cool new
technology and then which i think is
called the tri zone technology which
basically adapts to your hair type to
find the ideal heat so you don't need to
worry too much about heat damage because
it finds the ideal temperature for your
hair so you're not damaging your hair by
using your strength is too hot I used to
think that the hotter the straightener
the quicker I'd be able to straighten my
hair and that's not the case it's just
more damage for your hair so these have
got very clever technology in them and
they are unbelievably light and tiny I
honestly the most portable light
straighteners I've ever come across so
that's the bulk of my hair care routine
there's just a couple of other products
which I fling in every now and then
there's the evader thickening tonic this
is a really good product from those days
like today actually when my hair is
sitting quite quite flat on my head I
just add a couple of mists mists of
spritzes of this into the roots of my
hair and I find that it lasts for a
couple of days I really get some great
volume on my roots so don't use this
that often but when I do want some
additional volume this is always a
product that I go to and then hair spray
I don't use hair spray very often
because I find that I just prefer to
have my hair natural but if I've created
a really lovely style almost should
create some really nice curls on going
out for the evening and want my hair to
stay in place then I will use a hair
spray this is the Schwarzkopf bliss hair
spray so it's a strong glossy hair spray
so it does give your hair a little bit
more shine sometimes I find that hair
sprays can make my hair just fall
completely flat and lackluster but this
does add a little bit of shine in as
well as a hold I'm not like addicted to
this one I mean it's a really good
hairspray but equally Trez may ones that
come in the big black bottles I love
those I love
I ll net but this is just the one I'm
using at the moment so that is
everything I feel like that could
possibly be the world's longest video I
