morning routine video so my day usually
starts when my alarm goes off at around
7:45 in the morning which is a huge lion
for me because normally I'm up at the
crack of dawn so it's really nice to get
these few extra minutes in bed when I'm
on holiday first thing I do usually is
check my notifications while in bed
check Instagram etc and I would check
the weather but sadly I didn't have any
4G where our boat was moored up that
morning then it's up and out of bed I'm
really keen to just get up and moving
and make the most of the day so the
first thing that I do is my skincare and
simple challenged me to only use their
face wipes for five days while on board
the boat which was really convenient
because when you travel on a boat you
don't really have that much room with
your stuff so it was great to not have
to bring all of my products with me and
instead just use the face wipes I was a
little bit unsure as to whether they
would do the job properly but the great
thing about these new simple face wipes
is that they really do lift away or your
makeup and your dirt and impurities and
what's perfect for holiday is that they
even remove waterproof mascara so these
new face wipes have aqua lock technology
in them which basically means they don't
dry out so throughout this holiday and
actually the holiday before I used the
same packet and the last wipe was just
as fresh as the first one so here's day
4 you can see I'm using it every morning
to just clean my face a little bit I
also use them in the evenings to get rid
of my makeup and on the last day I even
took them outside and did my makeup
sitting with my feet in the water which
was really lovely and relaxing so over
the course of the 5 days using only the
face wipes as my skincare routine I
noticed how thorough they were at
cleansing my skin just as much so as my
very complicated routine which I use at
home so I'm probably going to switch to
using face wipes a lot more often
because I just so easy and without being
cheesy simple so the next thing that I
do is put some SPF 30 moisturizer on my
face making sure that I cover every
little bit
then I apply some cream to my body I
like to do this as early as possible in
the day so that it's got plenty of time
to really sink in before I hit the Sun
so I'm applying this cream lotion all
over my body once I'm in my bikini then
I'm not making much of an effort with my
hair as you can see my beach day routine
is pretty easy
my hair's quite fluffy the humidity
tends to do that to me so I'm just
getting it all out the way tying it in a
very quick and easy bun and also this
stops it from being on my back and
getting me too hot so a really easy
simple way to do my hair ready for a day
on the beach
I do like to put on a tiny bit of makeup
just so I feel a bit more human while
I'm on the beach but this is often as
simple as a little bit of eyebrow pencil
just to fill in those gaps and then
sometimes I'll put on some waterproof
mascara however today I actually have
individual lash extensions on so I don't
need to put mascara on but then I'll
always put on some lip balm too just to
keep my lips hydrated even better if
your lip balm has got some SPF in there
as well because then it protects your
skin on your lips
from sun damage then I choose my beach
dress for the day pack up my beach bags
with all my essentials including my
simple face wipes I take those to the
beach with me as well because sometimes
I like to just refresh my skin after
getting out the sea then it's upstairs
to the deck and I'm making myself a nice
green tea which is just a lovely way to
start the day it's a little bit
healthier than your English breakfast
and yeah just a nice thing to drink
while having a look out onto the port
and look at the itinerary for the day so
I enjoy my cup of tea while admiring the
view I think this day we were docked up
on the Greek island of Paris so I then
reach my laptop sadly it's um it's never
a real holiday for me so I'm just
cracking on with a few emails scheduling
in some posts checking that my blog post
has gone live but it's not too bad
because I get to enjoy that beautiful
view I normally spend maybe about 45
minutes to an hour just catching up on
things and then we leave the boats ready
to explore the local town
on this particular day there were a few
markets in town so we had a little look
at the local handmade produce they had
some olive oil and honey bars so lots of
different local handmade things and then
we stopped at a local cafe for some
breakfast I opted for some lovely fresh
orange juice and some pancakes with
pistachio ice cream because if you can't
have a naughty breakfast on holiday then
when can you so this was really really
delicious
sometimes I have breakfast on board the
boat but on this particular day I fancy
pancakes
then finally around 11 a.m. it's time to
hit the beach so I take off my sundress
kick off my sandals and get myself comfy
on the Sun Lounger where I'll probably
spend the rest of the day reading a good
book so hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I'll see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
