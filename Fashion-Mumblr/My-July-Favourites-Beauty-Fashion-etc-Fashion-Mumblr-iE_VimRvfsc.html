favorites video this month's favorites
is quite a random mix of products
there's some stationery some fashion and
of course some beauty so I'm not going
to ramble on too much I'm just going to
get right in that just had to move the
mannequin around because it was really
annoying me that it was slightly wonky
in the background
normally my background is blurry but I
lost the remote for my camera so I
haven't use my old lens at the moment so
apologies that I've gone back a little
bit with regards to video quality and
yeah I am wearing sunglasses indoors
because my hair is doing something a
little bit crazy today and I have been
out all day and that's just where they
ended up anyway let's talk about my
favorite things of July the first thing
is this beautiful 2016 black and white
diary which I got from Selfridges but of
course you probably recognize it it is
Kate Spade last year or this year I had
the cream one with the dots on it along
with every single other vlogger in the
world and I'm sure next year every
single blog will have this diary but
don't really care about the cliches
because I absolutely love it really like
using a diary I do actually keep all my
events and meetings in my phone but
there's just something really satisfying
about writing stuff down and I just
think it's beautiful so if you've never
seen inside a Kate Spade diary before
they have like a month in full on the
first few pages of each month and then
they have the weekly planner inside and
you can get one week for every two pages
in the rose gold when they used to have
a really lovely quote of the thinning of
each month but this one is just polka
dots I don't know if whether that's
because this diary is a little bit
smaller than the rose gold one but I
guess I'm just gonna have to live
without my lovely Kate Spade quotes at
the beginning of each month I do always
really hate spending how much money
these diaries are this one was 36 pounds
which is excruciating for a load of
paper but I just thought I'm gonna try
and keep this one in good condition my
last one is heavily battered hence why
it hasn't appeared on my Instagram
recently but I'm gonna really try and
keep this one in better condition
because it's so beautiful and pristine
right now and I would love to try and
keep it that way I will get all the non
Beauty favorites out the way so the next
thing that I've been
this month I picked these up quite
recently it is these gorgeous flat shoes
from Topshop so normally I don't wear
flat shoes because I'm very tiny I'm not
sure how tall I am but I'm not very tall
so normally I wear heels but I saw these
and I just thought they were the most
beautiful things there the score just
really lovely kind of tan brown suede
and then they've got little tassels
which you wrap up your legs and they
just look really really cute on it so
even though they're flats I have been
wearing these so so so much in fact the
outfit of the day which I am publishing
today if I publish this video on Sunday
is also featuring these flats so have a
little look at that and there's also a
surprise guest in that outfit with a
photo shoot because I filmed it with
Becca from it's like a rose and had it
old dog a Rupert joined in on the
photoshoot so make sure you check that
out I will leave a little link below the
next thing is the thing which I am most
excited to show you and is that this
incredible Chloe drew deep bag so no I
do not have the money to buy a real
Chloe drew bag but I found this on the
internet and as soon as I saw it I was
like oh you have to be mine and yeah I
absolutely love it I think this is the
most similar dupe that I have seen to
the actual Clary true bag it's got the
same kind of fastening with a pin that
goes through there and twisty lock
feature it's really really similar on
the inside but not exactly the same this
one's got a really lovely light pink the
leather on the inside and the same as
the Chloe bag you kind of tie knots in
the handles to attach it to the handles
if that makes sense and yeah I really
really love the coloring of this handbag
it's got the darker Brown with more kind
of neutral Brown at the bottom and then
a more orange brown on top I'm not sure
if Chloe do this color combination but I
think it's absolutely beautiful and the
best part of all is that it was under
fifty pounds so I'll leave a little link
below
it's an American website and I live in
the UK I think the shipping was free I
did order two bags so you have to wait
until your other bag I ordered but I
think that there was no minimum spend on
the shipping definitely recommend the
website that I got this wrong and
definitely have a look at it because
there's low
loads of things just like this next onto
the beauty products and the first thing
that I have is this sugar scrub now this
is Mandy Lulu why rituals and it is
probably the most amazing smelling that
scrub that I have ever tried normally I
find that shower gels generally small
way better than scrubs but this one has
got the most heavenly scent it's really
hard to describe I'm gonna see it's kind
of floral but sweet at the same time
when I say sweet I mean candy sweet like
it's very makes me just want to have a
whole bag of gummy bears it just smells
incredible so if you like sweet smelling
things then definitely give this one a
try it's very um the greens are very
coarse they're sugar grains so they do
melt down as you are in the hot shower
but it's got absolutely tons of grains
in it so if you like a real good scrub
then this one it's absolutely perfect
I've just realized it says frangipani
and rice milk so I'm guessing that
lovely smell is frangipani and Millia
it's not sugar
maybe it's rice but either way it's
absolutely lovely and I've been really
enjoying using this I've been really
concentrating it on my knees and elbows
and also that area of sunburn that I had
on my upper arm so my tongue has been
feeding quite evenly although right now
I have to say I have had a Vita Liberata
spray time which is why I seem to been
maintaining my holiday time but yeah I
have been using this once every week and
another thing that I really like about
this is that it kind of coats the body
and almost like an oil after you use it
so you don't really need to put too much
body lotion on after you get out of the
shower
in fact some mornings and I've been in a
rush and I've used this I've not even
bothered to put any body lotion on
because it's left almost like a really
light layer of oil on my skin which
makes me smell absolutely lovely for the
several hours after I get out the shower
and definitely repurchasing that's
because it is just the most have
anything in the world
the next product that I've been loving
this month is the yes to cucumbers face
wipes normally I'm not the biggest fan
of using makeup wipes to get rid of my
makeup but actually last week I wasn't
feeling too well during the week so I
wasn't wearing a huge amount of makeup
on my face if any and I really just
found that was reaching for these to
cleanse my skin if my skin
just getting a little bit hot and
bothered and I just wanted a quick
refresh then I used these and they got
really really cool just keeping my scent
which when you're not feeling very well
you just want to feel fresh and clean
and these certainly did the trick the
cloths as well are really really soft so
because I felt like my skin was a little
bit sensitive last week these just
really helped to cool everything down in
fact when I was poorly this was pretty
much the only skin care that I used the
whole time I couldn't even really be
bothered with oils or moisturizers I
would just use this it would leave my
skin feeling nicely moisturized not as
obviously moisturized as if I'd used a
moisturizer but you know it didn't leave
that dry feeling like some face wipes
can do and just overall left my skin
looking and feeling really lovely or as
lovely as you can with you're not
feeling very good but I'm gonna continue
to use these on days and I'm not wearing
as much makeup or maybe throughout the
day just as a refresher because it smell
good they feel lovely and I really like
them the next thing in my favourites is
a brand that you probably would have
seen in lots of other bloggers favorites
and this is the first product that I
have tried from Sunday riding and it is
the Artemis hydroactive cellular face
oil so the first time I tried this I
kind of got the feeling that it was
something a little bit special because
as soon as you put it in your hands
firstly the fragrance it's got a really
warming almost kind of herbal lemony
scent and I really really love any kind
of citrus scents but because it's got
that kind of horribly tinge to it it's
very warming and kind of relaxing to use
as well so it's a real luxurious treat
at the end of the day I used this when
I've cleanse my face just rub a little
bit between the hands and put it on like
you would do here I've just been patting
it on and just freely soaking in all of
the lovely fragrances from this oil but
as well as it feeling lovely and also
smelling incredible it's got loads and
loads of skincare benefits inside this
little bottle in fact the back of this
bottle pretty much reads like a list of
dream skincare ingredients you've got
ingredients which burns the complexion
terrifying
toning purifying cleansing fighting
redness fudge and premature aging
fighting inflammation and giving you
clean healthy glow and from with it now
I probably haven't been using it for
long enough to really say whether it
been making that much difference when
skin and a long one but in the short run
I really have been noticing that my skin
seems to drink it in and I think that's
a really good sign when your skin drinks
in a product because it really means
that your skin is taking in all the
ingredients that you end up with and
that your skin needs the ingredients so
my skin has certainly been loving this
and I found that I've just not really
had to wear quite so much makeup because
my skin the next morning has just been
looking really lovely and evened out so
normally I sometimes get a bit of
redness around my chin and even like
whiteness not not so much of an even
complexion around my cheek area but that
just seems to be a lot a lot better this
month I know I have got a bit of a tan
so that definitely helped but I also I'm
gonna be putting a lot of that down to
this fantastic oil another couple of
products which have been in my routine
this month have probably helped towards
keeping my skin reasonably fresh and
clean and blemish free and the first one
is the Clinique anti blemish solutions
BB cream now this is probably the
Ronnie's BB cream that I have ever tried
normally I find them like BB creams on
tinted moisturizers quite thick and
consistency and I can easily just pull
them on the back of my hand but this you
have to shake it up before you use it
and it really does spread out of the
bottle so if you've got white carpets or
any kind of carpet then maybe do this
over the sink because I really find it's
a very watery consistency so it does
tend to run but once you get it on your
face this is absolutely lovely the color
match that I have for this is completely
perfect for my skin at the moment I have
got light/medium which I'd say is
probably not as light as it sounds so
definitely make sure you swatch them I'd
have thought that would be like a medium
or dark medium because I'm quite done at
the moment but it's perfect match for me
in the light medium shade it's also SPF
40 so I really wish that I've got this
before my heartaches this would have
been a great one to wear on the holiday
I do you find that if I put any Sun
lotions on my face and I really breakout
so this has got all the anti blemish
ingredients in it probably some kind of
higher onic acid or salicylic acid I
don't know which I was asked in counters
and doesn't actually say but this has
been doing really well of keeping my
like hormonal spots at bay
haven't really had too much of an issue
with them this month Popham this one on
my channel don't
in sere but that fears complete
irregularity it's it's the only one at
home my face at the moment so let's just
pretend that's not there but yeah this
has been really really lovely for summer
days when I want something a little bit
lighter on my face and keeping any
blemishes at bay so highly recommend
this one if you have a few blemishes or
just want to keep your skin of blemish
free also on the anti blemish front I've
been using the new bare minerals blemish
remedy foundation now this is a new
foundation from bare minerals and it's
also held a consistency so if you loved
their original foundation or their matte
foundation then you're probably going to
really love this one as well I'm not
sure if it's out yet I will have to
double check and maybe leave a date on
the screen or something but this is
definitely worth purchasing if you do
suffer from blemish prone skin or again
you want to keep your skin blemish free
because it has got all those skin loving
ingredients in it that also let the skin
breathe because if you do have blemish
prone skin maybe your skin's a little
bit oily then your skin definitely needs
to be able to breathe when you've got
makeup on and sometimes a powder
foundation can clog up the skin a tiny
bit whereas this is a lot finer so it
really kind of keeps the skin feeling
fresh throughout the day I think in last
month's favorites or in my empties
videos I talked about how much I loved
the original foundation from bare
minerals just because it gives such a
lovely kind of airbrushed look to your
skin
even if you don't have any foundation on
underneath I know some people like to
use it just as a setting but for me when
I got back from holiday it was all I was
wearing on my face and this is the same
silence you can use this on its own or
you can use it just to touch up or maybe
set in place any concealer I've put
concealer on the blemishes around my
jawline and just set it in place with
this because it's really not going to
clog up the skin so not only has it got
ingredients that help fight the spots
but also it lets your makeup and skin
breathe so it's not going to make them
any worse
so my next Beauty favorites is the Estee
Lauder bronze goddess bronzer I never
tried an Estee Lauder bronzer before
until I tried this and first of all
absolutely love the packaging it's
humongous for one thing so you really
really feel like you're getting bad
for money with this and inside you get
the brush I've left the kind of plastic
thing inside because I don't really want
the brush sketching the bronzer want to
keep it all perfect so perfect for if
you want to top it up on the go really
handy but when I'm using it at home then
I don't use this brush I've been using
my big Bobby Brown bronzer brush just
because that's what I'm used to but as
you can see the pan is absolutely
ginormous there's loads and loads of
product in there so I really feel like
you're getting good value for money and
it's just the most beautiful shade it's
got tiny tiny shimmer flecks in it but
does not leave your skin shimmery at all
or I've not noticed it - so if you don't
like a sparkly face then don't worry
about the shimmer in here it's a very
warm brown shade so if you're phobic of
going Orange then really don't worry
about it with this one I've even been
using it for contouring because it's
such a warm shade but at the same time
it's really great for blending over my
whole face I'll tend to take an slightly
narrower brush and build some contouring
in and then I'll just swipe it all over
the face a really really lovely color
and then I also love that it has a
humungous mirror in the lid so perfect
for touching up on the go so it's really
useful to keep the plastic thing because
I know that with my NARS bronzer I
didn't keep the plastic on it and
basically the mirror is not useful
because it's got so much product on it
so with this one I'm definitely gonna be
keeping them plastic but in it to really
save this Marek's it's perfect for word
touch-ups on the go another one from
Estee Lauder and this is one of their
lipsticks it is their pure color envy
lipstick Rouge in number 320 which is
defined coral and this is basically
being that the lipstick which I've been
wearing every single day this month
today is no exception it's what I'm
wearing right now and as you can see
it's just really gorgeous
I'd say red / coral I can't really get
away with a full-on red it's just too
dramatic for my face but this is a very
very warm Coralie it's really hard to
describe it's definitely somewhere
between a red and a coral but for blonds
or if you've got maybe like a warmer
skin tone then oh my gosh this is the
perfect shade I've probably not stopped
wearing this ever since the day that I
got it but still got loads left i which
absolutely love because I can't stand it
when you use it for a month you fall in
love with it and then it's all gotten so
there's still loads of this
which I'm really really happy about also
the packaging has got that really really
satisfying magnetic clicking finish to
it so always brings a smile to my face
when I put this away simple things but
yeah the lipstick itself it is not the
most long-lasting lipstick I've ever
tried but really long-lasting
considering how moisturizing it is gives
just a very subtle Sheen to the lips and
if you don't like that then you can just
blot it so some days if I've been
wanting a little bit more of an everyday
look then I've just been blotting my
lips a little bit more and it just gives
them more of a flat color whereas if I
don't blot it then it really gives a
nice shine but not too in-your-face kind
of super glossy I really do suffer in
winter with quite dry lips so I'm
definitely gonna pick up a few more
wintry shades of this when it comes to
kind of autumn winter lipstick time
because I think that the level of
moisture in this will really just keep
my lips from becoming all dry and
cracked and it's really gross but um
yeah hopefully keep my lips from
becoming too dry in the winter so
hopefully they'll bring out some nice
berry or dusky kind of Pink's which I'll
definitely be picking up because so far
absolutely love the formula of this love
the color love the packaging just love
and then the last thing in my favorites
is the makeup forever smoky extravagant
mascara I have to say I really quickly
judged this mascara and didn't think it
was gonna be very good because I just
didn't really like the packaging now I
know that's so bad just to judge a
product on the packaging but I think it
looks just quite cheap and it's very
boring black and white and yeah yeah
nothing really too special about the
packaging so I almost didn't try it like
how bad is that I almost just gave it to
a friend or something but I'm really
glad I did because firstly the brush is
just incredible I have never seen a
brushes shape before and it's basically
you like and upside down I really have
no idea how to describe this brush shape
but basically this brush is the perfect
mascara one shave I don't know why every
mascara wand isn't this shape it's
really plump at the top and then goes
down to a tiny point in the bottom which
is exactly what you need on your lashes
you just want it to be really big and
bold on the outside and then narrow on
the inside to really get those little
lashes it says on the back dramatic
impact and graphic precision which I'd
say is exactly the result that I
nice mascara it's also really good if
you want to just add more throughout the
day so I've been just layering and
layering there's mascara on and it
really is so good so I feel really bad
for judging it too quickly because I
pretty much hands-down would say this is
my favorite mascara right now and I'm
sorry makeup forever I was quick to
judge you but now I love you and so
that's it that is all the things I have
