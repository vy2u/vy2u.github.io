5 today I'm spending all day at home
which is long overdue I've got quite a
lot of things I need to crack on with
whether it's video editing or just like
life admin in general I kind of I'm
gonna be working a little bit this
weekend so treated myself to a bit of a
morning off I just had a lovely long
bath I don't normally have baths in the
mornings normally just kind of before
bed to really wind down but I thought
you know I'm just gonna have an hour or
so to myself although I did edit the
vlog that was seen yesterday
um at like 8 o'clock this morning it's
not really into childen morning but
that's just me
feel like I look a bit like Draco Malfoy
today because I haven't tried my hair
properly it's just doing not drinking
out of way he's the dad lucy's Malfoy no
comparison that I actually just found my
by Terry Baume De Rose toffee lip balm
in the back of one of my cupboards when
I was having little sought out and and I
completely forgot how much I loved it
I'm not wearing any makeup at the moment
apart from this and yeah it's just quite
a nice like a brownie color I'm very
very luxurious I've actually had since I
think since i snapchatted my makeup area
moving around because it used to be such
such a mess really
since i snapchatted when i redid it had
quite a few requests to do a makeup area
tour and while i don't think it warrants
a whole video i might actually give you
a little tour later on so I'm going to
be productive for an hour or so and then
I might give you a little tour around
this area here which is where I store
all my makeup so stay tuned if you want
to see that I thought I'd quickly show
you what we got in our goodie bags from
the lovely dinner last night with
Debenhams and urban decay so it's all
for the launch of this bad boy which is
the Queen Stefani palette if you've not
seen it before it's just the most
beautiful colors you've got some really
lovely quite natural ones a guy named in
lipstick which is really cute yep
wearing my casual leggings so yeah
you've got some beautiful neutral colors
I think this one and this one are going
to be my everyday is maybe a little with
this on the crease it's kind of like a
purplish shade quite similar to this one
that I
talking about where is that that I was
talking about in my autumn makeup
tutorial video yeah quite similar tones
to the back one's a little bit darker
but yeah that looks really lovely I
think this whole area I'll be using
loads of I'm a little bit phobic of
these guys but forgive them a go so yeah
that's the new Gwen Stefani palette
which is out now in debenhams this I
think is just a nice little little
voucher yep lovely thank you very much
Debenhams and then this I'm really
excited to try one of the girls Becca
was getting super excited about this
when she saw it in her goodie bag and we
all know she's the queen of highlight so
I've got high expectations if I could
get into it yeah I've got high
expectations of this and it's the Urban
Decay Naked illuminated shimmering
setting powder and Oh My lordy that is
shiny wow that is really beautiful and I
think there's something there brush
underneath yeah a little brush as well
which is lovely
also what's this waterline eyepencil
urban decay eye pencils are COC the most
waterproof thing in the whole world so
love those and then these are my
favorite things I love Evon decay
lipsticks the texture of them is just so
perfect let's see what the shade of this
one looks like so this one is actually
called naked that's the shade and look
at this it's just the most beautiful
delicate pink color that's the doorbell
and then as well as the press release
there is a lovely little box of
chocolates at least I think they're
chocolates open up the price tag on and
this cute little kind of scandi wooden
tree decoration and the candy cane so
lovely selection of bits from the goodie
bag so thank you very much Debenhams and
Urban Decay so the postman just dropped
off these bits and bobs from next and I
think it's some Christmas decorations
which I ordered so I thought we could
have a little look through those
together so I've undone all the packages
and these are my lovely new pieces from
next so I've got loads of bits for the
home this is one of the reed diffusers
I've tried reading --next diffusers
retun extra pieces next three diffusers
before and I didn't actually find it was
very strong but then we went to
Charlie's mums
and she had I think was the London was
it London like this packaging but London
and it just smelt really lovely so I
decided to give it another try and so
far this smells really really lovely and
it's quite a quite a chic design with
the black reads so got one of those then
we got some of these flickering they're
not real flames but I think they look
really realistic they're these battery
operated ones and there's three in the
box with these lovely gold sparkly
snowflakes so I think they look really
nice probably up on a bookshelf
somewhere and then for the coffee table
or even our dining table I just got this
really big gold sparkly one which is a
real candle and the scent of this one
and the scent of that one is quite piney
so it's just gonna really add to the
Christmassy smell in this room and then
lastly and these are definitely my
favorite thing of a whole little hole
there was actually four by put the other
two in the dishwasher already
these are little mulled wine glasses so
they're really chunky glass so perfect
when we have our Christmas jumper party
next weekend yeah really nice chunky
glasses fair isle print so lovely for
the mulled wine so yeah really pleased
with my little Christmas haul from next
also got a delivery from cafe latte
which I've not tried before so let's
have a little look what's inside of here
no no so let's have a little look Oh got
a scroll a little note oh very cozy
Dexter no can't do anything a year
around so it sent over a lovely cozy
pair of gloves these look incredibly
scrumptious and warm no monkey and then
a little bobble hat from ASOS with a
bubble which is the same color as their
branding very nice a little lip balm no
beastie uh-uh
come here cheeky monkey a little bottle
of Bailey's and you know what I actually
have never tried Bailey's before so
maybe I need to give this a go
and a lovely big scarf as well which
Dexter obviously really likes the look
of a nice Topshop scarf and I'm guessing
this might be coffee and last but not
least they have also sent three of their
cafe latte cappuccino iced coffees I've
never actually oh and they also sent an
ice block which keeping Dexter
entertained I've never actually tried
iced coffee before I have to be honest I
don't like the sound of it
I just I do like coffee but for me I
like that it's comforting and warming so
I will of course give this a go and let
you know how I get on Dexter obviously
nights look a bit no god you're being
such a hurry elegant nevertheless stop
it he'll meet me so it looks really
frumpy actually like a normal cappuccino
and then the lid is like a normal coffee
lips and I'll pop that back on that's
actually really nice it's kind of like
it's like what you would think a hot
chocolate would taste like but a cold
chocolate milk so I've just opened the
press release from the cafe latte
cappuccino things and they're running
our competition where if you share a
photo on social media I don't know if
it's Instagram or Twitter both oh yes
Instagram of your favorite way of
keeping cool during the cooler months
then use the hashtag stay warm keep cool
then they are going to send the best
ones a free collection of their
cappuccinos so yeah that's a fun one if
you want to try out the cappuccinos I
just this is my setup for my photo you
can see there I've just put it all on my
mother table this is not sponsored by
the way I just was sent these and I
thought I would tell you about it so we
are upstairs again and now I'm going to
show you my makeup collection I'm going
to try and make this quite a fun part of
vlogmas so I'm going to film it as
though it was an actual makeup
collection video so I hope you enjoy
so this here is my vanity station where
I keep the vast majority of my makeup
there's a couple of drawers here which
have got a different selection of
products in and then in this corner over
here you can just see it by the side of
my wardrobe is another desk of drawers
with also native products in it so first
of all let's have a little look at my
Moochie block so for the Muji drawers
I've got a total of six stacks of
drawers they come in sets of two and
it's I've got three sets of two um I got
these from Muji and then also from Muji
I have this little plastic set on top so
as you can see this is where I keep my
makeup brushes this is pretty much all
my makeup brushes except for a few which
I don't really use which I'll show you
in a second in this little section I've
got my so either at rose golden brushes
these are my newest brushes are
absolutely beautiful and to be honest
they're so pristine and new that I
haven't actually started using them yet
so I've kept them separate so that I
just know where they are and I can keep
them looking beautiful
this section is my smaller brushes which
are very regularly used some of my
favorites include this one which is a
Charlotte Tilbury powder and sculpt so I
use this one for contouring also these
two from zoeva
apologies they're not sparkling clean
but this is the one one-zero face shape
and the 142 concealer buffer and I use
these for blending in my concealer under
the eye and round face I also regularly
use my Too Faced eyeshadow blending
brush and Charlotte Tilbury eyeshadow
blending brush both really good for
creating an eyeshadow base and also in
here is a de liner lip liner brush I
think Delilah is really underrated when
it comes to makeup brushes but this is
definitely my favorite lip liner brush
and use it whenever I want to get a
really precise lip
then in this section which should
protect us away you can see more clearly
I've got my larger brushes in an
anthropological mug with a little J on
it so inside here my Charlotte Tilbury
bronzing brush is pretty much used every
day really love this one
then I've got a Sigma brush which still
has some masking tape on it from when I
did some filming for a brand but this is
a Sigma I think it's called the face
shape brush and I use this when I want
to do some quite precise powdering so
maybe if I'm using my hourglass ambient
light powder my livre 102 silk finish
brush I use every single day for my
foundation my Bobbi Brown a blusher
brush is another one which I use every
single day and then also in here some
powder brushes and other bronzing brush
and a contour brush which I use on quite
a regular basis but not quite every day
I also keep my Erin amber musk up here
just because it looks really pretty and
then in this section I've got some
pretty lipsticks and lipglosses from YSL
which includes their babydoll kiss and
blush in three different colors I also
keep a couple of my wire sell rouge
volupte shine lipsticks up there just
because they are so beautiful moving
down into the chores this first drawer
here is mostly lipsticks I've got my
Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks here I
wanted them on display because their
rose gold and absolutely beautiful my
favorite of all the Charlotte Tilbury is
sexy Sienna I wear this nearly every day
in the summer and it's such a lovely
consistency and color and the packaging
is absolutely gorgeous so I put my
Charlotte Tilbury style which I use
quite regularly quite OCD about them
being the right way around as well next
to the Charlotte chill breeze I've got
some Estee Lauder lip products here
starting with a couple of their lip
potion stains I've got a red one and a
more of a brownie taupe kendall jenner
kind of shade and I love these are
really long-lasting then a few Estee
Lauder lipsticks as well which I keep
lined up
I can see the name along here and behind
them I've got a few lip products which I
use quite regularly including my Sephora
luster matte lip color in the shade fig
I think it's fake fig laughter or
something and some more barmy products
and then I've got the Rimmel I think
it's apocalypse apocalypse which is a
really super deep for the Chanel lip
stain the next drawer down is even more
lipsticks starting with a few from Tom
Ford including these really cute tiny
ones which are from their lips and voice
range the absolutely miniscule but I've
got a couple of those then we have
Elizabeth Arden and these are Erin ones
and a couple more wire sell lipsticks as
well again in the back section some more
random lipsticks I've got an old stars
from our one Bobbi Brown some L'Oreal
Urban Decay quite a mixture in the back
of that the next drawer down is mostly
eye products so I've got a few of these
benefits eye creams and some quite
lovely neutral colors these I'd say are
my most used single eye products so
we've also got is everyone from Clarins
which I use really regularly especially
for highlighting the brow bone this is a
really gorgeous one which I haven't
really used that much from Burberry then
we've got some from Dior another Clarins
and some lovely barium glitters so this
is where I keep most of my eyeshadows
single products down here this is my
concealer drawer it's going to move the
candles out the way so you can get into
here so I've got the vast majority of my
concealers in here ranging from Bourjois
if their radiance reveal concealer and I
really have been loving using that one
recently
this is Benefit boying a really good
very strong concealer for any pesky
marks which don't seem to vanish and
then I've got my under-eye concealers of
which I have loads because you guys know
how I hate my under eye area and
like ones like by Terry of course NARS
creamy concealer and in good old wire
sell two o'clock so this is where I keep
all of my concealers next drawer down
and there's no particular order to these
drawers it's just how they are
you can see as my mascaras so I've got
quite a selection of the scars in here
one of my newer ones includes the bad
bits of Ariel primer so this as you can
imagine is like a brown mascara which
you put on before your normal mascara
and it just perhaps eyelashes to make
them nice and chunky and then you can
top it with either the brown or which
doesn't seem to be here and I've got
some fun unique another benefit they're
real the Clarins ultra waterproof this
is literally the most waterproof mascara
in the whole world
so yeah - Cara's are here and then along
the front here leaving a few diddy
handbag sized ones which i rotate in my
handbag finally in the bottom drawer
this is eyeliners and kind of eye
crayons so we've got liquid liners
ranging from collection fast stroke a
couple of these kind of gel liners
mostly from Bobby Brown then I even got
things like my flash card liners in here
the eye bright which is again all of the
eye I've got some eye shadow crayons
this is an Elizabeth Arden one Charlotte
Tilbury so yeah mostly things are in
stick form or just eyeliners in the
bottom drawer so from the moody jaws I'm
going to take you down here to my
drawers these two down here I'll start
with this one because it's the
logistical way of the way that I apply
my makeup so in here I've got a range of
serums moisturizers primers and then a
few little odd bits and bobs in here so
this area is mostly things like on
before my moisturizer so I've got like
for example the Rennes instant firming
Beauty shot this lovely radiance
boosting serum from Ostia and a lovely
origins serum here we then have my
slightly lesser used moisturizers this
used to be the one I used
every day it's the Liz Earle repairing
moisturizer but it's nearly finished and
I've kind of been saving that till
summertime another serum which just
didn't fit in there anivia primer and
then we have some my favorite primers in
here like the Delilah underwear primer
and this is actually a little sneaky
glance as to one Elizabeth are generally
saying very soon I'm not sure how much I
can talk about it but yeah I've got a
little sample there which I've been
using and then here are some of my more
use moisturizers show that till wee
magic cream is the one I'm loving at the
moment and then when my skin is a little
bit more oily I love the Estee Lauder
clear difference moisturizing gel for
when I want some tanning I've got the
Clarins instant smooth self-tanning and
origins make the difference plus when my
skin just need some extra loving then
this section here is full of slightly
random pieces I've got a few Beauty
blenders and under-eye cream a really
good under-eye cream from darf and then
we've got things like tweezers and nail
items the key to the room some eyelash
glue so just a really random selection
of bits and bobs here then this is just
by kind of a strange area where I've got
teeth whitening strips under-eye potions
from the Urban Decay palette and then
these are like eyebrow shaping stencils
so I keep those venues and I regularly
but I keep them all slotted in there so
that's that draw then if we spin around
this drawer over here we've got a whole
load of foundations and highlighters and
powders so as you can see a pretty full
draw and here is the foundations that I
use on a very regular basis ranging from
my favourites which is a Rimmel match
perfection to some CC creams I love the
by Terry shear expert CC cream then so
much I don't use quite so much but you
know they're still there hourglass
immaculate finish foundation nearly
finished my bare minerals complexion
rescue some lighter textured ones like
Dior skin basically all my foundations
in this little top there and the odd
tinted moisturizer thrown in for good
measure
over here you'll see my eyelash curlers
Rose called tweezerman ones
which is just a bit of an oddity in
natural birth it's just where they live
here we've mostly got powders so I've
got their minerals blemish remedy urban
decay this is actually film-star bronze
not glow so you have just a selection of
powders in there and then in this tin
which is actually quite hard for me to
get to I have my highlights so I can
usually just about reach the Charlotte
Tilbury highlighter which is my most
used one as you can see absolutely
gorgeous both the packaging and the
product inside so that's my most used
but we've also got a few base
highlighters like these ones from
Clarins the hourglass instant light
powder and also some seriously good
budget highlighters like the revolution
baked highlight this is such a good
highlighter and yeah great value for
money so all my highlighters and similar
things to that are in this little box at
the back this was actually a biscuit tin
from biscuit ears and you might be able
to guess this is a glossy box thing so I
don't really have any proper storage
boxes in there just kind of made doom so
we're going to whiz around now to this
chest of drawers which is hidden between
my wardrobe and the walls so let's have
a little closer look in here so on top
as you can see I've got some perfumes
these are my most worn I've got the Tom
Ford noir by self that OPM also some
German own favorites I've got
pomegranate noir and wood sage and sea
salt
this is just a neon room spray which I
keep there my nukes you know that golden
in the car and when it's called my Liz
Earle perfume a little Dipity candle and
then add your air flash foundation which
just didn't fit in my foundation draw
I've also got these which are the Ilia
false eyelashes which I've been using a
lot recently so they are just out on the
surface and then this is an incredible
set from L'Oreal so inside you'll see
I've just got absolutely loads of
lipsticks from the different ranges from
L'Oreal from the color riche ranging
from the pinks and the nudes to the Reds
so I keep this more as just a limited
edition kind of special occasion
box into the first drawer and as you can
see this is mostly lip products so in
here this is
all my lip liners it's actually in the
top of MU sunglasses box case so just
literally lip liners in there and the
lipstick which actually should be in
that one so yeah all my lip liners are
in this section here some of my
favorites include urban decay and also
even though it's been chewed by the dog
Topshop lip liners I absolutely love
here we've got kind of overflow lip
products so ranging from lipsticks like
my Delilah Topshop lip bullet which if
you've been watching me recently or now
I'm absolutely in love with this one
I've got some more in a masker um-hmm
so just lots more lipsticks in this box
here then we've got my bombs ranging
from the EOS balm Carmex by Terry
Elizabeth Arden just loads and loads of
different lip balms in this area here
and then this kind of hidden area at the
back here is slightly more random
products so if I move this out the way
you can see it more clearly this is a
really strange tweezerman item which I
don't really know how to use it but I've
got it in there anyway
got some tweezers this is a kind of evil
spot solution thing pencil sharpeners
primers you name it just kind of a
random selection of products and there
so let's go to the next draw down this
is mostly my palettes and eyebrow area
so this box here has gotten mostly my
eyebrow products in it ranging from gels
like the benefit gimme brow to my
pencils I love the Urban Decay ones Tom
Ford and then I've even got my pots brow
chilling here like the Anastacio so
that's all my brow products in there
this here is my most used bronzers and
blushes so we've got things like Estee
Lauder bronze goddess Mike hourglass
bronzer hourglass blusher Charlotte
Tilbury blusher these are just the ones
I use the most and underneath in this
section here is ones I don't use quite
as often but still want to have
available so hmm
meats and Clarins ones just all my other
bronzers and blushes in that these
little containers by the way are from
Muji and then this corner here is mostly
my palettes so I've got the Anastacio
contour kit I've got a lovely Clarins
eyeshadow set there this is the makeup
revolution blush palette which I love is
such good value my brand new Urban Decay
Gwen Stefani palette just lives at the
back there was still a little bit of
room for some more and then these are
some favorites including of course the
Stila palette we've got this one from
Becca I've got my naked 3 naked smoky
one from Too Faced so yeah just all my
eyeshadow palettes in it there and then
going down to the very bottom jaw and I
don't go in here too regularly so if we
take a closer look you can see that I've
got some face mists in this bottom area
one of my favorites is this one which is
the urban decay D slick makeup setting
spray a good you it is the makeup
revolution oil control but this one
smells a little bit more funny
then we've got some refreshing ones like
schon ich and caudally and the Body Shop
vitamin E I've got some face wipes down
here because you always need some spare
face wipes then here we've got a
selection of hand sanitizers these are
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works in the US I just
have a little collection of those then
I've got some perfume samples ranging
from these really cute ones such as the
bottles from Chloe and picture and roll
and the slightly larger ones here these
are Narciso Rodriguez another one
another picture and roll and you're not
sure if you can see at the back here but
these are kind of spare grippy things
for my eyelash curlers this is even more
perfume samples slightly smaller ones so
I always top these up in my handbag or
if I'm going away for just a few days
here are some eyelashes which I use
quite regularly I have got a box at the
other side of the Wardrobe with some
slightly less regularly used eyelashes
so even more from earlier
Ardell and more from alia and then
there's a couple of mini Macintosh
lashes at the back here and then finally
this is just one of these really cute
little emergency kits so it's got like a
breath spray and sanitary wipes you know
the kind of stuff just a little
emergency kits down in the bottom there
pretty much makes up my whole makeup
collection so you guys enjoyed having a
little look through that with me it's
been quite fun showing you and if it
changes in the near future
I'm probably not 100% happy with how it
is right now I think it needs to be a
little bit more organized then I will
definitely show you again so that was
fun hopefully you guys enjoyed seeing my
makeup collection I did it on my camera
on the tripod so hopefully the quality
will have been ok for those videos I did
have a few outtakes
I may have spilt stuff all over the
place so I'm going to insert those now
for your entertainment so inside this so
yeah I had a few little fails as you can
see now I'm gonna go downstairs and edit
some videos I'm not sure which one I'm
gonna put live tomorrow where I'm going
to do November favorites or Primark haul
but we shall see so yeah gonna go
downstairs and edit now another knock on
the door and I've just had a huge
delivery from Radley I do love my job
sometimes let's have a little look at
what is inside I'm doing a campaign for
them this Christmas so this is probably
the goodies for that so we've got a few
lovely little stocking and fillers
there's this very cute notebook with the
Radley dog on it I think this is just
yeah a plain lined notebook in a nice
hard shell and then because I wanted
some home gifts I got some of these nice
little tea towels and a matching scarf
with the Radley doggy prints on it
and in here is my leather accessory and
I've got this gorgeous purse it's such a
lovely kind of light stone gray with a
Bradley dog and a beautiful pink color
inside oh it's got two sections so
you've got that bit and like the walnut
section inside you're not a bad little
treats from Radley for a Friday morning
so I've just come to pick up my post and
all of this it's mine
and wrapping this to make at home so try
and I are having Chinese tonight it was
two mains and three sides for ten pounds
which is really good so I've got the
duck in the oven
Charlie's picking out the timing well
that's cooking I'm just snacking on
bread and butter is there anything
better than bread and butter in this
whole world I'm gonna unpack this stuff
from my daughter and which is kind of
like a p.o box you've probably seen my
snapchat but oh my god actually
ridiculous yeah I'm actually pretty
knackered I have been undoing at my blog
amount god I'm shiny excuse my lack of
makeup
I've been undoing my blog around for the
past like hour now and takes quite a
long time to put everything away I'm
quite OCD and I can't really relax until
everything's tidy but I got some really
really love you bet some of the brands
were really generous and send me some
nice little Christmas packages I'm just
going to show you if you have my
favorite bits and bobs so Estee Lauder
have this eyeshadow palette which the
palette itself is absolutely gorgeous
you've got some really lovely neutral
eyeshadows and one brow bone and just
you know the kind of colors that you
want to wear every day but what makes
this really cool is that you are
supposed to personalize your palette
with these little stickers and they're
actually doing that in their boxpark
store so I thought that's really really
good fun I'm gonna have a fun little
play around with those tomorrow that's a
nice little one from Estee Lauder glossy
box this is pretty cool so they
collaborated with blogger and youtuber
called really re and this box as you can
see is a rose gold which
we all absolutely love let's have a
little look what's inside for a lovely
helping cool ribbon so the packaging on
this one is just beautiful what have we
got inside oh I love these so this is
the bio cellulose second skin facial
mask I think it's yeah it's one of those
sheet ones which me and Charlie
absolutely love to do and then we've got
I think is this mascara or a
highlighting crayon from so Susan and if
I remember correctly I think this is one
of those lovely organic brands when
everything is very natural a cheeky nail
varnish in this nice light pink color
and then this looks looks for like the
bourgeois lip lacquer so I don't think
it is from de it's not messy is it
whatever it is its brand with a key
symbol and it's some liquid lipstick and
then we've got a caviar eye gel by
entree Belle I've not heard of that one
before
oh yes my favorites finally we have a
little product from dolphin essential
oil essential oil Alexia don't actually
know what that product is that's a
little look dolphin is probably one of
my favorite it's not my favorite
skincare brand of all time right up
there with Liz
I'll just love all their products under
6 rather lovely what's this oh my gosh
this is the nectar nectar flower oil
cream I am obsessed with this product
it's so lovely so it's a pretty new
launch and it's a kind of cross between
a cream and an oil it's just the most
heavenly scent and texture and it's so
nice on the skin so I'm definitely gonna
