Maldivian morning routine I'm also going
to share some post flight and jet lag
tips so hopefully they might come in
handy next time you travel the time to
friends here means that my body wakes up
naturally at around six o'clock in the
morning on this occasion though I really
don't mind the jet lag I put on my
slippers and head straight outside the
cache for semantic we're staying in over
water which has this incredible decking
area perfect for watching as the sky
turns into perfect pastel pink shade
while watching the Sun come up and
keeping hydrated with at least one glass
program this is so important when the
body is jet-lagged or after your journey
keep me going throughout the day and
also making myself a coffee I'm very
thankful for the espresso machine in our
room as you guys know I like to meditate
most mornings at home and it's no
different here in fact it's better
without you
today I'm doing a 10 minute meditation
on the head state map then I enjoy my
coffee looking out to sea I'm thinking
how incredibly lucky I am to experience
such an amazing place and see so much in
the world inside the villa my beauty
routine begins I'm using products from
the Garnier skin active range they're
affordable simple and give me exactly
what my skin needs first I'm using the
Garnier might look like Jessica I picked
up this handy travel size at the airport
and it's perfect for using wiling away
it's so quick and easy and the my soul
cleansing molecules act like a magnet
lifting dirt oil and make a clean skin
you don't need to rub it in either and I
even became a little bit into a tiny
bottle to need it while I'm on the plane
as well that is my favorite part if you
follow me on instagram scurries you
already know how much I love you believe
moisture Bowl sheet mask while I travel
and for good reason
that lag and long journeys through all
the moisture from the skin and in each
of the Guyanese connected marks you get
the same results as half essential as
hydrating a serum so my in hydrated skin
drink all in
I had outside I'm trying to catch up on
social media
the time difference here means I've got
half a day's work to catch up on and
then I take some selfies just because I
look so totally ridiculous when I remove
the mask I've had the access into my
skin all if there's too much I can just
use a cotton pad to wipe it away after
just 15 minutes my skin feels really
soft fresh and finally I've got my glow
back then it's breakfast time we enjoy a
scrumptious breakfast hours on the
decking I'm having a green tea first
then pancakes and fruit not the
healthiest I know but I'm on holiday I'm
just kidding you know I have pancakes at
least once a week at home
after brekkie i hop in the shower the
villa is supplied with aromatherapy
associate shampoos which I love so much
so I'm using that before coming from
olaplex to my hair to really deep
conditioned and protect ahead of day of
Sai exposure I'm brushing it all the way
through root to tip since getting my
hair bleach I'm using conditioning
treatments like this every few days to
combat breakage next it's some cream
fact the third uses absolute vanillin on
my face
although 50 is back and make sure I go
right my hairline and put plenty on my
nose as well I'm putting an all-day Sun
cream on my body but I'll top it up
throughout the day to just be exercices
makeup wise all I'm applying is a little
bit the waterproof mascara just to give
a little definition of my lashes present
at the beach I'm using a Garnier mineral
deodorant this one has 48 hour
protection and also absorbs humidity and
then it's out the door and I'm ready to
enjoy a day in paradise
the commute here definitely beats the
Northern Line and stroll along the
decking through the gardens and then
along the beach today we've got a
snorkeling excursion and then we're
going to borrow to paddle boards before
reading and relaxing in shade I still
can't get over the color of this water
the first time I saw it I didn't think
it could possibly be real this place
tree is heaven on earth throughout the
day to cool myself down my new beach
obsession is the Garnier moisture balm
hydrating this frame inside mentis but
it's also got an evolution filters and
SPF 30 great for cooling down and also
pressing up your sun protection so
that's my lord Vivien that morning
routine I really hope you enjoyed this
video and I'll see you in my next one
