morning routine it's no surprise that
we're hearing more about the importance
of mindfulness in improving our
well-being at the moment we're all so
busy it's important to press pause and
take time out of our hectic schedules to
look after ourselves at the weekend I
like to practice a full mindful moon
routine when I can spend a little longer
these rituals but I try to incorporate a
few of these little morning rituals into
my weekday morning routine as well I'm
lucky that I wake naturally is around
half 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning and I
don't really need an alarm I seem to
have trained my body into waking up this
early instead of checking my phone I
like to just wait with a purpose and
visualize my day ahead in a positive way
I find that by not checking my phone it
avoids any thoughts of self comparison
from checking Instagram and also any
stress and monkey brain from checking my
work emails next I pop on my
dressing-gown and head downstairs into
the kitchen I'm usually followed by a
certain someone as well once in the
kitchen I reach for a glass which is 500
mil and now I need to drink least 2
litres of water a day so I know that
this is going to get me off to a good
start drinking enough water is so
important to keep all the cells in our
body hydrated and working their best the
juice from the lemon also helps to keep
our acidity levels and balance
next I make myself a cup of tea you guys
know this from all of my morning routine
videos at the moment I'm loving this
brand positivity everything about that
branding is just so perfect for mine
from one routine the teas are made in
the UK now inspired by the chakras which
is the ancient Indian philosophy for
healing and living your life in a
positive way I like to take my tea
outside and just take a few breaths of
fresh air while enjoying nature while
outside I like to just take a moment and
be thankful for something positive it
can be something as simple as sleeping
in clean sheets but I like to start the
day with positive thoughts I then take
my team water back inside to continue
with my morning routine I head into the
bathroom where I'm going to pump myself
with origins new match a madness ritual
a tea face mask this is a face mask like
nothing I've ever seen before
you take complete control of the masking
process even mixing it yourself is the
first of a tea based collection from
origins inspired by the tea rituals from
around the world as well as the
ingredients rich well-being benefits so
perfect for a mindful morning routine
when mixed with water the power
transforms into an antioxidant rich tea
infused frothy cream the blend of tea
leaves and natural ingredients provides
my skin with a restorative and healthy
boost giving me radiant and healthy skin
for the day I add
I'm mixing the mask in the signature
non-slip callable and using the dual
ended tool to mix and measure and then
apply
while I enjoy wearing the facemask is
time for me to press pause and for me I
take ten minutes to meditate at the
moment I'm just using a podcast my seven
chakras I'm using these noise-canceling
headphones they've almost become a
symbol for me to totally switch off from
the outside world I press play get
myself into a comfortable position and
then just breathe and think of nothing
if possible for 10 minutes
Dexter is always by my side
while previously once seen as perhaps a
little bit airy-fairy
or hippy there's no scientific research
highlighting the importance of
meditation primarily stress management
improving focus and clarity as well as
in a piece a few of these benefits are
also seen in matcha so it's a perfect
match with my face mask - for me
meditation is so important because it
really helps me to focus which really
helps me during the week when I'm always
so busy multitasking and flitting from
task to task once the ten minutes are up
and remove my headphones and it's back
to reality by now my tea has cooled down
so I enjoy a few more slurps before
moving on to another invigorating part
of my morning routine these are my
one-minute rituals inspired by the
heyyou method first of all I just shake
I shake every part of my body for one
minute it feels totally silly but you're
alone at home so just have a laugh and
enjoy the moment the cilia you feel the
better shaking really invigorates the
circulation wakes up the muscles and
clears out any stagnation from the body
it's amazing how good you feel
afterwards next to invigorate my
energetic circulation I drum the body
with a loose fist I Pat my chest down
the outside and up the inside my arms
and legs around the abdomen lower back
and even on my head
this releases the muscle joints and
gently dislodges any toxicity held
within the body it also stimulates a
defensive energy of the body against
disease and improves the function of
internal organs I do each of these
exercises for around 30 seconds so it's
not much more than a minute in total
twisting also stimulates the kidneys and
awakens the digestive organs within the
body I twist at the waist and swing my
arms so that my hands slap my front and
back or kidney level the exercises are
so quick and fun and effective that you
really should try to do these once every
day next it's back into the bathroom and
before I hop in the shower
I apply the matcha madness body mask all
over my body you can allow yourself a
few more moments of relaxation for this
to sink in but personally I just like to
use it as a scrub within the shower once
that the shower is downstairs and I'm
going to take the time to make myself a
delicious and nutritious breakfast today
I'm making banana and oat pancakes from
the Madeline Shore recipe book I start
by mixing up some oats in my Thermomix
to create an oat flour before adding in
some cinnamon and banana into the
mixture
Charlie made some homemade almond milk
the night before so I'm going to use
this once again adding into thermomix
and blending then combining the
ingredients into a bowl and mix this up
to form my pancake batter
then for the kompot I'm chopping up some
fresh strawberries a handful or two and
adding them into a saucepan also in the
pan I'm adding some lemon zest and the
juice of half a lemon as well as some
runny honey then I heat the mixture on
the hob for about five minutes before
moving back to my pancake batter I heat
a pan and then add some coconut oil just
to make sure there's no chance of my
pancakes sticking to the pan I add the
mixture in kind of circles but you can
be a little bit messy here and then give
them a few minutes on each side until
they're golden brown then it's time to
serve up I made some for Charlie too but
his plate didn't turn out quite as
photogenic
once it's done I take my plate outside
during these warmer months I love to
make the most of the sunshine and enjoy
my breakfast on that outside table
doesn't take me too long to polish it
off in such a tasty dish and not bad for
you either then is inside and I complete
my usual skincare routine before
applying some light makeup for the day
my skin is glowing beautiful from using
the mask so I don't like to use anything
too heavy instead just some tinted
moisturizer for a little bit of light
coverage then some brown mascara for
very natural but volumize lash look and
a pop of pink on my cheeks to finish
then I rough dry my hair I'm still
totally obsessed with this dies in the
hairdryer leaves my hair feeling so soft
and conditioned and then I brush through
and use my L'Oreal steam pod to create a
little bit of curl and volume into the
hair I love that the steam pod doesn't
damage my hair as much as usual
straighteners but I can still get all
the starts that I love then it's time to
add the final details my jewelry my
perfume my sunglasses before packing a
bag for the rest of the day I'm heading
out to a local farmers market so all I
need is my purse a little snack bar and
a hair bottle just in case this windy
then it's time to get Dexter ready to go
as well look at his new Porsche lead he
feels very smart when he wears his
harness clip him in and it's out the
door ready to enjoy the day thanks so
much for watching and I hope you enjoyed
my mindful morning routine why not try
