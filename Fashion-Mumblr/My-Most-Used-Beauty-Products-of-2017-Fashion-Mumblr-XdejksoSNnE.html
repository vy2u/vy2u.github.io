me for today's video I'm going to be
talking about my most used and therefore
my most loved beauty products from 2017
last year I didn't really get into the
habit of doing regular monthly favorite
videos so this is all of those kind of
combined into one big video I feel like
especially towards the end of last year
I really didn't talk too much about
Beauty I just was really loving creating
fashion content and I guess I kind of
lost confidence in talking about beauty
products there are obviously so many
youtubers out there that do fantastic
makeup they really are incredible makeup
artists and I didn't really feel like I
had anything different to say or I
couldn't add anything to what was
already out there so I just really lost
confidence in doing Beauty style videos
but then I was reading loads of amazing
comments from you guys about what you
wanted to see and I realized that
actually you do like to hear what beauty
products I love from more of a kind of
everyday point of view a realistic
makeup routine if you will so I thought
I would share with you the products that
I used the most throughout the whole of
last year as you can imagine I do have
quite a lot of products and talk about
so I'm just going to go through them
quite quickly because I have mentioned a
lot of them on my Instagram stories on
my blog within vlogs etc so most of
these you're probably already know why I
love them but everything that I
mentioned will be linked down in
description box below as you can check
that out if you'd like any more
information and before I forget please
do give this video a thumbs up if you
would like more beauty videos from me
next year or this year rather and don't
forget to subscribe for loads more
beauty and fashion content I have so
many amazing videos coming your way very
soon so don't forget to hit subscribe if
you don't want to miss out on any of
those okay so in no particular order I'm
going to get started with nails now this
year I mostly got my nails are done with
shellac I went to my usual nail salon
which is the London grace salon on car
from High Street that is where my nails
are done
the time and a lot of time when you
asked me where I said no lunch bran is a
shellac color from there usually when
it's that nudey pink its satin pajamas
at the moment I have a slightly more
festive kind of like a rose gold
metallic II they are by far my favorite
place to get my nails done I always find
that the shellac looks great and lasts
so so long and it's just a really nice
vibe in there too so if you do live in
London highly recommend those salons but
I also have some nail varnish favorites
when I didn't have gel on my nails this
year chances are I had this it is from
the sy Hansen color therapy range and it
is their powder true nail varnish a
really beautiful light pink with a
little bit of shimmer quite a pearly
color and I got so many compliments when
I was wearing this the range itself is
infused with argan oil so really really
good for your nails which makes it
amazing for those times when you want to
nourish your nails in between shellac
gel manicures I also for that reason
really loved the argan oil oil from the
Sally Hansen range this is double O 5
it's just their cuticle oil and I just
nourish this into my cuticles most
evenings to keep my nails healthy so
those are two favorites as well as my
London grace gel manicures next I'm
going to mention a few hair favorites
next I'm going to talk about a few of my
hair favorites nothing has really
changed when it comes to my pure ology
perfect for platinum miracle filler
treatment I spritz this on my hair as
like a leave-in conditioner nearly every
single time I wash my hair I find it
makes my blow dry quicker helps the
condition of my hair which is very
important because I do get my hair
bleached and colored so anything that
conditions the hair is amazing I've used
this for at least two years now and I am
a huge huge fan alongside that and in
products which not only smells great but
also it's fabulous for detangling it's
actually not this particular product but
I have run out of the walnut that I
wanted to talk about this from the same
range it's the Weller SP luxe oil so
what I like to do is put a couple of
pumps of that into the palms of my hands
and then rub that through the ends of my
hair when it's damp meaning that I can
brush my hair a lot more easily and it's
also really good if you've got dry hair
and you just want to make your hair a
little bit less frizzy in fact I could
probably do it a little bit of it now
but it is a fantastic product and one
that is on the top of my shopping list
2017 for me was
that I discovered the LMS pro-collagen
marine cream now this oh my god I just
flung this across literally just caused
a Domino's of all of the makeup products
on my table so 2017 was the year that I
discovered the LMS pro-collagen marine
cream and I know so many people are huge
huge fans of this and last year's year
that I really discovered why I really
just enjoyed using this because it sunk
into my skin so quickly provided all the
hydration that I needed and it's also
anti-wrinkle as well I am 26 not that I
really need to usually worry about
protecting myself from wrinkles but you
can now start too early and I just felt
that my skin had a great texture it felt
really firm it felt plumped so felt
hydrated this is actually their breast
cancer edition of the tub they raised I
think it was over 90,000 pounds from
breast cancer awareness with this which
is so incredible and it's the gorgeous
big pink tub so this was a favorite
moisturizer of 2017
also from the same range from Elemis is
their pro-collagen advanced eye
treatment this I really like the fact
that it's a handy little pump disperses
the exact perfect amount and it's a very
lightweight eye cream I have quite
dehydrated under eyes and they tend to
get quite puffy
if I use anything too thick anything too
creamy Charlie swears by the kills
avocado eye cream but personally for me
creamy products like that are just a
little bit too too much product for such
a delicate under-eye area this is almost
watery and consistency so very very
lightweight and I really do just gently
tap this in and I find that especially
when I have dehydrated under eyes like I
do now I'm very dehydrated at the moment
from all the naughty things I ate of
Christmas this is the eye cream that
really it helps with that and for that I
am very very grateful so one of the
products that was flung across the room
when I dropped the Animus was the clinic
pep start lip balm so insert an overlay
of it here's to can see what it looks
like but that was one of my favorite lip
balms this year and I used it nearly
every
all day since getting it in around
Wilbur September time when I was just
starting at my makeup routine so in any
of my makeup videos you'll have seen
that what I like to do is apply a lip
balm at the very start of my makeup
application and then I tend to blot it
off or in case of that one you sometimes
don't even need to and then apply the
lipstick on top so the Clinique lip balm
for me was the best lip balm for priming
my lips it wasn't too kind of goopy and
glossy so it really did just nourish and
sink into the lips and ensured that my
lipstick looked great all day long
sometimes when I needed a little bit
more nourishment like in the evenings
and I wasn't planning on putting any
makeup on top
I'd use something a little bit gloopy
err like the Liz L super skin lip balm
this one also has a plumping effect as
well but doesn't irritate the lips in
the slightest it's the naturally active
ingredients which help to plump the lips
but this one I felt was the most
hydrating and nourishing when my lips
really needed a big hit of moisture I
can't not mention the by Terry Baume two
rows as well on those days when just a
lip balm on its own was enough this
would be the one that I would reach for
most of the time when I'm working from
home I would have this on my lips and
the color that I have I absolutely adore
this color it's so beautiful it's like a
brownie nude which as you know it's my
favorite color
when it comes to lip products and it is
the shade toffee cream it's just so so
beautiful so nourishing it smells great
it's just such a beautiful product I
love the packaging I really love by
Terry as a brand I want to try it a lot
more from them in 2018 because a lot of
the products that I've tried from them I
absolutely adore and this is one of my
all-time favorites I realize I've jumped
about a little bit when it comes to hair
products but I do have a shampoo and
conditioner that I really loved using
this year so when it comes to shampoo I
discovered the L'Oreal LV extrordinary
oil fine at coconut oil range maybe and
around August when I actually did an
Instagram campaign for them I'd already
bought the products and wanted to try
them out before I was approached about
the campaign so I said yes straight away
I knew how much I loved them this is
probably my fourth or fifth bottle of
the shampoo I find it so nourishing but
it's not heavy it isn't way to hair down
and it's a really big bottle I feel like
I'm getting great value for money with
this and the smell is amazing I'll
always now associate this with the
maldives
I only took this shampoo with me the
more the
and it's just such a beautiful smell it
smells kind of perfumed like not really
coconutty it's just a very luxurious
fragrance and does amazing things to
your house I highly recommend checking
this out if you haven't already there's
also a mask and a conditioner from the
range to which I also love but my
favorites conditioner from 2017 is this
one is the catwalk by TG fashion astir
violet conditioner and I get a lot of
questions about how I keep my hair this
kind of ashy silvery almost gray color
and I honestly would highly recommend
you investing in a purple conditioner
and the one that I find affects my hair
color the most is this one from the
catwalk by TG fashionista range if you
have got blonde hair or highlights and
you want to maintain that beautiful
almost white creamy color the Misses on
I would really recommend what I would
suggest you do is actually leave this on
your hair for about 5 to 10 minutes let
the conditioning work its magic but I
also find that that length of time
let's the toning ingredients in this
really help to change the color of your
hair and another couple of hair products
that I really really loved using in 2017
and I will continue using as of most
these products throughout the next year
is possible invisible we can't not talk
about invisible when it comes from most
used products of the year I probably use
these in 2016 as well I don't think I
discovered them in 2015 but once you
start using invisible hauls you really
won't go back to normal hair bubbles
they're just so easy to take in and out
your hair isn't getting dotted around
them even if you're on the beach and
you're going jet skiing I'm trying to
think of a scenario where you're having
be going crazy in salty water they just
don't get knotted into your hair they
don't break your hair they look really
cute too I think it's almost
embarrassing how in so many of my outfit
photos you'll see an invisible on my
wrist this one is my favorite it's quite
stretched I heard a rumor that if you
put them in boiling water they shrink
back to normal does anyone tried it if
you have it please let me know maybe
I'll just try it after this video and
I'll leave a comment on the screen now
as to whether it works or not and but
this one's my favorite it's light pink
and it's got this gold disc on it and
this was the breast cancer Edition that
they brought out in October and I
I love it and a final half favourite
this year I really loved using wet
brushes
kind of gross this one has just come out
my handbag has a couple of Harris on
there but wet brushes for me are really
super because they don't make my hair go
static which used to be a problem when I
used normal paddle brushes and they are
so good at detangling this one I keep in
my handbag if I ever stay over maybe
Charley's parents house where I don't
have a hairbrush bag then this one is
great if I want to wash my hair and then
rush through it without it being at such
a nightmare to detangle okay I'm going
to talk quickly about a couple of
cleansers I've mentioned both of these
loads of notes before so very quick
mention of these the Garnier micellar
water which is the oil infused one has
been my favorite my soda water of 2017 I
think I use this almost every single day
last year it's just so great at taking
your makeup off it feels really lovely
and nourishing to the skin because of
that oil infused formula and you can use
it on your eyes on your lips it takes
off even lips stains it takes off
waterproof mascara sometimes I would go
in with another eye makeup remover as
well but I very very rarely needed to so
that was always my first stage of
cleansing I always bought the little
mini versions stay with me on holiday
too because I just can't live without
this and then I also of course used my
little cleanse and polish a lot this
year I mentioned this so much it
probably must be boring for you guys
this one is the sweet orange and clove
scented one which is just such a
gorgeous addition for this time of year
especially it smells so divine a really
lovely pampering products so many of my
friends now and totally hooked on this
since I recommend it to them if you
haven't tried it yet make it your news
resolution in 2018 to give this a go
next up I have to mention it the Garnier
Ambre Solaire
no streaks bronzer self-tanning dry mist
for the face I've used a lot of tanning
products this year I love to be bronzed
but when I thought about the product
that I use the most and repurchase the
most it is probably this one I always
find that my face gets pale a lot
quicker than the rest of my body whether
that's from a real tan or from a fake
tan so I found myself at spritzing my
face or just lightly misting my face
with this maybe three times a week over
the year just to maintain that lovely
color I found this really buildable as
well it doesn't have any nasty smells it
just gives you a really lovely flawless
tan and it's just so easy to do you can
probably do it over makeup
just such a super fine mist really great
for topping up the town whether it's on
your hands on your face and yeah so easy
to use super affordable highly recommend
next another spritzing product this is
the Armani Prima refreshing makeup fix
so I use this most days when I wanted to
set my makeup and create a really lovely
Julie complexion now I wouldn't wait
until the end of my makeup application
to uses the word tend to do is apply all
my cream makeup products so my
foundation and concealer any under-eye
products and then use this instead of
using this after I've applied bronzer
lipstick eye shadow and things like that
that was how it worked best for me just
really kept my makeup looking fresh dewy
and healthy all day long and also it's
just a very refreshing mist as well if
you wanted to give your skin a bit of a
boost in the middle of the afternoon
where you starting to feel like you need
a coffee your skin needs a bit of a wake
me up then this is really good for that
too so I have a little cluster of
lipsticks here these have been my
favorite lipsticks of 2017 I will start
off with one which could have gone in
the balm category because I tend to use
this as a balm it's usually in my
handbag on cold winter walks if I'm out
shopping or whatever I would tend to pop
this on when my lips feel like they need
a bit of nourishment but I still want
them to look really good this is from
the girl and patear my range which does
mean that it has a beautiful fragrance
like the petite robe Noire perfume and
it is their route 11 lipstick in the
shade 11 a very neutral soft pink color
slightly Brown II but very very wearable
and very nourishing just like a balm but
with a little bit more of a tint of
color so I've been using that a lot I've
almost definitely repurchase this in
fact I want to find out if they've got
any more shades maybe something slightly
more Brown you for autumn/winter and if
I go skiing this year as well this will
definitely be one that goes with me in
my ski jacket pockets it's just super
super nourishing next up is a lipstick
from the Victoria Beckham Estee Lauder
range this is the Brazilian nude
lipstick a very very flattering pink I
found that on a lot of days on
wasn't too short kind of lip I wanted to
go with and wasn't willing to commit to
a red or a really deep brownie pink then
this is the one that I would go for it's
almost like a your lips but better color
and looks really beautiful with the
Victoria lip liner which is coming up in
a second
also from Estee Lauder another really
nourishing almost barmy consistency is
the pure color Envy lipstick in the
shade insatiable ivory Oh Samia run out
I'm actually wearing this at the moment
as you can see it has a little bit of a
gloss to it if you just apply it and
leave it but what I also love to do is
block this and use it a little bit more
matte a lot more long-lasting this I
wore throughout pretty much the whole of
spring and summer again with a lip liner
really really beautiful and very very
comfortable to wear on the lips I did
want to mention that the Fleur de force
matte lipstick because again I will that
so much it was probably my dream
lipstick shade well done Fleur if I was
to create a matte lipstick then that is
the color that I would go focus it was
so stunning I could not find that
lipstick when I was rummaging through my
makeup collection to film this video so
I've grabbed fell that teddy
just to show you and just remind myself
to talk about it I'm pretty sure it's
going to be in the bottom of one of my
handbags fingers crossed that I can find
it because I love that lipstick and as
you may know it is sold out it was
limited edition so I won't be able to
get it again but hopefully I can find it
I just realized that my memory card was
full and I've been talking to myself for
the last 20 minutes so it's stress
avoided I tied my hair up because I was
what I'd do in stressful situations
let's continue so the last thing that
recorded was my lipsticks and I was
about to tell you that the most one nip
stick for me of 2017 that you guys will
not be surprised to hear is the Tom Ford
sable smoked lipstick now for me this is
just the most entering me shade ever it
is so perfect it is brownie pink shade
which you have seen me wearing in 90% of
my blogs blogs Instagram stories etc etc
if you ever see me out in the street
chances are I'm wearing this I
absolutely love love love this lipsticks
so much color is perfect the form is
perfect
it's nicely nourishing so it doesn't dry
out the lips but it's also very
long-lasting I do not have a bad word to
say about this it is Tom Ford sable
smoke and I love it with most of my
lipsticks this year I've also worn a lip
liner 2017 has really been the year of
the lip liner for me I never really wore
at much before last year but I did a lot
this year two different lip liners which
I love so much firstly the Rimmel
exaggerate lip liner in the shade 0-1 8
which is addiction this is very
affordable and the most beautiful color
it also doesn't need sharpening you can
just twist it up and it's a perfect
pinky nude I find this just really helps
to prepare the lips for lipsticks helps
to create a more dramatic shape more
perfected shape so if your lipstick is a
bit more barmy which a lot of my
favorites are this just helps to define
the lip shape a lot better than if you
didn't use a lip liner I often get
questions about what lip liner I'm
wearing when I wear this it's quite just
quite a thick line as well so it's quite
a statement lip liner so people often
ask about it and they cannot believe it
and they're so overjoyed when I tell
them that it's Rimmel so this is one
that I will always continue to
repurchase speaking of repurchasing I
need to buy a few more of these because
I do not know what I will do it myself
if they ever become out of stock and I'm
pretty sure the Victoria Beckham for
Estee Lauder products are all
limited-edition this is the lip pencil
in a1 Victoria I think this is probably
the only lip liner in range but it is
the dreamiest brownie pink shade so long
lasting such a flattering color and I
probably wore this for 99% of the
occasions they went to this year any
time I wanted to create a really
beautiful makeup look a really almost
kind of dramatic lip look this is one
that I would go for I wear this a lot
with my Tom Ford lipstick also with
basically all the lipsticks I spoke
about I will pair this with it if I want
a really long lasting beautiful lip
liner look
moving on to bases on consciousness
videos being super long so I'm going to
be quite speedy with these all of my
bases have something in common in that
they are quite good for the skin so they
don't really clog the skin they don't
leave it worse off and it was if you
didn't wear the base if that makes sense
first of all and the most lightweight of
my favourite bases of 2017 is the bite
area cellular Rose CC cream this is
that I use on days when I was having a
no makeup day I will this lock to the
gym as well I felt like it was
lightweight enough to let my skin
breathe during a workout and also
because it's so moisturizing I used it
after workouts too often in place of a
moisturizer if I wanted to just be
really really quick and have a glowing
fresh complexion this is what I would
reach for along similar lines but maybe
a little bit more courage a little bit
more of a perfected base is the la mer
soft fluid long wear foundation this
really is incredible skincare in a
foundational product it has so many of
the amazing hydrating benefits that you
get from at the alumnae skin care
products which is amazing but it's a
fairly good coverage so if you having a
slightly more bad skin day or you just
really want your base to be perfected
but not too heavy this is the one that I
would go for and also the la Mer
packaging I absolutely love I hadn't
tried anything from la Mer before 2017
so I really did fall in love with the
brand
last year the higher coverage foundation
that I wore all throughout 2017 or ever
since it launched which i think was in
the middle of the year no surprises is
the bare minerals bare Pro foundation
I've raved about this loads so very high
level basically it's just super good for
your skin it has loads of skin that
loving benefits to it it's also SPF 20
it's very hydrating it's long lasting
and it actually makes your skin better
over time as you use it as opposed to
Sony foundations which make your skin
worse when you wear it this as well
lasts so long on the skin if I spend a
day in London if I'm doing a day of
photo shoots and meetings and I'm just
super busy
normally my face would get sweaty and I
would just want to take my makeup off
and cleanse but this my skin it looked
great and felt comfortable even after a
full day of wear I recommended this just
so many of my friends and family and you
guys a lot of people have told me that
they are also obsessed with it says and
not just me if you haven't tried this
yet to definitely make that another of
your news resolutions to give this a go
there's loads of shade Rangers as well I
do also talk about this a little bit
more in my cold weather beauty
essentials video so if you haven't
watched that yet I'll leave it linked on
the screen and down below definitely
check that one out next and yeah I've
talked a lot more about what I love this
that one also in the base category my
favorite concealer of the year is the
concealer is that what it's called I
think it's literally called the
concealer yeah from la Mer this one is
slightly lighter than my skin tone so I
often use this underneath my eyes to
really light in that area it's very
hydrating so I didn't feel like it kind
of sunk into any fine lines around that
area and again it has ingredients in
there which are skin that loving very
soothing so it's great for on blemishes
too also again in the packaging it's so
gorgeous it's in this kind of light pink
pearly silver tube and I think it is so
beautiful
and my final 2017 in the kind of base
category is the provide city smart from
Elizabeth Arden 2017 was a year that I
really became OCD obsessed with how bad
the pollution outside in London is for
your skin pollution particles are way
smaller than our pores so they get into
our skin very easily which is of course
really bad for so many reasons mostly
for aging of the skin this helps your
skin to protect itself from pollution is
SPF 50 as well it has lots of
antioxidants in there as well which help
the skin to create its own barrier
against nasties alike pollution so I
would apply this as my final skin care
step before putting on my makeup each
day and especially if I was going into
the city and into London for a day quick
break from makeup products to talk about
perfumes obviously Viktor &amp;amp; Rolf
Flowerbomb it's the perfume with I've
worn as my kind of signature fragrance
for so many years it really is my my
signature perfumes I had to briefly
mention that so this year some new
perfumes I also fell in love with the La
Perla fragrance it's really took me by
surprise
I wasn't expecting don't know why I just
wasn't expecting to love this as much as
I did but it's so feminine so classic
such a luxurious smelling fragrance and
very very fresh I would definitely wear
there's a lot more next spring time if
you love Flowerbomb then at chances I
love this one as well in fact you'll
probably love all of these because they
all kind of have those very warm
comforting feminine vibes about them so
another one that I loved for that reason
is the girl and manga line fragrance
this one is really cute it's
personalized it says juicy on it which
is even more adorable than it already is
this one will always remind me of our
trip to Provence because I wore it every
day while
out there and this is also Charlie's
favorite fragrance on me he loves how
this smells I tend to wear this in the
evenings a bit more I'd saved the other
two up slightly more daytime fragrances
whereas this one is a bit smarter a
little bit more luxe for evening wear
and then kind of a mixture between day
wear and evening wear
I really have loved the Giorgio Armani's
sea fragrance this year I actually had
this I think I had this in 2016 as well
but I'm just fell in love with it this
year more for some reason I've been
wearing this a lot when I haven't been
sure what fragrance I wanted to wear
it's a very easy to love fragrance very
easy to wear it's very likeable as well
loads of different friends of mine
compliment me when I wear this this one
I'd say is probably a little bit more
fresh than the previous three again
super feminine super classic but a
little bit more zingy and citrusy than
the other three next a couple of my
favourite bronzers from 2017 in my last
two years and your favourites I've
spoken about the hourglass bronzer I
still love that one but this year I
pushed the boat out and try to cover new
ones and have absolutely fallen in love
with this one especially from
bareMinerals it is they're invisible
bronze bronzer as you might be able to
guess from the name it's really natural
looking if you just want a bit of color
to your skin
a real sunkissed glow then this is
absolutely perfect it's not shimmery
especially non shimmery as the hourglass
one but it still gives the skin a really
beautiful healthy glow and then I have
to give a shout out to the Max Factor
creme bronzer I've got the shade oh five
light gold four hands down the best
drugstore bronzer I have ever tried this
I would say it's very soon as the
hourglass bronzer it even has the same
kind of marbleized effect as the
hourglass bronzer it looks so beautiful
in once again gives a really lovely
healthy glow and I would highly highly
recommend trying this one out if you
haven't already or if you're a fan of
hourglass and maybe you don't you're not
quite ready to invest in you and yet so
then give this a go favourite highlight
of the year is this one from a Tom Ford
it is there Soleil bloom highlights now
I didn't I almost didn't include a
because I'm not really a high light
person I don't really consider myself a
pro at using high light but when I do
want to add a little bit of shames of
cheekbones this is always the one that I
reach for I am wearing it today in quite
a subtle manner I just applied a tiny
bit and it's just such an easy to wear
highlight if you're not sure if you suit
highlight you just want something quite
natural to give the skin a beautiful
radiance then this one is gorgeous I
would say the consistency is perfect I
don't find it drying on my skin even if
I putting it over the top of a powder
and bronzer it still looks beautiful
it's like a pinky crush the pearl effect
almost like a rose gold as you can tell
from the beautiful rose gold packaging
which is another reason I love it it's
just in such a gorgeous compact but so
many of the highlights that I've tried
this year were just too dry they just
almost separated on the skin whereas
this gives a very very natural beautiful
glow
speaking of powder I absolutely loved
using the Lumiere powder towards the end
of this year it's called the sheer
pressed powder in translucent Oh - this
one you really can't tell that you're
wearing a powder it's very very
natural-looking if you hate powders and
you don't want to look cakey or dried
anyway then this is the one for you I
like to apply this with a fan brush this
is my zoeva rose golden luxe fan brush
and I find it picks up the perfect
amount
I usually just dust this on any areas
where my makeup tends to slip so my chin
my nose and this kind of area between
the eyebrows that's where I usually
apply this just for a bit of
modification a bit of makeup setting but
without looking super powdery this
powder and highlight compact a
combination of the two tends to live in
my handbag and it is from bare minerals
it is officially called the translucent
powder duo this is a mattifying powder
but again not cakey not totally matte
still somehow let's have skin look glowy
even when you've got a powder on it's
pure magic to know how they do it and
this is a very very subtle highlight
this as I said lives in my handbag so if
I just want to add a bit of radiance or
a bit of modification to my complexion
I'll reach for this it's got a mirror in
the lid to it so very very handy and
very well used and one that I will
continue to repurchase as
this one runs out I have three favorites
in the eyebrow category this year I
couldn't not mention the benefit gimme
brow this is a product that I keep on
coming back - I've tried loads of
different eyebrow products this one to
me I think is the best value for money
I've tried super luxe eyebrow products
from Tom Ford YSL armani
but i still keep coming back to this one
the shape of the brush is so perfect
it sets the brows it gives them enough
color and it also has that kind of fiber
filament to volumize them as well so
highly recommend and love gimme brow it
uses pretty much the whole year then
when it comes to brow pencils and skinny
brow pencils on my favorite product to
shape and color the brows I love the
Anastasia brow is not gonna ramble about
that because you guys know how fabulous
it is but also this year I absolutely
loved using the brow defying my shade is
medium in the range that Fleur de force
did with I this is a double ended so you
get I feel like you're getting two for
the price of one it has a slightly
lighter and a slightly darker shades you
can really create a beautiful 3d tonal
effect on your eyebrows and once again
like the Anastasia brow is their very
very fine pencils so you can really
create hair like strokes in the browser
which is the effect that I love and find
that I reach for on an everyday basis
I'm not really an eyeliner person but
there are two that I used more than any
others throughout 2017 when I did want a
deep black liquid line the liner that I
would reach for is the bareMinerals lash
domination ink liner it is a felt tip
effect pen which I find the easiest to
use beautiful intense color really easy
to get close to the lash lines you can
create quite a thin softer looking line
but also just adds definition and
boldness
to your lashes so that was my favorite
liquid liner didn't use it that much but
if I was going out or just wanted a
really bold look that's what I would go
for but an even more natural look is the
Marc Jacobs highlighter matte gel eye
crayon in the shade brownie I'm wearing
this today I tend to really only wear
this when I'm filming because I just
want a little bit more definition to my
lash line I have got naturally quite
light lashes I find that this makes
quite a lot of difference when it comes
to making my lash
a little bit more bold this one that you
can roll it up so you don't need to
worry about sharpening it and it's a
very soft formula so really easy to
smudge into that lash line okay bear
with me we're down to the final three
products when it comes to eyeshadow
palettes I have two favorites The Naked
heat was probably my most used I shadow
palette throughout the whole of 2017 all
of the different warm Browns in here
were just the perfect shade to me I'm
saying everything in the past tense they
are the perfect shade to me I would say
that sourced and chaser as you might be
able to tell are my most used and
consuming I've worn these new every
single day this year I've not hit pan
yet I think that's just incredible which
i think makes this really good value for
money I'm getting so many shades such
beautiful fine soft colors easy to blend
this is all you need for a brown smokey
eye or a natural everyday look highly
highly recommend the naked heat palette
especially if you love quite a neutral I
look like myself but then I also treated
myself to the Tarte buried treasure I
shadow palette when I went to Sephora
last time I was in America and I
absolutely love this it's a little bit
more fun it's a lot more travel friendly
so when I was traveling in my portable
makeup bag this is one I would take with
me again super boring but the matte
shades are the ones that I use the most
in here this one up at the top this
actually it's got a little bit of
shimmer in it I can now see that the Sun
is beaming through the window but this
is a purple shade I'd use this on the
crease for a little bit more definition
and once again really big mirror in the
lid so another reason why it was so
great for traveling I thought this is
the last product I've just seen I have
two more mascaras on my lap to talk
about but the hourglass ambient lighting
edit valium 3 has been my most used
complexion palette of the year I notice
I didn't have a blush in this favourites
because I don't really use blush that
often but when I do it has been this one
from the palette it's also got the
hourglass powders which I love the
hourglass bronzers that I love and it's
simply stunning so no surprises that
this is my favorite complexion palette
of 2017 and last but not least my to
mascara favorites this one is the Dior
show pump and Volume Mascara now if I
want really big bold lashes really false
lash effect chunky lashes that are still
beautifully separated then this is the
one that I will go for it's got a
squiggly section down here so you can
really kind of massage the mascara onto
your brush I don't use it that much but
if that's what they've got to do to make
their mascara stand out then fine but
it's just a really great one if you want
big bold dramatic lashes and I've really
enjoyed discovering do your makeup
towards the end of 2017 if we're going
to try a lot more in 2018 everything
I've tried so far I really really love
and finally sorry if you can hear puppy
noises in the background they're
currently fighting down by my feet at
the moment that obviously getting bored
they want me to take them outside
finally another mascara that I really
have loved throughout 2017 is the
Elizabeth Arden grand entrance mascara
I've spoken about this before might even
have been in my 2016 favorites but this
one I'd say is my everyday go to mascara
for beautifully separated lashes a bit
of volume but not too OTT kind of
dramatic but again not too over-the-top
if you like to have a beautiful lash
look that's not oh my god you're wearing
so much mascara then this is the one for
that I love the brush it's very stiff
bristled so great for separating the
lashes but a huge huge fan of this and
one will continue to repurchase and that
is it this feels like the world's
longest video thank you so much if you
