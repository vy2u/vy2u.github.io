2016 favorites this time you'd come back
for the fashion favorites so a few days
ago on my channel I published my 2016
beauty favorites including makeup
skincare and hair care so if you want to
find out what my favorites were nerd
categories then I'll leave that video
linked down below but today we are going
to talk about my favorites fashion
favorites of 2016 throughout the whole
entire year and that's clothes and
accessories so I actually found this
video a lot harder to pull together
because well three on and those of my
clothes are actually in the lot so I
don't have a storage space in my little
London house for all of my clothes so I
do put a lot of my clothes in storage so
I hope you'll forgive me is on a few
occasions I don't have the clothes to
hold up but instead I'm going to show
you a photo of me wearing them so I'm
actually going to kick things off with a
rather high-end piece and having said
that don't worry there are a lot more
affordable things in this video too but
first of all I have to talk about my
Valentino roxtor shoes these were my
first designer shoe purchase I actually
have only made two or three designer
shoe posters in my entire life but not
for one second have I ever regret
purchasing these shoes they are so
plastic so comfortable and I wear them
so so so much these I actually bought my
graduation which was three years ago and
I wear them so much because they're just
such versatile shoes because of the nude
color it means that they work with so
many outfits really flattering leg
lengthening and because of all these
straps they really are incredibly
comfortable I probably need to bite the
bullet and treat myself to a new pair
this year in 2017 so they are getting a
little bit acid but considering how many
times I've worn them I think they are
faring pretty darn well everybody asks
me whether they're worth it these are
approaching seven hundred pounds so not
cheap in the slightest they are very
expensive shoes but actually if you do
want to treat yourself to one designer
pair of shoes and
you want to make sure you're going to
get a lot of use out of them then these
the ones that I would recommend you go
for I hammerheart think these are the
best value for money when it comes to
price per wear of any designer shoes
I've ever seen or tried so we're going
to start with Footwear because that is
what I'm grabbing at the moment I also
wore these sandals with little pom-poms
on from Bowden so much this year these
were the kind of a whimsical perches I
bought them off the cuffs a little bit
of an impulse buy and I ended up wearing
them so much I took them on every single
summer holidays starting from the trips
I went on in May I wore them bike riding
I wore them even on like long walks or
one on the beach they got so much used
as you can see they are fairly battered
but they haven't fallen apart or broken
or anything like that and I'm pretty
sure I'll continue to wear them next
summer as well or this summer and yeah a
really good price I think I pay around
fifty pounds for these and I've worn
them so so so much I think for my most
one sandals of the summer so I thought I
increase those as well
when we got into autumn we all became
obsessed with mules and these ones were
by far my favorite find of the autumn
mule period seasons are from River
Island
they are kind of Gucci juice but Zara
also had some really good future dupes
with the faux fur inside which i also
bought and love but these ones were my
first mule purchase and I will be so
much in the autumn months I hope that
mules continue to be in fashion 2017 so
let's get more wear out of these these
also attracted the most comments on my
Instagram those questions and most
compliments so yeah a real real real
favorite of the year and a final
Footwear favorite more of a winter shoe
and no surprise on my mango boots I will
these are so many outfits you really
can't go wrong with a pair of black
boots so practical these I think or 18
$9.99 I believe and once again price
fell well with these was absolutely
incredible I want so much this disc it
really gave them a bit of a designer
edge I think is Victoria Beckham and
Nicolas Kirkwood
me that did this similar detail with
their shoes so many people just could
not believe me when I told them that
they were from mango by a thousand
hundred hundred pounds because they read
you look as though the price point is
much much higher
I still wear these a lot they have been
worn to death but they're still fairing
pretty well doesn't know the only place
you can really tell their warnings on
the sole which I'm going to show you too
much and is looking pretty gross I
probably should get them resoled but on
the actual foot or outer area there's no
scratches on the leather this is looking
a little tarnished but it's not really
noticeable and the heel is still looking
good too
so really trusted these I would say
these were Footwear a best buy of 2016
so this year when it came to handbags I
opted for quality over quantity so I
searched a few designer handbag of
course all of them are my favorite
because I just love them all - absolute
pieces so I decided to whittle it down
to just two in this video the first one
is my Valentino roxtor bag Valentino's
vandalizes absolutely adore when it
comes to accessories but it's very
pricey so this is actually my first
Valentino handbag I did I should buy
another one from far fetch late in the
year and but this one remains a real
real favorite because only because of
the memories I think I mentioned when I
unboxed it that for me handbags are as
much about the memories that they bring
in the actual product itself so this
just reminds me of I think it's made in
time and I just felt that everything was
going really well I've been working
really hard and he was starting to show
and I treated myself to this and it'll
always remind me of that of working hard
and reaping the rewards from it such a
beautiful color is a little bit more
unusual than most Valentino rocks this
bag rocks good bags which tend to be
like a chain partial color it's really
enough for all my essentials and it's
really the standout piece it works so
beautifully with all my spring/summer
outfits which tend to be white both
helping because of all these different
neutral colors in there and the bright
coral oranges it's really standout
statement piece but still being very
very wearable and no surprises my second
favorite handbag the one that I wore far
too much throughout all within winter
and I'm still using all the time is my
Gucci dialysis bag this again was
real treats in myself and another one
that I worked really really hard for and
then decided to treat myself to I asked
you to love it I will leave the unboxing
video down below if you'd like to see
more details but this one I just feel is
so right for me I have no regrets when
it comes to this design it's a classic
bag but the strong detail gives it a
little bit of a twist and makes it a bit
more feminine so perfect my style
size-wise it works really well it goes
with all of my winter outfits really
elevates the look and yeah I just
absolutely love it love it love it love
it 30 do feet now they're going to move
on to clothes and the first of which is
a really dorky one but you won't be
surprised to hear it is mine Marks &amp;amp;
Spencer thermals so in the cooler months
I wear them under every single outfit
you guys have heard me joking about
these so often they're so lightweight
and thin and yet they keep you so warm I
have white I have neon I have black I
have sparkly and gray I have brown I
have every single color Under the Sun
and yeah I pretty much wear them under
everything they keep me so warm and
comfy and they're cheap from ups and
fences so highly recommend and their
service if you haven't tried them yet
feel like I should be an M&amp;amp;M thermal
ambassador the amount that I thought
about them
speaking of thermals my next fashion
favorite is this pair of jeans these are
from Hollister and they are also thermal
jeans so if you look inside they
actually have a brushed fabric and you
might have heard me talking about these
in recent vlog and wondered why as I was
talking about staying warm in thermal
jeans well now I know
so Hollister as a whole became a real go
through from me this year when it came
to jeans I love the fit I love the price
points and yeah I just feel like they
have something for every gene desire
that you could have so hot of the Jews
as a whole but these ones in particular
because they are thermal they kept me so
warm even when we're in Gothenburg and
it was absolutely freezing that but
noticeably compared to another pair of
jeans which one thermal they were just
so cozy and so warm so I'd include those
and when a lot these are pretty much my
go-to jeans at the moment so from
thermal jeans to summer holidays my next
favorite is my Maria
Keeney this one with the matching black
bottoms with the scalloped edge were
once again a bit of splurge for me this
year I think it's quite telling that a
lot of these pieces are my investment
pieces as I said to me this year is
about quality over quantity and the
pieces that I act in love so so so much
are those that I've met a little bit
more in but I feel like I chose well
because I got a lot for use of them and
this is one of those pieces it was a
very expensive bikini some in costumes
but I feel so comfortable wearing this
because of the high-waisted bottoms it
covers that pass the rise to me that I
don't want to be seen and makes my legs
look longer at the top is really
flattering considering I am NOT very
boobie I have really small boobs so this
just makes me feel really comfortable
it's not cleavage in slices instead it's
a little bit more chic and trendy which
is what I prefer to be on the beach
definitely not a sexy Bistro and more of
am a chic beach goer I like to think so
because this bikini made me feel so
comfortable and made me feel really
fashionable and great on the beach it
was worth every single penny to me so
this summer not only will I be wearing
this one again it's a death but I'll be
thinking a lot more carefully along the
line so do I want to spend maybe the
same amount of money on numerous Topshop
river island etc keys or do I want just
that one that makes me feel really
really good and I think I'll probably be
leaning towards the latter decision
giving given how great I felt wearing
this one at this front and we're back to
Windsor again my next favorite is this
Club Monaco jumper with the fabulous
ruffle details please it is I actually
picked up from the Sloane Street Sloane
Square store I saw it on the mannequin
in the window and so it was so fabulous
I love knitwear I think the knitwear
once again is one of those categories
that you really do get what you pay for
and Club Monaco from you is always a
favorite when it comes to knit West this
one I wore so much I got so much use out
of it it was so warm and cozy found a
little bit of hard to wear with sleeves
because you can't believe it but when it
started to be a little bit more mild
like it is now I mean it's January and
it smiles I've been wearing this
underneath my she lays and
just really really fabulous I get
compliments whenever I wear it I did
look for a few cheaper alternatives
which I do really really like but I
still keep reaching them back for this
one and it really has become an absolute
staple in my winter wardrobe a pair of
trousers that I wore throughout the
entire year spring summer autumn and
winter is this pair from Topshop they
are wide legged palazzo palazzo trousers
and they are high waisted so I find that
really flattering I actually wear them
with my Valentino heels or my jean
beatty rossi ones which actually I did a
blog post on how I was going to wear
these on Christmas Day so I'll leave
that links down below if you'd like more
photos but these I feel just are so
practical we have so many uses they look
great with a cashmere it's like a
cashmere desktop that's in the blog post
they look great with something like this
this is my self-portrait top and they
would look really great with this kind
of stuff as well for an evening occasion
you can pat him down with something a
little bit more casual maybe like in
this is ribbed top I just wore these so
much with so many different combinations
I never drunk when I pick these up and
actually I picked them up in my very
first come shopping with me video which
is my come shopping with me a lot to the
street long before anyone else is doing
come shopping with me videos by the way
yeah I bought those in that video so you
can check it out if you want to really
impressed with how many ways I've been
able to wear these this year and then
last but not least I had to include a
coat and this was a really tough
decision because I really loved a lot of
kosis year but the one that made me feel
the most fabulous is most unusual and
just I just felt so great when our
awards is my Cape coat from coast and I
certify those here's me wearing it
because I understand that me holding it
up like this is not showing it off to
its best abilities but this really
surprised me from coast
I think of coasts as a retailer for
really fabulous dresses bridesmaid
dresses prom dresses that kind of thing
I love them but I was not expecting to
find the coat of my dreams that so this
in a cape more than a coat as you can
see it has that doesn't have arms
squeeze that has armholes subscribe it
and lipstick um it may also have a tie
waist so really flattering because it's
all managers have sent you in but then
you do have this extra material that
keeps you so lovely and warm - it's the
wool blend so really fabulous quality
keeps you so warm and it just honestly
it looks so fabulous I would say the one
downside is it's quite hard to wear your
handbag with it with the Gucci dialysis
bag I tended to double up the strap and
hold it on my crook of my elbow and set
it over the shoulder that's the one
thing I did find a little challenging
but overall just such a fabulous coat
and form that I can't wait to wear even
more this year so the pieces that I
don't have with me that are up in the
loft include a self portrait dress and
this one I actually picked up towards
the end of the year but as soon as I
wore it I actually wore it involved a
dog and I just felt so fabulous it's one
of those dresses that it's a staple in
your wardrobe it's a real classic piece
and I'm definitely going to wear it so
much more in 2017 I'm going to take me
on any lovely warm holidays perhaps if
Charlie 9 managed to get back to
Maldives which brings us coffee will do
at some point this year it's the most
perfect dress for a luxurious holiday
like that but also any fabulous events
in the summer here in the UK like any
polo game going to Ascot perhaps it's
going to be so perfect that I absolutely
love it so that is another favorite of
2016 and I also would say my Boden's
leopard print sandals these were another
pair of shoes that I bought on the whim
and ended up wearing so much especially
when we went to Greece we did out all
our cruise of the Greek islands and also
our Croatian Boat shirt I wore these
shoes so so so much so I thought I would
include those in which he doesn't 17
favorites as well so those are my
favorites fashion pieces of 2017 my most
worn pieces and the pieces that I just
feel this sounds a little bit strange
but the most personal connection to and
the people that I loved wearing the most
