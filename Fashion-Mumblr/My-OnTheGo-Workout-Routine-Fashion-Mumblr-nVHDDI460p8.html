something a little bit different from me
I am here in the six senses now move in
love these and I found that we have the
most incredible space above the gym so I
thought I would share with you a quick
workout which you can do anywhere in the
world so this can be at home because it
doesn't involve any equipment I'm just
using a yoga mat because as a wooden
floor it could be a little bit hard but
you can do this at home you can do this
in any hotel room on a beach Mountain
anywhere you are so I hope you enjoy
this workout obviously I'm not a fitness
professional and not trained in any way
this is just simply what I like to do
workouts wherever I am in the world so
enjoy
alright so first of all I'm going to be
choosing my workout playlist I have one
and microphone on to modify so get that
plane to get me a musical workout first
thing I'm doing is stretching it is so
important and it especially if you've
been traveling I am incredibly tight on
the long journey so I'm doing about five
minutes worth of stretches before the
workout
now it's time to do the workout so
before I do my circuit I like to make
sure my heartbeat is up this looks easy
and let's be honest it is but it starts
to warm up the body ahead of your
workout so slight side star stretches
for about a minute to kick things off
then I call these my Superman
stretches I crawl down and get into a
cobra position and then lift the legs
this helps to stretch and warm up the
back as well
you can add in some arms to increase the
stretch and this is where you really do
look like Superman again I do this for
about a minute
you
now the Running Room spot I need to
really blitz that heart rate and a
couple of final easy exercises before
the more intense pieces normal lunges
provide a minute and then some high
paced burpees
you
okay it's time to kick things up a notch
I do star jump for a minute when your
body's already warmed up these are great
for improving your cardiovascular
endurance
then I'm doing some squat jumps I love
doing news on holiday as it really works
for glutes giving you that great beach
booty and tones up your thighs as well
as well as the glutes they tone up the
cars hamstrings your core and your quads
make sure to support as low as you can
each time and really go for it when you
jump
speaking of sighs lunch jumps are a real
burner they help you to get that
definition on your quad and I like to do
these for one minute by the way did I
mention that I do this whole circuit
about three or four times over by now
you'll be feeling it in your quads
hamstrings and calves and this one also
helps with your ankle stability so
you're less likely to topple over in
your high heels
next is side planks to help those
absolute epic in a bikini I do one
minute on each side keeping my hips
straight this will help you maintain a
great posture and it also works your
back your shoulders your abs and ringer
this one reminded me of doing the slalom
when skiing I don't know the official
name of this exercise but it's a great
workout your quads of cars and it also
engages the core as well once again do
this for about a minute with each
surface
next is onto the wall set I hold for
about a minute
keep your size of a 90-degree angle for
the floor you will feel the burn this
one helps with endurance in your group
and your car and your fiber course as
well
you
okay now it's time to have this big
global water and about a minute draught
and then it's time to do it all over
again I'm free
when that's all over where you'll be
craving a stretch make sure not to skip
this step out why would you it's my
favorite part of the workout this helps
to stop the lactic acid building up in
your muscles which can lead to soreness
and fatigue and it helps keep the blood
circulating around your body to enjoy
those stretches because you end it
and that's it time to enjoy a scrummy
breakfast and a day in the sunshine I
really hope you guys enjoyed my first
workout video let me know what you
thought in the comments below thanks
watching and a few minutes
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
