for joining me for today's video
which I believe is my first collection
video so actually okay so actually last
vlogmas from last october I briefly
showed you that we're gonna vlog a shoe
collection I think and maybe even a
makeup collection well of a long time
ago and they were quite vloggy so I
thought I would do a proper collection
video today I thought I would just smash
out three in one for today's video
because I wanted to start with some of
my accessories
so today I'm going to share with you my
designer sunglasses collection my
jewelry collection or like the
highlights of my jewelry collection and
also my watch collection and that sounds
like quite a lot but actually I tend to
wear the same pieces over and over again
in certain areas I like to invest in
certain areas I like to save so you will
really kind of see that throughout this
video you probably already know from my
sunglasses and my jewelry I just say
that as I'm touching this piece that I
do where I do have some real favorite
pieces some key pieces that I wear open
over again sorry about the life-changing
I swear there's like black clouds out
there and and blue sky and this once is
going in and out and so yeah today I'm
going to start with my sunglass
collection and the glasses I'm going to
show you are all from a website called
smart buy glasses and you might
recognize that name if you follow me on
Instagram or read my blog because I'm
forever tagging them as the place where
I have got my glasses from they have
over 180 different designers of glasses
on the website selling sunglasses
optical glasses they even sell contact
lenses they have guides for what kind of
glasses suit your face shape shopping
guides they even have like a virtual
Tryon guide so it's really one-stop shop
for an online destination for picking up
sunglasses and
mentioned all the glasses I'm going to
show you today in this video are from
there and most excitingly I've also
paired up with them to offer you guys a
little giveaway and it's super duper
easy to enter all you have to do is
paste the URL of your favorite pair of
glasses from smart buy glasses in the
comments section below let me know why
they will favor it and also make sure
you are subscribed to the smart buy
glasses YouTube channel so really easy
I'll leave a link down below and you
could win your favorite pair of glasses
from the website and when we're talking
about brands such as Selene Tom Ford
Fendi Dolce Gabanna you know that's a
good giveaway so I'm really excited to
be able to share that with you guys so
without further ado let me show you my
favorite sunglasses the first pair you
probably recognize because I have been
wearing these a lot recently and these
are from Fendi so they are this
beautiful anybody's that kind of know
sunglass designer styles will recognize
these immediately because what makes
Fendi glass is so recognizable is
firstly there's almost lightning bolt
zigzag down the side there and this
season they're really focusing on this
pointy outer edge which gives them a bit
of a cat eye look which personally I
think really suits my face shape I feel
like I'm allowed to say that without
being too like modest you know I do
think that this is the shape that suits
my face the best so I love that they
have this detail here but also because
it's gold it kind of blends into my hair
so it's not too obvious it's a beautiful
design detail without being too
in-your-face
so absolutely love them they do have
these little toggles which get caught in
my hair sometimes which is a bit of a
Pink's I do like to have them on top of
my head in a lot of outfit show in a lot
of outfit shots or vlogs you're probably
used to seeing them up there and then
they have this deep tour to a shell
design over the bridges which kind of
look like dramatic eyebrows and yes
absolutely love these these are from
Fendi and they have a beautiful little
pouch which annoyingly is in my handbag
upstairs and but of course all the
design
else's come with beautiful pouches lens
wise they have a dark blue going through
to a very very light blue gradient which
is really handy because if it's sunny up
there not obviously um your eyes are
protected then if you look down if
you're reading a menu or something it's
not quite so dark so very well thought
out beautiful design I'm kind of airing
towards these being my favorite
sunglasses of the moment next I have a
pair from Selene and before I go into
sunglasses Celina pouches are really
good and not hard pouches which means
they're really great for having in your
handbag they store flat don't take up
too much space not too heavy but they're
very protective it's very thick material
so thought I'd just mention that as well
but these are the sunglasses once again
tour choice shell you guys may recognize
a theme I love tortoiseshell I find that
it's a really lovely pattern that
doesn't tend to go out of start as one
of these flowers you keep seeing coming
back season after season so these are
classic saline design they're actually a
little bit big for my face shape but you
can bend them in slightly and these
three dots on the corner are what to
make some recognizable as Selene glasses
and they've also got the Wayfarer design
which is as she came into fashion I'd
say maybe about five years ago following
probably a Leonardo DiCaprio film but
they haven't really gone out of fashion
that's so classic and stylish I don't
see them that style going out anytime
soon so a really good investment piece
they've got again this toroid shell
design running through the arms of the
glasses and then an aviator style gold
bridge as well I think these are a
little bit more sporty than the Fendi
equally stylish very kind of street
style Instagrammer
type of vibe very very classic and easy
to wear they have less design detail
than the Fendi ones but are equally as
fashionable in my opinion so another
really really beautiful pair and Selene
of course a very very high-end brand so
it's great to get them a little bit
cheaper than the high street price on
smart buy glasses so let me know if
these buy your favorite my next
favourites are from Dolce and Gabbana
and I like to keep these extra extra
secure so I keep them in not only the
hard case but also the soft case as well
because these are probably just the
I want to keep really really precious
they're like my special occasion
sunglasses and they look a little
something like this
so of course they are a beautiful pink
color try them once you can see I'm not
sure how I feel about having my eyebrows
so clear across the top maybe it's
because they're a lighter plastic that
you can see the eyebrows a little bit
more clearly but I just think that's so
stunning they are this pink almost
see-through II resin I don't want to
call it plastic I think it's potentially
resin and then it almost looks as though
there are rose petals kind of floating
around in the resin although it's not
rose petals I think it's a darker darker
plastic maybe a plaster or something but
either way they're absolutely it's
stunning
the lenses are a coppery bronzy
cinematic rose gold and I just think
they look so gorgeous
but without being full-on mirror finish
because I find with mirror finish
sunglasses when you have a conversation
with people they just can't stop looking
at themselves and it throws them off
which sometimes can be great if you want
to like being controlling the
conversation that's great but personally
I don't like the person I'm talking to
to feel uncomfortable so just love this
lens that was bit of a tangent and once
again they are the classic shape nothing
too crazy out there so very very
wearable and once again with this gold
bar going across the top which is
definitely a trend that we are seeing in
sunglasses this autumn so these are just
beautiful perfect if you do have a
smaller face like myself because they're
not too empowering they're not too big
and clunky they're very delicate very
feminine and very subtle branding
personally I don't like to splash
massive like CC schnell logos everywhere
I find a little bit you know not my kind
of vibe whereas these just very subtly
say dolce gabbana nice and small on the
arm of the sunglasses which is just
stunning so yeah really love these and I
keep them super super safe you can see
no scratches Oh an absolute perfect
condition keeping my pouch in their case
and hopefully they will last me forever
and finally for my favorite designer
sunglasses I have chosen another pet
from Selene Selene I think was actually
the first brand that I went to for
designer song
it so definitely holds oh I've chosen
the same pair again hold on a moment
there we go
same case looks identical but different
parent side CS lien will always hold a
special place in my heart and as you saw
from the last pair I'm not all about
those bold colors I also like the
lighter shades but these are big and
bold in that they are massive without a
doubt these on my biggest sunglasses
sometimes if I'm having a bad makeup day
or I just don't want to talk to anyone
I'll stick on my massive Celine's and
then that is my sign for don't talk to
me leave me alone like I'm in my zone so
that's these sunglasses really love the
color of these they're almost a blush
pink you notice how I automatically like
wipe the makeup off the nose bridge it
can't be helped
I just always get makeup on my
sunglasses let me know if I'm alone or
if you do that as well
but these are a beautiful minke pinky
brownie taupey color just a combination
of all of the above and they have brown
gradient lenses so really really
beautiful lenses and again really easy
to wear they go with most things in my
wardrobe and then not too they're not
too like far from skin color if that
makes sense then not like a fuchsia pink
or a bright cobalt blue there are
different color than the usual blacks
and browns but they're still very
neutral so it means they do go with a
lot of things
also when I've got them on my face you
can really see the beautiful gradient
and I find this is something that you
don't get cheaper sunglasses you don't
get this really lovely smooth gradient
and I think this makes them look really
beautiful and high-end so get a lot of
use out of these - probably saying
something despite what I said earlier
about them being my don't talk to me
sunglasses so they are my favorite
designer sunglasses all from smart buy
glasses Cote UK I hope you guys enjoyed
looking through those with me as I said

best of luck and don't forget to go and
enter and now I'm going to share with
you my watch collection so as
and Instagrammer I'm sure you can
imagine we get sent a lot of watches
because watch companies just love to
advertise on Instagram following the
whole Daniel Wellington but actually a
girl can only have a certain amount of
watch it so you'll notice that my watch
collection is fairly small so I do give
my friends a few of these Instagram
watches I given time um and given to my
brother's wife yeah my friends do
receive quite a lot of gifts from me so
I will start with what I'm wearing now
actually if you saw my ASOS whole
recently you will recognize this one I
only filmed that video very recently and
still loving it it has got this
beautiful baby pink strap and rose gold
face it doesn't have any branding on it
and take a guess where this is from
you're cheating if you watch the whole
video this is from new look and it was
cheap as chips probably my chiefest
watch and one of my favorites so it just
goes to show that certain things I'm not
all about flashing the cash I just
absolutely love I love pink I love rose
gold and this ticks all the boxes next I
have this beautiful one from Olivia
Burton and it has a sage green leather
strap which again is a really thin strap
very nice and feminine and delicate
especially if you have smaller wrists
like I do I don't like to have any thick
straps kind of bulking over the whole
wrist so this is really beautiful watch
face itself is slightly thicker than
most it's quite um stands far away from
the wrist but that's because it has this
beautiful bumblebee inside it which the
thick case kind of like in cases it so
really love this one I will this one's
my everyday watch before getting this
one it is normal yellow gold as opposed
to rose gold and I tend to choose my
watch based on my outfit so if I've got
rose gold in my I don't know my belt or
as the zip then I'll go for a rose gold
watch or if I'm yellow gold then I'll go
for yellow gold gold watch so that's why
I have a few different variations the
Olivia Burton watch that I wore before
that one was this one here and it's very
similar the strap is lighter and it has
the three dials within the main
if that makes sense I don't know watch
terminology but it has the three smaller
faces within it and it kind of looks a
little bit more nautical with all of
these different stops and dials and
things I don't know what they do as long
as it tells the time I'm happy but yeah
Olivia Burton watches are probably my
favorite and this is the second one in
this current collection but I have had
others previously which have now been
moved on to another home then I have one
of my Instagram watches this one is from
a brand called it Abbott to Lyon and
it's this what you call this mesh kind
of metal rose gold mesh detail and to be
honest I haven't actually figured out
how to adjust the size of this one or
close it properly so it's still lying
around in my bedroom waiting for me to
figure out how to do that at the moment
it's just really big and rattles around
my wrist but I do really like this metal
mesh I think it looks really lovely
particularly in winter and I liked the
abberline do it with a smaller watch
face so really delicate and feminine
design and so finally my jewelry
collection which isn't going to take as
long to go through as you might imagine
because if you read my blog you'll know
that I tend to choose pieces that I love
and then wear them a lot so there's
actually not too many pieces here I'm
actually just going to pick out the
highlights to save time so first of all
I'll take you through what's inside this
little box it is a Monica Vanetta
jewelry box it's what you get when you
buy something from the brand and inside
of the pieces that I've been wearing a
lot recently and they are in this box
because it's just very portable for
traveling so if I open it up inside
there's just a few pieces all in the
middle here first of all these two
bracelets and these are from a brand
called jewelry box you may recognize
them I feature them on my bill quite a
lot recently and they're just really
good for stacking and adding lots of
interest if you just want to have a
little cluster on the wrist they're
really beautiful for that and then I
have a selection of rings a lot of these
are from Monica vinegar these are my
stacking rings you'll know that I often
always have two or three stacking rings
from the brand on this
this is kind of become my signature and
actually these ones are starting to get
a little bit discolored so I might swap
for this trio now and then I have a
couple from Pandora which is just
slightly more occasion like I have this
beautiful feather one which I just
absolutely adore and then this one is
more of a weave design with gems and
rose gold plated all around also in this
one I have a bracelet from carat London
which has little pyramids on a little
domed pyramids and a really beautiful
clasp it's very delicate as you can see
from this close-up and I wear this a lot
on special occasions then I have a
bracelet from Monika vinegar and by the
way that is the correct pronunciation I
got someone from head office to confirm
it from me and this has a labradorite
stone in there so it's a beautiful
delicate rose gold chain with a
labradorite stone in the middle and I
actually have the matching pendant which
Charlie bought for me quite a while ago
which I wear on a simple rose gold chain
such a really lovely little collection
in there and then I store the rest of my
jewelry you roam around in this
collection of Muji drawers it does
actually open at the top here so I can
get into my rings and earrings really
easily and there's also the drawers that
pull out so I'll start by telling you
about this one it's in my hand because
actually this is on my bedside table I
just grabbed it and this matches the
feather ring which I showed you a second
ago
from Pandora I wore it all summer you
probably recognize it from my photos and
videos and it's just the most beautiful
elegant ladylike piece attract so many
comments and compliments because it's
just so feminine I love the rose gold
love the feather and it's one of these
pieces that I think I'll continue to
wear for many seasons to come in the top
section here I've got a lot of rings lot
of Monica vinegar rings you can see that
they are all kind of rose gold with
either pink clear or just off clear
colored stones so I really love that
those particular colors are finding very
delicate and feminine I've got some baby
pink ones which I like to cluster up
this one here used to be my everyday
ring you can see it's got a little
discolored now and this one's incredibly
discolored you need to get some cleaner
on that one and then there's a few more
in here from brands like Pandora this
beautiful floral design this one I'm not
too sure where that one came from
actually and then there's a silver ring
I actually don't wear a few of these now
so maybe I need to have a little clear
out and then this slightly Messier side
holds my bigger rings such as this one
which is also from Pandora quite an old
style ring and then this beautiful one
also from carat London I wore this a lot
last Fashion Week these beautiful big
earrings also from carat London they're
just so effective having this little
cluster of diamonds although I'm pretty
sure they're not real diamonds on the
one side and then the big gold oval on
the other they look really beautiful
very feminine of course I have some faux
pearls massive faux pearls I think every
girl needs to have some pearl earrings
and then I have some more pieces from
Monika vinegar some labradorite stones I
have this massive ring which I wore
every day for like two years of my life
and yeah just a few other bits and bobs
in there the second drawer down is by oh
I didn't tidy this out for this video as
you can see contains my Fitbit which is
not terribly exciting a really old
necklace from whistles this ginormous
one looks really good with knit works
it's so big and chunky we've also got
these classic Monika Bennett of
friendship bracelets which I absolutely
love and then they're more unusual
designs with the big stones in the
middle more from jewelry box this one is
just from accessorize a really lovely
one for summer layering there's a ring
floating around in here more from wanna
convince er lots and lots of beautiful
pieces and then also this necklace from
current London as well really lovely
delicate necklace so to be honest you
probably recognize a lot of those pieces
