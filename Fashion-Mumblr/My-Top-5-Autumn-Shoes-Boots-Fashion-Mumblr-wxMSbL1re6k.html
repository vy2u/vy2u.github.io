for joining me for today's video which
is going to be an autumnal fashion video
to break up all the travel content you
guys been seeing on my channel lately so
today I wanted to share with you my top
5 most worn autumn shoes and these are
as you can guess by the title of the 5
pairs of shoes / boots that I've been
getting the most use out of now that the
temperature has really dropped here in
the UK and they're definitely a mixture
between fashionable and also really
functional and practical as well I can't
bear to be tottering around in stiletto
heels or getting wet and you know really
gross and uncomfortable during the
autumn months so these shoes are all
pretty practical and for that reason I
have been getting so much use out of
them over these past few rainy and cold
weeks so without further ado I'm gonna
get started with number 5 I'm gonna work
my way up to my most one and that's
these mules from Zara and these as you
guys I'm sure can tell are definitely
inspired by the Gucci mules the Gucci
ones are over 500 pounds these ones were
less than 1/10 of that price but they
still have the same style with fur
lining and then the plain black a toe
cap off the meal and I wore these
especially towards the beginning of
autumn I know it's a little bit more
mild all these so so so much they just
really elevated a pair of jeans even if
it was much warmer you could wear like a
long dress and maybe even collapse but I
mostly wore these with jeans and with
the hems ripped so I'm using the past
tense because now I feel like it's
getting a tiny bit cold for mules but
when I am just nipping to the shops or
something I still do slip these on the
fact that they slip on just makes them
such a good choices that last minute
shoe - if you just need a nip out and
don't want to spend ages putting on
boots and these have been a really
practical choice for that so these ones
are from Zara but I did actually towards
beginning of autumn buy a whole load of
mules I really got obsessed with a whole
mule trend in fact I wrote an entire
blog post on my favorite mules and ways
to style them so I'll leave that linked
down in the description box also down
there you
find links to all the shoes I'm
mentioning in this video as well as some
similar alternatives because I knew that
few of these may have sold out the Zara
ones as our website just isn't very good
so we will leave a few alternatives to
my favorite meals as a whole I just
found mules really practical really
flattering and really on trend this
autumn so this probably won't be the
last pair of mules that I pick up this
season but I might need to wait for the
weather to warm up just a little bit and
hopefully they'll come back into fashion
in springtime my fourth most worn shoes
which actually boots this season are
these almost knee length coppery orangey
Brown colored boots from Karen Millen so
these are just such practical boots they
are suede so you definitely need to make
sure you get some suede protects sprayed
before the first time you wear them in
fact the first time I wore these it was
that day in London where it just
absolutely the heavens opened it was so
rainy and I was getting so stressed out
I spent a fortune on taxis that didn't
want to ruin these even though dashing
between meetings they got completely wet
but actually they have survived there
are no water damage signs on them which
i think is a sign of really good quality
suede and hopefully really good quality
suede spray as well so these still look
good as new I have worn them so many
times since I got them these ones are
definitely my investment boot for autumn
these are not cheap these are 350 pounds
from Carolyn but I feel like with boots
like this there's such a focal point of
your outfit that they almost they make
the outfit so if you do invest in that
one pair of boots that does look really
fabulous like these then almost the rest
of your outfits are elevated by them for
the rest of the season so I did really
see these as an investment piece this
autumn and I have got so much use out of
them because of the way they look they
look great with white jeans they look
great with dresses like jumper dresses
they look great with denim but also the
heel height is just the perfect type of
running around all day but also without
being so high that it's
feet hurt but they didn't give me
because I'm not very tall they do give
me the height boost that I need so
everything about them is just perfect
they fit my leg really perfectly a lot
of boots I find they're a little bit
baggy or I don't know perhaps too tight
but these ones just seem to fit me
absolutely perfectly so really glad that
I invested in these for the autumn
season and I can see myself getting a
lot more use out of these both this year
and in years to come then number three
we have a more casual pair of boots
these ones are from Jules I believe yet
they're from Jules and they are a
classic brown boot with this little
leopard detail and it says leopard
detail that I really love I don't like
leopard too much I just find it a little
bit too bold but I thought this little
hem detail is just so subtle and really
really beautiful and this style of boots
I just think every girl needs a pair
like this in her wardrobe I actually
didn't have a pair like this in my
wardrobe before this pad so as you can
imagine I've been making up for lost
time and wearing these so much now I did
about you guys but even though I'm a
fashion blogger I don't feel the need to
always be dressed up in the latest
trends most of the time in fact as you
guys know if you watch my vlogs I'm
pretty chilled and casual with my
wardrobe so that's why these have come
in so handy with jeans once again ripped
jeans dark denim white jeans they look
absolutely fabulous even if I just want
to dash to the supermarket and I've got
leggings on then these will get thrown
on the only downside to these boots is
that they are not very grippy and the
first time I wore these was when I was
filming my autumn lookbook which I don't
know by the time this goes live if you
have a seen yet but that was actually
the first time I wore them and they were
very slidy on the ground so it wasn't
particularly it wasn't like marble it
was just concrete and I was sliding
around all over the place I had to walk
on the garage so I actually want to take
these two Timpson and get them resold or
get something more if you put on the
sole they haven't been so bad since that
first time but I feel like when it
starts to get icy I will be a little bit
scared to wear these but having said
that I've won them low
I find them incredibly comfortable they
really just add a smart but also not try
too hard and finish to my outfit so as
he loved wearing these and there is such
good quality leather as well they're
very breathable really comfortable yeah
can't wring about these enough apps that
you love them then number two within my
top five most moon boots these once
again are practical and also fashionable
as well these are from EMU and the
reason why these are in my most worn is
because I wear the most weekends for dog
walks for watching child play rugby
because while they are fabulous
fashionable they look like they're suede
in fact I think this may be suede I'm
not too sure I'll leave the information
down below they are 100% waterproof so I
can be walking through a boggy Marsh or
I can be walking like in the pouring
rain and my feet will not get wet in
these I find any waterproof boots
they're almost too good to be true you
don't think you're gonna stay super
drying these but you really really do
and they have a faux fur a bit of
actually thicknesses sheep's wool
yeah sheep's wool it's actually got died
by my jeans I have this really cheap
pair Pinsir hmm and they dyed them which
is really annoying but you can't see it
when I'm wearing them but this bit of
sheep's wool just keeps the tops of your
legs really warm and makes them really
cozy and it's a nice design detailed
whoo they have got a tiny bit of a heel
on them excuse the mud this is a very
authentic video but they've got a really
grippy sole as well so great for long
walks and because secretly I just love
that country lifestyle I have been
wearing these so much and yeah if you
guys haven't checked out any boots
before I highly recommend if they have
so many gorgeous Styles you may remember
in my vlog from the day we went to
Canterbury I also had a burgundy pair of
Amy boots on and they will probably have
been number six if this wasn't a top 5
video no definitely also up there in my
most worn boots but these just pick them
to the post because I wear them every
weekend without fail as well as also
some days in town if I just don't want
to put on boots that I think
it's like uncomfortable I just always go
with these because they're so comfy so
reliable and they look good too and
finally and my most worn of boots this
autumn season and I feel like this is
not going to come as a surprise to any
of you guys
it is my mango boots so these ones I
picked up in an Asus hall that mango but
I got them from a sauce and I have just
not stopped wearing them ever since
every autumn and winter I like to treat
myself to a new pair of black boots
because black boots just go with
everything if you're wearing black
tights you're wearing a dress then these
will just elevate you a little bit of
height but still a comfort of boots if
you're wearing jeans once again there's
just super practical but they look
fabulous as well these ones they just
tick all the boxes they're good quality
leather they have a very good heel
height which really does give me a
height boost but something about the
chunky heel and a very slight platform
within the sole means I don't even feel
the heel when I'm walking so I can run
around in these I still have that
highest height boost but they're still
super super comfortable I also get so
many compliments when I wear them I
think they look so much more expensive I
think Victoria Beckham has a pair of
boots with a very similar design maybe
even Nicholas cup wood as well I'm not
too sure there's definitely another
designer that has boots that looked like
this personally I felt that the circle
looked a little bit like 70s Chloe ish
and the way that they do look so
high-end is definitely the reason why
I've bought them but even without them
being like a dupe I just still love them
either way and as you can tell we're the
sole so it's a little bit gross but I've
worn these so much and I plan to
continue wearing them for the rest of
this year and in the future as well so
because black boots are such an autumn
essential and wardrobe essential in
general I am very tempted to buy the
gucci boots i know i've mentioned in
another video but i'm almost i don't
know i'm just waiting for that one sign
that tells me i need to buy them i'm not
sure what that sign is but I'm a very
big believer of if it's meant to be able
be so yeah I'm just hoping something
will come along and spur me to buy the
gucci boots before they sell out oh my
gosh I feel like I'm not taking the
plastic off these properly gosh that's a
little bit embarrassing and but you
I am definitely considering buying Gucci
boots so let me know if any of you guys
have got them or what you think of them
up it yeah that can be my next shoot I
think just biding my time saving my
pennies before making the big purchase
so those are my top 5 most worn autumn
shoes I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video and found it very interesting
and maybe you've got a few things now to
add to your shopping wishlist as well
honestly all these boots have been worn
and loved so much by me already this
year
and I predict I'll be wearing them a lot
more in the coming months as well and
throughout winter and probably spring
summer autumn winter next year as well I
just love from water pieces they have
been all really good price per wear I've
got a really good value out of them even
the more expensive ones I feel like I've
already worn them an outfit for them to
earn their keep so I will leave all
links below as well as any similar
options for those that are sold out but
I think most of them fingers crossed and
still be in stock so check the
description box as always if you'd like
to pick any of them up or just find out
