having a really fabulous day today I'm
feeling so summery today the Sun is
beaming through the windows and I'm in a
really filming mood so this is the third
video film today hopefully I'm not -
today's video is going to be about my
five favorite high end Holy Grail items
I need to come up with a catchy title my
top five ever high end items by all-time
favorite five high end items in this
video I'm basically going to show you
five of my all-time favorite high end
beauty products I know I talked about a
fair few high end products on this
channel and it may not be to everybody's
budgets so I thought I would whittle it
down to just five things that if you
forced me to I could not live without
so let's not ramble and let's get
started so I hope that on my channel I
do give a reasonably fair balance of
high-end and affordable makeup and I
have to say I absolutely love both there
is something just so nice about using a
really high end product that has
gorgeous packaging they just always feel
and look so laborious so there are so
many that I absolutely love and it was
quite challenging choosing just five but
then equally I adore drugstore products
when it comes to things like mascaras
foundations the drugstore has got it so
right there are so many incredible
incredible options and so if you would
like me to do a drugstore version of
this video maybe my top 5 or top 10 top
10 top 10 ever drugstore beauty items
then I definitely let me
and comments below but today's video is
going to be all about those high-end
items I could not live without the first
item may not come as a surprise to you
if you watched a few of my favorites
videos recently and it is the Tom Ford
lipstick in the shade
time this is without a doubt my
signature lip color it's what I'm
wearing right now and I actually have
laid this over the top of a keeper
lipstick so not only do I adore adore
adore wearing this on its own or with
lip liner I really like to wear it with
Rimmel exaggerate
or a Lancome liner which is a little bit
lighter and it just looks absolutely
gorgeous with either of those I also
love to wear on its own or later the top
of something else but this has become my
really easy to wear go to everyday
lipstick but with a bit of liner or
choosing the right liner it can be very
easily dressed up for an evening look as
well so such a beautiful multitasking
lipstick erase and close up some
swatches of this and if you're ever
watching my snapchat so of logsam want
to know what I'm wearing then there's a
99% chance this this I find the pink so
flattering it's really girly but without
being too kind of in-your-face girly
it's also very sophisticated very chic
just I just actually love this shade
it's such a perfect color for me the
formula is matte which is my favorite
lipstick texture and but it's not so mad
that it's drying out the lips you can
see my lips at the moment there is a
tiniest bit of not shine but kind of
below that comes from a hydrated lips so
while it is Matt it's not hydrating or
drying on the lips in any way and it's
really long lasting so honestly I don't
have a bad word to say about this the
only slight downside is the price but I
think it is so worthwhile splashing out
on good quality lipstick and if I was to
choose from all my tomboi lipsticks this
one would be the one next up is perfumes
and I've chosen
this one which is the germ alone nashi
blossom cologne really because it's
their newest launch but actually I would
say that German in perfumes as a whole
are part of my top 5 Holy Grail and
makeup and beauty products because their
perfumes are always they always just hit
the nail on the head with their
fragrances they seem to know what kind
of smell I want before I even want it
like this one is just so light and
refreshing perfect spring perfect the
summer perfect for traveling when you
don't want that kind of dusty travel
smell in fact I've decant a little bit
of this into my mini travel spritzer and
I'll be taking this on holiday with me
the bottle for this one is just
absolutely gorgeous I love the little
polka dot design little lid it's just so
beautiful but it's really uplifting and
fresh whereas in the winter I love to
wear pomegranate noir it's really
warming kind of musky a little bit Moody
very very comforting
so German own fragrances are definitely
within my top-five beauty products of
all time I do think as a whole it's
worth investing in perfumes I think
there's just something so lovely about
hiring fragrances I love Joe Malone I
love Galen Tom Ford I just really don't
think you can compare cheaper perfumes
to the luxurious ones and for that
reason I just always always reach for a
luxury perfume and my favorite being gem
alone next is a foundation which you're
probably sick of me talking about
because I know I talk about it so much
but it's the Galliano terracotta Jolly
teint beautifying foundation for
sunkissed healthy glow and I first used
this in January when I went to Costa
Rica and it was such a great foundation
for wearing when you're on the go
because it gives a lovely hydrated glow
to the skin and also the most beautiful
beautiful coverage it's not too cakey
but still really gives you a perfected
foundation base I love that it's so
light it's not in one of these chunky
big square glass bottles so it's perfect
for traveling which is why I've been
using its own
recently it's also as if you have 20s
they can wear on the beach wear it out
and about and not worry too much about
sun damage and yeah I just don't have
anything negative to say about this so
this this year already is like my number
one foundation and I love it
next up is an eyeliner and this is the
Tom Ford eye defining pen it actually
has two ends but I can't really tell the
difference between the two of them
they're just both equally skinny nips
one of them being a little bit longer
and less stiff than the other one but
this I use every single day it's
SuperDuper easy to create a perfect cat
flick I don't actually think I've put
mine on today but it's really easy to
create a perfect cat flick it's a very
intense black so you don't need to worry
about going back over it or you know it
fading throughout the day and because
the nibs are so fine you can really get
close to the lash line and create a
really perfected point it's also super
long-lasting super intense black and I
just love it it's fabulous it looks
great in the packaging once again
nothing negative to say about this last
but not least is a bronzer and again
when it comes to bronzers I do think
high-end
wins over high street every single time
you're pretty not surprised to see this
as I did feature it in my end of your
favourites way back in January feels
like a year ago and it's the hourglass
ambient lighting bronzer in luminous
bronze light I have tried a lot of
Francis this year many of which I've
absolutely loved
I love Tom Ford's bronzer I love all the
gallon bronzers a lot but when I just
want a flawless lovely beautiful going
bronze it's the hourglass ambient light
bronze that I keep on going back to a
lot of packaging I love the glow that it
gives to my skin under that there's a
mirror in there and I have used this a
heck of a lot last year and this year
and it's still going strong so I think
value for money wise this has done me
very very proud so really glad I invest
in this probably about this
and that's it they are my top five
high-end beauty products that really
didn't take too long a nice quick snappy
video for you guys hope you enjoyed it
and found it interesting let me know in
the comments where your top 5 high-end
beauty products are because I always
find it so interesting as I said there
are so many products out there it's
often really hard to filter through and
find out what people actually love and
use all the time so hopefully you found
interesting knowing what I truly love

basis do subscribe if you are new do you

high-end products as I said there are so
