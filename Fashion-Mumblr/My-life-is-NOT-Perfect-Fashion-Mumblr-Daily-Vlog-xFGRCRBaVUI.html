daily vlog so answer my challenge with
starting drugs in unusual places today
yes where I am stuck in this log so we
are at the top of the gherkin which is
that big glass go conceived Skype group
in London and we are at the very top if
the caffeine is like a 360 degree campus
there's a view behind me it's freaking
amazing
Torquay chard over there London Bridge
is somewhere over there and if you look
yeah so literally as a very very top of
the Gherkin which is pretty amazing here
for Panasonic event they're launching
some new
gadgets which I'm not allowed to talk
about but yeah going to have breakfast
just met up with Ben and I'm here with
Chad's as well so breakfast here and
then it's going to be a busy day of
meeting
and then we've got that ITV premiere
tonight so going to be a fun day and
gonna bring you guys whoever thought
female bloggers were bad look at these
two
male instagramers in action
sorry guys in a good four hours is the
last vlog birthday me one of those days
back-to-back meetings and it just
wouldn't be socially accepted longing
for change but yes I'm going to get a
lot more fun from now on I've got a
afternoon beam out and afternoon tea and
I'm here actually at a place for jokes
Hotel which is right on our hearts the
really beautiful location and then for
the premiere after that but the I need
to do now is relate to the teeth so
let's go into the trick
could not have taken a fatter turd I'm
now in Hyde Park with the lovely avi
over there who's just posted her first
in scrum story and look behind us
so Jukes hotel who kindly put on an
afternoon tea picnic in the park for us
we've got champagne we've got tea and
most excitingly we have sausage dogs not
real ones unfortunately but turns out
that you could have stock friendly hotel
and this is their mascot it's a sausage
table it looks exactly like Dexter which
as you can imagine just amazes me but
yeah look at this tea
so we've got our scones we've got cakes
we've got sandwiches we've got the most
adorable picnic basket champagne and tea
this is the hotel screenshot this bad
boy so Abby and I are going to enjoy the
beautiful British from our weather that
we're currently enjoying and happy
you
Oh
hey guys so I've just got home taking it
all my makeup off because after a day in
London my skin just felt absolutely
disgusting I just long at the time when
I can go home and scrub my face clean
and slather it with Charlotte Tilbury
magic cream so giving myself a mini
facial at the moment had such a lovely
afternoon tea Dukes hotel I think is
such a good idea that right on the edge
of Hyde Park so we just have the most
beautiful picnic we sat outside in the
gorgeous sunshine we had champagne we
had tea um focusing on the makeup behind
me try and turn around a little bit um
yeah and it's also dog friendly and we
got to take home little doggie toys
which is so - is literally Dexter so
that was really good fun and yeah and
then I rushed home and right now I
should really be getting ready for the
ITV premiere so I was meant to be going
to the premiere of a TV program called
Victoria tonight
at Kensington Palace but I'm not sure if
I'm going to go now because
I've just got home and Charlie's not
here
I saw him really really briefly he had
been drinking quite a lot and yeah I
just felt like we were going to argue
all night because he was it oh sorry I'm
really not used to talking about
personal stuff on my vlogs but I feel
like I need to show this side of life I
care for my vlogs because they're always
very perfect and but yet so chai we were
basically going to be arguing all night
if we went and chose now go off with his
friends to the pub or something so yeah
I think I might just stay home I don't
don't really want to go out and be
worrying about charlie all night but
yeah I don't want to make this into a
gloomy vlog but life's not perfect
relationships aren't perfect mine and
Charlie's definitely isn't I know it
looks lovely and rosy on Instagram and
on our vlogs normally but we do argue
and normally it's all correlated so yeah
tonight it's going to be one of those
evenings sorry from a little bit like
all puffed up so I think I'm not going
to lay him open around that's definitely
not my style I'm going to go down to
dawdle
I'm going to pick up my dog and my
blogger mail and I thought I would open
it with you guys and then Charlie and I
meant to go to the Cotswolds tomorrow
for a nice like wellness weekend so yeah
I need to pack for that hopefully he
won't get home a luxury o'clock in the
morning so yeah not gonna lie here and
be moody Moody yeah let's let's go down
to toddle times like this that I really
wish Dexter was here but he's with my
mom tonight because obviously we're
going away tomorrow so I'll just have to
cuddle my dukes puppy instead so as soon
as my moisturizer sunk in a little bit
more up on some tinted moisturizer don't
want to scare the dawdle guys hopefully
everything I need for the weekend will
be there hopefully getting some new yoga
gigs I think it's quite a like yoga
weekend so yes in a few minutes go to
dawdle show you some blogger mail and
boxing and then I might just like get
into my pajamas order a pizza all that
eaten so much today did that book
back home again from doddle and as you
just saw this speed unwrapping there's
right you love you bits and bobs
and I think I've got like an allergy to
something as a moment because my eyes so
red and I feel like a half shutting this
so sensitive to light at the moment so
if I look a bit like a zombie that's
probably why and also my brows have got
darker in the couple of days since I had
them done so I don't know why that is I
think maybe it's because the dye is
really like soaking in but yeah
safe to say I don't feel terribly
attractive at the moment shiny skin no
makeup puffy eyes and mega dark brows so
I'm going to flip this around and not do
this face to camera so here are a few of
the lovely bits from my blog a mail haul
for today and firstly there's some
really nice bits or more of Moreh vixa
hopefully said that right which is
really lovely Hungarian that beauty
brand I'm really excited to try this
this is their essence and I've never
tried an essence before so I'm really
excited to try that
then we've got some bits from huda
beauty and huda beauty and excitingly
has just launched in Harrods this in
particular looks like it could be a
potential and competitor of the Kylie
cosmetics lovely matching lip liner and
lash glue and the Samantha lashes which
are rather spectacular so that's
available in Harrods now then we have a
pair of sunglasses and this is from a
website called garment quarter and they
are Valentino look at this what I love
about these is that they're so subtle so
there's no branding apart from that
teeny tiny word there but how gorgeous
today I think they might be my like
everyday sunglasses because they don't
get caught in your hair which is lovely
b2 a little pouch as well then we've got
an Estee Lauder foundation this is a new
one with a cushion kind of Alyssa screw
oh we don't go and yeah kind like a
sponge applicator at the top which does
screw off for hygiene reasons wonderful
and so yeah looking forward to
that ago I think I'll probably do my
makeup with that tomorrow to test that
one out then I was kindly sent a few
bits of underwear from a website called
Freya lingerie and I thought Freya was
just for big boobs but apparently not so
this is a really cute little bra top
with little lacy pattern down at the
bottom which is really delicate and
pretty got a book from the Lonely Planet
and this is quite a good idea so
basically it lists the best free things
to do in every city so free things to do
in Bangkok the Express ferry the golden
mount free things to do o best sunsets
so yeah nice little book from lonely
planet then we have a new perfume this
one's from Marc Jacobs
and they did have one like this before
in the darker green so this must be the
new version divine decadence and then I
also have some bits and bobs from ASOS
which I'm going to have a little Tryon
session now but I'm not going to show
you guys because I am going to film an
ASUS haul video early on next week
in this bag are some bits and bobs that
I got from today's meetings and I'll
quickly show you these this is a new
Bobby Brown palette and Bobby Brown are
bringing out three new palettes of their
city collection this is London I've also
got Paris and there is New York as well
but I don't have that one and they are
just stunning let me show you this well
you've got four beautiful life others
and then gorgeous blush hood in the
bottom and this beautiful lid as well so
really beautiful new launch from Bobby
Brown and I just sync the outer
packaging so cute how beautiful is that
so I'm now going to tidy up this mess
behind me of all my bloggers mail and
stuff from today's meetings and
reflection and then I think I might just
like lay in bed and watch something on
Netflix loads of people have been
telling me about stranger things so I
might give that a start tonight normally
I don't like lay in bed and watch
Netflix because I just feel the need to
always be working but tonight I feel
like I'm going to take a night off I'm
stressing about Charlie and I don't
really want to be concentrating on work
because it probably won't be my best
work so yeah I think I'm going to tidy
up get into bed
maybe have a bit panther session because
haven't treated myself to a proper
relaxing pump session ie not working
with a face mask on in I can't even
remember in a long time so I'm just
running myself at bath now and I'm going
to show you my little setup it's
probably quite loud in here because of
others hats running but let me show you
me my little jumper in kappa i've got my
chi I've got a clipper calomel t we're
just going to chill me out I'm going to
use some L'Occitane or locket an
relaxing bath salts over here Netflix
I'm going to start watching stranger
things I'm going to try this as well as
the salts in the bath so this was
recently sent to me it's all over room
bar foil and it's meant to be incredibly
relaxing it's going to give that a go
but is running got the focus on this
cameras got really bad and I've also got
here I'm also having to use a drug to
wash my hair this one has been chewed as
you can see by a little boy but yeah I
have to use this to wash my hair because
I can't get any water on my eyebrows I
think I'm going to put on a face mask
just while I'm getting ready and I have
not tried this one yet this one is from
the body shop it's the British Rose
plumping mask and I feel like my skin
just needs something nice and relaxing
is going to give that a go just been
devouring these anyone tried these yet
so they are the God the focus on this
camera shocking so I've just demolished
a packet of these kettle bites
mozzarella and pesto I pretty much knew
I was going to love these and yeah they
are delicious okay I've already decided
this is not the kind of thing I want to
watch in the bath it looks really scary
so I'm going to pause it before anything
comes out of that door and and I'm going
to watch some YouTube instead much safer
option not my own youtube channel of
course that would be wicked also I just
poured some of this in the bath and it's
literally the most amazing smelling
thing I think I've ever smelled it's the
old room bath oil made with natural
essential oils and yeah you can kind of
see the oil on top of the bath I need to
slush Finn but it smells good I'm not
sure if you didn't see me very well
right now but I just got out of the bath
and so nice so just relax I think I'll a
lied lied in there layin and bath for a
good hour watching YouTube videos which
was wonderful and yeah I'm going to
slather a little moisturizer on my face
now maybe even like the origins drink up
just to give my skin some really nice
moisture and voids up with a focus on
this camera today it's really messed up
and ya gonna put on face cream and stick
on some Netflix gonna finally get around
to watching stranger things I'm not
going to be too much of a chicken now
still no sign of Charlie hopefully he'll
be home soon it's why it's only half ten
I guess he can stay out a bit longer
than that
yeah hopefully doesn't wake me up when
he comes in later sorry today's vlog has
been a little bit of a downer not as fun
and bubbly as usual but hey ho vlogs are
meant to be more real life on nay and so
yeah that's what today was like and I
hope you didn't mind this vlog being a
little bit more negative Nelly but
hopefully try and I will make up
tomorrow morning and all will be
forgotten and forgiven and because yet
we've got the lovely weekend in the
Cotswolds at the lakes which should be
really good fun so yeah I'm gonna sign
off now and um I'll see you soon
