joining me for today's video in this
video I thought I would do a first
impressions and new in type video for
the month of August because this month
there are so many incredible new beauty
products coming out and I really wanted
to firstly I wanted to try them myself
and secondly I thought would be a good
idea to try them on camera live so that
you can see my first impressions so a
lot of these products that I've got laid
out in front of me are brand new so
they're coming out this month or they've
come out very very recently and one or
two of them are just new to me so I
haven't tried these products before this
could be quite a long video so I'm not
gonna do a huge long rambling intro what
I will say is that if you're new to my
channel then please do subscribe because
I'm really making a lot more videos than
usual this month so if you subscribe and
you won't miss any of my videos I will
leave all my blog and social media
channel links down below as well as all
of the product links and if I do forget
to mention any launch dates then all of
that kind of information will be down
below as well so skincare wise I have
used my normal summer skincare routine
which I mentioned in my summer every day
make a video which went live last Sunday
I'll leave that link down below if you
want to see what I've got on my skin
already so I'm already cleansed and
moisturized the first thing I'm going to
put on my face in today's video is the
Laura Mercier foundation primer and this
is a classic product but I have never
tried it before which is quite crazy
because I know it's such a cold product
and I actually visited the Laura Mercier
counter there's a new counter in
Selfridges I've got way too much there
so so Laura Mercier and now in the main
Beauty Hall in Selfridges of a really
fantastic location look how much I've
got this is like one of those moments
when you run out of the product and you
think about those times where you poured
far too much on your hand but yeah I
went for a counter appointment at the
new Laura Mercier counter in the
Socrates Beauty hall and I really got to
discover the brand in a way that I
haven't done before so this is a
beautiful primer that isn't like that
mattifying silicone effets
it feels really light and fresh on the
skin it doesn't feel like it's drying my
skin out it's gonna tie my hair up in a
little bun let's make this a bit easier
so I've given it the primer a few
moments just to sink in and I have to
say texture wise my skin feels in a
really good condition
to apply makeup so just genius bit tacky
but without being you know mattified
bits silicone or anything like that from
a few other primers on my lips I always
like to put on a balm just before I get
started because my lips are generally
quite dry and I'm going to use the
L'Oreal super bond no sexy balm for this
I've actually been trying these for a
little while but I haven't spoken about
them on my channel before so I thought I
would use this this shade I haven't
tried before it's number 102 in the
shade gossip and it's quite a light pink
so very natural color so it's really
just there to be used as a balm rather
than a lip color so I will be applying
an actual lip product later so this
really has just moisturized my lips a
little bit so they're more comfortable
and added a very delicate color to start
with for my base I'm going to use the
Clarins BB skin that detox fluid this is
a new launch and I kind of knew I was
going to love it before I even tried it
because I've always always loved the
clients tinted moisturizers I used to
reserve them for going to the gym or no
makeup days but actually recently
especially as I've been on holiday once
again I've got far too much I found that
actually where's my sponsor ago I found
that actually they are enough coverage
for what I want at the moment and also
again recently since actually my Laura
Mercier counter appointment I've been
using a sponge to apply my makeup and I
just find that this makes it go on a lot
more naturally it does take a bit longer
normally I'd use a foundation brush and
this is hilarious but actually my Zoe
for 102 silk finish brush fell down the
back of my cabinet and I've been far too
lazy to hold the cabinet out and get it
so that's another reason but as you can
see it has gone on to my skin in a
really natural way hopefully because I'm
using natural light and you can see
quite clearly the effect that it has on
my skin but instead of also swirling
like I do with a foundation brush I'm
just tapping it on which gives a really
lovely natural finish absolutely love
how this has turned out my skin it feels
like I'm not really wearing anything it
looks like my skin which is great it
doesn't look like I've got makeup on and
this has got just like all the right
ingredients for being good to your skin
so it says on the back is 100% mineral
it's SPF 25 is oil-free so it is really
good for your skin and I find that
applying with a Beauty Blender just
makes it go in very naturally and really
does look like skin I've as I said I'm
very new to apply my makeup with a
Beauty Blender but I really like the
shape of them the corners of them make
sure that you get really close to that
the inner corner of your eye you can get
really close around the nose so great
for a really natural finish for the
makeup sometimes I use a face mist this
is the body shop vitamin E face mist but
I find that gives a little bit more of a
sheer coverage more sheer yeah it gives
a more sheer coverage if you use a spray
and because this is a tinted moisturizer
I wanted to give more of a coverage so
that's the base next I'm going to go in
with some concealer and these are
recently sent to me by what we Brown
very kindly and they aren't the new kind
of concealer crayon as the official name
is let's have a look
retouching face pencils so I've got a
few different shapes here and I'm not
too sure if these are out yet but can I
lose the information down below
I've got light/medium porcelain
deep so one for every skin tone and I'm
going to use this shade light for
covering a few blemishes and porcelain
for under my eyes so these are almost
like crayons they're quite quite thick
texture so not as buttery as other
crowns that I've tried in the past so
let's see how they go on to my skin
first of all I'm going to put a little
bit of light on the back of my hand
scribbling it on there and I'm gonna use
my finger to put that over my blemishes
and for a little bit more coverage on my
chin I'm just gonna scrape it straight
from crayon onto my finger and then
apply that onto my chin where I do have
a bit of redness I have to say I'm
really surprised by the amount of
coverage that I'm getting just from
transferring the product onto my finger
because a little bit unhygenic tight for
all over your face but I guess we're
going to use for contouring you could do
that but I've just patted that into my
chin and as you can see it's got rid of
the redness that was there previously
and just by passing it in and I still
haven't lost that really natural texture
I do worry that this could be a little
bit thick for the delicate under eye
area I'm going to give it a go so this
is the lightest shade again I'm just
warming it onto my finger and I'm going
to dab that really gently on the under
eye area and I'm hoping that because of
the consistency of the pencil this will
be quite long-lasting really pleased
with how that's come out I'm actually
going to take a little bit more of this
again just on my finger and I'm going to
Pat this onto my eyelids to create a bit
of a base for the eye makeup okay I'm
really pleased with that effect
hopefully this will be a really nice
long-lasting way of concealing and
prepping my eyelid area the next thing
I'm going to do is set my base and for
the
I'm going to use the new Bobby Brown
retouching powder this is something I've
not used before it still got a little
sticker on the inside here so let's get
rid of that so these are loose powders
which is definitely my favorite powder
consistency I find it the most most
natural-looking and I'm taking my Real
Techniques 300 brush I think it's
actually a blusher brush I quite like
how precise this is I've packed some
powder in the lid swirling my brush
around and then I'm just going to apply
that on the areas that could potentially
get a little bit oily so on my chin and
then under my eyes to set those crayons
I feel like they're part of the same
range retouching pencils and retouching
powder so hopefully this will work
really well to set my under eye
concealer just looking in my mirror here
and I'm really really liking the effects
is giving it's not adding it too much
cakiness also having any cakiness to my
skin but it's actually giving me a
really lovely airbrush effect which is
very flattering I have to say hopefully
the camera is picking it up so first
impressions of this powder are very good
I'm just again at tapping this over my
forehead and this hopefully will prevent
any shine later in the day also I have
to say I really like the size of this
powder it's about 2/3 of the size of
normal kind of powder pots which is just
fine I mean I think any bigger and
you're just wasting wasting draws space
I'm really happy with the size of this
pot so just tap this over the rest of my
face whatever's left on my brush I'm
just patting that around because as I
mentioned my skin does get a bit or you
later in the day so hopefully this will
just keep it in place also within that
range from Bobby Brown there's another
powder also called retouching powder and
this is in the shade
Rose whereas the one I used before was
number five white I'm not sure if you
can use a rose colored powder all over
your face so I'm going to try applying a
little bit of this on my cheeks where I
would apply blusher so we'll see if this
is actually pigmented enough to use as a
blush I'm going to use the same
technique just popping a little bit and
lid swirling my brush
tie it to my cheeks
so I'd say this is ever so slightly
tinted I think maybe if you want to do
some color correcting and you could
probably apply this all over your face
for me I think it would be too pink but
actually as a very subtle blush this is
absolutely beautiful so I'm gonna leave
that there just is a very subtle blush
but once again really impressed with the
consistency of these powders from Bobbi
Brown as always by this stage I'm bored
of doing my complexion so next thing I'm
going to do is my brows recently I was
given these to try and these are the
NARS brow defining cream and I think
this is a new launch correct me if I'm
wrong but I think this is brand new I've
certainly never seen or heard of these
before and on that note Naza is actually
now available on look fantastic which is
amazing so I absolutely love that
website and yep now they are selling nas
which is fabulous so I'm going to apply
some of this with my Anastasia brow Wiz
pencil it's a pump prowess on my
Anastasia brow pencil because firstly I
can comb through my brows using the
spoolie side and then use the angled
brush from the other side to add in the
brow gel cream so the nas looks like
this shade wise I've got the shape
sonoran which is quite a is a blonde
shade but it's still a little bit
brownie so hopefully it's gonna be the
perfect color for me I'm gonna take my
angled brush wipe that across the top it
feels quite dry initially so I'm going
to scrape a bit of balance the back of
my hand so it's a little bit more
moldable and then I'm going to apply
this underneath my brow just so I can
get an idea of this shape and the color
color wise it seems to be very similar
to my brow which is wonderful so I'm
just going to again create that lower
line and then
start swiping it upwards to bring it the
cream it's through my brows but I just
move a bit closer so that you can see
what I'm doing so once again just taking
a little bit of the product onto the
back of my hand along with all my
foundation of lipstick swatches so I've
got enough on my brush that it's going
to give a decent amount of coverage and
I'm going underneath my brow this is
just to really define the shape and then
I'm swiping it upwards which very subtly
and brings the product through my brows
and this again is a technique that I
learnt at the Laura Mercier counter and
it just helps to add color to my brows
while keeping that natural shape and
keeping it looking really natural
because with creams you're always in the
danger of making it a little bit thick
but this technique I find works really
really well color wise this is
absolutely perfect for me so I'm gonna
fill in the next brow really really
pleased with how this has come out and
with my previous experience with brow
creams I find them really long-lasting
so I will leave a note on the screen now
as to how long my brows lasted because I
do not like looking in the mirror at the
end of the day and findings that have
gapi brows again I had planned to show
you another brow product from Laura
Mercier these are their new browser
dimension and they have the shade blonde
and brunette but I'm going to show you
them but I'm not going to apply them
because I actually feel like using the
NARS brow cream my brows actually feel
pretty set so I think if you just want
to use one product on your brows this is
a really good one I don't really feel
like I need to set them in place further
like these would do but basically I
tried these on counter and they are new
brow gels and you can use them to shape
your brow add color to your brow at the
thickness you can kind of like back home
with them and they do have fibers in
them so if you have Gery gabrels or like
your brows aren't as full as you like
them to be like myself I have that
problem these are fantastic because like
those mascaras that have fiber filaments
these have them or your brows which is
just amazing but
feel that they'd work very well on top
of brown cream so I'm not going to use
them right now
moving back to base next thing I'm going
to use is the Sun designer palette from
by Terry and I don't think this is a new
one but it's new to me I actually only
got this a couple of days ago and it is
stunning so this is the palette it's got
bronze kind of like highlighter shades
over there and beautiful blush powder on
this side as well as a ginormous mirror
hello camera as well as a bunch I
Norma's mirror on the lid so I'm going
to use my Sigma brush to apply but at
the bronze
I don't know wow I was going to say I
don't know what the color payoff is but
straight away there's a lot on the brush
so it's gonna really lightly tap that
and apply this up to my cheekbones I
always apply in the kind of contour
place first because if you do go too
dark and it's easy to blend out in those
areas
and then I'm going to swirl it over my
forehead second cheekbone actually
considering how much product it looked
like there was on the flat on the brush
it's not come out too heavy on my face
it's nice and natural as always when I
apply bronzer I try to apply for the
areas like the Sun would naturally hit
so as well as adding a bit of shape with
the contour area and I go around my
hairline blend it in to face under the
chin again for shape and then just
filling in any areas with whatever's
left on my brush I guess with this
palette you could be more selective so
I'm going to swipe my brush along the
bottom area where it's darker and then
go back in under my cheekbone for
traditional contour and never go too
close to your mouth because it just
makes your face it dirty so I'm really
stopping at about two fingers distance
from my mouth one thing about this
bronzer is that incredibly is that it is
incredibly blendable so if you like me
aren't a pro at contouring then it's
very easy to correct and blend if you
don't make it look that natural you
first go in so that's a great thing
about this bronzer color wise it's
actually very matte on my skin it looks
this bottom shade in particular looks
quite shimmery but actually it's come
out very matte which is a really lovely
effect especially in summer when you've
got a glowy base it's nice to have a
matte bronzer I think it's a really
beautiful contrast so really happy with
that I'm going to also try this lush
shade it's so it's a powder blush
actually no I'm gonna try a cream blush
because I haven't tried a cream for a
little cream blush in it's so long and
I'm really excited to try one from Estee
Lauder where is that this is the genuine
glow blush in crema for lips and cheeks
and I've been time to try this so long
firstly I just absolutely adore the
packaging it is so like my kind of dream
packaging a baby pink metallic with a
matte kind of area around the middle it
just looks absolutely stunning
oh I was expecting this to be a pump but
it's actually a stick so I'm going to
use a blusher brush here it is this is
the Sigma zero fiber powder blush in f15
and I'm going to swipe this over the top
of the blush and it looks quite
pigmented on my brush once again so I've
got plenty of the blush product on my
brush you could probably apply it
directly with your fingers but I'm much
more confident using a brush so applying
that direct to my cheeks it's a very
very subtle color payoff I think I might
add a bit more product so as you can see
it's a very creamy consistency it's
adding a really beautiful glow to my
cheeks it looks really fresh and a lot
more natural than powder I think that's
the main benefit of using a cream blush
is that it looks more like your skin so
it's a lot more natural this is a really
subtle color very natural color which I
really really like sometimes I've tried
I go overboard on blush just because
you're never too sure on a consistency
but this is a really beautiful natural
color I could apply this to my lips as
well but I have a few more products that
I would like to give a go on the lips
but I think color wise this would be a
really gorgeous tint for the lips on a
very natural makeup look day I'm going
to focus on my eyes next and the first
product I'm going to use is from the
exact same range it's the Estee Lauder
genuine Glo and lightening cream for
eyes and face and this um is a spongy
tip applicator and inside I can see that
the cream is like a golden shimmery
shade so you could use it for
highlighter could probably squeeze a
little bit out and use this a highlight
on the face but I'm actually going to
use it as a base for my eye shadow by
applying a little bit of this onto the
eyelids it's going to make the rest of
my eye look be quite shimmery and just
very fresh and shiny shiny for summer so
I'm just gonna dot this on you can see
it's like a gold color very very subtle
if you don't want a sparkly eye look
then don't worry it's much more subtle
than that but because it has got
I'm going to apply in the corners of my
eyes as well so just using my finger to
Pat this in and by the way I'd say the
size that I took was about a third of a
grain of rice so this is going to last a
long time which is really good for a
luxury product I actually really like
this look just on its own so you can see
it's just given me a very natural bronzy
shimmer to my eyes you could leave it
like this but I knew that this is a
really good base for your eye makeup so
I'm now going to apply some eye shadow
on top of that and the palette that I've
chosen to use today is the new models
own dare to bear palette now this one I
discovered recently and all the shades
are just so perfect look at that
beautiful beautiful shades in basically
every color that I use so you've got
some whites some really good dark crease
colors and then loads of really natural
like everyday kind of colors so me once
again you've got a huge mirror in the
lid and for once a budget I shadow
palette that actually has a decent brush
so you've got a double-ended brush in
here with two usable brushes so none of
these series sponges so I'm actually
gonna try this brush to apply their
eyeshadow today first of all I'm going
to use the shade it's skin as you might
be able to guess from the name I feel
like it's going to be very natural to my
eyelid color so create a really lovely
bit so using the brush I'm applying this
all over the lid and even though it is a
matte shade over the top of the Estee
Lauder genuine glow it's still got a
really beautiful natural shine coming
through and then what's left on my brush
I'm just bringing that up towards the
eyebrow and that's created a really
beautiful base for the rest of my eye
makeup look so it's very similar to my
natural eye color so I'm going to add a
little bit more definition with a darker
shade and I'm going to go in with unzip
which is a lighter of the dark brown
shades and I'm going to apply that in my
crease area just using the exact same
brush but this really adds a little bit
more definition and almost contours the
eye
this is more
grades and I would normally go for but
I'm actually really really liking it and
because the brush that comes with the
palette is quite slim I'm bringing that
underneath my lower lash line which
again adds even more definition really
pleased with that as it is called the
dare to bear palette it's definitely
going for a more natural look which I
absolutely adore highly recommend this
palette Ashley I'm just yeah really
impressed with those colors lots of
really really good colors in there and
just because I'm dying to try it I'm not
gonna stop there on the eyes but I'm
going to use a shade from the new Urban
Decay moondust palette now I got my
hands on this a couple of maybe like a
week or so ago and I have been dying to
try it how beautiful is this so you've
got this gorgeous black sparkly palette
with the words moon dust written in
there the inside look at these shades so
many gorgeous super bright super
pigmented glitter shades as we know and
love from Urban Decay the lovely lady
that introduced me to this palette was
actually wearing this one when we met
and it is Spectre suspect err yeah
Spectre and it looked actually stunning
and she told me that all she did was
applied a pop of it over the top of her
existing eyeshadow using her finger so
I'm gonna try and replicate that so I'm
just going to swirl my finger over the
top of it and I can see that it's like
an iridescent almost moonlight pearly
Sheen which is beautiful so I'm just
going to then top that over my eye
shadow oh my god that is so stunning wow
that looks beautiful
I don't if you can pick that up that far
away I would do some close-ups at the
end but this is just oh my gosh and I'm
not a sparkly eye person at all I think
the good thing about this shade as well
is because you can clearly see that it
is pink shimmer but it is probably one
of the more
shades of the bunch you can still see
that gray brown contour that I did
earlier and I'm honestly not a sparkly
eye shadow person but this is stunning I
didn't say so myself oh and because I
don't really wear eyeliner in these
summer months I'm going to use a bobby
brown smokey liner brush and one of the
darker shades I'm going to use a shade
raw from the dead fair palette so I'm
just going to take a small amount of
that on the Bobbi Brown brush and press
that into my lower lash line and this
defines the eyes enough but without
needing actual eyeliner so I'm just
using a dabbing motion to really press
this into the lash line and you can see
instantly it just defines the eyes a
little bit more than where I don't have
it but without that need for liner and
again gonna bring that down under the
lash line too and this is also a really
beautiful way of creating a very gentle
and soft smokey eye if you're not
confident enough to really go for a bold
smoky eye just using a liner brush and a
darker shade around the lash line is a
beautiful way of just adding a gentle
smoky effect to your eyeshadow so this
is the eye with the shadow around the
lash line and this to the eye without so
I'm gonna even them out before going in
with mascara for mascara I'm using the
Clarins mascara it's super volume I just
I'm a huge fan of Craig's mascara and
this is a new one for they're not from
of this late summer or that autumn
collection but either way it is coming
out soon and it is a brown mascara if
you want to have a more natural slightly
softer look to your eyes then Brown
mascara is definitely the way forward
and this is my favorite one at the
moment by a long stretch first of all
I'm going to curl my lashes and no
actually these are not to my usual
roseburg tweezer and ones but these are
from Primark I think I paid maximum to
pound 50 for these so I've been
intrigued to see whether these are as
good as my tweezer on ones and there
a lot cheaper so giving my lashes a
gentle squeeze with the eyelash curlers
to be honest I don't really see that
there can be that much difference at all
my lashes are curled just as well as
they would be with the tweezer mag ones
and yeah they're a fraction of the price
so definitely head to Primark if you
want to pick up some rose gold lash
colors and then taking the Clarins
mascara just wiggling that really close
to my eyelid yeah so it's really close
up to the actual skin at the very base
of the eyelashes that creates a little
bit more a little bit more depth and a
little bit more drama to the eyes
especially as you skipped out the liner
so we're going it very very close to the
base of the lashes and then refining it
out got a hair stock and even though
this is a brown mascara it's very dark
brown so as you can see my lashes are
really beautifully defined but just not
as harsh as opposed to use a black
mascara can you actually see how good
this mascara is so I've done one coat
and they are so fanned out and just so
natural looking I'm so impressed I just
wanted to bring you in so you could see
how amazing this mascara is so this is
obviously with and without mascara next
I'm going to move on to my lips and it
was honestly a big struggle to decide
what to include or what to do on my lips
because there have been so many
incredible launches recently one that
I'm really intrigued to try is this one
and this is the Too Faced melted matte
lip cream lip cream lip matte it's
called a lipstick but I'd say it's kind
of like a lip cream um but yeah I'm
gonna try this first and I'm probably
going to layer on something else
afterwards because I just can't bear the
thought of it using one lip product so
this is a new launch from the Too Faced
I have got the shade feelin myself is
the name of the shade and it's beautiful
coral color great for summer and I think
it'll go really nicely with this look
because we did go although a little bit
shimmery on the eyes still very natural
so this will be a reboot aful bold color
so yeah just going to apply this onto my
lips not going to attempt to talk and
say
I'm so here goes put it on my teeth
already that's a good start
Wow so as you can see the color payoff
on the melted matte lipstick is
absolutely incredible this is I didn't
even need to read it my brush I just
scraped the excess off one time apply it
to my bottom lip and then post my lips
together as you saw to transfer onto my
top lip and then use the applicator to
even it out around the edges I did not
even use a lip liner and it's gotten
gone on so beautifully the applicator
itself although nothing fancy is nice
and slim which means that it really does
help you to follow the curve of your
lips so no lip liner or lip brush
necessary I have to say I do not
normally wear bright clothes on my lips
or anyone for that matter but I bloody
love this lip color it's just so
gorgeous and looking in my viewfinder
there and I love it I think I need to
wear bright colors more often I would
say it is very attracted to my teeth so
I'm gonna have to keep double-checking
at home gotten it on my teeth although
having said that I feel like in a few
moments it's going to have dried and
it's not going to be going anywhere but
what do you guys think of this color
should I wear a bright lip colors more
often I think that with a really kind of
perfected base it's still a bit of glow
but not too glowy and fairly neutral
eyes kept them soft with lack of liner
and using a brown mascara I think a bold
lip something you can definitely get
away with wearing and in summer with a
natural makeup look texture wise this is
not drying in the slightest or doesn't
feel drying at all right now
remember I did put balm on about 20
minutes ago so that's definitely going
to have helped but it feels so
comfortable on my lips and I do not feel
like it's going anywhere so once again
right on the screen now how long this
lasted but I have got good - good
feelings about this it feels really
comfortable it looks great color payoff
is fantastic and yeah I definitely feel
like I
to get a few more cuz of this because
this is a very statement color I'm going
to see if I can get some more wearable
shades because I am a big fan of this
first impressions are 10 out of 10 but
because I didn't want to try it another
lip product I've actually gone for one
that is available on the or in the
drugstore this is from collection and
it's their deluxe
lip lacquer so this again is a lacquer
so highly pigmented but more glossy so
I'm going to try and layering this to
see how it goes over the top of my Too
Faced melted it's going to be shiny so
it's gonna get rid of that matte but I'm
intrigued to see the color of this one I
am loving this combination so I've put
the collection lip lacquer over the top
of my Too Faced and as you can see it's
really kind of light into the color made
it a little bit softer because of course
this is a lighter pink shade so it's
made it a little bit more wearable and
also given that high shine it feels a
tiny bit sticky um but for a drugstore
lip gloss I wouldn't really expect it to
not feel sticky but I just absolutely
love how this looks I feel like I have a
winning combination here and what do you
guys think I just I absolutely love it
and I don't normally have shiny lips but
we're breaking all the rules today and I
am I'm fairly in this combination not
going to like this one that I applied
was the shade prom queen number one I
feel like this would look absolutely
beautiful on his own as well but as we
can see from this example it also works
really well to layer on top of a matte
lipstick as this video is a new in first
impressions I don't want to end on the
makeup so I do actually have to a hair
products that I wanted to talk about for
and talked about as well so first of all
let the hair down it's been in a bun
while it's been kind of drying off so
it's a little bit kinky kinky and
another new launch this month is the new
tangle teasers with Hello Kitty designs
on them which is absolutely adorable so
I went to an afternoon tea at cutter and
switch which is
a little cafe in Soho and they have a
Hello Kitty themed Governments you going
on at the moment which is where I
discovered these this is a handbag sized
one so it's got the kind of shield on
the back which is just so incredibly
handy when it comes to storing your
brush in your handbag and as I'm sure
you guys all know with Tangle Teezer so
just amazing for thick hair that tangles
easily and it really does detangle
without creating frizz or breaking the
hair so as you can see it's just really
smoothing and straightening out the
kinks in my hair so the Hello Kitty
tangle teasers are out this month I just
think that's adorable it comes in a
black shade as well they're literally
just the best a brush as ever so this is
a very exciting new launch for the month
and another very very exciting hair
elated launch is from GHD so I really
really wanted to include this in this
video because as I'm filming this today
is the 1st of August and this has just
come out today and it's the DHD Platinum
electric pink styler in a collaboration
with the Irish Cancer Society and breast
cancer now so for every one of these it
is purchase ten pounds will be given to
the charity which is an absolutely
incredible donation and an incredible
product as well so inside the box
they've got a very snazzy
leather feel I'm not sure that it is
that a carry case and heat proof mat and
then the most beautiful stylus so these
are the platinum stylus you may
recognize them they are these well-loved
platinum designs and you've got a sheath
over top to protect them and then as you
can see beautiful hot pink star as rich
oh my god that is so stunning and then
even the metal down here is like a baby
pink color so I'm now going to go and
style my hair using the stylus as my
first impression of them so I will see
you in a few minutes so as you can see
I'm just taking the GHD tongs and taking
small sections of my hair twisting it
around the straightener is just the
usual curling with straightness routine
and the Platinum stylists are leaving my
hair with a beautiful soft ribbon curl
I'm gonna repeat this around my head and
see you back in a few moments
okay so maybe five minutes later that
really did not take that long at all
and you can see it's just added the most
beautiful big curls to the bottom of my
hair I've also just noticed that the
plates of these stylers are black and
pink sparkly glitter which is amazing
and very exciting if you like pink and
glitter like me as you can see from my
hair I'm obviously not a pro at
straightening or curling my hair this is
just what I tend to do on an everyday
basis I have done videos on how I create
this look but it's just some really
beautiful big and natural curls which I
absolutely love these as I said are out
now they are I believe 165 pounds for
the GHD platinum stylist also within the
GHD electric pink range which is in
support of breast cancer you can buy the
ugh D air hair dryer and also the
classic five I think it's called the v
styler all of those will be donating 10
pounds to the Breast Cancer Charity as I
mentioned earlier which is just really
really lovely just such a good excuse to
treat yourself to a beautiful new hair
product and also if you just wanted to
like buy into it and donate as well you
can get a pink hair pin bag for five
pounds and a pound of that goes to
charity so once again a lovely lovely
collaboration from THD and just a
fabulous product so this is out now if
you needed an excuse to go in upgrade
your straighteners this is if they are
just truly truly wonderful and such a
great course as well I know okay guys so
