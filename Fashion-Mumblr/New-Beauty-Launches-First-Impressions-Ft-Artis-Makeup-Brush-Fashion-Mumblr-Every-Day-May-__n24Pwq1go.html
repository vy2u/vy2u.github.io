first impressions video firstly I'm
really sorry about my voice I'm in the
final throes or at least I hope I'm in
the final throes of the silly cold which
I've had for about a week now and I'm
actually pre filming this video because
if you follow my snapchat all vlogs
you'll probably know that I am in the
middle of my crazy three back-to-back
trips at the moment so I'm pre filming
this so that I have a video to share
with you to attempt to keep up my
everyday main schedule so before I
headed off off on the trips I did have a
day
back-to-back full of meetings and a lot
of the meetings that I had was showing
me a load of new Beauty launches loads
of which I got so excited about and I
was planning on shoving them all on my
face this morning anyway to see which
ones I really really loved and I thought
I would just do that in front of the
camera so that you could see my genuine
first impressions of these products and
I've got some really exciting ones here
ranging from haircare which I actually
used in the shower last night so I'll
tell you quickly about that tiny bit of
skincare really excitingly the artiste
makeup brush which just seems to be like
so much hype around at the moment so I'm
so excited to try that I've also got a
new primer and a makeup brand that I've
not tried before and just a few bits and
bobs so first of all I'm going to tell
you about shampoo and conditioner that I
used last night and it's this Gio from
oh I'm sorry about the lack of makeup by
the way obviously I'm putting it on as
we go but yeah so I tried this shampoo
range for the first time last night this
brand called Maria nila
and the brand is based in Stockholm here
I've got there she is silver shampoo and
conditioner which is ideally for colored
hair preferably blonde colored hair and
the shampoo is bright purple as it
usually is when it's for neutralizing
brassy tones in your hair I used this
last night and I'm not sure if the
camera is picking it up but I think my
hair looks a really beautiful white
light blonde this morning
I let it dry naturally so this is what
it looks like and I'm really really
pleased with the shampoo the conditioner
again really good it's not the strongest
conditioner I've ever tried I wasn't
really expecting it to be but it was
also purple I don't I don't use my
shampoo all the way through the lengths
of my hair I tend to just shampoo the
top and then it naturally run down so
I've really liked that there's a purple
conditioner in the range as well I'm
actually not too sure on the price
points of these but I'll leave them on
the screen now if I can find them and
just reading the bottle hundred percent
vegan produced in Sweden so paraben free
with highlighting black berry and a
color guard complex so all sounds really
good really enjoyed using them I don't
really have anything negative to say
about them to be honest so first
impressions of the Maria nila shampoo
and conditioner are really good also
last night I tried the s bar overnight
hydration therapy nourishing treatment
masque and I actually met the girls who
look after this brand for juice last
night or yesterday afternoon and they
told me that it's a really great master
for skin that is absolutely like thirst
quenched it's really really thirsty and
try and I thought that pretty much
describes on my skin at the moment
obviously I've got this cold my nose is
super dry and they actually said it
would be too strong to use as an
everyday night cream and one of the
girls who swears by it she said that
sometimes when she wakes up there's
still a lot of product on her skin and
she has to wash it off but my skin that
must have been so thirsty because I woke
up and my skin had drunk it all in and
it feels really lovely and plumped and
really hydrated today I have got
moisturizer on ready to do my makeup but
hopefully you can see my skin looks and
it definitely feels really plump and
fresh so really really impressed with
this the packaging is quite cool they've
got this glass little pops and the top
looks like granite which is just I don't
really know what the connection to the
to the product is but I think I'll
probably use this between trips so when
I come back from Sicily where I probably
am now I have about four hours at home
before going to the next strip and I
slamming my face in this I'm actually
also going to put a little scoop of this
into a Muji pot to take it with me
because I think for traveling dry skin
caused by airplane and all that this is
going to be super useful I'm so sorry
about my voice I sound like such an old
crock but I really needed to fill in
this videos I hope you don't okay and
now I'm going to actually start putting
things on my face so you can get some
live first impressions first of all I
need to tie my hair back so bear with me
I swear I had some sunglasses yeah I'm
not a terribly good look but there we go
okay first of all I'm going to put on
the Paula's Choice clear ultra light
daily mattifying fluid now this is SPF
30 so really good for use when you're on
holiday and also here in the UK now that
it's finally getting sunny today looks
like it's going to be absolutely
beautiful I'm using natural light
because I can it's gorgeous out there
and also I think it allows you to see
better what I'm putting on my face so
this is it says protective mattifies the
skin great because I have a oily skin
which needs mattifying and it maintains
clear skin great helps prevent the signs
of aging so all-round sounds like a
really fat product this is available
from the Birchbox website so you might
have tried some poreless choice in your
birch boxes recently Wow comes out
really quickly so just be careful how
you go I might not use this entire bit
and so yeah you might have tried
something similar in your birch boxes so
you can buy a full-size one on a box
website so I've used a lot less than
what came out I'm going to wipe the rest
of her on my leg and I'm going to put
this mainly on the areas that I get
shiny so I get shiny on my nose on my
cheeks chin and forehead pretty much
everywhere then and this isn't
technically a primer but because it
mattifies the skin I think it will do a
good job so I will put a little comment
here that's
how long it lasted and whether it did a
good job because unfortunately I'm not
going to have time to sit down in front
of the camera again today to update you
so there we go that's something really
quickly I feel like I can go straight in
with my foundation now so as I mentioned
I'm going to be trying out an artiste
brush if I'm saying that right artiste
and the founder of artiste used to work
for markers and makeup artists at Mac
and he just thought it was strange that
all makeup brushes were the same angle
like always pointing to the skin when
that's not naturally how we would apply
makeup to our face so he designed these
brushes and which kind of looked a
little bit like a giant toothbrush I
mean it's absolutely beautiful it's this
gorgeous mirror finish silver I have got
I think it's number six yes the oval six
but I think is the most practical brush
in my opinion if you're just going to
buy one because you can use your
foundation you can put blusher on with
it bronzer I might try doing a few
different things with it and the girls
were saying that there are more hairs on
here obviously not as long but more
hairs densely packed here than you have
on a human head so that just gives you
an idea as to how many hairs are on one
of these artist brushes and suddenly I
couldn't go to the launch breakfast but
again the girls were saying that the
founder did a demonstration with this
versus a few different makeup brushes
and it really highlighted how you don't
need anywhere near so much makeup
because the makeup doesn't sink into the
brush instead just applies really
smoothly to the skin so I'm really
excited to try this and I'm glad I'm
filming it to kind of capture my first
impressions and I thought long and hard
about what foundation to try it with and
I thought seeing as this was a first
impressions I would use the NARS Velvet
Matte skin tint this is a very new
launch and how about you used it before
really liked it I'm going to use a
little bit less this time I think the
brush kind of allows you to get away
with using less if you have an expensive
foundation
you don't want it all getting lost in
your brush anyway and also I just want
to have quite a light coverage because I
am getting on a plane later and I hate
having cakey makeup on a plane is I just
put a teeny tiny little smudge of the
NARS Velvet Matte and I'm going to dab
it on with my fingers I'm sure you could
probably dab it on with your teeth brush
I think the tactic I'm gonna be really
careful not to get any on here because
this is white
squishing material I don't want to ruin
it
I think the tactic is not to lift the
brush off your face too much so I'm
going to try keeping it there using
circular motions so let's see how I get
on it's very soft that it's Michelle
feels a little bit unnatural I'm not
sure how maybe I should hold it like
this still not taking it off it feels
like it's really getting close to my
face like really hugging the contours
and really buffing it as we go that
feels really lovely and actually
normally to get this level of finish I
would have to put on a couple of layers
of foundations so really liking how the
finish is because of the size of this
brush I'm able to get quite close to my
inner eye which is nice I thought maybe
it would be too big but because of the
dome it's really easy to get into all
those little contours I do feel like I'm
brushing my teeth on my face a little
bit feels quite strange but I guess
you'll get used to it and soon it'll be
what everybody's doing to apply their
makeup in the morning ah I can't believe
how easily this blends I hope you can
see this on camera but it's making the
blending so
easy actually this foundation is too
pale for me at the moment I'm going to
have to go in with some bronzer I might
try using the NARS Laguna liquid bronzer
with this brush because I think it'll be
really great brush for applying
something of that consistency so I've
just finished doing the first coat of
the NARS Velvet Matte and skin tint on
my face using the brush and the first
thing I have to say firstly how quick
and easy and super blended that was and
also there was no makeup or barely any
makeup on this brush which just shows
that it's done what it should do and
it's put all the makeup on my face so no
wastage which for me is an absolute
bonus I hate any kind of wastage so the
fact that my makeup I mean if you
compare it to this I do love my zoeva
brushes but this is full of makeup it's
like claggy and sticky so I'm gonna go
straight in and use this same brush to
apply the NARS liquid bronzer um so yeah
let's see how it goes okay I want you to
bear in mind I'm not terribly good at
using liquid prawns err just a little um
disclaimer I'm going to start with a
very small amount so I'm not too
confident on how to do it I'm going to
actually use the brush to pick up the
product this time instead of the other
way around so let's try I'm just going
to dab it on there and then I'm gonna go
in on the cheekbones in case it is
really dark Wow
so yes it is very dark I'm going to
blend this up try and do that figure of
three which creates a really beautiful
natural tan look you can do that figure
of three under the chin onto the
cheekbone and up over the forehead
oh wow oh my gosh this looks so nice
Oh guys I have a new favorite thing this
looks amazing
oh I hope you can see it on camera it
really looks like the most natural
gorgeous turn well I'm just dragging it
out under my chin as well especially up
over the forehead it looks so good okay
tapping and bear in mind I used two
tiniest bit on my hand just popping a
little bit more on my hand just to blend
out the second side of my face just a
teeny little dots are not sure if you
can even see it it's so small this is
such a good brush if you want to savor
your product size the thing I'm most
amazed at right now okay so I've
finished applying bronzer and I
absolutely love it
I'm definitely going to using this
little combination more often as I said
I'm really not very good at liquid
bronzer so I'm sure after more practice
this is going to get better but I just
love how fresh and glowing this looks it
looks really natural and my skin just
feels so hydrated and fresh and I used
the tiniest bit of product if only you
guys could see exactly how tiny that was
so really good at making your expensive
beauty products and last longer so first
impressions of the artis brush really
really good I actually was not expecting
to be that impressed by it and I'm
really looking forward to having this in
my daily routine and kind of getting
more familiar with it so I will keep you
guys updated probably lots on snapchat
so make sure you're following that if
you want to see how I get along in a
future with your teeth brush but this
will definitely be coming with me on my
travels
now I'm going to focus on my eyes and
I'm not doing every part of my makeup
routine I'm not doing brows or under-eye
concealer or anything like that so I've
just cherry picked a few products and I
wanted to show you so on my eyelids this
came in the posting of the day this is
for a brand called pure and it's an eye
polish base and top coat the applicator
is really intriguing is all because it's
basically like a silicone spatula like
would you use for
or getting the cupcake mixture out of a
bowl but much smaller and it's a there
was actually a few that arrived but this
one is a Coralie baby pink color so
really beautiful color and I think
they'll make a really lovely base color
inside the pot I hope you can see that
there is like a mesh and it looks like
there's some liquid coming out the mesh
so not entirely sure if what I'm about
to do is the right way to apply it but
basically I'm just going to stick the
spatula on to the mesh pushing it down
quite hard oh gosh that's really strange
yeah I'm really pushing down to the
bottom of the mesh it's quite springy
and now my spatula is covered in this
pink e-liquid and I'm just gonna go
straight on and apply this directly to
my island oh I'm actually surprised by
the color payoff I thought it'd be very
uneven so you definitely need to go in
once per eye and now I'm just gonna Pat
that in with my finger and it's given a
very shimmery base to the eye so if you
prefer a matte eye and probably not the
one for you
and I do like a bit of shimmer on the
eyes so I'm gonna go in again second
time round for the other eye there we go
so both eyes are now primed again I will
leave a note here letting you know if it
made my eye shadow last any longer
because as I said I'm not going to be
able to come back to this video but I'll
leave some notes here
and the eye shadow that I am going to
apply is for a run for Anzac eye which I
absolutely love first discovered them in
the Liberty shop in London and I've just
been obsessed with them ever since I
have so many of their products this is
their mermaid eye color in the shade
seashell which just looks absolutely
gorgeous it's a beautiful light golden
color really nice for a natural kind of
summery look a really lovely Beach look
and I'm just going to use my zoeva which
one is this the 231 luxe petit crease
brush this is kind of like a creamy
powder I can't say it's a powder and
it's definitely not a full-on curry
so quite an unusual consistency
something interesting to see how bold it
comes out but I'm just gonna apply this
directly to the lid and wow that's
really beautiful it's a very I'm not
sure how much of the shimmer is coming
from the base coat but it is a very
shimmery gold really retour kind of
quite quite pigmented and quite opaque
when it comes to covering my eyelid if
that makes sense
so sometimes Gold's will just add
shimmer they won't cover your eyelid
color if that makes sense but this
really has colored in my lid as well
which I really like I'm gonna apply that
in the corners just clean my eye look a
little bit more awake and then blending
it into the crease and that's really
really lovely a very subtle everyday
kind of summer makeup really nice to add
maybe over the top of your eyeshadow if
you want to wear it in the evenings just
add a bit of shimmer but because I want
to experiment a little bit more I'm
going to use another one from Sean sky
and it's the mermaid eye color same
thing in the shade Lagoon so this looks
quite greeny in the pot but I actually
swatched it on my hand and it looks more
of a brownie green in the lighter shine
screen but it's quite brownie so I'm
gonna put a little bit of this close to
my lashline and in the corner set to
build a bit of depth so let's see how
this applies over the top I'm just using
the same brush because it's quite narrow
on the edges
interestingly it's more green on the eye
than it was on my hand
although mixed with the gold it's a very
muted I think mermaid green is
definitely the right term for it so
really beautiful color and I'm actually
gonna drag that down under the eye as
well to make it blend a little bit more
seamlessly so this is how it looks at
the moment I'm going to go in with the
zoeva luxe crease brush and I'm going to
blend it even more because it's still
quite a harsh line so I'm just gonna go
back and forth to make this all really
blended and now that they are blending
together it's more of a very subtle
greeny gold which is just such an
unusual shade I don't think I've ever
seen a shape like this before so
together they work really beautifully
and they're actually starting to love
this eye shadow color I think I've put a
bit too much green on one I'm just gonna
put a bit more on this one okay and the
next thing I'm going to do is actually
not a new in on first impression but I'm
going to put some bare minerals blemish
remedy powder all over my face just
because not so bad in the camera for
once but in real life I'm going a little
bit shiny this one is one of my
favorites for those days where I feel
like I could be getting a bad skin day
coming because it has those blemish
remedy benefits too it's got some skin
loving ingredients and I really like the
pot as well it's got that sponge and
netting kind of so you don't have a pick
up too much product you don't need to
tap it off too much unless there was
some in the lid originally or you press
too hard like that and I'm just sleeping
that using a zoeva powder brush just
everywhere really so my skin is looking
a little bit more mattifying now but it
hasn't lost that glow completely which I
love about this powder and next what am
I going to do next I think I will share
with you a new eyeliner yes
so this eyeliner is from a brand called
Minah it looks like three eye and a you
might have seen their store popping
a little bit down from Charlotte Tilbury
onk-onk garden or income garden I don't
think it is for our street but it's it's
near there that main one also next to
the kekeke a store so yeah this is the
brand that is that only store in the UK
at the moment and I tried this on my
hand and I'm surprised it's not still
there because it was so sturdy and
long-lasting and I actually said when I
tried it that it was like a calligraphy
pen it was so beautiful to write with so
I'm really looking forward to trying
this on my actual eye so let's give this
a go I've picked up a black shade but
this brand is known for its color there
were there were other shades there there
were pencil liners in beautiful kind of
cobalt sand turquoise but you know me
classic girl I went from the black it's
a really fine knit knit this is a really
fine it nib so I'm going to be able to
get really nice and close to my lashes
my hands are shaking from being poorly
this is really hard well so that is some
intense liner this is very very black I
hate it when you sometimes spend a
little bit less on an eye liner and it
can be gray or a little bit watery and
you have to wait from one layer to dry
and then you go in again whereas this is
black and black on the very first go
which I'm really impressed with
especially the price this is definitely
under ten pounds I think goes either 695
or 895 or something like that so very
good value if I was to click out click
if I was to pick out any negatives I
would say the nib isn't long enough I
actually found that I wanted it to be a
bit longer so that I could hold the pen
a bit further away from my face if that
makes sense
but that's probably me just being a
little bit picky and also compared to
the Tom Ford one where the neighbors a
little bit softer and more flexible it
felt a little bit harder to apply but
for that price and the intensity of that
color and I know the long-lasting nest
from
I had on my hand yesterday so very very
impressed this is called the pen
eyeliner and if you ask for the liquid
one in the MENA store then you will find
it so I'm quickly going to do the other
eye before I move on I know I said I
wasn't going to do brows but I just
realized that I picked up the wire
seller brow in a recent fill unique
order so I thought I would just try this
out for the first time as it is a first
impressions video it's kind of like a
giant version of benefits gimme brow but
more expensive and but I thought I would
buy it to see if it's worth being more
expensive it still has a very small wand
and it's so great too for the brows I'm
hoping it's got some kind of color to it
which it does so I think this is going
to be a really nice brow setting one and
actually I really like the color it's
very similar to my natural brow color
and the bristle because it is bigger
than gimme brow is really coming out the
brows so maybe if you have slightly
bushy eyebrows and this would be a good
one for you it's not too pigmented when
I get it on my skin it's not too obvious
so that's just really helped to neaten
out my brows yeah I would say it's very
similar to gimme brow I think it's not
quite as colored but maybe they look a
little bit neater because I've been able
to just flick it on super quick so yeah
good first impression and now I'm going
to try a new mascara this is the Too
Faced better than sex waterproof mascara
I've heard mixed reviews about this I'm
interested to see what I think of it so
Too Faced better than sex is obviously a
classic mascara very well known and
loved in the beach industry hopefully
this is going to be just a scoop at
waterproof cute packaging it's got like
turquoise droplets on it it's actually
3d droplets which is really nice it
feels quite satisfying to hold and let's
have a look at this brush so you've got
a massive chunky brush just the same as
you would in the normal to Faced better
than sex I have to say it's just very
heavy considering a lot of people will
take this on holiday I think this is
quite
metally tube which is something to
consider because weight restrictions and
all that so I'm actually going to curl
my lashes first because I remember my
Too Faced better than sex isn't the best
at curling the lashes so I'm just using
my tweezer Minh squeezing each lash and
let's go in with mascara so very initial
impressions is that it's coating my
lashes really well I'd say all my top
lashes are already coated I'm just gonna
lightly tap it on the bottom lashes I
don't want too much coverage on the
bottom it looks like a lot more high
gloss than better than sex original
version if that makes sense like these
lashes where they're catching the light
are really quite shiny I guess that's
the waterproof element to them almost a
little bit more plasticky but where I'm
a little bit more cack-handed on this
side it's not separating the lashes
quite so well and I have actually got a
couple of flakes on my face which is not
good just gonna wipe them up that could
be my error though I'm not gonna blame
it on the mascara I'm going to go back
in on that first dye and layer up a
little bit see this eye is going really
well
and I feel like I've almost got a false
lash effect even like as soon as I
started the second coat
I think this file looks great put this
eye where I'm not quite so skilled and
reaching over it's just not going
anywhere near so well it's quite clumpy
the lashes look quite short
it looks like two completely different
mascaras okay I'm gonna stop there but I
feel like yeah that's crazy where I've
done it well and I've been using the
natural movement they're great they're
really wide open really false lash
effect whereas this side I mean they're
not bad but definitely not better than
sex um and they're a little bit clumpy
got hair on my face a little bit clumpy
they don't look too short they don't
look very found out so I guess in any
photo so I'm just gonna post like this
today this one I've been dying to show
you guys for so long it's not actually a
real first impression so I'm used it a
few times but it's the Tom Ford Soleil
contouring compact and look at the
beauty of this palette is so stunning
I'm going to use the blush shade now and
I'm going to take it on the actually is
a first impression because I'm use the
blush shade yeah I've only use the
contour and the highlight so I'm going
to use the blush on these so either Lux
of sheer cheek brush and if I remember
correctly the contour is very very
pigmented so I'm just going to go super
lightly just a couple of swipes and then
I'm using the massive mirror in the lid
as my mirror because my foundation isn't
too heavy it's not going to have such a
pure finish so I'm just going to really
really lightly apply this to the apples
of my cheeks Wow
is so pigmented I look like little dawn
already oh my gosh beware of super
pigmented you're going to use this but
that is the most stunning shade I'm just
gonna blend that up towards my hairline
this is the most beautiful blush shade
well it's a very kind of
dollie looking color really beautiful
quite a matte color as well and just
look at it it's so stunning with a
little TF and blazed on there so
gorgeous last but not least another one
from the Mina brand and this is their
okay I can't see the official name but
it's basically a lip lacquer so it comes
with a doe foot applicator and like this
and it's going to apply liquid but dry
matte and I know that because I put some
on my hand yesterday I've got the shade
503 which is basically my normal shade a
slightly brown pink so I haven't
prepared the lips tool I put lip balm on
maybe about three hours ago this morning
so I'm going to apply this directly onto
my lips it feels very light quite milky
I find some lip stains or lip lipsticks
I find some lips I find some lip
products of this consistency can feel
quite thick when you're putting them on
but this definitely doesn't feel sick at
all it's actually really really lovely
consistency gorgeous color I absolutely
love this shade
considering how light the texture of
this is when you apply it it's actually
very pigmented I accidentally went over
my lip line and it was very obvious it
wasn't like a washed out color it was
very obvious that I'd gone over the lip
line so maybe next time I'll apply this
with a lip liner I finished applying
that about five seconds ago and it's
already almost dry so I'm going to go in
with a second coat hopefully it won't
budge the original color really really
pleased with that I think that's the
gorgeous color and the apps in love have
applied hopefully you can see the color
in the camera but it's not too
dissimilar to my normal shade feels so
comfortable on the lips I honestly don't
feel like I'm wearing anything it's not
fully dry yet but by the time I finish
crumbling it probably will be this again
I think was such a super price
definitely less than ten pounds I will
again insert here if I can find it
otherwise I'll leave the links to
everything down below and to be honest I
think that is everything I did have a
couple of other bits and bobs but
they're not going to work based on what
I've already put on my face so I will do
those on snapchat now so hopefully you
guys find this video interesting and I
feel like I chose not kind of the usual
brands if that makes sense so hopefully
maybe you've discovered some new brands
or thought about some products that
maybe you wouldn't have considered
before and yeah that was the idea of the
video this is kind of what I do on a
regular basis on the weekends maybe you
saw in my spring morning routine I got
out that box and I said that and one
thing
because it's travel a new beauty
products so doing something like this
just showing new stuff on my face is
quite a regular thing for me to do and I
do snapchatted quite a lot so make sure
you're following on sanchow if you like
this kind of thing um so yes I need to
get packing now because I'm heading off
in a few hours so I hope you're enjoying
my holiday vlogs this one will be
inserted somewhere between holiday vlogs
and yes I hope you're all really well
and give this video a thumbs up if you
liked it and I'll see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
