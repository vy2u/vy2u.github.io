joining me for today's video it is my
new in November beauty video so I
haven't sat down and just spoke to the
camera in quite some time my last few
videos have been either vlogs or out in
about style videos so hopefully I'm not
too rusty I think it's been about three
weeks since I had this little camera
setup and we just had a little chat like
this but on the plus side today's video
is a really fun one there are so many
amazing products that come out either at
the end of October or the beginning of
November
I think the friends are starting to
launch their christmas products and
speaking of which I actually have a
really fun giveaway for an amazing
Beauty advent calendar at the end of
this video so make sure you stick around
to find out all about that one so we're
gonna start with the budget products and
then I'm going to make my way up to more
of the high end and the first two things
I want to talk to you about are these
two new mascara from a collection so I
was really lucky to be invited to a
photo shoot that collection we're doing
for the spring/summer campaign but these
are actually in shops now this is their
divine waterproof lash mascara and also
a volume also divine and divine volume
lash mascara I think the packaging of
these two is really cute they've got
like a clear and knit I think when it
comes to drugstore mascaras you cannot
beat collection the brushes on these are
the kind of brushes that you'd expect to
find on a high-end mascara that is very
stiff bristled ones which I find are
really good at wiggling between the
lashes to really separate them out
that's what the volume lash and the same
for the divine lash again it's the kind
of brush you would expect to see on more
expensive mascaras really stiff so you
have great for creating that separation
and I think these are like definitely
less than five pounds each so really
good new drugstore mascara on chest
sorry em have also added to their
daylight curing nail varnish range I
absolutely love this range they last so
long on the nails and you don't need any
top coat or anything to cure these
they've added a couple of new colors
I've picked out my favorites which are
these two here first one is this almost
lilac II taupe color and it's called
dark side of the shroom so I guess it's
some kind of a mushroom II shade but
more of a purple and again with the
packaging rose gold lid these are
absolutely beautiful and then also a
classic or tunnel whiny color and this
is number three no five three six
vengeance is wine and again just a
classic autumnal color beautiful
packaging and if you get the daylight
curing top coat which you need in order
to make these really long lasting these
are actually really hard to find so make
sure you have little rummage in the
drawers in familias boots and Superdrug
to find them and if you do find them
maybe grab a couple because I can never
seem to find these when I go into the
stores and but yeah lovely new shades
for bury em bury em I've also pull out a
load of new lipsticks as part of their
autumn range and I chose these two which
are 169 and 168 both of which are kind
of a muted Pink's I'm really loving that
almost brown pinky shade at the moment
and these two are absolute stunning
I just dropped this one on my lap and
I'll have it all over the bed sheets and
all over my leggings but it's really
really beautiful and this is the color
I'm wearing today this is one six nine
formulas they kind of come out as a
mixture between matte and shiny
they're definitely quite moisturizing on
the lips but I wouldn't say that they're
a full gloss finish but they do tend to
leave a nice stain on the lips as well
so you can have a really lovely
long-lasting color with this one's from
area this time of year as well they also
always bring out new glitter pots and I
picked up the gold and the white so I
can do some really lovely kind of
coppery eyeshadow tutorials maybe
but yeah I think these are really lovely
tubbing your makeup kit when it comes to
the festive time of year these are also
newing from Berrien and then lastly from
berry and they've brought out a load of
lovely new pallets part of their autumn
winter range I've chosen these
supernatural eyeshadow palette and this
is a super drug limited edition inside
the shades are very reminiscent of a
certain and they give three pallets but
they basically range from the brow bone
shades here and almost cream you've got
some shimmery Pink's here and the matte
pink which is great for a lid color and
then going all the way down into some
shimmery Brown such an absolute gorgeous
if the Naked palette is out of your
budget then this is a really super
alternative and the packaging is really
gorgeous as well I definitely think this
is going to be a popular stocking filler
this yeah another palette which is
really gorgeous and I think that this
brand is so underrated
it's the pixi by petra book of beauty
contour kit palette so this has got some
beautiful shades in it loads of
different colors for creating the
perfect contour so whether you want to
have other lighter shade for
highlighting all the way down to really
deep shades or very dramatic contour
this little palette has but all you need
and this brand absolutely love I've got
this brand so long not many people have
actually heard of it but I feel like I'm
going about pixi quite a lot over on the
blog and YouTube channel and this is
just a gorgeous kit so if you haven't
heard of pixie or if maybe friends
haven't been definitely something from
pixie can make a lovely stocking filler
this is a really cute one for this time
of year as well it's the push rate der
riese which i think is rose powder from
Bourjois and it's basically a little pot
of slightly shimmering powder and I
think this is gonna be really lovely for
party season when you're wearing some
lower cut items make you want to give
shimmer on your neck bone neck bone is
that a thing collarbone
perhaps I'm looking for and on
cheekbones it's just
very subtle shimmer thing can be really
lovely for just a bit of highlight to
the body as well as the face so this is
a new one from Bourjois
and there are few more things from the
drugstore idea before tout an incredible
range of new lashes for the party season
I'm gonna start off with these ones
these are actually part of their party
range and I've got the snow princess
lashes you might remember a little while
ago I wore them in a color run blog that
I did but now these are available in
store and perfect for the past season
these ones have got a lovely bit of
glitter in the lashes but nothing too
crazy so if you just want to add a
little bit of sparkle something a bit
extra special to makeup look then these
are accent gorgeous but if you want to
stick with more neutral lashes and they
absolutely love these new box sets which
they port out they have really cute
packaging it's a little velcro dot here
and it just opens up like a wardrobe to
reveal all of these lashes so you've got
from very natural to really big old
lashes down at the bottom
I think these are gorgeous stocking
fillers lovely little treats made for
Secret Santa and yeah I think basically
all the old festive party season that
lashes are catered for in these little
sets another new release with the party
season in mind is the bear real mascara
from benefit and this mascara has been
out for quite a while but this is a new
addition and it has Swarovski crystals
in the lid so I'm gonna show you this
cuz it's so beautiful so we have the
normal they're real mascara but the
packaging is matte black which is just
so chic and as you can see the lid has
these gorgeous swarovski crystals on it
so i mean it's just a lovely addition to
your makeup kit if you'd like to collect
little limited edition pieces like this
but also if you know a beauty lover who
is obsessed with their real mascara then
this is just such a perfect gift idea i
know i keep mentioning gift ideas i'm
going to be putting together a load of
christmas gift guides by the way which
are going to be on the youtube channel
next week so if you do want loads more
gift ideas and definitely come
his videos out but yeah this one from
benefit I can imagine it's gonna be in
lots of stockings and lots of wish lists
this Christmas is so damn pretty some
products which are a little bit more
relaxed staying a little bit more
chilled and not so much on the beauty
side are some new launches from origins
I absolutely love origins if you watched
my videos for a while or on my blog for
a while you know that I absolutely love
this brand and these two new launches
are all about just taking a little bit
of me time having a little bit more time
to relax and pamper yourself so this is
their feel-good candle and the scent is
really really lovely for this time of
year it's got pine spruce and orange in
it so as you can imagine it's a lovely
and festive so definitely enhanced when
lit down in the lounge when playing the
Christmas tree oh it's just a lovely
fragrance but quite unisex as well so if
you've got a guy in the house then he's
not gonna be worried about being too
sweet or too girly and the packaging
almost reminds me of like a wine bottle
so I used to be so obsessed with those
candles that look like wine bottles and
yeah it's just a really lovely very
relaxing very homely fragrance
another one which is perfect for a
pamper evening is their new comfort mood
whipped vanilla body souffle now body
souffles are just the most luxurious
things in the whole wide world
and vanilla has got to one of my
favorite fragrances especially for
slobbering all over my body in the
winter after a nice hot bath and this
just combines those two things you can
see it's really thick almost kind of
looks like icing sugar and it smells so
heavenly so if you want to treat
yourself or treat somebody out again
lovely stocking for the idea this is
just such a scrumptious pampering
products that always is gonna feel
so lovely and luxurious when you use
them sorry if I'm rushing through I just
have certain products and I want to tell
you about so the next thing is the new
eyeshadow palette from Urban Decay and
this is part of their collaboration with
Gwen Stefani so Gwen Stefani worked with
Urban Decay with everything from the
packaging to the products so as you can
imagine it's very kind of record and
music inspired packaging this almost
looks like a kind of CD case and then
inside you have the most incredible
range of eyeshadows you can really tell
this is kind of been designed with a pop
princess in mind but you've also got
some crazy shades in there as well so if
you wanted to do something a little bit
more dramatic you've got bright blue a
bright pink a beautiful gold but then
the very wearable Browns and blacks in
there as well so I think this is going
to make a lovely present for a music
lover or a makeup lover a collectibles
lover it's just got so many beautiful
colors inside there's also some new
releases from Elizabeth Arden just in
time for the festive season and it's
their beautiful color highlighter and
beautiful color eye shadow quad the
packaging on these again is so stunning
it's almost like a baroque black and
gold or black golden green very I don't
know I always want to say medieval but
the packaging is just beautiful for the
ears inside the products absolutely
gorgeous as well so this highlighter has
got three different shades I guess you
can swirl your brush around for all of
them or just use even your fingers to
add a little bit of highlights the
cheekbone area or you can even use a
small brush users eye shadow as I have
done
this one if you are looking for a new
eyeshadow their beautiful color
eyeshadow quad is absolute gorgeous
again with the stunning packaging and
beautiful little eyeshadow shapes inside
you've got some very wearable Browns and
then a nice pink which is really lovely
again for the brow bone of gold which is
perfect for the festive season and then
you've got like a deep green and moody
color as well which is quite unusual I
can't even tell you the last time I wore
emerald on my eyes but I think it's
going to be a very opulent makeup look
if you add emerald and green I think
that's just three a really beautiful
look for the party season the next
product is not really a new in but more
like a relaunch and this is so hi
anticipated and it's the nyan Clarins
instant light lip comforting oils now so
many people really wanted to get their
hands on these when they came out
originally at the beginning of the year
but they sold out so quickly especially
the pink shade but Clarins have bought
them back into the collection just in
time for Christmas and the exciting part
is they are now part of the permanent
collection so these as you can probably
guess by the names are oils for your
lips and I don't think that any other
brand that I've come across has done
this kind of product before the shades
are honey and raspberry both of which
both of which smell and taste absolutely
heavenly so if you find your lips get
chapped in winter but you don't want to
have almost the dryness of a bomb then
these are just so stunning from really
bringing lots of nourishment and
moisture back into your lips they're not
sticky in the slightest I thought an oil
on my leather some really sticky if you
can imagine and
doesn't make your hair sticky it just
makes your hair lovely and glossy and
healthy looking and feeling and that's
pretty much what these oils do to the
lips they're just so lovely the scents
are absolutely incredible so nice and
it's not a thick do people like you
might think it's very fine luxurious
quite a thin oil but definitely has a
thickness to stay in place for a good
length of time on the lips and then
finally last but absolutely not least I
have some beautiful festive launches
from Burberry beauty I never really
tried that much berry Beauty before but
if this is anything to go by then the
whole collection is just absolutely
stunning
so the first product is there news
radiance fresh balloonists fluid base
comes in this gorgeous gold box and this
looks tiny but actually it is a
ginormous bottle of a very lumen ating
highlighter which you apply all over
your face as a base before you put on
your foundation so kind of similar to
the back product obviously it's Burberry
so it's a little bit more luxurious and
became beautiful beautiful stocking
filler or the main presence and at your
wishlist if you don't normally treat
yourself to make of those quite as
pricey or such areas as Burberry as you
can see the packaging is so classic and
beautiful and from what I've tried from
very beauty's so far it's gonna be an
absolutely fabulous product I think
really great again if you want to just
create that very natural-looking lip
from within glow if you're autumn winter
makeup look and great for the party
season everybody wants to have a little
bit of shimmer on their complexion and
that can also be added on with the new
eyeshadow this is the eye color cream in
festive gold are going absolutely
gorgeous packaging you can see the
Burberry stripes on the lid there it's a
lovely glass square with this gorgeous
light gold shadow inside so the shadow
doesn't come off as a very intense color
so I think this is the kind of product
that I'll be using over the top of an
existing eyeshadow is really nice to Pat
on the finger and then just Pat over
your eyeshadow when you complete - the
look - a little bit of shimmer to any
eye makeup look again amazing for the
festive season and just such a beautiful
packaging and finally we have the
Burberry kisses hydrating lip color in
the shade for festive gold again is a
gold lipstick which doesn't sound like
the most wearable product but it's the
kind of thing again you can pop over any
lipstick if you have a matte red or a
matte plum shade and you just want to
add a little bit of shimmer to your
looks make it more suitable for
Christmas parties or in the evening then
this is a super one that it has the
really satisfying magnetic closure which
one I can get it right it's just so so
beautiful the packaging is stunning
product inside a very very wearable
piece it's just a very unusual piece as
well so if you if you've got someone on
your Christmas list which kind of has
everything then you can guarantee they
won't have anything like this and they
make a book
so beautiful final product from the
Burberry Christmas collection so that's
all the new in products that I have to
