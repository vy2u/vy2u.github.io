can see I have a special guest with me
today is the lovely Sabrina from a
little obsessed whose videos I
absolutely love so thank you for coming
Michael and Sabrina and I today are
going to do some new in beauty products
we're going to go through some of our
favorites new in budget products and
also over on Sabrina's channel what you
film a high-end new in as well yes so
definitely go and watch that one
straight after this I will link
everything down below so I think as you
are the guest you should go back what we
start with oh my gosh modeling it as we
speak
and so batiste have launched some new
hair products rather than just dry
shampoo I actually fought these with dry
shampoo but they're not no he's so it's
slightly different packaging so I
thought oh yeah have two bottles of
direction on feel at home I'm gonna use
some and then I put some heat protectant
in and it's definitely not dry shampoo
but I really think of a base of things
the same thing so this one's a heated
shine spray and this one's a frizz tamer
and they're really fine mist just like
you would get with dry shampoo which
whatever you like I think they're pretty
affordable and well that's all good
stuff
the usual yeah so my first new in budget
product is a new perfume from Avon and
this is the Avon attraction fragrance a
couple of nights ago Spreen and I we
were invited by Avon to Donson wah which
is basically a restaurant where you eat
in the pitch black wasn't it such a
crazy experience which is expensive to
be dim yeah but it was just the black I
haven't been in like such a dog for uno
buy even at night time we were saying
even when you are going to bet there's
still a streetlight
or if you live in the countryside you
still get car lights but there was just
nothing like it was absolute blackness I
actually was a few of these restaurants
worldwide in Amenas one in Paris but I
can't behind percentual yeah and
basically all the other gentleman that
was serving us he was blind so he was
obviously like used to doing things I
don't see anything and was all about the
senses which I guess is why eggwin chose
it for their fragrance launch and then
you perfumes
got one for men and wonderful women I'll
just get out of packaging it's pretty
lovely bottle so this is the bottle it's
a really lovely gold color and it's
quite a strange shape it's almost like
an inverted cheese grater that's a
really weird way of describing perfume
and so basically there's a women's
fragrance and men's fragrance and they
both slot together perfectly but the
really interesting thing is that you can
wear the women's all the men's and the
men's can the men can wear the women's
or men's as well so they're both very
unisex fragrances I prefer the women's
on me but I think definitely on no I
prefer the Mazie oh yeah that's really
funny she said that some people just
prefer the opposite sex but both of them
are lovely fragrances and the best thing
is they are 15 pounds which I cannot
believe less crazy feeling crazy and
they're made in the same factories as
did they say that Chanel number 5
Jumanji so really incredible product and
15 pounds so I'm really really impressed
with the new eyePHONE fragrances so next
I brought the new I law and flirt of
false lashes which I actually haven't
tried but you've gotten right now I'm
wearing these ones right now and I
absolutely love them yeah I actually
think they're really pretty
I'm not hundred percent sure how many
sets there are do you know I think there
might be one more because there's a
light green one which is a three quarter
lashes yeah but you're pretty nice so
you definitely need to get those but I
think they're just so pretty because I
think that just come often be like
really over the top but this they aren't
at all and they just see my reading
somewhere why are eating like Fleur so I
just think it's like a nice like product
to buy really and I don't know she's
always excellent and then blues good
well that sort of stuff and they have
some single lashes here outside and I
think that quite easy to apply and then
which one should you say you have one
these ones you have one simply flap so
just thing up really pretty
everyday ones really nice ones and then
flow or fabulous if you want something a
little bit more but I don't think
they're too like dry mummy or anything
like that just not too dramatic because
that you have same to the other day we
like to remember the days when you used
to put on false
and you could feel that they were there
has to be always like adjusting them but
now and especially with these because I
always trim them so they like the
righthand so I know I have to take off
like three millimeters you just forget
that you're wearing them the badge just
really really fit as well you know
everyone yeah not too much I mean you
can't even see and stuff so it's just
perfect yeah lovely and the next thing
that I've got to talk about there's
actually like a whole range of product
sitting in front of me because this
morning I was shopping with Becca and
Vernon - hm and we'd both spotted the
HLN Beauty Collection on other people's
instagrams and we both knew we wanted to
be known for it so I have pretty but not
the whole collection where I have a
large selection in front of me so it's
going to show a few little bits and bobs
so firstly let's talk about the
packaging it's so beautiful most of it
is all like black and white and gold and
main themes then omana shares which
Sabrina is holding they have a humungous
shade range they have so many but I
picked up some kind of well I think you
could wear these in the springtime but I
thought they were like oh yeah it's got
like a brown pink lilac and then there's
kind of like all of the color which has
real basic unusual yeah how much it
works it's tape I'm surely one huge
everyone know the price as well I think
I'm at 399 I took them all out the box
is so noisy oh yeah yeah so the nail
varnishes was 399 each which is I mean
really like standard for but you know
yeah this is considering the shades like
yeah please for me I'm packaging
gorgeous but the packaging for the
palettes was what I loved the most I can
tell I'm gonna get really OCD about
getting like dust and fingerprints
already trying to wipe it down but the
packaging I'm not sure Milan Saders but
really reminds me of Tom Ford especially
the ones that are the white with the
hole you know I just think this looks
really kind of Tom forty very very
high-end and looks especially
considering the price I just think
they're all absolutely gorgeous this is
the perfectionist finishing powder I
haven't tried this yet apart from
swatching on the back of my hand and I
really liked it from the swatch so I'm
replaying around with this one later is
there a lot of shade there was about
five shades all right
yeah so if it was the foundation version
this is just the finishing powder but
the foundation versions they had a lot
more it's a really good shade range if
you can normally struggle I think
sometimes budgets like three different
shades first since five is pretty good
they had loads of shades of things like
blushes so this is the cream blusher I
got the shades color isn't it I got
cameo Brown pure velvet cream blusher I
mean the packaging in Instagram pictures
are just gonna look amazing I got
another Brown blusher but the powder
version this is deep brown pure radiance
powder blushes I think this is a lovely
autumnal color as well then we've got
the eye shadow palette there was loads
of different colors of eyeshadow
palettes as well maybe like three or
four different eyeshadow palettes but I
got the brownie one here which is called
the smokey news and again yeah of course
that was $9.99 and you've got how many
what it's about nine nine colors and all
I'd say really usable colors it's a nice
mattes
it's a nice yes nice kind of like Naked
3 and 4 in 1 and then the lipsticks I've
got a couple of lipsticks ago couldn't
decide which color don't actually
remember grabbing two but we have two so
that we're going to go with it
I've got peach fuzz and kombucha
kombucha okay but yeah some lovely
autumnal lip colors again beautiful
packaging pink and pink and gold golden
white which is gorgeous it doesn't look
like them
and then I also bought three of the
eyeshadows we've got a couple of
different brown shades a mixture of
matte and what's in the word sparkly
this is an eyeshadow cream I kind of got
this because I wanted to compare it to
Charlotte Tilbury and see if it was
similar but for a fraction of the price
again beautiful packaging then we've got
a get-a-grip dry hairspray good handbag
size I've got a cashmere body wash I
just thought I'd try out the body range
I've never tried any agent and body
range before and it looks really pretty
but I had something that came in a black
also you know yes I wanted to get
the body lotion I wanted to get
something in that pack
but they didn't have like hand wash
forgot what hand wash would have been a
body wash and gentle cleanse out with
jasmine flower extract and it's so
pretty she has smell herself that like
the kind of font installer just
beautiful about actually not crazy about
it no it smells like I know you kind of
like washing powder or something but
maybe it's more different when we use it
yeah what's in it Jasmine jasmine flower
extract don't even you it doesn't in the
spotlight but it doesn't taste like it's
not so detergent yeah interesting we'll
let you know how it smells on the body
because we're not sold at the moment so
come back to that one but overall
absolutely love the hmm Beauty range the
new packaging is absolute gorgeous and
I'm sorry in advance to all the
Instagram spammers that this is going to
run of course I tried the previous
section and footage is actually and I
really really loved them because I was
like yeah of course he was excellently
last show ever
so I'm hoping that these will be quite
good as well surely they're gonna make
many words know when it's not that
either that's a good sign so I didn't
actually bring the whole range with me
just because it was pretty heavy but the
body shop have got a spy of the world
range and I just think it's a nice a
Cygnus range because it's just so
affordable this is huge yeah that's
massive and they have it they have a few
other big pots to have a scrub a body
wash all that sort of stuff
this one's the scrub so greeny yeah I
haven't tried no been raining they smell
nice yeah oh my gosh I think that'd be
really nice like if you know when you
come back from living your tongues
really packed and you just like want to
get rid of it because it's got a mega
big grass just such a huge blow I think
it's quite luxe as well yeah I think it
looks like a nobody like watch it Brad I
guess what if shop isn't really that
cheap I'm still assuming neither
probably like High Street on yeah I
don't think so you can't get them in
Boots buy something they're quiet like a
high tree but I don't know what to do
with them I think kind of going out to
say to me I know you say I think that
I've got quite a few we're friends all
my friends enough I think
something you typically buy in like
super drugs'll news but actually the
product I'm most excited about is the
charcoal body clay just cuz I think it's
just so nice or so babyish no it's a
face book it's a mask for your body's
body eyes actually send me a photo we're
doing it
se Boston I just think it's a really fun
like product I haven't tried any body
masks and I'm trailer in force trying
this oh my god yeah I'm not really sure
where I apply it they're like just all
over my body so I just stand there and
wait for it is crispy like I think it is
I'm pretty sure it does done that's
still yeah where do you kind of have
where do you kinda need purifying how
long do you what do you do for 10
minutes while your body mask is shining
you can't like go in I guess people just
relax don't may I call you say face 10
minute you couldn't use it in the in the
bar yes I don't know by YouTube maybe
you would maybe you don't have to stay
completely still and you put it on and
then do your like deep conditioner or
something yeah I'm not a shower person
so I don't know what make your face
master intrigue calm so the next one
that I've got is another product which
launched very recently Sabrina and I
were investigating the launch of this
which was at the what's it called
electric cinema electric cinema in
Notting Hill and L'Oreal basically took
over the whole cinema I've never been in
there normally but it's got like sofas
at the beginning at the front row they
made it all beautiful and pink lighting
in there and lovely bunches of flowers
on the seats that really absolutely
gorgeous launch and it was all for the
new color
reach collection exclusive lipsticks and
every year or maybe every couple of
every year every year they bring out a
super range of lipsticks previously it
has been the nude range or the red range
and this year it's all about the pinks
so absolutely perfect for me because
obviously I love pink lippy and they're
all inspired by iconic ladies
so we've got the Naomi the Blake the
Helen who's Helen I'm sorry Helen but we
don't know who you are and either who
you go I have the same as you've got a
loss for ones in my house somewhere
Eva Helen and Blake you've lost Naomi
yeah I think that's the nicest one
actually it's like more yeah what means
I think they're all really nice the only
chefs not really metal cutter but the
only one I don't like it's Helen no
every time we don't really know oh you
showed that I'd be nice to be new I mean
oh is it bone though they're supposed to
have a little bit of shimmer in there
although them shimmer I don't know if
it's really shimmer it has notes that
matte lipsticks I think with some sort
of shimmer in them and I also really
love the shape of the political mm yeah
because they're very I'm gonna do a
little closer but they're very pointy at
the top so I've become really obsessive
lipliner recently I'm just loving the
definition that it gives but these have
got a very sharp point at the nib which
is really great for application without
a lip liner I'll actually just smelling
them and they smell like like mums
lipstick yeah that's quite an odd split
yeah yeah I think it's quite like mmm
comforting and the packaging is very
chic yeah definitely so then I've got
two more lip products from drugstore
these these are new provoker lips from
Rimmel these new shades I've never tried
them is so good I've got one in those
drawers over so imagine because it just
lived in my handbag but you don't need
to top them up ever that's so good but
that scares me so if it they're gonna be
really drying mmm they've probably
improved the formula since last year if
they're bringing them out again I didn't
find it mega dry like I found these the
Foro ones and more drying
but yeah so do you put these on and then
top it up with this yeah and this is
moisturizing so if you are in the mid of
day like oh and one more moisture then
you can just put another layer of this
but the colleges studies yeah these two
are new colors this one is not guilty
this one where did you see it just then
pick underneath your finger very
seductive they're really affordable in
that like five pounds yeah yeah yeah and
then might last from you in budget
Beauty goodies although they're not
huger budget but again still on the high
street are the new beach range from
oliver boners and as far as i'm aware of
the bonus only really used to have hand
creams i didn't realize the hair to the
full range so now they have more hand
creams this is a hand and nail cream and
it's the indian Pomerleau and which
listing packaging it's so gorgeous so
appreciate I'm just saying like this is
really really lovely it's got the whole
path still looks very luxe you know the
luxe hand cream brands that have this
whole like solar thing and just I think
that absolutely beautiful then they've
also got the prick rating or priming
praline and cream lip balm which again
really beautiful packaging and there's
quite a lot of product and yeah
sometimes with more kind of high-end
high street they just skimp you on this
one comes in the most adorable packaging
it's an elderflower fears bath bomb I
believe I'm just gonna check like all
that right bath marbles so I'm really
intrigued to see what this is gonna be
like I think judging by the packaging my
froggies gonna be like loads of mini
bath bombs but I'm really looking
forward to getting the best I go that's
nice idea like I always feel a bit
wasteful throwing like a whole massive
woman so I guess like it's once quite
nice and I'm assuming this is for
Christmas I guess and I don't think it's
that like - Christmas card list of
things I'm very pretty and girly you
could give it as like a girlfriend yeah
it's definitely my gift packaging I
definitely man myself but I always put
other stuff in the bathroom bathrooms
anyway yeah so you could just put your
oil in and then stick a couple of these
in just for the fun of having a bath
furs yeah and there's also a blackberry
and a blackberry musk rollerball
fragrance I find rollerball fragrances
so good for keeping in a handbag because
they're just a lot smaller and even
though you roll them on you put them on
your pulse points and I find that the
smell
is really strong with rollerball
products so blackberry musk sounds
really nice I don't realize that my mask
is actually part of like a deer animal
no actually I love musky sense like
they're my favorite it was part of like
that glance or something I don't know I
did this thing with them florists where
I met the perfumer he was like yeah as
long as I'm not artificial but real musk
is from ideas I'm on my foot from a tree
or fact it that's nothing more natural
than deer let's get quite natural but
just a bit quite unisex actually yeah I
think mas usually can mm-hmm
BlackBerry's quite sweet no that's nice
I know that makes me want a cocktail
oh yeah it actually does it is like a
daiquiri do they comment to make how
many bigger sizes as well we just wrote
I'm not sure actually but if they do and
that is it that is all of our new in
budget beauty obviously there are so
many budget peach things at the moment
but we painstakingly chose our favorite
for didn't we so hopefully you've
