you're having a lovely week so far thank
you for joining me for kind of part two
of my big fairy new in videos I did part
one on Sunday and I shared with you and
load of my new favorite relaunches from
the drugstore so bits and bobs you can
find boots and Superdrug all those kind
of places so if you are a lover of
drugstore beauty then definitely check
out that video after this one today's
video is going to be more along the
lines of high-end and luxury products
this month there have been so many
incredible launches so which I found out
about a little while ago and I've been
dying to show you and some of them I
have only just found out about and I'm
really really excited and yeah I thought
I would share with you just a few of my
favorites not every single new launch
because that would be a 10 hour long
video if not more but just cherry pick a
few of my absolute favorites so the
first two products I wanted to talk to
you about are these two from Karen's now
currants you probably saw spamming your
snapchat your Instagram your Twitter and
even vlogs you probably saw that
currants took over Mondrian and sketch
last week or the week before to launch
these two moisturizers as part of their
new multi active range and the event was
just incredible they've put so much
effort into it honestly I think I have
to say the best blogging about that I've
ever been to and that really is saying
something because brands do you go to
crazy extremes these days and so
basically is to launch these two
moisturizers you have a morning
moisturizer or a day cream and a night
moisturizer so this one is multi active
sure and this one is multi active neat I
sadly was flight to Scotland when they
did the proper talk about the products
so my knowledge may not be as detailed
as someone who was at that talk but I'm
just gonna tell you what I think of them
so I did learn is that both of these
have been inspired by botanical research
so parents have spent a long long time
researching botanics so basically plants
and I guess that was kind of the reason
why
that was so beautiful and floral and
they've taken a new ingredient I'm not
sure the name of it or I do know it but
I can't pronounce it so I'm listening
I'll put it down the bottom of the
screen there but basically it works to
target fine lines but at a very early
stage so when you're probably in their
20s and 30s and if you live in a city
like me or wherever you live the Sun UV
everything it's it's slowly starting to
build those fine lines into your skin
and this helps to really protect your
skin against them so it's kind of
prevention is better than cure because
it's a moisturizer as you might expect
it's obviously really hydrating and well
it also love about this is its SPF 20 I
find that it's very quickly absorbed
which is great for a morning cream
because who has the time in the morning
to really like wait 10 15 minutes some
moisturizers are sinking so it's great
that it's really quickly absorbed my
skin is nice and smooth nice and radiant
and hydrated all day long and it's got a
lovely very very subtle scent to it as
well it's not completely fragrant free
fragrance free but just a very very
light quite quite Clarence you smell
nothing too crazy but really beautiful
scent whereas this I have been using
this as my night cream for the past week
or so now although I didn't take it to
Scotland with me so I missed out a
couple of days again targets fine lines
and wrinkles and the early stages of
those again has that lovely scent and I
just find that this is a very
neutralizing night cream so I don't wake
up with oily skin I don't wake up with
dry skin I just find that when I wake up
I'm having a good regular skin day so
long-term effects I can't comment on how
much I get for that long but short-term
effects I really like how I wake up when
I use this at nighttime so a little bit
more expensive than curtains but another
skin care launch is this and it's the
Renaissance bright light spot serum dark
spot serum from Ostia now I've only got
to a factory sample here so this is not
the final packaging but on the note of
packaging I just love the little
osteoclast bottles that thing is so
beautiful they look incredibly luxurious
on the dressing-table and this one has a
very special pipette so it doesn't drip
when you when you pull it out of the tub
so yeah you don't waste any serum
it's not messy so they've really
innovated their pet system there which
is wonderful so they have a back story
about Ostia the founder Georgie used to
suffer really badly from melasma on her
face and her father was probably until
it went wrong but he worked with horses
or he found an ingredient that really
cured a problem with horses hooves
something along those lines but
basically they discovered that MSM is an
incredible ingredient which is really
powerful at healing so Georgie and
humongous team of scientists they worked
for a really long time to develop the
oski range and you guys are only raving
about the Renaissance cleansing jar
before but this is the new one which
specifically targets dark spots and what
it does is it helps to regulate out and
minimize the melanin production in your
skin so basically it helps the skin to
really even out the melanin production
so it doesn't focus all in one place
which is how you get dark spots there
are so many incredible ingredients in
this I seem to remember off the top of
my head like passionfruit and great and
there's loads more which give it the
most incredible fragrance so while I
can't comment on again the long-term
benefits of this and I only have one
dark spot and it's not even that obvious
but I have but I haven't been using it
long enough to really tell you if it
works on that what I can tell you is
that it feels incredibly luxurious to
use I've been using this in the mornings
and the evenings and just is such a
treat to apply the texture it's so silky
and soft even my hands feel like they've
been having a lovely treatment while
I've been using it my face just the
complexion is real even really radiant
and the smell is gorgeous it is 85
pounds so I will definitely be keeping
you updated on how I get along with this
weather it does reduce my dark spots
George I think it said really helped to
produce her dark spots in two weeks so I
need to just stick at this a little bit
longer and I will let you know because I
know it's quite pricey so definitely
want to give you a good update on this
and speaking of things which smell
amazing I have a new body lotion from
Erin and this is their rose de Grasse
I'm sure there's probably like a lovely
French red saying that that was the
class oh that was really bad accent um
but yet so Estee Lauder is the mummy
company of Aaron Aaron I think maybe she
was Estee Lauder's younger sister I
think something along those lines but
basically rose de Grasse is a new
fragrance so they fought out a perfume I
think that's like a soap but I've got
the body lotion which is amazing if you
maybe don't want to splash out fully on
the perfume which I believe is around
135 pound mark so very very pricey but
I'm sure absolutely worth it because
this fragrance I'm gonna throw it out
that I think is my favorite scent I've
ever put on my body ever in the history
of the entire universe I can't quite
find the words to sum it up but you know
sometimes Rose can smell a little bit
old ladyish this just there's just
something about this which is so
expensive and smelling and smells like
you just put diamond roses all over your
body it's still sweet and really girly
that's still really mature as well as
it's incredibly hard to describe but I'm
sorry I lied to you it's not I'm pretty
new to the body wash and this is just
honestly the most heavily scented
product I think I've ever smelt
packaging is beautiful it's Erin it's
very chic it's got the gold and the pink
writing and yes this is very quickly
gone to the very top of my bathing
favorites very last non makeup thing
that I'm going to mention is this and
it's a new face mask from Bobbi Brown so
Bobbi Brown is one of these brands that
they don't like too they don't like to
bring anything to market until they've
absolutely perfected it and you can
really see that within the new face mask
so there are three in total and the one
that I've been trying out recently is
the radiant boost one so I've used this
a couple of times and what it does as
you can guess by the name as it really
helps to kind of exfoliate I guess it is
an exfoliating mask because it has
walnut granules in it so you apply it as
a scrub and then you kind of leave it
there for it says five minutes I think
two to five minutes but I need on five
ten fifteen minutes
yeah doesn't hurt so this not only has
the ingredients of the walnut which
actually scrub away but then it has
things like orange oil which make it
smell really amazing and feel really
luxurious to use and love the packaging
is one of these metal tubes a bit like
the ESOP ones and because it's bubbly
Brown and because they've only bought
out three masks you know that one of the
three is going to be suitable for ever
skin concern or whatever need you are
looking to restocking forwards here
whatever need you're looking to satisfy
does that make sense yeah I think so so
this I would sum up as the kind of face
masks that you reach for when there's a
one-off occasion that you really just
want to have a good skin day save
wedding coming up or a day when you're
gonna be doing lots of photos or really
important meeting I don't know if you
just want your skin to looking really
fresh really radiant not shiny because
I'm sure there's an ingredient in this
which also helps to regulate the skin so
you don't have too much oil production
basically good skin date in a tube the
next two products that I want to show
you are quite probably the most
beautiful beauty products I have ever
laid my eyes upon and it is these two
gorgeous little items from the new
gallon and meteorites range so I'm gonna
start by telling you about this and this
is the meteorites base so basically you
have all these beautiful little pearly
rosy pearls and which get crushed but
when you pump the pump into your hand
and it's a beautiful very soft texture
apply it onto your face before you plan
your makeup and it gives your skin just
basically an incredible head start for
having a flawless base all day no matter
what foundation I try with this I find
that my makeup doesn't get shiny doesn't
get greasy doesn't go anywhere and I
still have a really lovely glow which I
think it's so so so hard to find either
you're ready Matt well you're a shiny or
your skin just doesn't look good by four
o'clock in the afternoon but I did this
makeup at about nine o'clock today and
it's currently 5 o'clock and I haven't
had to top up all I've done in the first
video is add a little bit
so really impressed with this it's not
sheep I believe it's around the 50 pound
mark possibly a teeny bit less depending
on where you shop from so I definitely
wanted to give this pretty good testing
out before I told you about it I will be
doing something on the blog about this
just even more once I've tried it and
got it even more into my daily routine
because when you're switching around
your skincare you never really are too
short which product it is that's giving
you a good skin day but every time I use
this I've just pronounced Lee in love
with the way that it goes on the skin it
has a really lovely texture a really
kind of soft focus and I mean look at it
it's so pretty
and if you are a lover of that lovely
glowing fresh-faced complexion then you
will also love this another stunning
beauty product from Gil and it's got
this gorgeous kind of silver flower
detail on the top and I think that's
because they use Rose Center folio
within the products I'm not sure that it
don't quote me on that one but I have a
feeling that might be why they've got
the beautiful rose inside the beautiful
packaging you've got this incredible
maze of pastel colored powders and a few
of them are shimmery you've got a
shimmery gold in there and then the rest
of them are matte so as you might be
able to imagine this is a slightly
shimmery powder but it's definitely not
going to give you any sparkle or any
real listen to your face so it just
really does give you an incredibly
healthy looking glow again I've got this
on all over my face after my foundation
and then you could probably use a
smaller brush just to pick out those
slightly more shimmery areas if you did
want to use as a highlight but I think
all over to be honest you use this if
you've having a dull skin day or if
perhaps your foundation a little bit
matte you just want to add a little bit
of life to your face then this is just
absolutely beautiful I just I just can't
stop looking at it
gorgeous big lid in the mirror as well
so great to having a Hamburg I just
can't fault this and I can't wait to use
it even more and really get to know the
product and just bring it more into my
daily routine a few new pieces as well
from Estee Lauder and firstly they
pulled out three new eyeliners
one of them is emerald and then there's
a brown and a black what I love about
these if I can get into it is the fact
they're roll-up so this is the SZ Lauder
Double Wear infinite waterproof eyeliner
and I've got the shade espresso which is
go to the brown one here brown eyeliner
I love instead of black because it's
from black find black sometimes a little
bit too intense and too bold
whereas Brown is just a little bit
softer and to make it even more softer
I've just pulled it into the sharpener
area the new honors have got a smudging
stick on the end so you can read blend
it in and kind of push the eyeliner into
the eyelash line which I love for a
really soft smokey was still quite an
intense eye because it's waterproof this
lasts all day and the fact that it's
scroll up means you don't need to
sharpen it so a really lovely classic I
can imagine this being a pulp product
from Estee Lauder I think they're new in
maybe they're just new to me but it just
seems like such a classic products that
everyone should own and I think things
like eyeliner especially when they're
not pencil because sometimes you just
end up with a stump really worth
investing in so yeah this has become my
new daily eyeliner from Estee Lauder and
I've also been a fan of this past week
or so of their new or dark ego eyeshadow
palette which really took me by surprise
because I'm not a very black and grey
and blue eyeshadow palette kind of girl
I'm more of a brown kind of girl but
these are shapes I think it's more the
consistency of the powder that made me
be like wow these are incredible because
while they are powders they feel so soft
when you apply them onto your eyes they
almost feel creamy it's so hard to
describe in words I have to say Esther
daughter I'm not fan of these brushes I
found that my more bristly brushes made
this go on so much more beautifully the
color payoff is incredibly intense very
pigmented so go lightly on these I find
that this just these these brushes a
little kind of sponge ones just almost
work a little bit stripy and just too
too much color payoff ways if you can
tap off a bristle brush then
absolutely stunning I think again a
really really classic product
I hope these on you I mean I only got
them recently so maybe they're just the
cult Estee Lauder eyeshadows but either
way I haven't tried testing your
eyeshadows before and now I am in love I
actually have too much orders to show
you or two sets of eyeshadows one of
which being this which you have probably
seen here they're in everywhere but I
wanted to add my 10 pennants about it
and it's the Too Faced chocolate bonbon
palette I am in love with this palette I
love Too Faced palettes I think there
are just so many eyeshadow poets out
there but this honestly is spectacular
not only the packaging beautiful pink
tin heart shaped eyeshadows yes
heart-shaped which I know just
absolutely love scented yes this makeup
on I've got a con stop let's make my
mouth water I need a kinder egg it's
scented like chocolate but really
sweetened ah you guys if you're in
doubles or anything you need to just go
and smell this because it's stunning but
what I love about this palette is so
many wearable shades sometimes I find
like with the urban decay Gwen there's
just a few of those I can't use whereas
in here but you're not too sure on these
two here but we will learn you know you
never know and but I mean dark truffle
cashew almond truffle pecan praline
praline so many absolutely gorgeous
shades in here and it's perfect for like
a smoky eye perfect for just you know
and you just want to have a little
little base bit of shadow in there
slightly darker base I just can't even
tell you how in love I am with all of
these colors and also
I'm pretty gonna say it's wrong but
molasses chip this gold sparkly one here
is actually sparkly I find it so hard
for eyeshadows with sparkle shimmer to
actually come up sparkly on my eye
whereas this when I apply it in few
layers over another shadow from the
palace actually gives me a beautifully
sparkly eyes so gorgeous in the evenings
you really do get that lovely glimmer
really catches the light and it smells
like chocolate so you can just imagine
how in love I am with this palette and
the last eyeshadow palette I shall
mention is kind of the opposite end of
the scale not quite as crazy girly pink
and wacky but equally as fabulous very
chic so it really depends what your
eyeshadow packaging style preferences
are but I mean look at these colors this
is the Bobbi Brown new - nude I think it
is nude or nude eyeshadow palette and if
you are like me a lover of nude eyes you
don't really stray too far away from the
whole soft brown smokey to push but
normally just like an everyday kind of
brown then this is the palette that you
need every single color in here it's so
usable I never thought that I would try
a pinky brown on my I just never really
occurred to me I never had one before
but this makes the most beautiful base
color I think when your blond then it
just really adds a bit of warmth to the
face these are just absolute stunning
for kind of using as an eyeliner this
brush here I actually do really like it
it's got the narrow end here you can't
really see that it's got a narrow end so
you can just Pat it into the dark color
and push it really close to the eye line
to give a bit of a liner and and then to
be honest I only use that one as a liner
and very rarely I use it for a little
bit of kind of eye contouring because
every other color here is just a most
beautiful base color so if you're the
kind of person that just has a beautiful
wash of color and then a flick of
eyeliner then this is just absolutely
stunning
love the seats and packaging it's great
for taking away on holiday with you ah
probably Brown I feel like you were
thinking of me when you created this
eyeshadow palette it's just it's just
gorgeous and the last two products that
I wanted to show you are also from Bobbi
Brown so they're Springs from a
collection it's just absolutely gorgeous
and the other thing I wanted to show you
was this because it's a powder with a
little bit of shimmer in it but kind of
sometimes a girl on one is really really
good for using all over the face but
also if you rub it in bright places it
can be used as a highlight so I'm the
kind of person that on an everyday basis
I don't really want to wear highlighter
I just don't make don't make that much
efforts with my daily makeup if that
makes sense
whereas this because you can't just
swipe the brush all over and get a
lovely healthy glow you can also you can
see that a couple of these squares those
two and that one there are a lot more
shimmery than the other so you can
really use this particular brush just to
focus it on those areas that they don't
double it onto the sparkly bits and then
use that as a highlighter so lovely -
and one to be completely honest with you
there is not that much difference in the
use cases of these palettes I have to
say of course I prefer the packaging off
the curl and I mean I just just I have
no words for this it's just absolutely
beautiful I love the pastel colors
within it the Bobbi Brown I just feel
like is almost a safer option as I said
they do really really similar jobs this
one is probably easier if you did really
want to use that Selective highlighting
part of it because it's really easy to
find the highlighting colors the
shimmery bits they're a little top up so
if you are after a powder and using it
as a highlighter then I go for Bobby
Brown whereas if you just want something
really really fabulous to give you an
all-over glow but on the odd occasion
come use as a hard lighter then go on
yeah really not that much between them I
love them both
don't make me decide so that's it those
are my favorite high-end luxury Beauty
launches for February I'm already
starting to hear whispers of things that
are coming in March and I just don't
know how
companies do it so hopefully you've
enjoyed going through a few these
products of me I understand that a lot
of these are quite high price points so
where possible I'm definitely going to
keep on trying them out as tough as that
will be and I will update you on the
blog and here on my youtube channel as
to which ones I absolutely love these
are my favorites from the February
launches so all of them I already love
first impressions are really really good
but as I said can't wait to keep
bringing these into my daily routine and
really kind of become more familiar with
them and of course I will be sharing my
thoughts with you if there are any
particular products here that you do
want to know more about then definitely
let me know tweet me or leave a comment
below and I shall make sure that I
really focus on that one I hope you've
enjoyed this video and enjoyed looking
all these gorgeous products with me and
I will see you very soon in my next one
