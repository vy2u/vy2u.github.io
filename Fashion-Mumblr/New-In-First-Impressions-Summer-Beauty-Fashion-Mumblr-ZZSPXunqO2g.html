first impressions video I've seen a
couple of things on YouTube recently and
I really wanted to give it a go because
there's so many new products that I
really wanted to show you guys I thought
I'd make it a little bit different by
putting some of them on my face as I
talk about them
hence the hair back and not very much
makeup look I am currently rocking I
thought it'd be really interesting it to
go through my first impressions to let
you know what I think of these products
whether I would recommend you go out and
buy them or not whether they might be
good for your skin type or whether maybe
you've already got something in your
makeup drawer which does the job just as
well so where possible I try and compare
them to other things I've got in case
you wanted to find something similar so
I'm going to start with a bunch of
products and the first thing is the
Rimmel match perfection foundation now I
used to be absolutely in love with the
Rimmel 25-hour foundation so if you
really liked that one then I think
you'll also really like this one they
have a lot more shades of this one so if
you ever struggle to find your shades
and I'm not sure exactly how many but I
think that they are all really bendable
actually have this shade which is 201
classic beige and it also has the shape
which is slightly paler so I think when
it gets into autumn when I start to lose
what's left of my summer time then I'll
just gradually start to mix the two
together which should be quite a good
way of creating like a bespoke
coloration which should hopefully be a
good color match all year round coverage
wise this is really good I've been using
this on days when I think I'm going to
have lots of photos taken
I recently wore it to a friend's wedding
and it has a really good photo finish
there's quite an airbrush effect similar
to the 25 hour foundation so I really
like it in that way and it also has
great lasting power I actually wore it
yesterday at feat festival I put a
little bit into a little moody pot and
then spritz dry face with the Urban
Decay all nighter and I just didn't need
to top up my makeup from when I left the
house at 8 o'clock in the morning
to 11 or 12 o'clock at night when we hit
the tents so I highly recommend this one
and I think it's about 899 I'm sure it's
around the 10 pound mark and there's
loads in that definitely definitely
recommend this I actually rediscovered
my hourglass immaculate finish
foundation I'm sure it's called that the
liquid powder one and tried that and it
just didn't compare to this one so the
hourglass I think is about 40 pounds if
not more but I actually prefer this one
so highly highly recommend this one you
haven't tried the run on $25 all this
one then just swatch them in the shop
and I'm sure you'll be really impressed
next up in the budget category there is
the very own flawless light reflecting
concealer so if you saw my vlog that I
posted last week you'll see that I
actually went to the baryon Factory and
saw all their cosmetics being made and I
was really kinda given with these in my
goodie bag when I left and it took me a
little while to try it because I'm just
so in love with my NARS creamy concealer
but I actually tried this three days ago
as this as a real first impression and I
was so impressed with my NARS creamy
concealer I sometimes find that it sets
into my under eye wrinkles that was kind
depressing but this I'm wearing it today
as well I just have my tinted
moisturizer on and this as far as
concealer goes and it's really
illuminating I probably would have
actually picked this shade it's probably
a little bit paler than the ones I'm
only going for this is shade number two
so I presume there's also one I'm not
sure how many it goes up to but paler
mode normally I've gone for but I think
it's quite brightening around the eyes I
do suffer from terrible eye bags and
stab dull eye area but this has really
lifted the whole area and as it's very
young it's going to be a really really
good price so if you're looking for a
decent under eye concealer but you don't
want to spend as much money as the nose
one then highly recommend this one
something else which I guess you could
say is a budget product because it is a
cheaper alternative to something
switching my pedal program it's the
magnet own barefaced facial cleanser so
I am a big big lover of the para sonic
and anything else that comes along I
always give it a try but always end up
going back to my Paris on it I haven't
tried this yet it only actually arrived
yesterday along with loads of other
really lovely healthy skin things there
was some kale chips I was a little
bottle with charcoal and it was meant to
be really good for cleansing the system
it was carrot juice which is still nice
drink but basically the whole idea was
that it's all about singing benefit
something good for your skin so new
magnet own I've got a really lovely pink
color it basically has everything that I
like about the kara sonic within this
product so it's got the 22nd beeping
which means that you move on from a
different area so previous special
cleanses I've tried you don't know when
is roughly the right time to move on so
you're supposed to spend about 20
seconds on the forehead 20 seconds on
the t-zone then telling your cheek but a
lot of facial cleansers don't tell you
when to move on
whereas this actually beeps when you
move onto the next area so I really love
that I also really love that it's
waterproof completely waterproof so you
can put it in the shower or in the bath
if you drop it it's a no big deal
obviously you want them to be waterproof
so that's really good and it's also got
two different settings so it's got the
constant vibrating setting and then it's
got a pulsing setting so I guess maybe
on your chin or on your nose you've got
an area that's really congested you can
just really give it a good SAP and I
don't think my qur'anic actually has
that functionality so that's an added
bonus I think the mic and tone is around
half the price of the Clarisonic and I
did try an older magnet on a long long
time ago and I did get along really well
in fact I wrote a blog post comparing
all the minut differences between the
magnet tone and the Clarisonic and there
really aren't that many I just kind of
went back to the Clarisonic just because
it feels better quality and I'd say
that's probably the only negative about
this it just
feels a little bit cheaper and not as
sturdy as the Clarisonic but I mean for
half the price and I'm betting that the
replacement brush heads are a lot less
expensive to replace as well so I think
for a budget alternative before just a
really really good starting facial
cleansing brush management is definitely
a good one to try next up a brand which
I always thought was really budget but
this new range that they brought out or
at least new packaging really does not
make it look budget at all and it's new
things in from kiko haven't actually
tried any of these yet but they all have
the most beautiful rose gold packaging
I'm not sure if you can see it very
clearly but here I've got a new
intensely lavish lipstick in a really
beautiful kind of pinky toe crocheted
there's also a contouring pencil bronzer
and highlighter which came in the same
packet and packaging these absolutely
gorgeous so it's light pink on the main
barrel and then rose gold to live in
rose gold base is so so pretty and they
look really similar to the kanika
trouble stick highlighter and bronzer so
I'm sure they will apply questioningly
I'm going to do some swatches and show
some close-ups on the camera around now
so as you can see I haven't tried these
on my face yet but I would definitely do
a blog post on how they work comparing
them maybe to the Clinique ones and
maybe doing some instructions if I can
figure out myself because I don't think
I'm going to be terribly natural at
doing cream bronzer and highlighter cos
normally a more powder person but I'm
really excited to get these to go and
the packaging it gets 10 out of 10 for
me I just think it's really really
beautiful
so the lipstick I think is going to be
the first thing that I'm going to
actually apply I really like the look of
this color and it's quite neutral so
seeing is what I'm going to be doing
with my eyes later I think important for
me to try out I always hate using a
lipstick for the first time they're so
pretty and this has got a really nice
kind of not sure this as a Kiko logo but
it's got a really lovely and kind of
pattern on the actual lipstick barrel
itself
so the texture of this lipstick is
really lovely almost feels like a bomb
and I'm applying it really really soft
and smooth and it's got quite a I won't
say it's kind of halfway between matte
and glossy finish it's just a really
lovely kind of halfway in between matte
and gloss you really can't put my finger
on the shade of this I'm sure if I use
some tissue to blot it would be quite
matte but I really like this kind of
halfway house that it is at the moment
shade wise I'd say it's come out a
little bit Pinker than it looks in the
barrel this almost looks like a dusty
brownie pink rose on the lips it's come
out a little bit more of a girly kind of
floral pink but that's not a bad thing
they feel looking for a brownie pink as
opposed to more girly pink then maybe go
a shade even browner than this one sorry
if I have changed positions I just had
to go into my memory card because it got
full so the next thing that I'm going to
try is the Smashbox the fusion the soft
lights highlight on the crowd I just had
to remind myself that it's called I
haven't actually used any proper makeup
products from Smashbox before just their
primers so looking forward to giving
this a go I'm not really sure how
they're pants that's really good quite
softly I'm using a sigma face brush to
apply this and it's going to go quite
soft makers as I said that don't really
know
this is going to go doesn't look like a
huge amount is coming off on a brush so
gonna give every bit more as well and
then just going to pop some of this on
my cheekbones so just from that small
amount that I had on the brush its given
a really really light highlighting which
we're gonna be good for an everyday look
but on the other side I'm going to go a
little bit stronger see if we can build
up a tall so I'm not sure how much you
can see on the camera but basically I've
gone in twice on this side and just once
on this side and I'd say that it's still
quite a natural finish this one is
definitely more than everyday whereas
this I would do if I had the special
event or something it's given a really
nice almost iridescent kind of moonshine
shimmer to it which I really like
mightily to everybody's taste but I
think it's really pretty especially
because the product itself is pink based
so it's almost a replacement blush
because it gives a really nice girly
finish though nice school or really
pretty everyday look or again built up
for an evening look I think this
probably would be too pink to use as a
highlighter on any other areas sometimes
I take it up onto the forehead and even
on 20 but I think given the pink base of
this one I'm just going to use it on the
cheek areas I do really like the finish
of this though and I think this will be
one of the highlight is that our reach
for an everyday basis so next up we have
the benefit air control and again if you
saw my vlog you would have seen me going
up on the crane to have lunch for the
launch of this which was by far the
coolest product launch like ever been on
so it's called a BB cream eyelid primer
so as you can probably guess it's got
more functions and just keeping the
eyeshadow at one for longer one of the
things that I'm most excited about is
the environmental field so if you live
in a city like me
in the middle of London then you might
be thinking about the effects the
environment has on your skin and
especially the dentist skin around the
eye area so it says that the aptril has
an envirotank complex which helps guard
leader eyelids against sun and smoke and
pollutants so that's definitely the kind
of thing that you want to be thinking
about if you don't want to get that
wrinkled or crack like skin on your
eyelids the product itself is a really
light cream color so if you sometimes
like to put your foundation over onto
your eyes as almost like a base and this
will do the trick for you and the nib
itself is really really soft it's meant
to be even more delicate than using your
fingers to apply the product so it's
great to apply directly instead of
having to put it on the back of your
hand or anything I've only used this a
couple of times and every time I have
noticed that my eye shadow hasn't been
creasing so much so haven't been having
to blend it in in the middle of the day
like sometimes I have to Chiqui on hot
days you've luckily had a few of those
in London recently but I've just found
that my eye shadow hasn't been creasing
up so much I can't really comment on the
environmental protection of this as I've
only been using it for a few days but I
think that's something that we're going
to benefit from in the long run they're
definitely something for you to try if
it's something that you're concerned
about and generally if you just want
your ISO to stick around longer because
I definitely found that it works wonders
for that next I'm going to talk about a
skin care product and pixie Beauty have
bought out a new skincare range
previously I don't think they had any
skincare products but autumn/winter this
year they're bringing out a few key
products for skin care one of the things
which I'm the most excited to try is the
blow mud cleanser so it says it's a deep
purifying cleanser and I'm wondering if
this could be a dupe for these Sunday
Riley play cleanser which I've been
absolutely loving so I'm really looking
forward to giving this a go and
Parador - I think if you have slightly
oily or combination skin and mud
cleansers are really great because they
do tend to throw out the impurities just
like a charcoal facemask would but also
putting nutrients into the skin so I'm
really looking forward to trying this
and comparing it to a Sunday Riley
because if it's anywhere near as good
then it's going to be a really good
fudge alternative so definitely write
like a comparison post slash review on
the blog soon then we have a
multitasking product so this is the neon
organics daily boost for face body and
hair it's an oil product and it looks
quite watery in the bottle but I
actually tried it if you saw my get
ready with me video you'll see that I
actually use this on my hair and to be
honest I do find it's a little bit heavy
for my hair I think I actually put a
little bit too much on when I first
tried it because I follow the oil really
kind of stayed in my hair which I don't
really like I think I will probably use
a fraction of the amount next time so it
must be quite a strong product to do
that to my hair normally my hair's
really absorbent so I was quite
surprised at this really stuck in my
hair and I had to actually bring some of
it out before it could start it it's got
a lovely fragrance and I really like the
whole mood enhancing effects of me on
products so I think this might be
something that I'll apply before bed
just warm it in the palms of my hands
and Pat it onto my face maybe on the
like decollete area as well because it
has got a really calming and soothing
fragrance so fitness care is something
that maybe I'll just stick to using on
the body so this is something that I got
really really excited about when I first
heard about it I first heard about this
actually a few months ago I think at the
beginning of summer but I've actually
only just got it to try it so I'm really
looking forward to giving this a go and
it's the Vita Liberata crystal bronzing
powder and what makes this different to
normal fronting powders is that
apparently it actually builds up a
lasting tan so you want to take a makeup
off your lap it's a bit of a tan and you
can build it up so that you can either
give yourself cheekbones on all over
glow just from a bronzers so I'm really
looking forward to trying this out so
just put some in the lid and it looks
really really dark I'm just gonna
move a towel over so they don't spill
any on Fed but it looks quite dancin
they're just going with the cheekbones
for this to start with so it's actually
not as dark as I thought it's going to
be the bronzing powder on the lid looks
really dark but on most skin you can't
really see that I've got my chance I'm
going to do it another time so I've just
applied some on my cheekbones and I can
see in the camera in the little
viewfinder it looks like I've got
absolutely loads and looks quite
striking but actually in my mirror here
it really doesn't look like I have that
much on the toilets more subtle so I'm
going to blend it a little bit more into
my face because I don't want to end up
with strategy bones
I really really like this color I feel
like that because of its whole power of
having the lasting bronzing effect that
it wouldn't be a terribly good bronzer
as a makeup but actually I really really
like this color it's slightly orange II
but I quite like that effect so I think
this is probably my favorite ones that
tried in a long time which is quite a
big accolade to give to your products
but I'm really really liking the color
that this is given my face be
interesting to see if this does have any
effect on the bronze deenus of my skin I
have got tinted moisturizer and now the
Smashbox product underneath this so
hopefully I won't and over the really
strange tan lines or anything but I will
ain't know how I get on and if I really
really love this product then I'll be
writing about it on the blog so keep a
lookout for that but first impressions
are that it gives a really lovely
bronzing color it's not really got any
shimmer particles in it so it's quite a
matte bronzer and although it looks
really dark in the tub I'd say that it's
quite a medium finish then we've got a
few things from Clarins and I've
actually had these sitting in my to try
area for so long and I've been wanting
to show them in a big area so I haven't
even tried them yet which has been
absolute torture because I absolutely
love carries and I'm just seeing them
sitting that has made me really want to
dig in and try them out but I saved them
for this video so let's get stuck in
with the Clarins first thing from
currencies is absolutely gorgeous little
eyeshadow palette it comes in a lovely
this is actually a cardboard box whereas
normally their products come in and
promos metallic boxing which makes it of
course a lot lighter so I think this is
going to be really good
or traveling inside the lid we've got a
really big mirror I'm not gonna blind
you for do that and also five absolutely
beautiful shades of eyeshadow all the
way from a cream to a pinky metallic
shade a really beautiful taupe metallic
shade a darker I'd say almost like a
dark chocolate shade and then this I'm
safe actually slightly lighter but it's
a more metallic kind of property brownie
shade all absolutely beautiful from the
everyday up to more a smoky evening that
look I think this one on the end can
make a really nice kind of brow bone
highlighting products and of course
you've got a brush in here which Scott
the actual brush and a sponge brush so
basically everything that you need for
touch-ups on the go or if you want to
pop this in your handbag or travel bag
and see perfect these are the kind of
colors I just find myself reaching for
all the time and especially in the
autumn winter these Browns and like
pinky Browns I absolutely love I think
on blondes brunettes to us I think these
colors to suit everybody so I think this
is definitely going to be a favorite
product so I'm going to be using a lot
in the palette they're all quite
shimmery but if you're more of a matte
eyeshadow lover they clones have also
brought out some more on brain that
eyeshadows these ones I have tried and
loved before and I have quite a few in
my collection now but they don't seem to
go down so they're really good if you
just want an investment eye shadow if
you find a shade like this one this is
the shade oh wait Heather so it's brown
with a side / blue tinge to it if you
find a shape that you really really like
and want to use it every day then the
Clarins on when that's not absolutely
perfect for that because no matter how
much you use them they never seem to go
down so great investment eyeshadow it's
got a really good color payoff but
without being too over-the-top so I
think this would be a great build or eye
shadow and beautiful packaging as always
imperative of this gorgeous little glass
tub with a pretty rose gold lid and also
from the clients water winter collection
is a new one of their roof acai
lipsticks of
number 21 in 20 rows the packaging of
this I don't think they've used this
packaging before it looks like a
slightly different style but I'm really
really liking it it's more of a light
gold and as you think the Coens
lipsticks used to be in the silver
bullets but this gold is really really
beautiful the actual lipstick itself I'm
not actually the hugest fan of this
shape of lipstick bullet if that makes
sense I prefer and they have let the
point to the top because I really find
you have to use a lip liner when they
come in this kind of more circular shape
because otherwise you just tend to get
it everywhere the color however is
absolutely gorgeous I think this is the
kind of shade that I'll definitely be
wearing a lot of thrown winter it's like
a very dusky rose pink almost a brownie
color and it looks quite nice as well so
I think I will do a makeup tutorial or
blog post up on these because they look
absolutely gorgeous can't try it now so
all you got to keep your lipstick on but
I love the look of this I always am
really impressed with Karen's lipsticks
I find them very balmy and very
moisturizing even if they do have a
matte finish a lot of them have SPF in
as well as and actually say on the
bottom of this house SPF or not but I
wouldn't be surprised if it had some
kind of nourishing ingredients for the
lips because a lot of times things
surprise you by having lots of multiple
benefits so I'm sure this is another one
of those another one I've been really
excited to try for a while is the new to
me chubby lash fattening mascara so
you've had the chubby stick lip balms
and the blushes and now we have a chubby
mascara as you can guess the wand is a
really really fat chunky one so I guess
this is going really great for building
very voluminous lashes I've got a little
bit of mascara on at the moment but I'm
going to give this one a go now as well
so I think are we really great for
building on it because it was for her to
just thicken up the lashes
so cut on one eye and not the other and
immediately I can tell that it's
incredibly lengthening I've already got
the scar on this eye but it's so obvious
here that I've applied the HIV - my
lashes does look five times longer and
thicker and darker than on the original
eye the brush itself is quite stiff
plastic with actually really short
bristles so it surprises me that it's so
lengthening
but it's really good for really wenching
in between the lashes if you know tomato
just kind of comb it through the lashes
which is great for picking up all the
individual hairs I'm really impressed by
the darkness and it really almost looks
as though I've got an eyeliner on
because it's so intense and black along
the eyelid line you know the bottom
lashes it just seems to stick to the
lashes and just add such intense black
color so I'm really impressed with this
gonna put on the other eyes I don't know
like a strange one eyed person
I'm really excited to try this on its
phone tomorrow when I do my makeup
because I think if this is the effect
that it gives on top of other mascara
then it's great you really do it on its
own so really impressed first
impressions with this and can't wait to
try it by itself in speed through these
a little bit more quickly because dawn
is here five hour long video the next
thing is this lip balm which I got from
a brand called bad knee I never heard of
waxy London before but a little parcel
arrived for me and the favorite thing
that I've tried so far is this lip balm
firstly the packaging and the smell
first impressions for those two things
are incredible it has got the most
incredible scent it's really makes my
mouth which makes me think of sweets but
it's still very rosy it almost smells
like raspberries okay so it's a
raspberry tinted moisturizer I think
that smell is definitely raspberries but
it's a really really beautiful package
and sent it on and the color payoff as
well it's a slightly tinted bomb when
you apply it to the skin but without
being too tinted so if you want to just
you
so the next thing is from a brand called
Banksy London I never heard of backseat
before but I got a few of their products
in the posting of the day and the one
that I've been most impressed with so
far is the lip balm so this is their
raspberry tinted moisture balm and
firstly the packaging absolutely love
it's any kind of card quality kind of
truth but the scent is what we most love
about this the raw sweet scent doesn't
make my mouth melt it's really really
beautiful I love that when you have it
on you can still smell that incredible
fragrance as well so if you really like
lovely fragrance lip balms and this is
definitely wanted to try moving swiftly
on we have the Vichy dermablend
foundation compact this I actually
picked up from an event that they had
recently and I was really impressed by
the packaging because I find that
sometimes at work at four or five
o'clock I just want to touch up my
makeup in certain places like on the
chin on the forehead maybe my previous
makeups melted away or I just want a
little bit more coverage I thought this
packaging would be absolutely superb
putting in my handbag
pshoo products always get along really
well with my skin I find their serums
and moisturizers always just calm and
balance out my skin's I thought this
hopefully would have similar effects but
with foundation properties as well so
I've not actually tried this yet but I'm
really excited to give it a go it's also
SPF 30 and I am really trying to use SPF
on an everyday basis just because I'm
really worried about getting premature
wrinkles and things like that so the
factors SPF 30 is a real bonus for me
on the packaging it says high coverage
no mask effect and ultra resistant so
that sounds like all the things that I
definitely want to get in a foundation I
wouldn't say there's a huge amount in
here as the thing that it uses quite
sparingly I'm probably not going to be
applying this as an army first thing in
the morning
main makeup but I think as a handbag
top-up this is going to be an absolute
yes I'm really looking forward to giving
us a go and then the last thing that I'm
going to talk about is the naked poor
Urban Decay smoky palette I'm actually
go to me a little bit closer to the
camera because I want to give this a go
on video so you guys can see my real
first impressions off and they get smoky
palette sudden you realize it's going to
really really funny me suddenly being
close at the camera but anyway now at
least you can see the urban decay naked
smoky palette so the packaging is
absolutely beautiful it's almost like
smoke trapped and glass a really really
gorgeous packaging so inside you've got
12 really really beautiful shades
ranging from everyday kind of matte
shades you've got some neutrals either
side some shimmery ones and some matte
ones and then you've got the intense and
more smoky eye shades in the middle
there ranging through the purple you've
got some silver in there as well but I
think I'm going to start with the shade
combust so I'm going to start with 13
which is this white kind of shade on the
end I'm just going to use that on the
brow bone area I'm just using the brush
that came in the packet I always find
out the urban decay brushes do a
perfectly good job of creating a smoky
eye this one's actually an updated
version so it's got the really blendable
one on the end and then this angers are
more tightly packed a lot smaller brush
so I guess really great for lining the
eyes and just really blending it and I'm
just going to use combust and put that
all over the lids
and I'm going to use whiskey full of
cliche just to start to build in the
smokey effect I really like this shape
so I'm gonna use whiskey again with the
smaller end of the brush to bring that
down on my lower lash line I think if
you're going for a smoky eye then it
helps to really bring the color down to
the lower lash line just to complete the
look a little bit more and that's the
thing as much as I do for an everyday
smokey look obviously I've only just
spent a couple of minutes creating this
look here but I wouldn't do much more
than this for an everyday look there's
so many more shades in the power you
could use for more of an evening look
I've only used matte shades as well and
there's lots of shimmering shades in
here which would definitely build up to
create a lovely sparkly smoky eye so so
far at first impressions really like
this I didn't think it would be good for
an everyday palette so I'm really
pleasantly surprised that there's some
non shimmering really nice everyday
colors and quite neutral shades so if
you're wanting to build a smoky eye but
think that isn't too intense
then it's definitely not so even that as
a first smoky palette if you don't have
one two or three think this is a really
tough one so I can see my battery sign
flash with me so I'm going to wrap this
video up here really hope you've enjoyed
this video I hope you've enjoyed going
through a lot of new things with me
hopefully there's been something in
there that's caught your eye maybe
something that you'd like to try out so
