joining me for today's video I have been
planning today's video for quite a long
time I've been saving up products so
that I can show you all in one go
instead of just spreading them out over
a few different videos so today I'm
going to go through loads of new in
products which I'm sure you will love
looking through as much as I love
looking through there is perfume
there are high-end beauty products
drugstore these products and even a
really cool new hair gadget which I'm
really excited to show you and as there
is quite a lot of things to go through
and my bed is currently covered in
beauty products I'm not gonna Rumble too
much I'm just gonna get straight in that
so I'm going to start with perfume and
the first thing is new Marc Jacobs
decadence perfume and the first thing
that strikes me about this is the box
obviously it is not like your normal
perfume box it's actually almost like a
velvety suede texture to it with the
name of the perfume engraved in gold
obviously not real gold but embossed in
gold in the front so packaging wise this
is stunning for the box but then the
perfume itself is just another level
this is obviously inspired by Marc
Jacobs handbags it's got an almost I
don't think it's real but it's like a
Python design on the lid beautiful gold
chain and a black tassel so anybody that
really likes to have perfumes on this
bow their dressing table and just
something a little bit more opulent will
absolutely love the design of this scent
wise and by the way it's really heavy so
um this is the size of the perfume
bottle and this is the size of the link
so quite quite um heavy on the design
but fragrance wise it's a very mature
scent so not one to buy your little
sister but maybe normal for that person
in your life that really likes that bit
of luxury I'm already thinking ahead to
Christmas like telling you who should
buy this for maybe you just want it for
yourself but I think this is really good
for the person that likes something a
little bit more indulgent it's
definitely definitely a mature fragrance
is quite woody and I think that's
probably some Jasmine and definitely a
little bit of rose in there as well it's
a very likeable scent but
not for everybody because it is quite a
grown-up sentence for something that's a
little bit lighter it's really bright in
the camera but this is the new Chloe
fragrance and for Miko fragrances are
just one that I just loved growing up I
think every girl needs to have a Chloe
fragrance this is a new one which is a
little bit lighter than their previous
fragrances it's got that beautiful glass
and metal bottle which i think is so
pretty I remember I used to obsessed
with leave you blonde and L words don't
mean she has one of these but just that
was when I was at my most girly when I
was obsessed with that and I just
absolutely loved this bottle and this
fragrance is so feminine and drop the
lid and this new one is just a softer
version of their previous fragrances and
how little spritz now it's just so
lovely
very delicate obviously that rose scent
as with all the programs from the Chloe
fragrances but yeah this is a really
peaceful new one from Chloe then a
slightly different fragrance this is the
new angel by Thierry Mugler and I've
always really liked the angel fragrances
my box has actually been gnawed by my
puppy some might struggle to get into
this one so it's got that gorgeous star
design which we know and love from the
previous fragrances by Thierry Mugler
and that seemed really cool them like
button over there I mean so that's good
thing but it's quite similar to the
previous angel but I would describe this
as more of a masculine scent this room
is gonna smell so amazing when I'm done
and if there's just something about it
which is a little bit more musky and
Muscat I'm really bad at describing
fragrances but if you like kind of
there's nothing like Abercrombie face
but if you like that almost manly scent
to your fragrance like Abercrombie then
I just say that because everyone knows
that I recovery smells like then you
might like this one beautiful bottle I
really love the design of these and
they're always like economic they stand
up when you're dressing table and look
beautiful so this is the new angel by
Thierry Mugler
I've just read on the box it's called
edition fashion so yeah maybe that's
guys
scaliness kind of amorous seductive
fragrance and then finally and this is a
classic fragrance there is a new launch
from Calvin Klein and it's eternity now
so if you would love Calvin Klein
fragrances and you're gonna love this
one as well because it's very much
within the same fragrance from fragrance
family as all the other color and fine
fragrances it's in a beautiful pink
bottle when I described it slightly more
floral than the other fragrances if you
like CK one or eternity then they all
smell but you can tell that they're
related they're from the same perfume
family but this is just more girly and
feminine has definitely got more rose
scent to it and the other carbon clean
fragrance is very plastic design so this
is I mean for a gift you just can't go
wrong with Calvin Klein fragrances and
this is a really lovely more girly
version and they're moving away from
fragrances and onto haircare there's the
one gadget which I want to tell you
about because I am really really excited
about it I used it this morning and it's
basically a replacement for your normal
straightness so listen up if you're a
fan of straightening your hair so this
is the new steam-powered straightener
from L'Oreal and it's available from
look fantastic and and it's basically
like a normal hair straightener but
actually it's not like a normal
straightener so it's got that it's a
straightener which straightens your hair
using steam instead of the actual
ceramic plate on it so what you have to
do is you fill this little pod up here
which is attached by two cables there's
just one plug and then this you fill it
up with water like you would a steamer
or an iron and then it's got these
little pressed oats on the back so you
don't need to worry about spilling I
just press it down onto my windows so
while I'm doing my hair so it doesn't
you no need to worry about spilling
water anywhere because that was my first
worry and then if you used those hair
colors on you a little that you press
the top when it's steamed out that
really good fun but this is the
straightener version of that kind of in
that when you clamp it together it
releases some steam which the power of
the steam a g-strings your hair instead
of metal which obviously is
much better for your hair for me I have
naturally quite straight hair so there's
just no point in me damaging my hair by
using the hot straighteners every day so
if I can straighten my hair using steam
it's just so much better for the
condition of my hair my hair is
obviously also been color treated I get
my hair blonder in the hair salon which
is not terribly good for the quality of
your hair tends to be a little bit
drying on the end so if you straighten
your hair with steam as opposed to a
ceramic plate it's much better for your
hair and the only thing about this
obviously is is really big and you've
got this steam pod as well so not the
handiest if you're traveling or if you
do have a limited space so I'm not gonna
be chucking out my own streamers but I
think for an everyday when I just don't
want to make it too much effort with my
hair or so you can't curl with these but
I think long-term when you just want
your hair to not be frizzy and you just
want straight hair then I'll definitely
be reaching these over my old
straighteners and it insert a clip here
of my half of my hair done so I'm not
sure which side but I'll them you can
probably see from the image which side
of my hair has been done at which side
hasn't so it doesn't make a great
difference to the frizz and just
obviously the straightness of the hair
so I'm really impressed with these they
are 150 pounds from look fantastic so if
you look kind of persons change your
hair regularly but you don't have the
mega curly hair although I have watch
tutorials online and it doesn't work on
really curly hair as well and this is a
really good alternative to of the usual
strainers by the way if you are really
interested in this and you want to find
out more and want me to do a full
tutorial video then that's definitely
something I'm interested in doing so let
me know in the comments if that would be
of interest speaking of hair care there
is a new brand called colour excellence
I thought the cameras are doing waiting
for it you can't even see these I will
do a little close-ups and but color
excellence is a newly launched salon
color brand and and they've released two
core products one of which I've already
tried and absolutely obsessed with it's
their highlights brightener so ideally
if you've got blonde hair and you do get
it colored in the
but you just want to drag it out a
little bit longer you know your hair
just gets a little bit dull and you know
that you need to go to salon and get it
toned or recolored but you you just
don't want to this is absolutely perfect
for that it really just lifts the color
of your hair and and yes I've been
really enjoying using this one and
they've also launched the hair detox
which is available for every or you can
use this on every color of hair and it
says deep cleanse and revive spice or
hair color so whereas this one is
specifically for blondes I think this
one is great for just lifting the color
of every hair color and haven't tried
this one yet but it's also in the range
set thought I'd mention it as well I
forgot to mention with the steam pod
that actually it comes with or it
doesn't come with you can also buy
complementary products so this one is a
cleansing milk and you can put this on
your hair when it's wet and so if you
just how dry your hair and you want to
add something to make it a little bit
more easy to comb through then this is
really good for that and they've also
got a it's called a beautifying oil
which I obviously love using oils in my
hair and this one I applied through the
ends just now actually so when you
finish using these straighteners you can
put some oil in if you've got any
flyaways or you just want your hair ends
to be a little bit more glossy and
healthy looking then that's a really
good one for that okay and now on to
beauty and the first thing is something
which actually came to twist me this
morning so very very new in and this is
from benefit in this side that it's just
their normal and their real mascara
which we all know and love but what's
really exciting is what's in this side
so in here we've got the their real
tinted primer and this is not like
primers that you've used before which
are white and that really ugly because
you can see it sticking it through your
mascara I've never been able to do those
properly this is a brown primer so not
only does it really coat and prepare
your lashes ready for mascara but it
also doesn't show through or you can
even wear it by itself because it's
brown
so does that a little bit of volume but
if you add it with this and it's just
going to be mega mega volume I haven't
tried this yet as I said it only arrived
this morning but I think it's a really
super idea and I've always been a fan of
the derry-o scars I can't wait to give
it a go with the primers
well the rest of the beauty products I'm
just going to go through as I see them
off my bed because there's no way I can
do a proper order to this so the next
thing in front of me is this which is
the Real Techniques the makeup brush
cleaner it amazes me how many of my
friends don't clean their makeup brushes
and really you have to do it at least I
mean I do it every week and I think that
you also should do it every week because
when you think about all the oils on
your face and all the products that
you're putting on your brushes so
important to clean them I think that
makes so much of a difference to not
only the makeup application also the
health of your skin so Real Techniques
have brought out a makeup brush clean
out and mine's still in the packaging I
haven't tried it yet but as it's from
the girls I'm sure it will be up see
incredible so I thought I'd mention that
and then also worth a quick mention is
the new tweezer and collection so
tweezer month you know our favorite I
would be called tweezers my
favorite tweezer brand they fall out I
think it's their Christmas range
there's loads of products but I just
thought I would show you these two
firstly there are a new range of
tweezers not tweezers eyelash curlers
you may know that my favorite all-time
eyelash curlers are the rose gold
tweezer Minh ones and this is a black
pair but this what I thought was really
interesting is though it's actually
specifically designed for certain eye
shapes so this set here is designed for
almond and deep set eyes so it's not
quite so curved it's more flat so if you
have found that previous eyelash colors
have been too curved for you then this
might be a good one to try and then this
is a good variety - print pair of pair
of accessible tweezers also from tweeze
Minh and I just thought that that was a
really nice gift idea again we kind of
going down to Christmas route we're only
in October but already thinking about it
tweezers or something which is just so
useful to have a really good gift to
have gift it to give but it could be
quite a boring gift so these because
they're sparkly and they've got really
cool prints on them just make it a more
fun way of giving something really
useful as a gift next thing I have is
the new quarterly eye cream so this I'm
really impressed with I've been using
this
I've been using this already for maybe a
week and a half and firstly packaging
beautiful like gold I'm not sure if
that's the actual liquid in there that's
gold I don't think it's that tinted
because you can see on the back of my
hand it's a very creamy almost per
lesson not quite translucent formula but
what it does is when you apply it onto
the eye area just put myself in the eye
a little bit is it immediately brightens
the eye area so you don't need to worry
about apply meds and lotions and potions
afterwards posess has got all the good
things and eye cream it's like
anti-aging deep puffing and too wrinkled
but it also brightens straightaway
because it has got these almost kind of
pearly it's really hard to describe its
its pearly but it's not too shimmery so
it's got a really lovely consistency to
it very lot thicker than normal I creams
but the gifts I really love you finish
the eye area it's already brighter in
fact emojis dabbed some on now because
even though you're pretty not supposed
to I like to apply it over makeup as
well another new really lovely skin care
product is the new connect Moisture
Surge of melting bar I think that's the
name basically it's a bomb version of
their lovely Moisture Surge product if
you've ever tried this spray or their I
think is like a gel overnight the
moisturizer this is the balm version so
as I said I'm you can imagine it's so
much more luxurious I actually mentioned
it in my autumn conference blog post
that's one of my favorite things to use
currently when the weather's changing
don't know about you but my skin is also
changing I'm getting a little bit dry
out in the forehead I've had that crazy
problem with my cheeks if you've been
watching my vlogs you'll know that I've
just had some kind of reaction on my
cheeks and this is just such a lovely
comforting product I leave it on for
about 10 minutes and then sometimes I
eschew it off sometimes I just leave it
but it just feels really lovely on the
skin it's quite a small pop but I do
find that little goes a long way so I've
been really loving using this recently
something which is even more luxurious
is the dolphin eight flower nectar oil
cream I went to the launch of this in
summer and I was so excited for it
because it's basically in between a
cream and oil and I absolutely love
using oils but I find in the winter or
autumn time my skin's
tiny bit more nourishment so this
because it's darvon and it's from the a
toy or family it just smells so heavenly
it's honestly the most Epirus thing you
could possibly put on your face I'm sure
it's quite expensive I'm not sure the
exact price but I mean if you're running
these people that just loves to pamper
yourself from really treat yourself to
some incredible skin cat then definitely
give this a go
as I said it's between an oil and a
cream so if you're not quite sure if
you're ready for an oil or you love oils
and you want something even heavier for
winter then give this a go it's just
such a luxurious treat for the skin and
I have been loving using this next up
I'm going to quickly whisk through the
new L'Occitane products I'm just qantas
this gonna be a really long video and I
still got quite a lot to get through so
Lux Aeterna released a new honey range
there's a shower gel a ultra soft body
cream and a little bar of soap as well I
also love honey whether it's eating it
or putting it in my tea or my yogurts or
just the smell of it love honey so this
range is right up my street then I'm
moving on some more makeup products
Estee Lauder have released some new
ranges under the name new dimension I
don't know if you can see my
fingerprints on this I'm not too sure
whether I like the packaging it's a
strange turquoise color with a mirrored
front which also means you get
fingerprints all over it but this is
their shape and sculpt face kit so it's
basically got inside a cream highlighter
and cream bronzer so it's ideal for
building up contouring and bronzing if
you are a fan of cream contour kits then
this is definitely one to try because as
Laura it's gonna be amazing
I personally prefer powders just so I
feel like I have more control over them
but I really want to teach myself to be
good are using a cream bronzer and cream
highlighter so I'm gonna be playing
around with this and I'm determined to
make it work because I just know that if
I can work with it then I will
simply love it but that's new
information state order then we've got
the Christmas release from bareMinerals
this is the packaging this is the
products have already taken it out and
this is a really convenient pallet
you've got three products inside you've
got clean radiance which is a
highlighter Golden Gate which is a
lovely pink flush and then warmth which
is obviously a bronzer and you've got
the lid in the top there so really
perfect packaging very slim and very
light so this I think is lovely
obviously as a gift I need to do a gift
card video because I'm just got so many
ideas but for me where this is really
useful is that you've got three amazing
products all in one palette so ideal for
traveling if you just want to have a few
things in your everyday makeup bag this
just took so many boxes and I've been
really loving by the doors recently with
that problem I've had in my skin I've
been really careful I've been using so
I've been putting away some of my
harsher products in favour of a mineral
that minerals so yeah this is a
fantastic multitasking product another
palette which have been absolutely
loving is the new toothpaste upside down
chocolate bar palette I always always
always love Too Faced palettes I just
think they had so many beautiful
products inside and this is no exception
so you've got an absolutely gianormous
range of eyeshadow here and they're all
very kind of candy colored reminds me
almost of like autumn funfairs like
toffee apples that kind of thing in fact
I'm sure toffee apple might even be a
name of a shade you're not sure I can't
see it maybe I just made that up
but as it all to face pallets you've got
a huge selection of very wearable eye
shadows there's some slightly crazy of
shades in there like a bright blue and
then a dark blue but to be honest all
together they're all very wearable at
the moment I'm wearing a mouse on the
all-over lid and then truffled on my
crease color and I just think this is
the perfect Browns for an everyday wear
then you've also got enough shades in
there to really build it up if you want
to make more smokey eye or just
something more dramatic and a little bit
different the thing that I love about
Too Faced palettes is that you do get so
many products in there so
different colors they're quite small
squares but as I think I said in my last
beauty video whoever uses up a square
for eyeshadow I definitely don't so I
love that they give you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 they give you 16
different eyeshadows in here which I
mean is absolutely crazy there's so many
in there to choose from and I've just
I'm a big fan of to face eye shadows so
the new semi-sweet chocolate bar
love-love-love
also speaking of Too Faced I've recently
tried their Born This Way Foundation I
know this isn't actually a new product I
think it's probably been around for a
couple of months in fact I think Sabrina
and I might featured it in our last new
in Beauty but this is new to me Sabrina
had it before but now I finally got it
and I'm really impressed with this so
far I've only been using it maybe for
the past a week but I've really been
finding those very similar to my own
skin which i think is amazing in a
foundation because sometimes you just
don't want to look like you're wearing
foundation I'm actually wearing it today
so I don't know what you think of my
face today I didn't put any powder on
top because I just thought that my skin
is quite dry at the moment and this gave
a lovely coverage and I didn't feel like
I needed any additional powder so I
think considering I've just got this
foundation on and a little bit of
bronzer really impressed with the
coverage of this gift and then finally
from Too Faced this is their love flush
and long-lasting
16 hour blush so I decided to put this
to the test and I wore this all day
yesterday and can't cook
just ruin the beautiful pattern on it
can from convert can that confirm that
it's a very long-lasting blush I do not
know if it was 16 hours I put it on 8
o'clock in the morning and whereas
normally I find that you just can't
really see the blush by midday
every time I checked in the mirror you
could still very much see that I have
blush on and the packaging of this is
absolutely gorgeous there's pink heart
with a little gold to face just reminds
me of like a Barbie product I think it's
so beautiful it's actually quite hard to
open there because it doesn't really
have anything to grip on
and also the blush itself it's got its
got like a little rabbit pattern on it
beautiful you know the products are
engraved and they're just so pretty so
love this blush by the way I'm going to
be linking every product and the
I shave that I've got down in the
description box so even though I'm
whizzing through you can just go and
check them out further or treat yourself
if you like anything using the links
down below
okay so whizzing through the next thing
that I have to show you is the new range
of party lashes from earlier I
absolutely loved earlier lashes if you
watched my color on vlog you'll know
that I used some of their party lashes
and that the sparkly ones but they've
got this pair called all hail the Queen
which I've got little die Mantes on them
snow princess which is a basic pair of
lashes but with little flecks of glitter
on it so lovely for Christmas or just
any parties then they've got the
carnival lashes and these are almost
like net material so these will look
really cool if you're doing any kind of
like circus themed or if you just want
really bold crazy lashes and finally
these are the cat face lashes and these
have got the most adorable little gem
eyes and sparkly whiskers so if you're
dressing up as a cat for Halloween then
you definitely need to get these moving
swiftly on earth the next few things are
from Rimmel and Rimmel have dois loads
and new things recently I know Sabrina
and I spoke about a few in last month's
favorites video and not favorites um new
and video sorry didn't pick out
everything that's new from Rimmel but
two things that really impressed me are
there new Kate lip balm and I think lip
balms are something that you can just
never have too many of it's amazing when
you find a really good one this one I
love obviously because it's a lip stick
form so you don't need to go and get
your fingers dirty and get lip balm
under your nails like you do at the pot
um yeah it's just a very it's a normal
lip balm there's nothing too fancy about
it but it works really well and great
timing with autumn my lips get really
chapped so but I'm really enjoying using
that one and they've also bought out
this is called the moisture at renew
Universal transparent lip liner and I'm
so impressed with this I know
I think is estee lauder also have fun
but I've never seen one on the drugstore
and it's basically it's almost Vaseline
in a stick kind of kind of that texture
a little bit more waxy than Vaseline
it's just the first thing that popped
into my head but as you can guess by the
name it's a transparent lift liner which
means that you can use it to line your
lips before any lipstick so if you have
the problem of buying a beautiful
lipstick maybe you've invested in one
and the lip liner is too expensive or
you couldn't find a matching liner maybe
they didn't make one this is your best
friend because it stops the lipstick
from running into if you have any fine
lines or if you just smudge your
lipstick then this will stop it from
running and I mean as it's Remora it's
not expensive a lot cheaper than the
Estee Lauder version so highly recommend
it this and are we putting this to a lot
of good use now that I'm wearing some
darker lip colors then I want to talk to
you about the new makeup range from
autograph for Marks and Spencers I did
not even know that Marks and Spencers
did makeup but actually they now stock
so many good brands whether it's like
REM or Pixies stealer that gold
eyeshadow palette which I've preached in
my September favorites was from Marks
and Spencers but also their own brand
autograph so many amazing products so
one of my favorites I've been trying so
far is this which is that highlighter
and I'm not sure if you can see but it's
got a very cool like woven pattern and
it's a beautiful gold shade so if you
want a slightly warm glow in the autumn
time then this is definitely one to use
for that and you can just like pop it in
your basket when you're in Marks and
Spencers so overall I'm really impressed
with the MMS beauty range but this is
definitely one of my favorite products
from the whole range ok we're getting to
the last few products now and Nas have
put out some gorgeous new launches for
autumn the things that got me most
excited are their new lipsticks firstly
the packaging I just get so satisfied
when I just feel that magnetic field or
hear that magnetic click and their new
lipstick cases have that very satisfying
magnetic enclosure so love that but
aside from that their colors are
beautiful so if you can see this one
here this is shade Julie medulla
this is just me all over it's almost
like a corally pink but with a dash of
brown into it so it's great for not
quite ready to get rid of your summer
lip colors but just want a little bit
more of a subtle autumnal hint to it
this is absolutely beautiful for that
and then if you're a little bit more
daring with your lip colors this one
house before you knew this one's called
a fanny and it's like a bright purple
but a very wearable purple lip color I
never thought I'd be able to say the
words wearable and purple in the same
sentence but there's something about
this purple from nas which is just
incredibly wearable and I can't wait to
see what kind of makeup looks like to
put together using this one and last but
by no means least I have a few new
beauty products from Kiko you guys have
found that I still really don't know
that much about but every product that I
try from them I just find myself falling
in love with firstly this is their matte
muse lipstick and they say lipstick but
I would probably not call it a stick I
would probably call them I can lip stain
or something because the bottle I
actually thought it was now - to start
with but then when I saw the applicator
this is quite strange it's almost like
I'm kind of like a figure of eight shape
so if it really Nestle's onto your lips
which is perfect if you really want to
coat them but without like painting your
lips this color is not huge leave me but
you know I'm gonna try a few different
colors - else I've got in store but the
lasting power of this is real really
lovely and it's like a matte finish but
doesn't feel as drying as a matte so
really impressed with this so far Kiko
have also bought out a new color
selection of their moon shadow sticks
which if I can open it I always think
are incredibly similar to the Laura
Mercier I think they're called the eye
caviar but they are just half the price
obviously because they're Kiko and
quality-wise these are absolutely super
this is a gorgeous and kind of a very
dark navy color but it's got a little
bit of shimmer in it so I think this is
everyone are we reaching for quite a lot
in the upcoming party season and they've
also bought out some new brow products
so this is their shape and shimmer eye
brow and highlighter pencil which as you
can tell by the name has both things in
that you need for your eyebrows firstly
I really loved the color side of it it's
almost like a waxy pencil so
it's you do have to like shade it in and
then I'm probably going with a comb
afterwards but because it's a waxy
texture you don't need to use anything
to set your brows afterwards because
this not only colors what also sets the
brows in place and I have the shade and
it's oh one but I think it was called
blonde on the box after double check
yeah light chestnut and blondes is the
shade that I got and I'd say it's a
really good color match I actually had
my brows and tinted recently is a little
bit darker than they usually would be
but if you're fair like me and you don't
you're for us to be too much darker than
your hair then this is a really good
color but on the other side which i
think is really handy they have one of
these highlighting sticks which I use
today as well as the other end and it
just helps to highlight the brow bone
and I just think it's really handy that
the two products are in one because I
have got a highlighting the brow product
somewhere by always lose it it's not
convenient to find it so the fact that
it's two-in-one is really handy from
kiko I said that was if I found one more
product this is a new revlon colorburst
matte balm lip crayon and we all
absolutely fell in love with these last
winter and through summer there are some
beautiful summer shades as well this is
the shape that I'm wearing right now
which is why I thought I'd just sneak it
in at the end
it's a beautiful or tunnel very easy to
wear pinky brownie
móvil shade absolutely love the
assisters shade oh my god this is how
hard to say
it's like sultry Sofra roots it's number
two to five so if you'd like this one
number two to five there's a lot easier
to remember than the name but I'll leave
a name down below as I said so yeah
Revlon have brought out some new more
tunnel colors of their color burst from
map balms and I absolutely love them so
that's it I really hope you've enjoyed
