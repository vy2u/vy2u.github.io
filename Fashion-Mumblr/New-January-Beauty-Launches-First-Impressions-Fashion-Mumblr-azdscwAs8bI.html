is my new in products for January now I
absolutely love watching these videos I
think it's so interesting to see what
new products are being launched on the
market what I want to get my hands on
and just hearing first impressions
everything so I thought I might make
this bit of a regular feature for 2016
so let me know if you like that idea if
you also like these kinds of videos and
I will keep doing them so today's video
could potentially be a really really
long one so i'm going to whizz through
the products quite quickly because there
are so many new products this month and
so many which i absolutely love now i'm
not going to talk through every single
new launch because we would actually be
here until 2017 but instead just a few
of my absolute favorites and i'm going
to get started with luxury so i get
really really excited whenever Jo Malone
release a new fragrance because there is
always a potential that's going to be
the one that blows them all out the
water and the one I'm going to want to
make my signature scent and that has
pretty much happened with their January
Lord which is new horas and sandalwood
cologne intense so cologne intense to me
I was like oh what does this intense
mean and it's just a really really
strong version of the fragrance so this
isn't cheap I think is actually over 100
pounds i'll leave the link and the
prices to everything down below but the
fact that has occurred intense doesn't
mean that the lasting power in this
fragrance is really really incredible so
I'll spritz a few sprays of this in the
morning and still in the afternoon
evening people saying well what are you
wearing and it's this so lasting problem
this is incredible the fragrance itself
and we all know not the best to
describing fragrances but it's floral
but in a very unger leeway if that makes
sense so quite a deep floral I'd say
it's got some kind of violet e turns to
it but without being like baby shampoo
talcum powder kind of vanity which I
really really love suddenly got
something sweet about it but not sugary
and sweet sickly sweet at all so if you
love kind of slightly deeper floral
notes then I'm sure this might be one
that you're like so if you're near
journal encounter definitely recommend
you go and give this a snip next we've
got a foundation launched from YSL and
launching
the first of burberry is there to
shackle attempt foundation and as you
might got to get from the name this has
got very similar properties to our good
old favorite to to clap for under the
eyes the concealer correcting pen
because it's got something called catch
light technology in it which is
basically a particle in this which it
diffuses the light so it gives you a
really lovely soft glow when you wear
much you're wearing it right now hunk
got too much powder on but I hope for
you'll be able to see from the camera
that has given my skin quite the lovely
fresh blow so I've really been liking
using this so far it's got a medium
coverage probably good for I say most
skin types actually I mean I think it's
quite moisturizing yet I've got quite
only skimmed that I definitely don't
find that it slides around all over the
place and either day with no makeup on
so it's definitely passed that test it's
also supposedly got anti-fatigue complex
or an anti-fatigue complex in it which
is supposed to make you I'm look a
little bit more awake more alert than
combat any dullness in the skin which i
think is really really great for this
time of year in january i mean the skies
are grey our skin is gray and this has
got something to combat that and i can't
really comment on whether it works but i
have noticed so my skin looks nice and
fresh and eyeliner so I've been a really
big fan of this I'm trying this out for
maybe 10 days or so and I really really
like it switch this into my new everyday
foundation one which is super duper
luxury is a new launch from Tom Ford and
they've actually launched a new range of
lip products I think they're coming very
early fabry I'm not sure I'm the exact
date possibly the 15th i'll leave the
information down below and it's their
patron finish lip color so Tom Ford
actually invited a very few and lucky
bloggers myself included to an
incredible dinner at the Connaught hotel
is absolutely beautiful event and they
launched this as part of their new
spring collection there were also some
new I products which i'm sure i will
feature on log very very soon but this
is one that was a real standout probe to
me and here I've got the shade orchid
fatale which is an almost purpley but
still very wearable deep red color
absolutely incredible for autumn but
also I think because it has got that
kind of like pinky purple tint to it it
will be beautiful for spring as well
it's very glamorous a very kind of opium
as
expect from Tom Ford but what I would
say about this which makes it so
incredible is the lasting power now the
finish on this is very strong pigmented
color but also a shine and anything was
shine to me I just automatically presume
it's going to last like an hour tops and
every time I checked in the mirror when
I try this out the other day it was
still there not just that silly line
that appears on the edge of your lips
after you have one most shining
lipsticks of quite some time that but
the full-on color and shine intensity
was still there hours later despite many
glasses of water and cups of tea so
lasting power for a shiny lip product
this is absolutely incredible so i'll
definitely be stocking up on a few more
cuz of this as the season goes on I'm
sure it's also a huge selection of new
colors of the Clarence George lipsticks
now these I've always been such big fans
of these lipsticks I'm in the summertime
and I always love to top up on the new
collections when they come out so I've
got a couple of my favorite colors here
which are guava aren't fig fig actually
not guava and and coral tulip now these
i'll be taking with me to Costa Rica
next week because the formula is so good
for an entire day because you do get
that lovely color but also it's
incredibly moisturizing on the lips I
find for cooler months that the formula
isn't quite as thick and open opaque as
I might like so I prefer to use these on
holiday occurrence of improve the
formula again and increased the amount
of shades so you really can't go wrong
with Clarence storage lipsticks and now
the formula and the shade range is
better than ever and complement those
launches currents have also bought out
an instant light lip perfecting base now
lip primers I think or something which
is quite hard to add to your daily
routine because you'll never really sure
if they work so I put this to the test
and i'm pleased to say that I did find
quite a big difference in the lasting
power of my lipstick now I use this with
a matte lipstick and then normally quite
long lasting anyway but I didn't need to
top up my lipstick for the whole day
when I tried this out so this is almost
like a balm and in the way that it looks
and it does make your lips completely
shine-free and matter when you apply it
like a barn kind of wood do then I just
apply my lipstick straight over the top
went what my day as usual and I follow
my lipstick just looks perfect
throughout the whole day whereas
it might start to fade a little bit a
few hours later and it just felt really
comforting on the lips it seemed to be
almost like a silicone e primer but for
the lips so really enjoyed using this
one another new launch from McLaren's
out now and it seems that everybody is
bringing out lip balms at the moment
because Bobby Brown have also bought one
out this one doesn't have quite so much
bother color to it but what I do love
about it is that it's an SPF 25 and this
is their extra lip tint in the shade
bear pink and as you might guess from
the name it gives just a teeny amount of
color to the lips but because my lips
are quite dark anyway I didn't notice
that quite so much but I did really love
the formula of this didn't leave my lips
too shiny which I don't really like too
much of the lip balm so it's good for a
fast popping out the house or indeed
before I put on a lipstick so that's a
new one from Bobby Brown and then
smashing all the other bombs out the
water or the new clinic sweet pop sugar
scrub and lip balms I have still checked
the name that I can never remember what
order the words appearing and basically
these lip balms you might have seen on
my blog at at a whole post about them
they are just the most adorable
packaging they look like blue macaroons
because they've got the scrub on one
side and the bomb on the other now when
I first used it I didn't actually think
that the scrub was that good because all
i did was drag my finger over the top
and I didn't pick up too many granules
but then once I'd try a little bit
harder and I really mushed it up a
little bit i found that the scrub is
actually really really grainy and much
better than ones which i've tried from
lush because i just found that those
cheaper ones they tend to like flake all
over the place where as this really
stayed on my lips and i was able to give
my lips a real good polishing before
applying the bomb bombs themselves are
lightly tinted so you do get a little
bit of color of your lips the darker
ones do get rid of really lovely kind of
move finish to the lips but they are
quite hard shine so as i said i don't
really love that finish but i just used
a little bit of cosmetic tissue to block
them and they did leave my lips of the
lovely tint but such a big fan of these
think a really good price of 15 pounds
for scrubbing the farm or in 18 you look
gorgeous and whenever I pull us up my
handbag I just get so excited because
it's so darn cute so another product
which apparently is a new launch on
ferry the first but I actually thought
that it was already out in the UK is
the hangover ex replenishing face primer
from Too Faced maybe they've just
improved the formula but it's new to me
anyway because I've never actually tried
this primer before and to face did a
really lovely send out and they also
included a couple of these I masks in
the blogger sender which says hangover
squad in this gold sparkly iron mask
which I absolutely love I just go crazy
for things like that and but I have been
trying this primer for the first time
and I absolutely am addicted to this
already it's a very lightly silicone e
primer not quite silicone e as the
benefit Porefessional and I did find
that it made my makeup look Julie but
still Matt which i think is a really
really hard thing to achieve with a
primer and again this has been added to
my everyday routine which is a true test
of a great products I've really been
enjoying using this primer recently and
it's available in debenhams and then
speaking of primers we also have a new
one from benefit now benefit I just love
all their launches it always launch
products in the most spectacular way and
to complete their Porefessional range
they've now bought out on Matt's rescue
version of their primer which before I
tried this just flung the face mask over
and was the one that was reaching for an
everyday based and as you might be able
to guess by the name it is a very
mattifying primer but the good thing
about this is it's also moisturizing so
you can skip your moisturizer and just
go straight in with this before applying
your makeup now it's really hard for me
to toss up between the two of these
because I love them both so much the
consistency is quite different though
this is more of a gel and this is more
of a silicon II kind of feel so it
really does depend what kind of texture
you prefer as I said I love them both
equally and I'll just be interchanging
these from my everyday primer and also
from benefits as part of the
professional range they brought out some
instant wipeout masks now these are
mostly kind of strips which and go over
the nose and cheek area which I guess is
the area or you may suffer from
blackheads the most and what they do is
they just are filled with ingredients
which when you press this little button
on the Sasha it disperses it into the
mask and it really works to cleanse out
those pores now slightly disappointed my
first strikes and thought they were
going to be peel off yeah really
satisfying sensation when you peel it
away and you can see all the gross
blackheads but they're not they're
actually more of a chemical base
ask which actually I find works much
better so instead of the short term
effects of the pilaf ones I find that
these are actually been working I've
used maybe four or five now two or maybe
one or two a week and I have actually
finally noticed a reduction in my
blackheads which is incredible because
they are one of the things I'm really
concerned about my poor sighs and I do
credit these they're quite expensive i
think is 28 pounds 48 if i'm wrong i'll
leave it on the screens on right now and
but if blackheads and large pores are
concern of yours then I'm sure you won't
even think twice out swimming that may
be something that actually works next we
have a multitasking product from
Elizabeth Arden that I'm a huge fan of
their cleansing oil and of their eight
hour cream so this kind of sounded a
little bit like a blend of the two and
it's at eight hour cream all over
miracle oil now I personally have just
been using this on my body but it can
also be used on the face and the hair
and it's a really lovely fine oil mist
which I just find such a pleasure to
apply to my skin previously with oils
you have quite important to the hand
sometimes I spilled them all over the
place and I just find it goes here there
and everywhere with a spray I just spray
it on my legs and my arms on my tummy
everywhere and then rub it in and it's a
little bit thicker than other body oils
that I've tried which just makes it so
luxurious and I do find my skin stays
moisturized until the next time that I
shower so basically does everything that
it says on the tents I've really been
loving this one from elizabeth arden and
then moving down to more the drugstore
end of things we have a really exciting
launch from the Pixiwoo girls from the
Real Techniques and makeup brush range
and this is a brush cleaner so I
actually recently got one also from
Sigma but they are not available in the
UK so this is even better because
obviously it's a bit of lime boots and
it's great if you do take pride in
keeping your brushes which you
definitely should because the amount of
bacteria in them is not pretty and you
just use either this brush cleaner or
like i do just use like a baby shampoo
or any kind of soap and the little
nodules on the brush cleaner are really
great at giving your brushes a real gud
scrub getting into the inner bristles to
make sure your brushes are nice and
clean also in the drugstore this month
there are a couple of new mascara
launches the first one is the fall /
sculpt from l'oreal
when I first looked at this one I was a
little bit scared by the applicator
because it's unlike anything I've ever
seen before it's completely playing on
one side so you just can't use outside
at all and the other side almost looks
like an open and crocodiles mouths with
tiny little baby teeth sticking out and
I just I kind of didn't want this to
work because like know you've gone too
far this is too weird but actually it is
incredible so i used this on completely
bare lashes and it works absolutely a
dream at separating lifting adding
volume it really is quite spectacular
and you can tell that L'Oreal have just
been planning this and tweaking this for
so long and even though it looks really
really scary I'm really really pleased
with this and I want this frosting full
/ effect so it definitely gives my eyes
a really really wide awake look and
probably beats a lot of elemis cars it
came to be false lash effect doing so
yeah really love that one and we've also
got these super color volume on curl
mascara from Rimmel and i just love
remember Sky's when i'm so easy to use
it's got a really nice big thick fat
bristly brush with a bit of a carve in
it and i really love these kind of
brushes i find that this type of bristol
and this type of brush is my favorite
this is great for either straight on
fair lashes or even just building volume
on top of existing mascara maybe in the
middle of the date a little bit more
volume and again I mean I would say this
is anything like blow out the water but
it's a really good mascara I think about
9 pounds from the drugstore and yeah
really do like that one as well but just
nothing crazy special sorry a new launch
from Maybelline which dexter has taken a
little bit of a liking to you might be
able to see that it's completely chewed
at the top there is a dream velvet soft
matte hydrating foundation from
Maybelline now I was never a big fan of
the little pots of moosie foundation
that they brought out several years ago
but this i have found to be quite good
for my oily skin I see quite good
because when I applied it I actually
loved it I loved the finish I find it
mattifying really perfecting very
blowing but I did find that it went
quite patchy as the day went on so I
think short-term maybe for top-ups this
is great but personally my first
impression was it didn't last as long as
I can
a good foundation to last maybe I'll try
it with one of my primers next time and
keep you updated first impressions so so
but as I said if if I take your mind
imma later but something which I have
absolutely fallen in love with from
Maybelline is one of their new eyes
shadow palettes now this is their blush
nude set and as you can see inside are
just all kind of colors that i
absolutely love you've got the Browns
you got the pinks that rose golds and
the coppers all the shades i love to use
on both in every day and an evening
basis i find that they are better
actually applied with the fingers so I
find out the color pick up in the
intensity is much better when you use
your fingers to apply and a brush so
that might be like a little sneaky tip
if you're thinking of getting this one
the lighter shades in particular I find
work really well on the inner corners of
the eye and all the shades really
blendable I don't really have a bad word
to say about this but yeah definitely
try using your fingers if you're going
to go ahead with this one now I've been
waiting so long to tell you guys about
these two from bourgeois and it's part
of their news city radiance range I went
to a launch of this at the end of last
year and I've been trying these guys out
for quite some time absolutely love them
and I've mentioned them in review videos
and the tutorial videos and you guys are
asked where they're from and I have been
able to put any links but now they are
out so this is the city radiance and
brightening effect foundation and it's
got some kind of minerals in it somehow
which are anti polluting and anti
fatigue in the city so if you do live in
a city and you're worried about how the
city pollution might be affecting the
skin then this has an anti-pollution
screen in it as well as SPF 30 so your
skin is very protected from all the
environmental progresses in the city now
I don't really know if that has worked
for my skin acts I haven't noticed
natural change in my skin I love the
fact that that is potentially what it's
doing so I've been really enjoying using
that and in the same range is a new
concealer so it is correct and
illuminates and for me this has actually
swapped places with my NARS creamy
concealer so I've been putting my nose
down in favor of this and I've really
been loving not only the
the amount of coverage that it gives but
also the luminosity that adds to the
under eye area I think for a drugstore
this has just blown all the others out
the water by far my favorite under-eye
concealer I'm not sure that it's
specifically for under eyes but because
it illuminates I find that it works
really well for that area you can also
use in different areas but I have got a
shade lighter than what I would normally
go for for concealer and I've just been
using it in the under eye area and
absolutely love this one from water loss
if you're looking at getting a new
highlighting concealer then look no
further than this one and on to the last
couple of products now second to last I
have got these new baby lips on and
blush from Maybelline so I was such a
huge fan of Baby Lips I think as far as
drugstore lip balms go they absolutely
were by far the best I live with tinted
ones all of the plain ones just so there
are absolutely super and now Maybelline
have brought out a selection of
multitasking products which are not only
a lip balm but I blusher as you might be
able to guess from the name personally
I'm not a huge fan of cream blusher so
I've not really been using it that much
for that but I have been absolutely
loving the cute little shapes that they
come in for a lip balm like your
packaging is really cute and one of the
shades which I've got over here this is
a shade well mine says 26 m 9 oj but I
mean shimmering bronze this has been an
absolute gorgeous shade for the lips
it's actually quite mattifying for a
bomb and i think if i am to try any of
them as a blush it's going to be this
one because it's such a lovely neutral
easy to wear shades so a really lovely
new launch from maybelline just really
cute adorable little ones to have on
your dressing table as well i think the
packaging is so cute I just drop that
and tried to make it look too smooth
buttery spots and finally last but not
least I have to tell you about some new
mascaras from Revlon so Revlon this year
have decided to completely wipe out
their masks are arranged in favor of
five new mascaras and all the scars do
different things but my personal
favorite is the purple one which is a
dramatic definition one so yeah as I
said these are the only ones you'll see
all the new packaging looks like this
though I hated that's what they all look
like now and there are just five to
choose from so depending on whether you
want volume or you want separation and
but yeah I've gone for the dramatic
definition one which is the purple one
because I absolutely love the
as I said before I love this kind of
bristly one that's quite a stiff plastic
which really you can wiggle in between
the lashes and create some major
separation these are all I believe 699
but again i'll leave it on the screen
and and yeah revlon have really thought
about all the different needs that you
might need for your lashes depending on
your particular preference and there is
a mascara for you you can probably mix
and match then get a couple see which
one you like the best but i think revlon
have done so well to just really refine
it down to those five because the market
is so awash i probably can name about 10
different revlon and sorry rimmel
mascara l'oreal have god knows how many
so well done revlon for cutting the crap
out and just whittling it down to just
five because there's too much out there
and this is kind of like a sigh of
relief so that's it that's my pick of
the new in products for January 2016
hope you guys have enjoyed going through
this little well wind tour of a few of
my favorite products let me know if
there are any products out there that
you've tried in January which you've
absolutely loved any new launches which

I didn't um and yeah do let me know if
