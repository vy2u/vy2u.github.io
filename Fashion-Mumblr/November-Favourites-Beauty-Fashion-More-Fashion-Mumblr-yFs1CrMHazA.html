hi guys and welcome to my new member
favorites video so it's a little bit
later than my usual favourites I think
it's like the second weekend of December
now but things just got a little bit
hectic with my birthday and with vlogmas
and I've been struggling Dex look I've
got like a dog clinging on to my arm so
sorry this video is a tiny tiny bit late
but things were a little bit crazy with
my birthday and with filming vlogmas and
christmas gift guides plus i've been
finding it really hard to actually film
because the lighting is so bad even now
it's just gray and horrible so yeah so
there's a little bit late but I think
this is quite fun favourites video
there's a really big selection of
products
I've got fashion a little bit of beauty
and some kind of like cool giftie things
because a few of them were in fact
presents I was given for my birthday I
really want to kick things off though
with quite a festive thing and is the
nespresso christmas capsules
so every year Nespresso released a
Christmas range and this year I've never
really been that into coffee before but
this year we got an espresso machine and
I've been trying out loads of the
Christmas flavors and I think I think
there's three different ones as vanilla
amaretti I think it's called which to me
just reminds me of those little biscuits
that you get by the side of your coffee
there's also a choco ginger flavor which
I apps that you love I love chocolate
and I love ginger so in a coffee that's
just scrumptious and then the other one
I think is another vanilla I think is
vanilla and cardamom which is a very
kind of warming and definitely the most
festive of the bunch and I love them all
and I've really just been getting back
into drinking coffee and I really love
this mug you probably texture he loves
to chew the capsules no it didn't hide
them
I say hide but he's splitting they're
just gonna go and jump on my bedside
table now and try and get to them but
yeah I've been really just enjoying
having my morning cup of coffee before
we had an espresso machine and I just
used to buy my coffees I'm not a mad Mac
about coffee drinker but I've really
been getting into it recently and also
really really love this mug you've
probably seen quite a few bloggers and
youtubers talking about it because we
work really
I only sent them from benefit but I've
been really loving having my coffee in
this mug in the morning so that's my
first November favorite so I'm going to
do my favorites in order of the things
that Dexter's chewing just to stop him
from shredding all my belongings so the
second one the second one is this hat
which hopefully know which is a white
pom-pom beanie hat and the I think it's
like cashmere and wool but the actual
hat part of it I don't know if you can
see has got my little pearls and just
little crystals sewn onto it which is
just absolutely adorable and I think
this is a raccoon bubble on the top now
this was a gift from my mum for my
birthday and loads of people have asked
her oh it's from but I'm afraid it's
from one of these ladies that sells I'm
not sure if his handmade but she sells
with my Christmas markets in the sari
area so if I do find any contact
NoHo if I do find any contact details
for her then I'll let you know but
otherwise I will try and link some
similar ones down below but I've been
really enjoying getting all bundled up
and wearing this over the past couple of
weeks since I got it and I just think
the colors are really really you know
they're very Christmassy and wintery but
I can definitely wear them in the spring
as well when it's still really chilly so
that's my second November favorite what
are you gonna do next huh what are you
going to chew next I've now got two lip
marks a real one and the gold one and
speaking of lips my next favorite is
this which is a Topshop lip bullet in
the shade in motel I featured this in my
birthday haul so I got it towards the
end of the month I've been pretty much
wearing it non-stop ever since
I'm actually not wearing it today but it
made me realize how similar narrower
you're gonna have to go on a floor you
monkey and but I'm not actually wearing
it today I'm wearing the Elizabeth Arden
lip color in smokey plum which is really
really similar to this the Elizabeth
Arden you know who is above odd and I
stays a little bit more moisturizing but
this is just so so easy to apply it's in
the roll-up bullet which means you don't
have to I don't know like sharpen it
like some
lip crayons the color is just as
beautiful perfect this time of year and
I really love the formula as well it's
not the most long-lasting in the world
but it is a semi matte so not completely
matte doesn't dry out the lips and just
whenever I wear it I find lots of people
ask me what my lip color is which to me
it's always a good sign with with lip
products so yeah really been loving this
I've been throwing it in my handbag I'm
wearing it nearly every single day
another favorite which I might actually
mentioned in last month's favorites but
I've been loving it again this month so
why not mention it twice and it's the
germ alone pomegranate noir fragrance I
went to the gym alone Christmas event a
couple of days ago and they also picked
up a would sage and sea salt which
layers absolutely beautifully with this
so I'm really liking now that I can just
add an even more wintry scent into it
and it's just changed it up a little bit
but still keeping the base notes of this
pomegranate in a while
and I'm sure I've said it so many times
but it's just such a lovely warm and
really kind of familiar scent which I
absolutely love it is telling you just
want to be cozy nothing too sweet and
sharp but this is just such an easy
fragrance to wear and I know it's one of
their best sellers and everybody has it
but I do think it smells different on
everybody which I absolutely love now
the bottles as well I don't think I've
spoken about the packaging before but Jo
Malone packaging is just so stunning
it's just simple classic and it looks so
elegant
I just you just can't fault jo Malone
London fragrances for candles or
anything for that matter so my next
favorite is this makeup bag which says
success is the only option because I
like expensive makeup so this was
actually a gift from the Etsy Secret
Santa so I went to a Christmas lunch
with Etsy or we all did Secret Santa we
had kind of like a budget and we just
got to choose gifts for each other and
obviously I didn't know who bought my
gift the person who's who I bought for
didn't know it's from me but I just
thought whoever chose this to me really
just kind of knew me well and it's just
such a perfect makeup bag so I think the
saying is pretty true I think the desire
to have lovely things is a major
motivator for me keeps me working really
hard it's a great size and it's just
a cool-looking makeup bag stuffing
stuffing it full of all my beauty bits
and bobs and keeping this in my handbag
I did actually find out who my secret
santa was and it's poppy from poppy
didn't see so thank you poppy I
absolutely love my makeup bag there
really is no order to these favorites
I'm just kind of picking stuff up as I
see it it is quite a random selection
but another thing that I've been loving
this month our pillow mists or sleep
sprays and I did a blog post recently on
things that keep you feeling fab during
winter and I did mention sleep sprays
and I really have been just using these
every single night over the past few
weeks and months I'd say maybe past
three months Charlie has been spritzing
our pillows every evening to thigh a
live are the neon perfect night sleep
pillow mist in tranquility and the deep
sleep puss puss puss pillow spray from
this works both of them smell really
really similar I won't be able to smell
them now because I've just put
pomegranate Noir everywhere both of them
smell really lovely both of them do an
incredibly good job I prefer the
packaging of the neon one but the sleep
pillow spray this one comes in really
handy miniature ones which I also got
one in a box or I'll go see what was
can't remember which which is really
really handy for when you're traveling
sometimes I find it really hard to sleep
from not my own bed so really handy to
have a mini in your overnight bag
with these kind of things I never know
if they're a bit of a placebo if they
just make you think that you're gonna
fall asleep more easily and so you do
but either way I finally really work for
me and whenever I spritz my pillow or I
never Charlie spritzes my pillow I find
that I'm asleep within minutes so if
you're one of these people that maybe
lies awake for quite a long time
knitting over silly things not necessary
but that's silly but you know if you
just can't get sleep so you're too many
thoughts running around your mind then
definitely give these a try and they
smell really lovely so it's quite a
calming way to fall asleep and been
loving using these recently okay this is
quite a random one and if you follow me
on snapchat you'll have seen how crazy
excited I got when I saw these in
Primark they are copper coat hangers and
they were five four three pounds and I
must have bought like 20 sets it was a
little bit ridiculous but I'm planning
doing some blog posts about that
clearing out your wardrobe and you know
just fashion spring cleaning those kind
of things but I also just generally
don't like the fact that my coat is all
higgledy-piggledy
I've got Topshop ones wooden ones cough
ones felt ones velvet ones but I thought
I would try and make one would you nice
and neat and tidy and just have copper
ones and you all know how much I love
copper so yeah random favorite
I haven't taken them out of the
cardboard packaging yet because I'm
going to film a Primark a festive haul
and I thought I'd stick these in for
good measure
and then the beauty favorite is the
Hollywood blonde lash edit from earlier
so this is a box set and it contains but
little velcro doors and it contains
three sets of eyelashes you'll notice at
the middle set is missing and that's
because I'm wearing them right now but
I've been wearing a set from this kit
pretty much every time I have something
slightly special on during November and
the first week of December I've got lots
of Christmas dinners and parties coming
up and I just think that this set
contains all the lashes that you need
from the really really wearable everyday
ones at the top the middle ones that
have got on now which are a little bit
more dramatic but still okay for daytime
wearing and then these bottom ones which
are great for in the evenings I just
trim them a little bit so they really
perfectly fit my eye um and because
they've got such a thin band you just
cannot wear them you just cannot feel
them on your eye at all which I
absolutely love I used to hate it back
in the day when I first died wearing
false eyelashes it was so chunky you
could feel like your eyelids were
waiting down by them but these you just
completely forget that you're wearing
them and they look so natural really
easy to apply probably woman like three
nights a week for the past few weeks so
I definitely fight include these in my
favourites because I have been loving
them I've also really been liking the
neon Christmas candles now this one is
their perfect piece candle and it's not
overly festive so if you don't really
like that kind of really festive pine or
or chestnut or berry smell then this
could still be a really lovely option
for you it's definitely um actually
think it is a pieman kind of scented
candle it's a little bit citrusy I think
maybe some lime in there as well and I
don't know what myrrh smells like but
I'm pretty sure I remember
that had murder in it but it's quite
fresh smell a little bit festive but not
overly festive but the jar itself is
really gorgeous it's got these little
silver dots on it and I believe they
have a gold version as well so it looks
really beautiful in your lounge whether
you're going overboard for Christmas or
not it's just really perfectly beautiful
and it smells pretty gorgeous as well
hello again cane is back to terrorise
the video while this little beasties
here I will show you my next November
favorites or should I rather say
Dexter's favorite and it is go for the
coffee
and it is this little jumper which
Charlie's nan actually bought for Dexter
because we noticed that he was shivering
a little bit when we took him to watch
Charlie play rugby
oh he's drinking my company see I told
you those mr. snow caps you look good
based No yes you lick your lips you
monster no and for that I'm putting you
in the jumper there we go so this is
Dexter's gorgeous little jumper it says
little pudding on it and he definitely
is all my yearning little pudding
so yeah Dexter Oh Dexter really really
loves his Christmas jumper it keeps him
nice and cozy doesn't it my little boy
oh just birth for me it's alright always
tired now my babies so yeah Dexter
absolutely loves his jumper so thank you
Charlie's man look he just is absolutely
crazy one minute and then just crashes
out and falls asleep the next minute and
the last few pieces are also birthday
related this one I have to pick up quite
carefully because the numbers for the
signs are falling out but it's this
light box which my mum got me for my
birthday and I have just been obsessed
with using it ever since if you've been
watching my vlogmas then you would have
seen me using this in the intro and it's
just really super because basically
these they move around and it came
with a whole alphabet and some symbols
as well like hashtags hearts all those
kind of things and mum also got me some
kind of sets as well as I've got some
pastel numbers and letters and emojis
one which has got eyelids at Christmas
things and first day things which are
really good fun so yeah if you follow me
on Instagram or have you watched a few
of my vlogs and you'll have seen how
much I have enjoyed playing around with
this this might mess up the lighting I
know it's okay but yeah you can see it
actually lights up which looks
absolutely super and I think I'm just
gonna leave like a nice Christmassy
message on there for when we have our
Christmas jumper party next weekend and
just leave it in the house looking
looking nice and festive but the great
thing is you can just put any message in
there which is great fun so yeah mum got
me that one oh it's full names Oh No
yeah you have to be really careful with
the letters that's the only thing it
should have little Stoppers on the side
that'd be great to stop them sliding out
but I have been loving playing around
with that that one is from not on the
high street I'll leave a link to that
went down below but I think there's also
I have seen one in the window of Urban
Outfitters on Oxford Street so if I can
find them online then I'll leave the
links down below and finally my last
November favorite is this very sparkly
skirt which I got from French Connection
I bought this to wear on my birthday and
I've also worn it to a couple of festive
Christmas things I've got to be really
careful to try and think I've seen it
each event so is not to wear it too many
times in front of the same people but I
just think it's a really lovely very
easy thing to add into your wardrobe to
add a little bit of sparkle and festive
goodness
but it's got the not sequins or maybe
they are but they look a lot more they
look more substantial than sequins but
looking closely they are sequins but
it's this lovely blue silver to gold
ombre effect and it fits really
beautifully I've been wearing this with
black roll necks and a black blouse as
well so it's just a very kind of a chic
way to add a little bit of sparkle into
your festive outfits and I probably
everyone it's about four times slightly
different combinations to different
dinners and different events and such
and yeah I've been absolutely loving
loving and loving this skirt throughout
November
and I think I'll be getting a lot more
use out of it as the Christmas party's
keep on coming over the next few weeks
and that's it guys quite a random
selection of products minor member
favorites but I think quite a fun
selection we've got fashion home beauty
gift ideas or things that I've been
gifted and a dog jumper just thrown in
for good measure
so - joy - diet to die I might boring
you so I hope you guys have enjoyed
today's video and I hope you're enjoying
blog comments as well if you if you've
been watching vlogmas and I've been
really enjoying doing it it's good fun

having the camera like always in your
face in fact it's right here so I can
kind of vlog that I'm but I'm doing a
video but yeah I've been also doing
