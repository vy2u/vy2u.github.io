of a vlogger melon boxing for you guys
today it kick off the vlog hair is a
little bit crazy makeup free because I
thought if there are any beauty products
in this selection and hair products so
then I can give them a go and do a bit
of the first impressions and it is
currently 27 degrees outside so if I
look a little bit glowy and flustered
that is why but without further ado
there is quite a lot of bloggers mail
here because it's since Charlie and I
have been away so let's get straight
stuck in there I always love sharing my
blog amount unboxings with you sometimes
I do them my Instagram stories but I
think it's really nice to on YouTube as
well so gonna get started with this
little red one that's what's inside so
this is the very first flower by Kenzo
jelly perfume I'm intrigued this looks
like the kind of compact that a cushion
foundation would come in and it's
personalized a little jfo is absolutely
adorable so inside this looks identical
to what you would expect a powder or a
cushion foundation to look like and it's
even got a little powder puff so I guess
you just press this down do it a few
times oh yeah and then like a jelly
comes out on the pad that is really
unusual quite refreshing to apply though
so this is an essence of pink pepper
Bulgarian rose and violet as well as
white masks and vanilla I feel like you
need one tiny bit of that absolutely
covered myself in it this would be a
really good thing to have in your
handbag or to travel with very good idea
from Kenzo the next bags that I have is
actually full of wedding stationery from
Kiki Kay I'm not going to lift up the
bags it's quite big but we have some
really fun things in this little
stationery set including this photo
booth set which is such a good idea if
you've got a photo booth your wedding or
if you just want to put some fun props
on your table this has got a little
mustache a little XOXO heart fun things
like that also a big wedding organizer
file this is going to come in very handy
score all the specific sections budget
location for sheet for customizing
wedding guest lift sheet this is amazing
if you are an organization that nerd
like me next I'm gonna open up this
little bag from Dior and fortunately
everything's a little bit crushed
because we had quite a lot of things at
our peer box and they put them in bags
for us and so everything gets a little
bit squished but I'm sure what's inside
will still be absolutely beautiful so
this looks like a collection of things
from their summer range all from the
Dior bronze collection this is an SPF 30
beautifying protective milky mist a
sublime glow that is a very very long
product named SPF 30 is fantastic though
for these super hot days we're having oh
my gosh I feel like that might be kind
of like an aerosol oh so it comes out
like a cream smells oh my goodness that
smells amazing oh and it gives the skin
a bit of a glow as well that would be
amazing on the first day of holiday when
you're not that hand so you want a
little bit of you know shimmer on the
body to be a bit more flattering very
very handy that's gonna come up me on
our next trip and then we also have the
same as the first product that I opened
but this is oh this is actually an oil
in mist in an s care $59.90 luxury Sun
care Thank You Dior next delivery is
from nooks makeup and YX and it's like a
little honeypot and it says Josie LD and
honeypot it's time to get dewy and I
think what's inside is a glowing primer
let's have a look that's really unusual
it comes out like little spatula it's a
little bit goopy like honey as well so
let's see how this feels on the skin
it's meant to keep the skin looking
radiant and fresh all day long which is
exactly what we liked at this time of
year doesn't smell too strong I know
some people don't really like the smell
of honey but that is not overly scent it
doesn't feel sticky on the skin either
so so far so good and my skin does look
nice and radiant it must be the time of
year for glowing primers because I've
also just opened up a bareMinerals
violet
a primer for a naturally lit from within
glow I'm guessing from the name this is
going to have a slight lilac tone to it
which again is really good for color
correcting available this may
exclusively to QVC so let's have a
little look think yeah it comes out with
a very very light lilac color so if
you've got any redness on the skin and
that should get rid of it this has got
much finer and pearlized particles
whereas the honey one from nooks has
slightly bigger particles so this would
be good if you want something a little
bit more subtle next I've got a box from
skunky
spoon spoon see I'm not sure what how to
pronounce that I think it sounds Swedish
not heard of this brand before it says
hi Josie enjoy screen sees latest hair
accessories available from Primark pink
isn't just a colour it's an attitude we
make hand contact before I contact love
it so this oh my gosh there's a cute
little selection of product I've got a
little bkr water bottle very good size
for a handbag powder puffs I think this
might be a scented candle then we have
got the hair bubbles these are
apparently cashmere blend hair bubbles
for ultimate comfort hopefully that
means they won't be snagging the hair
and then also oh that is very handy
ultimate grip hair clip this kind of
thing I actually use an almost daily
basis in fact I'm gonna use this now
because my hair is making me very very
hot oh my goodness the relief when I tie
my hair back
I feel like boys don't know how lucky
they are to have short hair and not have
that feeling of hot sweaty hair along
their backs thumbs up if you agree and
recognize that feeling there's also a
little bath bomb in here and also a no
damage cashmere blend I don't know what
you call these like headbands I guess
you'd be really good for in the gym and
also a couple of oh dear notebooks a
really lovely blogger Mel thank you very
much to scoochie I really hope I'm
saying that right
oh this next one is from it cosmetics we
have got a lovely selection of products
including elastic stretch volumizing
mascara
24-hour waterproof easy guide liquid
super gel liner and a specific eye brush
with a blender and
a slanted brush on the end and also I
transforming anti-aging super palate I
have not heard of an anti-aging so this
is the it cosmetics superhero palette oh
wow that is rather beautiful there are
three different sections so you've got
the Browns you've got the slightly
warmer tones and then the more silvery
blue colors and then you've also got the
base colors at the top that is a really
good idea I feel like if this section
came in its own little palette that
would be the one for me but so nice to
have all of this choice so apparently
this is for brushes in one I'm not quite
sure how that works but it cosmetic
brushes are amazing so let's give it a
try
oh that is so clever oh my goodness so
this pings down to make the brush as
fluffy as you want it so that's the
fluffier setting or you can push it up
if you want something a little bit more
dense what's the great idea I'm gonna
put it to the middle setting to apply my
confidence primer so this is just a
really neutral shade for all over the
lid and then I'm going to use V I'm
going to use the limitless shade which
is a slightly metallic Brown II shade
and then I'm going to use aura just in
the crease area to give a little bit
more definition I'm gonna click this
down to blend it all out and then you
could take the slanted end of the brush
to a darker shade so I'm going to take
the dancing color which is a darkest
Brown and use that as a liner brush so
that's a really lovely selection of
colors I'm not sure what make some
anti-aging they've probably got some
amazing ingredients in there like most
of it cosmetics products then I'm going
to try the superhero elastic stretch
mascara I'm a big fan of it cosmetics
and scorer's so I'm sure this will be
fantastic my lashes feel super naked and
little at the moment because my new ver
lashes have all come out sadly so this
mascara has a huge job to live up to but
it's doing a pretty good job
my Nashes are never going to look
absolutely amazing because they are a
little bit a little bit thin on the
ground after my lash extensions but
that's done a really
good job next up is a delivery from nude
Styx and this is a new launch from them
it says this is their
three-in-one tinted elastic that sounds
very interesting with this time of year
sounds like hopefully it's gonna be a
little bit lighter than a usual
foundation stick and put a couple of new
sticks inside a light medium and a dark
although I think there's loads different
shades so I'm gonna try out this middle
shade tinted blur stick in the shade
light and number three I'm just gonna go
for it and apply this like Oh actually
it is much lighter than I was expecting
thought it was gonna leave me a little
bit stripy I've got a bit of blemishing
around my chin so I'm gonna scribble
that on and then blend it out with a
foundation brush so as you can see
that's just giving me a really light
coverage I feel like if you wanted to
have something in your handbag to top up
your makeup on the go then that would be
really really nice very handy nifty
little container as well next from neon
we have got the supercharged energy
burst body oil with baobab oil and
vitamin C to protect and boost immunity
and the oil provides the skin with
nourishment intense hydration throughout
the day it's always like a lucky dip
with neon product love trying to scoop
the products out of the box so we have
got the luxury body oil in here I can
already tell this is going to smell
absolutely amazing as all neon products
do I feel like this would be a really
good one for when you're traveling as
well keep the skin nice and hydrated oh
my goodness
that smells absolutely incredible oh wow
that is so light that feels absolutely
gorgeous okay that is definitely coming
with me in my suitcase nice to just
pamper the body after their day in the
Sun or a day traveling and it's their
scent to de-stress so you can also get
this sent in a candle in a room diffuser
and they've added vitamin E incre and
inchi oil inside I've not heard of
incheon Inca oil so this is dear Josie
this spring Erin invites you to fill the
room with two Burroughs introducing the
new limited edition Erin to Burroughs
majula
Ellis wok handles radiant by day elegant
by night available
lead to Harrods Selfridges and
st-laurent UK sixty pounds each oh my
goodness
Erin candles are so divine so we have
this beautiful gray box tied up with a
little cream ribbon let's see what's
inside oh my goodness oh wow so they
have presented the candles in real
flowers which unfortunately I've gone a
little bit off since it's been in my
peer box for a couple of days but it
still looks absolutely beautiful look at
that oh my gosh and we've got the two
candles inside hopefully I can salvage
the flowers I think if I missed them
they will come back to life this is
stunning so I actually have the tuberose
loser and they're smart perfumes off on
my shelf over there and they are such
gorgeous fragrances oh my gosh look at
that is that not the most beautifully
presented candle you have ever seen
oh so pretty so I've just opened up
tuberose du jour this is the daytime
scent and I can confirm it smells just
as amazing of the perfumes I've had Erin
candles before and you only have to
light them for 10 minutes and the whole
room smells absolutely and I feel like
they just look so beautiful even just on
your coffee table so that is an amazing
little collection so thank you very much
to Erin for such a beautiful delivery
I'm gonna try soaking these and
hopefully we will revive them Wow
so apparently it's beauty blenders 16th
birthday in May this year I cannot
believe it's 16 those bonkers so I have
a little box here from Beauty Blender
Wow okay that is so clever when you open
it that is so clever and look at this oh
my gosh
whoever comes up with these they have
such a fun job creating all these
amazing little marketing ideas down
inside we have an ode to the original
Beauty Blender with this amazing little
box complete with a mirror in the lid
and when you look in the mirror it gives
you a little tiara how cute is that
we've got the original Beauty Blender
the world's first edgeless makeup sponge
designed to deliver a perfect
blended look oh that is so fun little
beauty queen sash for the Beautyblender
birthday girl what's a fun idea that is
such a lovely blogger man apparently
this year Beach blender is 16 years old
45 thousand Beauty blenders are made
every day 33 hours of beauty blenders
are sold every day
and last year beauty blender shipped
more than twelve million Beauty blenders
Clovelly that is absolutely incredible
no wonder it has stuff around for 16
years obviously I cannot believe this
was around when I was 10 years old why
is I still using between Matt mousse
foundation so I've received from deklay
or a clean air kit from Friends of the
earth apparently this is the first step
towards investigating and tackling air
pollution where you live so it's come
with this little collecting pot so I
guess I have to take a sample of the air
here send it off to them to analyze the
air
I think the findings going pretty scary
because you're always hearing about how
bad the pollution is in London and this
is all to celebrate their hydro floral
ever fresh range which helps protect the
skin from the harmful effects of
pollution this is a light cream with a
really essential oil I love the smell of
neroli so this is gonna be absolutely
heavenly this is the scary fact it says
at the start of 2017
it took London only five days to exceed
its annual air pollution target that is
absolutely disgusting
it says 62% of women suffer from
dehydrated skin
it says deathly or sparse will also
launch an anti-aging anti-pollution
facial in collaboration with Nicola jaws
for protection hydration and radiance
this is going to be 43 pounds 34 percent
saw a reduction in pollution particles
on the skin 83 percent of women found
dehydration lines were reduced that's a
load of information from the press
release for you but that sounds amazing
and let me have a smell yes as predicted
that smells out that you haven't leaked
so I've got a very fun looking delivery
here from the body shop this is to
celebrate their new body yogurts which
apparently are absorbed into the skin in
15 seconds do see peace running oh my
god the whole box smells incredible
super fast absorbing meaning you can go
from shower to jeans in 15 seconds
wowzers so this is the almond milk body
yogurt I was just using the body shop
almond milk scrub in the shower this
morning so so gorgeous 100% vegan and
then we've also got the strawberry body
yogurt I'm going to apply some of this
on my leg and that looks like almost
like a jelly consistency I say a little
bit lighter than a yogurt but oh my gosh
smells so good gonna pop that on my leg
that feels sorry for the sudden camera
angle changed I just had to empty my
memory card because I had been filming
for about an hour and managed to fill up
my memory card I thought I would quickly
show you what my bedroom looks like when
I'm doing a blog amount unboxing because
it is pretty darn scary there are just
packages and products everywhere it's
such a bomb site I'm not gonna lie the
mess stresses me out so much but I'm not
gonna complain because receiving all of
these amazing products is definitely a
perk of the job but I am going to put
you guys back on the tripod and show you
the last couple of pieces I was planning
for this to be the beginning of a vlog
but I feel like the blogger mail has
taken up the entire video but I'm going
to get my nails done after this so I'm
going to take you with me along to that
and then I also have a really fun day
tomorrow so maybe I'll just make this a
super long video because whenever I post
videos that are like 30 to 40 minutes
long you guys seem to really like them
so I will show you what's going on over
the next couple of days after the
vlogger man unboxing so I'm gonna make
this next selection of products as
snappy as possible okay so the last
thing that I was showing you guys was
the body shop body butters or body
yogurts they're called I put this one on
my leg and it smells amazing and it did
sink in straight away so if you don't
like to hang around after putting on
your body lotion definitely give these a
try and the curse tale from the body
shop you know that they have been made
in a sustainable way and no animal
testing a hundred cent vegan so amazing
products smell with divine and they also
put in a rose chewy glow face
mist for hydrating and illuminating and
it's makeup friendly I feel like this is
such a nice thing to use on a hot
summer's day like today and that smells
so good
such a nice thing to have in your
handbag imagine being on a hot sweaty
tube and then spread yourself with this
so so nice okay my next delivery was
from space okay and it says that
launching in store on Wednesday 9th of
May there is a gift with purchase in
