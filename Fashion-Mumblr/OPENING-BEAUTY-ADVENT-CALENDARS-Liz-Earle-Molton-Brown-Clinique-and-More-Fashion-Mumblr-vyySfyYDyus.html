me for today's video which is going to
be my opening beauty advent calendars
video it's my first Christmas video of
the year it feels way too early to be
doing this but it's November and people
are already starting to think about
which advent calendars they want to be
opening next month so I thought I would
open a few for you today to give you a
little bit of a feel as to what is
inside obviously Beauty advent calendars
over the past couple of years have just
gone absolutely crazy there are so many
brands offering Beauty Advent candles at
the moment and it really is quite a hard
choice especially with a huge range in
price they go from around the like 20
pound mark all the way up to the 200
pound mark possibly even beyond and they
do sell out really really quickly so
that's why I'm bringing this video to
you potentially a little bit earlier
than you might expect to see Christmas
content and also these Beauty event
calendars do tend to sell out really
quickly so if there are any that you
really like I'll leave the links to all
of these linked I'll leave the links to
all of these down below and do not hang
about because I would hate for you to be
disappointed and not get the one that
you really want so that further ado
let's get started ok so first of all is
the soap &amp;amp; Glory it's a calendar girls
advent calendar which i think is a
really fun way of doing it this is
available from boots so hopefully really
easy to get your hands on on the day of
filming this video it is still in stock
it's 40 pounds not sure purchase it but
um and I believe that this is actually
available in the boots 3-4 to offer so
you could potentially pick up three
maybe some for your friends as well save
a little bit of money um inside as you
can see it's a really nice big
substantial one very very colorful and
bright on the inside bright pink almost
like a beautiful sequin pattern and then
you've got the vintage pinup dolls that
we associate soap &amp;amp; Glory decorating
inside you're probably gonna hear me
saying this a lot to join this video but
I really love having calendars for
travel minis because it's a little bit
of a rarity when you do get a full-size
product
handers sometimes it's just reserved to
Christmas Day but personally I love just
stocking up my travel minis so great for
popping in your travel bag a sleepover
bag and this one is certainly full of
them so I'm going to go ahead and open
up the date and number 20 to start with
and inside we have got actually this
looks like a really good size this is
their hand food hand cream hand cream is
just a really universally loved products
I don't know anyone that doesn't like
hand cream very nice thing to pop in
your handbag that's a lovely one for day
number 20 and without reopen that
student number eight a slightly
different size oh then we have a makeup
product it's a nice variation you've
probably got some body care I can
imagine so from glory to amazing like
body washes last year I got one of their
body butters which I adore and looks
like they've added some makeup in this
time this is their sexy mother pucker
matte lip 3d lip color in a very
versatile shade so nice that they've
picked a color that will suit everyone
that is in day number eight and then
finally this is quite an unusual shape
I'm not really sure if you can see what
it's like an avocado shape for day
number 15 and let's have a little look
what is in here oh it looks like a oh I
thought it was gonna be face mask but
actually it's a rich and famous shower
and bath body wash very very tiny body
wash I feel like they probably could
have gone a little bit more generous on
the size of giving here because that
literally is enough for one of my legs I
do go quite heavy when it comes to using
shower products but a nice way to try it
out rich and famous so it is in day
number 15 so that's the first one I feel
like a lot of people are going to be
very very happy to receive this it's a
really nice thing to give someone just
before the Christmas period and why not
treat your girlfriend's on the 3-4 to
offer I'm hoping that is actually true
so that's soap &amp;amp; Glory this next one is
much higher price point and is one of
the very luxurious event condors also a
very heavy one this one is from molten
Brown this one is Charlie's personal
favorite too gets very excited for this
every year and opening up his daily
treats it's beautifully presented and
also on that note is a great unisex
event calendar or nice perhaps if you
want one for the family to share really
be to be presented I would definitely be
keeping this box like presentation
opens up with this little magnetic clasp
inside all of the days are individually
numbered it is a little bit like Jenga
or a jigsaw in that when you open one
they all start to fall out so I'm gonna
lie this I'll everything up and show you
and then I'm going to lie it flat on my
nap because last year I could not for
the life of me figure out how to get
them all in again looks like we have a
little body lotion this is their Rosa
absolute well I think is really nice but
Molton Brown is let's be honest pretty
much everybody loves molten Brown
products and I know a lot of people I
don't to say get stuck in a rut but they
have a real favorite so Charlie now I've
been using like narangi for so many
years as has my mum we just absolutely
love it
so this could be a really nice way of
trying out and maybe discovering a new
fragrance heaven forbid your favorite
ever goes out of stock and it's nice to
know which other ones you absolutely
love so this is a little body lotion
let's see what they have in the square
boxes this one feels really heavy this
is number 17 oh my gosh reading this is
a crab door this is a little mini candle
it's the Alang Alang fragrance in this
beautiful deep purple do you call it a
votive I think that's what my cauldrons
are this size it's really nice to just
have tossed about the house in your
bedroom and molten brown ones I always
find the fragrances very very strong so
that's a really nice one let's open up
one more let's go for number five I
can't guess what this is based on the
shape but let's see I think it is a hand
cream once again this could definitely
be a gift for a guy like it's quite
masculine packaging it's there Alba
white truffle hand treatment and I'm
gonna try this now because I'm super
impatient I'm not sure if I've ever
actually tried Mortimer Brown hanging
before but this is actually a really
good size it's probably not their full
full size but when you're spending 165
pounds you do want something a little
bit bigger than just a typical sample oh
my gosh ah smells absolutely heavenly
next up is the first 12 days of
Christmas box and I believe that you're
meant to gift these and then start
opening them on Christmas Day and then
going up to New Year's Day I think
that's right please correct me if I'm
wrong and this is from one of my
favorite skincare brands it is the Liz
Earle 12 days of Christmas box
inside it is a selection or
individually boxed treats and I
personally think this is a really good
gift to give someone that is already
perhaps to cleanse and polish van so
many people absolutely swear by that
cleanser but maybe they want to discover
something else from the range this is a
really nice way of helping them decide
what else they want to try once again
I'm going to open up a couple and show
you what is inside so this is day number
six let's see what's in here
quite a small product but this would
still probably get two maybe three or
four uses it is there liselle intensive
nourishing treatment mask I'm not sure
if I've tried this one before I've tried
quite a few lazar face masks absolutely
love all of them but one thing that is
good about these smaller sizes is that
nestle does contain naturally active
ingredients so you're not going to need
to worry about leaving something open
for too long I do get quite conscious of
my face masks especially if they're in
quite an open container and my little
night cream it is such a ginormous pot
but I do sometimes worry about the
active ingredients because the pot is
open for quite a long time but you don't
have that stress with these which is a
bonus so you've got a lovely face mask
out to detox the skin after food induced
pimples came here over the Christmas
period next this one's quite big it's
day number two let's see what's in here
I think this is the classic cleanse and
polish in a slightly smaller size to the
usual but still fairly substantial this
is so many people's favorite skincare
product I keep going back to this time
and time again no matter how many trends
as I try this is one I always go back to
maybe if you've got a friend that hasn't
tried rizal yet they would very much
appreciate this and this will help them
and see what all the hype is about
finally let's open day number three this
is a really long one very light not sure
what's in here looks like as some
cleansing cloths not the most exciting
thing to open but a necessity
nonetheless so you get the cleansing
cloths in day number three this box is
66 pounds you can get it on those
different websites and John Lewis is a
good one to get from and again still in
stock personally I think just a really
really lovely gift if you know someone
that's obsessed with skincare or already
Lazar fan and this is a really good
idea next up this is a really fat one it
is from death layer and I think this is
a really great value one I think what's
inside this is worth well over 200 220
pounds but it retails for only 65 pounds
which I think for a evident condor from
a brand as luxurious as deklay all and
one as big and beautiful as this I
actually think that's a really good
price last time I checked they've not
sold out but this one does sell very
very fast so I wouldn't delay if you
want to treat yourself to this or treat
someone else to this inside you have 24
products absolutely gianormous when it's
open 24 products that will help you get
pampered and ready for the festive
season so let's open up date number 19
to start up let's see what's inside this
looks like a little mini a little sample
of the oh it's one of those serums
smoothing oil serum this I have a little
bottle up on my bed and is so gorgeous
what I love about deklay or products is
this smells so so good I have to say a
little disappointed at how tiny this is
when it came in such a big window
definitely expecting something a bit
bigger but then I guess that's why at 65
pounds but still a lovely lovely product
and then the less great way to try it
out and maybe you will want to invest in
the full-size let's go for day number
two day number four very smaller window
inside we have got another very small
one our mesons neroli hydrating night
balm this would be a good one to take on
an airplane with you I always like to
put night creams on when I fly find it
really hydrating for my skin but yeah
quite small when I hope there's some
bigger ones in here um
what feels heavy this side does feel
quite heavy I'm going to open up day
number 16 here we go
much bigger we have what looks to be a
full-size hand cream I have not tried
deadly or hand cream before and but
overall I hope to your door the brand
they have so many nice serums oils face
masks things like that so this is a
lovely gift for someone who is already a
fan of the brand or you think just
deserves a little bit pampering around
Christmas time okay I'm only going to
mention this one very brief leaks it is
actually sold out online but I do
believe there are a few more left in
stores and is the boots number 7
thank candor this one retails for 40
pounds but it's worth over 160 so you
are getting a lot of great value beauty
products inside I'm guessing it's going
to be all number seven and which I'm a
big fan of their makeup removers then my
Silhouette is I absolutely adore ooh
this one says your number seven match
made gift invitation that's interesting
so on the 14th of December discover your
perfect bronzer shades designed to
complement your skin tone redeem your
gift imitation in store and take home
your perfect number 7 match my bronzer
that's such a really nice idea initially
I was like please don't let this be just
an invitation for a makeover which is
probably free in store anyway but you do
get to take home a bronzers that's a
really nice idea and very clever and
Boots driving people into the store and
no doubt people end up buying a lots
more while they are in store as well
generally I just think these are such
good marketing ploys as well brands
attend you are very very wise oh if Dana
Burnett 21 is a makeup brush and that
feels absolutely gorgeous I've not tried
number 7 makeup brushes before it's not
really a brand that I automatically
think of for makeup brushes so that's a
nice little discovery good size for if
you've got a makeup pack in your handbag
for daily like top ups on the tube or
whatever really nice size and let's see
what is behind door number 15 this looks
like a little eye shadow I don't know if
I'm gonna be able to get that out I'm
not very good at prodding things out but
as you can see a little eye shadow in
there
lovely neutral shade good for maybe all
over the eyelid and in the corners to
brighten up the eye area so a nice
addition to your festive makeup
collection next up is one that I get
very excited about every year and it is
the bodyshop advent calendar so they
always have a variety to choose from
ranging in price from 45 pounds I think
one of them is 65 and then this one is
99 pounds the value of what's inside is
so much more often double the cost of
the advent calendar itself the body shop
as a whole I just absolutely adore if
you guys haven't seen it I went to India
with the body shop earlier this year
feels like forever ago to learn about
their community trade which are
celebrating 30 years of this year they
do really am
things and it's just amazing that you
can support that by buying something so
fabulous this Christmas let's have a
peek what's inside I think it's gonna be
little individual drawers yes another
Jenga one so this is what it looks like
inside so many beautiful individually
boxed products and it looks like they're
all gonna be pretty big too so let's
have a little nosey little box here it's
chilly outside treat someone to a hot
drink it says on the box and we have
cast a little what is this it's some of
their glitter makeup I think glitter
dust for any Christmas parties you got
coming up quite small for a big box but
we will forgive them number ten oh it's
got like a little Q&amp;amp;A on it what is the
average lifespan of an Asian elephant
mmm I mean I guess 90 years ah 60 is
proudly still not bad going the Asian
elephants inside here once again really
big box for not a very beautiful product
it is star stamp liner this is I think
it's a black eyeliner looks like it
could be a double-ended liner
okay and that's also open day number 12
another big box let's hope it's third
time lucky we have got another small
product mmm okay this is a makeup brush
I say a small product and act
disappointed but actually these probably
retail for about 12 pound each so you
are still getting a good value for money
and it is full size so credits already
shop for that this is their cruelty free
of course and makeup brush so all of
these bits so far that I've opened up
are all makeup I'm going to open up one
more and hopefully it might be like a
body butter or something let's go for
day number 23 really big box inside we
have got a full-size almond milk and
honey body butter this is probably my
favorite fragrance actually I had one of
these with me when we went to the mall
DS after going to India with the body
shop and this fragrance will just always
remind me of that trip it is so heavenly
oh my gosh if you love the smell of
honey then this is just divine I feel
like everybody loves a body shop body
butter so to open up a full-size one of
those on
day number 23 it's a lovely treat oh
that is so nice I've just read what's
written inside one of the doors and it
says this Christmas were changing need
to play it forward with our 25 day
game-changing event calendar each day
will set you a task to help make the
world a better place because this advent
calendar takes giving to the next level
once you've completed your challenge it
turns into a board game so you can turn
your luck up putting the world back
together again oh my gosh that is so
lovely so for example every single day
it has a little thing that you can do to
brighten up someone else's day
this one says keep nature feeling chirpy
by feeding the birds so that's just
that's a really have the idea I didn't
notice that before so I'm gonna have a
look at some of the other and nice
things to do you don't have to have the
calendars to do this you can do it any
way put pen to paper and write someone a
thank-you note a nice way to bring a
smile to someone's face so I've had a
little bit of a technical glitch as you
can tell I'm now filming this on my
vlogging camera I have just lost half an
hour's worth of footage and I don't know
where it's gone I think my camera just
stopped filming and I still have six
advent calendars to show you all of
which I've just filmed um
no in Dickens trying to jump all this
over behind me and ethically failing and
yeah I just filmed it all and it's gone
so I'm going to whiz through the last
six advent calendars so I wanted to show
you I also have text on my lap I wanted
to go through the clinic one this is one
I look forward to every single year it's
a mixture of skincare and makeup
products inside the doors that I opened
a second ago we have the toner this is
part of their three-step routine which
is a really really lovely skincare
routine very thorough for me it was
actually my first proper skincare
routine so this I will always think very
fondly of and so that's a great size
probably would last a couple of weeks at
home up here we also have a little mini
of the take day of cleansing oil this
one is a really light cleansing oil very
nourishing but also very effective and I
also opened up number nine which has a
little mini Moisture Surge these are
three iconic Clinique products so if you
are a fan of the brand and you want some
top ups absolutely perfect for that so
this one is still in stock on the day of
filming so do not hang around for the
Clinique one okay I've propped the
camera up which hopefully should make
things a little bit easier
next is L'Occitane and this one
opens down ways and it has lots of
little drawers I actually love locks 10
minutes just especially their hand
creams and the ones that I opened up
previously those little hand cream a
little mini of the drying cream which
for me is a really good tube of
Charlotte Tilbury some magic cream lots
of very good quality products in here
and then the other one that I opened up
I will never be able to find them again
because basically they're all
individually wrapped in the drawers so
it's really nice to get to actually
unwrap the tissue paper just like
opening a gift every single day the
other one that I opened up when I
previously filmed was a little mini of
their cleansing oil which I used all
throughout someone else traveling is
really good for nourishing my quite
dehydrated skin when I was flying quite
a lot during summer months so it's a
really lovely one from L'Occitane I
think L'Occitane is a really nice one
for mums maybe any auntie's grannies
sisters I think it's just a really
lovely one to give as a gift
so another favorite from me we then have
bareMinerals this one is 24 products
again there were quite a few lip glosses
that I opened up the first time a few
different shades there was a pink one
from the Jen nude collection and that
whole launch I was a huge fan of this
year it's really beautiful inside as
well it's like metallic gold absolutely
beautiful and so we have a few lip
glosses not quite full size but I never
really use up a lip gloss so it doesn't
bother me too much that's another lip
gloss and they're more of a coral color
we see in my Dexter is likely on
mountain goats and then here we have a
mini of their serum so not everyone
knows that bare minerals also do
skincare this is our skin longevity
longevity vital power infusion serum
really nice way to try out their
skincare I can tell you it's amazing I
think I could just live off their
mineral skincare big that we have the
Clinique 12 days of Christmas this is a
really lovely one to keep the excitement
going after Christmas day has passed
lots of amazing amazing things in here
and probably the most beautiful and
festive I think and I think it's a
really lovely thing to have on display
in the house that is upside down
um but yeah a really beautiful one to
look at as well as the pieces inside
down
here you actually have a candle and this
to me is just like the ultimate luxury
smell it is seriously gorgeous even
without lighting it makes this whole box
smell delicious number 12 is an instant
light natural lip Perfector even if you
don't like lip glosses this product is
incredible I feel like all the products
in this advent calendar are quite iconic
ones that everyone will like which is
definitely great because I was heat
these are probably gonna be given as
gifts and then this one I didn't
actually open previously but it looks
like a full-size mascara the instant
light lip Perfector it's also full size
this is their intense black mascara I'm
a huge fan of clarence mascaras
especially their waterproof ones i think
it's called the Trulie or the ultra
waterproof mascara is like the most hard
wearing non budging mascara in the whole
world so big fan of that this one I
think is selling really well already so
not want to hang around on if you want
to give this as a gift to someone this
Christmas we then have feel unique and
this one is only 35 pounds so really
really good value and its really nice
before trying out some beauty brands
that potentially you may not have tried
before I opened up number one and this
is a little highlighting tube tester not
quite estrous bit bigger than that from
a brand called Innoko and they are an
organic beauty brand it's really nice to
try a new brand that potentially may not
have heard of before there was also a
natural and organic eyeliner pencil in
here and instead it was particularly
good people with sensitive skin
sensitive eyes and I have a friend that
has very teary eyes when she my makeup
so I'm definitely going to give that one
to her other brands and here are some
classics like NYX you've got Elizabeth
Arden in here too so a really nice way
of getting some top ups of brands you
already love and I'm potentially trying
some new ones too and then I've kind of
saved the best till last this is
actually my favorite advent calendar I
love Elemis as a brand it's one of my
favorite skincare brands I just love
their Pro College marine cream I've
enough their night creams I love their
eye serum I'm a huge fan and I actually
had a facial at the house of mercy of
the day and it was bliss it also he ever
in London then highly recommend this is
the a pink
and it is a very high quality of
encounter the box is made it's very
sturdy material it's not it's more than
cardboard and it's really really lovely
and then you've got individually boxed
products inside I'm going to pop it on
my lap because if this falls down and I
drop it it's gonna be a nightmare
inside the boxes I'm not going to open
too many because as I said this is round
two but you do get some great sized
products inside I think there are a few
full sized pieces in that which is why
it does have that price tag I think it's
165 pounds but then you do get some
really good size minis - this is the
pro-collagen cleansing balm if you've
not tried this before oh yeah you've not
tried this before it is a gorgeous
cleanser so luxurious it's definitely
like a pampering experience just to
cleanse your skin with this and the
funnel unlike lizzo where you get the
flannels they have a day to themselves
this actually comes in the same little
box as the cleanser you will definitely
have glowing skin for Christmas if you
are using all of these lovely products
in the lead-up to Christmas Day so this
one I think is my personal favorite I
would definitely be looking forward to
opening up these in the Advent days
coming up so that's all the Condors that
I have to show you I would love to know

you would most like to be opening up
