me for another beauty advent calendar
unboxing video I've managed to get hold
of one two three four five six seven new
advent calendars since I filmed the last
one and I wanted to share with you my
thoughts and opinions on these and open
up a few days because they are this year
there's such an investment and there is
so there are so many to choose from but
hopefully these videos will help you to
make the right decision if you do francy
picking up an advent calendar as I said
last time there are just so many
available I feel like every brand has
hopped onto the Beauty advent calendar
bandwagon this year I actually think is
a really good marketing ploy so if I was
around I probably would do the same but
yeah it's a really nice way as well to
try out some new products and it's fun
to open up something every day leading
up to Christmas before we get started we
obviously just have to talk about my
jumper it says Dex and through the snow
and it has got a sequin sausage dog on
it and yeah it's basically my spirit
Christmas jumper love it so much and
this was from Shaun and Fred it just go
so nice and affordable as well I am
going to get straight stuck in there as
of the day of filming these calendars
are all still in stock and but they do
tend to sell out really quickly so if
you're interested I would recommend not
hanging about I will leave the links to
where you can buy all of these in the
description box down below so as always
just click show more for all the info
alright let's get started with the one
that I'm really really excited to look
into and it is the Selfridges beauty
advent calendar now I had it in my head
last year that this was really expensive
and it's still expensive is 70 pounds
but I thought it was going to be more
this is also value to the products
insider valued at 250 pounds which i
think is rather incredible we all know
the drama that has been going on
recently with a certain YouTube advent
calendar where the products inside have
been worth not very much but yeah this
one has a really great selection of
products inside I have had a look on the
website and some really luxurious brands
really nice to try out some new brands
and let's be honest it's the Selfridges
advent calendar so it's a really lovely
gift too inside so it's this giant gold
box and it opens up like a big book and
then you've got this fabulous
goal
calendar going right up to 24 inside as
I did in my previous video which if you
haven't seen it yet I opened up loads of
advent calendars ranging from Liz Earle
bareMinerals
The Body Shop I'll leave that one linked
up on the screen and down below so catch
up on that one as well but as I did in
that one I'm just going to open up a few
doors show you what is inside I'm
intrigued by this big one number 19 so
let's have a peek in here I like that
they're like proper doors they're not
the ones we have to pierce the material
so actually you could reuse this if you
wanted to inside this is from cover FX
this actually looks like it could be a
full size product owner maybe now this
is a mattifying primer with anti acne
treatments I've not tried this before it
says it's got 1% salicylic acid which
obviously helps to prevent and heal
blemishes I've currently got quite a few
little under the skin bumps on this side
of my face so hopefully this will be a
good one who tried to heal that
mattifies instantly reduces oil I like
some of this and I always find a little
primers are so good for putting in my
holiday makeup bags otherwise I just end
up forgetting so I don't want to take a
big private with me so that's a lovely
one to discover on the 19th of December
just giving it all away it's also nice
that when you have got your gift out of
the door you can shut the door and it
doesn't leave it looking all messy so
it's going to look fabulous the whole
time it's open throughout the Christmas
period let's look in door number three
Oh
rhodiola rosea is fairly pricey and this
is a very good size this is they're
super acids extreme yeah extreme acid
rush peel the ultimate peel with a
hundred percent active Azalea acid
glycolic lactic lactic and fruit acids
and probiotic technology that is one
heck of a mouthful and but peels are
really good for keeping your skin
glowing at this time of year so if you
can hear a noise by the way dextran
Dickens are currently battling down by
the fire that's their favorite position
we've got the fire on can you hear that
and they do this thing where they don't
fight each other they both have their
mouths open and they're like ah but
they're not really fight each other
Claire please handsome boys so yes this
is a really good way of keeping your
skin glowing throughout winter
especially if you are being a bit
naughty with what you eat and that can
sometimes need your skill skin to be a
little bit dull also add to that like
cold winds hot central heating in the
house winter is a nightmare the skin and
peels are a great way of keeping that
glows that's a really nice one also a
great way to discover the product
without spending a fortune on the whole
range nice discovery elements let's have
a look inside door number eleven it's a
spherical one so I'm quite intrigued to
see what product would be in there
that's how much just a lid looks like an
EVE long style container
oh I guessed it correctly it is the eve
long cleanser I don't think I've tried
their little pot cleanser before I have
tried their primers which are really
nice and moist arises but not their
cleanser so this will be really nice
discovery for me as well looks like a
barmy cleanser that smells like
chamomile I bet it's there calm I'll
cleanse up warm a small amount of the
cleanse between your fingers and use
circular motions ah that smells so so
nice I think evil on is fairly natural I
don't mean it's totally natural but that
certainly smells like it has definitely
got the power of the botanics in there
definitely a good one to try if you do
like slightly more natural skincare and
cleansing balm is just a very luxurious
thing to use at this time of year as
well so that's a lovely one and a good
size a good enough size to trial it for
a couple of weeks and then maybe you can
purchase Dickens just run it into the
tripod and then maybe you could purchase
the full-size one if you find yourself
absolutely loving it so I'm going to pop
that back I'm gonna open one more in
this one because I'm having it so much
fun I'm going to open up number 13 oh oh
wow this is definitely full size we have
got the it cosmetics brow power I've
tried this before and it is really
really good product right there Dicky
and I think they only do this in one
color I believe and it's just universal
it works for every brow shade it suits
everybody I've got quite light brows and
it still works for me it works for
friends they've got really dark hair and
it lasts a really long time so that's a
great products and
that retails for like I think fifteen
pounds so if you think we're getting 24
gifts all of which already a good value
it's not surprising that it comes up to
a value of 250 so I am very pleasantly
surprised with this one as I said it is
currently still available it will be
linked down below don't hang around
because I'm surprised this hasn't sold
out yet so yes that is these Selfridges
Beauty up in Canada for 2017 next I'm
grouping these two together because
they're both from the same brand I don't
know of any other brand that does two
but CRA have bought out two Christmas
Beauty event canvass this year the 12
days and 24 days I'm going to look in
the 24-day advent calendar comes in a
plastic sleeve oh I've already taken
that off and then inside it looks like
this I seem to have instruction leaflet
or something in there there we go
so we've got 24 I believe and I think
it's 25 24 little boxes and the plastic
covers are there so that everything
doesn't fall out when you open it which
can be a real pain in the butt it's it's
like a jigsaw puzzle trying to put these
things back together so I'm going to pop
this on my lap and open up a couple I
don't think it'll be 24 nail varnishes
there might be some like glitter
stoppers some treatment gels that kind
of thing but inside door number seven we
do have a classic festive nail polish
this will go really well with what I'm
wearing at the moment actually um fairly
good size as well I don't know about you
but I never finish nail varnishes they
easily go gloopy or I just get bored of
the color and I take it to a charity
shop or something but I never finish
them so the size of this really doesn't
bother me it's pretty good size 5 mill
this one is called Beach please love
that this would be a good size to take I
know I say this every time but take on
holiday with you
don't want to take a full-size nail
varnish or if you're just taking hand
luggage that would be very useful I'm
also going to open up door number 3
because it's quite an unusual size so
I'm intrigued to know what this is I
think it is another nail varnish this is
gel ology top coat so ciatÃ© do this
range where it really does
make your nails look like you're wearing
gels but you can do it at home really
easily and this is the topcoat
it doesn't require I believe I don't
think it requires a UV lamp I'm pretty
sure it doesn't because you wouldn't
have that in a calendar and that does
make your nail finest lasts a lot longer
and makes them nice and shiny so that's
a really good one to answer your
collection day number 18 next oh my gosh
that is my shade totally that is
beautiful this one is called maybe baby
I'm going to show you close-up as you
can see from the close-up that is just
like absolutely my dream color a
beautiful pinky brownie nudie again
really great way of trying out colors
maybe that you're not used to wearing if
you don't usually wear nudes then this
could start a new obsession very
dangerous note to self
you need to make sure I get myself a
full size of maybe baby so obviously
those three that I've opened are all
nail varnishes but I've just checked the
back and it says that they do have nail
stoppers in there just sprinkle them
onto white now vanish for sparking
finish there's a nail superhero in there
as well which is a treatment gel and I
think also a nail file as well so that's
a really nice gift set just anyone they
don't need to be obsessive nail varnish
I think everyone likes painting their
nails and that's a really lovely
selection ok so this one the twelve days
of Ciotti London and Christmas this is
full their makeup range because of
course the arcade you can make up as
well as nail varnish let's have a little
look inside yeah those similar style you
open the booklet up and then you've got
the days only twelve is time on this
side let's have a look what is behind
door number twelve or inside box number
five hose reading five and saying twelve
this is their Wonder wand gel kohl liner
so about that it's gel makes me think
it's going to be nice and soft on the
eyes a nice classic shade is this black
or brown I think this is black so really
nice classic product that everybody I'm
sure we'll get to use out off I don't
like it when they stick really crazy
colors in there like who necessarily is
gonna wear a green eyeliner day number
four home is where your makeup stash is
a little quote on there we've got
something very beautifully wrapped up
and it
is oh so this looks like a little eye
shadow if I show you that close-up thumb
time done again a really beautiful very
wearable shade I'd say this is like a
rose gold II Capri shimmery shade lovely
for the festive season if you open it up
on the 4th hopefully that's before your
Christmas parties you can have a nice
shimmering eye looks to wear day number
seven next and it's a long thin box
inside oh my gosh this is one of my
favorites probably actually my favorite
CRT maker product it is that liquid
velvet look at that shade that is so
it's so beautiful that is my dream nudie
pink color it is the shade delight that
is such a gorgeous color
I feel like throughout the festive
season throughout the year such a
wearable shade and then liquid Velvets
are so gorgeous oh my goodness I'm so
happy that that's in there and a really
nice size but handbag to not quite full
size but a very good size that's amazing
that has really impressed me so a really
lovely one I feel like see on say makeup
is very very fabulous and if you know
anyone that that loves makeup this is a
really nice option for them twelve days
of Christmas calendars are traditionally
opened after Christmas between Christmas
and New Year so this could make a really
lovely stocking filler to this next one
is one that a lot of you asked me to
review in this video and it is the Marks
and Spencers advent calendar this one
last year is actually my favorite for so
many reasons I think that it's a really
good price it is 35 pounds when you
spend 35 pounds in store which let's be
honest is so easy just get your wrapping
paper stocking fillers not food but yeah
it's very very easy to spend 35 pounds
in M&amp;amp;S who doesn't love M&amp;amp;S just stock
up on thermals I am always wearing one
I'll leave a link to my thermals down
below by the way because they're the
best things ever and I talk about them a
lot I get a lot of questions about them
they're Marks and Spencers anyway back
to the Condor it's quite an unusual
style this year a little bit different
way of doing it with these little boxes
it is a house shape last year I think it
was a treat and if you're not careful
they all fall out so I'm gonna open this
on its side just take this plastic cover
way
and let's start with box number 1717 is
one of my lucky numbers alrighty so in
here we have something from Ren Ren is a
fabulous skincare brand and also a
fairly pricey one so that's nice to see
a luxury brand in there this is their
instant firming Beauty shot I think this
is one of those products you can use
basically whenever your skin just needs
a little bit of a pick-me-up you can use
it before you put on your moisturizer as
like a primer or you can even Pat it on
your skin over makeup so really
versatile product definitely one that
you could get very addicted to so a good
idea from M&amp;amp;S Beauty to pop this in
there because who knows you might become
addicted and start buying the full price
eminence Beauty has so many incredible
brands and this is a really nice way of
discovering them these little doors as
well I have to say are absolutely
adorable each of them is like a little
house and they're just very beautifully
and tastefully decorated so I would say
I'm a big fan of this design next I'm
going to take out one from the bottom
layer this feels quite heavy this is
door number 12 ok this is a pretty good
size product inside Wow ok so we have
got the alpha H liquid gold rose Limited
Edition this is a really great product
so the liquid gold is you would use it
in place of a toner for resurfacing the
skin like I mentioned with the rhodiola
product from the Selfridges up in Canada
this is just an iconic like so many
beauty lovers are obsessed with this and
again a really great size to try it out
this again is a fairly pricey product so
to get it within a 35-pound
event and I think is incredible now I'm
going to shuffle my way through to the
back row we've got some more tall houses
in the back inside day number 13 and
let's have a look this is blood orange
natural spray fragrance I don't know if
this is a room spray or a body spray
from a brand called Shay and blue again
I'm not too sure actually this is a
perfume or room spray oh wow that is
very orange e that's quite unusual very
fresh I think that's actually a perfume
that is too nice to be a room spray
great size for traveling and that is
actually a really low
you smell I guess it's quite festive
because it's oranjee but I would
probably wear that for springtime I've
not heard of this Shane blue brand
before and boutique perfumery so that's
a really nice discovery great thing
about this calendar if the eminence
Beauty have so many nice brands probably
something you've not tried before that's
a nice way of discovering something new
so that's a little bit of a sneak peek
into the M&amp;amp;S beauty a pink panda looking
at the back we also have an Emma Hardy
cleansing balm that's amazing and looks
shower oil you've got roe deal again and
look good feel back to sculpting sponge
REM stealer pur cosmetics balance me
Diego della Palma Leighton Denny who's
Rosie for autograph person Reed pixi by
petra there are some incredible brands
in this and I just can't get over what
great value for money it is so many nice
brands to discover it's not going to
break the bank and M&amp;amp;S are really good
at ordering the right amount
so hopefully having said that this'll
still be in stock again don't hang
around treat yourself
treat anyone that you know I think you
can only buy maximum of three and one go
but yeah highly recommend this and it is
available online as well so links will
be down in the description box ok this
one I'm really really intrigued to look
into it myself it is I believe a
newcomer I don't think they had one last
year it's the Amazon Beauty I think
under there are 24 days inside you get a
lot of amazing beauty products Amazon
isn't somewhere I started with you think
of buying my beauty products but maybe
this will change that the way that it's
laid out you don't have to search around
you can see one two three at the bottom
then it just kind of shuffles down to
the next day so I'm gonna lie this flat
because otherwise it'll totally ruin the
order up let's have a look in day number
one this is also available on Amazon
Prime's you can get it literally the
very next day or maybe even the same day
I don't know if that's still doing that
let's see this looks like a hand cream
this is yes a Crabtree and Evelyn
full-size hand cream it is the 25 gram
ultra moisturizing hand therapy to Rocco
orange that sounds like a really lovely
scent and
I was looking for some hand cream this
morning so I'm going to try this out
with eucalyptus and sage it says on the
packaging oh that smell amazing that's
really lovely way to kick things off
with a nice quality hand cream day
number two next this is a very light one
aha inside we have got a very useful
product this is a brow brush it looks
like it's got a spoolie on one side and
the slanted brush on the other side for
filling in your brows with powder or gel
wherever you prefer wonder brow dual
precision brush these are not cheap and
if you're getting 24 gifts that are of
this value ish then that means this
advent calendar is pretty good value
high-tech beauti perfect Rosen under two
minutes that is very very handy the
anastasia version of that I think is
like 20 pounds so and day number three
let's have a look what is inside here
well again really good size this is from
one of my favorite brands rituals a
purifying ceremony for bullion solve the
ritual of hammam this is their foaming
shower gel is there anything more fun
than a foaming shower gel I love them
really great for shaving too and just
generally pretty nice experience Charlie
really likes this range actually so if
you don't want to keep all these PG
products for yourself then you could
treat your boyfriend and yeah great size
great for traveling but you knew I was
going to do that let's have a look at
one more because I'm really enjoying
this this is day number six oh another
another brand that Charlie really likes
this is James Reed it's his gradual tan
sleep mask tan face so this I've
actually tried it it's amazing you
basically put it on at night to wake up
with an amazing glow and it's mainly the
kind of thing that you wouldn't
necessarily think of buying even if you
are a fake tan lover because it's a
sleep mask it's a little bit more
unusual so that's why it's so nice to
get a mini sized in the Amazon Beauty
event calendar that's really good to
know as well that you can buy this on
Amazon so I know what are we doing after
this checking out all of that lovely
brands so that is a little glimpse
inside the Amazon Beauty I think and a
really nice entry to the market as far
as I'm aware this year kind of sure
people would be very happy to receive
this it's got on the side it's got se eu
array but it is hiding very m balanced
me bourgeois dr. lip and I can't touch L
net loads of amazing brands and products
in there so yeah gets the seal of
approval from me two more to show you
the penultimate of which is the Jack
Wills beauty advent calendar this one is
available from boots it's also part of
their three for two offers so that's
pretty good I think this retails for
fifty pounds which is quite a lot
hopefully it's Giovanni for 25 day
calendar let's have a look okay this is
pretty substantial actually and lots of
doors inside does go to 24 which is
great one thing I would say is I don't
think of Jack Wills as a beauty brand I
think of it as a fashion brand I do
really like that fashion you can kind of
tell that they just wanted to get
involved in the whole advent calendar
Fang and decided to make it a beauty one
which hopefully wouldn't disappoint any
fans of jackals fashion and nice to
discover their beauty let's have a look
how wonderful the products are inside
I'm going to open up day number six this
is English velvet body wash fairly
good-sized I mean this will probably be
three showers I would say nice for a
little long weekend away I'm English
fellow at that sounds really lovely I've
not tried any Jack Wills Beauty before I
can't actually tell what that smells
like because my hand cream smells so
strong but I'm sure it's lovely
as I said yeah I've not tried any Jack
Wills Beauty before but this is a really
nice way of doing so let's have a look
in door number nine this is this is a
body scrub I must say I'm really liking
the packaging on these it's very sleek
and simple almost a little bit glossy
yes you could say just the fact that
it's quite um simple and sophisticated
but yeah body scrubs always come in very
handy let's have a look behind door
number four they all seem to be in the
same kind of size tubes oh this is
another body scrub English velvet maybe
they're running out of ideas let's try
something else
door number 14 this is
think of nail varnish okay I actually
cannot get this one out without totally
running the box but as you can see it's
a little gold festive nail varnish close
up so that you can actually see it there
we go
five mil which is a pretty good size so
if you are getting 24 of those fairly
good size products and I guess value for
money is not too bad working out about
two pounds of product I guess for like
younger fans of Jack Wills I know that
there is a big hype around this brand
when I was like 16 I was obsessed with
it I would only wear like my Jack Wills
hoodie my denim miniskirt my ugg boots
total would you call him do you used to
call him Araya it's not just me yeah
that was that was what I was when I was
little and I used to love Jack Wills as
someone who does love the brand for
their clothes I don't know if I would
necessarily choose to opt their beauty a
pink Conda but if you were just in love
with the brand as a whole then I think
this is a pretty good value
I think counter I told you it was 50
pounds earlier and I've just seen on the
back that it says 35 pounds that's even
better even better value works out like
just over a pound 20 per day so yeah not
bad at all last but not least we have
another nail varnish Beauty event
calendar and this is from a brand called
mavala they are a Swiss brand and I love
their products the nail varnishes
themselves are quite small anyway so
it's quite likely that these are going
to be full-sized looks really cute it's
not a terribly festive colored one it's
quite so whether colors actually there's
like turquoise and pink ribbon but
really really pretty inside it says
you've got given the game wagon here
oil seal dryer for an instant touch dry
manicure that sounds good
tweezers six nail polishes hand cream
base coat cuticle oil so a really nice
selection for someone who's very much
into that manicures I love in its little
drawers as well I think it makes it so
fun like if you are parents or friends
giving this to a daughter or a friend
you could definitely add things to it
like you could put little notes in or
you can put some sweets in or little
bits of jewelry or whatever you could
totally DIY this
so inside drawer number nine we have
very festive nail color this is 210 red
diamonds this is a perfect Christmas
nail varnish red sparkly there's a
little close-up for you absolutely
perfect this would make a really nice
top coat as well if you want to do maybe
white nails with gold sparkly a red
sparkly accent nail really fun to do
things like that and again that the size
is perfect for doing that kind of thing
day number two we have color fix topcoat
so this is a solution that you can put
over the top to help make your nails dry
quicker and make your nails last longer
really handy thing to add to your
manicure collection and then let's have
a look day number six this is another
non nail varnish but very useful product
this is their protective base coat
prevents nails from yellowing and
extends the life of nail polish very
very handy I think this is a great gift
for someone that does take their nail
painting quite seriously if you know
someone that does a lot of their
manicuring at home I think this is a
really great event calendar so that's a
little closer for that one you can see
it's some pretty much I think this is
full size as well this is a size that
they sell my mom is actually obsessed
with this brand I think they do my
violin manicures at her spa and she's
always going on about the incredible
quality of them so a really nice gift to
give someone again it is the 12 days of
Christmas so it could be a lovely
Christmas present
and great products inside so what more
do you want so that's it for my beauty
advent calendar unboxing video I really
hope you enjoyed working through them
with me and hopefully by now you will
have a really good idea as to which one
you would like to treat yourself to or
