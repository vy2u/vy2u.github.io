video today's video is going to be quite
a Jersey and OH chassis from the dogs as
well traffic and casual video I thought
I would open up a little bit of blogger
mail for you it's been quite a while
since I did a blog the mail opening and
and I have what looks to be some pretty
exciting packages that's all I would
open them up with you today also at
forward I would just include a little
intro with my handsome little Dicky bow
because a lot of you have been saying
that you missed em so here he is looking
gorgeous as ever dexter is on the prowl
and I let him down so that they can have
a play so yeah a blogger mail opening
today you guys know the drill was vlog
Amell by now it's a very very fabulous
perk of the job we work very very hard
to create content and the gifts and
products that brands send us makes it a
lot easier and more affordable to blog
when I started my blog I never in a
million years dreamt that I would get
sent anything so I'm still very grateful
for every single thing and I thought I
would share the joy of opening them with
you guys so I'm going to get straight
stuck in there and this is from dr. or
got lipstick on I am from doctor organic
and I think we have a succulent in here
by the looks of it so we've got got a
little cactus this is I think aloe vera
aha
so a lot of the time brands will also
send something that really tells a story
about the tourists which is amazing and
means that I get to fill my house with
cement plants these files behind me are
actually from a dinner that I went to
last night it was the wrong gal a
fragrance dinner and the florist that
she came to the event at the end and I
said what you do with all these flowers
offers and he said they saw what they
can but a lot of them go in and thin and
I was no they can't let it happen
so I ended up taking quite a lot the
flowers home so hence the beautiful
floral backdrop but I
so however your plant we have got sulfur
from dr. organic and organic aloe vera
gel double strength moisturizer for dry
irritated and some exposed skin very
good timing
thank you dr. organic of course aloe
vera is the best for any kind of sunburn
aloe vera deodorant I guess you probably
wouldn't burn your underarms but because
it's very soothing I'll be a lovely one
to use and aloe vera lip balm to
moisturize and soothing and nourishing
also SPF 15 this is an over your
eyebrows with to convert eye bright and
witch hazel aloe vera conditioner of
course it's got the same property to
your hair soothing nourishing and
moisturizing and I guess I was going to
be the shampoo yeah so of course aloe
vera is the new range from dr. organic
and I believe you can buy these things
in Holland embarrass so if you are an
aloe vera fan or you just love organic
skin care then this is a really lovely
and you watch in case the Sun has just
decided to go behind a cloud but never
mind apologies for the strange lighting
next I have this very intriguing at
looking blog mail I have a little
briefcase I don't know who it's from the
suitcase is BIOS custom bail it says
this suitcase is the property of Josie
we don't know if it's going to be from
southern belle because I've never spoken
to them before and I don't know how they
would get my address
but let's have a little look inside ok
Claridge's Hotel new ah from pause ok oh
that's so cool look oh my gosh it smells
amazing got like all the stickers in
there so it's been a globe-trotting
suitcase travel documents hashtag escape
with palmer's that's so cute I've got a
little Hawaiian and they called an a le
I I think the chordal a floral headband
sticky sticky
stop it seems and then we have a new
coconut oil range I already love Paula's
coconut oil
I've used that boy lotion I've used that
body oil that hot oil love it so this is
their coconut oil repair and conditioner
we've got a couple of their conditioning
protein packs which are so handy taken
on holiday with you and leave-in
conditioner my hair needs diva
conditioner especially while I travel an
actual conditioning shampoo and so funny
they've been some Palmer's flip-flops
which is rather adorable look at this
there we go
Palmer flip-flops and then there's a
little information booklet here which
says travel documents so I guess it is
the press release and then what's that
oh and a memory card
oh it was we're doing a beauty tip so if
you have dry frizzy hair you can put
coconut oil actual coconut oil on as a
pre shampoo move on to 10 to 15 minutes
and then follow with your chunky which
will leave you is food and for neat
looks so definitely a good tip to give
out a try if your help getting really
dry from holidays perhaps oh my gosh let
me just go and tend to these animals and
with that it is a second ok so next up
we have got a lovely delivery from
Elizabeth Arden a little goodie bag and
I'm actually going to Wimbledon with
them tomorrow time so excited about
pretty much 4th time of Wimbledon this
year I've been pretty spoiled with lots
of loving day trips but let's see aha
but this is actually all my Wimbledon
information I don't see here is your pre
one with impact with your entry ticket
and decal for the day and from
hero skincare 400 from the gelato crush
range that something amazing so we've
got an itinerary they also organized it
even print that a little map and then
what's this gelato crush that looks
really really cool this is a press
report their new range another very very
colorful I think we might actually have
some approach in here slept a little
dirt
oh my goodness I'm so fine they've put
in an ice-cream fan so there's really
cost on the day which hopefully is bit
cloudy today and then we can use a
little ice cream from both so fun when
we find these things and and then we
have got skin renewal booster do to
start oh my goodness
so when they launched this they had an
overnight stay in Schad and I filmed a
video it was called get ready with me
for a day in London and I loved that
video so much it's majorly old-school
but I'll leave it linked on screaming
here because yeah I have a watch because
I was really proud of that video and the
serum is wonderful as well we've got
their city smart and remember the
ultimate now they were launching city
smart because it's a pollution protector
which at jammer and our shelters very
handy we've got an SPF stick yeah
targeted some defense SPF 50 and then a
low very colourful
well I think that colourful inside the
packaging black as well
this is their pink perfection cool glow
chicken that is literally a sorbet shade
very very bright colorful and and well
we've got some lip line up plump up lip
liner this is in the shade fire red
let's have it
oh wow that is like in this vibrant
coral red shade so beautiful I think
maybe I'll wear a white dress and have
big bold coral lips tomorrow so that's
going to come in very handy and a few
other goodies from Elizabeth Arden so
thank you girls from on UK you follow me
so much and I am very very very grateful
thank you this next one is from Lola

sunkissed glow with SPF 15 very good and
then we've got a couple of eyeshadows
beautiful neutral Brown which are their
low musicals this is a blush very very
vibrant pink and a matching vibrant pink
nail polish ultra shine also have
another eyeshadow of a lipstick I
believe yes long last in terms of lip
gloss and another lip pencil I am almost
up for lip pencils and it's for giving
those a try I don't think I've tried
anything from Lauder maker before so
looking for Jim now Joe this one looks
like it's wrapped in cling film I'm
trying not to show my dress too much and
it's like it's from enough Halle I think
it actually it's wrapped in cling film
quite good idea really protect the box
finally in so let's have a look what is
inside this beautifully packaged parcel
give this tissue paper oh my goodness
it's something silky Wow oh my goodness
sure I do in the Box wow this is a robe
I think oh my gosh look at this it's
probably making the light on a camera go
absolutely a well because it's black
gosh I don't know how you even a little
bit as missus wow this is aptly stunning
yeah this is probably going really crazy
on the lighting but a full length black
kimono style robe it's beautiful white
leaves of pique I've never been sent
anything fabric wives from the Perla
I've received their fragrance Teufel
which I'm left with but this is
incredibly generous well and this is
also the kind of thing that I know I
will wear a lot because especially new
summer mornings I just want a little
something over my 90 but not the full-on
dressing gown so this is going to get so
much use I feel very very spoiled
excited to give it a try I'll show if
you put
of me trying this on two guys can see
how it looks I think these are rather
pricey so an extremely generous gift and
one lucky lady so I actually just
unboxed it and then check the camera and
the lighting was crazy so I just opened
up this beautiful delivery from Germany
