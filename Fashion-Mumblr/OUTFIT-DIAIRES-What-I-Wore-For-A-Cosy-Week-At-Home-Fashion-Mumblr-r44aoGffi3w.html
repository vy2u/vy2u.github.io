everyone so quiet no the reason why I'm
not gonna I like I know good morning and
welcome to another whoops I wearing a
week video and other outfit diaries
thank you to the amazing response for
last one that was just very great to
hear that you guys are you stood in this
series so this week's video is going to
be very different to last week's one as
I am spending the week at my mother's
house she's not very well so we're
spending the week looking after her at
her house but I'm going to show you
still what I'm wearing it's going to be
very casual very cozy home wear but I
thought that'd be quite interesting for
you to see a few at-home outfits a few
relaxing things lots of cozy knit wear
lots of comfy trousers some pajamas
things like that so incredibly different
to the street style that you saw last
week but hopefully equally as equal is
wearable maybe more wearable in some
cases so the last clip that you saw was
when I was back home in London that was
on Clapham Common we took Dexter and
Dickens for a walk and we met a puppy
friend called Teddy and Teddy's mom
Holly she actually makes these
incredible dog beds which you saw there
slash carry cases which you saw Dickens
posing in earlier that's what Dexter and
Dickens were wearing yesterday and my
outfit was just basically dog walk
outfit cozy jumper from Zara it's
basically the softest jumper I've ever
felt in my life
covering what jeans I was wearing I
think they were just talk shop jeans and
then my EMU boots that's pretty much
what I wear whenever I walk the dogs
today I will show you in the mirror
super casual today you saw this jumper
in last week's video
it's the Tularosa one from revolve I
just love this sleeve detail really nice
color as well very autumnal and then I
actually pinched these leggings from mum
because I only really bought jeans or
cashmere trousers with me and she didn't
fancy wearing either so that's what I've
got on today this here
the cozy outfit selection that I fought
with me for the next couple of days lots
of nits few fur pieces faux fur and then
these are the amazing Marks and Spencer
Rosie for autograph cashmere trousers
I've not tried them on yet I've been
thinking about buying these for a few
years you've been in stock on the MS
website for a couple of years I never
invested in them previously but though
they are so beautiful I decided this
year was the year so I grabbed them to
bring them to Mom's house so yeah I'll
show you those in the next couple of
days one of the perks of working from
home it means constant coffee and
biscuit breaks I've just been sent this
little collection of biscuits from coast
they've got a collaboration with the
Royal Ballet so they've sent these
lovely biscuit ears I think mama will
like that one so I'm going to take that
upstairs for a cup of coffee
Oh
good morning it is Tuesday and today's
another stay-at-home day I have been
just wearing my most cozy outfit for
this morning we took mum for a hospital
appointment so I just did actually get
dressed so how is everybody what to say
to my pajamas all day but yeah I will
show you if I can this jumper so this is
basically the most classic and cozy
ottoman it it's from Marks and Spencers
and it was 35 pounds and it is a mark on
it no I think it's dog hair it's just
the softest most snuggly material ever
it's kind of stretchy got a nice high
neckline and I just absolutely love it
price per wear at 35 pounds is
incredible highly recommend everybody
gets something like this for that autumn
wardrobe and this ms1 just hits all the
nails on the head then I have got my
leggings on I say my leggings these are
definitely mums leggings I just rated
her troubles and found another pair of
black leggings but in an hour or so I'm
going to go and trade these leggings for
a skirt because we're going to Penny
Hill mums spa because chai wants to use
the gym there so I think I'm gonna try
and get him to take some photos for me I
have not posted a new Instagram photo in
like four days because I have been
anywhere to shoot any outfits so yeah
gonna be sweet eyes take some photos for
me so I'd better go upstairs and put
something decent on the dogs by the way
look we've got Coco up here on the sofa
lui looking out the window deck see down
here and then Dicky look at that boy my
precious hands that's a hard life for my
boob in that's a hard life for my boys
you chilling Co can you chilling I'm a
really big boy I'm a big boy
- Dixey making my king so here you can
see the jumper a little bit better just
a very classic and cozy piece I cannot
even begin to tell you how soft this is
and then underneath surprise surprise I
have my M&amp;amp;S thermal I wear these under
basically everything in the cooler
months it's a long sleeved one as you
can see the sleeves poking out here and
this is just a really lovely soft
material so that's what I've got on
underneath to keep me nice and toasty
but now I think I'm gonna put one of
these darker skirts on to shoot aunt
penny hill
my eyes do I want to stay you thought
you and me that way
we may give I'm taking I know I think I
don't watch you me pretty good for it
you gave me that smile we stood there
for a while
ha
I don't know
so back at penny Hill we've taken my
outfit photos thank you darling I
managed to persuade him and now each
house is going to go for a gym session I
have got too much wax news I'm gonna sit
in reception and get some work done and
edit those photos and hopefully you just
saw my outfit clips most of what I'm
wearing is actually in Marks &amp;amp; Spencer
very affordable people link below and
good morning another day another
relaxing from home outfit this is what I
have been lounging around in today the
jumper is the same as what I was wearing
yesterday my incredibly cozy M&amp;amp;S knit
piece which actually just wrote about on
the blog as well so yeah big fan of this
one it looks like so why it's the
lighting in this mirror looks like I've
got a little stain on it but in real
life it doesn't anyway um yeah love this
jumper thermal underneath as always it's
a long sleeve one is really really cozy
and then I am wearing and the leggings I
showed you when I first started filming
this video say leggings are kind of more
charles's so these are the I think
they're from the rosy for autograph
range and Marks and Spencers I mean
thinking about getting them for a few
years but this year finally decided to
make the investment you can actually see
my bright orange underwear that my need
to find some more nude colored underwear
but yeah very very cozy really nice
pieces to relax around the house in so
that's what I've been wearing today I
also need to iron this little bow
because it's looking a little bit
creased yeah really lovely soft material
and I'm very pleased that I went for
this color it's kind of like an oatmeal
color the other option I think was gray
I also had a few deliveries come to
Mom's house I ordered some shopping here
so I'm going to set you up on a tripod
and do a little mini haul within this
vlog I ordered some bits Reese some
really lovely kind of autumn investment
pieces and also some outerwear from
Topshop so let me find somebody to prop
you up and I'll show you what I bought
okay so from Reese I was looking at very
versatile pieces but said I can wear
throughout the autumn months and bits
aren't really particularly on-trend
is really classic because obviously Rhys
is more of an investment investment
price point so the first thing that I
picked up was this jumper dress it's in
a really lovely gray color which I think
will be very practical looks to be a
really nice length as well and then it's
got a slightly tighter skirt so that
should be quite fitted and then the top
is a little bit more loose fitting so a
little bit more balloony which is very
much on trend at the moment it's got a
cowl neck so very relaxed kind of
neckline and this kind of grayish brown
color which I find really really
versatile I'm big fan of the jumper
dress it's exactly how I thought it was
going to fit with the kind of tight more
elasticated material at the bottom very
clingy on the body and then it's got a
very tight elastic a bit on the waist
which allows it to billow over a little
bit on the top so you've got more of a
loose-fitting top the sleeves are quite
baggy as well it almost gives the effect
of a top and a skirt but actually it's
just one really cozy jumper dress
because of the amazing high neck you
could get away with wearing a thermal
underneath this as well very very cozy
needs a bit of an iron or steam but a
really lovely piece of looking chic and
staying warm in the autumn time and
winter so yes it's gonna keep this one I
really like the color of this as well
another piece that if I can imagine
getting a lot of use out of is a classic
jumper this one isn't a beautiful the
lighting on the camera is obviously a
lot more orange and it is in real life
but this is a kind of I don't really
know how to describe this color almost
like a caramely coloured knits once
again a really classic shade for autumn
I think just for jeans or also if you've
got like um that burgundy folder then
you look skirt that I showed you in a
previous haul I can imagine that going
really nicely with this okay these two
pieces I really really like the jumper I
think it's a beautiful color it's quite
baggy which yes I do not have a barn
it's quite baggy which I actually really
like I think it's just a very chilled
piece nice for relaxing at home but also
because it's Reese and the design is
just so lovely can definitely get away
with wearing it out shopping or to work
even tucked into some nice trousers this
is gonna make the lighting on the camera
go crazy but I picked up this coat
because I had this in a light pink color
last year at my warrants so much I
absolutely loved it the fit was just
absolute beautiful really feminine
really nice hook pulls in at the waist
so I decided to get the Bergen do you
want this year I'm gonna give it a try
and see how it looks on it needs to be
very very special for price point which
was 295 and so yeah a major investment
piece I need to be very sure that I'm
gonna wear it loads and loads and feel
really good in it so we'll see how this
looks
if only I had some burnt orange this
outfit would include all of the autumnal
colors this jacket is a beautiful shape
really like the collar detail looks
really nice of the roll neck on and
Ernie's got the roll neck that I showed
you a second ago color is beautiful fit
is beautiful it's got these little kind
of hidden pockets which I've not
unpinned yet but I don't think I'm going
to keep this because it is very similar
to the Ted Baker one in fact the Ted
Baker one that I have
I haven't actually showed you yet but I
will do very soon check my Instagram
stories I probably will have put it up
by then but yeah I actually slightly
prefer the color of the Ted Baker one
this one's a little bit too purple for
my liking but really like fits the
shoulders in particular fit really
beautifully if you've got quite a narrow
figure like I do then it's a really
lovely one sometimes I find this kind of
coat can be a little bit bulky but reefs
do really well at keeping them very
feminine so as beautiful as this coat is
it's not for me so this one's gonna be
going back to Reece calm then and this
is probably what I'm most excited about
I got the carry leather leggings so
since I worked in the Reese part Street
store many years ago I've just lusted
over these leggings I did actually get a
black pair from a sample sale when I
used to work there but they were the old
Styles a slightly different fits how
they are not now they're a little bit
like baggy around my bum and I thought
that these in this cocky color would be
really really versatile a little bit
different to the classic black leggings
because I don't really wear that much
black at all so I'll try those on and
let you know how I feel about those but
excited to give those ago the leggings I
really
like the fit is very tight I've gone for
a size for quite optimistically but I
did want to get the smallest that I
could get away with because I think they
might stretch out a little bit
lengthwise they're really good
considering I've got quite short legs so
that's great because they do actually
have a zip at the bottom so they'd be
quite hard to alter if I did want to
tailor them it's a little hidden zip
here these will look really lovely with
black ankle boots or even the khaki
colored Topshop boots that I tried on a
second ago
so yeah big fan of this outfit very old
tum know and I'm definitely aware these
pieces quite a lot and then this
beautiful piece this is a almost ox
blood but it is a brownie coloured
leather skirt it's got a scourge
paneling detail looks like it's going to
be really beautiful fit Rhys I always
think I was so good at making things
that just fit the body so perfectly if
it's so much effort into like the design
and the craftsmanship of the pieces and
this looks like a very very high quality
piece so this is the Reese skirt I'm not
entirely sure that the length is
flattering on me I'm quite a shorty I'm
often asked by you guys how tall I am
but I don't actually know not very tall
and I feel like this would suit someone
that's a little bit taller than I am
having said that the quality is
incredible it's so soft it feels
literally buttery leather I've put it on
with these Topshop heels I think maybe
if I had a very smart office job and I
was gonna wear something this smart
regularly then it would be worth the
money but for me tragically I don't
think is I think this one is gonna go
back but yeah if you do have a smart job
and you're a bit taller than I am then
it's a really really lovely piece
okey-dokey so next up is my Topshop
pieces a lot more affordable thankfully
and I picked these up actually with it
in my mind to do some blog photos but
obviously pieces I will wear after the
blog photos I've done these let me open
these and show you so these boots were
only 39 pounds which I thought was a
really really good value there are
beautiful kind of pinky brown color nice
heel height and just the kind of boots
that I find myself reaching for very
very frequently so I picked those up
there
this little they've got this stud detail
running around the edges very robust art
design and yeah this heel high just
means I can wear them all day and be
very comfortable so I thought they were
great value and price hood well know
it's gonna be really good I am a huge
fan of relays and I thought that the
colors on this one were really beautiful
it looks very real fairy but obviously I
would not wear real fur and so I thought
this one was a really good faux fur
alternative sixty-five pounds not a bad
price point and then you've got little
hook and eyes I think all quite big hook
and eyes for the opening and closure she
lays for me are really lovely layering
piece for this time of year I find that
they keep my body so so warm and you can
still see what you're wearing underneath
this will go really nicely with a lot of
my jumper dresses the Reese jumper dress
as well I think will look really lovely
underneath this so looking forward to
styling that's up Topshop Raziel a
actually looks way better with the Reese
jumper dress the textures and the colors
on this are just absolutely stunning
I really like this I can imagine getting
a lot of use out of it in the coming
months it does have pockets a nice
little pocket detail there and yeah I
think this looks a whole lot more
expensive than its price tag so
definitely keeping the GLA from Topshop
very very happy with that
find so this is the epic teddy bear coat
I bought this just out of curiosity
really I wanted to know how it look it
is absolutely ginormous and basically
feel like a giant tell you about wearing
this I love the color it's a very
classic shade for autumn this almost
burnt orange brownie color and you can
see the texture of this is really really
beautiful very on-trend with this faux
teddy fair effect and love the big
pockets I do really like the length and
I like how cozy it is I'm just not sure
how much I would wear this I think I've
got a lot of coats that I do prefer to
this but I'm gonna try styling it up I
might try and find an outfit from the
limited selection of clothes I've got
with me to wear to the gym because again
shows going to the gym which means I can
maybe get some outfit photos so I might
try to style this up that looks really
weird might try and style this up to
take some photos so again let me know
your opinion I feel like I can really
tell that when I made this order I
wasn't in my usual mindset everyone's
kind of rushing a little bit because a
lot of these pieces aren't as me as
pieces would normally be in a normal
shopping hall so a few wildcards a few
strange bits such don't suit me that
well
but I guess that teaches me right to try
and shop in a rush but let me know your
opinions and hopefully we can get
another nice outfit shot at penny Hill
later on this afternoon
all righty we are on our way to penny
Hill and we are in our new car which is
so exciting
so we with him I've been basically
working with master for a little while
you might have seen the vlog where we
fell in love with this car we went up
Scotland and as part of my ongoing work
with them they've loaned us this car for
a little while so we are now back in our
cx-5 which chance is very happy about so
it's great to just have something very
spacious and we can finally give
charlie's sister her car back
thank you scarlet for letting us borrow
the peugeot which was the baby i was
told that you should always name a car a
female name i think in the modern world
that we live in you know we can weaken
we'd have to abide by those
old-fashioned ones I think this car you
better turn you better be there when I
shake watch me rocking if I can't stop
if I should fall just go ahead
you better go back to movies good
morning so today we're back home back in
London just for today we're going to
head back to spend tomorrow with Martin
