potentially be a bit of a new series on
my youtube channel I thought I really
want to share with you more of what I'm
actually wearing as well as hulls and
look books because you see me talking
about so many clothes and those types of
videos but not what I'm actually wearing
on a day-to-day basis I thought I would
do kind of a weekly vlog but more
focused on what I'm wearing so I'm going
to be calling these videos my outfit
Diaries so I hope you like that idea um
just kind of came up with that ten
minutes ago over my morning coffee had a
bit of a lightbulb moment because what
I'm wearing today is what I have been
wearing pretty much non-stop for the
past week or so it's become my go-to
outfit so I thought I would kick it off
with this this is the outfit in question
if you watched my how to style a jumper
dress video which I'll leave up on the
screen now then you might recognize this
dress this is the one which is from ASOS
it is very affordable it is a cashmere
blend so it's really really comfy but
very affordable I think it was like 30
pounds or something along those lines
it's obviously not 100% cashmere but so
soft and just really versatile I've been
wearing it so much because it's just
fling it on and you know you're going to
get with this you don't need to worry
too much about what to pair it with I've
gone for quite yellowy mustard vibes
with my accessories these earrings are
from Zara I got these on Oxford Street
the other day and I'm loving tassel
earrings at the moment but I wanted to
try something a little bit different and
these because they're pom-poms I don't
wear anything but you still get a really
nice kind of effect with them my hair is
being really weird it's not really
parting anywhere so I'm just clipped
that back with a clip from accessorize
and and then as we move down I've got my
bag from Aspen all you might have seen
my Fashion Week flog or I went see Aspen
or presentation I wore this one and I
felt like the color tones just went
really really well
then my boots these ones I wore so much
last year these are from Zara again um
but I think they will probably bring out
a similar version this year but I also
feel like Karen Millen have something
quite similar in at the moment I'll try
and leave some similar ones linked down
below and then for my outerwear
I think I'm gonna wear this for the
first time I haven't even taken the
label out yet it's from Topshop
I've been looking for a teddy bear coat
for so long you might remember this from
last Sunday's haul video which actually
hasn't gone live as I'm filming this
it's Saturday today but yeah I'm gonna
give this try so let me pop it on so
this is the look with the coat I feel
very very beige but don't think that's
too much of a bad thing I do love a good
neutral palette so there we go that's
what I'm gonna be wearing today just
flip it round while I'm talking to the
camera so yeah that's what I'm gonna
wear today I'm heading to Windsor to
meet my lovely friend Sophie so if he's
getting married next year and we're
going wedding-dress shopping today so
it's gonna be a very exciting day
I'm not going to vlog inside the wedding
dress shops that'd be very weird but
I'll catch up with you guys later
good morning a very very quick outfit of
the morning because I've got a PT
session starting in 20 minutes so I'm
head to toe in my gym gear this is
easily my favorite gym outfit at the
moment it is head to toe sweaty Betty's
surprise surprise I'm obsessed but I
just really like this color combination
so I've got a light pink vest top it's
probably officially a yoga vest top but
I just love it for over the top of my
sports bra which is this not sure if you
can see the color but it's like a wine
burgundy shade but absolutely love that
and then the burgundy shade is kind of
shown in the leggings as well which have
these almost oriental floral print and I
just love them a nice and high-waisted
if I wasn't showing at the gym I would
probably spend the rest of the day in
this outfit trainer wise these are my
Nike trainers really comfortable and
then I've also got these sweaty Betty
socks which have a bit of a lip on them
which makes them very very comfortable
that's my outfit of the morning super
brief but let's go to gym and I'll show
you a little bit of what I get to in my
PT session
so that was my morning workout it's
actually now half past six in the
evening and I've spent the whole day
just working from home today so I'll
show you what my at home totally chilled
out outfit looks like so I'm wearing
this jumper which I have been wearing
both in the house and out to meetings
and things I just absolutely love it
this is from a new look and it was
$29.99 it's gone down very very well on
Instagram so if you follow me on
Instagram you may have already seen it
and it's so cozy so affordable it's got
many nice long sleeves as well so if you
like to have your hands covered I've got
mine rolled up trying to unroll it but
looking like a doorknob there we go yeah
it's got really nice long sleeves just
super super cozy you've actually caught
me on quite a smart day normally I just
have like track your bottoms on but
these jeans are probably the comfiest
jeans that I own they are from American
Eagle I've had them for a couple of
years really nice fits and they're
really elastic so they just basically
feel like pajama bottoms and then on my
feet I have got my slippers these are
from EMU and they're just the most
gorgeous design and they are so soft so
snuggly and they are yet to be shredded
by the dogs and hopefully I'm going to
keep them that way so this is my outfit
of the day very glam a day in the
fashion mumbler household so yeah I will
see you guys tomorrow and I'm actually
gonna be doing some fun things tomorrow
so we'll have normal clothes on yeah
I'll see you then
I'm still tired when I wake up like my
dreams to me
smooth spider my best friend now get me
away from me I got plans I got things to
do then I do my hours do my hours but is
everything so damn hard
I postpone everything stupid things
start
begone Sunday's replace wee-wee
I just wanna feel
the whole
is Tuesday and you guys would have just
seen a lovely beautifully filmed clip of
my outfit for today but I thought I
would just quickly talk through it as
well I've just spend the whole day out
at meetings so looking a little bit more
vertical than when those clips were
first filmed but I'm gonna quickly talk
through my outfit so this is what I wore
today skirt is probably the focal point
of the outfit
and probably the cheapest part of the
outfit as well this was from new look
you might have spotted it in my haul
from last week this top which has a bit
of a stain on it not sure if you can see
this this is from Karen at Milan last
year I actually got this in a shopping
mall in Abu Dhabi but absolutely loved
it I just really really like this kind
of pie crust detail on the neckline um
it's got quite a cool little detail on
the back there as well I'm not sure if
you saw that but yeah I love this and
definitely looking out for something
similar this year I do have something
fairly similar with gold detailing on
the neck and on the sleeves from Ted
Baker as well so I'll leave that linked
in the description box if you want
something along those lines because this
is definitely out of stock and then I
wore these shoes which are my little
greeny brownie suede sandals from
Topshop so yeah really like this outfit
very feminine and very autumnal good
morning it is Wednesday I have just had
an amazing blow-dry at pool Edmonds
which is on Brompton Road hence why my
hair looks a lot better than it normally
does they were using a new shoe Ameri
repelling spray which is just great for
hair condition feels very simply soft
and I just came for those straw
Ronson square I am so wishing that I had
someone with me right now to take some
outfit photos because this is just the
most perfect autumnal road not sure what
you can see it's just so beautiful the
leaves are changing color it's one of
those stereotypical blobby streets major
first of all problems but perfect
location perfect blow dry and no one to
take photographic evidence of it but
this morning I had breakfast at
tiffany's literally we were trying on
diamonds I was trying on engagement
rings not for that reason but just
playing up playing dress-up because we
were there for the launch of the new
Tiffany perfume so really nice starts a
day and I'm going it to the Bronte cafe
now hopefully going to be able to get
some outfit shots ooh I'll show you what
I'm wearing

I'm doing a challenge with mr. Burrage
new fragrances tonight so I can't change
it I will show you now everything is
they are really long
I just drive

you and me that way give and take and I
know I think I don't want you me pretty
good for it

for a while
Wow it is now Thursday and we're

really fun events going on today heading

call it I think I'm gonna make these
videos a weekly thing coming away on
Mondays showing you a little bit of what
I'm doing but mostly what I'm wearing so
let me know if that sounds good today
the day started with a breakfast at
children firehouse and my favorite
places and it was with the founders of
fresh skincare for quite surreal meeting
them after being obsessed with their
face masks and cleansers etc really
lovely to hear the history of the brand
too so that was a great way to start the
day and then I nipped down to Selfridges
had a meeting there for the brand trish
mcevoy which i've tried to cover their
bits and bobs before but not too much
and i've walked away very generously
with this incredible makeup planner
inside
it's kind of like a Filofax but for
makeup which I'm very very excited about
so I've got a highlighter I've got some
lipsticks all in this kind of like quite
a fax but for your makeups so very
excited to try these makeup pieces out
