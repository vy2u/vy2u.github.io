my outfit Diaries I hope you're enjoying
them so far today is Tuesday hopefully
this is not the first clip that you're
seeing of this vlog because if it is it
means I've not been able to get back the
footage that I shot yesterday basically
I left my big cannon on the tube which
I'm very angry and upset about as you
can imagine it's a very expensive camera
and I can smell dog poop I'll sort that
in a minute
yeah basically left my cannon on the
tube yesterday somewhere on the Victoria
Line or the Northern Line it's a very
expensive camera and I'd spend the
morning shooting photos for not only
this video and Instagram but also for a
job that I'm working on a sponsored blog
campaign so really really bloody annoyed
with myself if you did see clips however
before this one then it means I've
somehow managed to get it back so
fingers crossed praying praying praying
um but yeah it's Tuesday today I'm in my
comfy clothes at the moment got a little
chicky chicky on my lap I don't know why
I've stopped calling him that little
Dickens on my lap he's so loving at the
moment like whenever I sit down he
always just comes to cuddle me so yeah
I'm working from home this morning we
actually have a designer from sharps
coming around in a second because I
really want to turn our silly little box
room into a walk-in wardrobe it's been
like a dream of mine ever since we moved
into the house so that guy or girl and
it's gonna be coming around in the next
half an hour to talk through a few
different designs which I'm so excited
about storage in this house is just such
a huge issue so be amazing if they can
provide any kind of nice solution so
this morning I'm wearing a very casual
outfit for just working at a house this
is actually a top that I've stolen from
Charlie's mum sorry both it's from Zara
and it's just a really comfy gray
loungewear top we call two sleeves and
then at the back I don't know if I've
got to show you but it's got like pearls
three pearls down the back so just a
really lovely detail and then these are
the trousers
the M&amp;amp;S cashmere trousers that I showed
you in last week's video in my cozy
outfit Diaries vlog and I've been
wearing them so much already getting
good price per wear out of them while
I'm down here as well new coffee table
we ordered this months ago so many
months ago like literally half a year
ago and it arrived but the marble was
broken in half which was so upsetting
and then it didn't come back into stock
for ages but it finally did on Oliver
bonus and I bought it again so so
pleased to have our coffee table up and
running the lounge finally feels like a
lounge again how cute does the coffee
table look I'm so pleased with it and
I've just put on these lovely roses
they're like these everlasting roses
from this company Fleur de peri got a
couple of my favorite candles
german-owned pomegranate Noir and then
these little coasters are from
Anthropologie another pomegranate Noir I
get so many questions about this this is
my laptop case and it's from a company
called coconut Lane and they very kindly
sent me a discount code which i think is
my name so Josie in capitals and then 20
for 20 percent off the whole site so
yeah if you want to treat yourself it's
very affordable I think this is like
under 20 pounds just in case you're one
of the people that have been asking me
about it now you know oh and I've got my
lovely and EMU slippers on again so
super cozy for
total total total
okay so bang from sharps is over at the
moment he's just gone to the car to get
some fabric samples so I just nicked his
little sketchbook to show you the plans
because this is all very very exciting
looking we've decided to have a little
seat under the window with some shelving
or draw space underneath this is where
chai is gonna keep his shoes more shoe
storage for Charlie and then some double
hanging space here for him my side we're
gonna have a shelving unit that I can
put like handbags pretty shoes flowers
all that kind of thing and then this is
where my shoes will be an open hanging
section and then loads and loads of
hanging space here so this is the design
at the moment panty it's going to take
about five weeks until this will be able
to be built but yeah how exciting is
this all coming to life okay so I'm in
central London now it's speaking quite
me because I'm in the Harley Street
clinic I'm here to get my brows done
with HD brows and my lashes curled with
lvl lash lift so I'll show you that
process but very quick outfit the day
jumper is this one from Topshop got this
quite recently really love the color
leggings and little research shoes which
I'd rather love
oh and in the bag this one is my wire
sell never fool I think it's called wire
sell bucket bag most practical bag ever
and then little Monica minute the
necklace and jewelry my browser title
back home again and I'm looking
absolutely ridiculous so I had my brows
and my lashes done as you saw earlier
and then not that my face was hurting at
all it definitely wasn't I just wanted
something calming on my skin but I
didn't want to put a proper face mask on
because you have to be quite careful
with getting your lashes wet after the
LVL so I found this strange item in my
bedside drawer and it's a cooling and
firming forehead strip from skinned
Iceland
sorry Serge put that on and then these
are some under id puffing gel things but
they're not very liquidy so I'm not sure
if maybe these are a little bit old so
yeah having to pump evening my lashes
and brows are looking amazing I have had
LVR before but i forgot what an impact
it makes so LVL is when they basically
it's some service from Nouveau Dash's
you would lie back and you have like a
liquid put onto your lashes which almost
I think it kind of breaks down the
protein or the structure of your lashes
which makes them very moldable and then
there's a template that they press the
lashes onto and then another liquid goes
on your lashes which sets them into that
beautiful curved shape and then you also
have your lashes tinted as well so when
you have finished your treatment I'm not
sure if this camera will pick it up but
you basically look like you have false
lashes on but it's your own lashes so
very very effective I won't need to have
a scar for the next few weeks because it
looks so so great so very happy with my
lashes and then the brows they were
waxed they were threaded they were
shaped they were plucked they were
colored and hopefully that will mean
that I don't need to worry so much about
doing too much my brows over the next
few weeks as well and that was with HD
brows so really nice pampering afternoon
I have now put on some new pyjamas which
as you can see are a little bit weird so
I like them mostly they remind me Dickie
stop chewing they kind of remind me of
the Olivia Van Hollen's which I have the
beautiful dusky pink pajamas in that
silky material and which are of course
ridiculously expensive I bought these
because they very much reminded me of
those Olivia Van Horn's and I adore them
except for this weird can see that
sleeve detail trying to show you in the
mirror hold on so they're a beautiful
beautiful dusky pink the exact same as
Olivia van hull pajamas but then they go
and ruin it with this weird
it's got like an open arm which I really
don't like I really wish it didn't have
this strange detail when you'll just
like this you can't see it but for
example this arm like that's my elbow
poking out so such a strange design
detail and I find that quite a lot with
your violin things like most of it is
wonderful and then they put like a
random logo on like I also wish this
wasn't here my initials are not are I so
I don't really want our eye on my
pajamas and who wasn't for that and the
weird opening sleeves and these would be
stunning but I'm still really happy with
them really good prices some nice kind
of silky pajamas so that is my final
outfit of the day if you will I'm gonna
catch up with you guys in the morning
no no
good morning it is Wednesday today it
started with another little panther
session I went to Harvey Nichols and had
a gel manicure using nails and colors I
always been of great service it is so
you can basically choose any color from
the nails inc range which as you know
they have so many I went for a shade
called
afternoon Walker which is a beautiful
kind of browning color and then they mix
it with a chroma gel to turn it into a
gel which is fact that it lasts for two
weeks I will show you my outfit in a
second my makeup is looking a little bit
scary I didn't put too much on today but
in a minute when I'm kind of pulling for
show you a better day sorry I got a bit
cut off and two girls like my age
started walking towards me and I find it
so awkward vlogging in front of people
that my age some girls especially so
I've got a busy day of meetings this
morning I'm heading to my favorite place
of meetings now which is the farm girl
cafe in the sweaty Betty flagship
meeting talking about beauty there which
be really really lovely
so I will take you along and hopefully
show you my outfit at some point back
home now I didn't get to show you my
outfit while I was out and about so I'll
quickly show you now it's quite a
chilled outfit but I'm really liking the
color combination at the moment so same
trousers and hue combination as I wore
yesterday just find them very
comfortable and very versatile trousers
as I mentioned these are a couple of
years old but I will try to find
something that's available to purchase
now if I can only that link down below
shoes also reset couple of seasons old
but I'm hoping to find something similar
cuz I wear these so much and then the
top half these are both Reis items
really comfy and cozy this is a faux fur
seal a really love the color of this
it's like almost a lie lucky gray with
little pocket in there the top
underneath I need to kind of put a
little stitching to catch it because if
I didn't have a top on underneath it
would be very very revealing but it's a
lovely cozy piece long sleeves nice
knitted material very warm but yeah it
does kind of gape open so I'm looking
out for a nice silky vest that I can
wear underneath things like this so if
anyone has any recommendations for
places to buy nice vests as in the kind
of s you don't mind people seeing then
let me know some looking out for that
necklace um this is from the Monaco
vanad Arriva collection which I'm a huge
fan of and then I've got a couple of
Monaco venator bracelets on as well I'm
thinking of getting this top one
engraved with 200,000 on there because
when I hit a hundred thousand YouTube
subscribers
I had a Monica van into a bracelet
engraved with a hundred thousand so yeah
I might engrave that one worth two
hundred thousand so that's what I've
been wearing today I'm going to get
changed now into something a little bit
more comfy because I'm going to film a
video which means tracksuit bottoms are
going on
and super early this morning bright and
early for a bxr classic not done before
very excited to try it I was invited by
simple skincare so hopefully gonna be
trying out through the new products are
in the class that's what I'm wearing at
the out where that I would get here is
this amazing kind of dressing-gown like
Coach at the islands which hopefully
I'll be able to show you but that's
later on and then I've got my pink you
don't even need me to tell you where my
sports stuff is from it's also to Betty
my pink workout burst and then new
leggings which of their fun sculpting
ones so my bums looking good this
morning which is great and yeah excited
for the class gonna burn off my girly
that I had for the world's acutest gym
bathroom so I found a full-length mirror
so I can show you quickly my gym outfit
sweaty Betty top and sports bra and then
these are the leggings which I'm a big
big fan of
okay so after so workout is complete
that was a really really good start to
the day and then I used the new products
from the limited edition simple range to
cleanse and moisturize afterwards
they've kind of designed the range with
more of a gym focus so just providing
cleansing of the skin before a workout
and after with my set of face wipes in
shower face wash and the light hydrating
cream so it's very nice half of a pound
per session and also the showers of the
XR we're probably the best showers I
have ever experienced there definitely
going to be heading back better now my
first appointment of the day is here at
Topshop I'm in the personal shopping
suite and I'm picking out an outfit or
two and I'm looking for things I can
layer so as well as general autumn
wardrobe it's I really want to find some
layering pieces so the personal shopping
girls have pulled together some amazing
bits involves the room it's just kind of
like filled with clothes which is very
exciting I gave them a bit of a brief
and they pulled out some amazing things
they obviously know my style very well
because they've also picked out some
bits that I already own like my jacket
and the juillet and um couple of skirts
and things like that so I'm gonna try
some pieces on I will show you what I'm
trying so let's do this and before I do
that I will just quickly show you my
outfit of the day so I'm wearing a top
top dress already this one you probably
saw my first outfit diary video I just
love it so much and then I've paired it
with these burgundy boots they are the
ones that have they're kind of more of
painting material at the bottom and then
more suede and they are from a Rees I
love them really good investment boot I
think I'll get a lot of wear out of
these in the autumn months and then I
was wearing it with my river island coat
which also feels like a dressing gown
super super snuggling so this first look
that I've tried on is one of my layering
looks I have gone for this beautiful is
almost like a velvet material dress I am
really liking these more terminal kind
of dark floral dresses at the moment but
sometimes a dress is you want to be a
little bit warmer so for that reason I
put a row neck top underneath it row
necks for me I just one of the most
versatile things
in an autumn wardrobe so gone for this
quite a neutral colored roll neck which
I think will be very very practical acts
like a bit of a vest as well so it keeps
you nice and toasty and then to finish I
put a G lay on top I actually already
have this one as well but the girls
pulled it out with me so I can try it
with this outfit I would probably wear
dark tights on cooler days I got bare
legs and these little pointed toe boots
on at the moment what I'm going to do is
try to find all the bits that I try on
and link them down below so just check
out like Topshop whole section or
Topshop Tryon section in the description
box if you like anything that you see
here I also picked out this bag which
weather-worn crossbody or just held as a
clutch I think just finishes its look
off really nicely so good start let's
move on to outfit number two this is
another look with my same role neck on
underneath I've paired it with this it's
quite a spongy material like a squishy
Chevron detail on the skirt with these
big kind of retro 60s circle cutouts and
then I've put on the faux fur pink coat
love this color combination it's quite
autumnal cuz the faux fur and the roll
neck and yet the colors are beautiful
pastels so if like me you love your past
doors this is a really cute combination
another option with this roll neck I've
tried on this top which is got these
amazing slit sleeves now I'm not too
sure the periwinkle blue works for me
but I definitely wanna try this top in a
few different colors because I like the
fact that you have the row neck base
layer sleeves coming out from underneath
so I'm gonna ask Chloe who's my personal
shopper to see if she can pull out this
in a different color
and we have gone to the 1960s I'm trying
on a pair of Flair's I never would have
picked these up but I'm actually in love
with them I think they are so flattering
this is the security tag by the way
which is why I'm looking a little bit
crazy again got the roll neck top on
seriously versatile and I think it's
like 20 pounds I think so definitely
going to be picking this up yeah how
cool do these look got the pointed toe
shoes on as well which adds to the kind
of retro vibes I've just popped the G
lay on top and I really like this
addition to the outfit as well this as I
I already have him and it's just such a
versatile piece so I will definitely be
picking up these flares as well really
really love them and I really like them
with these boots as well which I tried
on with the dress earlier so I think
this is going to be my second outfit of
choice and for the next addition I have
added it's the blouse that I tried on in
the periwinkle color earlier the girls
have just picked me out at the top in
white they've also got it in this
burgundy color and black really liking
him white this kind of 60s outfit with
the flares so I think I'm gonna add this
to my wish list for my layering ideas
but yeah it's just nice to make a little
bit more small it's a little bit more
kind of floaty next I've gone for this
skirt which is like a green almost
patient material but still under 40
pounds they're really nice affordable
one and then this top is really unusual
it's almost like a Victoriana style with
this ruffled collar detail which you
know I find just absolutely love and
then instead of the juillet although you
probably could also pair this ye lay
with it I've gone for a faux fur scarf I
had one of these last year from Reiss it
was quite pricey but I invested and I
wore it so much and it's more of a pink
color so I've picked this one up as a
neutral option you could definitely wear
a belt as well I've got a few options
here the girls grabbed and that would
really help to just cinch in the waist
make it a little bit more flattering
I've tried this outfit on with the hats
and I feel like this is the perfect
autumn has huge wide brim gorgeous
neutral brown color and it's kind of
like a woolen felt it material so it
should be really nice and warm kind of
adds to the 60s vibe of this Tryon
session so yeah what do you think should
I get the Hat next a bit more of a
casual number this is a pair of straight
leg trousers I think these are the Moto
denim and this white very casual very
cozy jumper I do feel like I have an
outfit quite similar to this already do
I need another jumper like this but do
you really like it and it's very soft
and cozy also again paired it with the
pointed toe shoes it's quite harsh
having the black shoes at the bottom of
the light colored trousers but again
just loving this pointed toe I really
don't know whether I need another jumper
I'm not sure I can say no to the songs
is so soft really like this big Bellary
neck as well I can definitely fit my
thermal underneath it which is always a
plus point this jumper I am really
really liking so it's kind of like
almost a ballerina jumper with this
twist not detail in the front section I
do have something quite similar from
Reese but it really billows open and
hangs open and reveals my bra or vest
underneath so this I feel like is a much
safer option and far more affordable
paired it with these mustard-colored
trousers are quite 60s vibe with also
like some ring detail on the zip other
side I'm not too sure watch use I pair
them with maybe I will try these 10
suede shoes I'm going to go with this
handbag as well let's see how this would
look just adding a slightly darker shade
in there I think that's nice again quite
60s noir to the 60s trend with this
circle detail on the bag probably parrot
with the she'll a and you could probably
put the Rolo neck top underneath it as
well if you want to make this blouse a
little bit warmer but yeah definitely
gonna get the jumper can see myself
wearing this a lot very much my style I
am in love with these trousers they are
like this oxblood burgundy color that
probably shows the color a little bit
better though leather trousers I love
leather trousers and wear them so much
at this time of year as you'll have seen
earlier in this log I had that new D
pair that were seasons old from Zara B's
I think of 36 pounds and this color is
just like autumn goals I think they're
quite a statement piece but at the same
time I find that so many outfits go with
leather trousers and I wear them so so
so much these also they're quite like
thick they're very elastic E so very
comfortable feel like I'm wearing
leggings which is always a bonus to be
super comfy and they have kind of a
brushed up lining as well so they just
feel like you're wearing clouds on your
legs
so these I'm definitely getting and
you'll be seeing me wearing these so
much because I have obsessed okay so I
think I've chosen my outfits got back
dressed into my normal outfit and the
girls are tottering everything up let's
see what the damage is I thought it
could be show you my outfit with the
coat on cuz
it looks pretty cool and I'm in love
with it here we go so it is super long I
feel like I'm wearing a dressing-gown
out in public which is always a good
thing super cozy I do feel a little bit
gangster a little bit P Diddy ish
because it's so long and this like faux
shearling I think it was around the 85
pound mark but I think I will get a lot
of wear out of it so hopefully that
price pearl will come right down so I'm
gonna pay for my pieces I've also got a
restored er to click and Collect
and then I'll catch up with you a little
bit later
YouTube channel overflowed
nice to be here let's check out the new
collections
leave these out I think
and the spy Japanese
these French houses so huge goes
they were allowed to try bits on from
the new Caesar and I'm not gonna know
discuss so I have something quite
similar which is pink better but
and look I'm matching with it
hello and happy Friday
so I stupidly forgot to bring my
vlogging camera out with me today so the
clips you just saw were all filmed on my
iPhone so sorry if the quality wasn't
too good I left the house quite early
this morning for a gym session which
hopefully you'll have seen a few clips
of wearing actually not all SuperDuper
ones I was wearing sweaty Betty leggings
and sports bra and then I had a Nike top
over the top which actually I don't like
as much as my sweaty better ones but
they were all in the wash so that's what
I washed the gym and then this is what
I've been wearing all day today I
actually felt quite from being this
jumper earlier when I first put it on
but then a lady came up to in the
changing room of the gym and
complimented on it said that she really
liked my out finchy love the jumper so I
instantly felt better so if you ever see
anyone and you like that outfit
definitely say something I always do
because you never know it might
completely change how they're feeling
about their outfit for the day so that's
happened this morning so yeah this is
what I wore today this is the cozy polo
neck no it's not panic roll neck jumper
this is actually a high street version
of the Reese one that I got last week
because I get really funny about like
high quality knitwear I don't like
wearing it on more casual days because I
don't want to ruin it so I got this one
really liked it it's got a bit of a
dipped hem at the back bit of an
asymmetric hem which I like and then my
M&amp;amp;S skirt yes panel underneath my Marks
and Spencer dark green it looks black
here but it's dark green corduroy skirts
bargain and my Zara boots which are
probably getting very bored of I have
found a few alternatives that you can
buy at this time of year this season so
I'll leave that link down below so yeah
today after the gym we had our PT
session first thing and then I had
breakfast with a sternum you which is
probably one my favorite which is one of
my favorite jewelry brands as you guys
know they were launching the orbit
collection which is a new range of
jewelry and I very kindly was given
these earrings which are so beautiful I
will leave the link down below price
point wise I think a stream you just
have it absolutely perfectly it's much
higher quality than like typical high
street pieces but it's not expensive
jewelry like not given
or like links that kind of thing I just
love them and then I also have two new
rings from Astrid mu which I love as
well really beautiful
again I'll leave these ones linked down
below so you can shop them after the
estrogen mu breakfast which is beautiful
they're Dalloway Terris with lots of
lovely other bloggers I then what did i
do then oh I went to the evader flagship
in Covent Garden and how to pedicure
there I loved getting my nails done
there it's just such a nice vibe a
really really nice and they do she like
manicures so I had a pedi then I went to
surprise surprise the farm girl cafe and
sweaty Betty
if you ever in what London then chances
are if you go there I will be there
um but yeah love it there so I had a
couple of meetings there and then I came
home so that's what today has been full
of Charlie and I gonna go out for a
burger later typical Friday afternoon
activity and then we're probably gonna
have an early night I'm not sure if
we're going to cinema tonight I think
Charlie actually wanted to see Blade
Runner so maybe we're doing that but
that's not gonna be very exciting for
you guys you've seen me eating a burger
a million times so I am going to switch
off and see you tomorrow so yeah cheerio
see you good morning it is Saturday I
say morning I'm starting the actual
vlogging part today at like 5:00 p.m.
and today we've just been doing house
stuff all day after a quick workout this
morning within which I was wearing sorry
Betty of course kneeling beside and now
it's the afternoon so we just starting
to get ready for tomorrow we've got a
full day photo shoot tomorrow at Clifton
house which is a beautiful National
Trust property so I really want to film
like an autumn lookbook or something
there which should be really really
lovely so I'm just going through my
rails any new bits and bobs that maybe
I've not tried on as an outfit before
I'm pulling those out and trying them on
so to do that I've just got this really
crazy jumper on Ord this from River
Island not too long ago
yeah I thought that it's getting to a
time of year where we really want those
kind of cozy grandpa vibes so I really
like this jumper and then these leggings
are faux suede or like yeah faux suede
leggings I just love this kind of rouser
I find them very very versatile find
myself wearing them a lot and they are
incredibly comfortable
excuse the mess behind this is what
happens when I'm preparing for a filming
day so we're probably gonna spend the
next couple of hours just getting
outfits ready preparing bits and bobs to
pack ready for tomorrow because we have
got an early start in the morning we
have just had a delivery from biscuit
ears and these are the guys if you
watched my outfit Diaries last week
these are the people that sent the or
that made the biscuits for the coast
Royal Ballet collaboration this is their
Halloween collection so you can get
individual ones these I was showing a
set but this is like a gift box you can
get obviously it's like Day of the Dead
kind of thing which is really awesome
definitely keep this box for little
trinkets and things like that so I
thought I'd show you what is inside Wow
oh my goodness this is such a good idea
if you've got your friends that don't
like kind of typical Halloween but love
bright colors like a skull Day of the
Dead feet and Halloween gift box that is
epic look at that so I've got plenty of
treats for this afternoon to keep us
going while we carry on hyejung and
salting the house so this one is rather
fun it's like a gingerbread man but
obviously a little bit mummy find he's
got a skeleton hand he's got cut he's
got bandages all over him and then this
one is a ghost I personally love loads
of icing so I'm definitely gonna be
devouring that one so this is a very
kind blog mail thank you very much
biscuit ears I will enjoy to moshing at
least one of these with my afternoon cup
of tea so I thought I would try out
these Charlotte Tilbury dry face masks
ahead of shooting experience and this is
the weirdest face mask I have ever tried
I can't even stop staring at my face
because I look like some kind of mass
murderer and
but it's meant to like lift and hydrate
and brighten etc etc but it's dry it's
so weird like there's no liquid going
onto my face it's like putting a bit of
cotton on your face powder you can use
it three times so hopefully this will
give me amazing skin but I've just done
some editing on this vlog and it looks
like it's gonna move about half an hour
long so I'm gonna wrap things up and
thank you so much for watching if you
got this far then leave some kind of
fruit emoji or star emoji in the comment
section below and then I'll know who got
to the very end because this is
definitely a long one so I'm gonna leave
you with this beautiful image and see
you next week right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
