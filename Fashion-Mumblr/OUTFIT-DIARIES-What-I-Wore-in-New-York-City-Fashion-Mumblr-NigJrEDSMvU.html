City outfit Diaries vlog we are here for
the next three and a bit days and it's
gonna be a very fun and action-packed
trip so I thought I would vlog and bring
you along with me and most importantly
show you what I'm wearing it's kind of
going into winter here the temperature
is around like 12 degrees so I've got
lots of layers with me lots of things
that you've not had the chance to wear
this year and also as we were here with
Kate Spade I have lots of gorgeous new
accessories too so I'm excited to show
you what we're wearing today is our
busiest day I have a full itinerary with
the Kate Spade team today so Charlie and
I are just going to nip outside take
some photos quickly and then the fun
will begin
a delicious breakfast
we have now got our little tour but the
little lifers behind me we've taken the
bus to Madison Avenue one of the main
shopping streets in New York City and we
are heading into the Kate Spade flagship
we have so kindly been given
a little goodie bag with a voucher
inside so it's time to shop
so we're in the flagship store on
Madison Avenue and is four floors of
Kate Spade goodness this place is
absolute interior goals look all the
light fittings so beautiful and then
this little area here inside the bridal
area put so much in smoke like wedding
gifts bracelet ah this is so cute
disposable holder oh my god
I want everything
a delicious lunch at the exclusive BG
cafe which is aimed Bergdorf Goodman and
now afternoon activity we are taking a
helicopter ride over New York City
oh my god oh so excited
hey I need a boost way too late but I
just can't get my eyes of you maybe we
will regret this but tomorrow is another
day and I will do anything I will do
anything we just got back a helicopter
ride which was in credible it was just
so amazing seeing New York from above
like now it kind of makes a bit more
sense to me where everything is in
relation to each other and yeah it's
just incredible I was blown away by that
now sadly it's a little bit rainy so
I've just come up to the rear I'm gonna
drop my stuff off and I think I'm gonna
have a quick stroll down the road to
pick up a juice because there's a juice
generation nearby which I'm obsessed
with so going to pick up something from
there maybe some coffees Charlie's out
shooting with a photographer but I think
he's gonna be back soon so I'll pick him
something up to eat as well I think I'm
gonna film a u.s. halt again another one
when I'm back home so I'm not going to
show you what I've picked up from Kate
Spade but all will be revealed in an
upcoming video so yeah I'll catch up
with you guys a little bit later a few
hours later now and we're heading
downstairs to meet the gang we're going
to dinner at our favorite restaurant is
called while we were young and we went
there twice during a four-night trip
last time we were here it was so good we
had the wheat berry Maqui cheese which
was amazing
four points yeah it is to them this guy
that owns it is so clever he made it
with like bloggers in mind I don't know
that his strategy but it's just most in
Squamish if you make a restaurant
photogenic Fremont will take
lots of photos yeah well they're for
Shepherd mm-hmm so it's free marketing
exactly so we're going back there and if
you didn't see my have to spend three
days in New York video then I'll leave
that linked up on the screen because
you'll see it in more detail there and
that's generally a pretty good video if
you are coming to New York anyway let me
flip the camera around and show you what
Charlie and I wearing this evening okay
so this is a little bit unusual for me
it's quite a dark outfit I'm wearing
this cute little jumper from Kate Spade
it says maybe it's cold outside and then
I thought I would seem the very casual
jumper with my Club Monaco burgundy
pleated skirt which looks really dark in
this lighting and just kind of jazz it
up a bit and then I've got the same
boots on that I had earlier today these
are my Highline boots from Stuart
Weitzman coat is my Kate Spade one that
I've been wearing all day today and then
my usual accessories Monica bin under Oh
new Kate Spade earrings which are really
pretty and my snazzy Michael Kors XS
watch which I'm growing more and more
obsessed with every single day and you
darling what are you wearing I am
wearing just art yes
why come on projects which I am in love
with obviously a bit of an investment
but they're worth it jeans diesel diesel
jeans which as we know is my go to you
and then with all M&amp;amp;S this is M&amp;amp;S love
it as is the roll neck very nice
Oh
very
is sweet right CAC
back in Soho area now all of my filming
duties for Kate Spade are done we are
now free to enjoy in New York City I
desperately need a manicure because
since I had a shellac taken off my nails
it very weak and they keep chipping and
I research this place on Instagram it's
called paint box it looks really really
cool so looked in for a mani
that's what these nails out
so it is a little bit later on now is
that time first of all starting to get
dark Charlie and I have just snuck in
some quick outfit photos had my nails
done a paint box and they look lovely
and now we're actually heading back to
the Crosby Street Hotel grabbing our
bags and moving on to our next hotel
which is the very very Instagram below
11 Howard Hotel so looking forward to
seeing what our room is like that
we've just had a delicious dinner in
choice favorite New York restaurant
where do we go - pika Pik complete
mastery yes it was absolutely great
vegetarian restaurant we came out and we
both decided that we were pretty much
ready to head straight back to the hotel
for bed and then embarrassingly I then
checked what time it was 20 to 7:00 that
is how hardcore we are and you limit
we've been up we've been up at 5:30 6:00
a.m. we have the Suites
nobody shot you scab yep I will there's
a CVC was it yes all right that's good
CBS
good morning it's our third and final
morning in New York today I'm wearing
the world's cutest earmuffs
but they do make it quite hard here and
I'm sewing so Charlie nine this morning
have already had a really lovely
breakfast I would place a call to two
hands which you research last time we
came in today yeah it's really popular
in Australia yeah so they do amazing
coffee yeah kind of quite different as
well I had like corn frittatas yeah yeah
and now we're just heading out
we're heading to Greenwich Village could
it take some nice photos and they were
heading back to our hotel changing
outfit one more time I'm gonna spin
arrested day just exploring and
holiday dinner too
a bit later on in the day now Charlie
and I have checked out of our hotels
were changed quickly and we're now
feeling peckish and as usual chosen our
lunch spots based upon how pretty Liz
and we found a place called the saucer
which we have been as with food the
other stroller which we drove past a
couple of times and thought it looked
really lovely it's my dream food so
after basic
I'm out of Club Monaco and I have a
little bit of a shopping dilemma I tried
on out of pure curiosity this night pink
shearling coat and it was pretty much
the most expensive thing in the whole
store but I totally fell in love with it
so I'm doing my usual thing where I
leave the store have a little think
about it and then if I go back later and
it's still there because someone else is
actually trying on the size that I
needed but still there then maybe it's
meant to be but so Charlie nine evening
tonight we're making the most of every
last-minute heading up to the Central
Park area of Madison Avenue now to do a
little bit more shopping anywhere else
you wanna shop darling I'm all good I'm
Monaco they've got 20% off coats today
which makes my coat decision even
trickier so we're heading to Tory Burch
I also want to go to like Saks and
Bergdorf Goodman on that little corner
and also the Apple Store cuz I think I'm
gonna get the iPhone X is much cheaper
over here I might get a case iPhone case
I already got a kid speed one to the I
Phi X I planned ahead
I just stopped me just a second just a
sec get away from all the pain you told
me if I leave to no one games and it
feels like you smashed me with a hammer
I'm ready to see without a part I'm
ready to believe you but then you said
hey
you can we are officially all shots out
apparently we have over 20,000 deaths
today which is from crazy so Charlie and
I are ending our final day in New York
City
I could try to get over you
