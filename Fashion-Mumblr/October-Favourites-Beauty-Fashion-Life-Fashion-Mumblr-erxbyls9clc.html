having a lovely day today today is the
day for my October favorites October has
absolutely flown by I don't know about
you but seems like two days ago I was
doing my September favorites but then
2015 this has been the year that has
just gone so quickly every single month
I'm like oh my god I can't leave
September's gone a comedy August has
gone maybe the months are just shorter
than I think they are so this month has
been quite busy for me I've been an
answer now I've been in Switzerland and
I just feel like I've not had too much
time at home to really gather myself and
gather my thoughts I feel like I've got
a lot still to do which means that my
beauty favorites are quite random
there's just a few really cool products
here which I have really been loving
throughout the month of October so
there's not a huge amount of product so
hopefully not gonna be a terribly long
up video I want to start though by
giving a little shout out to this little
guy I didn't include him in my September
favorites and I don't know why because
he is honestly just my favorite thing oh
wow this is little Dexter by the way if
you don't know and he's in that mood
right now he's just really tired
which is my favorite mood of hers
because he just likes to kiss and cuddle
which I'm just I just love so this
little cheeky monkey is my first october
favorite because just just love him so
much
so yeah I just wanted to give a shout
out to the man because he is absolutely
gorgeous and I feel really bad for not
mentioning him in my in my September
favorites so I had to mention him you
can so had to mention him in my /
favorites cuz they loved him so much
so my first actual product favorite is
this so you might have seen blogs or few
instagrams that the l'oreal esteem card
has been relaunched i think i think of a
spin quite recently and they definitely
had a steam code before but it was black
and it wasn't just wasn't very
attractive so l'oreal of relaunched
their steam cod and I actually filmed an
entire review and tutorial video for
this so if you are interested in getting
a new straightening for Christmas or if
you just want to know why I have ditched
my old straighteners in favor of the
l'oreal steamed cod then definitely give
that video watch because this seriously
I credit this to why my hair is a little
bit shinier and softer than it was
before previously I would never just
straighten my hair and leave it because
it would just fall flat and be really
kind of gross looking but now that I've
been using the Loreal steam pod I just
love having my hair down and straight
even on days and I'm not doing anything
I will just have my hair like this
because it's so easy to do and it
doesn't damage the hair anywhere near as
much as a normal straighteners but
anyway if you want to know more about
this and definitely check out the review
how do you recommend watching a video
it's really short and yet basically
that's you know why I'm obsessed with
this and then also within haircare I
have been loving the new olio radiance
illuminates I've got the shampoo and the
conditioner and I've been using them
both together I'd say maybe once or
twice a week and I found that my hair is
being a lot more in general like these
with the steam pod dream combination
because I found my hair is even though
it's getting try and harsher outside
normally this time of year my he'll be
getting dry and frizzy but just with
these I found my hair is lovely it's
still really lightweight and glossy
which if you all know blonde hair you'll
know is actually really really rare and
using the best shampoo and conditioner
so I found that my hair just
like so much more healthier it's got
natural shine to it I've never found
that shine products really do much of my
hair so I have to actually treat my hair
with some products which will just give
it a natural shine which it needs to
definitely do so if you found that your
hair is just lacking about nourishment
now the weather's changing and I highly
recommend these two they're not terribly
expensive and I just have found that
more than previous shampoos and
conditioners they've actually made a
real difference to my hair and if you
particularly like using oils in your
hair if you really like the nourishment
then the oil provides then I'm sure that
you are absolutely in love these so
they're my haircare favourites a couple
of like cool things which I really have
credited to my hair just being shinier
than I think it's ever been ever
basically so I'm really pleased with my
hair care routine at the moment so
haircare all the way I have been
actually keeping my skincare routine
pretty simple this month I've as you
probably know I cuticle mother had this
weird rash on my nose under my cheek
area so I've been trying to keep my skin
care routine quite simple but with the
changing weather I've had to be a little
bit more hydrating and add some more
moisture into my skin so I've been using
the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream this
is from John Lewis and I find that it's
just it's exactly what my skin has been
craving now that it's a little bit upset
it just helps to soothe my skin and add
in the real moist of the needs but
without it being greasy or shiny and I
don't need to wait ten minutes before I
put my makeup on because this just sinks
in almost straightaway it's a really
lovely like thick consistency so it
really feels like a luxurious cream when
you put it on your skin and also the
packaging is so gorgeous with this rose
gold lid and kind of like gems style and
hot apps that you love this and I think
it has like in the long run been really
good for curing that bit of weird skin
going on there as well so with a very
simple cleansing routine sometimes I've
been skipping the serum altogether and
just putting this straight on my skin
and I feel that on the mornings and I
don't use it my skin craves
so I just know that my skin has been
absolutely loving this and then because
it is autumn but I'm just not ready to
get rid of my summer tan just yet I've
been using a new product from LMS and
this is their total glow bronzing and
moisturizer for the face I've been
putting this on maybe once every three
days and I find that it just helps to
keep my skin looking a little bit warmer
give my skin a tiny bit of a tan but
without being too obvious
so by using this a couple times a week
I've been keeping it looking nice and
bright and warm and healthy and not
getting all pale and gray like this time
of year sometimes brings on for your
complexion
what I love about this one in particular
is that it has got some skincare
ingredients in it as well so it helps to
soothe the skin and also it's really
good for antioxidant protection so if
you live in the city and you don't want
the pollution to be messing up your skin
and this is a really good one so you're
not forfeiting any skincare ingredients
or benefits from using your fake tan so
this I'd say is like best of both skin
care and tanning all-in-one so really
enjoying using the LMS gradual turn the
fragrance as well goddess the fragrance
and consistency of this is more like a
luxury face cream rather than a tanning
product so even if you were quite if you
even if you're normally quite against
fake town on your face especially before
bed or during the day then you really
won't find this offensive at all in fact
I really like the fragrance of this it's
kind of floral but again not
overpowering in the slightest so it
really is just the best of both between
skincare and tanning and I really really
really like this then I've got a
fragrance favourite and I haven't had a
fragrance favourite in quite a long time
so this isn't taken there's something
quite special to make it worthy of
coming into my favourites and it is the
Tom Ford noir perfume this I've had for
about 3 weeks now and honestly I feel
like it's become my signature perfume
it's got such a lovely very um you can
tell us like a very elegant classy
perfume so you have to describe the
fragrance I'm so bad at describing
fragrances you basically just need to go
and smell this and a perfume counter to
understand why it is so special
is one of those instantly recognizable
perfumes so if anybody else is wearing
it for now instantly know that an assist
perfume is probably um I think that's
definitely some amber notes in there and
it's very would you deep fragrance it's
not sweet in the slightest often you can
tell by the bottle how like elegant and
sophisticated looks you can almost tell
what it's gonna smell like almost UD I
really don't want to describe it too
much in case I'm getting the ingredients
wrong but you basically just need to
smell this because it really is
heavenly and yeah it's quickly become my
everyday fragrance and perfect for
autumn/winter it's got a very lovely
warm smell to it as well so absolutely
loving that one and then a few beauty
products and the first thing that I've
been loving is the Becca what's it
called the Becca ombre Rouge eye palette
I featured this in an autumnal makeup
look although I'm not sure about going
live yet so I'll link it down below if
it has or when it does and it's
basically got five different shades in
it which are kind of pinky orange you
purple shades which are exactly what
I've been wanting to use at the moment
so it gives a really lovely warm look to
the eye area especially if you've got
green eyes I think these are just
absolutely perfect shades and especially
like these two here I think just look so
stunning when you build up like an
almost perfectly brown smokey eye
I don't normally stray too far away from
brown eyes I just I'm a very brown eye
shadow loving kind of girl but this
palette has almost changed that and I've
been finding myself being a little bit
more adventurous and building up purple
smokey eyes thanks to this the shadows
themselves are quite flakey so not when
they're on the eye but when they're in
the in the pot they do tend to dust
quite badly so you have to make sure you
really swipe the excess off the brush
otherwise you're just gonna have the
most powerful eye shade ever but if you
do make sure you tap the brush off and
you get the right amount on your brush
then they have the most lovely
consistency gorgeous color payoff and is
so bendable it's so easy to build a
purple smokey eye and I'm not making
artists I'm not the best
the bother doing smoky eye but it's just
so easy and easy to make a lovely smoky
eye with this set so while I've been
using these two to build up the purple
smokey eye I've been using these two on
more than everyday basis and then this
light one is really good for the brow
bone as well so if you're looking for a
little tundle eyeshadow palette that
this one from becca
highly recommend definitely try it and
get yourself one of the ears and
randomly I have a brush in my makeup
favorites as well so this is the
Charlotte Tilbury bronzing brush
previously I used the Bobbi Brown
bronzing brush and this is just a whole
nother level Charlotte Tilbury can do no
wrong even her brushes I just absolute
brush perfection I swear it even smells
good but that might be the do your
bronzer that I put on this morning I
just find that my bronzer has been going
on so much more so much more perfectly
using this brush and it is expensive
from makeup brush there definitely may
be one for the Christmas list or one
worth saving up for because I think this
will last a long time
I rarely switch out my makeup brushes so
it's quite a big deal that I've been
using this one recently and yeah
absolutely loving it this one and then
just two more pieces and firstly another
one from Tom Ford and this is their brow
sculpting pencil I never thought that
I'd be including like a wind-up waxy
kind of pencil in my favourites I
previously didn't actually really like
them I've been put off by them on but
this one it just looks so natural I find
that I've been using it every day for
I'm wearing it right now it's the
perfect color for my eyebrows I've got
the shade o to taupe which is absolutely
my perfect match but more importantly I
just love the effect that it gets I find
I get all my brows to look colored in at
all so this just adds color and shading
but without looking as though I've just
painted in or penciled in some brows so
I really love the effect that this
little wax I have know some gifts and
then it's also got a spoolie in the end
so you can just finish off your brows by
combing through and because this part of
it is quite waxy I find that it almost
sets the brown place as well so you
really don't need anything other than
this for your brows and I have just been
obsessed with it and that's
the reason why it's my favourites is not
only cuz it's great but because it
surprised me so much and really changed
how I think about this kind of eyebrow
pencil and last but not least it's the
Urban Decay matte revolution lipstick in
the shade
so I think it was in last month's
favorites or maybe even August favorites
I've featured two other Urban Decay
lipsticks and the formula for this is
the same as the ones I featured
previously so I absolutely love the
creamy but matte but not too matte and
definitely very moisturizing consistency
of the Urban Decay matte revolution
lipsticks but as you can see it's the
one I'm wearing right now as you can see
it's a very dark or tumbled color but I
think it's such a wearable dark color
normally with deep berries and plums I
find them very hard to wear you just
have to be so careful with you wear them
with most of something about this shade
that I find it goes with everything it's
not the easiest to apply though you
definitely need to use the lip brush and
potentially in a lip liner as well
because as it's so dark it really does
require quite a steady hand and not
rushing when you're applying it so we're
spending a bit of time applying this but
when it's on apps that you love it I
really like it with this mustard shade
as well actually I think this is
definitely my favorite kind of look at
this time of year but yeah this is
absolute gorgeous there is also a sheer
shame as well which is equally as nice
with not quite as heavy finish so if you
want to give this kind of look and go
but you're a little bit scared of coming
such a bold color and definitely give
these sheer shame ago as well so that's
it I've got through all the little
products that are on my bed at the
moment they all the things that I've
been loving this month don't feel like
you had a terribly exciting favourites
but they are just genuinely the things
of the most been unused and loved by me
this one especially little Dexter who's
curled up asleep Nick
