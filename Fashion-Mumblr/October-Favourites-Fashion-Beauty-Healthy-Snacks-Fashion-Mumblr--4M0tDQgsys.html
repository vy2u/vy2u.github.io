for joining me for today's video which
is going to be my October favorites it
actually feels like forever ago that I
filmed my September favorites in fact
I'm not even sure if I did film when it
just feels like so long since I filmed a
favorites video so we have quite a lot
to catch up on I really hope you guys
enjoyed October I guess you kind of know
what I've been loving throughout the
month of blog tow books it's probably
the things that I talked about in most
of my videos so if you did keep up with
my vlogs then chances are none of this
will come as a surprise to you if you
didn't catch all my vlogs then I'll
leave a vlog to a playlist down below
and you can catch up on what I got up to
during the month it was really fun and
busy month so yeah lots of exciting
things going on before I get started I
would just like to say hello to anybody
that might be new to my youtube channel
if you are then hello thank so much for
joining us and I'd love it if you would
subscribe if you don't want to miss any
more videos from me you'll find tons of
fashion beauty travel lifestyle all that
kind of goodness here on my channel so
just hit that red button if you don't
want to miss anything from me
in November I've got quite a few fun
trips coming up so I'd love to take you
guys along with me at least two videos a
week hopefully three or four sometimes
even five depending on how many vlogs I
get done so yeah it's gonna be a month
of lots of exciting things and lots
exciting videos so definitely be sure to
be subscribed if you are not already so
you don't miss any videos so I'm going
to kick off my October favorites with a
few fashion favorites and to be honest
none of these are going to come as a
surprise to you guys if you follow me on
instagram that is for sure
and I mean you guys knew this was going
to feature at some point during this
video so I might as well get it out the
way this is my Gucci dionysus blooms
handbag and I'm sorry about the
instagrams farm Charlie keeps saying to
me Josie you need to like change up your
Instagram because you're featuring the
bag too much but I'm sorry I just
absolutely love it and when I invest in
apiece I want to get the maximum use
outfit that I possibly can so I've been
using this as my everyday handbag
how long ago do I get it like two or
three weeks and it still is in perfect
good as new conditions so despite the
fact that it's been used every single
day I just absolutely adore it you may
have actually seen me tweet this but
since I bought this handbag I'm gonna
put it down so it's actually fairly
happy it's got all my stuff in it the
bag has actually gone up by around 200
pounds since I bought it which I know is
really annoying if you guys wanted to
invest in it because it's gone up in
price but I think that just shows that
it's a really timeless piece it's a
classic and definitely an investment
piece in my wardrobe so I absolutely
have no regrets buying this and I did
film an unboxing video so if you'd like
to see a little bit more about the bag
some close-ups some information about
the bag and also my first impressions
then I'll leave the unboxing video it
down below and if I can figure out how
to do it I'll put like a video clip on
the screen but if I'm just waving to
myself it means I haven't figured out
how to do that bit so yes my lovely
Gucci Dionysos is my first and my most
favoritest thing throughout this month
and let me know if you'd also like to
see a what's in my handbag because it is
surprising how much I can fit in there
so if you'd like to see what's in my
handbag or what fits inside the Gucci
Darnassus then let me know and I shall
do that for you guys sticking it with
the fashion themes start with my second
monthly favourites of October was his
pair of boots and you probably saw these
in I think is an asus unboxing video or
definitely a source unboxings does where
they're from these are actually mango
boots and mango is having a really good
season at the moment I've got my eye on
a few pieces from the new premium
collection so if anyone's tried that
collection out then let me know some
really interested to see if it is as
premium as the price tag but these boots
are a classic black boot with this
really lovely circle detail which in my
opinion makes them look a little bit
more high-end and I
you get a lot of compliments when I wear
these I think they're just a very
classic style with this lovely
additional design detail also for me
this heel height is really good I'd say
that's about a 4 inch heel which gives
little people like me the boost that we
need but without being too high so I can
wear these all day and not be
uncomfortable so I probably say that
these are my most worn Footwear
throughout the month of October and
they'll continue to be wearing them
throughout the rest of winter I'm kind
of considering investing in a pair of
Gucci boots
but the ones I really wanted they're
black with a little kind of Scott for
the front and then the Gucci badge on it
they sold out in the suffragists
net-a-porter but I'm kind of thinking
about getting them because black boots
are another investment piece
but yeah it's a lot of money but let me
know what you guys think if anybody's
got them then let me know because it is
something that I'm seriously considering
next is a coat and this one is kind of
like a coat slash cape and it's from
coast and before a few weeks ago I never
really thought about coast as somewhere
that I love to shop but then when I saw
this Cape I think it was part of these
styled by Olivia Palermo collection I
suddenly was like oh my gosh they have
so many beautiful things in there and
you're going to seeing a lot more from
them on my channels in the coming weeks
and months so yeah really excited about
that but this Cape is just absolutely
stunning I can't quite decide whether
this is a cape or a coat I'll insert a
photo of me wearing it right here as you
can see what I mean but basically it has
Cape fabric over on the arms but then it
does have button detail down the middle
and you can tie the waist in it so
because of that it does still give you a
really lovely figure
really lovely silhouette because you do
draw it in at the waist but I feel that
the sleeves were the Cape detail just
make it look so glamorous when I first
tried it on in the fitting room I said I
feel like this is a Fashion Week outfit
and I really do feel very fashionable
when I wear this and it's so lovely and
warm the lining is kind of this silky
material so it feels really luxurious on
the skin you've got this really nice I
know it's just a small detail but
really nice gold chain for hanging it up
and yeah I've just been really really
loving wearing this I think it really
elevates an outfit and as where is the
part of your outfit that you see during
autumn and winter so I think it is worth
investing in at this so I will leave a
link to this Cape and a link to
absolutely everything that I mentioned
in this video in the description box
down below as always as well as links to
what I'm wearing and like yeah you guys
know the drill so yeah if you want to
shop any of these pieces including this
beautiful cake there will be links down
below so check out the description box
if you would like some more information
my final fashion favorite is actually an
accessory favorite and it's my current
bracelet selection so I'm going to
insert a close-up because you definitely
won't be able to see from where you are
but basically I have been wearing this
little cluster of three bracelets
throughout the whole month and I just
absolutely adore them they're all such
delicate thin chains I just think
they're really lovely and elegant and
ladylike just very simple and easy to
wear as everyday jewelry but they're
also beautiful enough to be worn during
the evenings as well the silver and the
gold really skinny chains they are both
from the Tembo collection by all right
Julie and also a collaboration with my
friend Kelly from the blog at the London
chatter basically all the profits from
this collection will be going to four
ranges which is a charity that helps the
Rangers spend their whole lives
protecting elephants against poaching
and you might have seen in a vlog I will
leave this vlog linked down below so
it's so fascinating but basically if
elephants continue to be hunted and
killed at the current rate we won't have
any elephants left in the world by 2020
which is just a horrific horrific
thought so it's just so fabulous what
the girls and guys are doing with this
collection to raise awareness but also
raise money for such an important
charity is bracelets retail from I think
it's around 5060 pounds
but as well as the bracelet you also get
the donation that's so for
I suppose I think it's such a lovely
idea if you know anybody that loves
simple delicate jewelry but also maybe
it's a kind of person who's really hard
to buy for maybe its kind of person that
has it all and it's just impossible to
get anything that they don't already
have something like that because you're
giving them a bracelet and also a
donation to such a wonderful charity I
think that was just the best gift so in
case you can't tell I'm getting a little
bit and hats off about this bus because
I know that a lot of my friends and
family will be getting a bracelet from
the Tembo collection for Christmas
because yeah everything about it I just
absolutely adore and then this final one
which is a slightly thicker chain with a
big gold disc with the letter J engraved
on it and this pink stone this is from a
brand called merci maman and the
bracelets that I usually wear on this
wrist I don't know where it is at the
moment and it's from merci maman it's a
brand that I've been wearing for like
three or four years and their new
collection is just so much more dainty
and feminine with the gemstones it's so
beautiful
so yeah this little cluster has been my
wrist favorites for this month
my next favorite I guess you could kind
of say fashion but it's home fashion and
it is this pair of slippers these are
from jewels and I mean they've got
sausage dogs on them or a sausage dog on
them you might have seen again these I
unbox them in a vlog and I had lots of
help from Dexter but you guys know me I
love anything with sausage dogs on them
and I love slippers because I work from
home so I wear slippers all the time and
this sausage looks like Dexter I just
think they're so fabulous they're really
really comfortable and yeah I just had
to include these in my October favorites
because it just all the dogs and now
finally we're going to move on to beauty
and actually this is a very small
category this month don't really have
any particular reason why I think it's
just that only a couple of products
really got me excited this month firstly
is the new skincare range from dolphin
this is the
yeah essential that range from Dafa and
it's all about bringing oil into a
skincare routine but not directly
through oil if that makes sense
so the serum has got essential oils just
really tiny pearls of essential oil
suspended within it and it's also a
really lovely hydrating serum so I think
this time of year when it's getting a
little bit gross outside and maybe we
are potentially losing that glow in our
skin oils are such a great way of
putting it back in there but I know that
oils aren't for everyone personally I
love them but yeah this ring dis of
people that want to have the benefits of
oils but don't want to put an oil
directly onto their skin so got the
serum and also the moisturizer this
moisturizer is kind of more of a gel
cream so even if you have oily
combination skin like myself you can
still use this as your everyday
moisturizer personally I absolutely love
the finish of this somehow it still
gives me a beautiful illumination to the
skin and a really nice healthy glow
despite the part of the weather's
rubbish and despite the fact that it's
also a little bit mattifying which just
makes it a really lovely base for my
makeup so don't have anything negative
to say about this range I kind of knew I
would love it I just dolphin is one of
my all-time skincare ranges skincare
brands and this range is brand-new and
didn't disappoint absolutely love it
leather packaging some of the fragrance
look that it works so yeah this is my
main Beauty favorite of September and
this second one proves that for me did I
say September October this is second one
proves that for me October was all about
trying to maintain the glow in my skin
because my second Beauty favorite is the
luminous silk foundation from Giorgio
Armani and I actually had this in my
makeup collection for quite a while
before I started to use it as my
everyday foundation and since I started
to use it as my everyday foundation I've
had so many
compliments on my skin and I do credit
that also to the dolphin skincare I know
that foundation is fabulous but it
really is your skincare that helps you
to get that beautiful glow as well but
the two together or the three together
really do just I just absolutely love
the way that my complexion looks when I
use this combination and if the
consistency of this it's enough coverage
without being cakey and I've actually
had a few emails from you guys recently
asking what a higher-end foundation you
would recommend if you do have a
slightly higher budget then I would say
this I just absolutely love it I still
love my girl on terra cotta and I still
love my Karin's BB skin detox but at the
moment news my kind of everyday makeup
routine is this one and I'm just totally
in love now I finally see what all the
beauty bloggers hype is about my second
last favorite is fairly random and it is
these raw cacao and like goji berry
almond bite things which I actually made
for the first time with Madeleine sha I
did a video with how we made some
healthy snacks and these are like
beautifying healthy chocolate bars so
really really lovely and delicious I
cannot stress how tasting these are even
Charlie who doesn't really like anything
that I make
he has been snacking on these far too
regularly for my liking
um but yeah obviously these are not the
ones I made with Madeleine because they
were long gone I actually made these a
few days ago they last about two weeks
in the fridge but what they should do
but they never do so I always eat them
before them but when I do work from home
I like to have healthy snacks lying
around because if there were donuts some
crisps lying around I would eat them so
I like to make a batch of these on
Sundays or whenever I have a bit of free
time and they're just so lovely to snack
on while you're having a cup of coffee
or a cup of tea or even at that like
four o'clock energy slump time is really
nice to grab something like this because
it contains nuts it contains berries so
really good for giving you a natural
energy boost without having to go down
the sugar route if you want to see how I
made these I will leave the video with
Madeleine down
and definitely recommend trying it out
so easy to make you literally share
everything in a blender and blended up
Pat it down into a baking tray and then
cut it up is as easy as that and they're
so tasty I'm still really good for you
as well so yeah my beautifying goji
berry raw cacao bites are my second to
last October favorite and finally I
don't know if you guys remember I think
I've forgotten to do in the past two or
maybe even three months favorites but I
did start to do my favorite bloggers men
of the month and I do remember that you
guys seem to really really like that
category so I'm bringing it back and
mostly because I just totally fell in
love with this you may recognize this
from my blogger mail haul I didn't
unboxing video and this is the Zoe bag
from zoeva as this is an absolutely
ginormous three section makeup bag or
make up a brush bag and not only did
they send me the bag but also a
humungous collection of the rose golden
brushes inside it so not only is this a
favorite blogger mail of the month but
also just a favorite product in general
I'm so excited to start using this I'm
not going to show you what's inside
because I'm actually going to film like
a what's in my holiday bag because I'm
going away next week so you'll get to
see all the what's inside this and like
what kind of products I've chosen and in
detail what it looks like inside but I
just had to give this a mention I'll
leave a link down below actually thing
this comes out until November the 14th
for when that day comes I'll even link
it down below to where you can shop this
because it's so fabulous I think that if
I wasn't so lucky enough to have
received it it would definitely go on my
Christmas wish list because it's such a
like beauty lovers essential it's so dry
anonymous it's all of your makeup
products and even if you don't travel
too much maybe to use as like your
everyday makeup bag for keeping at home
obviously
like a comeback version I just love it I
cannot rave about this knife enough the
Rose got details I love the size of it I
just love the brushes you guys know what
huge fan I am off so even touches so to
have this whole set it's just a
treatment cut my trick so thank you so
much so ever still can't actually
believe this it's mine and that is
everything so I really hope you guys
enjoyed looking through all these
products for me the things that I've
been lying throughout the month of
October and I hope you guys are excited
