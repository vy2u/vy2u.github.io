joining me for today's video which is
going to be an unboxing of some beauty
advent calendars so I featured a couple
of these on an unboxing video recently
which I'll link down below which was a
blogger mail unboxing and a lot of you
guys wanted to know a lot more about the
beauty event Kinder's and I mentioned
that I would talk about it in like
middle to end of November but actually
these calendars are out now a lot of
them and they sell out super super
quickly so I thought by November they're
going to be gone so that's why you're
seeing this festive video a little bit
earlier than you might expect to see
them because if you guys like what you
see then yes you need to put them on
your wish list and hope that somebody
treats you to them pretty sharpish
because these are always so so popular
and they do sell out having said that
because it's early I obviously don't
have every single Beauty advent calendar
not all of them are released yet so if I
do happen to get any more Beauty advent
calendars and they haven't sold out by
the time I get them I will potentially
do a part two of this view so let me
know if that's something you like to see
and if there are any specific advent
calendars that you're really excited to
have a little sneak peek into then let
me know and I'll try my best to get them
so the kindest I have today I will just
whisk through what they are so I have
got calendars from first of all dirty
works so this is a kind of shower gel
skincare type one then I have one from
Elizabeth Arden and this is their I
heart
eight hour one however I feel like this
is chocolate because it says linked with
it so yeah I think this is not
necessarily beauty on calendar but it's
from a beauty brand I also have the
Clarins beauty delights event calendar
so more luxury one this one that
contains lots of minis of clarence
products and I've got the L'Occitane on
the calendar so this has got tons and
tons of pieces in it so I'm excited a
little drama tree
that lots of minis of the L'Occitane
products then as you saw in mine boxing
video I've got the body shop 24 Happy
Days calendar this is by far the biggest
so I'm going to have a little look in a
few of the doors in that one I also have
the Charlotte Tilbury Charlotte's world
of legendary parties calendar this one
I'm very excited about because I was
really got so diminished by one last
year because I think they sold out
within I don't know really really
quickly so yes really excited to have it
on this year and then last but not least
I have the nukes ten of beauty treasures
so those are the calendars I'm going to
be opening up not sure if to open up
every single door that might kind of
ruin a surprise maybe I just open up a
few doors so you can get a little idea
as to what is inside the calendars as
I'm holding this one why not start with
it so this is the nukes calendar on the
front you've got a kind of a sketch of
and actually looks like some pause but I
feel like it's probably a French town
because I was his French brand and
inside it opens up like a book and
inside is another beautiful drawing so
this looks like a little street perhaps
a shopping street in Pali and you've got
the windows at the top and you've got
the little shop fronts down at the
bottom so I'm just going to pick some
random doors I'm going to take number
five so let's see what is in here really
nice quality by the way really stiff
cardboard so it's not going to rip all
over the place so inside it's not a mini
mini it's actually a decent-sized mini
this is a 15 mil of the gentle
exfoliating gel with rose petals this is
such a gorgeous one you're going to hear
me say this a lot but so good for
traveling to have these many sizes
I always keep like a shoebox under my
bed to keep all these little things in
and nooks products are just absolute
had me and still nice and gentle on the
skin so good for good for traveling
let's take number ten this is a really
really big one so look at there that is
such a good size oh my gosh this is
their multi-purpose oil and this if I
remember correctly it smells absolutely
gorgeous I've never owned one of their
plane oils before I've got the one with
the gold flecks in which just is heaven
for beach holidays but this is our
multi-purpose so you could put this on
the ends of your hair you could use it
on your body
it's part of your beauty routine let's
have a little smell I'm excited to see
if this smells as good as I think it's
going to it's so lovely in light really
really light fragrance so nice and is it
a hundred yeah it's only 30 mils so once
again if you're traveling hand luggage
that will be absolutely perfect and what
else I'm going to open this one on the
end here this is number two really
really carefully bam and this oh I've
just noticed that inside the door it
tells you a little bit more about the
product so this is the creme produ use
anti fatigue
anti stress solution for your skin on
'back today a late one last night so I
like sound of this oh wait that doesn't
actually correlate to what's in the door
that's really random this is a hand and
nail cream rev damião ooh I've heard a
lot about this this is a cult product
this is such a good way of trying like
the favorites from the brand I guess
they just stick the most popular things
in there to give you a chance to try
them this is super sized for my handbag
my new handbag if you saw a recent
unboxing video such a lovely size and
especially this time of year I love to
have and cream in my handbags I do get
really dry hands so I'm actually not
going to put that back in the kind I'm
going to keep that one out so in the
interest of not making this video about
four hours long I'm not going to open
every door and every calendar it's just
to give you a little glimpse as to
what's inside and also then if you guys
do end up buying these calendars then
it's not going to talk you ruin the fun
for you so I hope you don't mind I'm
just go
open three or four depending on how
carried away I get in each calendar the
next one that I've reached for is
Clarins and this comes in its own little
protective sleeve and then you've got
this big white box very very Clarins
branding I just love it Clarence
Christmas just just love so much and
they've got iced sugar biscuits on the
front of their design in the bauble
macaroons so a very sweet treat style
advent calendar once again opens up
inside more of these beautiful baubles
funny that is actually not very Clarence
brand if the only clue you've got is the
sign on there there's no Clarence
branding in here at all it's just for
balls
you could always like leave this leaning
against your mantelpiece and have it as
a decoration it's just such a beautiful
design and actually unlike the past one
which was 10 this has 24 yeah 24 doors
so you get to open it every day leading
up to Christmas so let's have a look why
should we start I'm going to take number
three let's have a look all lulala like
a look at this a little bit hard to get
out remember one kind I had last year oh
it was um I think I see accessorized
nail varnish one I could not get those
nail varnishes out has like destroy the
calendar to get them out this is the
toning lotion with caramel oh I just
I've been really loving how more
recently it's just got such lovely
calming effects and I've not tried this
product before I've tried a lot of
clients but I haven't tried this before
that's an exciting one to give a cry of
and really good if you want to just test
some things out before you purchase a
full-size it's a really good way of
doing that oh and I should have said
earlier and the information for how much
they are and whether they're out now or
when they'll release I'm going to put on
screen and but also all the information
and links to where you can buy them
online will be in the description box so
check that out for full information
this one is teeny teeny tiny so I'm
going open number 11 to see what tiny
treat they've put in there oh I think I
already have one of these I just love it
it's actually just run out this is a
miniature of their blue
kid facial oil and this is a heavenly
product it's fairly pricey so fabulous
to try it in this little tiny version
sorry if the camera angle just changed
slightly I had to go and switch my
battery pack that's rather annoying back
to the Blue Orchid facial oil this I
actually have a slightly bigger version
than this
think I must have got it in a goodie bag
or something and all free gift with
purchase I keep it in my aeroplane bag
because I love as I'm sure you guys know
if you've seen my in-flight beauty
routine I love to pamper myself and I'm
flying and a facial oil for me is just
such an Aquarius thing to use and I feel
like it protects my skin from any
dryness or any nasties in the air while
I'm on the plane so this is definitely
going to go in my travel bag but for now
popping it back inside its door then
what else should I do let's have a look
at number 20 so can you get closer to
Christmas oh yes oh I'm very very
excited to see this in here this is a
product that actually I've also finished
recently and it's their instant light
radiance boosting complexion base so
this is just such a lovely it's kind of
a primer but it's more that it gives you
a beautiful glow but not a shiny glow
for your makeup so absolutely gorgeous
this kind of thing I almost feel is an
additional step in your beauty routine
so normally when I travel I don't take
things like this but because it's such a
cute little size I'll definitely be
putting that in my travel makeup bag and
I love that the packaging is just still
so luxurious even though it may be a
mini it just still looks absolutely
beautiful as you'd expect from Cline so
another gorgeous one in the calendar and
because there's 25 or 24 days I'm going
to open four so now I'm opening up
number 12 this is a brush roller blush
Prodi's illuminating cheek color let's
have
look I'm intrigued to see how they
package this Wow I was not expecting
this to be in the actual Clarins
beautiful gold packaging this is
incredibly luxurious so inside look at
that that is just stunning you've got a
mini Clarence lush that is so beautiful
so luxurious and it's even got the
mirror in the lid as well so they're
really not scrimping on their samples in
here
this is illuminating cheek color Oh too
soft peach which I feel like the suit so
many different skin tones a little bit
of shimmer in that as well so a lovely
warm for the festive season so I've
opened four and that's how it's going to
stay if you want to see what else is in
here
then you'll have to treat yourself and I
think it does have information on the
back yeah this box it does actually tell
you what's inside it so a few others
light lip comfort oil I love the lip
comfort oils moisture punishing lip balm
beauty flash bone now treatment cream
fragrance there are so many amazing
things in here gosh december vlogmas is
going to be seriously exciting this next
one is from a brand called dirty works
and it's as I mentioned earlier kind of
like fun shower gels and soaps and
things like that it does give you an
idea as to what to expect on the back so
yes I'm just going to go ahead and open
a couple of the doors on the front the
design is a really cute house and it's
just got the kind of vintage retro pinup
ladies peeking out in the windows and
then inside hugely bright turquoise
color and I believe this it has 25 doors
24 once again so Christmas Eve is the
last one to know what I'm going to open
the last one on this because I feel like
that is sometimes the best one so let's
see what they put in here try not to
ground a box as I go
oh look at that I know some things
become dislodged oh I think these are
like bath crystals they've slid around
from another day but Christmas Eve you
are treated to this little start of
shower gel dirty workz shower gel and
doesn't tell you much about it 40 melt
40 mil is a really good size once again
good for traveling I love this little
design it smells
mm I god that smells so much like a
fragrance if I can't put my finger on
what it smells like but that smells
insanely good so you can treat yourself
to a very luxurious shower on Christmas
Eve ready for father Christmas visiting
you let's see what else we've got number
6 i'm fine' shaped by number 6 is an
unusual oblong shape voila
okay we have got a bar so oh gosh this
is so perfect because December is one of
those months where you just want to
spend the evenings chilling out at home
running yourself over what a really
lovely hot bath and yes to be able to
use these pretty much straightaway I
know that this will pretty much only
last meet one bath this is the big
chill-out bath soap let's have a smell
of this one perhaps if you're going to
stay with any family or if you've got
sleepovers these are really good sizes
so you can still pamper yourself while
you are away from home oh I can't get
into it but I'm just gonna guess that it
smells amazing based on how good that
star smelt I think these are so lovely
to open up every single day I get so
excited about both products and it's
almost a good excuse to just make sure
you have a little bit of me time in the
run-up to Christmas and the final one
I'm going to open is number 20 because
it is a circular shape oh haha that has
nothing in it I think it must have slid
around maybe that's where this came from
so this was I think that bath salts Oh
bath caviar so it's
as actually it just says just going to
go to rush this is not food keep out of
reach of children but yeah these are
bath salts once again they smell insane
I'm going to put them back in day number
20 so I presume that's where they came
from so lots of lovely pampering treats
in the dirty workz
advent calendar it's so so nice to open
a little treat like this every single
day in December I love those 24 in there
so many lovely treats next one I'm going
to open up because I can't contain my
excitement any longer is Charlotte
Tilbury and this is a beautiful blush
pink baby pink pops
very very luxurious and you do have a
hint as to what's inside on the back so
I'm not going to spoil it too much I've
not even looked inside this one by the
way yes this is all brand new for me oh
look at this so you have oh gosh
legendary girls need legendary parties
that's what it says on the other side
every woman deserves a man to ruin her
lipstick and not her mascara I like that
that is a good quote and love Charlotte
Tilbury so you have lots of the
Charlotte Tilbury girls painted or
sketched on the individual drawers so
nice of their drawers because it just
makes this the kind of thing that you oh
my god what am I going to store in this
afterwards this be quite nice for
jewelry wouldn't it definitely not the
kind of thing I've been checking out
after Christmas that's for sure it gives
you a little bit of a hint I think as to
what's inside this one it says legendary
lashes so I'm guessing this might be a
mini mascara yes how cute is that
Oh legendary lashes instant volume and
length miracle mascara and I've not
actually tried Charlotte OB mascara
before this is going to be exciting me
in the beautiful deep brown and gold
packaging so so luxurious that's how low
look ah so gorgeous my handbag
really really beautiful size very chunky
and bristly brush is so beautiful oh my
god
I'm just so excited to have a handbag
and travel bag full of English gorgeous
minis
let's put that back in legendary lashes
to be honest this how many are there
three six nine twelve so you got twelve
drawers
you could open them whenever you wanted
to so don't actually have numbers on
them so maybe whenever you feel like
treating yourself you just open up
another drawer or you could save it
until the twelve day countdown to
Christmas let's have a look in this one
it says of gesichert red and inside boom
this looks like it might be a lip balm
or something a square pot looks very
exciting let's have a look apply with
your finger or with a lip brush for more
precision a pocket pout lip color I like
the sound of this I'm not familiar with
this product at all actually so I don't
know if it's a calendar exclusive or if
it's just something I've not seen before
okay I had to shred the box because I
couldn't get into it but inside is this
beautiful this reminds me like a
Scrabble piece that's how how it feels
oh wow is absolutely beautiful this is
the kind of thing that I don't want to
use because it's too stunning so it's a
little block umm and I'm guessing this
is going to be quite an intense lip tint
but the block has got a 3d lip motif on
it so it's just going to be so
satisfying to use that for the first
time but also quite heartbreaking I
don't want to ruin the beautiful and
sight on it a little of mirror in the
lid so great for top ups on the go such
a handy little box that is absolutely
adorable in the shade Jessica red so I
think this will be so nice on like crisp
winter Christmas evenings you just want
to dot some color onto your lips and a
festive red is so perfect that's just
absolutely adorable and then what else
let's have a little look inside eyes to
mesmerize
another square box nice mesmerized
long-lasting easy color like some fat
easy color and in here this is
definitely full size as well that is
incredible
Marie Antoinette is the shade that I've
got in here wow that is so stunning I
feel like they've picked things which
are really good for the festive season
so this dotted into the corner of the
eyes in fact oh wow
that is beautiful that is like a that
color is just stunning I can't wait to
try this out so good for the festive
season and beyond that is absolutely
beautiful it's a liquid mousse II I
shade it says easy color so I'm hoping
that even for something that's not great
in the makeup like me it will be a
really lovely one to try out and so
great this full size as well and I do
one more because it's just so exciting
and I'm going to open up Penelope pink
which is this top chore here and inside
looks like it might be a lipstick it's
so exciting
oh my gosh it's one of their kis s ing
falling from the lipstick tree lipsticks
and I swear this is also full-size is
insane I think last year there were
minis maybe that was the Christmas tree
ones not sure but this is definitely
full size that is amazing oh wow look at
that ah I so stunning such a beautiful
color I think I may already have this
Penelope pink if I do then I've now got
a backup that is so exciting so lovely
to try some of their classic pieces
that's what I love about these calendars
so so gorgeous and I'm going to save the
rest of the little literals for
Christmas so keep an eye on my vlogmas
videos when they finally come about if
you'd like to see me opening some more
of these
this one will sell out I'm pretty sure
so if
you have got this on your wish list then
I would not hang about okie-dokie the
next one I'm going to open up for you
guys is the L'Occitane advent calendar
this one is wrapped in plastics let me
grab some scissors
alright plastic is off and this one is
really tall this feels like proper
advent calendar kind of shape and size
yes I did just hit myself in the head
with this and then you've got a
beautiful red ribbon bow to undo to open
it up on the front once again they are
loving this house design so many of them
so far dirty works and looks and now
this one they've all got the houses on
the front of them and then inside this
is going to be a two hand situation
oh this almost looks like little
gingerbread house it's just a family
going about their Christmas routine in
fact it looks like they're making
products maybe this is inside the
L'Occitane factory this is so cute
oh I love how busy it is it reminded
like where's the body or something so so
cute okay and we have 24 so this is
another very generous one with 24 gifts
inside let's go with number 15 that's my
lucky number okay let's see what's
inside number 15 oh very easy to open I
like that and inside we have a burner
shower gel a very luxurious
L'Occitane shower gel these just smell
so good I absolutely love locks and
shower gels minis are so handy for
trying out new sense especially that is
so refreshing ah that smells like
citrusy but warm at the same time almost
a little bit OD love love love and then
let's go for number seven this is a
longer one that's yours laughing inside
here oh I do not recognize this
packaging this is another shower gel it
is the the T vert taya vert and bigger
raid I've probably said that so wrong
I'm so sorry umm shower gel so another
shower gel Christmas
is going to be full of pampering that is
for sure
let's open number 12 let's see what's in
here
derma FEMA is another shower gel showers
throughout December it's going to be
absolutely insane this one is the
relaxing shower gel so I might even use
this in the bath and just enjoy the
fragrance
oh that's almost lavender E what's in
there yes it's got lavender and fruit
oils citrus oil lots of oils in that one
so really pampering one and I am going
to open one more because I feel like for
shower gels it's just not terribly
exciting um let's open up number four
this interesting this is if I can get
out a refreshing that cloth that is very
unusual I feel like this is the kind of
thing you keep in your handbag and
sometimes if you just need to refresh or
cleanse during the day really really
handy thing to have
I'm winter place sell boxes with
multiple ones of these because I feel
like once that's gone I'm definitely
gonna need it more than once that's
really handy oh I just want to open one
more as well let's open up number 14
that's an unusual shape oh oh I like
Sanders cleansing and exfoliating
delicious soap with or with flaked
almonds
I love almonds so much I just love to
have a luxurious open my downstairs
bathroom I feel like guests feel extra
special when they use a luxury soap and
I bet it's actually making my mouth
water thinking about how good this is
going to smell because I love almonds
almonds and food almonds and perfume
almonds and skincare
almonds so very exciting little prizes
in the lots tan a big calendar I think
this is a really good one for maybe
buying like your mom as well if you can
always destroy aunty because everyone
loves L'Occitane a lot of these are a
little bit younger but I think this one
I know that my mom would ask
love this in fact should I treat her to
one of these I think I might buy one of
these from her because she does
absolutely love lock stands so a really
lovely gift but once again one to grab
soon because they will not be in the
shops for that much longer so this next
one is Elizabeth Arden and as I said
before I think this is just a normal
advent calendar the everything on the
back is a vikander filled with Linda
Linda chocolate from Linda's so heavenly
it is Elizabeth Arden branded one so if
you have got a chocoholic in your family
or one of your friends is a chocoholic
but they do love beauty then this really
is the best of both perhaps you could
treat her to an eight hour hand cream as
well I am going to just open the door
and have a chocolate so I'm going to I'm
gonna open number one because I feel
like maybe I won't miss it so much on
the first of December
ah well as expecting these to be just
like yield squares but they were
actually the proper proper little indels
from lint which I'm just going to have
to wait now ah
I don't know what all different colors
mean I know that red is like the normal
one oh my god oh my god I forgot how
much I love these I have got chocolate
or I'm a prime line that is so good one
of those a day is definitely what you
need throughout December so really
really lovely if you want to buy a
chocolate advent calendar but you are
Connie I taught my mouth is watering so
much from chocolate I forgot how good
Lindt chocolate is that is absolutely
delicious so this is such a nice one if
you just love chocolate and don't want
to give chocolate advocate as a Miss but
you still just love beauties such a nice
one from Elizabeth Arden and just a
little bit more interest than the usual
chocolate advent calendar so that's a
really really nice one from Elizabeth
Arden and lint and I've saved the
biggest till at last this one is in the
body shop advent calendar as I mentioned
in my blog amel and boxing video they
have four different calendars this year
four different price points you can
really choose how extreme you want to go
with your advent calendar
this one is the 24 happy days beauty
lies within one and as you can see just
absolute mega so you need somewhere
pretty impressive to store this I'm
going to have to put it on my dining
table I think it's just going to take up
the whole house and then inside inside
you've got all of these drawers this is
just absolutely insane like about 24
here Wow yeah 24 treats for you to open
up every single day right up until
Christmas Eve so let's start with this
big one up here number two oh it's got a
little motivational message on it as
well it says make today a life-changing
day that is so nice
no clues as to what is inside it feels
really light I'm thinking it's probably
a loofah oh so handy exfoliating gloves
charleen I get through a pair of these
like every two weeks these are the bath
clothes put shower gel on them and it
gives you a really nice exfoliation
great for daily exfoliation is so so so
handy I think I will let Charlie open
this on the 2nd of December and he will
be absolutely thrilled this is going to
be a little bit like Jenga so if I take
number 13 everything's going to slide
down right yeah I guess it doesn't
really matter if things move around a
bit this one says beauty has never
looked so good oh I really like these
expressions it's gonna carry I'm leaning
over the cameras like this inside here
massive box tiny products you've got a
little satin lipstick oh lip and cheek
stain that is not something that I've
tried from the body shop before in pink
hibiscus double oh one such a nice way
of trying new things and what better
time than at Christmas also I think if
you have like young relatives if you've
got maybe a baby niece or a nephew
you could definitely keep a hold of this
and all the boxes and put your own
treats in next year that I think I might
individually wrap little gifts and next
year put a gift inside each of these
pouches and give it to my youngest
nephew and he won't stop so you love
opening these up every single day I
think that's such a nice idea to not
at this beautiful candor go to waste
I'll stick it in the loft for a year I'm
going to open number number 17 this one
says make every moment count and inside
you have got school this is a makeup
brush this is a double-ended very handy
double-ended makeup brush for your eyes
you've got a pointed end and a blending
end it is funny they did not need to
make this calendar as big as they did
but it definitely is dramatic that's
sure last but not least I've got number
19 and this one says beauty for the body
and soul and it's not feels a little bit
heavier than the previous ones so let's
see what is inside here we have got oh
all very nice The Body Shop and British
rose exfoliating gel body scrub that is
so heavenly I love this collection ah oh
my god that makes me just want to get in
the shower right now it's such a good
size as well guys definitely I think it
is a mini but it's still 50ml so really
good size definitely get a few scrubs
out of this one okay let's play a little
game of spot the difference because I'm
filming this bit like four hours after I
filmed the bit that just cut off because
the plumber came to install our
thermostat so sorry about the change in
probably everything lighting makeup etc
so I think I was just finishing talking
about the body shop advent calendar
I cannot remember and if I was in the
middle of opening something or what so
I'm just going to open another one to
try to carry on there's some form of
normality and so let's go with number 18
or did we do that one already now I
don't recognise that same so this one
says goodness makes gorgeous and once
again feels quite light inside let's see
oh we like this color
do you know what I don't really know
that much
a body shop makeup I definitely to try
out a little bit more and this is a lip
definer in the shade pink clover which
looks like my perfect shade so such a
good opportunity for me to try out some
body shop makeup because yeah I'm not
really try that much out before I
absolutely love their skincare their
face masks so ah there's just so many
amazing things to try and this calendar
really is quite spectacular so I've
showed you a good little sneak preview
into a few of this year's beauty advent
calendars I do think they are such a
good idea
I much prefer opening up beauty products
to chocolate and I love chocolate so
that's saying something
