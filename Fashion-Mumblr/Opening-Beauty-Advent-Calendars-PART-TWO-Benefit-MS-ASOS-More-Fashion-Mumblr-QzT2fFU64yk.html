youtube channel and thanks so much for
joining me for today's video which is
going to be my Christmas beauty advent
calendar unboxing part 2 so in case you
missed it I'm going to leave part one
linked down below I opened up calendars
such as The Body Shop Charlotte Tilbury
Clarins and Lowe's loads more in that
video so make sure you check that out if
you would like to see part 1 and part 2
is coming your way now because there are
just so so many beauty event planners on
the market this year so many brands are
bringing out their own calendars and
more than ever the choice is so so so
hard if you do want to pick up an advent
calendar some of them are really
expensive you just don't really know
what you're going to get so hopefully
this video and the previous video will
help you decide which beauty advent
calendar is for you so as I did last
time I'm going to start by just whizzing
over which candles are going to be
featured in this video and then once
again I will open up a few doors to let
you know what kind of things you can
expect to buy inside as the last time
every single link to buy the calendars
will be down below in the description
box and I can't stress this enough so
many of these calendars sell out so so
so quickly so if you do fall in love
with any of them then don't hang around
because I hate for you to be left
disappointed I know a few of them that I
mentioned in last video they have
actually sold out and where possible if
I see them selling out on one website
I'll update the link to website where
they are not sold out yet so definitely
keep an eye on the links below if you
want to shop any of these calendars I've
also decided this year that I'm going to
be giving away every single Beauty
advent calendar and what's inside it so
if you'd like to be in with a chance of
winning and to find out how to enter
then just stick around because I'll be
talking through the giveaway towards the
end of this video so I'm going to get
started by just very quickly whizzing
through the calendars that going to be
featured in this video firstly I have
got the benefit Beauty advent calendar
this one I have never had a beauty
advent calendar from benefit before so
really really excited to see what kind
of bits and bobs are going to be in this
one then I have got these sea art a nail
varnish
money month calendar this one doesn't
really specify that it's a Christmas
calendar it just says many months so I
guess you couldn't technically open this
any time of year but I'm going to save
it for Christmas so that's the mini
Manny month from ciate then we have an
absolutely gianormous one this is the
beauty secret from look fantastic this
one was actually my first ever beauty
advent calendar before I was even
blogging or maybe I'd only just started
blogging Charlie actually bought me this
one for me to have as my beauty advent
calendar so it'll always hold a special
place in my heart and I just love the
packaging of this year's one it's like
white and rose gold so very much up my
street next I have the century spa let
go days of Christmas I don't really know
what the hashtag let-go is all about but
I'm sure we'll find out this is another
really really big one and by the looks
of it there's going to be a lot of
products inside I think this is probably
a 24 or 25 day calendar then I've got
the a sauce calendar this one I'm really
looking forward to seeing what's inside
there are so many amazing brands stopped
on ASOS so I've got very high hopes for
the ASOS advent calendar next is molten
Brown and this one just looks so so
luxurious I love this dark dark green
it's just so luxurious looking and it's
got these beautiful bells and ribbon on
the front they're very festive and
luxurious one from Alton Brown also
really really heavy and last but not
least this one here is from Marks and
Spencer and I've already had a few
glimpses as to what's inside so I've
seen a few other bloggers and youtubers
going through this one and I have very
very high hopes for this so really
excited to go through the Marks &amp;amp;
Spencer one so let's get started with
the benefit advent calendar this one is
to be honest this is probably the
cheapest packaging looking one it's very
thin cardboard so it doesn't feel as
like high quality as a lot of the others
but hopefully what's inside will make up
for that I do love this lime green pink
very fun packaging and then inside you
but is really oh
you can tell I haven't open that one
before was not expecting that happen and
so you have got a musical jingle going
on inside and you have got twelve okay I
can't open it without it starting sing
but inside we go sneak peek is twelve
days of Christmas oh my god
we seem to have a moment of silence I'm
going to get started by opening up
number nine I just opening these
incomplete random order to switch
everyone's I fancy so you can have a
little it works inside and for day
number nine we have got to the benefit
it's potent eye cream and this is of
course a mini that looks like a really
generous sample size when you consider
that the full size of these isn't
actually that ginormous this is a pretty
generous sample of not too sure how many
milliliters this is but it's that big
and definitely a good one for popping
and not definitely good sized popping in
your travel bag this could come in
really really handy and I like that
they've not done like a cheaper
alternative the packaging it's still in
the glass bottle that you expect to buy
if we got the full size version and
plenty of product inside as well and
I've not actually tried this eye cream
before I've heard loads of really good
things about it so I'm going to really
look forward to giving this a try from
the benefits kinda I could get very
annoying every day during Christmas
gonna go to Karen doing its thing and
I'm gonna open up day number 11 okay so
inside inside day number 11 this is a
really exciting one because I absolutely
love benefit blushes but for traveling
or just even normal storage they are far
too big in those big boxes but this is a
little benefit dandelion blush in this
tiny cute little flat packaging so
really adorable very travel friendly
packaging and yeah the blusher inside
there's no lid of course in the mirror
mirror in the lid like in the proper one
but you can definitely sacrifice that
considering how cute and dinky it is but
this is actually a really good size
so it's only a little bit smaller than
what you would get in the actual
full-size product and baby pink
brightening face powder our house
interesting so says it's a face powder
but I've always used dandelion as a
blusher as anyone uses powder let me
know in the comments if you have done
because I've always use it as a blush
next I'm going to open up number four
I'm trying really hard not to make it
start singing because once it starts it
does not want to stop
aha so in a day number four fourth of
December we have the miniature of their
real mascara now this I have to say you
do actually get these sizes with
magazines sometimes I think it's l often
give benefits armfuls and this is the
same size so actually you could get this
from a magazine if you get one at the
right time having said that I'm still
very grateful to see this in the
calendar because I do love this mascara
is definitely in my top five no score as
ever my top one is actually benefit
roller lash which I just love in brown
it's my current favorite go-to mascara
and but this is really handy to have in
your handbag sometimes up at the gym if
I've got meetings I'm not going home
after the gym before going out this is
so so handy to have in my bag and I do
actually find that you get a lot of use
out of these minis so having said that
you get it from magazines that's
probably me being a bit harsh even
though you do but it's still a very very
handy thing to get inside your advent
calendar and great if you've not tried
it before but warning you will probably
become addicted to it I've also just
realized that the lyrics from the song
inside the calendar is on the back so if
you fancy a little sing-along then here
they are
next let's have a little look at what's
inside the look fantastic beauty secrets
calendar this one is absolutely
ginormous so I have a feeling that
there's going to be quite a lot of
decent sized products in here as I
mentioned before it's just absolutely
beautiful I think this is the most
gorgeous box and definitely one that is
such a shame because I wish they'd done
it as drawers because then I would have
used it um in future years as well
whereas you can't really give someone a
can
that's already been opened but I think
these bits will come out yeah so
actually you could just use it as a
storage box afterwards because anything
rose gold I cannot bring myself to throw
away so this one does actually have 25
days so you do get something to open up
on Christmas Day which I absolutely love
I think it's such a shame to go all the
way up to 24 and then not have anything
to open on Christmas Day itself so I am
going to open up day number 11 because
it's right here in front of me oh I've
ripped it already haha does not look
like something I recognise which is
amazing it's always nice to try new
things
this is Kristoff Robin regenerating mask
with rare prickly pear seed oil now I
don't if this is a face mask and it
applies small amounts after shampooing
so this is a lovely regenerating hair
mask I have a feeling this is actually a
fairly pricey high-end product so by
giving this amount and this is let me
have a look this is a 50 mil so pretty
generous song pull off this product and
it's definitely enough in there for a
couple of washes so it can give you a
good idea
as to whether it is a good product or
not now let's have a look inside date
number three this is actually a really
big one so let's have a little look oh I
think I've actually tried this before
this is just pull it out so inside here
we have a loose mineral blush from a
brand called Innoko and I have tried
this brand before but I don't think I've
tried their blushes I have a feeling it
was just one of their powders that I
tried before and this is a mineral based
brand so the products are really nice
and nourishing for the skin they don't
block up the pores and I'm pretty sure
that this is a brand that not everyone
has heard of so really love you that you
get to try out in your calendar and who
knows could potentially become a new
favorite I guess in that way
Beauty advent calendars are a little bit
like beauty boxes but just intensely in
the month of December because beauty box
is a great way of discovering new brands
and trying
new minis before getting the full-size
version so yeah beauty our calendars are
kind of a better version of monthly
beauty boxes I'm going to open up and
number 23 because this is absolutely
massive and I'm dying to see what's
inside here ah this is really really
handy so this is a mini sachet of Olay
Hendrickson clean truth cleansing cloths
these are just the handiest things in
the world and they smells so so so good
and once again this is a really generous
size for for a beauty advent counter I
think this is probably the same size you
would get in a beauty box but a really
high-end product so very very generous
of look fantastic put those in there and
then because there are 25 days on this
candle I am going to open up one more so
let's have a look let's try a smaller
one this time I'm going to open up a
number one and inside oh gosh this is a
good way to start we have the pixie glow
tonic and this is a real cult product
beauty bloggers absolutely love this and
for good reason it's one of my favorite
toners ever and actually I've run out of
this so I'm going to start using this
little miniature put in my travel bag
honestly after Christmas you never need
to buy travel sizes again because you
have so so many from the calendars I'm
actually still going through with some
Kerastase articles which I got in last
year's and Cara Starr's calendar I don't
know if they're bringing one out this
year I'm not sure you have to you know
if you've seen it so that's all I'm
going to show you from the look
fantastic advent calendar I was really
really impressed with mine last year and
this one I think is going to be a real
treat as well so definitely make sure
that you don't hang around if you want
to get this one I'll leave the link down
below to buy it I think this one is
going to sell out really really soon I
think last year it sold out in like two
weeks so definitely don't hang around
and this is notoriously one of my
favorites and so many amazing brands if
joy numbers is beautiful and yeah
definitely recommend they look fantastic
one next I'm going to have a little look
inside the Marks and Spencer one and
this one I think
as 24 days I can't see number 25
although hum so that I can't see number
24 teeth oh yeah 24 oh my gosh it does
have 25 just spotted Christmas Day here
so lots and lots to open up from the
Marks &amp;amp; Spencer advent calendar I love
the shape of this one it's almost like
its own Christmas decoration really nice
that it stands up as well because
sometimes you just run out of room for
beauty and bed comes they definitely
take up a lot of space especially that
look fantastic one I knew that your own
vlog immerse my dining table is going to
be covered in beauty advent calendars so
that I don't ruin it the Pyramid of this
I'm going to start by taking number 21
and that one was pretty close to the top
this feels quite light so I'm thinking
it might be like a makeup brush or
something that's how I look oh so we
have a parcel within a parcel like a
little house parcel and inside very very
tiny but it's a very good brand this is
the pure correcting primer prep and
perfect and primer is one thing that I
always forget to take with me on a
holiday so I guess if I had one this
tiny then it would remind me to just
stick it in my travel bag or I could
probably just leave it in my travel bag
and if you've never really tried primer
before then this will be a really good
opportunity for you to give it a go for
the first time and see whether your skin
prefers it whether your makeup last
longer and I really do love pure as a
brand I think there are another
mineral-based ones so really good for
preventing your makeup from just
clogging up your skin cells so let's
also have a look in this one this is
number four and it was the pyramid at
the top of the tree another fairly light
one let's have a little look
aha so we have another pixie product we
have the glow tonic in fantastic ones
and this is their brow tamer this
probably is full-sized actually it looks
like a fairly decent generous size and
this is a clear brow gel so something
that everyone can use just tidy up those
brows during festive months and beyond
next I'm going to go for one of these
ones down at the bottom because they're
separated out so it's not going to cause
an avalanche
this one feels like it's got something a
little bit bigger inside I've gone from
number 14
so skills chunky and inside we have got
oh la la we have got a nooks
multi-purpose dry oil I think we had one
of these maybe not quite so big in the
nooks advent calendar that opened in the
last video I absolutely love this and
multi-purpose oil is good for so many
things you got your hair you can use it
because it smells nice it's like a body
lotion on your cuticles absolutely love
this really really handy and you could
always fit this size in your handbag as
well so very impressed with my pieces so
far many M&amp;amp;S calendar and then I'm gonna
go for a number walnut so I feel like
they always put something quite good in
the first day because then it just gives
you something to look forward to for the
rest of the month sets the bar as it
were and inside here we have Neal's Yard
as a lovely yard and also I'm so
impressed with the range from Marks and
Spencer I never would have realized that
Neal's Yard was sold there but this is
their be lovely to your hands hand cream
save the bees that was really really
cute this is kind of a charity one
moisturizing with organic honey blended
with energizing orange I bet this smells
so so good so yes a lovely one to start
off the festivities with Monson Spencer
so having done a lot of research into
different Beauty advent calendars I feel
that this one is a really really good
value it's not one of these ones which
is crazy expensive it's not like a
hundred and fifty pounds and you do
still get a lot of amazing products so
personally I think if I had to choose
one as all the calendars I would
probably go for this one due to its
affordability and range of products but
it totally depends on your preference
and your budget but personally
definitely recommend this one probably
recommend all of them they're also so
nice but yeah this is a favorite next
I'm going to have a look inside the
ciaté
mini money month
and I'm guessing that this is going to
be all now vanishes so a great
opportunity to add some new colors into
your nail varnish collection so the
first thing I'm going to open is number
eight this one as is the others is kind
of like a purple and gold color
really really beautiful colorings and it
has a little quote on the back which
says though she is those should be but
little she is fierce by William
Shakespeare and I had a feeling that
we've seen this quote before really
recently I think it might have been on
one of the bodyshop advent calendars
they also had quotes on them and I may
be wrong but I've definitely heard that
quote really recently so let's have a
look what color we've got inside number
eight this is not a shade that I
currently have in my collection so it's
always nice to have little minis of
these unusual shades which is what this
kind of is really really good for I may
not necessarily go out and bought this
color but if I want to do any nail art
or anything with a bright blue color
it's always handy to have a few
different shades in your collection so
now I have a bright cobalt blue and I'm
intrigued why some of them aren't nail
varnish shaped so I'm going to open
number two which says we're all about
rollers red nails and bran Cotton's I
don't know where that quotes from but
that's the quote behind day number two
and in here uh-huh is another nail
varnish but so I just packaged in a
different way and this one is a very
vixen like bright red a very festive red
color but also a little bit Coralie it
so really nice for summer holidays as
well this is definitely like a toe color
for me I love to wear bright reds on my
toes I think it's just a really
glamorous classic shade to wear as
that's a nice one to add into my
collection and I'm going to open at
number 24 as well I feel like this might
be a full-size one yes I think I'm right
Wow oh my god that is so me this is a
full size Ciotti London paint pot in the
shade meet me at midnight absolutely
love this it's like a pinky gold with a
rose gold lid really nice treat on
Christmas Eve to get a full sized one I
think if you know anybody that is
obsessed with nails this is just such a
nice way to give them loads of new
colors to answer your collection and I
probably would never have gone out and
bought this shade because I'm not really
a glitter person but now that I've got
this full-sized one is definitely going
to spur me on it to do something a
little bit more unusual with my nails
this is Christmas time so beautiful
selection of nail varnish is from ciate
I'm sorry if you can hear squeaking by
the way Charlie is upstairs sorting out
its wardrobe and we have really really
quickie floorboards so apologies you can
hear that in the background next I'm
going to show you guys the a source of
beauty advent calendar this one is
probably the most chic packaging of them
all although I do find they look
fantastic one very chic do but this
one's like black and white and want to
cry you might want to cry with a
monochrome with a kind of marbling
effect down at the bottom so they've
definitely made this Instagram bowl very
wise a sauce and having looked down at
the side here it looks like there's some
really really good brands in here got
nooks Lottie London balance mean--if and
fab so I'm really excited to open up a
few days from a sauce inside is black
marble I was not expecting that not very
festive I have to say but beautiful
nonetheless I am going to open up number
two and let's see a very thick cardboard
race at sign Wow very good size products
from what I can see - can't get out okay
there we go so this is a batiste stylist
boom for my locs
XXL plumping powder once again this is
probably not something that I would have
picked up from the shops just because
I'm such a fan of my normal batiste dry
shampoo it's a really good way to give
something a little bit different a try
and who knows they discover a new
favorite that's what I love about these
calendars and then I'm going to go for
day number 9 I've not heard of this on
before this is glam that can dehydrate
your face and moisturizer cute little
size this one is 15 mil but I think
that's probably enough like almost a
month's used and once again this is a
friend that I've not heard of or tried
before so a good excuse to try something
new
from the asus advent calendar I'm also
going to open up day number 18 this is a
ginormous one ah and we have another
mini packet of face wipes this is from
yes - and yes - is on my favorite brands
these ones are 95 percent natural which
I absolutely love they're really gentle
on my skin and I've not actually tried
the cucumber face types before but I
feel like they'll be really nice and
refreshing potentially a new favorite I
think these will be really nice -
keeping a Hamburg just in case for any
midday emergencies and they do remove
makeup as well so really handy size and
very exciting thing to open up from your
advent calendar and I'm going to open up
one more I'm gonna open up day number 5
in here we have something I've not heard
of before
I'm dem Logica of course I've heard of
Dermalogica this is their clear start
breakout clearing foaming wash not
product I've tried and not a range I've
heard of before actually I've heard of
Dermalogica but not this range and but I
do love foaming face wash its are so
good for using with your cleansing
brushes so a really nice size for me to
give this one a try so there you have a
sneak peek into the ASOS beauty event
calendar I'm sure there are so so many
more amazing things inside in fact you
can have a look on the back so you've
got nude by Nature finishing powder
model Co lip liner Animus flash bomb
loads and loads of really amazing things
in here so definitely want to treat any
beauty lovers that you may know of or if
you're a beauty lower yourself a really
good one to treat yourself to lots of
really really nice brands in their
philosophy murine Egyptian magic Burt's
Bees cow shared so many amazing brands
in there
is so annoying just as I went to pick up
the molten brown one when the doors fell
open and half of things are fallen out
so I'm just going to show you the half
full advent calendar because I do not
have the energy to pick up and try and
reposition every single one but um so
there are loose boxes as I've just found
out and the
that is really really heavy so I feel
like there's going to be a lot of nice
treats from Alton Brown I'm going to
start by opening up day number 80 and
all of these boxes are just so well made
it's just really beautiful textured card
and with a little 3d ribbon on it so so
luxurious as you'd expect from Alton
Brown and let's see what we've got
oh that is so exciting it is a little
milk mini molten Brown a candle I think
for the look so this is a pink
peppercorn yes pink peppercorn
absolutely love this how cute is this
little dinky one really nice for
traveling some people I feel like I
should have a pound they retire my
setting it's good for traveling with
these advent calendar videos but
honestly it's so so good to get these
mini sizes because they're so handy to
take with you no matter where you're off
to personally I really like to take a
candle when I go traveling because it
just helps me relax and reminds me of
home so this is definitely one for me to
put in my suitcase for my next travels
but also if you just want to add a touch
of luxury to your home and you love
Morton Brown but maybe can't decide if
you like a scent enough to get the
full-size version this is a really
lovely way to try it out
and it is the proper Morton Brown glass
and what you call it holder so yeah
they've not skimped on their minis which
I absolutely love and the color so nice
then I'm going to open up number seven
equally a beautiful package this one
also feels sufficiently this one also
feels very satisfying your heavy and
we've got Oh delicious
rhubarb and rose shower and bath gel
this is one of my favorite scents as
well in fact I think I just love all
mods and brown stands and there was
nothing oh my gosh that's so good there
is nothing more luxurious and just
foaming yourself up with molten Brown
shower gel it's honestly when it's
life's little luxuries so that's a
really lovely treat and you know what if
there are some that you are feeling
taking generous with once you've opened
it you could always pop this into
someone's stocking I'm sure these would
make amazing stocking fillers but to be
honest you probably want to keep more
for yourself because else so nice and
then finally I'm going to
up number three there are 24 in this
calendar so very very generous tons of
gear fool I thought this is going to be
another candle but it's actually the
yellow mule and comforting body polisher
and I've actually just finished my pink
peppercorn body polisher so this has
come at a perfect time I love the body
Brown approaches because they're not too
grainy they will feel really
moisturizing and luxurious on the skin
but then they still get the job done
with exfoliation as well so the one that
I just finished was like a cream with
the exfoliating particles within it
whereas this one is more of a clear gel
with lots more of the exfoliating salts
inside so I think this one ooh I can
feel it in my fingers very very grainy
so good if you just want to give
yourself a really really good scrub and
really exfoliate away or your dead skin
cells and have a lovely pamper with that
heavenly molten Brown fragrance and on
the back it does give you a few ideas of
what else you can expect so whereas I
thought this would probably just be all
body gels and candles you've actually
got body polishes body lotions body wash
make handles to so many different things
and even a fine liquid hand wash so you
really do get to try out a lot of
different things from the molten Brown
range by getting this candle such a
lovely gift I think this is probably one
of my top get sayings on my favorites
there are so many good ones out there
this year you guys have to let me know
which one's your favorites are because I
knew that I just cannot decide and then
finally we have the sanctuary spa let go
days of Christmas and I just had a
little read on the back and basically
sanctuaries far want you to just relax
and let it all go let all your stresses
go and how a little bit of me time this
Christmas which is a really really nice
idea breathe relax and hashtag let go
that's such a nice way to encourage
people to relax and pamper over this
Christmas period so I'm guessing there's
going to be a lot of really chilled out
pampering bits and bobs in here so let's
have a little look inside ok so inside
let me Oh
and show you you have loads and loads of
different doors this one has 24 I think
24 can't see Christmas Day anywhere so
many different gifts and loads and loads
of really good sizes I love this orange
and pink design as well so beautiful and
yet festive as well with the gold dots
so let's have a look inside number 23
love this is on my favorite all-time
starry sky products this is the gentle
polish body scrub this smells so
insanely good I cannot even describe it
you can get this in Boots so just pop by
and give it a smell ah so good it makes
my mouth water so that's a really really
nice one to receive from the calendar
really good size as well it's not a full
size one but it is better than most
minis that you get and as with most
secretaries 4 X is the natural scrub so
there's no microbeads or anything that's
harming to the environment in that so
that's a really nice one and then it
let's open up number sixteenths it's so
so huge that's this one in this corner
here boom one of my favorite things this
is a body who actually emits normally
these coming like with fingers so more
of a glove but this is an exfoliating
body mitt so perfect if you want to give
yourself a bit of an exfoliation but not
as far as using a scrub personally I use
and exfoliating mitt every time I shower
because it just helps to keep the skin
cells regenerating without being as
harsh as a scrub so yeah absolutely love
these so so handy and it'll be nice to
use a mitt as opposed to a glove that's
not something I've actually tried before
normally I've got fingers on my gloves
and finally the last one I'm going to be
opening until vlogmas i'm going to open
up a number 17 17 being one of my lucky
numbers so let's see we have something
i've not tried this is the cleanse
radiance exfoliator complexion
refreshing scrub so this is a face
exfoliator a really nice size you're
going to kill move saying it again but
once again great for traveling you don't
want to have your paws clogged when
you're traveling and I don't know about
you but I might take a cleanser with me
traveling but I very rarely will take an
exfoliator so this is a really good one
to pack into your travel bags I know
I know you're going to be so fed of me
saying that but I'm sure this is going
to be a really lovely fragrance product
I'm using my other hat and hold of the
calendar otherwise I would unscrew it
and give it a smell but judging on how
the rest of the range smells I'm sure
this is absolutely heavenly so the other
things that we can expect in here
include the detox Mars a heart shaped
cookie cutter that's a really nice idea
radiant exfoliator intensive heal bond
and even a micellar water so loads of
really really practical and usable
pieces inside the sanctuary calendar so
that's it guys they are all the beauty
