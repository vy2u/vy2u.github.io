vlogmas Charlie and I are heading to the
gym on Saturday morning it's actually
our first time going to this gym it's
the new virgin active in cotton old town
and they've just spent how I'd really
like nearly 2 million I think yeah so we
used to go to Soho gym as you guys
probably know if you've watched previous
vlogs but we're looking forward to going
to the trial version and we're gonna do
some ab workouts I'm gonna do some
running ain't we gonna do what we can do
in here we did our joint ab workout get
rid of some of that cheese fondue and my
cheese a place that's like yeah ok and
then and then we'll do some Hillsboro
Springs ok
damn kids I think today's vlog is gonna
be quite a long one for you guys because
you've got a busy day it's our first day
back obviously from Switzerland and
we've got a load of stuff to do in the
house there's gonna be a lot of tidying
going on we need to take up warm up lock
them out in the past week and we are
hoping to also get our Christmas tree
today so fingers crossed to be able to
find one Charlie's gonna watch the rugby
and I'm just going to do some clock
photography while he does that and then
we've got dinner tonight so it should be
quite fun and busy day it's actually
such a beautiful day bright blue skies
sunny
work out them
that was a good but short workout
session we just did a few ABS workouts
on the Roman chair and then I did 20
minutes running just like fast slow fast
slow hits I guess you'd call it so that
was really good
the Germans actually really beautiful so
I told you I think you had like a two
million pound or publish meant not sure
with that so I have the exact price and
but yeah the changing rooms the female
changing rooms re beautiful but these
big mirrors has straighteners blow
dryers and all these little products
that you can use on the gym itself is
actually fairly small and it's got
everything you need in there so it's
going to be good to get fit before
Christmas time before the New Year rush
and also it's in platform old tower and
Charlie and I both said it's so nice to
actually have a reason to walk through
having old town because we don't
normally go there but there's so many
nice like bakeries and little cafes and
shops so we walked up back via Gail's we
got just some bread to have with us soup
for lunch typical winter lunch just some
really hearty warming soup and I got a
seeded sourdough and we also got a
strawberry protein shake from the gym
there's a little cafe and you can get
loads of like healthy meals or healthy
snacks or juices or protein shakes and
things like that
hang them again now um we're gonna have
a quick turn around I've got a few
things to package up some vlogmas
giveaway things to send off and I'm
gonna go down to dawdle we're probably
gonna have to get a taxi to bring us
back because it's gonna be far too much
for us to carry I know there's my reefa
that I made at the Pandora event as well
as two big bags and then I just couldn't
carry home after the event plus like a
week's worth of blogger mail for me and
Charlie so it's gonna be tough but we'll
get it all back
two different views on coffee is cold
it's like oh my goodness you guys did
you see the amount of packages that we
just unloaded we had to get an uber from
dawdle to drop us off home charlie is
very stressed because he also has a very
long to-do list today and we were over
an hour and a half in dawdle it's half
past two now we left home at about half
past twelve so yeah our productive day
has just pretty much been slashed in
half because we had so many parcels and
daughter was so around that everyone was
picking out those Black Friday offers
also someone came up to me being like
are you Freddie not like no I'm not
Freddie to that are you sure it's really
really strange I don't know if she maybe
follows both me and Freddie my love and
thought I was Freddie I don't know if I
get my comparison quite a lot but no it
wasn't me it was just a very strange
very strange interaction so yeah I'm
gonna put on some soup now Charlie's
managed to get the rugby going on his
laptop because our sky is broken and
after the soup I'm gonna have some
coffee and do a massive massive block of
melon boxing it's gonna take a while and
not gonna show you everything because
that could become the world's longest
video and I know some people don't like
blogger mail and boxing but I will show
you the highlights start so sure so I'm
gonna get cooking now because I am
starving
it's a couple of hours now since I last
spoke to you guys and since then I have
had a shower I've had my lunch and I've
been editing the vlog amounts that you
will have seen yesterday so a little bit
last minute but I was just finishing off
the edits for that doing the description
box doing the thumbnail all these kind
of things which do take up a little bit
of time so as you can see from this bomb
site I put all my bloggers mail upstairs
as I said earlier I know not everybody
likes to watch blog mail and boxing so
if you don't like to watch it then I
suggest you skip the next couple of
minutes or so of this video because I am
going to do a little bit of an boxing
showing you some bits and bobs that
brands have kindly sent over some bits
that might be coming up on the blog soon
and also there's some stuff that I've
just bought here as well so I can see an
anthropology Hall and also some bits and
bobs from mr. Porter which are for jolly
Christmas so yeah there's quite a lot of
stuff to unbox I am gonna stick a
vlogmas on I think I'm watching at the
moment I'm watching Naomi's smart and
then I think I'm gonna watch Sami Maria
because I haven't watched their vlogmas
yet so got my laptop in place I've got
my coffee to keep me going so let's do
this
my reef which is the one that I made
when I went to the Pandora a couple of
days at we've done so I'm just gonna go
and hang on the door even though it's
actually dark outside I thought I just
hang it up because that's why it's gonna
go don't know how to do it
okay it's about an hour later I have
done so much unboxing and tidying and
the room is still kind of a bit of a
mess but this is what happens on La
Gomera unboxing days so I've been
watching a few other people's vlogger
misses and it seems so much easier for
them when their parcels just arrived
like one or two a day and they just
unbox them and deal with it whereas I go
down to dawdle like once a week and then
it's just a whole ordeal but yes I've
done quite a lot of unboxing I've got a
few exciting things to show you
something which I was really blown away
by I'm really impressed by is the Revlon
Ultra ad matte ad/hd matte lip color and
I've got it on now and I definitely call
this a your lips but better it feels
really soft but I put it on when I
started doing the unboxing and it's
still looking and feeling really good
and Revlon they also sent me some donors
I think they were but sadly they got
completely crushed up in the mayhem that
is the back area of Dajjal and they also
sent over some information about the VNA
and also some tickets undressed a brief
history of underwear sponsored by a
drone Procter and Revlon so got a couple
of tickets to that and that is to use by
the 12th of March next year so yeah
that's the really lovely thing that
Revlon are doing so thank you Revlon
guys they sent a few other bits of
makeup over that I haven't tried yet but
yeah this lipstick I'm very impressed
with so far lanique also have been
spoiling Charlie and I they sent over a
his-and-hers I have new and unwrapped it
yeah but I can see what's inside his and
hers
Clinique sonic system and this one I
actually tried in Selfridges in the face
gym they used it on me and it was so so
good so I'm really looking forward to
using this they can I pop it in the
shower because I feel like I just fell
out as a habit of using sonic facial
brushes but I need to get back into the
habit especially now that it's so cold
outside my skin definitely needs a good
buffing and they all
so sent over one for Charlie which is
really really nice the black manly one I
think that's also a really good
Christmas gift if your boyfriend or dad
or brother likes the skincare but
wouldn't really treat himself to
something like that Charlie is obsessed
with using these boozy facial brushes so
yeah I think that'd be a really good
gift I also got a chocolate advent
calendar from Elizabeth Arden if you
watched my advent calendar unboxing
videos you may know that I did alright
actually already receive one of these so
I'm gonna pop that to sign and give it
to my mom when she comes over tomorrow
she'll be very grateful but that's
Elizabeth Arden and lint
I think calendar which is just amazing I
received a load of false eyelashes from
earlier which is my favorite false lash
brand this is their luxe collection
these ones are kind of three-quarter
lashes which are my favorite style
because you don't really feel that
they're there and China I going out for
dinner tonight so I might wear those
later on and also got the December
glossy box so I'm gonna have a little
rummage through here and show you guys
what's inside box itself is really
pretty with this kind of golden wreath
detail and then it's gold on the edges
too quite hard to open with just one
hand there we go so we've got some
information on the top here a gift to
make you blush ooh la la
okay so that is a difficulty box website
and then inside let's see what delights
we have beauty news we've got some
information there and then oh my gosh
how old-school I feel like this used to
be advertised all the time like a few
years ago but I haven't really seen it
recently so it's that lipstick sealing
liquid lip coat I'm definitely gonna be
trying that out I never tried it before
but I've tried obviously similar
products that claims do the same thing
so looking forward giving that a try
this is an essence makeup light of your
face lou manizer palette I don't think
I've tried anything from that brand
before this is a good opportunity to
give that a try
MDM
this kind of looks like a golden tampon
hi
and that is in fact a beautiful berry
lipstick looks like a really matte shade
as well as a very matte consistency in
the bullet there and a gorgeous autumnal
and wintery color also from Revlon that
there is a berry shade nail varnish
that's a really beautiful shade not too
dissimilar to what I've gone on now I've
got a couple of layers of the berry em
on my nails right now need to redo them
though so probably gonna do that next
and this is one of those shaky powdery
eyebrow what would you call it liners
from collection I actually got a preview
of these almost like a year ago I feel
like it was quite a long time ago but
they're really really cool especially if
you just like a little bit more of a
natural look on your brows so really
fabulosity box for december alrighty so
it's probably about an hour or so since
I last spoke to you guys and it's been a
very productive hour I have done so much
tidying this room is looking fairly
clear as far as this room goes it's kind
of the blogging dumping ground but I'm
determined to clear it all out and we're
so nearly there I don't know about you
but whenever I have a task that I need
to do or whenever I have a really long
to-do list
I am the queen of procrastination I like
to be productive so even my
procrastination is always doing
something kind of productive like I
wouldn't go on Facebook or YouTube for
and waste an hour that way but instead
of doing what I need to do I decided to
organize my wardrobe get rid of my non
copper hangers and put my autumn clothes
in the loft so yeah that took up a bit
of time and I really did not need to do
that today
a couple of other things that I wanted
to show you before I finish finish my
blog a mail haul can you help me hold
this open chart show them yeah oh you
hold the camera here right okay well
basically this and you get Charlie to
help me hold her in a second is a prince
which was kindly sent to me by Hannah
Mitchell vac and it says what it sounds
yeah Vic just cuz it's easy
create so
and you are creating these fabulous
prints and it's like a really lovely
material really lovely like too thick
for a paper and gold embossing so yeah
we're going to get it framed show them
and put it up on the wall next our next
Dexter so pride of place oh thank you so
much Hannah if you're watching for
sending that over very very kind of you
and it's gonna have pride of place in my
office and what else
oh okay so Charlie and I are really fun
if we're actually working with mr.
Porter to create some editorial content
for them and sadly this stuff is just on
loan I remember I told you guys during
October that a lot of the time when
bloggers have like a new designer bag
every two weeks
it is loaned to them not something that
they've bought themselves a lot of the
time it is something they bought
themselves but some things are loaned so
mr. Porter is obviously the boy version
of NASA Porter and I got to choose some
net-a-porter pieces to borrow for our
shoot so let me show you the bag that I
have chosen it's not packaged how it
normally would so I guess it's kind of a
sample but let me just undo it and show
you guys here she is so this is actually
a Gucci bag that I've had my eye on for
quite some time I'm not sure the
official name it could be part of the
maman family and I'm not too sure I will
leave it on the screen here so you can
see which one it is and I'll leave it
linked down below so I chose this one
for the shoot that I'm doing with
Charlie although I feel like I'm gonna
road test it and if I love it to pieces
then I may make a cheeky purchase so let
me know what you guys think of this one
I think it's around the 700-pound mark
so not so expensive as my dionysus bag
but still very pricy for a small bag so
it needs to be the kind of thing that I
would get a lot of use out of so I'm
going to give this a road test tonight -
actually it's quite wide there darling
look I could fit my camera in there
could fit my phone well we will see you
later on tonight also for the shoot I
chose this pair of boots from Sofia
Webster they were actually a few other
shoes which are my first and second
choice but so many things were running
low on stock so these are my actually my
third choice love the color of this dust
bag so let me show you these
oh my gosh so here is number one I
actually do feel like I'd get a lot of
use out of something like this Sophia
Webster obviously has that butterfly
design which is so beautiful and runs
across both shoes I mean they actually
do look fairly spectacular don't they so
cute
can't wait to give those a try I will
show you those later on I mean I wish I
had the kind of money to just spend
frivolously on net-a-porter whenever I
wanted to but sadly yeah those pieces
are gonna have to go back but I will
just indulge in my designer dreams and
pretend they're part in a while I'm
borrowing them I need to do my makeup
and hair now and get changed because
Charlie and I are going to a restaurant
called aquavit tonight with a champagne
brand that Charlie has worked with
previously so it's gonna be a nice kind
of a date night but there's gonna be a
few of our blogger powers there as well
so I'm gonna quickly sort this out and I
will see you guys in a few moments
before I do my makeup I wanted to show
you guys today's giveaway prizes and
it's this fabulous collection of makeup
from collection so you have these two
wonderful eyeshadow palettes these are
really good for creating smokey eyes
they're so affordable as well I
absolutely love these shadow palettes
nice if you want to try out some
different shades that you're not used to
wearing but really beautiful shade
selection in those two then there's some
of their nail varnishes which lasts so
long this is like a gel topcoat sand
makes them really shiny I adore this
color I'm actually gonna paint my nails
I think in that a little bit later then
you have these three sparkly eyeliners
these are so glittery perfect for the
festive season they really do Sparkle
and catch the light so beautifully these
are the velvet kiss lipsticks you're
going to get three shades of the ears
whoever is the winner this one is my
favorite I think the name of this one I
can't remember
kara melt who is the name of this one
absolutely love them and again so
affordable but the winner of the
giveaway will get those three another
beautiful color nail varnish and then
these every blogger just raves about
these they are they're primed and ready
I think you could kind of use them as a
primer but I also like to use them as a
highlight this one is just such a
beautiful glowing shade so you're going
to get two of those this one is for the
face and this one is for the under-eye
okay I really I'm gonna get ready now
Charlie is getting angry at me shouting
at me Jess you've got to leave in ten
minutes so let's see if I can get ready
in ten minutes
crazy lighting in here but I just had to
show you this insane bathroom aquavit
never help you it's gold and a sign of a
very amazing bathroom ESOP Hanser love
it so much I'm here with Katie but she's
just you guys no Katie I'm gonna give
you an out there the date because this
mirror is very much like not gonna lie
so top is from whistles it's kind of
cash Mary I got it in a sale last year
and just love it it's my Pandora
necklace which has seen a million times
before watch is by Seiko I've been
wearing this loads recently love it
culottes are from wreaths and we'll
these at Fashion Week and then my shoes
are my new zombies Eliza zombie so Janet
oh my god I don't know how to say it
Jean V so rusty that's the one with the
rose gold points two caps and then the
suede backs
although I have to be honest I didn't
wear these to travel here because I do
not want to ruin that suede and then
I've got the new Gucci bag which I
showed you guys earlier which I am
learning more in love with by the second
back home again it is almost midnight
past my bedtime had such a lovely
evening at aquavit with Charles
Heidsieck champagne
I was Charlie's plus-one tonight the
tables are turning but it was really
good fun and the champagne is actually
really nice I don't normally like that
many alcoholic drinks but it was
genuinely a very lovely evening and food
that was really nice as well it's quite
a Nordic inspired restaurant Charlie
actually did a blog review of a meal
that he had there so I'll leave that
links down below but it's such a lovely
place if you're a blogger great place
for breakfast as well cause it's so
bright and that even tonight it was just
really really beautiful inside yeah it's
like marble you guys saw the gold
classroom um I actually fell asleep in
the taxi on the way home I was going to
do a face mask because I have a couple
of pesky blemishes on my chin but I feel
like I would probably fall asleep with a
face mask like I did that are you gonna
do one yeah I'm gonna probably do you
well I can't even see on its gonna take
my makeup off and go to bed have I done
the giveaway today uh yeah I think I
have a shoe update Jean Vito Rossi's I
did find them very comfortable although
weirdly after I've been sitting down for
a bit and my feet unweld
they were actually too big and my feel
kind of like sliding out of them which
was a bit strange
so my Valentino's are still number one
in the comfy shoe award for mates but
yeah but because they don't have any
straps my feet were like falling out of
them so I was having to do like a weird
shuffle yeah
whereas the balance loads obviously
because they've got the straps on them
I'll still the better for watching
missing Gavin and Stacey and I always
watch governance Stacey this time of
year it's kind of become our tradition
also really impressed with the Revlon
ultra matte HD lip thing that I've shown
you earlier because it's still going
strong on my lips and I applied it like
six hours ago they're very impressed
on that note would you guys like to see
a drugstore festive get ready with me
because that's something I'm in thinking
about doing
any other festive video ideas let me
know because I'm gonna do a little bit
filming over the next few days yes
anything involving better we're getting
a little boy back tomorrow it so excited
haven't seen you in so long
anyway I'm gonna go to bed now and so I
hope you enjoyed today's vlog tomorrow
hopefully we'll be more festive because
mom's coming over and we're going to put
the tree up maybe we're gonna put the
decorations up at least so yeah I'll see
you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
