Gothenburg so Charlie and I are off
exploring West Sweden Gothenburg this
morning and we've left the hotel and are
now on a mission to find a nice brunch
where are we heading going it's called
the cafe
hurry called La Petite cafe and
apparently it's a really lovely place to
breakfast a few people commented on some
Instagram photos yesterday recommending
it and also the lady that showed us
around yesterday recommended it so
that's our first port of call this
morning
if you suffer merry little Christmas let
your heart be light from now on man
Jeffers will be our lives so we just had
a lovely breakfast at la petit cafe and
we could have had breakfast at the hotel
but Tony is gonna be writing a guide to
Gothenburg on his blog so we always try
and find some nice unusual breakfast
places and they were just gonna have a
little wonder around now there's some
really nice shots around here and we had
a little walk around yesterday very much
Charlie's style there's like nudie jeans
is actually is it from here nudie Keens
uh were a bit where were made in
Gothenburg yeah
and loads of really nice shoes and home
wares why do you do that yeah it's very
very cold it's got like a lot of snow on
break that cook my thermals need to get
you some first I'm sorry darling yes I
will convert him so yeah lots of really
nice home wares shoes and accessories so
let's go and do a little bit of shopping
marry
so does anybody else remember the
Moomins or is it me just showing my age
but mom always used to say that I look
like little my which is this character I
had my hair in a bun Matt is Dexter no
that's a moment so I didn't explain
earlier but where we had breakfast is in
an area called Hager H a G a and
apparently it's kind of like a hipster
area the cooler area may be a little bit
shorter G yeah and there's people
selling things on the streets there's
ladies selling handbags over on the
fence behind me a little bit Cambridge
Satchel Company ask lots of vintage
stores around here so it's nice to
discover different kind of town
we get in darling what is it unlike a
monk for a mug would you want to get
your pain
so we've embarked on a leadership road
trip we've just picked up a car that
were renting for the day and we're now
driving into a place that I've not even
a circles Runkle I don't know it's
impossible to pronounce even the Swedish
people can pronounce it but it's an
hour's drive Charlie's doing very well
considering we're driving on the wrong
side of the road we using my Google Maps
a saucer now and I think we're gonna be
there in just under an hour the scenery
is pretty beautiful everything is just
covered in like a line their processors
not snowy very nice all white and
beautiful and we just drive it and sing
Christmas carols
Christmas I gave you my heart but the
very next day you gave it
to save me from tears I'll give it to
sorry
you gave
we have finally arrived and we've just
got to the place that we're staying
tonight it's like a massive almost like
a sea container but more permanent and I
think that's about eight rooms in this
whole building and we're the only ones
staying here tonight so you've pretty
much got the place to ourselves but as
you can see behind me our room is very
very cool so it's called hotel slip and
it's brand new and it's on the island
first get this I really cannot pronounce
the island but I'll leave it written
down here and it's basically just like a
fisherman's island it's ten kilometers
long and five kilometers wide so very
very small but this room is absolutely
but this room is very very cool have a
look at this
it's uh
good morning so I just realized I did
not finish the vlog off properly
yesterday we ate far too much so we had
dinner at the restaurant which is
connected to the hotel here which is the
slip and hotel and it was like a
Christmas buffet which apparently is a
bit of a Swedish tradition especially in
these areas and I think that Charlie and
I definitely felt quite privileged to be
there we were definitely the only
tourists amongst loads of the locals
they were even asking us like how did
you find out about this place so it was
pretty cool to be there so the first
course was different types of herring
which had been cooked in in different
ways I didn't actually have any some not
the biggest lover of fish and then the
second course was more fish
Charlie had lobster bisque and then
there was like monkfish balls and like a
cheese sauce which actually looked
amazing but again I didn't have any
because it was fish and then there was
it was really cool you almost like went
into the kitchens so the chef's had
pre-prepared it in the day in the day
before so you went into the kitchen oops
my camera battery just died mid-sentence
but I think I was just telling you about
our main course which was basically the
lighting is so weird by the way because
it's like bright blue gray outside it's
so unusual this weather here it's a half
past nine and it's only just started to
get light and yes I'm still in my
pajamas I don't know what is going on
this place just makes me super sleepy
but yes we had the main course which was
again loads of literally like they've
just got the pants off the stove and put
them on the side for you to help
yourself we had this incredible like
slow-cooked pork which was my absolute
favorite creamed spinach
there were loads of different like cold
meats and then the desserts oh my god so
many different desserts
I had like two creme brulees they were
loads of little Panna cottas loads of
cakes cheese coffee and it was all just
help yourself and then there was mulled
wine and so yeah it was a fabulous
fabulous dinner and apparently people
come from all over Sweden to have this
Christmas buffet dinner here so I'll
leave information about it down below
because I'm sure if any of you guys
visit Sweden then you
very very interested to try it um I
would definitely be coming back here if
and when I come back to Sweden because
it was fab yes and we just started to
get light so we can see where we are for
the first time because it was dark when
we arrived here yesterday and as I don't
know if you can see behind me we are in
like a fishing port don't know if that's
gonna focus yeah so we're gonna go and
have some breakfast and then it go for a
little explore so we've gone for a
little winter's walk after having
breakfast at the hotel and what is this
talent is this trickle trickle ah yeah
that place we can't pronounce um but
it's a very cute town but we feel like
we're the only human beings here it's
quite strange no don't yeah if there's
like a bit of a movie set yeah you can
like all the houses are so perfect with
their perfect weeds and the perfect
fairy lights but we have not crossed a
single human being another human oh the
same human so it is a fishing port so
we're wondering if people maybe just
come here during the summer months and
do their fishing and then in the winter
they just hibernate back in the city but
it is it's really beautiful it's just
listen
we're back from our little walk and
we're just packing all our bits and bobs
up and we're going to have a little
explore the other rooms here because
this place is pretty cool and we're
intrigued to see what the other places
the other rooms look like so you
couldn't really see us yesterday but
we've got this lovely lounge area with
these seats and sofa TV on the wall who
needs TV when you've got this beautiful
view you can see it a little bit better
now the harbor behind us so we're going
to go and check out a few of the other
rooms because as I mentioned yesterday
we're the only ones staying here tonight
so let's go and explore
so this is room Regina which is pretty
much the mirror image of our room it's
opposite us and each of the rooms has
been named after someone that used to
live on the island or that still does
live on the island so this is named
after Regina and you've got a picture of
her up on the wall here it's like little
wooden Oh
lady's head so she looks like she was a
rudder I think she might be a model
she's cute it's probably like a
fisherman's life or something I bet
she's a good cook though yep so another
beautiful room there's lots of very
Instagram pool surfaces here Charlie
have you seen the table very they all
have really cool head boards as well I'm
also realizing the on this trip I didn't
pack particularly well all I've been
wearing this whole time is jumpers my
scarf my thermal jeans back home again
now after what feels like a terribly
long journey because of all the tube
strikes and train strikes there's a
little bit of a mission to get home and
it's about half past nine now China
absolutely starving
so we've just ordered an Indian from
across the road and I'm so excited to
get into bed take my makeup off and have
a curry we're gonna watch Gavin and
Stacey and enjoy a chicken korma and she
can take in a cellar because that is how
boring we are BSR I didn't vlog this
afternoon but basically we drove from
fish kibosh fur still can't say it back
to Gothenburg and we had lunch in
Gothenburg in a really random Swedish
cafe but it was nice to have some more
local food and yeah then we basically
flew home so you didn't miss too much
but I think I was just quite knackered
for some inexplicable reason because I
haven't really exerted myself too much
so I didn't really pick up the blood and
too much but normal vlogging will be
resuming over the next few days I have a
bit of a backlog because I didn't
actually edit or upload yesterday's
Swedish vlog yet so you'll have a few
days to catch up on so thank you guys
for watching I hope you enjoyed coming
on our Swedish adventure with us and I
will see you tomorrow for a normal
London vlog so see you soon and good
night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
