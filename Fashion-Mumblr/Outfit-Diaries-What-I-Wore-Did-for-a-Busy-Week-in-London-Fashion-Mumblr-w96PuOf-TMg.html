outfit diaries video it's starting off
as usual on a Sunday normally I like to
spend my Sunday's in my pajamas but
today we're going out for something
lunch at the Hawksmoor restaurant which
is one of China's favorite restaurants
so very much looking forward to that and
so naturally I'm not wearing my promise
to go to lunch so this is what I'm
wearing for lunch today I have got some
new over-the-knee boots which I'm very
very excited about these are from Karen
Millen you might recognize the style of
these because I actually had the exact
same pair but in the kind of coppery
ready brown shade and I wore them in my
autumn look but last year and I
basically lived in them throughout the
whole of last autumn winter so I'm
looking forward to wearing those again
but this year they brought them out in
gray and I just could not resist
I just love over-the-knee boots then I
am wearing my Marks and Spencer corduroy
skirt this one I've been wearing so much
and it was such a good price I think it
was like 45 pounds so I've been loving
wearing this and then as I styled my
pink corduroy skirt in that blog post
I've also styled this quarter I won with
miry scamper this is one of the most
versatile jumpers I've ever owned I wear
it so much it goes with so many things
and it's nice for layering because you
can just put things underneath it things
over the top and it's not too bulky but
you still get all the warmth and
coziness from a jumper and then my
favorite part of my outfit is my new
handbag so if you can see the color
there it's actually a really dark blue
navy shade which I do not have any Navy
handbags aside from this one so I feel
like this shade is a really nice neutral
but a neutral that's not black which is
great because I don't wear too much
black but it's a really lovely shade
that just kind of goes with so many
things in my wardrobe the brand is
called
aged ades and they're really unusual in
how they work basically they're
launching on Kickstarter and and there's
this amazing process where as customers
we get to kind of vote on the way the
bag is designed and how its styled and
made so very very exciting I will tell
you all about that a little bit later on
but now we are going to head out and get
some lunch at Hawksmoor so I'll see you
there
webinar I choose walking down the shore
dive in headfirst down to the ocean
floor
Jabar brown eyes preferred Firefly
slipping right legs getting me high
young wave
it's like to stay up late things we have
to do anyway we do
I mean I've had a delicious lunch oh-ho
s'more I think that's probably in my top
three lunches right yeah I need to do a
blog post on it but yeah I think the
Harvard on is slightly better Hawks was
amazing I don't really know where else
that's why I want to do and then because
we are already dressed up we decided to
come to our favorite place in pictures
which is how mouths if you are not from
around here then caramel is a great
place to come not for taking photos this
is beautiful light there's local
tourists like on the main road kind of
there but this bit for the columns I
think it's just absolute beautiful the
lighting is gorgeous and then all the
way down that way down at the very end
is Buckingham Palace so as you're
visiting it's a great place to come and
then this side of Pall Mall is Trafalgar
Square
so generally we're gonna head back home
now put these fancy clothes on and we're
going to clear out Charlie's wardrobe
I'm going to put loads of his stuff on
eBay well he's gonna ditch it and yes
layers of shoes
good morning it is Tuesday today we've
come out to Tunbridge Wells on a bit of
a day trip so outfit of the day is I'd
say a practical one but having walked
around for the past couple of hours in
these boots potentially not so much so
outfit of the day is a nice cozy jumper
got my M&amp;amp;S serving on underneath of
course and then some faux leather
trousers from Topshop and my Russell and
Romney boots I've done the typical
blogger things day of double hand
bagging it so on my body my crossbody
bag is my New River Island bag and then
with all my essentials inside wearing an
absolute ton right now is my address bag
which as you can see I figured out that
that is half an ounce it Adair's it's
not AIDS so previously mentioned so yeah
it's got all my bits and bobs for the
day in which today includes rather a lot
we have got my huge camera which have
been lugging around with me all day and
then I've also got drinks I have got my
laptop in there so really this is just
carrying all of my essentials for the
day luckily with a shoulder strap it's
quite too comfortable to wear so that's
been very very practical I will show you
my outfit of the day properly and then
it's time to head inside for a very
well-deserved public
good morning it is Wednesday morning it
feels much later in the week from that I
don't know why but this week is really
dragging maybe it's a little mixture of
the jetlag and just being a little bit
tired I am spending this morning working
from home so naturally I'm wearing my
cozy outfit I recently got this in the
post from revolve and it is the snuggly
jumper I think I own it's super super
soft and then it's got this ginormous
really snuggly almost scarf like neck
which I love and also peaking through
this arrived yesterday is my new Michael
Kors access watch I've never owned a
SmartWatch before so I'm really looking
forward to seeing how I get along with
that I'll keep you updated as you can
imagine and then I'm wearing my I think
these are super dry leggings and my EMU
slippers which I just absolutely love so
that's this morning's outfit of the day
but I am gonna be getting dressed
properly to go out a little bit later
it's gonna be quite a fun day so this
morning you're just working from home
I've done a few emails I have written or
started writing a few blog posts I am
working with dicenio-- on my blog doing
a nice little post about their posters
and frames so I've also been taking a
photo of our lovely new poster wall up
up up there which I'm really really
pleased with I will show you how it
looks from afar we've always had this
blank wall and never really known what
to do with it haven't wanted to spend a
load of money but these are very very
affordable it looks like this this is
what it looks like I took to the wall
with a hammer myself and it was actually
very very easy to put up I was inspired
by one of the they have like little
inspiration pages on their website where
it gives you ideas on how to put little
clusters and collages together like this
or you can just check Pinterest but I
think this looks really lovely and it
kind of goes with the color scheme of
the lounge we've got pinks whites and
then I really absolutely adore this
ballerina photo they have a couple of
lovely ballerina ones up there so yes
I'm very very pleased with that as I
said very affordable and they've also
given me a discount code so if you use
the word or type in fashion mumbler or
as one word in the checkout either today
or tomorrow so you want to be quite
snappy but they're flawed we'll all the
time but this just helps type fashion
mumbler into the promo box when you get
to checkout and you'll get 25% off
posters until the end of tomorrow does
however exclude hand-picked or
collaboration posters and frames but I
believe most of the ones that I have
gone for you can get a 25% off so that's
a nice little treat if you want to
brighten up your home I think it's a
good idea if you're renting as well and
you just want to add a little bit of
personality to your house or your living
room and obviously check with your
landlord first before you go banging
anything into the walls but yeah very
piece of it Charlie doesn't mind it to
which I'm relieved at because of course
it's lots of pink so I will leave a link
to them down below and also a link to my
blog posts or taking some really lovely
photos around the house just showing you
a few corners that you might not have
seen before and also some tips on how I
chose those and how to style them so
check that out so for the rest of the
morning I'm just gonna chill um right
here in front of the fire so cozy get a
few more blog posts done I've got lots
of photos to edit as well from my trip
to Tunbridge Wells and and then I'll
catch up with you a little bit later
heading into town via a Monica vanad
rose gold taxi which is going to be
pretty awesome and and then I'm getting
my hair colored which is wonderful
because my roots are starting to show
through so that is the plan of the day
and I will catch up with you a little
bit later on
don't touch me it's crazy
hi oh okay so we're currently on route
into central London and we have been
picked up in the beautiful moniker
vinegar rose gold taxi which is
beautiful and we're going to the store
as I mentioned earlier and I will show
you around there cuz it's a new comic
Garden boutique outfit the day wise I am
wearing my Reis top which he has been
worn so so much as one of those really
good investment pieces I have got
changed out my now home to a very
earlier
and then my beautiful Monaco skirts and
as you saw in that previous clip I also
have my smaller handbag with me and I
have got most of my things in this
because today I'm going to their dresses
I'm going to need my laptop to do some
work there I've got my camera off for
shooting pictures from Monika vinegar so
all of my essentials fit in my a DES bag
I did promise you yesterday or the day
before that is going to tell you a
little bit more about the bag so now
that I have bit of free time in the taxi
I will explain so this is not just any
old luxury handbag as consumers we can
decide so many aspects of the bag for
the design to the communication methods
on how they get the message out there
really is a totally new way of choosing
a luxury handbag this one is made of
beautiful calfskin leather it's actually
the same leather as the Hermes Kelly bag
I believe it's a very very high quality
and it's the ana bag which is one of
their most iconic designs so you can
basically decide from lots of different
leather types different colors different
design details and they are as I
mentioned launching on Kickstarter so if
you want to help make the project live
then you can check out their Kickstarter
page I'll leave that link down in the
description box below and help make the
project life very very exciting really
cool new way of doing things
I think this would be a really beautiful
Christmas gift ideas so I will leave a
link to this one down in description box
as well check it out so currently on
route 2 shortage house after my
appointment at Daniel Galvan for my
highlights
they used the the new range I think it's
called love your highlights which is
created by Daniel garland himself so
it's really nice to try that out it's
all about nourishing at the hair which
of course colored hair desperately needs
I will of course to show you what this
looks like properly in better lighting
later on because at the moment I'm being
illuminated by someone's brake lights
lots of traffic in town at the moment
but it's great to have my roots sorted
and then they put a really lovely shade
of toner on afterwards which is given it
this kind of slightly world terminal
shade which I'm really really loving a
beautiful salon as well and they have
it's always a small things they have a
cafe in there which does very healthy
juices and things like that so a very
nice experience now on the way to
shortage house where I'm actually on a
panel tonight with a few brands and some
people that work in influencer marketing
and I'm there to I guess be the devil's
advocate and talk about in floor
from my side of things so she'll be
really interesting and not sure if
they'll and not sure if I'll be able to
film much but good morning today is
