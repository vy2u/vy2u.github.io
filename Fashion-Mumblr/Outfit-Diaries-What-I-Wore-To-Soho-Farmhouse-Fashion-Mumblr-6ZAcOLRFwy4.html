today is Monday and Charlie nice stayed
last night at the beautiful Clifton
house which hopefully you can see in the
background there I've done a whole vlog
of our time here so that'll probably be
going live it might have gone live
yesterday actually so keep an eye out
for that if you want to see how amazing
it is here and it's just one of the most
stunning buildings I think I've ever
seen so this week we've got quite a few
fun things planned which I'm excited to
bring you along too aside from this
we're also going it to so her farm house
this week and this outfit diary video is
only going to be five days because we're
flying to Boston on Friday so I think I
will do a whole new vlog for that so
today's outfit is lots of nice textures
we've got some cashmere some suede it's
definitely awkward to jump over and some
suede very autumnal look today
walking it through the gym Charlie
somehow going to be a good idea to do
the PT session at 5:30 in the evening
I'm such a morning workout person so
yeah we normally work out like 8 a.m.
anyways and hangs virgin we have a
lovely PT added I'm going to do a
session with us I think it's going to be
full body today circuits yeah that's
what we normally do I'm going to show a
little bit more detail of our workout
today because I've got my camera with me
instead of just phone clips and when
Charlie and I share our workouts on
Instagram stories we get a lot of
questions so I thought I would show you
today's workout in a little bit more
wish us luck
the end of every session
Charlie tries to beat his record on the
assault bike how quickly he can do 10
calories yes what's your record cherry
star okay ready go get that
you betta yeah
18.5 but the next closest just 14.5
hello so it is Tuesday and morning I
spent working from home all day and
finally now in town for a couple of
meetings I'm heading firstly to the
Mondrian Hotel and there's a little bit
of a panther session going on with
Swarovski so to accessorize my outfit
today unsurprisingly I've got my
favourites obviously bracelets on these
are part of the remix collection so you
can kind of mix and match your
favourites they have little magnetized
clasps on them so they just clip
together which is really clever fun way
of just making them very mix-and-match
of all so heading now I think I'm going
to get to me facial which I'm very much
looking forward to and then there's
nothing around town for a few more
meetings so I will leave you with my
outfit of the day
why do i why do I get so upset when a
father
do I
every time with you Express what is on
your mind
Thanks
in
all the
good morning it is Wednesday and Charlie
and I are driving to my mama's house we
are about to drop drop drop the hands
off we got Dexter and Dicky the palmdale
my king where's Dickie Dickie lying a
lot I see dropping the hounds off at
mums house and then we are driving to
serve a farmhouse we're going for just
one night and I'm really looking forward
to it's very nice at this time of year
should be really beautiful and all
tunnel very cozy you're looking forward
to dying I've not been before no I'm
really excited actually yeah yeah nice
to get some fresh air walk around
hopefully the weather improves well
unfortunately we can't take the dogs
with us because we're staying in the
actual farmhouses time most of it
apparently is dog friendly and but
typically the one time we want to take
the dogs and we've got our car with us
and we can't because our accommodation
is not dog friendly because they're
gonna drop these little boys off at
Lola's house and I will see you at the
farmhouse
Dixie why are you so handsome your
brother sleeping on you is my chickie my
ruining I am The King but he's so
handsome
sometimes my little boy gets a bit
carsick and mommy has to hold him so we
can look out the window I am The King
King
people cannot Nicki I'm just jealous
jealous hey why are you giving extra
attention we just arrived to the
farmhouse and we're staying in the
actual farmhouse I think there's like
two houses you can rent here one of them
is for four bedrooms and this one is for
seven so this is like the biggest
farmhouse apparently the original
farmhouse on this plot and we just come
up to our bedroom and it's seriously a
beautiful major or terminal cozy vibes
have a look at this nice big bed
which looks very cozy and then a bathtub
in the room over here let's have a
little look I've got a nice dressing
table all the cowshed products that you
know and love from so farm houses yeah
this locality I'm hoping to film a cozy
evening routine but I don't know if
there'll be enough light left and then
in the bathroom just this really I have
the color of the walls
what farrowing bald you reckon this is
charm Mizzell no elephants Preston's
grey I think this is missile I thought
you know you're a country bumpkin when
you recognize Pharaoh and bull Shane oh
dear oh dear
very very cozy
it's a little bit later on now and I've
just got changed for dinner I've been
filming a cozy autumn routine in this
beautiful room so had a nice little camp
session as well
I will ask Charlie very kindly to get a
little outfit clip in a few moments when
we head down the stairs but yes we're
heading down for dinner I think we're
going to have a couple of cocktails and
this evening I'm a badly glued to my
youtube subscribe account because I
think as it stands we are on one hundred
ninety nine thousand nine hundred and
eighty seven so that's wait no nine yeah
887 so I've got about 110 120 to go
until hitting 200k which is very
exciting I'll definitely have to have
something sparkly to celebrate hopefully
this evening fingers crossed it's not
quite the same popping a bottle of
champagne over yoga in the morning is it
but yes it's night should be fun I will
show you my outfit and yeah let's go
so because charlie is the world's
slowest man it's getting ready I will
just show you my outfit of the day in
the mirror just in case you didn't get
chance later yes I shall so this is my
ASOS cashmere jumper which I've been
wearing so much lately you guys'll
probably very bored with seeing me
talking about it and my trusty Marks and
Spencer skirts which again I've been
wearing those my Gucci bag I have had
quite a lot of questions if this is new
I actually bought this invested last
year and I've been so excited to get it
out of my wardrobe again and I feel like
it's great for autumn so cut that out
again so please it's still like being
sold kind of feels like a new bag so
definitely a great investment I think
it's gone up a couple of hundred pounds
since last year as well and then for
footwear wise not sure if you can see
but these are my lovely oops Ted Baker
boots which I adore and they're very
comfortable and they go with the kind of
all terminal colors what's your outfit

good morning it's Thursday morning and
we just did some yoga to start the day I
woke up on a bit of a high this morning

they were very very happy this morning
my battery's about to die but very quick
yoga outfit of the day

don't think you guys have seen this
jumper before sorry my camera battery
just died in the middle of chatting to
you in the beautiful bathrooms in the
kind of like fitness well room area here
at Soho farmhouse Charlie and I have
just nipped out to take some outfit
photos it is sadly typical British
weather raining but we're trying to make
the most of it drizzle Charlie behind me
is trying to get a boomerang of his
umbrella because success darling yeah Oh
Jim the life is an instagramer
yeah we had a really nice talk this
morning from a nutritionist who is
giving us tips on like how to avoid
getting flu in winter so I might include
those in like voiceover for my cozy
autumn evening routine but I feel no
tonight and now it's got a little bit of
free time we're just wandering around a
little bit until lunch so I will show
you my outfit of the day and then catch
up with you a little bit later
hello again it is now Thursday evening
oh my gosh it's about say Wednesday I
just cannot seem to keep track of what
day of the week it is this week it's all
a little bit crazy um so yeah we are
obviously at home now no longer at sono
farmhouse and it's half past nine and
I'm not gonna lie I am totally ready for
bed I don't know if it's been all the
excitement's so I really it she knows I
don't know if it's been the excitement
of hitting 200k this morning but I have
just been exhausted today despite having
three or four coffees so gonna have it
any night um this evening I stupidly
didn't film anything while I was there
because I think I was just too busy
chatting but basically this year I was
invited to be a judge on the Sainsbury's
Beauty Awards panel which is so I'm just
honored I think it's just such an
incredible thing to do
big fan and say nose as you guys know
it's our local supermarket they have an
amazing selection of beauty products the
skin care body care all that kind of
thing and this year yeah they asked me
to be one of the judges so it was the
same series Beauty Awards tonight hence
why I am dressed up in my lovely frock
so that was really good fun I just got
home from that I'll very quickly show
you what I wore although you probably
recognize both of these pieces that I'm
wearing them a lot lately
it is my Topshop dress and I think there
are actually a few more of these back in
stock now so if you love it like I do
and then check the links down in the
description box because I think it's
back in stock and then this coat is my
Ted Baker one I am hoping that yesterday
you might have seen a lookbook on my
channel fingers crossed my camera but
she just died like 10 seconds of me
finishing filming saying
coat is from Ted Baker hopefully
yesterday you will have seen a lookbook
video featuring this fingers
cost of editing is done on time but if
not and you'll sing over the first time
I am just in love with this so so so
much has beautiful color and it's just
perfectly like smart but very very
wearable Topshop dress what necklace did
I have on you can really see it oh this
lovely one from Monica Villa de Astra
new earrings and then to finish I have
my burgundy ox blood colored Rhys boots
which I love with this dress so that's
what I wore this evening tomorrow it's
got me a very very fun day because I've
just found out that I'm being given the
keys to the top drop box of Circus store
I'm going in before it opens and I don't
know why that excites me so much but it
sounds pretty darn cool so I'll see you
guys tomorrow morning for that should be
epic fun yeah that night for me
good morning it is Wednesday and I am in
Topshop Aqsa Circus and it's not even
open yet it's about half an hour to that
store officially opens but I've got
store to myself aside from actually load
staff and press because they're
launching their stranger things
collaboration today if you've watched
the show you might recognize this is all
set up behind me over here which is the
Hawkins high school locker area they've
got loads of fun things going in it
going on a press tour today so I'm
having a little look around and then
having a very quick personal shopping
session just before we had to dr. Phil
Therese surreal being here the new eyes
excited you so much it's like coming
here all the time
so we're just browsing around the store
the best thing is all the new clothes
come in and no one has shopped them yet
so they're all in perfect size order
everything is out on the shop floor and
we can just have the store to ourselves
basically take our time wandering around
picking some pizza I've already found
this dress which looks a little bit the
cinnamon type seat so I'm definitely
gonna try that on I'm looking for a nice
chunky knit hopefully they'll keep me
cozy in Boston April sounds nice little
browse and then I'll show you what we
are doing that's quite funny it's like a
clown retro
I've been fairly restrained today I've
picked up this which i think is really
beautiful looks almost like Zimmermann
II but beautiful autumn dress gonna star
that with some ankle boots then I picked
up these he's a jammie Jean so I know
these are gonna fit me and they're like
a coaching material so almost look oh my
god they almost look like leather
trousers I will deal with that in a
second
oh god my nightmare then classic knits
cable net I thought that was really
lovely classic piece just something you
pick up and wear all the time in autumns
and then this one I'm wearing the pink
version of this right now but I thought
that was a really lovely color back home
again now and again my memory card is
full so just gonna finish off on my
camera
I'm only doing five days today as I said
because we're flying to Boston now and
they want to film a totally separate
what I wore in Boston video so this is
my airplane outfit I'm wearing all the
layers and this is my Coast Cape which I
thought would be a really nice kind of
snuggly blanket to just really get cozy
on the plane and then I've got my French
Connection jumper t-shirt tucked in
underneath these are my American Eagle
jeans so basically the most stretchy and
loungewear esque jeans and I own and
then these little boots this is the bag
that I'm taking it's a new one actually
from accessorize I picked it up because
this strap I thought reminded me of the
ANA homage bags and I just thought it
was really beautiful it's burgundy not
sure if you can see in that light but
yeah I thought that was really really
lovely back so taking this with my hand
luggage in and and then I also have
another small suitcase for extras I've
got my M&amp;amp;S cashmere jogging bottoms in
there which I would definitely get
changed into Sims on the plane some
cashmere socks just to make myself
really cozy so yeah this is my flight
outfit and that's where I'm gonna end
the vlog so I really hope you guys
enjoyed it quite a very timeless week
lots of fun things going on but yeah so
stay tuned for lots all
more autumnal content that I will film
while in Boston and that is all from me
