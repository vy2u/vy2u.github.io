another daily vlog I'm sat on the floor
at the moments I've just been doing a
little bit of packing the room is a
little bit of a bomb site I've got
clothes beauty products strewn all over
the place but we are going on our big
trip tomorrow so today's my packing and
pampering day so I thought I'd do a
daily vlog and share with you a few of
the things I like to do to plan for
myself ahead of my holiday because
that's um that's pretty much what I'm up
to you today as well as a little bit of
work as usual so as you saw earlier
first thing this morning a bit of a line
actually which is quite unlike me and
the first thing Charlie and I went to
the gym we did a workout sessions
together which is really really nice
because I find that when I work out with
Charlie it just helps to motivate me a
little bit more he knows what I'm doing
a lot better than I do so it definitely
helps when he needs kind of show me what
to do with is a lot of legs
lots of lunges lots of weights yeah
feeling a little bit knackered and then
I had a really lovely pampering session
in the gym so I don't normally pamper in
the gym but actually our hot water it's
been a little bit hit-and-miss recently
and I did not want to miss out on a good
pamper so that's what I did so if you
remember my come to the Sun with me vlog
where I took you guys to the weather
salon and I had that fantastic hair
treatment which was all as a result of
me generating my energy code you'll know
that I now have this incredible bespoke
systems my hair I filled out all the
questions on the iPad and the lovely
guys in the salon had a real good look
at my hair asking lots of questions and
I was prescribed a hair treatment system
which is my personal energy code and
I'll leave that flog links down below so
you can remind yourself or check it out
if you're not too sure what I'm talking
about
but yeah it's a new and
gcode system from weather scan
professional and after that I then got
some home care products as well so these
are again it shows them to my exact hair
specifications there the fact that my
hair is a little bit dry it's a little
colored it needs a little bit of love
these products are really tailored to me
so what I use first of all this one is
solar this is a hair and body shampoo so
I mean obviously I just use it on my
hair because there's two pressures for
me to want to use that my body but you
can use on your body if you want to I'll
be taking this one on holiday with me
because this is actually summer
rehydration so it's really good for your
hair has been some damage but also great
for colored hair if like mine the bleach
has potentially damaged your hair a
little bit so this is really great
reconstructing the hair as you can see
and I get this quite a lot my hair is
pretty shiny considering it's been
colored I'm always being told by
hairdressers and friends that my hair
feels like it's in really good condition
and that's because my hair products are
tailored to my hair so they really are
doing the best possible job that they
could do so that's why I use first this
is part of the energy code range so
you'll get prescribed your very own
products if you find out your energy
code and then it because my hair is dry
and colored the energy code system that
prescribes me this which is called at
the color safe mask and this is intense
color protection there is nothing worse
than spending a small fortune getting
your hair colored only to find that it
fades a few days later I'm really really
happy with my hair color at the moment
so I don't want it going anywhere this
is a really thick mask so it's not one
of these like gel consistencies it
really is a thick mask but not only does
it help look after the hair color so it
prevents any premature color fading but
also it's specially designed to treat
colored hair so has been colored may
lose some of its shine it may loosen
that strength and this really helps to
put some of that goodness back into the
hair so in case you missed it in my last
vlog my come to someone with me vlog
I've teamed up with Weller to let you
guys have your own energy code
experience completely bespoke to your
hair needs and so what you've got to do
in order to enter is click on the link
in the
description box I've left a link in the
description which will take you to the
weather system professional website
where you can generate your own energy
code by filling out some questions about
your hair so then once you've got the
code leave it in the comment section
below and let me know about a hair
experience that you have had in the past
year or something coming up in the next
year that requires you to have fabulous
hair just let me know in the comments
and I will choose winner very very soon
I'll announce it probably on my
Instagram and my Twitter so yeah keep an
eye on that next up as part of my
pampering routine was fake tanning
so I'm very pale and as you can see but
I have been applying a little bit of
time at gradually over the past few days
first thing that I do is obviously scrub
at my skin I did a video a little while
ago about my fake telling tips so again
I'll leave that link down below but
scrubbing the skin before tanning is
really really important because tan
sticks to any dry patches so you don't
want to have any dry patches of skin so
I used a Sienna X body scrub the gentle
exfoliation one really like that when
it's got quite small granules that
readers gem 638 you then I covered my
body
Hammond's on my face yet covered my body
in this which is the CNR X deep self tan
lotion so did this open the gym changing
rooms would run at home if I'd have had
hot water but this will develop continue
developing 4s today it's an eight-hour
developer at last up to a week and I'm
really like the color that this gives
I'm old hand and then it's night I've
got the girls coming round we're going
to have a really lovely girly evening
we've got a company coming around if you
give us some lovely treatment I think
when you get a massage get a pedicure
and then I'm going to show you how I do
my own gel nails at home so I'm using
normal nail varnish and the gel topcoat
so that my nails last a long time we're
on a holiday so I'm going to go and do a
little bit more work now and I'll catch
up with you guys bit later okay it's a
couple of hours later than a little bit
of work in the afternoon and Charlie
made a lovely soup I'm now heading into
town and I'm doing a meet-up with like
snow at Europe they've just launched a
new Instagram account
I'm going to go to London Fashion Week
and have them look around and then
hopefully meet a couple of you guys
although I've got a sneaky feeling that
no one's going to tell now this is going
to be me or when my lonesome but let's
go and check it out back home again now
has so much fun it's festival it's a
really great way of experiencing Fashion
Week if you don't get going to the shows
you still get to experience
vx Ignis of London Fashion Week so yeah
I went to the likes to know it lounge

company that means that when you like my
Instagram photos you automatically get

really good service yeah that was really
good fun I got to speak to loads of
lovely people they're back home again

excited to it's the masks appeal from
bliss around here I've got a little
selection of products in the middle of
the table this is just like a beauty
