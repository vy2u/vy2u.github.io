me for another haul video here on my
youtube channel so today I'm going to be
sharing with you a few of the beautiful
festive pieces that I have bought
recently that hopefully I'll be wearing
over the Christmas and New Year period
so these are mostly kind of sequined
party dresses that kind of thing and for
a lot of these I've actually already
worn a few of them and filmed really
beautiful clips of me kind of trying
them on and wearing them at various
events so this is actually going to be a
haul slash lookbook so you're going to
get a really lovely feel on how they
look and how they move that kind of
thing so yeah my first haul slash
lookbook let me know in the comments if
you like this kind of thing and if you
think I should do those kind of Tryon
clips for my future hauls in 2018 so I'm
gonna get started with my favorites
Topshop and you may have spotted this
one on my blog and my Instagram so I did
wear it to the jo Malone Christmas
breakfast this has beautiful peacock
style feather sequins on it and it is a
midi term maxi length dress so very
elegant lengths I think it's very
flattering it does have a slightly
cinched in waist but you definitely have
enough room to really go crazy on the
old turkey dinner there's plenty of
moving room in here I think that a
little black dress with sequins on is a
real failsafe option as Christmas for
those of you that do like to wear the
little black dress then just adding a
few sequins as a really nice way to add
a festive touch to a very classic outfit
this next one is a little bit of risque
for me it's definitely a Christmas party
dress it is very short in fact so short
that a few of my friends asked me if I
was wearing a top because I'm short it
is but this is from a retailer called I
saw it first very very affordable which
is great if like me you maybe don't go
to too many parties you're a little bit
of a granny but you want to dress up
every now and then and you want
something that's really dazzling and a
real statement piece I do think this is
very flattering and despite the fact
that it being figure-hugging I did feel
very confident wearing this it is short
but it doesn't kind of move its way up
the body so I didn't have to keep
tugging it down which is a major bonus
it's got that kind of slightly grippy
sticky fabric around the neckline so it
doesn't slip down either but I would
definitely recommend a good strapless
bra to wear this as well and I
this with a faux feather jacket and faux
fur the handbag from the same retailer
the whole outfit came to under 70 pounds
so very very affordable for a dazzling
at Christmas party look this is another
really great affordable option it is
from Miss Selfridge and I believe this
was around 42 pounds this is a jumpsuit
and I think it's really nice to mix it
up between dresses and jumpsuits and of
course sparkly jumpers and skirt
combinations but again because this is
mostly black I thought very flattering
very easy to wear it's got this
elasticated waist area and then very
thin spaghetti straps that look really
beautiful against the skin I'm afraid I
haven't had a chance to try this one on
yet so this is full length they are
slightly not really flourish maybe a
slight flare to them but they are wide
all the way down so a very flattering
design a little bit retro if you're
going to maybe a themed party then these
could work this could work really well
for that and I think the star print is
very festive but not too limiting so a
great one to just Bank in your wardrobe
for those special occasions another one
from Topshop and the design on this one
is probably my favorite of all of the
festive dresses it has this sheer
material going over it with varying
embellished stars so some of the stars
have got little Swarovski crystals on
them well they're not sort of crystals
they're just sparkly beads some of them
are just thread some of them are little
pearlized beads but lots of variety lots
of different stars and once again it's a
little black dress essentially with this
crossover detail so getting lots of
trend points but it's still very festive
thanks to this sheer overlay with the
stars on does also have an asymmetric
hem so you're taking that winter trend
too so a very very versatile dress takes
lots of boxes and I think if you're
going I think if you're going to a work
function then this is a really good
dress for that you don't need to worry
about what you're wearing you won't feel
self-conscious wearing something like
this but it is a very very beautiful
design another one here that I've not
yet tried on but I think this could be a
really good contender for New Year's Eve
parties again from Miss Selfridge this
was 32 pounds so very very good price
and it may even go down on the Boxing
Day sales I know Miss Selfridge often do
sales like that too
but as you can see on the camera this is
a totally does link design it's got
these sequin details running all the way
through it's really beautiful
lightweight material and is a dress but
it's not
short I would say this would come to
just below mid-thigh levels it's not too
revealing and because it's got this nice
slit in the back and yet high neckline
you feel like having bare legs is
balanced out by the amount of material
at the top here and long sleeves so if
you're not one that usually wears short
dresses I think this is a nice kind of
beginners short dress one more from
Topshop and a lot of you were loving
this and featured it on my Instagram
recently this is a beautiful pink foil
II material dress I featured this in a
blog post about how to choose your
perfect Christmas dress style I'll leave
that link down below if you would like
to read my tips on how to choose a
perfect Christmas dress but I said that
something like this is great if you do
have a very feminine style and you don't
want to completely disregard your
signature star for Christmas parties
then this is a really beautiful option
for that the metallic foil detail of the
fabric does give it that festive vibe as
does the kind of bow tie detail at the
back but it's pink at the end of the day
so you can still be ultra feminine but
festive to this next dress you may have
spotted if you've been catching up with
my vlogmas videos or my not really
vlogmas my daily vlogs throughout
December I wore this to the Dior dinner
at the Ritz it was such a spectacular
evening and I felt really really
fabulous in this is needle and thread I
got it on ASOS I will leave this and all
the other dresses I mentioned linked
down below if you want to treat yourself
but such a beautiful dress it's
obviously got this gorgeous
embellishment along the top sequins and
little crystals it's got some frill
detail around the neckline
spaghetti straps which are adjustable
which is great so you can tailor it to
your sizing and then this tool material
on the skirt which is so princessy and
it's the perfect length as well I'd say
very elegant length for a very feminine
and yet classic look this next beautiful
number you may instantly think that it's
needle and thread in fact I did and I've
been calling it my needle and thread
dress but actually this is a sauce own
brand a sauce are really upping their
game when it comes to party wear this
year and this dress is just absolutely
stunning I will insert either a photo of
me wearing it or a photo of a model
wearing it here unfortunate didn't take
any video clips wearing this which I'm
very annoyed with myself for but it is a
gorgeous dress it is very much a
occasion dress not one to just wear
around the dinner table with your family
on Christmas Day but if you're going to
a really spectacular affair on New
Year's Eve perhaps or a pre Christmas
dinner party that the dress code is
glamorous for then this would be a
really lovely number essentially it's
just a long silky material dress which
has the most beautiful hang but then it
has got this very needle and thread
style bodice which just pins together at
the back like a cape a really beautiful
design very striking and a lot more
affordable than actual needle and thread
so that is a rather beautiful one and
last but not least I have a couple of
designs from Ted Baker
I feel like tobacco is one of my go-to
zhh when it comes to gorgeous evening
wear they have some seriously
spectacular dresses in their store at
the moment in fact one that I don't have
here it's not part of the haul but that
I did wear for a recent photo shoot I
will hopefully insert the video clip
here was probably the dress that I felt
the most special I'd ever felt in a
dress in in my life that made no sense
but I think I've got my point across
anyway it was just most spectacular
dress big ballgown style skirt
beautifully tight-fitting bodice so
that's I would highly recommend if
you've got something incredible to go to
if you're going to a Christmas wedding
maybe that would be absolutely fabulous
that's the ones I picked up in my haul
of moving back to the hall and this one
I think is really cute
it is a black or maybe dark navy dress
it's a lovely length once again just
above the knee so a really love you
feminine length and then Ted Baker have
lots of designs with little bees or I
think there was actually on a lot of
their designs this autumn winter and
this has those created out of little
beads really intricate detailing and
then you've got this frill detail around
the waistline I paired this with my
Chloe bracelet bag it looked really
beautiful and my Valentino shoes as well
they are my go-to accessories when it
comes to festive parties and I'll be
wearing them for pretty much all of my
Christmas parties and lastly one which
is a little bit more suited to my style
I don't wear dark colors that much
obviously a lot of these have been
pretty dark but this one is technically
not a festive dress but it is a dress
that I will be wearing over the festive
season another one from Ted Baker
I love the scalloped detail along the
bodice of this one and then the
scalloped detail goes down the skirt as
well hopefully the camera is picking
this up a really lovely detail I think
if you were to wear some metallic or
gold sparkly sequined accessories then
you could definitely make this work for
a Christmas event but equally when the
springtime does roll around this will be
a really lovely design to wear in the
new year as well so I thought I would
include this one because it's beautiful
and I'm very excited to wear it so those
are the dresses and pieces that I have
been picking up recently for the festive
season
I will leave absolutely all of these
dresses as well as the pieces that I use
to accessorize them in the video clips

more if you'd like to see more on the
items as I mentioned I do have a few

Christmas dress so I'll leave that blog
