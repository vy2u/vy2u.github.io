you for joining me for today's video
which is the final video of fashion
mumbler all week I really hope you've
enjoyed going through a load of my
purchases this week we've had everything
from ASOS to I know I haven't had a
source my memory card died oh I still
haven't got over that but I might film
another a sauce for next week but you
had everything from Primark boots an
Oxford Street haul to misguided so it'll
live everything and this last one is a
bit different and I've never seen
anything like this on youtube before but
it is a pharmacy haul so pharmacies are
a little bit underrated in my opinion on
places to get beauty products and you
can often find things that are stronger
that just are almost medical brands that
you sometimes need to get
over-the-counter so I felt like they're
quite interesting to do a pharmacy haul
and I also picked up some quite
practical things so the pharmacy that I
went to was weak more medical and
Wigmore medical is behind doctor Street
on Wigmore Street as you might be able
to guess from the name so it's pretty
much parallel to Oxford Street and it's
maybe like two minutes walk behind
debenhams that's pretty much where it is
so I nipped in there with Charlie couple
of days ago and we picked up some really
useful bits and bobs which I thought I
would share with you so as I said a few
of these are very practical but there
are some beauty and skincare bits and
bobs in there as well I'm just gonna
pull things out in my bag at random and
the first thing I pulled out is eyedrops
so a very exciting thing to start this
off but I picked up the lubra still
eyedrops I don't really like the name I
think it sounds really disgusting but
the reason why I got these is because I
used these as my eye drops after I had
laser eye surgery about four years ago
god I can't believe it's been four years
maybe it's three years ago I don't know
time flies but yeah I used these after
my surgery and they were just really
great at lubricating the eye that's
pretty much what they do and these are
more Phil's brand so more filters the
eye hospital in East London and they're
just very
if you suffer from dry eyes these are
amazing and they come in little tiny
I'll show you
they come in metal foil packets like
this you get loads of these packets how
many other one two three four and each
one has five times three mil Northpoint
three mil doses which means that you
only need to break them open when you
need to use it and then you have about
two or three uses in each one whereas
the normal eye drops like op tracks once
you've opened it you have to use it then
two weeks I think which I never do
whereas these are pretty much single or
two or three users per each one and it
means you can like keep them in your
drawer for a lot longer so yes picks up
those very exciting first thing to start
on does get more exciting than that I
promise next is a lavender pure
essential aromatherapy oil from a brand
called health aid and Charlie and I have
a oil humidifier in our bedroom and
Troy's been having trouble sleeping
recently so I picked up this lavender
oil and we'll pop it in our diffuser and
it will just power out steam that smells
of lavender and make our bedroom very
beautiful and spa like they had a huge
range of these oils in Wigmore medical
and annoyingly they don't say what each
oil does I probably would have picked up
a few more if it did but this just says
lavender on it I know love and is good
for sleeping so I picked up one of those
next I picked up the intensive therapy
from a brand called NeoStrata this is
not a brand I've heard of before but
when I mentioned that under-eye
puffiness was my main facial look
concern the girls behind the counter
were very adamant that I absolutely had
to try this so upon the recommendation I
picked it up and it does say that it's
formulated - this is a long word
synergistically correct all visible
signs of aging for a lifted firmer
younger look but I cannot tell you how
adamant these girls were that they were
incredible I actually picked up a more
expensive brand of under-eye treatment
gel and they recommended this over the
top of the more expensive one so I'm
really looking forward to trying this I
know it always say it in my whole videos
but if you want to see first impressions
then keep an eye on my
that because of doing first impressions
of all these types of pieces then I have
the suede mat crayon from a brand called
glow minerals which I have actually
spoken about before on my youtube
channel and I've never seen glow I've
never seen glow of minerals in a shot
before but they had a lovely big counter
in the week medical store so I did
blades of swatching and decided to pick
up the shade monogrammed it's just my
typical color a really really beautiful
shade and wearing something fairly
similar at the moment actually which is
very surprising it's from the Jay Manuel
yes the judge from America's Next Top
Model is from his new PT range from QVC
so just write that out I really really
like it
but this is quite similar and because
it's from glowing minerals you know that
it's lovely mineral base makeup really
good for the skin nice and nourishing
not going to dry out the lips so that's
the lovely one I also got color matched
for a powder within the glow and
minerals range and I chose the pressed
base powder foundation and I've been
using powder a lot more recently
especially for filming because I look so
charming if I don't put any on but also
my skin does get oily as the day goes on
and I do need a powder mineral powders
are by far my favourite as I said with
the lip product the ingredients are just
so much better when the mineral base
from much better for the skin not going
to be clogging the pores this one it
says dust the face using the ultra brush
which I thought I'd picked up but it
looks like I must have forgotten to put
it by itself but yeah you can just use
like a fan brush or a really light
effect set to your base application with
hydration mess up some interesting
reapply after sun exposure oh okay so
you really are meant to use this as a
foundation so it's saying to set your
base application with a mist and then
reapply after sun exposure or if you
sweat which kind of makes sense
but I'm probably going to use this just
as a powder over the top of my existing
makeup color wise this is just a perfect
color match for me when the lady color
match to me I couldn't even see where it
was on the skin which is a very good
sign it's really lovely and compact as
well you've got a mirror in the lid and
a sponge within it so it's going to be a
really good one to keep in my hand
as well next so I picked up something
really practical this is the event or
Avena never really know how to pronounce
it I think it's been um clearance Oakley
Nantes micellar water I actually picked
up a couple of other my slow waters in
Boots the other day for some of its
always Charlie yesterday maybe and
you'll see that I picked up a few muscle
waters then but you can never have too
many I find them so practical use them
twice a day every day as my first
cleanse before going in with a proper
cleanser then I really love all their
skin care and I've never seen such a big
bottle of this my salaah water before so
I thought would be a really good one to
grab this one is specifically for oily
and blemish prone skin so I might switch
this into my skin care routine on those
days and I do feel like my skin is
starting to get a little bit congested I
also asked the girls behind the counter
if they could recommend a face mask for
clearing out skin and reducing my pore
size because that is another of my
skincare concerns what I really liked
about the whole experience at Wigmore
Medical was that the girls were just so
knowledgeable there they really listened
to my skincare concerns I'm able to
recommend really good products which is
something that you just don't get in
places like boots so I was recommended
the globe therapeutics which I'm
guessing because it's written same as go
minerals it's the same brand but they've
got skincare Beauty and this is their
refining mask so this is specifically an
oil absorbing clay mask which I love as
Australia so I'm sure he'll be nicking
this too and comes inflammation or
irritation rather while proving the
blemish to fighting ingredients reducing
principles and refined skin texture this
is recommended for oily in combination a
pre acne prone skin my skin isn't really
acne prone but if it can deal with acne
prone skin that I'm sure that it will be
able to deal with the odd blemish that I
get so once again I'm going to be
showing this tonight actually coz I have
got quite a few spots I put some
concealer on so hopefully you can't see
them I'm going to try this out tonight
so keep an eye on my snapchat for the
first impressions also within the
pharmacy there were a huge selection of
vitamins to be honest I did not know
where to start thank God I had Charlie
with me and he was telling me about the
kind of vitamins that I need although
the shop assistants would have helped as
well if I'd have asked that Charlie kind
of took over a little bit
imagine so I picked up the skin nails
and hair formula 60 tablets from a brand
called soul girl this is not a brand
that I've ever seen before I've never
seen it on the high street never seen it
in places like boots so I'm guessing
it's more of a niche brand and one that
probably requires a little bit more
interaction with the staff in the store
yeah I'm intrigued to try these it says
they're gonna improve my skin hair nails
which is something that I'm always
interested in as a food supplement take
two tablets daily preferably a meal time
yeah I've got high hopes for these if
they improve my skin my nails my head
and I'll be very very happy they did
have loads of other tablets there but
similarly to the oils didn't say what
each tablet did like it said if it was
ink or magnesium or whatever I didn't
know what these things did I could have
stood down googled it but um I didn't
have time for that but if you are
looking for a very specific type of
vitamin I am sure we could medical will
have it because they had so many types
of vitamins and this one was pretty much
the only one that said what body part it
helped and I thought I could do with
that so one of those in my basket too
and finally and this is actually what
I'm most excited about this is a kind of
a trial kit but it's not really trial
because it's really good size products
from zero skin health and again I'd not
heard of zero skin health before but
it's pretty much the brand that the
Wigmore medical champion because I hope
this is right
they are the UK its sole distributor so
you can pick this up behind the counter
you can be prescribed it if you've had
some times if you have that cosmetic
surgery or if we have got a real serious
skin condition you can be prescribed
products in this range you can actually
buy it from the store on Whitmore
medical I picked up a couple of bits and
bobs and then the girls actually said
I'd be better off picking up this
because it's far far far cheaper this I
believe is 120 pounds I think it was a
hydrogen 20 but the value of the protein
in it is I think more than double that
so inside this is the daily skincare
program inside really neat you can see
I've got five products and they are all
really good size so they're bit smaller
than
the retail size you can buy on their own
but a very good size particularly if you
just want to try out and discover the
brand which I did so in the store I
discovered that zero have a five-step
skincare routine and this basically
covers all of those steps the first one
being an exfoliating cleanser so I think
that is this one exfoliating polish and
I felt this they had a little tester in
the store and I felt this in the store
and what I loved about it and made me
want to pick it up is that the granules
are so fine but there's so many of them
so you're going to feel like I'm getting
a really good scrub and a lot of the
brands that I can find on the high
street they're great and everything but
they just don't really give your skin a
really good scrub and sometimes if you
have Baron skin or you just if you work
in the city I think sometimes you just
want to take the day off and you want to
give your skin a really good clean so
that's what I feel that this is going to
be amazing for oh so actually this is
the exfoliating polish and this is the
exfoliating cleanser and this one I
haven't tried but this I'm guessing is
just going to be a little bit more
appropriate for daily use where's on the
occasions when you do want to have a
really good cleanse that's this one
but both of them are in the kit so this
is I guess daily cleansing and then on
those days when you want to almost give
yourself an at-home facial for a super
deep exfoliation then let's see what the
box says is next oh okay these were what
really drew me to the brand and I was
going to buy these on their own they are
the tea pads acne poor treatment so
again it keeps using the word acne but
you don't have to have acne to try this
range I just want it to give it a go
because I have heard on good authority
that it really works so in the books I
have 20 single-use packets of these
little sachets which are the pads soaked
in a formula which will help to refine
the skin so it says that the pads are
moistened in 2% salicylic acid to reduce
sebum exfoliate pore clogging dead skin
cells and remove dirt and oil I'm not
sure if you can even buy that high
concentration of salicylic acid in
normal high street stores again this is
an over-the-counter product and how to
be recommended it so it's going to be
really good
hopefully it says for external use only
don't use on damaged or broken skin and
of course it isn't actually
so you need to make sure that none of
the other ingredients with your skincare
routine are going to crash with it your
skin might be a little bit sensitive
after you use this and sometimes I do
feel a tingling but I actually really
like that tingling sensation because it
makes me feel like my skin is actually
being cleaned and the dirt is really
being drawn out so I love that these are
also single-use sachets great for
traveling you can just rip it open clean
your face especially if you're going
somewhere on a city break if you live in
the countryside and you go to New York
your skin is going to be really like wow
what is going on with all the dirt in
the air so something like this we great
- really deep cleanse the skin
personally living and working in London
they're gonna recreate anyway the next
step is their daily power defense and I
actually learnt that zo do not advise
that you use moisturizer because it's
just an additional step that you don't
need and it creates a bit of a block
over the skin so this is I guess their
alternative and it basically just helps
the skin to defend itself
so whereas moisturizer does the job for
your skin this trains the skin to
moisturize itself so what it says is you
just apply to your three pumps of your
face massaging the skin to increase
absorption penetration and then making
sure that you follow with an SPF which
is the final product in the range it's a
primer but it contains SPF 30 as you
guys know I always use at least SPF 30
on my face and this is a sunscreen and
primer all in one really really handy so
I'll be able to use this as easy the way
opening wasn't expecting that I'll be
able to apply my makeup straightaway
after this so all of those pieces that
came in this very handy kit and yes the
phase one daily skincare programs so I
think that's a really good way of
discovering more about brand I as you
guys know don't really like to blog
about the skincare products until I've
been trying it for about three weeks so
if I get along really really well with
this and you will be hearing from me in
a little while so I'm intrigued to try
it out these products just sound like
they're very strong and then the hope
we're going to really work so I will
keep you updated as to how I get along
with them hope you found this
interesting and very very different
halls and very practical products and
good skincare that you may or may not
have heard of before so hopefully a
different style haul and you guys
enjoyed watching it if you did give it a
thumbs up if you've got any ideas on any
other types of slightly different rules
you'd like to see then let me know
because as you know I like shopping and
I like sharing it with you so any cool
ideas please let me know and yeah
overall I would just say if you have got
a skin care concern but maybe you're not
ready to go and see a specialist then
going somewhere like a pharmacy probably
would be a really good idea this one as
I said Wigmore pharmacy just behind
Oxford Street really easy to get to and
conveniently near High Street too so if
you go gonna get your eyebrows and micro
bladed or anything like that it's really
close by so good place to pop into I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did then give it a thumbs up if you've
got any pharmacy products that you've
been loving recently let me know in the
comments below because I'd love to pick
up a few more things in these kind of
stores so let me know in the comments
what your favorite pharmacy pouches are
I hope you enjoyed this video subscribe
