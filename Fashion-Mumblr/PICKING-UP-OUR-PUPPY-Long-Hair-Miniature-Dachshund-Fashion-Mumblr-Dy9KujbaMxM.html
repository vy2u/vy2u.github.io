daily vlog but today's daily vlog as you
will already know from the title and the
thumbnail is going to be a very special
one because today Charlie and I are
adding to our little family and we're
getting a new puppy so I'm feeling kind
of nervous exciting butterflies deja vu
because I also vlogged the day that we
picked up little Dexter and yes today's
vlog is probably going to be quite
similar I'll leave that one links down
below in case you want to see that and
maybe compare how much things have
changed blog wise since then also take
note of my teeth because when I watch
that back all I can see is how bad my
teeth are anyway so yeah it's Saturday
today we are having to keep everything
kind of under wraps because actually we
haven't told any of our family or
friends for a couple of close friends
that we're getting a new puppy so
tomorrow's vlog is going to be really
exciting so they're going to be
introducing him and like surprising
everybody with him so we're getting a
new long hair meant to Daxi just the
same as Dex from a different breeder and
he's all the way up in Leeds so we're
going to be driving for three and a half
hours later but it's going to be worth
it when we get there and meet our little
chap but first of all today I am going
to the Lumiere studio or loom Yelland
and to do a little talk with Manfrotto
which is a brand that have photography
equipment I'm doing a talk on how to
build a successful YouTube channel so
I'm going to head there first and then
we'll be in the car heading up to Leeds
and I'll show you what we're taking in
our doggie bag because I showed you that
last time as well but I feel like this
time we're a little bit more prepared we
know a bit more so I'll show you what
we're taking with us to collect the new
puppy and just a few learnings basically
from the last time but now it's time to
head to the master class and I'll see
you a little bit later
full of hours later got home from the
master class and it went so well I don't
think I blogged very much at all there
it was all a little bit manic but some
of the lovely girls and guys that
attended took some photos I'll put some
photos on the screen now so I can see
what it was like the really cool space
in Southwark and a really kind of
instrument workshop and I just gave a
few tips on YouTube and like little tips
and tricks on how to grow your channel
and I think everybody found it really
useful then at the end we did like a Q&amp;amp;A
and I learnt so much so many tips I
haven't even heard about before and I
think I might do a whole video on the
tips that I gave and the tip that I
learned so definitely let me know if
that's something you might be interested
in
I've just got home got changed in my
happy collecting outfits of them really
comfy and cozy and we're about to head
out I was just making myself some soup
the noodles I'm going to eat in the car
for three and a half hour drive when
we're in my car I will show you what's
in the doggy bag
but yeah so we're heading up to leave
and not looking for too long car journey
I got car six just in over back canucks
in the master class but yeah it's going
to be worth it so let's go before I go
can we just appreciate these flowers so
Charlie got me these for our five year
anniversary and now they are all
blooming and they just look absolutely
stunning so so beautiful this one's had
better days
okay we are successfully on the roof
I have polished off my sleep noodles and
my yogurt much to charli's discuss my
purpose I got soda is no salmon
scrambled eggs and spinach
authorative session taking a little
Josie msg full if I was thinking as we
cross down
major de da boom when we went in picked
up Dexter we didn't have this car that
is actually tallied like different cars
but we rented this car last time and
when we are crossing that bridge we both
we had the radio on and Justin Bieber
what do you mean was like the song from
like it was one of the first time I'd
ever heard it and you know it's got that
like we thought it was the car indicated
going off the hole I remember I just me
buddy has it want to because it was what
do you mean she's gotta like yeah
and we toy was quite indicators I had
major database but I feel like this
video is going to be the exact same give
of that video and we're on a motorway
yeah well just okay it's all wrinkly by
the way Jack stays at my mom's house in
case you're wondering where he is our
family do not know that we're getting
another copy I'm so excited to see
everyone's reactions tomorrow and the
yahoos of Stan's day and we could think
he will really love no one hunts on the
Lumia I'm going to be done out all right
he will really love the new chapter new
little CH and then after a few hours
because I'm ready to go home and then
it'd be like why is this no chap in my
car yeah it's going to be like what do
you I don't know they're not coming to
my house and and then I think when we
get home it might kick off yeah we'll
see hopefully their best of friends
but yeah it's saying that we've got
three hours and 41 minutes in the car so
that means we're going to get there
about half 6:00
I think that's why breeders knew that we
were committed because he was like you
haven't even asked me where I live my
god I don't really like care what you
live for come with me yeah and like we
live in Leeds alright my schedule 8-hour
round trip oh my goodness I'll be worth
it so these breeders by the way there is
a very small chance that we could leave
empty-handed
because these breeders have actually had
a couple of people come and visit this
dog already and they've not let them
take him because they're so precious if
you go see which I really like that make
a really happy what's nice is they're
sort of like it should be down there
hope yeah three dogs not not lots of
business yeah you don't ever want to go
somewhere and hear that they breed
the bitches like every time they come in
season four so bad for the dog so I
think it's if you're looking to get a
sausage dog just be so different will
any dog ever research fear your research
make sure that they're like Kennel Club
registered make sure that they are in it
for the nerves and passion and not for
the money because there's nothing worse
than finding out it's like a puppy farm
or something really upsetting I think
also the nice thing is both times we
want a cup of coffee as it's Beneke sit
with if you've a poppy up yeah I think a
lot of people have these there's nothing
to get people to do it but personally I
could never do that whole let's go see
some puppies and you choose oh my god I
couldn't love her for that yeah
luckily when we went to get Dexter he
was the last one left the little tiny
with the most energy yeah so it like we
didn't have to make a choice and this
time the little boy picking up now is
the only one in the missa big mouse okay
sir thank you yeah you want yeah I think
so so excited so I'll catch up with you
guys shortly when we're on a motorway
there's not like something starting and
I'll show you what's in our doggie bag
hey don't you look at their their
background what you're looking at a baby
something for me excuse me
now come away about 30 miles and
126 let's go so it's a long stretch
until in the north of sidekick pain but
I use opportunities to go through and
organize the big bag itself is a knobby
carry bag I want for that crash when you
are going to get another copy but it's
making a lip up boxing bed type carry
bag like memory I still face them in
cars are speeding up against the pine
cones as soon as you get in the car but
because we quite me get back to my
semester so to the side I have got a new
rug so rather bad gentle connection so
when we get there were going to put this
down with his mummy and his friends I
think about five doctors are very
powerful so between those dogs will have
very comforting smile
we have to take it and think about it
with us and hopefully our chap is on the
cutting edge of the deck while it works
really well until you started throwing
arms though next era of the most
profound self
yeah expert of the three fantastic man
and why shouldn't I get daddy upon it's
about time you come prepared with baby
wipes and kick your role in well
certainly in my handbag
yes okay sir Allah baby one just in case
he doesn't get the SPECIAL make our bag
and this bag
Charlie I occasionally didn't say that
day whether you use the breaking in rain
we also got some tree in the decks of
favorite they are the Purina again now
get in por favor
oh we've got a little collapse or small
I got a order for timing star
beg
and it'll need so that we can take care
now so she begs halfway through the
journey home and then we've got this
teeny teeny finding it'll harden it
again we got some amethyst still smells
like Dexter to me obviously carry
texture home we get so tiny you would
not think so now that we held on spread
and we've got the baby wipes obviously
I'm not going to be writing in this just
in case to you to pick a little boy and
I think that's about it to bring a toy
that was a toy
no we don't have a toy it's going to be
yeah hopefully you know to speak much
the way home and yeah but we thought I
don't know if I go anything extra once
we've picked up Dexter again I'll leave
that video to this down below
I feel like this what we need without
going overboard actually I remember I
did to conserve for content like like
take note zero to last time but
I can I can memorize them this time so
we have got
honey ahead of us yeah and in 2002 20
miles left on this my way around the m1
so I guess I'll see you in an hour
okay we made it through the increasing
film motorway journey and without six
minutes away and don't kick him and why
we can never think of society nervous
because I'm not I just giving a
direction is not a song that I can tell
part me thinking like a nasty like a
tiger
I don't think I'll be over there again
we're to these dog owners and if I
suddenly start punishing a camera
hopefully the next time maybe I'll have
a little boy okay here's the big moment

emotional goodbye I think even more
