having a really fab day today I feel
today I would do another blogger mail or
Pio Vauxhall unboxing type video because
you guys seem to really really like my
last one and when i snapchatted some of
you like yes still another one so I was
in Hong Kong last week which meant I
didn't go down to my dawdle / p.o box
for a good 10 days or so which means I
am completely surrounded by packages at
the moment making it the perfect time to
sit down and open up some meal with you
guys before I get started I wanted to
let you know that I have pretty much
assaulted my video uploading schedule
now it's only taken me about 7 months to
do so but basically I am trying to
upload 3 videos every single week so on
Mondays I'm doing like a one-minute kind
of makeup which is a sped up video
either doing a makeup or hair tutorial
Wednesdays are fashion beauty lifestyle
whatever and and Sunday's are my usual
kind of mostly beauty videos so
hopefully you guys will stick around for
those you can subscribe to my channel if
you don't want to miss any I'll put a
little button here so you can subscribe
though I'm armed with my trusty nail
scissors and I'm going to get started
with this ginormous black one here I
have no idea who this is from
I always try and play a game with myself
and like look at the envelope and try
and figure out who it's from
but this just has someone's name on it
Verity smell I don't know who that
person is and so yeah let's have a
little look ok so inside the black
envelope was a black box with tea tea on
it I still don't really know what this
is so let's have a little look tea - we
are tea okay I remember this now I've
got an email from this tea company so
inside I think this should be a lovely
little teapot let's have a look put the
little tea strainer this silver thing
which you put your tea bags in got a box
of French Elle Grey tea very snazzy
some just calomel and I go make myself
one of those soon as well as soon as I'm
done filming and a box of green rose tea
which sounds really lovely then we have
a very snazzy
teacup this looks almost Moroccan with a
silver handle feels very fine on my
China yeah fine bone china so I need to
be SuperDuper careful with that one and
we have been matching sources so this is
like a lovely kind of teal color which
picks up the teal shades from the teacup
a very snazzy coven saucer so look
forward to making my tea out of those
I'm such a huge tea lover so any kind of
fancy tea and crockery I just absolutely
love so thank you tea too next I have a
little carrier bag from clinic so we
might have a few makeup goodies in here
let's have a little look so this is a
blemish on line correcting serum that's
interesting developed specifically for
adult skin to experiencing breakouts
along with lines and wrinkles so it
sounds like a really good product for
those I think that late 20s if you're
starting to think about aging but also
have the odd blemish and who doesn't
have the odd blemish has a nice kind of
neutral smell to it as well not clinical
like you'd expect it to be so I look
forward to giving that little go and I
will keep you updated as to how I get
along with that then I've got a very
snazzy pink envelope which says perfume
aftershave on the back so that gives the
game away a little bit I love all these
fancy envelopes I always keep them never
post anything really but always handy to
have some envelopes in the house okay I
don't think it's perfume at all it must
be like a standard envelope I've got a
Lee Stafford massive hairbrush on my big
fat silky smoother one of those Unser
ammok barrel brushes and then also a
paddle brush which I absolutely love how
the brushes might resume one is pretty
much falling apart it is so old and this
one is bright pink which is absolutely
gorgeous infused with nano silver to
smooth and create amazing shine
sounds incredible I'll let you know how
I get along with that by the way if you
want to see first impressions when I try
things like this out and beauty products
make sure you follow my snapchat I
always snap first impressions but these
look really fab on a whole note date on
my hair brushes and so long so very well
timed as well
Thank You Lee Stafford okay this one is
seriously heavy like it feels like tins
oh my god I know what this is it's
really boring I ordered some masking
tape because I never I sent a sauce
parcels back I spend ages using
sellotaped like seal them so I ordered
some masking tape of Amazon and that
caught this is very boring I'm not
not in front of you guys variety we've
got a very skinny green envelope another
choice now the envelope let's see what's
in this one okay so this is origins by
all greens foaming deep cleansing mask
or well over some of this with green tea
spirulina and spinach a foaming mask I
don't think I've ever tried a foaming
mask with water that sounds really
lovely I'm such a fan of origins masks
all of them I just absolutely love it as
soon as I try them so I definitely think
this means I'll be having a pamper
evening tonight again I'll be testing
this outfit on my snapchat next is a
quite large and quite heavy box and it
says oh it says it's from L'Oreal so
that's always exciting but I never know
what brand it's from so let's have a
look around my scissors ha I feel so
flustered that to me forever to get into
inside there is a picture of a hand with
hotter tips so let's have a look Oh
looks like a new nail varnish collection
L'Oreal Paris color riche let's have a
little look inside so I have some gold
tissue paper and inside pass the parcel
I have some bubble wrap let's have a
look quartz in here oh wow this is
rather beeps both oh my gosh Wow look at
this it's like a Muji drawers filled
with new nail varnishes from L'Oreal
from their color each collection oh my
gosh
so you've got two drawers we've got the
pinks and reds and then down here
the oh wow look at those colors pinks
and golds and light ups and then some
more kind of earthy tones down here line
ups greens and blues that is so
spectacular what an incredible
collection and some handy drawers to
keep them in as well I always don't want
to take them out of the packaging though
they looks so lovely in that so Thank
You L'Oreal I can't wait to try those I
need to take my nail wanna shop up this
video give them a go next I have a big
box from Croydon not giving too much
away let's have a little look what
here very snazzy box tied up in a
beautiful turquoise ribbon when they've
got to be range see you Josie I'm
delighted in cheese and you've got to be
playful styling primer let's have a look
at this new primer I love trying out new
hair things normally I'm not very
inventive with my hair it's so nice when
there are some new products to play with
so inside we've got some green tissue
paper which I will stash afterwards oh
this is very cute
I've got a little kind of tangle teezer
for brushing the locks oh my gosh and
then a giant lollipop we've got to be on
it but it's so fun okay so I've got some
products in here texturizing putty
sculpting spritz there's a styling
primer I think that's the main kind of
product launch oh one of these fancy
hairdresser combs for sorting out your
parting I'm not going to do it now with
the kind of needle on the end and then
this is made a mess texturizing
hairspray up so you love these hair
sprays I've tried a similar one with
lots got before and then it's also a
little tin in here with styling
essentials let's have a little look
what's in here
although this is so cute that's
literally like what you see at the
hairdressing stations so mines all got
jumbled up in the transit but you've got
these big hairpins little grips tiny
bubbles and some normal hair bubbles all
in this handy little tin so Thank You
Schwarzkopf for a lovely little
selection I'm going to feel like such a
hairdressing pro with all of these
gadgets everywhere next up I have
another package from L'Oreal so another
one of their brands and let's have a
look what's inside this one ok so inside
we have got a new straightforward
time-saving blow dry oil from Shu Mehra
I never know if I'm pronouncing that
right that sounds really good a
time-saving blow dry oil for medium to
take caps pretty much what mine is
so suppleness and shine and softness
were reducing blow-dry time that sounds
like exactly the kind of thing I need
for my hair so I definitely use that
next time I vote
my hair I will keep you updated on
snapchat as to how I get on next up I
have a package from bareMinerals and I'm
such a huge lover of their mineral some
always excited to try some new launches
today I've got so let's see this inside
here but a couple of pieces
this is mattifying a prep gel that
sounds amazing
and their concealer which I think I
tried when I did a little makeup
tutorial on periscope with them but this
sounds lovely let's have a little look
at this primer so inside of a little
tube blame it on blemish remedy I
absolutely love their blemish remedy
pelvis this is obviously from the same
range
oh really kind of milky consistency I
only need a teeny tiny bit no smell to
it which is good or does that very kind
of light scent to this one so I guess
this is like a must find primer which
will just make sure you don't have any
oil coming up on the skin the rest of
the day and then the concealer which i
think is an under eye concealer they
sent me the light shade so we're really
good for those them under eye circles so
it's not what I thought it was going to
be it's actually more like a kind of
crayon I think yeah almost like um those
things which he puts on your eyes those
kind of cool pens but it's a concealer
so a really kind of nice
balmy consistency good for a base before
you put on your foundation I should
think and I'm really excited to open
this one because it says it's from
Betty's which is kind of like a tearooms
up in Yorkshire I went to one of their
events when they did a pop-up in London
last summer so I'm wondering if there's
going to be anything edible in here so
that's having a look inside so we have
another pass the parcel incident let's
see what's in here very carefully
wrapped oh my gosh that is too cute also
they've sent me a little selection of
Easter biscuits you've got a little
bunny rabbit and egg thing that's a
chick and little dove all biscuit so I'm
gonna try one of these now as I said I
feel like I'm a bit
so let's give these the taste test
on my dime mmm there's more so we also
have some frailing praline I never know
how to say it and milk chocolate eggs
which oh my gosh my favorite kind of
chocolate in the world so got a lovely
little cone as well I think that's
everything so thank you very much
Betty's I look forward to devouring
those later on okay I feel like the
camera has moved but maybe I'm just
going mad I think I need to have more to
eat when I finish showing this video so
I just looked up and the camera was in a
different place I'm definitely going mad
so next I have a couple of envelopes I
never normally get envelopes so I wonder
if this is like an event invitation or
something so let's have a little look
watch is inside so we have Bobby Brown
nourishing lip color oil infused shine
not imitation just a very snappy
interest raised from Oliver Bolivar
Bobby Brown nourishing lip color in oil
infused shine so releasing a new
lipstick a lovely red one if you are
going to try out a sample of that next I
have another joy Norma's one so this is
a big and very heavy box from London
fuel power passion energy so let's have
a little look what's inside this one

Wow we have this incredible basket it
looks like it's from palmer's or cocoa
butter range let's have a look inside so
there's a range of products in here from
Palmer's new range which is with manuka
honey which is one of my favorite things
in the whole world to eat

body we've got a finishing hair oil and
I just absolutely love hair oils and
actual manuka honey which is amazing
I'll be sticking that in a smoothie

it's a high brush and then there is a
manuka flower honey nourishing

press release all in this gorgeous
little basket for the lovely treats so
