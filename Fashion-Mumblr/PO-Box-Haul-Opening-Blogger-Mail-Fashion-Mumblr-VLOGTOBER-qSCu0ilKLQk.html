channel thanks so much for joining me
for today's video which is going to be a
pure box blogger mail haul and I have
been promising you this video for so
long in recent vlog Tovar videos so here
it is finally got around to sharing all
of these beautiful things with you you
guys know how bloggers mail works by now
so I'm not going to go into all of that
and but I have been sent summery
beatable things recently and I wanted to
share them with you so first of all I
want to give a huge shout out to bloom
on flowers who sent me this incredible
bunch behind me this is one of the most
unusual bouquets of bunches of flowers
I've ever been sent they're not like as
you can see it's not a normal bunch of
flowers it's really like unusual plants
you've got this long stiff one I'm sorry
I'm really bad with the names of flowers
but they're all on the company's website
this is a really beautiful unusual or
tundle flower selection and if I'm not
correct I believe that this is their
large bunch which is 31 pounds I think
which is so much better than the prices
that you pay on the street vendors I
don't know about where you guys live but
here in London and flowers are so
expensive if I'd have bought that from
someone on the street if I would have
cost me like 15 60 pounds from those
little flower stores so really really
good offering from the bloom on website
so thank you guys have send me those
flowers that was a really lovely treat
for this week and they've also given me
a discount code which I'll put on the
screen now and you can get free hand
blown bars worth 25 pounds if you use
that discount code so a really lovely
service and I'll give all the
information about their website down
below so thank you bloom on flowers my
first wonderful piece of bloggers mail
this week or let's give you guys a shout
out the next thing that I picked up from
my PA box was a misguided order sorry
we whisk through this I don't want to
spend too long going through this
because it's not misguide at all but I
just wanted to show you guys what's
inside anyway so this was the main thing
that I was really really excited about I
think this is around 49 pounds on the
website as always I'll leave the links
to everything down below but this is the
misguided shilling I think they're
called like aviator bomber jackets with
this further sheet
lining and then you've got the buckles
so this always comes in fashion every
single autumn winter these kind of
jackets are always in styles I thought I
would get one in this blush color
because everyone has them in black or
white or sand color but as you guys know
this blush shade is really really me so
I thought I would try it out in this
color the sheep skin or sheep fur goes
all the way through the lining is this
can be really snuggly and warm and I
feel like this is the kind of jacket
that you can just stick on there was so
many different outfits so yeah that was
like the main inspiration behind this
misguided haul I did also want to pick
up another style of jacket something a
little bit more classic so I went for
this one which is like a light sand
color and it's quite a long style jacket
this will fall just between me and my
thigh I guess which is a really nice
length for keeping warm keeping the wind
chill off you and this color is really
plastic so hopefully this will be a
really easy one to wear and will go with
so many outfits I really like the zip is
on the side as well I think that's just
a nice unusual design detail so this is
getting more of a classic style and yeah
just really nice one for me to try from
misguided then we have another jacket as
you can tell it's definitely getting to
that time of year where I'm looking to
invest in some winter jackets this one
again is a blush color but more of a
simple shape so this is quite a classic
style a classic shape it's gonna be
quite a boxy silhouette but you've got
this really smart collar this very
formal collar detail I just wear this
open so you can see my knitwear
underneath and once again that just
absolutely even love this color so
that's my third and final jacket
purchase from misguided
I also spotted this dress and as
as I saw the material I thought it
looked so much like the Gucci designs
that we saw in the autumn/winter
collection so yeah I definitely pick
this up to be a Gucci s look I think if
I wear this with some nice black boots
maybe my mango ones which you guys have
seen me wearing tons recently I think
that's gonna look incredibly stylish and
I've also been looking out for autumn
dresses because I feel like an autumn
dress with black tights and black boots
it's like an instant outfit you really
don't need to think about it so
hopefully this will be one of those it's
got the material is actually really
really lovely nicer than I was expecting
the floral details are kind of velvety
but the sheer overlay and then you've
got a very high neck so really beautiful
design looking forward to giving this a
try
and I think this is gonna be one of
those pieces that I wear over and over
and over again during autumn because
it's kind of one of those no-brainer
outfits I really think misguided has
stepped up their game recently because I
couldn't believe it when I saw this
beautiful design on there I think it's
kind of thing you'd expect to buy from
self-portrait and not from misguided so
I'm really really pleased with this one
it is a burgundy it's actually more of
an earthy color than it's coming up on
the screen it's a little bit darker I'll
leave the pictures from the website on
the screens you can see how they look on
the model you can see it's got this
beautiful pleated material this ruffle
detail I think is what makes it look so
expensive and so high-end and then the
ruffle detail is continued down onto the
sleeves so they're really ticking at so
many trends boxes with this I'm so
excited to try this I think this is
going to be one of those pieces are
really just jazzes of a pair of jeans
really lovely to wear for potentially
festive dinners or any dinner parties we
might have over the autumn period
looking forward to trying this out and
I'm predicting you guys going to see me
wearing this a lot in upcoming vlogs so
keep an eye out for that one next thing
in a my misguided bag is this pair of
pale pink and white striped pajamas and
as soon as I saw these I thought they're
really good tube of the Victoria's
Secret pajamas and also I just really
like this material because it feels
so light and silky and yet it's not silk
so it doesn't crease really badly and
it's not like a crazy ridiculous price
tag so I've got this short and the
allows I think the set was under 30
pounds whereas I feel like the
Victoria's Secret one it's like 80
pounds so actually ridiculous pink and
white stripes in bed just so cute so
girly and you could wear them as
separate so you know you could wear the
blouse on its own or you could wear like
a little white freely talk with the
shorts but yeah really really good do
you before the Victoria Secret ones and
even if you don't care about Victoria
Secret ones are still a really adorable
pajama style and they look so cute and
comfy so I can't wait to give those a
try and probably um to bed tonight so
check my daily vlogs out and then the
last thing in my misguided bag is this
beautiful embroidered skirt once again
this looks so high-end I can't believe
that misguided I've got all these
beautiful pieces in at the moment I feel
like they are just going up so much in
my opinion recently I never used to
really shop for them that much but
recently they have been seriously
impressing me this has got beautiful
embroidered detail then you've got this
like and I don't know we call that just
squiggly dee feather on the edges you've
got these embellishments they're like
little studs and I feel like it's quite
a good length as well it's not too short
but I'll definitely be wearing this as
black tights like a white blouse tucked
in and black booties so really really
impressed with those lovely pieces from
misguided the next thing that was in my
pierre box is also from a fashion
retailer but actually what's in here is
not for me cuz i can see our eye dog
written on the box
so this is actually blogger mail for
dexter who is currently rummaging around
in amongst the packaging right now but
yeah so river island i couldn't believe
it the other day i went on their website
and it's like
women dogs so they have a whole new
section for dogs so they decide it's
very kindly sent me over a jumper for
Dexter so let's have a little look and
see what it's like so they've put in a
little note it says we hope Dexter
enjoys wearing our new fashioned doggy
range love River Island PR and then
there's a little press release as well
inside Dexter this is so cute
it may be pink but Dexter won't really
know will he and I like pink so hey ho
this looks absolutely adorable for him
and it's so nice to keep them a little
bit more more warm and snuggly now
there's getting a bit cooler it's got
little arm holes or his little legs it
looks like it's nice and long as well so
perfect for little sausage dogs and then
you've got the ri dog logo on there so
keep an eye on Dex and Instagram I'll
leave on the screen now and you'll
probably be seeing seeing these in
action and then this is absolutely
adorable this is a little doggie
Christmas jumper this one doesn't have
arm holes like she needs but it does
have little holes where his little legs
can come through once again nice and
long with this cute little roll neck
he's going so snuggly and warm in there
and then you've got this beautiful feral
print I wish they made a human version
of this so that you can match your dog
river and if you make a human version
then let me know because me Dex from
Charley all wearing matching Christmas
jumpers will just be so cute cannot wait
to dress Dexter up in those so they're
the only fashion pieces and fashion
human and dog that I've been sent
recently next is I think something from
a beauty brand I did have a quick peek
in here oh yeah so this arrived I keep
saying Pierre box you know you might use
toddle which is just much more
convenient to me and she first this
arrived to my shuttle and by the look of
it it is from Carmex and a Halloween
edition have a lip tingling Halloween Oh
deleted tingling ones and so they put in
a box that says the trick and also a box
that says greet so I'm guessing the
treat one that might be their normal
style oh and there's the Halloween candy
perfect timing because I'm filming
on the day you guys are seeing it so
it's our Halloween party tonight they've
put in a load of scary candy Jolly
Rancher lollipop caramel apple and then
their classic lip balm which is just the
best lip bar if you have sore lips dry
lips you really can't eat comics I just
absolutely love it and then I'm
intrigued to see what's in the trick
sorry that was a treat box I'm intrigued
to see what's in the trick box oh so we
just have the cold sores comics original
formula okay so it's not lip tingling I
don't know if they pull out like a
pouncing one maybe they put it in the
trick box because if you have a cold so
it's not very nice but yeah this is just
that classic in pop lip balm I prefer
the squeegee tube because I don't like
getting this under my nails but I know
that Charlie loves this so I will give
him a little comics treat for me
Halloween then I have another bag this
one says Garnier on it so no surprises
whoo this is coming from and it looks
like they've also put in some Halloween
treats I've never actually received
welcoming off from carny before so it's
nice to know that I'm on their radar now
hello Gagne thank you for having me to
your blogger list and inside is a topper
of the Garnier micellar oil infused
woods I'm actually using this at the
moment as my everyday might of the water
really really enjoying it it leaves my
skin feeling nice and hydrated and roast
some way so the waters can dry them out
a bit you obviously have to shake it up
and then it blends the to the oil and
the liquids they all blend into one so
yeah really been enjoying using this
recently sorry that rustling Dexter is
on the move and then they also put in
their most of the oil infused cleansing
wipes haven't tried these
but series I love the mice little water
has so much I think I'll get along with
them really well all those Halloween
treats but it's so cute again perfect
timing
these are some little pumpkin
marshmallows as absolutely adorable
I'll definitely be snacking on those
later and then finally a moisture bomb
at tissue mask
actually you may recognize this and the
oil micellar water from when Charlie and
I did
at all and try to use this I didn't get
a chance to but um I have actually just
found out and I'm going to Abu Dhabi
next week on the seventh so I will
definitely be taking this on the
airplane with me because for 15 minutes
stick it on your face take it off and
then tap the cerumen so so so amide
rating so really good one for flying and
this is a really affordable tissue mask
as well so thank you Barney eight and
then I can also see they put in a pair
of ghost glasses this is so funny let me
put the bag down this is absolutely
brilliant so thank you Garnier my
Halloween is higher and I think that's
everything in that yeah I've just some
tissue paper so lovely Halloween
inspired beauty gifts from Garnier I
honestly cannot recommend this stuff
enough I'm about halfway through mine at
the moment and I actually prefer it to
its dropping face right for a new place
I actually prefer it to more expensive
Mitel waters that I've tried my skin
just seems to absolutely love oil so
yeah thank you very much going in I'm
very pleased to have a replacement when
this runs out should I keep these on or
not I kind of like them and I know that
I've got advice today so maybe these are
distracting from my eye bags next I have
a massive Jo Malone bag but certainly
what's inside is actually not from
Germany and I just used it for carrying
but what is inside does look incredibly
exciting so I have a bag within a bag
this is from zoeva and it looks like
they've sent a massive box within this
bag this really is like pass the parcel
so let me just untangle this and we can
see what's in the box
this is insane Wow okay so the box says
zoeva makeup artist zoe bag I'm so
intrigued so let's have a little look
what is inside the box my gosh it's
almost as though it's like a designer
handbag the way that it's come in its
own
by I mean I take these off I couldn't
even take myself seriously in those okay
so you have the dustbag feels quite
heavy let's see what's inside oh my god
oh my good heavens this is insane guys I
have always wanted like a proper makeup
bag because as you can imagine my makeup
collection is quite large and when I
travel I want to take a little bit with
me
this is a zoeva makeup bag in this
beautiful it's the same not sure if it's
real leather I think so we were a very
animal friendly so I'm guessing it's not
real leather but the same kind of design
as their very first rose gold and makeup
brush collection so if you've got that
pouch this is the same kind of material
and then at the top here I can see that
there are three sections separated out
with rose gold zips which is just and
you can imagine them very exciting for
me so let's start at the back I'm going
to open up the back section makes a wash
so Wow so this is obviously where your
tools go you've got all of these
sections for brushes guys I can't
believe how exciting this is and you've
got a clear pouch here which might be
really good for makeup wipes or cotton
pads and things like that three clear
pouches you can just put your bits and
bobs in there it's quite slim things and
then opening up the middle section oh my
god guys though either have totally
spoil me oh my god this is absolutely
insane you guys know what a fan I have
observed brushes like I recommend them
above everything else like they are the
best quality the best value I love them
to pieces so this is just absolutely
incredible for me I think I do have a
fair few of these but as the brown and
gold set was the first one that I got
they're all very battered because I do
use them so much that this looks like
there must be at least 20 brushes in
here blows I don't even have by wonder
if this is like a new exclusive kit and
then
inside the bag you've got this humongous
section for keeping all your makeup in
there are little elastic bits so you can
make sure that your products don't go
flying around all over the place oh my
gosh this is just absolutely like any
beauty lover's dream if you guys are as
excited by this as I are I leave a link
down below maybe add it to a Christmas
list so I think this is probably gonna
be quite expensive especially if it does
come with the brushes
I mean zoeva is the best value for money
like imagine if you were to get for
Bobby Brown or Mac brush that that would
set you back like a few hundred pounds
and then this section is obviously for
your products you've got this big um
like clear compartment here you can put
like mascaras and lip glosses in and
then this last compartment is mesh and
of course all separated out by the rose
gold
zips oh my god I can't believe that this
is mine this is gonna get so so so much
use all my travels and like just storing
everything makeup in this is absolutely
stunning so Eva if you're watching I'm
so grateful thank you so much and the
brushes on top that is just absolutely
insane so so I just read the little
press release from the PR company the
look after zoeva and they said that it's
a little something from zoeva to thank
you for your continued support that is
so kind just love it that is just so so
generous the Zoe bag launches on
November the 14th so you guys have got
two weeks to wait and honestly I feel
like this will probably sell out so yeah
keep a lookout on November the 14th
I'm just flicking through here to see if
it has a price on it oh my gosh all
these photos are so stunning I think by
the looks of it you can also get the
pinky rose gold version as well which
has got all the rose gold and brushes in
you know the pink and gold ones which is
just equal is beautiful okay so actually
there is a makeup bag for every zoeva
brush collection is a rose golden one
rose golden volume 2 and rose gold and
volume 3 so gosh there's just so many to
choose from I actually want all of them
I can't find where it
how much it costs I'm sorry guys I
cannot see where it says the price but
if I was to guess with the amount of
brushes that you get and the bag I don't
know I think this would probably be like
180 pounds ish maybe like 200 pounds I'm
not sure but either way the amount of
brushes that you're getting in there and
makeup bags are expensive especially
like professional ones like that so
either way as it's from zoeva it'll be
pretty much the best value you can get
and I hand on heart recommend zu your
brushes so much so yeah those are so
exciting and I bet that's gonna be on so
many Christmas wishlist this year if
it's not them
yeah put it on your wish list cos so
it's my next parcel is actually already
come undone um but it's in this very
sparkly looking bad I feel like
nothing's gonna top that definitely
should have saved that one till last but
this one okay this one is from urban
decay so it could come up pretty close
but inside it looks like we've got some
new wood launches let's have a little
look new treats from urban decay this is
their naked illuminated trio and it
comes in this beautiful box which is
kind of like a golden marble style
really really cute I just love urban
decay's habits so much so yeah urban
naked illuminating trio alrighty so
inside we have got these three beautiful
looking powders are like dome shaped
powders which I just find really
satisfying it feels like they're gonna
last forever cause so much product that
this one is very golden really shimmery
and then this middle one is a little bit
less sugary a bit more bronzy and then
you've got a really beautiful peach
toned one so I guess you can use these
as just really lovely ways to add a bit
of a glow bit of shimmer to your face as
highlight as contour just like the nice
sparkly powder and then this brush looks
really unusual normally I don't like
the brushes that come with pallets but
this one looks like a really good one
for just adding a touch of shimmer
cheekbones contour ring so every useful
brush shape I also just sing this
palette looks absolutely beautiful I
really like this it does look like a
sanding marble color which is just
absolutely stunning um it doesn't it
says face and body power there okay so
you could always add it to your
collarbone to add a little bit of
shimmer to that area as well looking for
the festive season so thank you over
decay that looks absolutely beautiful
also inside that palette were three
liquid moon dust eyeshadow is these
sound rather intriguing so open up want
to show you guys moon dust I have their
eyeshadow palette so I'm intrigued to
see what the liquid ones look like oh my
gosh so it almost looks like a lip gloss
this one is a almost like a burnt pink
color oh wow
and then the applicator looks a little
bit like an eyeliner oh my gosh nice
such intense color payoff can you see
that that's absolutely beautiful gosh I
always really struggled to get sparkly
eyeshadow to look sparkly on my eye
it always looks lovely when I swatch it
but I feel like these will just be so
shimmery so I'm looking forward to
giving those a try keep a lookout on my
snapchat and also on the blog if you
want to see more on all these products
and I do actually have a few more pieces
but I'm gonna stop there because I don't

stuff to do today we've got to decorate
