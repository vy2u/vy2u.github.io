me for today's video which is another
haul as part of fashion model a whole
week I really hope you guys are enjoying
all of my hauls this week not gonna lie
this one is probably my favorite it is
the premium and higher-end
slash investment pieces haul so
obviously kind of not really a whole
because I didn't go out and buy all
these pieces at once sadly I do not have
the funds to do that instead I've kind
of been picking these pieces up over the
past few weeks
and when I say premium high-street I
mean those stores that are not quite
High Street not quite designer and it's
brands such as Reese Karen Millen Ted
Baker Club Monaco those kind of brands
and they are the retailers that I go to
for my investment pieces and my almost
my essentials and my basics for each
season I actually did this exact video
last year autumn investment pieces I'll
leave it linked up here if you want to
see what's changed a lot of the
retailers are very similar and the
pieces so I picked up last year I have
no regrets for any of those I wore them
all so so much so fingers crossed the
same will apply this year because I do
get so much wear out of them I'm more
than happy to invest a little bit more
in these pieces to ensure that I get
that quality and I know that I'll wear
them absolutely loads so without further
ado I'm gonna get started with the piece
so I'm wearing it now so this I actually
only bought yesterday so that's kind of
why I'm wearing it now I didn't invite
you but when I buy something I just want
to wear it straight away this is a
beautiful cashmere and wool Cape wrap
from Club Monaco and I seem to have on
wonky there we go so yeah it's a
beautiful gray cashmere wool blend wrap
from Club Monaco picked this up
yesterday from the Sloane Street or a
Sloane Square store which I love it's
interior girls in there and this is just
a beautiful very luxurious looking and
feeling very casual piece it's the kind
of piece that we're probably out to a
few meetings on more casual days dress
down Friday and just know that when I
wear it I feel and look
relaxed but also polished at the same
time if that makes sense because it does
have such a beautiful drape to it you
can tell it is a more premium piece just
the way that it's cut and of course the
quality of the material I absolutely
adore this gray color it's a little bit
speckled a little bit more like and then
on the inside as you can see it's white
so you could actually flip this round
and write as a white cape if you so
preferred it's got this little bow
detail on the sleeves but that is the
only design detail apart from that it
really is just a square of wool I could
probably buy a square of cashmere and
make this myself in fact that's not a
bad idea I might try and get some like
squares of different colored cashmere
maybe camel colored and DIY this let me
know if you'd like to see a video on
that that's a southern light bulb moment
but yeah a real piece of this piece from
Club Monaco it was not cheap but I'm
determined to get a lot of price per
wear out of this next up is a real
investment piece but I couldn't resist
this beautiful bag to be my autumn
handbag it is the YSL sunset bag in this
crocodile effects leather and in a gray
color which is very different for me I
do not own any great handbags most of my
bags are pink or brown but I thought
this was just absolutely beautiful and a
really nice transition color from spring
summer to autumn winter so the kind of
bag I can wear all year round I got this
from net-a-porter and I just have worn
it non-stop ever since I probably
wouldn't wear it with this maybe slight
gray overload I'm not too sure but I
love the length of the strap it's got
this chain strap with a little leather
section here so I can pop it over my
shoulder pocket in the back which comes
in very handy for Oyster cards umm and I
haven't like prepared this for this
video or anything but there are three
sections inside a little pocket which
I've got a taxi receipt and kind of a
main pocket oh there's my ID I thought
I'd lost that couple of lipsticks
invisible lip liner and then a little a
little envelope pocket down at the back
there and then you've got this magnetic
clasp in the middle so absolutely adore
this beautiful investment piece
it was around 1500 pounds and I've
already worn it so much that the price
per wear is already coming down again
but this is my handbag splurge for
autumn season while we're talking about
net-a-porter I have to also mention
might be useful
new Gucci mules I have been thinking
about these pretty much since last year
I never knew which color I was going to
go for and then I thought you know what
I just want to go for something really
stand out really bold because there are
so many coops around and as much as I'm
a huge fan of dupes you guys know I made
a whole video about dupes I wanted
something to be really really special so
decided to go for these animal printed
ones and the amount of compliments that
I have received on these is on real I
wear them so so so much I did find them
a little bit slippy to begin with the
soles are quite slippy so I still may go
to a cobbler and get them gripper fide
and get some grit put on them but I
haven't found it to be too much of a
problem
I got size 36 which is my usual size and
they fit me perfectly and they are this
kind of pony skin effect which I just
think is absolutely beautiful and no
doubt you'll be seeing me wearing these
throughout the rest of the season so
these next three pieces from this
reporter I only ordered very recently
and I'm not sure which if any I'm going
to keep so this is where I could
definitely do with some words of wisdom
from you guys first of all is the Chloe
Susannah boots in this brownie topi
almost grey shade and they are suede
material which doesn't bother me too
much if it's going to rain
I always check the forecast I just
wouldn't buy them out plus I have so
much trust in suede protective spray
I've had so many boots that I've worn in
the rain and I've gone back to their
brand new self just because of suede
protector sprays I'm not too worried
about that they have got the beautiful
gold studs over them and then this
buckle detail I just need to make sure
that I know I'm going to get so much use
out of these I think I would probably
get more use out of these and the black
ones because they just fit with the
color of my wardrobe more I've been
wearing around the house and they are
very comfortable but still have not
totally made my mind up just yet so let
me know your opinion the other option
which is still in its box is the Chloe
Susannah boots in black so let's open
this up again I so these also were from
a net supporter I have to say it's kind
of like don't if you can see what it's
buckled in a little bit almost as though
the leather it doesn't have quite enough
padding in it I'd have thought there'd
be some padding in there they also look
quite big these are 36 the same size as
the brown ones they just look a bit
bigger so I'm going to try this pair and
his power the few different outfits
before I make up my mind these are
leather so potentially a bit more hard
wearing but if any of you guys have got
the Khloe Susannah boots and please let
me know your opinions on them because
obviously they are expensive than any a
thousand pound of hair so I want to make
sure that I really invest wisely and get
a pair of boots oh I know I'm going to
wear so so so much all right you're
going to think I'm crazy but I ordered
three pairs of Cloe boots in my net
support a haul these are actually seed
by Chloe's though they are a lower
pricepoint and they're a bit of a wild
card so again I'd be very interested to
hear your opinion love this little dust
bag alright so here's the boot as you
can see very different to the Susanna
style and not really that obvious at
their Chloe at all I think these are
around 275 pounds so a much lower price
point than the Susanna boots they are
very practical they've got a mega sole
like real proper workman's grip here and
then a very squishy you know that kind
of rubber material and grippy heel as
well so you've got the grip great if
it's icy but you still get the heights
and the glamour of a Chloe Boot lace up
at the front and then you've got this
darker leather and around the back of
the shoe I think that absolutely
gorgeous and imagine just like rocking
up to a polo game or a rugby match
wearing these you would absolutely look
amazing I'm trying to think my chances
I'd wear them with probably white skinny
jeans would look awesome or it could be
a really nice way of adding a little bit
of interest to a maxi dress a really
cool like boho style that's very Kate
Moss around with something like this but
yeah I just was really attracted to
these on the website definitely going to
try them with a few outfit options so
let me know your opinion on my wild card
purchase all right so I'm going to go
back to the high street now those are my
designer purchases I'm next going to
show you the bits and bobs that I have
picked up recently from Reese which is
one of my favorite retailers these
pieces are very much transition so I
have been wearing them in these last few
weeks of summer that I know that I'll
get a lot of use at them in autumn as
well seeing as were on a roll with shoes
I'll start off with these so I picked up
these pointed toe gray suede flats I
just think they're so beautiful I adore
a pointed toe I think it's very elegant
and there's color I think is very very
versatile I've already worn these loads
find them very comfortable this big band
means they really don't budge when
they're on your feet which is great and
I find that a pointed toe really
elongates the legs so I see love those
they look great with jeans with skirts
with dresses so many outfit options so I
know that I'll get tons of use out of
these in the coming weeks and months and
then this is probably one of my first
real basic clothing items that you know
you just have them in your wardrobe and
they're the kind of pieces that you
reach for over and over again no matter
what time of year it's a very classic
design plain t-shirt but the material is
this really lovely stripe which just
adds a lovely design element to it and
the way that it hangs when it's on it's
really beautifully structured because of
this slightly thicker material so it
does have a really lovely polished look
to it so far luminous with a high
waisted mom jeans and I've also worn
this tucked into a high-waisted midi
skirt both looked absolutely beautiful
and yes it was a little bit more
expensive than your average t-shirt but
price per wear I think this is going to
do really really well and it's just a
classic piece of classic wardrobe piece
everyone needs a slightly more luxurious
white t-shirt in their wardrobe and for
me this is exactly that next up and you
guys may have spotted this already on my
Instagram every time I feature it it
gets so many questions it is this pink
metallic knit top with a crossover from
Reese I just think this color is so
beautiful it has got metallic stitching
going through it which gives it a little
bit of a festive vibe but this pastel
color makes it very wearable for this
time of year as well the neckline I
think makes us look so elegant
I love teaming it with my Astrid mu
lariat necklace which has a moon and
then drops into the cleavage area just
looks so beautiful with this jumper it's
also great for those days when you're
not too sure what the weather's going to
be like because keeps you warm but not
too hot so a really lovely transitional
piece that already I have worn loads and
then an even more simple t-shirts from
recess is just a plain white t-shirt
with a little bit of reinforcement
around the collar just to give it a
little bit of a design detail I have
quite a few Reese - shirts in my
collection and they wear so well there's
nothing was investing the t-shirt and
then finding it goes bubbly or loses its
shape I've never found that with the
Reese ones I've always been so impressed
quality so I thought I'd add another
essential item into my autumn wardrobe
this one I tried on in the store and
apps that you fell in love with it it's
this beautiful silky material I call
this like a vicar collar because it's
quite a high-neck definitely reminds me
of like a priest or something and then
this beautiful mine's actually I'm done
there we go with this beautiful keyhole
detail in the back which is a lovely
detail the material is a beautiful silky
soft blush pink and it hangs in the most
lovely way you can definitely tell it is
more of an investment piece this is a
lovely way to dress up white jeans or
you could wear again sucked into a midi
skirt so many ways to wear this and also
it look great cinched in with a waist
belt as well
essentially waist is one of the trends
are going to be seeing a lot in the
upcoming season and I did a video on
Sunday all about autumn winter trends
which ones to look out for so click up
here if you want to catch that video
I've mentioned a midi skirt a few times
now and the one that I picked up is this
beautiful pleated midi skirt again from
reese in this gorgeous lush I'd say it's
almost like a memo of color it's
definitely moving slightly away from
lush pink more into like a blush battle
but again the way that this hangs is
just absolutely beautiful when you spin
when you twirl and you move it just has
the most beautiful flow to the fabric
which i think is the main point of
difference between this and more
affordable versions I've worn this with
a slouchy knit with my white jumper I'm
about to show you and it's probably one
of my favorite current outfits it's a
go-to outfit warm and yet you feel
stylish you look great and it's just a
very timeless look but also very
on-trend and this is the knits that I've
been mentioning I have already worn this
absolutely loads I find it's so
versatile it's a kind of piece that you
wear so much this time of year going
into autumn winter you could definitely
put like a thermal on underneath this
it's got the Sun going through it at the
moment making it look quite sheer but
when it is against the body you can't
see any undergarments so don't need to
worry about its Sheerness I also really
like the sleeves on this because they go
down and have quite a long cuff which
means you can really show off your
bracelets or jewelry which I really like
I think it just adds a really lovely
touch to it the neckline is quite long
and narrow which again is really
feminine really delicate looks great
with a really simple necklace like
that I'm wearing now would look really
nice with something like this yeah I can
tell the price per wear for this is
going to go right down as I get more and
more use out of it in autumn the next
retailer in this hall is Ted Baker and
these pieces I haven't actually worn
quite so much yet because they are very
autumnal in fact most of these I haven't
worn at all yet when I went into the
store I went to the Regent Street store
I really had it in my head that I didn't
want to buy any more white pieces and he
will spring some of its but really
invest in autumn it was a very gray and
rainy day so I had autumn vibes going on
that day
first thing that I picked up was this
burgundy dress I adore Ted Baker dresses
I really love wearing on special
occasions and this one I thought would
be beautiful for any autumnal or wintry
dinner parties I may have coming up
doing crazy things the camera lighting
so I'll swiftly go through this one but
it's a very elasticated material which
means the fit is beautiful accentuated
on the waist slightly more cap sleeves
and then you've got this beautiful flare
detail on the skirt at hangs absolutely
gorgeously there's a laser effect cut
out on the bottom here so the light goes
through which is a really beautiful
design detail and then as you'd expect
with Ted Baker you've got this beautiful
rose gold zip which I think is just so
beautiful as beautiful as a zip can be
I'm really looking forward to wearing
this for upcoming dinner parties
upcoming evening events but this color
is a little bit toward terminal to start
wearing yet so it's one that's gonna
stain my wardrobe and very very excited
to wear this one next and probably one
of the favourite pieces that I picked up
from Ted Baker is this gorgeous puffer
jacket I chose this pearly gray shade
because I thought it'd be the most
versatile with all my autumn winter
outfits it's almost a pastel color
almost the same color as my bag but I
just think it's absolutely stunning so
so warms it has got this beautiful
padding in it and then you've got this
beautiful faux fur neckline which just
gives it such a luxe look and really
really cozy and warm as well so again
cannot wait to start wearing this also
with the accentuated waist trend it does
have an elasticated waist belt
it doesn't actually fasten as tight as I
want it to so I think I'm actually gonna
make the belts a little bit smaller just
make a little tuck in the back so that
it really does pull in at the waist but
you'll be seeing me wearing this
absolutely loads and I'm excited just
start wearing it another dark colored
dress and this is a very practical one
for me it is a navy chef dress really
great if you want to
a little bit smarter for the office
perhaps but it does have this lovely
design detail of a bow or not if I can
just do it up again accentuating the
waste that autumn went to trend that
we're going to be seeing a lot of and
then it just gives you the most
beautiful silhouette it's quite a thick
wall material with a lining so great for
chillier days you could events with
tights and boots or you could just wear
it with stilettos if you wanted to dress
it up a little bit with very practical
piece that I know I'll get tons of use
from and then a couple of more casual
pieces from a tech Baker
I loved her baking it where I find it's
such great quality the coat hanger is
not doing this one any favors but it is
a cream-colored knit with beautiful pie
crust frill detail on the sleeves and on
the neckline it's almost like a
beautiful polo neck also on the frilly
boots metallic stitching which is just a
very pretty design detail which I love
and this in the colder months will be a
great layering piece especially under AG
lay even under another jumper this
collar will just stand out and
completely revamp your knitwear for the
autumn season and then this is even more
casual again it as a plain gray cardigan
but the surprises on the back with this
beautiful floral silk detail so it's
just so nice to have a cozy piece that
is just a little bit different and more
special so I thought I would wear that
one a lot last but absolutely not least
from Ted Baker is my new winter coat
purchase I couldn't resist this I
actually have something very similar to
this from Ted Baker on my wish list last
year but I missed out so I thought I
would get in there early this year it is
this wool and cashmere blend coat in
this gorgeous gray material with the
pink lining which I just think is so
stunning pulls in at the waist and just
can't even explain how beautiful this
looks when you try it on it's such a
classic and stylish design rose gold
design details I just adore it and it's
gonna be so warm and very excited for
this to be my go-to winter coat one
thing I wanted to mention before I move
on to the last retailer that I've hauled
from is this bag so this was actually a
very kind blog mail gift it was sent to
me by Bronco teddy Maximus definitely it
has Emma's bag vibes about it but I just
think some beautiful color and very
practical size as well you can hook it
over your arm fill it with all your bits
and bobs and I think it looks so
stunning price-wise these are more
affordable than designer bags but just a
little bit more expensive
then maybe premium high street bags
somewhere in the middle the quality of
this is absolutely gorgeous
and such practical size that should
we've seen this in a lot of my upcoming
outfits of the day so I thought I'd give
that a quick shout out so thank you very
much teddy Maximus for your extreme
generosity I just looked in the mirror
and I saw that my cape had managed to
spin like 90 degrees round so if that
was really bothering you I'm very sorry
I have adjusted it now so the final
retailer for this haul is Karen Millen
and you guys are gonna be so proud of me
for this because it's not pink it's
black it's a black leather jacket which
I never thought that I would hear myself
saying or admitting to have because just
not really a black leather jacket kind
of person but I was out having some
drinks and my friends Vicki recently and
we thought it'd be hilarious to swap
jackets I was actually wearing this one
and she was wearing a really cool I
think hoses AllSaints black leather
jacket we're like oh my god let's just
swap jackets cuz we don't normally wear
these colors tried on her jacket and I
fell in love and I thought I have to get
myself a black leather jacket so here it
is I'm so excited to wear this I think
it's so cool for me I went for a really
simple kind of an essential piece from
Karen Millen it's not got any crazy
design details it's just exactly what
you want in a classic black leather
jacket a really lovely feminine shape
it's got a little bit of a kick out at
the bottom zip goes up one side you've
got a few pockets yellow gold hardware a
nice little chain for hanging it up and
most importantly the leather is so soft
and buttery and it fits absolutely
beautifully so I'm really excited to
style this up if you guys have any tips
on how to style black leather jackets
and please let me know because I am a
newbie this one again is brand new I
have not had a chance to wear this yet
but it's another essential piece that I
know that I'll get so much wear out of
it'd be really great for a work wardrobe
as well it is this white knitted tank
top so if you've got this beautiful
cutout detail here which just adds a
really nice touch of interest but
because it is this knitted material it
fits the body absolutely beautifully and
the piece that I bought just style it
with is a black leather skirt I know
this is totally revolutionary for me but
I'm trying to be cool I'm trying to be
sophisticated and I thought this was
absolutely beautiful similarly to the
bag it does have
kind of crocodile effect to it which i
think is absolutely gorgeous and it does
come down to a MIDI length so really
beautiful length as well I think if you
have an office job this would just be
the most stylish work combination and
personally I think I'll wear this 20
meetings that I have any slightly more
smart meetings things like that I'm very
excited to just start up my wardrobe in
a slightly more chic way so those are
the pieces that I have treated myself to
recently I really enjoy showing you guys
all these bits and bobs and I'm so
excited to wear them and continue
wearing them so many lovely pieces I'm
very very happy with the base that I
have now for my autumn wardrobe so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this if you
