part of the fashion month of spring edit
I was actually not planning on doing
this video but I had a delivery today
and it inspired me to do a premium high
street haul as part of the fashion
members spring edit if you're not sure
what I'm talking about well is this
whole spring edit thing she's going on
about well basically this week I have
been injecting loads of spring style
content onto my YouTube channel
we've had so many spring fashion videos
already including a video all about
transitioning your wardrobe from winter
to spring it's a bit of a kind of clear
out and organizational wardrobe video
very satisfying we've also had a zara
haul so far and a video all about my 10
wardrobe essentials my kind of spring
basics which are really the foundation
pieces for building a fantastic spring
wardrobe so any of the videos that you
may have missed I'll leave them linked
down below and once the spring edit is
complete you'll find a full list of my
spring edit videos linked in the
description box so just click show more
for all the information you need so
today as I mentioned there's going to be
a premium high street haul and now for
me the definition of premium high street
is kind of that level that's not quite
designer and not quite high street so
it's not Topshop River Island and it's
not net-a-porter Gucci Fendi it's that
really nice kind of in-between level and
to be honest it is my favorite category
if you will to shop in because I feel
like you're getting beautiful quality
you're getting really timeless pieces
investment pieces and yet you're not
paying through the nose for a designer
price tag the things that I buy from the
premium end of the high street often
last me years I was when I was going
through my wardrobe and you'll see me
talking about this I was pulling out
pieces that I invested in years two
three years ago but still I absolutely
adore because they are made so
beautifully the craftsmanship is
absolutely gorgeous and so the price per
wear is right down there so yes they're
more expensive than like the top shops
the new looks that kind of thing but I
get so much use out of them and I think
that by shopping from the premium end of
the high street it's really investing in
your entire wardrobe a lot of these
pieces are very classic they really work
with so many different outfit
combinations and I think the quality
really does show and it helps to
your entire outfit your entire wardrobe
look a whole lot more expensive and I'm
definitely at that stage of life that
makes me sound really old but I'm
definitely at the point where I do want
to invest a little bit more in the kind
of more classic pieces that I wear time
and time again so without further ado my
favorite Premium High Street retailers
include Rhys Ted Baker Karen Millen
coast they're the ones that I go to the
most often today I'm featuring most of
those that aren't any Rhys pieces in
here because I did do a bit of a Rhys
whole not too long ago so if you'd like
to see what I got from there and I would
highly recommend watching it there so
many amazing pieces and check out my
what's new in my wardrobe video you'll
see lots of lovely things including this
pleated skirt for example which is a
real favorite in my wardrobe this lace
top was another one another piece from
Rhys and then there's also some things
from a French Connection in that video
today I'm gonna start off with Ted Baker
so I've been lusting over a few things
from Ted Baker since I visited the
concession in Selfridges on Mother's Day
or kind of pretend Mother's Day there
were so many dreamy pieces in there I
think that Ted Baker really gets my
style a lot of other things are very
feminine but also still very classic and
timeless so yeah lots of bits in there
on my wish list at the moment the pieces
that I've gone for firstly this handbag
I could not resist this I really love
crossbody bag in fact you will know if
you watched yesterday's video that
crossbody bags are one of my 10 that
spring essentials this I thought was
just the perfect size this will fit all
of my daily essentials in their
color wise it's dreamy it's rose gold
kind of a pinky hue to it which means
it'll go with all of my wardrobe
obviously my color palette is very pink
it's got pearls on the front and I love
pearls and it can be worn as a clutch
bag you can wear it this way around or a
little bit more plain this way around
and then of course it does have a chain
strap inside it how many one pulled it
out yet so this detachable look chain
strap and then you do have another
section on the top which means it is
more comfortable to wear on your arm
price tag this is 159 pounds so it's not
a real sudden impulse buy from the high
street but the quality is that of a
luxury bag the way that Ted bag things
are made the materials they use is
so beautiful I would say the same
quality as a Gucci bag of the style a
Prada bag of the style of Fendi even and
yet you're not paying even a fraction of
the price of those bags so that's the
first thing that I treated myself to
from a Ted Baker this is a bit more of a
statement piece but I thought it was so
fabulous I could not resist it and is
this silky bomber with this beautiful
floral applique it's got a rose gold zip
very iconic off Ted Baker I just love
all their rose gold details and I mean
it's just so so gorgeous I find that I
often struggle to pull together casual
outfits that still really represent my
personal style so I thought on days and
I do want to be more casual but I
definitely still want to be really
feminine and have a bit of a luxury
touch this would be the perfect thing
for that inside you've got the really
fun that Ted Baker lining all of Ted
Baker things always have the most
amazing lining it's always such a fun
surprise seeing what kind of pattern is
in the lining even in the men's things
like the suits will have they'll have
like tractors or fish or flamingos in
the lining so so fun and then it's got
these little slip pockets as well which
is a design detail that I absolutely
love I'm really looking forward to
starting this up I think it's gonna be
quite unusual for me quite like edgy and
street style for me but something that
I'm very much looking forward to
injecting into my spring wardrobe and
then the third and final thing from Ted
Baker is this pair of trousers and I
know they're black shock horror for me
very different I know but I thought that
these would be a really nice mix between
a smart work trouser but something
that's also really comfortable they've
got an elasticated waistband which is
always great but because they are a
black kind of cigarette style trials
that I thought they'd be great for days
when I'm doing meetings and things like
that and then the pearls down the side
just make them super cute and feminine
which makes them absolutely perfect for
my style once again with a silk t-shirt
even a top like this like a lacy top
this is from a coast I'll leave this one
links down below as well as everything
that I'm mentioning I just thought
they'd be a very versatile addition to
my spring wardrobe and once again the
kind of thing that's pretty much a
staple in your wardrobe so something
that I reach for year after year so this
is the delivery that arrived today that
I really wanted to open with you guys it
is a few pieces from the new collection
at
millon now you know when you see
something on a hanger in a shop and you
just know that that is the kind of thing
that you are going to wear so so so much
well that's exactly how I felt when I
saw this this is the kind of thing that
just makes an outfit it's the kind of
item in your wardrobe where your outfit
building is made so much easier because
this goes with so many things jeans
trousers leather leggings midi skirts
mini skirts maxi skirts cigarette
trousers I could go on and on and on
this type of top is so so versatile this
is the kind of design that you just
don't find on the high street you don't
really find it in these really
affordable retailers because brands like
Karen Millen just take the craftsmanship
and their design to the next level and
they know what kind of pieces we really
want to wear and they go to the next
level when it comes to creating
beautifully fitted pieces this how many
one tried it on yet but you just know
that it's going to fit you so so
beautifully you'll be able to see it in
the Tryon clip so I'm inserting over the
screen now and because of this neckline
I think it's just going to look so
unusual and yet so classic at the same
time so prepare to see me wearing this a
lot over the coming months and all
throughout summer probably in autumn as
well with a shirt underneath or
something I already am absolutely
smitten with this top something else is
a real classic piece that again I know
I'm going to get so much wear out of I
actually wore this when I did some
filming in the Karen melon head office
for a video for their social channels I
wore this to film it and absolutely fell
in love it's a very classic piece and
yet you've got this knot detail around
the waist which just adds an interesting
details it's not just a plain at jumper
the quality of the material is
absolutely beautiful it fits the body in
the most fabulous way and because it is
a high neck it's nice and warm so on
those chilly spring days I think it's a
kind of piece that I'll be reaching for
very very frequently a lot of whites in
this haul because I just love wearing
whites and creams definitely my color
palette then we have this pair of
trousers this is a pair of classic
cigarette style trousers again from
Karen Millen nice and high-waisted
they'll be very very flattering I'll
probably wear these with sandals with
closed toe pointed toe boots at this
time of year when it's a little bit
chilly and then I'll definitely be
wearing with things like stilettos as
well when I want to be a little bit more
smart these you could certainly wear for
work you could wear with a blouse
absolutely beautiful and then you can
also pair it with something a little bit
more casual for days when you are not at
the office
I think these past three pieces with
Karen Millen are real good example of
the kind of things it is definitely
worth spending that little bit more
because they are so classic so timeless
and they're just the kind of things that
make your outfit look a whole lot more
expensive a lot more put together very
polished and there's so timeless that
they won't be going out of season
whether you wear them next year this
year in a couple months time in a couple
of years time they're the kind of things
that'll stay in your wardrobe for a very
very long time so well worth the
investment this last one is another
slightly out there piece and as soon as
I saw it on the hanger I was very
attracted to it and then I took it into
the fitting rooms put it on and
absolutely fell in love so many people
say that a leather jacket is an
essential part of their wardrobe but
I've never really found one that I loved
and that felt very me until I saw this
and I feel like this could be a Marmite
product but I love it it fits so
beautifully the quality is amazing it's
so different and yet at the same time
it's classic and timeless I don't know
how they do it it's gold it's not even
rose gold it's like almost a pewter
e-gold but oh my goodness as you can see
from the Tryon Clips I just love it it
fits such a dream it's such a beautiful
piece and I think this over an all-white
outfit is gonna be so so so gorgeous
you're gonna be seeing me wearing this
so much in the spring and you can tell
it's going to one of those pieces that
when you wear it people are going to be
like oh my god your jacket is so cool
where's it from a real conversation
piece and I don't if you can tell from
my voice I'm just so excited cannot wait
to wear this and yeah I'm in love next a
couple of pieces that I bought recently
from a club Monaco one of my other
favorite premium retailers whenever I go
to the States
I always try to like stock up on their
pieces but these I got in store on
Sloane Square on a day that they were
actually doing a 30% off offer which was
amazing so this you may have seen me
wearing on my Instagram or on the video
that I filmed with Freddie a couple of
weeks ago but it's just a very classic
spring a dress you've got two scalloped
hem you've got a scalloped waistband and
then Scala
detail up here so very very pretty and
feminine but also still really
professional and very very timeless the
fit of this is gorgeous they've got
darts and pleats in all the right places
so it is a very flattering dress and
lengthwise it's very elegant too so
whether I wanted to wear it for a day of
meetings or if I wanted to wear it with
some nice strappy sandals for a
christening a I was gonna say some
wedding definitely don't worry white
dress to a summer wedding and but I
could probably wear this to Wimbledon or
to the Polo or to a christening that
kind of thing is definitely a lovely
occasion where a dress that can be
dressed up and dress down so another
very birth towel piece for my wardrobe
and then also from Club Monaco we have
this belt and on the day that I was
shopping I was wearing my cream or the
island coats and it just has a matching
waist belt on it at the moment but I
tried this on over the top and I felt
that it instantly just updated what is
quite a plain looking coat into
something that was really really
fabulous this is totally adjustable so
you can pull it in pull it out to any
shape that you need so it can be very
very silhouette enhancing very waist
cinching in it so very very flattering
great for creating a very feminine
silhouette I plan to wear this mostly
with coats to really cinch them in and
just to bring some pink to my outerwear
but also if I end up getting any kind of
boho style dresses I think this will be
a really lovely way of cinching them in
and just adding a slightly more pink
touch to my outfit so yeah not one that
I've worn yet but something I'm excited
to inject into my wardrobe and then a
couple of accessories to finish this is
my latest find from Amazon of fashion
who knew you could buy Fendi sunglasses
from Amazon I've been looking for a kind
of go-to investment pair of sunglasses
for a little while now and everything
about these is just absolutely perfect I
really love tor toys shell I find that
it's just a very kind of flattering
color combination and the knees have got
pink sides so my favorite color they
don't have a nozzle here on the nose so
if I've got my hair in a ponytail and I
put them on my head and then take them
off it's not going to totally ruin my
hairstyle and they just feel very well
made obviously they are Fendi's they are
a designer product you would expect them
to be very well made and they're just
the kind of thing that go with
absolutely everything so these are wore
pretty much the whole time we were
in Vienna I had lots of you commenting
on them in my Instagram photos and once
again with all of these pieces they will
not be going out of style any time soon
they're real classic so something that
I'll be able to wear year after year so
I'm going to finish off with a couple of
pairs of shoes and first of all I picked
up this pair of non gym trainers from
Kerr Geiger I think they're actually
yeah these are car vela so I've been
looking for a pair of trainers that are
kind of fashion trainers as opposed to
workout trainers because I feel like I
don't have that much casual footwear in
my wardrobe when I go on holiday or work
trip sometimes you just want to have
something practical on your feet for
doing a lot of exploring but you don't
want to sacrifice your style so these I
thought would be a really nice
combination of a good looking shoe but
also something very practical from those
days when I do need to do a lot of
walking the color is a beautiful blush
pink so we'll go with all of my wardrobe
and then it does have the metallic
detail on the sides and a very metallic
heel section design details that I
absolutely love and also a classic pair
of sandals this is again that the kind
of thing that will work with so many
different outfit combinations the kind
of thing will work with dresses jeans
maxi skirts and mini skirts absolutely
loads of different outfit combinations
and I feel like a pair of nude sandals
is a real staple in a spring wardrobe
definitely should have included these in
yesterday's video all about spring
essentials these are Kurt Geiger own
brand and yeah they're just an absolute
basic essential piece of for my wardrobe
so that's everything that I've picked up
from the premium high street lately as I
mentioned everything will be linked down
below so open up the description box for
all the information you'll need don't
forget to subscribe we still have a
couple more spring edit videos coming

haul so if this was just a little bit
