joining me for another video in the
fashion of mumbler summer hall week so
every day this week I'm doing a whole
video because it's the change in the
seasons and the shot off sort of the
most beautiful things right now
yesterday's video is all about
affordable fashion everything was under
fifty pounds so it's out know your cup
of tea then I'll leave that links down
below but today's video is a little bit
more premium it's that gap between high
street and luxury for me premium high
street is brands like Reese whistles Ted
Baker Club Monaco French Connection and
for me premium high street is a really
nice middle ground when I wants to
invest a little bit more in certain
style I think I'm going to get a lot of
wear out of it then the premium high
street is my go-to area so in state hall
I've got quite lots in Club Monaco from
both the London store the website and
also when I went to New York Fifth
Avenue excuse exo-m's it is growing in
the background and I've got a cup a bit
from French Connection which I actually
ordered from a table and then a few bits
and bobs from Ted Baker as well
certainly so without further ado let's
get started today's lipstick by the way
is the L'Oreal coloration map which I'm
wearing a different color in every video
this week because I just received
another blogger mail and I love the look
at the colors today's one is six six
three maca chic in case you're wondering
I lose at length on the line so the
third piece in the hall for today is
this beautiful smoky dress from French
Connection decided to invest a little
bit more in this one because smoke
dresses are such a staple for summer I
find them so easy to wear because you
literally just shove them on with a
really cute pair of sandals and that's
your outfit done so really kind of
mindless outfit decision this is a
really classic style got a blue and
white stripes and then it's got this
really lovely lace detail down at the
bottom which just gives it a really full
feminine edge it sums off the shoulder
style so very much hitting that trend
for summer 2017 because of this elastic
ated top it's just so comfortable really
easy to sling on over top of a kini and
just a fabulous one to pack in my summer
suitcases it's also got pockets which I
love I just find outfits look so much
more chilled when they've got pockets
then I'll see why
I just love that candid kind of pose
with your hands in your pockets super
tragic but yes I pick this up from
French Connection but it is actually I
ordered it from a sauce I just find
ordering French Connection on a sauce so
much easier I know the return policy I
know when it's going to arrive yeah
those are just so easy I did take other
few more French Connection pieces which
I will get to later in the hall the next
thing in my power to show you however is
this dress from Club Monaco I got this
on the Fifth Avenue store in New York
and it was in the sale so a really
lovely bargain I'm afraid I don't have
the price ticket on it still because I
wanted a few times but such a really
lovely classic style you've got this
detail on the sleeves where it's kind of
two edges of scarce material just
lightly stitch together in the middle
which gives us really beautiful effect
Taylor if you've got those darts in the
middle really fits beautifully along the
bodice zip closure up and down the back
just a really beautiful material a very
elegant link as well so perfect for
summer parties christenings weddings and
a little bit more grown up and mature if
that's the vibe that you also like in
your wardrobe like I do
I think this falls just about the new
length and you can very easily take it
up if you wanted to or we do have a
scalloped finishing going although down
the sides as well but yeah really lovely
selfies from a club in Monaco also from
the Fifth Avenue store I picked up this
embellished skirt so it's just a really
beautiful scalloped detail going down to
the scalloped finished hem at the bottom
quite a short skirt but for me it comes
up to be maybe a few inches above the
knees they're not too short it fits
beautifully and I'm sure that I will get
a load of youth out of it because
actually down here I also have the one
that I bought last year so this is last
year's version again it's got the
scalloped edge on the bottom again it's
comes in embroidery pretty much the
exact same cut and I wore this so much
with white blouses or little desktops
just last summer I wore this so there's
so many times and because this one is
just even more beautiful it's definitely
my kind of coloring you've got these
really beautiful lush pink and grey
beading all over it I think I'm gonna
wear this even more than I wore the blue
last year I have a size double zero fits
me absolutely perfectly and you actually
may have already seen me wearing this
because I think a blog post of me
styling this up when live on my blog a
couple of days ago so I'll leave that
link down below if you want to see how
I've styled it and there's a few more
close-up photos so yeah love that skirt
from Club Monaco also Club Monaco
another piece you may have very seen
because I've had this for a few weeks
now and I've worn it out that you loads
is this beautiful white fit-and-flare
style skirt with the pom-pom details at
the bottom because it's white and fairly
simple for folks from the pom-poms it's
actually works with so many different
looks it looks great with more smart
blouses I've worn it with a real shirt
style blouse it looks great and more
casual to shoulder tops and once again a
beautiful length and really flattering
length just a real staple I think in the
summer wardrobe I think white skirts
just really easy to add into your
collection and this is not going to be
going out of style anytime soon spring
onto spring I think keep coming back to
this because on the end of the day it's
just a white skirt with pom-poms on so
it's not going to be going out of trend
so a really good long-term investment
piece this skirt I picked up from the
London store actually before I got the
pom-pom one but I haven't worn it quite
so much just a little bit and more
flared out it's more mystic cottony new
material again you've got a slight
scholars at the bottom and this bow
finish I really need to get more out of
this I think because the shape I'm just
not quite sure what style top two out of
it so if you've got any ideas and
definitely let me know in the comments
below but I'm going to take this to
France in me tomorrow I'm going to the
South of France and I'm hoping to get a
lot of wear outfit there so if by the
time I add it this I have found
something to style it with I leave a
photo here otherwise it will just be a
throat of it on the website so that you
know what it looks like on but yeah
determined to get another ground this is
a beautiful style once again so classic
and timeless and one that I reached for
year after year this is one of the tops
I have been wearing with the white
pom-pom skirt it's a blue off the
shoulder very lightly striped top from
Club Monaco it actually needs an iron
I'm afraid
grabbed its take off the dryer I wore it
loads in Madrid I'm going to pack it for
France again tomorrow but yeah I've been
running this absolutely loads it does
have an elasticated detail in the arms
here so you can read just pull it up and
make it look a lot more casual you can
tuck it in like I did with white lots a
really versatile piece I remember at the
time thinking was far too expensive or
it was but I'm determined to get a lot
of youth outfit and I just find it
really comfortable to wear
really lovely lightweight material great
for summer holidays and because it is
slightly longer sleeve I think I will
wear a lot in the UK summer as well
the next piece in my pile of clothing to
show you is this beautiful jacket from
Ted Baker so I love to have this kind of
thing in my wardrobe for summer because
it's really great for any summer events
that happen to run into the evening and
you just want some things for over your
shoulders when it gets a little bit
chilly also great for taking a broad
with you because you never know what the
temperatures are going to do once
confirm that goes down this is such a
classic style
it's a white bordering on cream jacket
you've got rose gold detail rose gold on
dips on the toggle and then also on zips
and sleeve really beauty made very high
quality and I just love the scalloped
hem detail which also continues over
onto the sleeves as well very Ted Baker
style with the beautiful lining as well
it's very subtle but you've got this
floral silk material on the lining I'm
just so impressed with the quality of
this it's such a timeless piece and I'm
going to be getting a lot of this this
summer over the top of my lovely summery
dresses so words cannot explain how
excited I am to wear this I spotted this
in Selfridges and despite the absolutely
astronomical price tag I cannot even
bring myself to say it out now I will
leave a link down below if you're
feeling Newsies subscribe the crazy
price tag I absolutely love this
swimming costume it's from a brand
called
same swim and I hadn't heard of the
brand before but I stumbled across it in
the luxury swimwear area and sausages
and thought it was just so so beautiful
the stripe detail the colors and then I
don't know if you can see this actually
got gold studs all the way around the
neckline and then it's a very low-cut
back as well so it's going to go all the
way down to the back it's very high next
so it should be really leg lengthening
hopefully very flattering and so we want
aspect feel a lot more comfortable
insulin costume from bikinis so I don't
mind spending that little bit extra I
splurged out on a Mauritius and in
costume last summer and it was one of
the best decisions I made I felt so
great wearing it and when you feel great
in a swimming costume I think it's worth
investing that little bit more so you're
going to do this a lot on my Instagram
over the next few weeks and months but
yeah really really glad I picked this up
I'm so excited to give it its debut
hopefully over the next couple of days
and from so another French Connection
piece again I picked this up on a sub
just a really classic care of denim
shorts these have got some colorful
stitching around the pocket detail just
with the stitching a little bit
different to your usual denim shorts but
I actually don't think I have a terribly
classic pair of denim shorts in my
wardrobe so I picked these up and shrug
a lot of you started those over some out
and then we have another Club Monaco top
which means ironing this is pretty much
the same as the blue ones but in white
it has a slightly more ruffled effect on
me off the shoulder detail again it has
the elasticated arm bit so you can
really pull it up
this one has a tie fastening any arm I
always kind of think I look a bit like a
pirate when I wear this but really
beautiful lightweight material a great
piece of summer holidays sitting on
after a long day at the beach is just a
really beautiful style and I have tried
a few high street versions of tops like
this because I appreciate it is very
simple to spend the amount of money that
it cost I think it's about 125 pounds
from Club Monaco and but now the high
street ones really have the same effect
of this I just think this is a style
that's going to keep on coming back into
fashion and it does look truly beautiful
on so no regrets with that little
splurge I have a piece here from Club
Monaco that I haven't even unwrapped yet
I got this on the Sloane Square Flo
Monaco the one in Chelsea and a couple
of days ago with April we were both on
an over high that day because we were
both celebrating getting some really
good news on that day and this dress is
actually called the April dress one of
those things myself is really meant to
be so let me show you it's the
beautiful white very Santorini style
dress you've got a beautiful very um
you've got a beautiful bright colored
beading around the neckline I'm not sure
if you can see that it's basically got
like rainbow colors tiny tiny beads
around the neckline and the rainbow
detail is replicated on the drawstring
which pulls in at the waist and I think
I'm going to wear this not only when
abroad in UK from perhaps a little denim
jacket over the shoulders to make it a
bit more casual at that you love this
hopefully I'll have worn it already in
France and I can show you a photo if not
once again both of it on the website but
you can just imagine how beautiful this
is going to look on and yes going to get
tons of wear this this summer and last
but not least one more French Connection
via a source dress this one is a really
beautiful incredibly lightweight from a
dress just super super light and floaty
material so great if you're off and you
are really really hot any of the Greek
islands Spain Italy if you're going to
be hot then this is just absolute
perfect for that the material is
SuperDuper light and flowy to color
itself like a lemon sorbet is so
refreshing and it's also really great if
you like to catch a pan while you're out
and about super low back you've got
these fins to get these straps a nice
low v-neck and then it goes into this
lovely light ruffle and then as well as
the ruffles and pleats you've got this
slight embroidery detail on the skirt it
looks really effective on and it's quite
tight around the globe area
so if you have been in the gym and
you've got a bit of Toni on your tummy
and you can actually kind of see this
weirdly through the dress that was one
thing I noticed when I was wearing this
in Spain last week but yeah the color I
just absolutely adore reminds me of yes
lemon sorbet so another one that I am
huge fan of and will be wearing on lots
of upcoming holidays
unsure so those are the pieces I picked
up from the more premium and the high
street lately let me know if there are
any pieces that you guys have got your
eye on on the more premium end of the
high street at the moment and let me
know your favorite retailers are in that
kind of zone if there's any that I
haven't men
and you think I'd like to let me know
overall I'm very happy with my
splurgio's yes these pieces are a little
bit more on the expensive side of the
scale but I think that will fabulous
quality I can see myself getting a lot
of use out of them and you guys know how
fast I am with price per where so thin
across them getting a ton of use out of
these pieces to bring that price per
wear down and down and down so yeah
that's all for me I really hope you guys
enjoyed today's video and make sure
you're subscribed if you don't want to
miss any more of my calls
