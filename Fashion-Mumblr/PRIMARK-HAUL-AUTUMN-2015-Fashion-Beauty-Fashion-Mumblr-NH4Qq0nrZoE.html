joining me for today's video
it is my autumn Primark haul I did a
find my call for spring/summer which
I'll link down below but we all know all
that stuff is gonna be sold out so maybe
just stick around for this one
so the normal problem up shopping bag
was actually too small for all the stuff
that I bought so I had to buy I didn't
have to but I bought one of these bags
as well I actually bought three of them
because I thought it'd be really useful
for loft storage it's that kind of time
of year when we don't really know if
it's spring or summer what stuff you're
not spring whether it's summer or winter
but what I do know is that soon I will
be having it to bring down my autumn
clothes from the loft and putting my
summer ones away for storage
I'll stop fighting me I'm being attacked
I'm being bitten by little mutts down
little boy in a mischievous mood so I'll
be using these Primark bags to put away
all my summer stuff for storage until at
the spring time next year but anyway
slight distraction ramble aside let's
see what I bought in the last video I
mentioned that I just got back from the
autumn winter press day and in the press
day there were so many beautiful bags
and I just I was basically counting down
the days until the bags hit the store
and they are finally in not all of them
but a lot of the bags which we were all
lusting for over the past day and this
is one of them so this is a tassel bag
in a gorgeous like burgundy / mulled
wine color and the price so paid 12
pounds for this one which I'm really
chuffed with think it's it's making the
color go really weird on the camera
there we go
trying to see me getting shot without it
changing the colour of my face but it's
a gorgeous color wine colored bag with
gold detailing lovely tassels and the
tassel trend I don't link is going
anywhere so great trendy bag and I don't
think I've ever owned a drawstring bag
before so really looking forward to
having that quite a relaxed fit and I
think it'll be great for just putting
loads of things in it my camera and my
phone my makeup it's all gonna fit in
here and a lovely long chain strap as
well and then you can either use it you
can either film
the way through and now it's like a
shoulder bag or you can pick it out
besides they know not for puppies to
chew or pick it up at both sides and
have it as a member like a sling it over
your shoulder as opposed to all the way
over you know what a guy you know I mean
so this is really lovely and really glad
I got this they also had it in black but
I have text how did you see that I have
quite a few black bags so no stupid
mixing thing see look this is what's
happening right now he's some naughty
naughty it's not for puppies it's for me
so yeah they had that bag in black as
well but I thought the burgundy was just
a lovely chain so that's why I picked up
that one but I did get another bag I got
this 10 that saddle type of bag I mean
we all know that it's slightly similar
looking to Khloe drew jute bags which
have been everywhere but it's got the
studs on it and a nice strap there was
also a black version but it had a kind
of fabric strap I think like Instagram
that at the press stay the black version
but I won't before the tan I really
loved the studs on it and it's a great
size I think it's a lot bigger than my
Chloe true jeeps that I have so it's
going to fit a lot more bits and bobs in
it whereas I have to be quite selective
with my other one and again it's got the
tassel detail
I haven't taken out of the packaging yet
but you can see it's got a nice like
tassel and keyring on the side which is
really really cute this one again twelve
pounds and I mean you cannot go wrong
within 12 pounds for handbag it's just
crazy I think even if you only get one
so seasons use out of it 12 pounds for
bag like this absolutely gorgeous okay
this is really random but I got a bra
first-aid kit so it's got a bracelet
back converter bra extenders and nipple
covers and fashion tape and I can't say
I've ever really had a need for any of
these things but I thought I'm gonna try
and buy some more nice like party
dresses in the upcoming season and this
was four pounds I thought even if it's
the kind of thing that I just put in my
underwear drawer
and just keep it for storage you know
there's just in case situations I
thought it might be handy so chucked one
of those in the basket impulse purchase
maybe but yeah I just thought it would
be handy to have we're getting to like
the random things Eufaula clothing but
we're just gonna go
I picked up some more hair bubbles
Primark air bubbles a pound for all of
these and they don't have the metal in
which for me is absolutely correct
because the metal just seems to snag in
my hair and I do wish they had a whole
selection of blond ones I think they had
a whole selection of black ones but
Primark I mean come on
these ones are not gonna fit my hair
colour the black ones and the dark brown
so please bring out a blonde range
because I buy it and I'm sure there's
our blonds apply it to shoes I picked up
this pair of grey suede effect I'm
guessing they're not going real sweet
because they were 14 pounds but I
thought these would be great for just
adding a little bit of extra height when
I wear my autumn outfits they got a
lovely big platform and a huge chunky
heel which in my hand just means comfy
and these big wide straps and straps and
call covers I don't know and yeah I just
thought these to be very comfortable
pair of shoes they are obviously cheap
and grey so they're gonna get messed up
they're gonna get dirty but I think at
that price I already mind operates end
up wearing these one season when they
get gross they'll just go in the bin or
to a charity shop but yeah I thought
these are you really lovely they look
really comfy and Becca who are shopping
with said that she had the black ones
last year and she will don't absolutely
loads and I just think they're going to
be a nice autumn essential foot cushions
and other than those impulse purchases
but it gained two pounds they always
come in handy especially when you bring
your autumn boots down from the loft and
you find that the soles are a little bit
monkey you or them all last year so this
will be used you freshen up some of my
autumn boots and we're finally onto
clothes so let's see what I've got first
I think there's my actually two items
yes it is okay so this is probably my
favourite piece and it's a white blouse
with a beautiful tie detail down the
front along with the neckline x10 ya
know he's in such a playful mood it's so
cute
have your crocodile so this was ten
pounds and I thought it's gonna be a
really lovely piece I can probably wear
like a little vest top underneath it
when it gets a bit chillier it's got a
very wide neckline so probably not good
for wearing thermals underneath and it's
very thin so I think I'm gonna have to
wear this one sooner rather than later
before it gets too chilly but a nice
piece for layering with a nice fuzzy
layer over the top it's going to be
really lovely and a great piece for that
folk trends that we're all still loving
it's got gold ringlets
around the loopholes which
really pretty detail and yeah for what
ten pounds I say yeah ten pounds I think
this is a great autumn essential piece I
think we should all have a little folk
flowers in our wardrobe for this autumn
the next one is a more classic flower so
this is a plain white blouse with a bit
of a bow going on on the front
it's obviously fallen out now but this
will look really nice when it's tied up
in a bow around the neckline again long
sleeve to the Salaf lovely tucked into
some nice autumn skirts high-waisted
skirts high-waisted trousers you just
can't really go wrong with a white
blouse and I think the bow detail along
the neckline it's going to be another
trend that we're all loving this autumn
I think this might be the exact same
blouse but in a rust color but I'm
absolutely loving this color it's not
the same blouse because it's got buttons
down the front the other one didn't have
buttons but this is a rust colored
blouse at the bow detail and the
buttons down the front again 10 pounds
and I think over white jeans a salute
gorgeous or gained tucked into skirts
high-waisted trousers and the color of
the season so this is a really lovely
piece it's also got the button detail on
the sleeves which is great for if you
want to roll it up for slightly more
casual look and then the final clothing
piece is this pair of trousers now in
winter I love like comfy trousers not
necessarily denim I don't find denim
terribly comfortable but these are quite
a stretchy probably polyester material
let's have a look okay I can't find my
rights as a material but I think it's
like a polyester it's got a bit of
stretch into it and it's got quite a
cute pattern these look kind of like
diamonds to me I thought it'd just be
really nice prints for wearing around
the house and the daytime and also
really good travel trousers because they
do have that stretch in them so they
definitely got me nice and comfy they've
got a zip on the side so they're not
that whole like they're not so stretchy
that you can pull them up so does it on
the waist is definitely a necessity
these ones were 11 pounds so I think
again great for being a little bit
smarter when I'm just working from home
I think they're really nice
monochrome chic pair of trousers and
that's actually all the fashion bits
that I picked up in my head I thought I
had so much more but it's because
they've also brought some home wear but
because I bought so much Primark home
wear and also H&amp;amp;M home where I'm gonna
film another separate video so you guys
will have to tune in for that one but
this haul is not over because I also got
a few makeup pieces I've never tried
Primark makeup before
but on the same day I also went into hmm
picked up some of their new makeup range
and I have done a video for that so have
a little watch of that one which I'll
link down below but from primark makeup
I picked up their beautiful bronze glow
stick highlighter because I've never
tried really a budget highlighter and I
wanted to compare this to the higher end
brands because I can't really think that
they'll be that much difference so I'm
really excited to give this a go it was
three pounds and I thought I knew three
pounds of nothing but I thought it
proved a little bit cheaper maybe $1.99
so we'll see how this is and then a
liquid lipstick and this is the most
gorgeous shade I'm gonna see if you guys
and if you can see the shade of this
lipstick but it's like a dusky pinky
almost brown and really reminded me of
my Sephora and that lip lustre so I'm
hoping this is going to be a really good
tip of that it looks like it gives quite
a matte finish I'm just gonna do a
little swatch on my hands it's a very
intense color so it's going to be one of
those that really paints on the lips
which I'm really looking forward to
actually trying on my lips so I think
you guys know how I get on with this and
lastly a white snail vanish I mean I've
already got a berry on white now vanish
but look at the packaging on this I
thought this is really beautiful it's
got the gold handle and Sat handle and
gold lid screwby thing I'm not sure what
you call it but white and gold thought
this is really beautiful and would just
be a nice addition to my Nirvana straw
and I've never tried Primark now a bunch
before so I thought I'd give it a go and
if it's good then for one pound 50 I
will definitely be trying out some more
shades and then the last couple of bits
I bought really boring but just a couple
of cotton pads
I thought for 50p matte they were really
good I mean I think in Boots you pay
like $1.99 for tube this big and this is
really tragic but they actually look
quite good quality they've got like the
stitching around the edges and my boots
ones I'm using at the moment they fall
apart when I put my micellar water on
them so I thought that these might be
good ones and yeah 50p for one of those
I picked up two packets and that's it
guys I feel like that was the world's
quickest Primark haul maybe it's um yeah
just not as big as I thought it was but
as I said I got some home by two and I
think that video will be out next week
so please come back and have a look at
that one I've got some lovely pieces for
both myself and for these little boy
because it will boys need help my dear
he's so tired now after all that banging
yeah yes so I hope you've enjoyed this

you did if you're new to my channel then

that case I shall see you in my next
