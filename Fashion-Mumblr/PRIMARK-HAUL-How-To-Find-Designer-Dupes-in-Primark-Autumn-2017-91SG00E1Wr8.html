joining me for today's video it's going
to be a Primark haul it's been a long
time since I lasted a Primark haul but I
went in there recently to the Marble
Arch store with the mission of getting
myself some new coat hangers and I ended
up picking up quite a few pieces so I
thought seeing as it is fashion mumbler
whole week that I would include an
entire Primark haul video so this week
every single day there is a new home
video going live in my channel you guys
have already had a Xaro haul and a river
ivan hall and there is so much more
still has to come so please do hit that
subscribe button down below and make
sure the notifications are switched on
if you don't want to miss any of my
upcoming haul so someone that only went
into the store planning to get coat
hangers I ended up getting quite a lot
and I really liked a lot of things they
had in there actually they had quite a
few designer dupes and I'm going to talk
a little bit about how I spot designer
dupes in Primark and then lots of really
lovely blush pink pieces as well which
you all know I'm a huge huge fan so I'm
just going to get straight stuck in
there the first thing that I have in my
shopping basket is this blush colored
velvet kind of crushed velvet style
dressing gown and at this time of the
year I'm not quite ready for my full-on
big floppy dressing gown but I do want
something to just keep the chill off
when I go downstairs and make my morning
coffee so I picked this one up I thought
it was just such a beautiful color
it's got crop sleeves like 3/4 length
sleeves which personally I find it
really really practical when I'm like
making the dogs their breakfast or
making my own breakfast I don't want my
sleeves hanging out all over the place
it also has pockets which I find really
handy as well and generally just really
really love this color so I'll pop it on
to show you how it look we go so
obviously it's not the warmest thing in
the world but you know it's like this
first thing in the morning so you just
want to have something on while you do
make her or make your breakfast and I
thought this was absolutely perfect the
next thing that I picked up was actually
a beauty goop I've heard really good
things about these this is the Primark
get lippy matte collection and it does
look very very similar to the Kylie lip
kit I've not tried it out yet but I'm
very intrigued to do so it was only
three pound
and that wouldn't even cover your
shipping the Kylie lip kit so a really
really good discount on that if it's
anything like it is and other said I
have been speaking to a few beauty
bloggers friends and I've heard really
good things so keep on my Instagram
stories if you want to see my first
impressions of this so I will be giving
it to go I chose the color cookie dough
which again I'm not sure if the Kylie
lip kids actually have fun with I like
that name they'd probably be pushing it
a little bit if they did but that's the
color that I've got and it's really
lovely nudibranch which should be really
beautiful for the upcoming autumn season
you get a matte liquid lipstick and a
lip liner in the kit so those two for
three pounds I was very much impressed
by and then a fairly boring but
practical purchase I picked up the
Primark cotton discs you call them round
cotton pads if you've watched my pro
knock calls in the past you'll know they
always pick these up I just really like
to Primark ones at 50p each so very
affordable cheap and boots and I like
the fact that the two discs are like
stitch together so you don't get them
falling apart when you're using them so
I always get those when I go into
Primark the next thing in this bag and I
promise not everything can pink but I
picked up this cardigan this was 9 note
8 pounds and once again blush pink
colour this I thought would just be so
nice for when you come home from work or
you just you're lounging around the
house and you just want something around
your shoulders not anything as casual as
a dressing-gown but just something to
warm you up a little bit I just thought
this was really really lovely very soft
material and eight pounds you just can't
really go wrong I like this long-sleeved
it's kind of just the low below the hips
midway through the side lengths they're
really lovely length and you do have
little pockets in there as well not that
I'll probably end up using them but just
a really cozy piece and it's really the
people that you know you'll wear time
and time again when you are just
chilling out around the next thing that
I got is a scarf another pink piece this
one was and okay there's nothing to your
price tag on this oh here we go six
pounds and I actually ordered a very
very similar scarf from Topshop and it
was more than double that price so when
I went into the store and I felt how
soft it was I was really impressed and I
think I will send my
shot one back because this is just so
much better value I think it's a really
lovely color too
you definitely can't really tell this
Primark in fact it has a little rose
gold disc here which would almost eat
people to think it as Ted Baker it's
such a small design detail but when you
buy things from affordable fashion
stores you don't normally get those
extra design details are very happy to
see this little gold disc but yeah it's
just a really lovely soft material will
be really nice to snuggle up in when the
temperatures do really start to drop and
it's just dry normos which is great so
you can really just get super duper cozy
and yeah it's just such a lovely color
really flashing on the skin tone and
definitely the kind of thing I can
imagine getting bundled up in as the
temperatures drop next up and I promise
you this is the last pink clothing piece
I picked up this juillet so I actually
had one from River Island last year that
was very similar but it was very
expensive compared to this from at least
and I actually wore it lowered so I
thought I would treat myself to a blush
pink version this was 18 pounds so
incredibly good value the faux fur on
the inside is just super soft it's like
that blanket material that's just really
really snuggly and then you've got the
faux suede on the outside as well I
actually sized up on this because I
really want to use this as a layering
piece so I'll probably maybe use like a
waist belt and to cinch it in and yeah
really really like so it's got big
pockets too so you can pop your phone in
there your keys if you're just nipping
out but also I think this time of year
when it's not quite cold yet it's just a
really lovely piece chucking on and
adding another layer of interest to
outfit so here we have my first real
fashion goop from my Primark haul these
as I'm sure most of you know our major
dupes for the excite Susanna boots in
fact I actually have the clarity down a
bit here I haven't worn these yet I just
ordered them from net-a-porter and as
you can see design geek our wives very
very similar but it's got three buckles
those have got that kind of studies star
pattern same heel height same length of
course these are a lot more vivid Brown
wear these are more of a muted
weighted grey brown and
hand side whether I'm going to keep
these or not yet I just posted about my
quandary on Twitter a few minutes ago as
someone actually replied saying that
when all the coups started coming out
they actually sold their Chloe designer
boots because they're you didn't want to
wear them when they were so many tubes
available so yeah I've got some serious
thinking to do obviously they are nearly
800 pounds whereas these were 16 pounds
so absolutely insane bargain I got these
in size 3 obviously they're not real
suede they look like normally too sure
what that material is but the 18 pounds
I thought they were pretty good dupe no
one's going to mistake them for the real
thing but they have the exact same style
and give off the same effect that is for
sure even if you don't care about the
fact that they're I do I do think these
are really lovely pair of autumn boots
that look great with white jeans they
look good with my committee skirts that
kind of thing so a really lovely style
and when it comes to finding dupes in
Primark my best tip would just be to
make sure that you're aware of these key
pieces because if you just keep an eye
on Instagram check out with fashion
bloggers wearing what celebrities are
wearing and also just keeping an eye in
a magazines on catwalk shows something
familiar with what the trends are what
these key pieces are then when you spot
things in the store you will instantly
know if it's a dupe for something that
you've seen on the catwalks
a lot of the time you'll also see
bloggers and other people on your social
media raving about gifts we all love to
find a good tube so keep learning and
social feeds and you'll soon find out
when Primark have a really good you can
store not just Primark but other high
street retailers in my aether school
last week I showed you an amazing
self-portrait cube top and I actually
have a whole video on goop so I'll leave
that one links up here so you can check
that out if they are your thing my first
set of coat hangers from this haul I did
go in with the intention of getting
these they are three pounds for three so
a pound each and as you can see I'm a
big fan of rose gold and copper coat
hangers so I stocked up onto your tippy
ones as you go into autumn I find I have
a lot more skirts I need hanging so
these will come in very very handy I got
three set so nine new coat hangers this
was something I grabbed at the till it
is a dual USB charging cable three
pounds I just thought that would come in
really handy like charging my phone for
my laptop and it's just a very small
gold cable for three pounds I thought I
would grab that and then the last thing
in the first carry bag is this it is a
Primark home throw and it has kind of
like a chevron pattern on it but this
was six pounds and it is so so so soft I
always want to be snuggled up in the
evenings with the lovely soft throw in
the autumn when the temperatures start
to go down so I thought this would be
absolutely perfect and six pounds
company go wrong all right we're now on
to the second carrier bag and this is
the main thing that I went into Primark
to look for one of my friends also
youtuber Freddie she told me about these
and I knew I had to have them they are
lush coloured almost like velvet so this
will have a little bit of grip so your
clothes so gross lighting off and then a
rose gold or copper hanging bit so
really really beautiful hangers they
will look absolutely gorgeous on my rail
and in my wardrobe as well and very
affordable so for four pounds you get
ten coat hangers I think that is
incredible and I just think they're
stunning so I've got four sets of those
so that's 40 coat hangers enough to
definitely switch over all the hangers
in my water but very cost-effectively
and last but not least another pair of
boots these once again our designer
groups they have very much got like a
Gucci Miu Miu you're right about them
including this frill or muscle it was
called up but this ruffle detail on the
toe and then the pearls definitely give
off future vibes and just even without
that I really really like these boots I
think they're a lovely style when it
comes to black boots I don't wear a lot
of black but I do find that black boots
are always a staple in my autumn
wardrobe these were 16 pounds which i
think is incredible and obviously
they're not the greatest quality and not
real leather I don't think I'm not sure
at that price I don't think they will be
but just to add a touch of style to your
outfit I think they were very affordable
way of doing so and the heel height as
well it's not too high I think I could
definitely get away with wearing these
all day long and they'd still be
comfortable and because they're such
chunky heel they should be quite easy to
walk in as well so you can see myself
getting a lot of use out of these and I
definitely
think they look a lot more high-end 16
bound so overall some really really
lovely pieces I'm very impressed with
Primark at the moment they have some
gorgeous bits in and I can see myself
wearing these so much those becoming for
months let me know in the comments below
