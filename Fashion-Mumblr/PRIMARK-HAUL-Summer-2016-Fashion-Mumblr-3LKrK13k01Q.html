video is my August summer Primark haul
this video is part of my fashion mumbler
hall week so every day this week
I'm putting up a whole video you've
already had misguided hmm a sauce and
now Primark so I have not done a Primark
haul in quite a long time to be honest
when I go in there I do go pretty crazy
but I don't go in that often maybe every
every month or so so this is a
collection of pieces I picked up on my
last visit to Primark and there's a few
autumnal pieces in there a few beauty
pieces and a few pieces that I've
completely forgotten about so whatever
further ado let's just get started I'm
going to start off with some beauty
products or not each products but beauty
tools because they're so small that if I
don't start with and then they're
definitely going to get lost first of
all I picked up this brush and I bought
this with the sole intention of using it
for tanning so in a few days time I'm
going to be publishing my tanning
routine video so you'll see exactly how
I use this but basically I use it to
buff in the tan and it just creates the
most beautiful airbrush finish and it's
got rose gold in it so of course I fell
in love as soon as I saw it I then
picked up this not really sure you'd
call it maybe a sponge on a stick again
it's got the rose gold on it but it's
basically a makeup sponge on on a stick
so I've been using a Beauty Blender a
lot more recently I've really been
enjoying how it applies on my face but I
don't find it that comfortable to hold
so I thought if I got one on a stick
then perhaps it would be a little bit
more what I'm used to with the with a
brush application and again it's got the
point of the top so it's going to get
really close in my nose and my eyes so
really looking forward to trying this
one out and I did actually get my makeup
done at a photo shoot a couple of weeks
ago and one of the makeup artists had a
sponge on a stage
that's definitely not the technical name
I've got no idea what they're called but
the makeup artist was using one of these
and I just sort of looked amazing so
when I saw this it went straight into my
basket also with the rose gold beauty
tool theme I picked up a pair of eyelash
curlers these are identical to my rose
gold tweeze 'men ones which you guys
have seen in so many of my tutorials but
they were about a tenth of the price so
of course I pick them up and I are
colors you can't really go wrong with
them so that just as good it'll curl my
lashes any better or worse than my
tweezer 'men ones but they're just as
beautiful and a fraction of the price so
how you recommend the Primark rose gold
eyelash curlers and finally so handy so
cheap I picked up a rose gold pencil
sharpener so this has two holes in it
one for large pencils like chubby sticks
and then one for normal sized ones as
well so great for eyeliner and lip liner
I always lose these I can never find it
when I need it so I thought if it's rose
gold hopefully it'll be easier to see in
my makeup drawer that was my optimistic
thinking anyway if I lose this I'll just
pick up a load more time pretty sure I
was no more than a pound then we move on
to what's inside the bag I'm afraid the
bag is already ripped I did actually go
to Primark over a week ago so I have
kind of forgotten what I bought so this
is going to be as exciting for me as is
for you guys first thing in there are
these little tumblers so I actually saw
these after I paid and I went back and
paid all over again because I really
really wanted these they've got a lovely
Indian II I really need to know what the
name of this design is if you saw my hmm
haul you'll see that I got matching jug
it's like a teardrop with like Indian
style dots over it so really gorgeous
design and they're plastic so great for
barbecues and not going to smash all
over the place and for four of these
those four pounds so a pound a cup which
is not a mega mega cheap but pretty good
when it comes to barbecue crockery a
dishwasher saved as well so you can have
your pins and then stick them in the
dishwasher to worry about later then
inside my bag is a pair of slippers so
when I spotted these the first thing I
thought was wow they look so similar to
my EMU slippers and emu slippers are
incredible they are lick
like walking on clouds but almost a
hundred pounds so pretty expensive
especially when you have a puppy dog who
likes to shred things so I thought I'd
try out this full pound option from
Primark they've got a memory foam sole
so hopefully they're also going to be
incredibly comfortable and they're just
such a classic design you've got the
suede feeling it's obviously not suede
of that price but a suede effect um top
toe cap area and then the faux fur here
the EMU ones yes there's so much better
quality this is actually suede and then
actual sheepskin but for four pounds I'm
really really happy I picked these up I
think they had them in pink brown white
but I went for the grey option because
then I thought they looked nice so yeah
looking forward to wearing these and
also another main reason why I got them
is because they are machine washable so
if I get them dirty which I probably
will I always spill tea on my slippers I
can just stick them in the washing
machine and hopefully they'll come out
good as new yeah looking forward to
wearing these and they're so soft they
are so soft as well can't wait to wear
those just need to get a little bit
chillier because I feel like my feet
will be far too hot in these at the
moment
next is a handbag so there's I picked up
because I thought it's quite Khloe ish
but also a really good size if you
compare it to my head you can see how
big this is you've got this beautiful
leather effect it's almost like a
printed design on there can you see the
design and then you've got the studs and
this metal clasp and inside it's
magnetic as well so really easy to open
and close just a really big spacious bag
so this will fit all my daily essentials
a camera my purse my phone my makeup bag
etc and this was let's see this was 9
pounds honestly you can't buy nice bags
that cheap anywhere other than Primark
so really really pleased with this it's
also got a shoulder strap so it's gonna
be really secure I can fling it over one
shoulder I think it'll be really good
for holidays festivals just so many
different occasions and the great thing
about this style is that it's definitely
going to be in fashion in autumn as well
so I'm sure I'm gonna get so much use
out of this also for autumn I've picked
up this coat as soon as I saw it I
thought of two things both of which I
already own but you
never have too many coats firstly my
very first Burberry coat looked exactly
like this but with a Burberry lining I
got it from Vista Village a few years
ago and I love it I wear it so much and
just like that one this one is really
really lightweight so great for this
time of year
maybe it's drizzling a little bit in
England that's like when the rain is
really fine drizzling I don't know but
this isn't an English thing videoing
it's drizzling and you don't want to
wear a full-on raincoat
this kind of thing is perfect for me I
just want something lightweight just to
add a bit of warmth that I can fling on
when I take Dexter for a walk or when I
go to grab some milk go to the post
office or whatever this is going to come
in it's so handy design-wise it's also
almost identical to the coats that Zara
bring out every year as soon as I saw it
I was like wow that's probably come from
the same Factory it's so similar even
when it comes to these shoulder pads
here the buckles the pockets it's pretty
much a deep of the Zara and Burberry
coats I really like the studs on the
collar here too I do wish they were gold
but hey-ho can't have everything
especially when you're only paying
eighteen pounds I think the Zara one is
eighty not 18 and the Burberry one is
probably like 800 I don't know I didn't
pay anywhere near that in VIP in Vista
Village but either way this is a bargain
and I know I'm going to wear this so
much I have just noticed that the zip
here is plastic whereas this one is
metal and that's kind of a sign that it
is cheaper but to be honest this little
pouch here covers that zip so it's not
going to bother me too much so I found a
couple more beauty tools lurking inside
I picked up this set of to nail buffers
so buffing blocks just come in really
really handy especially if you do gel
nails I personally have been wearing a
lot of shellac recently and somewhere I
get my nails done with shellac quite a
lot because it's great for holidays but
then when you take it off you really
need to buff your nails to get that
shine back so buffing blocks in Primark
they're going to be just as good as
expensive OPI ones they do a job that do
it well so these were one pound for two
i'm pretty short OPI ones are four pound
each or something like that so picked up
a couple of those and also eyebrow
trimming scissors yes you heard that
right to be honest I just kind of bought
these as an Express
Raymond you're a pound and my eyebrow
hairs are fairly long in case you didn't
know I recently got my eyebrows tattooed
using micro bleeding I'll leave the
video for that down below but what that
means is that I can keep my eyebrow
hairs pretty short so they always fall
into the natural shape so I thought
these would come in handy just to keep
them looking groomed and perfected and
four-pound so ever try right their socks
you can't go to Primark
and not buy socks I love the invisible
socks I wear them with my trainers all
the time and so I picked up a five pack
of grey ones these feel a little bit
thicker so hopefully they'll be nice and
warm in winter the ones that I have at
the moment quite thin definitely the
summer version but these are cotton so
they wash well and they're comfortable
and yeah you can't see them in your shoe
so if you don't like to have your socks
showing when you're wearing trainers
Primark invisible socks are amazing and
these were three pound fifty four five
Packers last couple of things now and I
also picked up this throw so this is
from the Primark home section by the way
I went to the large Primark at the top
of Oxford Street so the one opposite
Tottenham Court Road station I love
their home section there and their
throws Primark throws are always so soft
honestly I would just cover my house in
these if I felt the need to and if they
become a bit scraggly Dexter housing I'm
looking at his cage now and he's got to
Primark frozen there the charleen I have
used and then I bought new ones so then
they go to Dexter so they always go to a
good home this is just a plain beige one
and I think this will go really nicely
just flung on the back of our sofa as
the evenings start to get a bit cooler I
love to take naps on the sofa in the
evening when Charlie's watching TV and
this is just so soft and snuggly I just
can't wait to snuggle up watching a film
preferably like Harry Potter or
something I haven't watched their Harry
Potter films in so long with a lot of
chocolates and sweets and yeah pretty
much my perfect evening then I picked up
a set of three luxury face cloths so
these are basically flannels I use
every day when I use my cleanser or
taking off face masks a few of my
funnels are starting to get a little bit
green from all those mud masks that I've
been using so I thought for the sake of
how much were these doesn't say for the
sake of to pound 50 I might as well get
myself some new ones and check out the
ones that have gone a little bit minging
these have got a really nice detail
along the edge as well they're not
playing they've just got this beautiful
like honeycomb detail and then slightly
embroidered edge so just a little bit
different to your normal flannels and
really good value as well so useful I'm
hoping that Primark do a few more of
these luxury bits because they're just
so nice to just replace the things I've
gone a little bit tatty in your home
China I've lived here for coming up for
or maybes at five I think coming up for
years
and we've never really replaced anything
like towels so when I see things like
this I always pick them up from my H&amp;amp;M
haul you might remember I picked up some
new hand towels so yeah slowly but
surely we're placing the linen in the
house two more things both of which are
really really handy first of all I got
some eye makeup remover pads sometimes I
don't want to use a whole face wipe
because I just find it a little bit
wasteful so I picked up these little
sachets and they're basically just eye
makeup remover a really good fun holiday
if you get panda eyes or just for
sticking in your trouble makeup bag so
yeah these are a pound for two sets of
30 again amazing value and finally I
picked up a dual USB charging cable so
this is just something so handy to have
in your handbag because we all know what
phone batteries are like they are
rubbish especially iPhone so battery is
crap so if you have a charging cable in
your handbag you can plug it into the
wall so many restaurants now actually
have USB sockets in the wall that is
just so freakin clever or you can just
ask the waiter really nicely can I plug
it into a computer and charge your phone
or you can buy a little charging block
I've got one for I think it's Belkin but
really handy tab in your handbag always
need one of these lying around so yeah I
picked on this one to pound 50 and
what's great about this is on the end
actually has like a dual adapter so it
also has a connection for my charger and
my samsung phones it's a microUSB which
is used for loads of things other than
iPhone so it's great that this has both
in them it's pink it was cheap and yeah
to sort of really really practical
purchase from Primark effect called
Primark touches so that's everything
guys I hope you enjoyed looking through
my Primark haul as always a mixture of
beauty home fashion tech yeah you know
what I'm like I just I just go wild
I'm actually really chuffed I've got so
many actually really usable pieces
nothing is just a whimsical purchase
it's stuff that I'm actually going to
get so much use out of so Pat myself on
