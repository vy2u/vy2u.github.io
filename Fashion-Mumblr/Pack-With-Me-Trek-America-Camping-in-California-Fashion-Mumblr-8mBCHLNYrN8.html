joining me for today's video today is
going to be a pack with me video because
on Sunday I'm going on track America so
in case you don't know what track
America is it's basically a company that
organizes trips to America for kind of
like our age group I'd say maybe 1835
and you can choose where in America you
want to go they have set kind of
itineraries and you can choose how long
you go for I'm going for eight days with
a group of eight bloggers and we're
going to we're doing the west coast trip
so we're starting off by flying to LA
and we're doing Santa Monica Santa
Barbara and then we're going inland to
Yosemite and then we're going back to
the coast and finishing our trip in San
Francisco so when I was packing for this
trip for while I'm packing I've kind of
got in mind that it's not going to be as
rough-and-ready kind of camping as I
originally thought there's a few things
that in other kind of trips I would have
taken with me that I'm leaving behind
and it's more going to be a bit of a
city kind of beachy trip so that's the
vibe that I've gone for when I'm packing
hopefully I've got that right and
because there is quite a lot of things
that I need to go through I'm just gonna
get started so first of all my case is a
huge new suitcase that I got from East
PAC and I decided to get a soft one as
opposed to a hardshell suitcase because
I think if you're camping or and will be
traveling around on a tour bus
a soft case it's just so much easier to
like squish in places it's a lot more
flexible and I feel like it'll be a
little bit more lightweight as well so
I've gone for this big brown one from
East Park I think is quite a practical
color the case opens up into two
sections which is really really handy it
means I can see a lot more of my stuff
more easily and in this first section
you can see I've got my kind of large
items the first thing in that section is
my sleeping bag so I definitely could
have gone it to a shop and bought a
smaller
because this one is about five years old
and I'm sure sleeping bag technology has
come a long way since I bought it and
you can probably get smaller ones now
but I didn't see the point in buying a
new one this one is a four-season
sleeping bag which means it's really
temperature regulating it'll keep me
warm if it's cool it'll keep me cool if
it's warned vice versa and and I got
this a few years ago when I actually
went to Tanzania for a month and I slept
in this in freezing cold temperatures up
on the top of Kilimanjaro so I know that
this is a really good sleeping bag huge
but ya don't want to buy any one so
that's my sleeping bag also from my trip
to Tanzania I have this towel this is
actually called a track towel and I do
have a normal towel in my bag as well
but this is a really really lightweight
on it's kind of like a very absorbent
material so it takes no time at all to
dry it's pink and yeah really really
practical and it folds down that's next
to nothing so that is my track towel and
then also in that large section is my
first packing cube so I watched a few
track America packing videos before I
started my packing process and a lot of
people recommended packing cubes for
keeping all of your belongings kind of
more organized in your case so I have
got a selection of pink packing cubes
and I've tried to organize my clothes in
each of the cubes so inside my first
packing cube I have a lot of my daytime
outfits as I said we're gonna be in
really nice places in California
la Santa Monica Santa Barbara and I do
want to look stylish of course the sack
packs quite a lot of nice items but of
course really thin and lightweight items
as well so I've got a few really lovely
day dresses I've got a pair of white
jeans because they're just super super
practical and they go with so many tops
I've also got a beach cover-up a blue
and white striped top from where the
island
a pair of really lightweight trousers
which are Flair's high-waisted flares
but again they just fold up to next to
nothing so that's really handy and then
I've got three different best tops two
white and one blue again these are
really good for mixing and matching
different outfits I'm also taking a pair
of denim shorts this top which you've
probably seen in lots of my recent vlogs
because it's really nice for pairing
with either white jeans or white shorts
and I've got a pair of white shorts from
Topshop which just look really really
elegant but gained that pack up to next
to nothing I've learned a bit of a clash
I have the shorts which match the top
that I'm wearing now I haven't taken the
tiger off them yet they're brand new and
these are just a really flattering the
high waist short design which again just
collapse to a really really tiny size
I always feel like I'm so much more
productive with my hair tied up so I'm
just gonna get my hair at my face
okay I feel like I look like a
schoolteacher now but never mind that
let's move on the next thing in this
little section is my emergency kit and
this is kind of a mix between first-aid
and things which I will probably just be
looking for throughout the trip so I've
got a packet of tissues in here I've got
some hand sanitizing gel I've got a
couple of these little I think they're
called rescue bombs from Neal's Yard one
of them is a calming one and this just
helps you to kind of chill out and fall
asleep and then this one is a soothing
one so this is a good for bruises or if
you have any stings and I've got a
selection of tablets I've got some like
ibuprofen and some flu tablets and also
some strepsils in there I've got some
cotton pads makeup remover wipes some
calming chamomile tea bags because I
tend to get quite stressed and if I have
some chamomile tea it will just chill me
out a little bit well so I got in there
I've got a little emergency sewing kit
and a and a stick for any stainless so
don't know if they have mosquitoes out
there I've never been to California of
course I really don't know but I've got
a little anti mosquito or anti stain
stick as well so that's all in this
little I actually got this from a Kate
Spade sample sale and it's really bright
so easy to find in my suitcase then I
have a sleeping bag liner again I didn't
buy this new in fact I don't think I've
bought anything new apart from the bag
this is the silk sleeping bag liner so
if it's really warm in the evenings I
can just sleep in this and maybe use my
sleeping bag as a mattress to have a bit
more padding or if it's really cold I
can put this inside my sleeping bag and
then if you get hot and sweaty you can
wash this and you don't have to wash
your sleeping bag equally if we stay in
hostels I will probably still sleep in
this just because I don't really like
the idea of sleeping in
Hostel Ben Sheets something that's
really bad but yeah I'm much either
sleeping in something which I know that
I have personally washed myself so
taking this under this pink as well
which is super good
then I'm taking two sets on face wipes I
remember that baby wipes when I was
camping in Tanzania were just the best
thing ever
I had cleaned my body with these I clean
my face with them clean my hands clean
up any spills so Johnson's baby wipes
I'm taking a big pack of those and then
for my face I'm also taking the Clinique
take the day off wipes these come in a
really good seal little packet so they
won't be going dry they're always really
moisturizing so nice to clean my face in
the morning especially if there's no
like nice bathrooms but I can do my full
underling routine these are definitely
the most pampering of all my face wipes
and then lastly in that first section is
all are a few pairs of shoes now I'm
taking these pink ones as my only pair
of heels these tend to go with a lot of
the outfits and I'm taking with me a lot
of my trousers are white and these just
make a fun statement but without being
too clunky and they're not taking up too
much room with my suitcase and then I've
got two pairs of sandals firstly my
river island ones these are lace-up ones
so they always are very comfortable they
stay in place they've got a little bit
of a heel and they're quite smart so I'd
be quite happy like walking around some
small across Santa Barbara wearing these
feeling nice and trendy but still
practical same time and then equally
these ones from Bowden that these are my
compound flip-flops I wore these loads
while we are bike riding in Sicily and I
think biking is something that on our
itinerary for this trip so I thought
these would be really nice for that kind
of activity and moving on to the next
section that the next part of my
suitcase is a lot more full at the
moment I've got a few straggling bits of
clothes in there including another pair
of denim shorts these again I wore a lot
in Sicily they are from Quiz clothing
and it got some really nice embroidery
on them
so a nice bit of detail and then I've
got two pairs of sunglasses I'm taking a
cheaper pair and slightly more luxurious
pair so this is a pair from ki Australia
I wear these all the time
they don't have a lot of knowledge
normally bits they don't have the little
plastic bits here so I can put them on
my head and they don't get caught up and
then I'm also taking this pair from
River Island
they are dupes of the deal sunglasses
and vanila quite cheap so if I'm doing
anything like on the beach and I don't
want to ruin my key ones then I will
wear these the next thing in there is
this little case so in here I have you
know this kind of bits and bobs you
always just have it lurking at the
bottom of your suitcase and you can
never find them when you need them well
I thought I would put them all together
in this so it's another one of these
little bags that came in with my packing
cubes so I ordered five of these packing
cubes from ebay they came as a set of
five and this was the smallest and
inside I've got things like a little
torch that's just a battery-powered
thought I was actually lent this from
choiceless sister who just got back from
then this is great I think she's a
cracker and then I've got a couple of
adapters I'm hoping that's the right
plug for the u.s. I'm pretty sure that's
the right one and also I have my phone
charger and a really big padlock this is
a padlock that I use in the gym and
apparently when you stay in hostels you
sometimes have to put your things in a
locker and it needs quite a big padlock
so I've got my gym padlock with me and
obviously I've been using ace
padlock to lock my case as well also in
this I will put my charges for my camera
um and maybe my laptop if I can fit it
in there but the moment I'm still using
them so there would be some last-minute
additions next we have my beauty bag or
my toiletry bag this one I actually have
more than one bag for my toiletries I'll
go into the next one in a second but
this is a clear case from a brand called
Lolo and inside it firstly I've got my
hairbrush I'm taking this one from the
wet brush or wet wet brush Pro and I'm
just taking this long as it's really
really lightweight its plastic and it's
really easy to comb through my hair when
it's super naughty and then at the top
I've got my first little case from a
brand called lucky and I got two set of
three of these I'm taking all three of
these cases with me this one has got
kind of lightweight stuff in it
including my flannel and some cotton
pads for taking off makeup and the rest
of the contents of this case is my
makeup so this for me is hardly anything
to take with me because basically I've
taken the smallest
of everything that I own is so for
example with my contour blusher and
highlight it's all in this zoeva palette
my eyeshadow is tiny little quad from
Charlotte Tilbury is all that I'm taking
I've got minis of my favorite skin care
like the Estee Lauder finite repair I've
got a mini of that and I basically have
been collecting minis for so long and
have a massive box underneath my bed
full of minis so I've gone through all
my makeup items and taken the travel
size versions where I can and I'm also
packing some really good multitasking
products so this is the Elizabeth Arden
8 hour cream all over miracle oil and
this is such a savior for times when you
just need a little bit of pampering that
don't want to take too much with you so
this can use on the face on the body on
the skin on the hair and it's just such
a good little multitasking product it's
so tiny this version that I've got so
that's definitely count with me
so that's all my makeup in there if you
want to see more detail what's in my
makeup Saticoy Ettore bag then let me
know maybe I'll cover it on snapchat
while I'm out there but just let me know
in the comments if you'd like to see
more and as to what Beauty things I'm
taking with me to track America and then
they all fit inside this case and I
chose the clear one on purpose cuz
really easy for me to see what's inside
so I don't have to really rummage too
much it's quite clear to see where
everything is so the second of these
gorgeous little aqua bags that I just
really love them because they're so
fluid and flexible you can easily shove
them into any gap in your suitcase this
is the largest one I'm taking and inside
here it's more actual toiletries so I've
got things like deodorants and I've got
my portable razor this one is Venus and
he is called a Venus snap but really
handy and razor and then again loads of
travel minis so I'm taking a Kerastase
deep conditioner of course my pure ology
color fanatic you guys know how obsessed
of this I am kind of go anywhere without
it and then I've got a mini mouthwash a
mini dr. Bronner pure castile soap and I
think this is all of these really good
multitasking one so I can clean my body
with it I can clean my clothes so that
you clean your makeup brushes with it so
that's really really handy I'm also
taking the Clarins water comfort
one-step cleanser this is like a mile of
water so all you need to do is pop on a
cotton pad and wipe away your makeup so
really good again if you don't have a
nice bathroom or running water so this
is gonna be great for removing my makeup
then I've also got a mini dry shampoo
I've got a full side
as well but I'll take that if I don't
have enough room I've got another dr.
Bronner product here this is a lavender
organic hand sanitizer I have got a hand
sanitizing gel in my emergency bag but I
think I'll just uses every evening
before my makeup routine and also every
morning because when you're camping is
nice to keep sparrow obviously so yeah
this is a really lovely smelling one and
then annoyingly I have to take the
full-size versions of these because I
don't have any smaller ones I've got my
piss playing effect a 15-10 protect tan
accelerating spray because it is pretty
hot there at the moment and I think the
sun's quite strong so I thought I better
take an SPF with me and then I'm also
taking my Avon Skin So Soft dry oil
spray because this is also an insect
repellent so I'll be spritzing myself
for this every evening before we head
out just to be safe so everything is
zipped up into this bag and I can just
shove this into any available space in
my suitcase the next few things that are
in here are my kind of comfortable
clothes so even though we're gonna be in
a really lovely glamorous place I know
that in the evenings when it gets chilly
I'm just gonna want to be comfy so I'm
taking a few things that are just super
super comfortable the first one is this
jumper it says I'm in it's actually from
a Clarins campaign that they ran a while
ago and they sent me this as well as a
few products so I thought this can kind
of be my chilling in the evening jumper
because it's really big oversize and
it's really soft on the inside as well
then I'm taking some Hotel slippers
these are from this shampoos health spa
and I thought if we're in a hostel
running campsite
I just love to buy slippers all the time
I'm not gonna take my dnews with me so I
thought I would take some Hotel slippers
if I knew them or if I want to leave
them behind afterwards it's no big deal
because these are freebies also taking a
dressing gown this is a pink and white
striking one from Primark because again
I like to cozy in the mornings maybe
when it's just starting to eat
but I want to leave my tents and maybe
run to the bathroom it'll be really easy
for me to oh my god I hope that is a
bathroom maybe there won't be
I don't know but either way when I leave
my tent in the morning I can just put
this around my shoulders
then I've got my pyjamas I'm just taking
an old pair from Jack Wills and his fat
t-shirt so I can switch around my pajama
top and then this is a really soft Remo
vest top from American Eagle I think or
is it Airy swamp area which is the
American Eagle kind of like younger
brand or that lingerie brand and that's
just a really super soft top which again
can be a pajama top or just for chilling
in the daytime top I'm using a dust bag
from a handbag that I bought to keep my
underwear in so I definitely don't want
to have my underwear like floating all
around the case so I put all of my
underwear bras because unlocks all in
this little white bag here to keep all
together and out of sights as well and
then I've also got a pair of flip-flops
these were also sent to me recently
along with a load of things from abroad
so that you've got my Instagram photos
all over them so we know confusing whose
flip-flops ears are they've got my name
on it they've got my Instagram photos on
and yeah I think needs to be really
practical again for just nipping here
and there wearing them on the beach and
yeah
definitely sort of a good idea to take
some flip-flops then I have another
little practical pouch this one has got
my memory card inside it so this is
actually a little jewelry a little
jewelry pouch from a Monica vanator
but I'm using it to store my memory
cards inside and then the other thing in
here is my hard drive so I know it's not
that sort of hard drive this is my
portable phone charger so this is a
solar powered charger it's from a brand
called Sol safe and I can basically hang
this if I want to out of my tent or of
my backpack and it uses solar energy to
power itself and then we can charge my
phone or my batteries from this and it
also doubles up as a torch
the next and this has just been packing
something for major just in case I've
got a waterproof bag so I have no idea
why I own this but I found it in my
beach bag upstairs it says eat I'm on it
does anyone else remember Tammy the shop
that was like around when we were much
younger and this is basically a
completely water resistant bag so if we
do maybe like a boat trip or I don't
know anywhere that I want to have my
phone with me they might get wet then I
all put it in this and it doesn't take
up any room so I thought we had you
stick with me just in case I packed a
little bag of Haribo stomachs because
you never know when you might just
really crave a little bit of sugar so
I've just shove that in there for good
measure I'm also taking a water bottle
this one has my name on it so again
we'll get confused whose it is and this
one was also a freebie I think I got
this in a goodie bag so if I am
struggling for space on the way home if
I bought too much makeup from Sephora
then I can just leave this one behind
look who's come to see me I want to pack
you and missing things
kisses for mommy okay the boys are not
allowed to coming on your seat knees
next I've got another one of these
travel pouches and this one has got my
swimwear inside so who I would collect
all in my snowman together I'm taking
two bikinis and one swimming costume
probably far too many but again I don't
want to risk not having enough swimwear
and yeah I thought they're not taking up
too much space so no harm in taking a
few bikinis and we've got another pair
of sandals these are from Topshop and
they're incredibly comfortable and they
look really nice as well it's like a
mile in a day or in the evening
yeah really comfortable and really
flattering I also recently picked up
this little bag from Topshop so this one
it packs down really flat it's super
thin like another envelope but nice for
day trips if we don't want to take our
big bags or our hand luggage kind of
bags which I'll show you later
with us then I can just put my phone in
my camera and some money and at this one
Dexter it's kind of me getting inside
the suitcase a little sausage little
loud
and then the last couple of pieces I
have this which is called a uni Powell
plus I got this in South Africa when I
lost one of my camera charges and
basically it's like a universal camera
battery charger all kind of all battery
charger so if I do happen to lose any of
my charges or if something breaks or if
anybody forgot to bring my charger then
this is a really good universal charger
for external batteries I'm taking my
favorite pair of sweaty Betty leggings I
think when we do really active days like
lots of walking or biker eyes then these
will be a really nice one to wear I
probably should take another pair of
leggings I feel like we might be doing
that kind of stuff more often than I'm
bargaining for and then my last few
pieces are in another one of these
packing bags I'm not going to go through
this one because it's basically just day
dresses and you've seen a lot of these
before in my lookbook video and in
previous vlogs and you'll see all of
these items in my Trek American vlogs
I'm not going to go through that one and
also it's beautifully packed so don't
want to rummage through that finally
I've got any towel which I've got a
couple of years ago from H&amp;amp;M it's on its
last legs so again I thought if I need
to leave this behind it's not the end of
the world but this will be nice to use
as kind of like a blanket or just use it
as a towel but yeah I thought it would
be really handy to have a proper soft
towel with me as well as my tractor
towel so that is everything that I'm
taking with me in my big bag for track
America I'm yet to actually pack my hand
luggage but I definitely need to go out
and get myself a nice bacon rucksack for
using as my hand luggage on the plane
and also for our day trips because
obviously my little handbag is not going
to be enough for our bike rides and our
tracks
so that's on my shopping list I'm gonna
be wearing a pair of trainers to travel
in and I'm actually leaving behind my
hiking boots I do have a pair of hiking
boots which probably if I had more
luggage allowance would come with me but
yeah I think that I'll be okay with
trainers so fingers crossed because
there's so Mulkey I really do not want
to have to bring my massive boots with
me and the
the things I have got coming is a lovely
straw hat which I've ordered from mango
I believe I actually got it from a sauce
but yeah you guys will see that and all
the other fashion bits and bobs which
I'm probably gonna pick up in town now
on my videos my vlogs and me vlogging
the trip I'm going to be snapchatting
instagramming all of that so guys make
sure you're definitely following me on
snapchat I leave my username here if
you're not following me already because
it's gonna be some really fun snapping
opportunities I'm sure so hope you guys
have enjoyed this video I'm hopefully
Emily publishing this a few days before
I go so if you think I've forgotten
anything
maybe if you've been on check America
yourself then please leave me a note in
the comments because I always have that
fear that I'm forgetting something I
will of course I'm packing my laptop my
camera's my chargers my phone and all
that kind of stuff in my hand luggage so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I can't wait to blog my tricks and I
can't wait to share them with you so
I'll see you very soon and thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
