thought I'd do review video for you it's
coming up to the Keaney weather time
finally I will start to think about the
silly little things like hair removal
and a product that I've been using for
the past few months is this
it's the Philips Lumiere compact system
it's basically a laser hair removal kit
that you do at home and I've now been
using it for the past four months so I
feel like I've been using it for a
sufficient amount of time to keep you
guys a really good review some initial
thoughts on it and of course to find at
the end whether it works or not so the
reason why I wanted to try it was
because there's quite a few downsides to
other methods of hair removal I find
shaving you just have to do it so
regularly and you know it's just really
hard to keep up who's got time for that
not me that's true and then with waxing
I can never do myself at home I can't
get the wax off it has a trick then let
me know but I can't do it at home and
going to someone is kind of expensive so
that's a shame epilating is great if you
can keep it up but you've got to let the
hair get really long and I just don't
want to have long hair for half a month
and also it is so painful I remember the
first time I did it I was almost in
tears epilating yeah it's great it's
long lasting but it hurts so when I
first heard about at home kits for what
later however before I thought it sounds
too good to be true so I couldn't wait
to put it to the test and I'm pleased to
say that off for months I have been
getting some really good results from
the Philip new man so the Philip sumia
is an at home at laser hair removal
intense pulse light hair removal system
and it comes in this box inside the box
you get this amazing little gadget it's
really small it's it just fits in the
palm of your hand so you don't need to
worry about storing it you have to plug
it in when you're using it I think
there's a more expensive version where
you don't have to plug it in but to be
honest the cord is really really long
I've got it plucked in
the wall over there and it's so long
that I don't really see that there's any
downside to it having a plug you can use
it on the underarm area on Keeney line
on the lower leg and even the upper lip
so this one is suitable for on the face
if you didn't want to do hair removal in
that area I personally have just been
using it on the lower leg and the
underarms and as I said I started four
months ago so I feel like now is a
really good time to share my review with
you guys on me back in the box it tells
you all the information about whether
you're suitable so it's definitely worth
checking this out before you go and
spend I think it's 200 pounds on a
product it says that it's not suitable
for really dark skin so if you're really
all of you or if you've got dark skin
then you may not be suitable and it also
potentially doesn't work on gray hair
red hair very very light blonde hair and
say my hair is white light brown I
wouldn't say the hair on my legs
Monroe's blonde but it's been working
for me and the product itself it's got
five different settings on the back so
you've got level 1 2 3 4 &amp;amp; 5 and that's
basically the strength of the light that
will come out of the bottom here I have
to admit I was a little bit nervous when
I first tried it I thought oh my gosh
there's just like zapping light that
comes out the bottom of it I thought it
might be quite painful but I can confirm
it it's 100%
pain free it can give off a little bit
of heat especially if you're going to do
both of your lower legs then it takes
about 15 or 20 minutes so it can get
quite hot but there's absolutely no pain
so if you're thinking about not getting
it because of that don't worry it's
completely pain-free so how does a
Philips Lumia work basically you
obviously have to have it plugged in and
then on the back you've got this button
here and this is not only the on/off
button but also the strength button so
you hold it down and then keep pressing
it in to
the desired strength setting so I've now
got this on level 5 and you can hear
it's making a wearing noise that's
pretty much just the final unit that
keeps it cool nothing scary nothing to
worry about and then on this side you've
got a really big button
so can't miss it and it's this that you
press down when you want to exact the
skin so the first thing you have to do
when you use it is shave your legs and
this for me is the major benefit to the
Philips Lumiere because you don't have
to let your hair grow really long and
basically you have a perfect excuse to
be constantly hair on your legs so step
one is to shave your legs one little
trick that I have started doing when I
use the Philips Linea is to take a white
eyeliner pencil to just draw some
guidelines on my leg because you don't
want to zap the same area twice so if
you make some guidelines with you could
use any kind of eyeliner just a cheap
one not waterproof might be hard to get
off but if you use something to just
remind yourself where you've already
zapped then it's so here you can see
I've just turned on a Philips oomiya and
I'm drawing one long white line down the
front of my leg and I'm going to start
by just holding down the button in the
middle if you keep holding it down as
you move the little zap when it gets to
the next area automatically so you don't
have to worry about keeping on pressing
it
and then when first line of hair removal
is done I just draw a line to remind
myself where I've done and then we found
the next section
so I guess what you guys really want to
know is does it work well I've been
using it for four months now and within
the first um the first two months when
you have to use the Philips Lumiere
every two weeks I'd say I noticed that
my hair is getting a lot finer and there
would be certain parts which were
completely hair free but now four months
later I find I really don't need to
shave my legs very often I tend to only
shave just before using the Phillips
Lumiere which I do now every month just
as like a top-up I wouldn't say I'm
completely bowled like I'm not going to
be never touching a razor again but it's
definitely a lot lot lot better I think
now I would be confident in just putting
on a skirt
and not having to worry like oh my god
did I shave my legs because they're
pretty much mostly have free most of the
time and the best thing of course is so
it's it's permanent its long-lasting and
yeah it's just amazing so I'd say the
pros of using a Philips amia are of
course that it's pain-free waxing
epilating they are not they're like
excruciating or as a Philips umeå is
completely pain-free so it's definitely
a bonus also the fact that it's long
lasting you really just don't have to
worry about having hairy legs when
you're using the Philips Lumiere which
for me is just another load off my mind
it's far less expensive than loads of
hair removal treatments if you're going
to go to a salon and get this done
professionally I think it could cost you
like well over 600 pounds so if you have
this then it's going to save you loads
and loads of money even waxing can be
expensive and epilate is expensive you
get a decent quality one and even with
shaving the cost of constantly buying
razors I mean they're not cheap so this
is actually when you think about it
really good value for money the
negatives are the initial expense to in
Japan still cheap for any kind of hair
removal system so it's not cheap as a
one-off and then I would also point out
but it's quite hard to stick to the
routine in the first
and once we really do have to do it
every two weeks I set a note in my diary
every other Monday after on the Monday's
of the days that's most likely to be at
home I just stick mode and Chelsea on or
something and zap away of my legs so I'd
say that sticking to the routine is this
bit of a calm but on the negative yeah
it's not that big a deal so I hope that
you found this review and video useful I
hope that maybe I'll give me some more
information if you were thinking about
splashing out on a fillip sea mirror or
any kind of home hair removal system
I've not tried any others I don't think
I will I don't think I need to sound
more than happy with this if you did
find this video useful and keys please
give me a thumbs up and if you would I
need to review any other kind of
products then yeah let me know in the
comments below thanks guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
