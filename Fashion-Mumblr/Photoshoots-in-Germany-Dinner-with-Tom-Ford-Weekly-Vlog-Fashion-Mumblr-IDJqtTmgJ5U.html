vlog of 2016 I'm starting this vlog in a
hotel room I'm currently in Hamburg in
Germany and I'm here with Schwarzkopf
despite what my hair is looking like
right now still need to brush that I'm
about to go and meet them still a couple
of days of photo shooting so yeah that
should be really really good fun and I
thought I would vlog it my first vlog of
the year I'm gonna try and do weekly
vlogs most weeks throughout the year um
so yeah kicking it off now I didn't
start before now because I had a bit of
camera trouble and one a different
camera today so hopefully it's okay and
the quality is good I feel like it's
more HD than my Olympus and you can see
exactly how shiny I am also seem to have
picked up a little bit of a cold so
sorry if I sound a little bit fluey
Charlie has had man flu for the past
four days or so some probably finally
picking up a little bit of that and yes
I am currently wearing a thermal top
because I think it's pretty cold outside
but just Economist a bit of knitwear and
walk to the photo studio and walk to the
photo location it is half-past seven on
a Sunday morning but yeah we are up
bright and early despite the fact that I
had about three hours sleep because I
spent all night on a sauce like buying
random stuff which I probably need to
send back because they know shopping is
never a good thing and also randomly I
just kept watching people's 25 facts
about me or 55 facts about me videos I
watched my friend Hannah's and then I
just started watching everybody's and
then I decided I wanted to do once I
start to write down facts so yeah didn't
get much sleep but anyway go to - now so
let's go get this show on the road so
I'm just here
my salon in Hamburg which is only in
Tomatoes out which is great and we just
started to do the first look which is a
kind of I think they called it on the
table or some kind of loose side right
although I've just messed it up majorly
which is I'm not good they have just
done a little tutorial video and a few
photos using of this bad boy which is
and there sometimes these all spray so
got his pink packaging there goes me
it's comfy but very important but yeah I
think we're gonna take this out now I've
already mastered hope that they said and
do the next look which I think actually
is this dummy over here look at this so
this is the next hairstyle that I meant
to be creating but they've got to teach
me how to do it event apparently myself
so
every time
they were just about to wrap things up
here at the salon I'm really annoyed my
battery actually died when we were doing
the last look and it was by far my
favorite but hopefully we managed to get
a little bit on my phone and there's a
really nice like a straight hair star
which I absolutely not and all the
photos are really energetic after it
like jumps and flipping my hair back
cause we got hopefully the photos are
very well it 8 o'clock in evenings or
footpath now and so we've now been in
the salon for 12 hours
there really long day we're about to now
which is very well
yeah just waiting with everybody else to
finish up
I've just seen mine looks for tomorrow
which on the moon boys let's have a look
so looks like I'll be doing this is the
one I showed you on the mannequin
earlier with the plats and then the fun
and then we've got a loose braided
half-up half-down which looks quite nice
and then kind of Beach the festival a
side braid which looks lovely as well
it's beautiful
another view on the lake there is our
food at Cafe de Perry in Amburg landings
menu every day and I have got comfy
dusters and Rijo prepare and square
chips on so day two of shootings days of
back into epsilon I'm feeling a little
hip quality and sorry for myself to take
off every block knows and every time we
take a photo I have to get my makeup
redone because my nose is really red
about really cool hair still at the
moment I'm going to try and show you my
packing ups at the mirror
so it's got kind of like oh my god so
we've got kind of like a big French plat
going on
which I could not do myself so we had a
little sneaky behind-the-scenes kind of
filming but now we're going to take some
photos of undoing it as though we were
doing it if have myself my brain isn't
working I'm full of those so yeah we're
going to do that learn how wash and look
how cool is this another behind the
scenes photo that's really good
hey guys so sorry for lack of vlogging
today but basically things got really
really hectic towards the end and I feel
like absolute poo I didn't really feel
like vlogging and then I had about five
minutes in which to do a final photo
shoot before homes leave for the airport
I'm just literally ran them through
security have a skip all the queues and
now I have five minutes to get to gate
so them yeah push me up so I'm finally
back home now I'm sorry I was a bit
rushed in the airport and didn't really
talk to you that much but yeah was
running to catch the flight which I made
thankfully obviously otherwise I
probably wouldn't be here and as you
might be able to hear I'm a little bit
bummed up and my nose is so red and dry
from all the nose blowing um and yeah a
little bit gross so I think I'm gonna
head pretty much straight to bed and
Charlie bless him has made me like a
little ill pamper routine set here he's
got me a nice lip balm MacLaren's and
moisture of punishing balm he's got out
all the soil which I'm gonna cover all
over a tissue and then a nasal spray
which is really really sexy and then
some vicks vapor rub which I'm just
going to smother all over myself right
now
Dexter is chewing something under the
bed which probably means he's doing
something low but no DS I better rescue
him and but yeah as this is a weekly
vlog I'm gonna carry on the vlog as your
pretty girl to see from the timeline
you're only probably about halfway
through it now so yeah I've got some fun
things on on Thursday or maybe Wednesday
and Friday I think there's a couple of
fun things going on this week so I'm
gonna stop rambling go to bed and see
you in a couple of days because
tomorrow's gonna be really boring but
anyway
hey guys so today's now it's not
Thursday at this moment which is amazing
which is beautiful
I'm back home again now I was meant to
stay in town a little bit longer for a
couple of events but I feel like poo so
I thought I'd come back and try and
recover a little bit because I've got
dinner tonight
and I want you feeling really good for
the dinner so I thought I'd come home
and try and recuperate a little bit but
yeah had a really nice breakfast at duck
and waffle and it was actually quite
clear outside and I had chorizo like
every whether there was Sun there was
fog there was right now and even snow at
one point so ISM yeah it's a really nice
breakfast I had the duck and waffle
because what else can you have Dexter
knows a bit chewing a same sweet bag so
yeah that was really nice and then I met
up with Joe who is an incredible
photographer he shoots for quite a lot
of girls blogs and he is the boyfriend
of a blogger /youtube what Olivia did
and he's just really nice guy takes
super photos so he had a couple of shots
and had a couple of outfits with him and
yeah so productive morning I'm back home
now with my little mischief maker over
there he's looking for trouble and I
just went to Donald as well they've got
a little bit more post and so yeah I'm
gonna have a little look through that
one of the things that the girls gave me
am I meeting first thing was like a
satin satin I think it's called like an
iron if I on the dicing hairbrush and
the party it stops frizz so I'm gonna
try that out now because it sounds too
good to be true and you know how I love
to put these things to the test so let's
give that a whirl so this is the
hairbrush it's the bronze satin hair 7
and this one's got the nice natural
bristles so a bit more like a normal
hair brush I'm going to open this up and
see if it actually does get rid of
static let's give it a go first of all
I'm really amazed at the instruction
manual obviously this is like a hundred
different languages but I mean this is a
hairbrush so this is kind of crazy let's
try and find the English section so we
start by sliding that on and apparently
that's it
so I guess I just brush my hair with it
my hair is really really Nazi so I'm
just giving it and giving a good
challenge oh I can hear it like fussing
well as far as the hairbrush goes it's
doing a good job actually to know what
normally when I brush my hair after
being out all day it's pretty afro so
maybe this actually works Wow
I'm quite impressed so I'm actually
pretty impressed with it I'm considering
I've been out in like the wind and the
rain and I didn't actually blow dry my
hair probably this morning I just went
straight in with the colors I think it's
done a pretty good job at D frizzing my
hair normally when I brush my hair and
after I've curled it it just kind of
goes flyaway crazy but it seems to be
pretty Flyway fries so I'm gonna keep on
using it maybe next time I'll do it on
one side and not the other good what do
you think of all those instructions no
man do you know how to use it so just
opening up some post and I've got a
natural detox kit from Neal's Yard
remedies and they've sent this nice
detox oil which apparently is a
stimulating blend of lemon black pepper
frankincense and other essential oils
apparently good for fatty areas so I'll
be giving that a go and then we've got a
cleansing aromatherapy blend and I have
been really getting into using these
oils in what you call them those I can't
think of the word those ceramic things
oil burners yeah so I'm gonna give that
one a go later some chia seeds which I
didn't actually know why they were good
for you but apparently she is really
good at making you feel fuller for
longer so I need to stop putting those
in my morning smoothies
speaking of smoothies I just went to
roots and bulbs on my way back from the
photo shoot with Jo and they didn't know
how many bananas left so he actually
gave me a my smoothie for free which was
amazing and then Nils you out of also
put in a superfood organic greens
complex with purifying chlorella which
apparently is detoxifying antioxidant
good for the gut brain muscle building
and you can add the juice and smoothies
so lovely little detox
it from Neal's Yard I've really been
getting into Neal's Yard recently and
I've just remembered I've got a tea
downstairs one of their organic humming
ones which is probably getting cold
here it is
that's kind of the perfect temperature
yeah I find one of these just makes
makes me so much more chilled out like I
get really stressing Lee and I feel like
I've got so much to do and not enough
time but if I have one of these it just
chills me out I think somebody might
want to play
he's got my bra the dryer let go you
Tara let go sorry for not much logging
this afternoon I just kind of got
cracking um with a load of work so
nothing that you really wanted to see
and but I have done my hair and makeup
not really happy with my hair it's a
little bit weird and I can't do much
with it but I'm heading out now to
dinner at the court with Tom Ford which
should be really really nice let me
quickly show you what I'm wearing so I
wasn't really in the mood for a dress I
think it's getting quite smart so I've
put on this kind of kimono top from
River Island and then my faux leather
leggings which are from Zara and they're
this nice kind of like pinky beige color
and then I've got my Valentino shoes on
this new watch also arrived in the post
today it's a brand called clue I don't
know why it's not focusing they get kind
of in focus there but it's got a nice
grey strap which pretty much matches my
leggings so really like that um yeah
hair makeup I use pretty much all Tom
Ford makeup for this look because I did
have a Tom Ford yay so let's go
dog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
