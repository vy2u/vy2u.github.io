lovely day
today's video is a little bit more
relaxed than my normal videos and I'm
wearing my super comfy clothes I'm
wearing this jumper which is my jumper
which I went on to be comfy it's quite
cold today and gloomy I'm really tired
from the as darkness falls party last
night which was so much fun I've logged
it so I'll leave the link down below so
foolish want to watch it so under-eye
situation is not looking good why don't
you comfy I'm usually much houses as
well he's uh boo boo
these are some Jack Wills pretty cozy
things so yeah quite relaxed video but a
fun one because I've been shopping I
have been to Primark and you stick stuff
stop chewing on the pumpkins
ah not part of the whole because I got
these from Waitrose I'm also filming
like a deck or video and somebody likes
to shred them and yes and I also went to
hmm because they have got their autumn
slash beginning of Christmas home things
in which we mostly rose gold so
naturally I a little bit spendy so let's
see what it picks up which we start with
hi Marco hmm I actually like hmm things
best so I'm going to start with that
because I actually can't remember
exactly what I thought so you can't have
a look inside that is that is from the
hmm ball main launch event which I went
to which came with a 50 pound battering
the goodie bag so that's kind of another
reason why I got a bit spendy
and I also flocked about the launch
actually I think that may even mean the
same vlog as the the darkness falls
party so yeah have a little look at that
vlog if you want to see hmm Batman
preview and the dark missiles party so
on
I promise no matter whether vlog anymore
so first thing that I've got from H&amp;amp;M
are two sets of two sets of paper paper
paper marks baking paper cups a squash
community today two sets of paper cups
and these are white with little gold and
rose gold kind of
stars on them which are really pretty
and they match they match these plates
which obviously I also bought two sets
of so I think I have 216 of everything
in total no 10 perc 10 yeah 10 pack so
I've got 20 of everything in total which
is really good the monks of $2.99 for 10
and solar plates and I thought we
haven't actually got any Christmas
parties planned but we normally end up
having loads of people around just for
Christmas drinks and nibbles I just had
a panic that I wasn't filming because on
my Olympus the red button is and down in
that corner and I was like no I've just
done the whole intro not filmed it but
it's up there it's fine panic not so
gold Christmas and crockery you call it
crockery paper crockery party plates
party crockery today um yeah I got these
so as I said in total 3 6 9 12 12 pounds
for 20 persons worth of paper crockery
next up from H&amp;amp;M is this lovely pink and
white blanket I just I thought this
would be really cozy and lovely friend
allow enjoy in the bedroom and our old
blanket was a big purple fluffy one and
we donated that to Dexter because we
thought he might be getting a bit cold
at night so would you want to use that
one after I've been in his bed and this
is really really really big a lot bigger
actually than I thought it was going to
be and it's so it goes white light pink
dark pink light pink or white so it's a
lovely pattern really soft I'm going to
check the fabric contents I can't really
tell what it is made in China use fabric
softener 100% acrylic so it's gonna wash
quite well as well I was a bit worried
that if it were had wool or cashmere in
it which obviously it wouldn't at that
price which was $24.99 that it would get
matted it's acrylic so which means it's
washable and so soft and I love these
colors and they're beautiful so I'm
really really pleased with that one ah I
just got really worried because I knew
that I bought two um glass canister
items
see one pushes put one inside the other
which is very clever of her I also have
a bit of an embarrassing situation in
the shop so boys I'm not allowed to
shred not nice boy
so had a bit of an embarrassment
situation in the shop before I went
shopping I went to an afternoon tea
launch of the Samson hotel which they do
the Mad Hatter's Tea Party and it was so
much fun and opposite us was Lily
pebbles Viviana Ruth and Caroline Heron
sirens camera inherence you guys know
who I mean um and I've made them all
before but I just do it you want to go
up and say hi because it's like I don't
want to be like hi Richard you know we
know each other but you would run for me
it was a bit awkward and then I bumped
into me and Anna in hmm then and hmm
didn't take my Amex so I had to leave my
stuff at the till and lily and Anna most
women like oh she can't afford to buy it
to them but actually I just had to go to
the cash point so stop chewing sounds a
bit embarrassing but back to these so I
picked up two gas canisters this is the
first one and it's got this gorgeous no
naughty it's got this gorgeous rose gold
triangular graphic kind of print on it
which is really restarting and it
beautifully catches the light even in
here I thought we might spin in the shop
but I was the young spotlights on it but
looks beautiful here not too sure what
I'm gonna do with it might use it as a
floral and Vaz I guess it looked quite
nice flowers in yeah or to be honest it
looks really nice on its own because as
I said it catches light and looks
beautiful I also have somewhere on the
floor probably a load of pine cones that
you've collected for an autumn deck or
video which I'm planning and so yeah I
might Phyllis's scented pine cones or
something love you like that I also got
another one which is in here and this is
very similar but the pattern is slightly
finer if you can see that it's more of
an outline something together they look
really beautiful and the smaller one was
$12.99 and this one was
$17.99 so really not bad I think if
you're gonna go to a garden
Center and get as far as this pretty
you'd spend a lot more money so I'm
really pleased with those two what do
you think Dexter I don't know I just
have been Munchkins I just noticed that
the inside is kind of silvery so I think
this will be really nice if you like to
put like pinecones and fairy lights
inside already distant in some way might
try that out unless everything that I
got from H&amp;amp;M or not not too many items
but it feels like quite a nice little
haul you know I thought I would share it
with you Oh actually I did go to hmm um
about a week before that so I thought
I'd show you you want to know
everybody's real eyes haven't actually
unpacked it yet I think this is from
Primark yeah it is it's in the H&amp;amp;M back
where this is a candle this is Dexter
stop it you're being very naughty look
what he's done at the corner of my board
shredded naughty boy this is the
nectarine and lemon blossom scented
candle which apparently burns up to 30
hours as it's recording yeah I'm really
worried and this is 2 pounds and it
smells incredible it's not like a it's
not like a really luxurious expensive
kind of smell but it's a really nice
smell and you know what I actually find
that cheaper candles smell better and
stronger than more expensive ones and
one of my friends Rory who it just he
knows everything about everything is one
of these people he was telling me that
actually the higher quality candles more
expensive ones use this is right you saw
wax which is actually better for you and
you breathe it in because it doesn't
hold on to the dust particles new air or
something and so soy candles are better
for you but the higher quality wax
doesn't contain paraffin no this is
right or as much paraffin and the
paraffin is what makes the candles smell
nice so keep ones smell nice but they're
not as good for you to breathe in
something along those lines but two
pounds smells nice that's a good one
Primark oh so I must have been thinking
the same thing when I went in last week
I had such a bad memory so this is
another set of cups these ones one mine
Stein's a little bit cheaper also pack
of 10 oh and they say party and sweets
they're quite cute and I picked up a
stoked
this has got gold pump yeah pump that's
the word I think we all put this one in
our downstairs bathroom because we've
got like a marbly one at the moment but
it's looking a little bit worse for wear
so might replace that with this one
I was $7.99 which is quite expensive
actually for Primark home next to no
he's chewing everything and lastly from
your end
do you mind no we need to give you
something the last thing that I picked
it up from hmm last week was this bowl
and this is kind of marble around the
outside and it was only $6.99 I thought
was really cute and then picked up
basically because it was marble I think
this could be something for it and maybe
dexter's water to be honest I think
that's why I picked it up and yeah very
chic dog bowl or you could use it to
store your jewelry or never new shares
or perfumes but yeah cute little marble
bowl on to Primark so much Primark um
actually I went into Primark after went
into each gnome because I was like oh I
am in the mood for buying home things
let's see what Primark have and and they
had started to bring out their Christmas
collection so the first thing I spotted
and this is obviously a wreath that goes
you can put around your door you can
prop it up on your mantelpiece which i
think is probably know which I think
it's probably what I will do and it's
not centered no it's not centered I
think this shop area was centered from
all the candles I thought it was
centered when I bought it but this was 7
pounds which is so good you will look
anything that's cheap and garden centers
or wherever you normally buy Christmas
decorations it's got lots of pinecones
some little wooden stars and wooden
twigs and then gold glitter all around
it so very simple very pretty and it
doesn't look doesn't thing like a tacky
decoration like Primark you could be in
danger of some of the decorations being
a little bit tacky but this isn't this
is lovely and love this so also on the
pinecone theme I picked up this which is
a box of 10 sparkly pinecones
I picked this up to mix in with my
normal pinecones I've been collecting
some while out on walks because it's
nice to like make your own potpourri and
how some kind of DIY ish autumnal things
which is as I said I've been packing a
video for so if it's out by the time you
see this I'll link it down below so I
think it should be a nice one but this
was ten for two pounds they must be
making a killing out of this because
they are just things that are picked up
from nature covered in gold but hey ho I
don't have the time to spray-paint pine
because girls I've bought them 50 pounds
I think I always think I'm so critical
with shops like I always think how much
profit they're making and if I feel like
I'm being too ripped off and I won't buy
it maybe that's my fashion degree coming
back to haunt me I think when you do
fashion Meneely it changes the way you
shop I don't go shopping like I used to
I'm always thinking about the psychology
of shopping like oh they don't have a
heater here to keep me warm they have a
heat here to make me aware that I'm in a
short but not on the street anymore
sorry interesting actually if you are
interested in the psychology of fashion
and the little tricks that shops play on
us when we go shopping which are there
are quite a lot actually it's really
interesting there's a book which I
recommend everybody called why we buy by
Paco Underhill and it's a good read I'd
say it's not a good it's not like him
like a chiclet or anything it's an
educational book but it's really
interesting if you like shopping and you
want to be more aware of the tricks that
retailers play on you I like the markups
and everything and yeah this is really
good but anyway that was better than a
ramble so I always think about his
tactics am I going to Primark because
Primark are the king of using the
tactics of making you spending money
that's the next thing I bought was this
and this is a ginormous blanket or eise
i hope it's journalist haven't actually
taken it out of the the ribbon yet but
it's really silky soft if you guys have
felt that material that's lots of
dressing yarns are made out of that's
just almost so soft that it could be
like not even real you know doesn't even
feel like fabric it's so soft this is
what this is made out of and i think
it's um looks like a kind of zig zaggy
originally oh and it's got like a plain
fleecy lining on the other side so this
was this was twelve pounds which is
pretty good
gonna get out so I can see how big it is
I really like the color of this I think
it's very neutral it can go and lots of
rooms in my house whether it's the
lounge or the bedrooms yeah this is
going to be super snuggly in winter so
now I have two two throws I have this
one and the MLS one Miami nest hmm
Dexter likes it too is coming on to it
for dear life money yes oh except it's
molting oh gosh it's really molting
that's what you get when you pay 12
pounds for throw so I need to shape that
outside and put it to the side there
white dog from all the hair and then the
last few things I got from Primark or
all I want to say boring but they're
that they're the least exciting of the
bunch got a candle this is quite plain
candle this was 2050 and it says large
pillar candles 70 hours burn times
that's pretty good burn time I don't
think it's scented maybe very very
lightly no that is not a toy
and basically I'm planning on doing some
kind of DIY with this maybe sticking
some cinnamon sticks on it or putting it
in the middle of a table centerpiece and
putting some cones around it but again I
will be doing that in my water with a
deck or video and then while I was in
the candle mood the whole candle area
just smelt so good although this one
scented but this is just tea light so I
picked up these two candles this one was
two pound fifty and this is the one that
has the winter berry scent in it and the
jar is just really lovely as well I
think for two pounds fifty you wouldn't
even normally find a jar this cute so
I'm really pleased with that one and
then just to add a bit of height
variation on Mike handle shellfish just
in the lounge in general I've got this
one just a normal tea light holder and
this was one pound fifty and I think
they both they catch the light
beautifully and they're not too festive
so they can stay in the house all year
round so really really pleased with
those so that's it that's everything and
I feel like I've picked up some really
nice pieces like
ginormous haul I'm really happy with
everything that I picked up I just
genuinely really liked all of these
products so I hope you've hairy mouth so
I hope you guys have enjoyed this video
this little man has certainly enjoyed it
because he's been shredding everything
what did it but in your mouth he ate a
live wolf yesterday was so worried about
him um yeah I hope you've not found this
video too casual as I said I just wanted
it to be quite relaxed because I am in
that kind of mood at the moment haven't
even used any heat products on my hair
today this is what happens when I get
out the shower and don't brush it yeah
so quite relaxing for more hope you guys
