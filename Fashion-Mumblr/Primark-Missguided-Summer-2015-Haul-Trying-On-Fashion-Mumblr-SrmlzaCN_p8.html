today's video today I'm going to be
doing a Primark and misguided shopping
haul I've got a couple of summer trips
coming up seven doing a little bit of
holiday shopping and yeah I thought I
would share it all with you
anybody that knows me well will be like
Josie you doing a Primark haul that is
so not you and I have to admit that I am
previously or have previously been a
little bit snobby when it comes to
Primark I have never really shopped in
there before yeah I said I have never
shopped in Primark before so this is
actually not only my first Primark haul
video but my first ever Primark haul
slash Primark shopping trip ever before
I kind of thought it was time that I
discovered Primark because so many of
the girls that I've been hanging around
with recently have had the coolest
things I'm talking about bags
accessories clothing and I've been like
where is it from and they've said it was
Primark and I just thought it was about
time that I got in on some action so
without further ado it's my oh okay so I
bought some clothing and accessories and
home wear but I'm going to start with
clothing first thing I'm not going to do
in any order just however I pull it out
the bag first thing I picked up were
these trousers they are this check print
which I was seeing everywhere last
autumn I think whistles had a really
lovely pair that I nearly bought but
they were just too expensive but this
pair was let's see this was 12 pounds so
I mean even if I only wear these a
couple of times I think it's really
really super value for money and they
don't feel poor quality or anything like
I thought they would be from Primark so
really looking forward to wearing these
there's also this pair of trousers now
these I think we're going to really nice
holiday trousers they're really lovely
light material almost kind of like a
linen me cotton but they're not linen
because they've been in this bag for a
few days now and they're not crease tops
they can't be linen and they've got an
almost kind of tie style what's this
called it's got certain
remember this pan and also cuffed hands
so they're going to be a nice loose fit
whether I'm going on a walk or maybe for
traveling so yeah lovelies then there's
also this classic kind of white t-shirts
a lovely almost CREP kind of material
and it just looks really high-quality
and it's got a lovely gold button on the
back to close it I'm not going to wear
this with the trousers but they were and
they were styled together so yeah I just
picked that one up - these are a pair of
jean bottoms they're really really
lovely light materials so I think I
might take these on holiday with me
because I don't like sleeping bare legs
just in case there's any mosquitoes or
anything in the room but you could lean
normal pajama bottoms are just too heavy
but these are really light fabric and
they've got little deer and some bird
patterns on them so really pretty and
they've got this bow fastening at the
top but it doesn't do anything it's just
kind of a ribbon sewn on for good
measure but they're really really cute
so love those also something that I will
be wearing on a holiday I picked up this
captain it's very see-through material
so you have to make sure you're wearing
a nice bikini underneath it was only ten
pounds so I think it's absolutely
perfect whether you wear it for just one
holiday or keep it for multiple whole
days to come I don't know how long these
pieces will last so that's gonna be the
true test but it's also got these
adorable little bubbles on it I'm not
sure if you can see the bubble detail
but I think kind of obsessed with these
not many pom poms recently so I'm really
glad that I saw this and this was yeah
10 pounds so that's amazing
also when I'm either at home in the
summer or in warmer countries I like to
have I always like to put a dressing
gown on but obviously not the big kind
of typical fluffy dressing gowns that we
normally wear in the UK so I saw this
one in Primark and it's a lovely white
kind of lacy
you commonly see it very well but it's
got a lovely lace finish on the sleeves
and also along the neckline and it's got
a tie waist
playing white and this was eight pounds
I mean it's just the lightest material
so ideal for just nipping to get some
breakfast or pop me out to get a cup of
tea or something
so definitely taking this long ladder
with me okay so I knew Primark was chief
but I wasn't not quite expecting
how cheap everything would be these
flip-flops guess how much these
flip-flops worth they were one pound I
was just absolutely blown away I'm
really loving this almost blue
Mediterranean II kind of tile print
recently I think everybody is it seems
to be everywhere I saw these and it made
me think of that print and I mean there
are pound so I'm not expecting them to
last hugely long in fact I've just
noticed that the actual flip flop bit is
all twisted around here so maybe I've
got a dodgy pair maybe I need to know
okay I fix it but yeah these are really
really cute and a patent so you just
can't go wrong with flip-flops for a
pound there's just a couple more fashion
pieces in here I picked up these
sunglasses I did not need any more
sunglasses but I just can't resist it
when I see it really cute pair these are
only two pounds and they've got a really
kind of beautiful tortoiseshell but
almost kind of more leopardy style very
see-through bit on the top and a skull
detail in between the lenses so these
are really pretty I'll definitely be
taking these to Corfu and these will be
the type of sunglasses that I'm just
keeping my handbag I won't be too upset
if they get broken and because they were
yeah there were two pounds but it's
always useful to have a pair of
sunglasses in your bag so you just can't
go wrong with them perfect and lastly on
the Primark fashion front there is this
handbag it's got this cute little metal
v detail not really sure I'm going to
keep in it it's a great size for holiday
evenings you can pop your phone it's lip
gloss I don't know whatever you want to
carry around in your handbag tiny tiny
little bag but you don't carry much
unheard in the evenings this is fun oh
and I've just noticed this bracelet you
forgot about this bracelet but this was
one pound fifty it's got two kind of
metal stick bits on it I'm not really
sure how to describe it my thing this
could be quite cool as like an upper arm
cuff I've never really tried that style
out before but for one pound 50 it's the
perfect opportunity to try it two pounds
for these two necklaces as well again
what about these so the fashion keeps on
coming but these are silver and gold
and there's a V and also these two just
angry ones I think you can probably wear
them separately I'm just trying to see
how many fastenings there I think it
might just be one but I think this will
look really lovely againts tan skin with
two contrasting muscles and it was also
a pound for these neon friendship braces
I will probably just pile them all on
myself because I'm not showing with my
friends but hugely appreciate 20 pieces
with a friendship bracelet I'm just
joking but they yeah I think they look
really really nice when I'm tanned
I'll just layer them all up and on with
my watch and some gold jewelry or
something I think they look really
pretty
and then I just saw these hair bubbles
all of these for a pound they don't have
any metal in them which is amazing
because I hate heavy walls that have
metal in because I find it really scrubs
up my hair so yep got all these hair
balls for a pound I picked up this set
of four travel bottles it was also a
pound I think yeah one pound for these
for travel bottles so you've got the two
that are kind of a shampoo and
conditioner and then the little pot here
the little round you can get them in
Muji as well but pretty way more
expensive
I'll pray put on moisturizer or like a
night cream in this and then this is a
pump bottle so what I might do with this
one is just use it for on the beach put
some water NYX I like to just spray my
face when I'm on the beach because
otherwise I overheat and it's even
common with a little one of these called
a little funnel so it makes it so much
easier to put your cosmetic sentence so
propellant I think this is amazing I got
this sharpener also a pound it's got a
big section on the little section I can
never find my sharpener so half of my
eyeliners and lip liners are just blunt
at the moment because I'm too lazy to go
and buy a sharpener so I sell this for a
pound and I grab that and then Charlie
and I and our friends we're going to
Ascot later in the year
Royal Ascot has just been but we are
going to go to King George weekend which
is a lot more chilled and you can also
take your own picnic in that so I bought
a couple of picnic things from Primark
wasn't expecting to see this but the
cups were a pound for eight so I picked
up two sets of cups some paper straws to
me these are normally really expensive
and to be honest and not cheap one pound
fifty to twenty four straws but normally
they're way more expensive and they
match the cups so love those and some
plastic cutlery essential right there
twenty four pieces for two pounds
anything that's bad at all and yeah who
wants to take home dirty cutlery after a
picnic so plastic is the way and that's
it my mark bag is empty so that's it
before my Primark haul as I said that
was my first ever trip to Primark so if
you're wondering why I included pouring
things like hair bubbles it's because it
was my first over time that I've never
stopped up on that sort of stuff before
I also went to the Primark autumn in 215
pressed day last week or earlier this
week actually and oh my gosh I am so
impressed by the kind of things they
have in now I was just not expecting to
see all these beautiful pieces ever at
the moment is obsessed with the Chloe
tree bag and they hash I could you perf
at with the beautiful tassels and I
already blogged about it so I'll leave a
link to that blog post down below so if
you want to see my favourite pieces from
the primer autumn winter press day then
you can have a little look and then I
also made some purchases from misguided
and also kind of in the holidays swing
of things so I picked up firstly this
pink top and it's kind of like a crop
top it's also got these not not pom-poms
but tassels on the sleeves so I'm really
loving this kind of effect at the moment
I think I'll need to where I was
something quite high waisted on the
bottom because I don't really like to
have my tummy button showing but this
doesn't say the price but I don't think
it was terribly expensive I think I'll
have to be quite careful this doesn't
crease too much because I think it is a
slightly more delicate fabric but I
absolutely love this color and then
something which does have the cute
little pom-poms is this pair of shorts
these are just really nice light cotton
shorts so perfect for sticking on over
kini bottoms when you're going for lunch
or just in the evenings but yeah really
cute really simple holiday basic and yep
love those and this is my favorite piece
which I got from misguided it's a summer
dress which I'll definitely be wearing
over a bikini it's got this beautiful
cutout section in the mid
where it's almost like a lacy crochet in
fact quite short so it kind of looks
like to mid to top of thigh area it's
definitely not something I'd wear around
like in the UK but on holiday when I've
got tanned legs and everyone's wearing a
little bit less clothing this is going
to be a favorite this summer I can
already tell it's a really lovely fit
it's got adjustable straps at the back
so I actually just need to shorten these
a little bit and yeah it's just really
really beautiful light material and
scrunch it up it's not going to crease
and absolutely love this one so that's
it they are the products I've been
picking up recently from Primark and
misguided I really hoped you enjoyed
looking through them with me I
definitely enjoyed shopping I feel like
I've discovered a new thing here and
hopefully they'll be more Primark calls

some way that they're going to lure you
