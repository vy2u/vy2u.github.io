something a little bit different
something that haven't done before and
it is a product empties video when I
first started watching YouTube videos I
thought that product empties videos are
just the weirdest thing ever because why
would you want to look through
essentially if someone's been but then I
thought that as a beauty vlogger it's
really the mark of a fantastic product
if you finish it completely haven't been
vlogging for nearly two years now I have
cupboards and cupboards full of beauty
products it is my passion that I love to
buy beauty products I'm really lucky
that I also get center view beauty
products so if I finish something then
it's a really really good sign that it's
a fantastic product so for the past a
month I have just been storing empty
products in this little bag here which
I've stored next to my bin so we are
just gonna have a look like rummage
through this bag before I get started I
just want to say a quick thank you to
Appleyard who kindly sent me this
beautiful bunch of flowers and they've
given a discount code so if you would
like to get a bunch of luxury flowers as
well then you can get 30% off so I'll
leave a little code down below if you'd
like to do that so anyway on to my
empties I'm not going to use in any
particular order I'm just gonna have a
rummage through and let you know what I
thought of everything so the first thing
that's in there is the Schwarzkopf
essence old team shampoo and conditioner
it's their citrus and oil blonde and
brightening blonde on bright range and I
have been using this not every day but
I'd say maybe once or twice a week and I
find that it really if you have blonde
hair and I've recently had mine colored
then you can sometimes tell when you
need a new color it go a little bit dull
and this just really brightens my blonde
and makes it almost like a whiter blonde
and I really really love that especially
in the summer it looks almost sunkissed
previous blonde shampoos and
conditioners I've tried have made my
hair feel quite heavy whereas this I
feel like it just strips all the rubbish
out of my hair leaving it really fresh
and I think that in itself really
lightens blonde hair so if you're blonde
and maybe you want to leave
little bit longer between colors or you
just want to brighten up a few shades
and I definitely recommend this it's the
shampoo and conditioner that I reach for
on special occasions I think I might
have talked about this in a favorites
video before because I loved it so much
but yes so this is all the run out and I
would definitely repurchase this shampoo
and conditioner set I think it's really
cheap as well you can get it from Tesco
Sainsbury's it's nearly always on
special offer so definitely going to be
repurchasing these ones next another
product from my shower this is the
ginger and co ginger and spice creamy
body wash this is a really good one if
you maybe don't have time to use a
moisturizer to get out of the shower or
if you've just come back from a holiday
or you have slightly dry skin because
it's really really moisturizing and also
again really cheap there's so many more
expensive versions of things like this
but this I think retails for just a
couple of pounds this also goes into a
really thick lather and I know a lot of
these moisturizing shower gels don't
really lather up and bubble up so much
whereas this really does I used to use
it with my exfoliating gloves and so I
just rub the gloves together and use it
all over the body so usually when you
exfoliate your skin can be a little bit
dry afterwards but if I use this it kind
of counteracts the dryness of the
exfoliation so love this and definitely
again something a little bit more pricey
on the luxurious side of things is the
origins purifying charcoal body wash
this was such an absolute treat to use I
used to use this after I've been to the
gym because it really five pulls any
dirt that might be in your skin out so
if you get little sweat spots and it was
really gross but if you get another
sweat spots when you go to the gym then
this is a really good thing for that
because if you've tried the clear
improvements mask you'll know that it
really just drags all the dirt out of
your face and this basically does the
same for your body it is a I don't if
you can see a dark colored solution like
the charcoal mask but you don't leave it
on the body you just use it like a
normal shower gel and it's really been
lovely
my boyfriend also has been doing this
quite regularly so it's great for guys
as well and it's quite pricey but I
think it is worth it as far as charge
gels go it's really really fab
so this would be
we purchased last thing from the shower
this is my Clarence pure melt cleaning
gel only finished this recently I used
to use this not on an everyday basis but
really only when I was in the shower and
using my para sonic it's one that
doesn't hugely bubble up so if I just
wanted to give my skin a gentle cleanse
to the cry sonic fan I would use this
it's a gel but it turns into an almost
milky texture when you add water or use
it with a cleansing brush and it's just
more for those days when I'm having
quite a good skin day and I just want to
give my place a clean but without going
too deep and I don't want to risk maybe
bring out any spots or anything so this
is a lovely gentle cleanser you can
apply it to dry skin but I normally
apply it when I'm already in the shower
so my skin's normally already a little
bit wet why not apply it but really
really lovely I have got a lot of
cleansers on the guy at the moment so I
won't be repurchasing this but if I
didn't have those other cleansers then I
would because I'm really enjoyed using
this found one more thing from the
shower this is the evader damage remedy
intensive restructuring it treatment so
this I have been reaching for a lot
recently because having we've got back
from holiday the beach does do terrible
things to blonde hair really dry and
crispy on ends but this brings it back
to life really rescues my hair it is a
very very deep conditioning treatment I
think it says to leave on for five
minutes yeah it says it says to leave on
for two to five minutes but I tend to
leave on while I late my legs or
exfoliating my whole body so I tend to
leave this on for closer to 10 minutes
and I really notice the difference with
my hair after I use this so this is
definitely something that I'll be
repurchasing because I've become quite
reliance on this recently I have
suddenly run out of my Liz Earle
botanical essence number fifteen perfume
you might have seen on my Instagram or
Twitter a while ago that I dropped my
first bottle smashed everywhere but of
course there had to be rarities meant so
I got this and I have been using it
probably everyday and since it's not the
hugest bottle and it's not the strongest
of cents so I do apply quite a lot which
is probably why I've used it up
quite quickly but it is just being most
gorgeous smell I kind of want this to be
like my signature fragrance because it's
so so lovely it's quite grown up but
really sophisticated and it just its
took the bottle still smells and it's
just the most incredible fragrance so
this is definitely on my repurchase list
I think I mentioned these two little
guys and my first ever youtube video my
he give us my March or April favorites
and it says unique herbal recovery
advanced serum and an advanced eye serum
so I use these regularly everyday for
March April May and really really love
them my skin had never been better
I think it's also just losing the war
ground for serums really really helped
my skin likes consistency so I think it
loved just continually being treated to
these so these two you both have
anti-aging properties for the thing that
I'm most liked about them is that they
really protect the skin from any
pollution I live in the middle of London
and I travel into London every single
day for work so I'm really conscious of
not letting the pollution really get to
my skin but these have really just
helped keep my skin clean and fresh and
I've just absolutely been loving using
these on a daily basis I think I talked
quite a lot about these in at my April
favorites videos so I'll link that down
below if you wanted a more thorough
review but yeah I would definitely be
repurchasing these two although I might
try something else from the gellick
range I think I've got something from
their rose water range a similar product
to try it so might give those a go next
and I've got the blend glow super mud
mask this seem to it last absolutely
forever and ever I think I purchased
this maybe maybe a year ago it was quite
pricey I think it might even have been
like around the forty pound mark so I
won't be repurchasing this pretty
because of the price but I did say I
think in my blog post about it that it
was the first face mask that I tried
that I really noticed a difference
straight after using it it was really
quite amazing I had incredibly bad skin
that day and I'm using the mask I just
had lovely fresh glowing skin my
appear to be less angry my skin just
looked overall a little bit more
flawless but then I think I discovered
or rediscovered the origins care
improvements mask after using this and
just thought that it's so much better
value and it does a really really
similar job so I absolutely love this
know whether you're posting it just
because I could buy the origins and then
the last few things in my bag are things
which are used up on the holidays so I
just got back from 10 days in Corfu and
I got through quite a lot of PT products
while I was there
so the first thing is my peep 28 Sun
cream I actually went through about four
full-size bottles of the p20 while I was
out there this is just the last little
bottle actually has nothing left in it
but p20 is basically such a great song
cream because you apply it in the
morning and you can just forget about it
for the rest of the day it really really
is one day only waterproof sweat proof
and you can turn through it because it
is kind of an oily formula so absolutely
love p20 and will repurchase it for
practically every holiday that I go on
for the rest of my life so this is just
a small bottle because obviously I
didn't want to bring home four bottles
just for this video but I did go through
a lot of this on holiday I also finished
off my Clarins water comfort one-step
cleanser waters away it's actually a
teeny tiny bit left so I might take it
to suits in with me but it is such a
great size for traveling really really
tiny bottle and you don't need any water
with it so you can just use a cotton pad
to remove from a cup and it removes
waterproof makeup as well I was using
the parents ultra with mascara which is
seriously the most waterproof thing ever
but this is really great at getting that
off as well as any Sun cream or other
makeup you have on so I'll definitely be
repurchasing this and I'll be you're
purchasing it in this size as well
because it's great for traveling for the
first few days on the beach I still
wanted to have a little bit of coverage
on my face without having too much
makeup on
so I took my bare minerals complexion
rescue with me I know you guys are
probably a little bit bored of me
talking about this because I think it's
been in my last like four videos or
something but it is finally over I
finished it off and I was
holiday so I was using it as I said the
first few days and also in the evenings
because the shape that I've got is quite
a woman's age so it really suited my
skin on the holiday evenings and the
last few days I added a bit of bronzer
on top because it was a few shades paler
than rest of my body but this is SPF 30
so a great friend summer and it's just
such a lovely consistency gives you this
glowy
actually I'm not going to review it now
because I reviewed it so many times but
absolutely love this definitely
repurchase from this because it is the
best another bareMinerals product which
I actually finished this morning very
sadly is the bareMinerals matte
foundation this is SPF 15 so again
another good one for summer I tend to
use this when I'm having a slightly oily
skin day and I don't need too much
coverage if that's something sense so
having a good skin day but slightly oily
skin there because it gives a lovely
coverage but without really blocking up
your skin so your skin can still shine
through but be perfectly mattify so this
is a great one to use after holidays
because I find my skin and sometimes a
little bit shiny but good at the same
time so I've just got this on today
nothing else on my skin but from a tiny
bit of concealer and it's all gone
I will definitely be repurchasing this
because it's just become a savior to me
recently I've also been using it prior
to the holiday 2d shine any areas and
almost set my foundation down these two
actually go together really really well
if you have used this as a base but one
that's hardly a bit more coverage or D
shine on a few areas then I just would
swipe a little bit of this over the
areas that you want a bit more coverage
and yeah they go together really nicely
and will be repurchasing them both
I also took with me to Corfu this giant
bottle of the rituals after Sun
hydrating lotion this is really fat
because it's a lovely very light and
refreshing body lotion but because of
the idea it's also good for healing the
skin after a day in the Sun and I just
found that it lasted the whole time it
was me using at my boyfriend and my mom
and we only just got through it during
the ten days so that's like 30 days
worth of body lotion I think I applied
it after the shower and before bed so
that's yeah a lot of use and it was just
a really lovely print so I would be a
person that's before future holidays
this I don't know if it was slightly
gross that I kept this packet but I had
never tried any Palmers hair products
before but this is the Palmers coconut
oil deep conditioning protein pack and
I'm not sure where I got this from I
think it might have been in a goodie bag
or something I found it in one of my
drawers and just thought this is perfect
to take on holidays it's just a little
sachet I didn't mean you want to take
this huge thing with me because it was
half empty before I went anyway but this
was really great at saving my hair after
a day on the beach because my hair was
really really dried out and I just loved
this on left it for about 20 minutes
went and sat outside with my hair all
powered up and then rinsed it out and it
was the day I used it was the day after
I'd been on the donuts that go behind
the speedboat so my hair was so naughty
it was like I couldn't even put my
fingers through it was so naughty but
after having this on for 20 minutes my
hair was lovely and sleek and smooth see
if you have problems with your hair on
holiday then definitely grab some fees
I'm not sure we can get them probably
boots I will try and find out and link
below but definitely you will be
practicing these future holidays also as
a way I took this chordally feeling
perfect cell renewal night cream I'd
already started using this at home and I
knew that I liked it but I finished it
off was on holiday it's a cell renewal
night cream and for me I just thought my
cells will probably need renewing after
a day in the Sun so this was really
really super or just slaughtering all
over my face before I went to bed and if
my skin was feeling a little bit dry
then this really just replenished any
damage that my skin had endured during
the day and just made me wake up with
lovely nothing
I just thought my skin might have got a
little bit damaged during the day or was
a little bit angry and this just really
calmed my skin down and made me wake up
with a lovely glowing I'm just not oily
at all but just a very fresh complexion
so I think I'll try and find some more
little sample sizes of this because it's
really great for putting in your beach
bag if you're going on a short holiday
only 10 mil but seemed to last me or
lost me this holiday and I'd say maybe
two weeks before so it's a great size if
you're traveling and if you just need
something tiny but really powerful for
using in the evenings couple things
which are not holiday related but I also
run out of last two things firstly the
origins super spot remover this is
actually the first blogger freebie that
I ever got so I went to an origins event
my first ever vlog event and was given
one of these and it has been an absolute
savior ever since so this little pot is
over a year and a half old I don't if
that's really unhygenic and gross but it
still worked right down to the very last
drop this is probably the best spot
treatment I have ever tried I recommend
it to everybody and I've heard about its
greatness before I tried it and it lived
up to every single expectations
it gets got salicylic acid in it I'm not
sure it doesn't sound a bottle but it
just really dries out spots I put it on
the evening it can go a little bit
crispy but you know it's bad and the
next day just the redness the anger it's
just completely taken out and then the
following day fees again your spot will
most probably be gone this it's just the
greatest stuff I think it's about 17
pounds a bottle but I'm not even sure
which is I know quite excruciating for
something this tiny but honestly if you
get the odd pimple and you want them
gone which I'm sure you do then it's a
hundred percent worth that money because
as I said it's lasted so long I've
probably used this about four or five
times a week any spot that I get this
goes straight on it and it's just a
nasty
Savior so we'll have you approaching
this absolutely yes I have no qualms
about spending whatever it is on me
buying this because it's a savior and
last but not least my Rimmel lasting
finish 25 hour nude foundation SPF 20
actually finished this a little while
ago before it got really hot and summery
but I couldn't bring myself to throw it
away because it was so amazing it's not
even that I saved it for this video
excited wasn't planning on doing this
video I just didn't want to throw it
away because I almost wanted to remind
myself to rebuy it once summer was over
because it gives the loveliest loveliest
finish my friends think that I have got
some kind of crazy expensive foundation
on or that I've been averaging my
pictures when I wear this because it
looks so incredible when it's on I think
I might have talked about this in my
April favorites or if not it's written
about all over my blog so I'll leave
some review posts down below but I was
really sad when I finished this when I
came to the very last pump you can't
really tell that it's finished although
if I pump it absolutely nothing will
come out savoring news I will definitely
be repurchasing this when it comes to
autumn / winter I think it's probably a
bit too heavy for summer because it
gives a really good coverage but when it
comes to autumn winter then I 100% be
reviving this it's really cheap as well
I think definitely less than 10 pounds
in boots or superdrug and I definitely
prefer it to a lot of my higher-end
foundations so I'm upsetting this is
gone now but we'll definitely be buying
it again and that's it my little rubbish
bag of empties is also not empty I hope
you've enjoyed looking through all these
products I really think that looking at
these products they are all things I
have really really loved and enjoyed
using and a lot of these will be
repurchased and highly recommend them to
you fact that I've used them up is a
real testament to help
they also hope you found this video
interesting let me know if you'd like to
see more empties videos I will try and
keep this little bag or another bag in
my wardrobe or next to my bins so that I
can just keep putting in any products
that I use up if you enjoyed this video
