scream hey guys welcome back today I
have an incredibly exciting video
because I have two or three very special
guests with me I have the fabulous Dec
rose and her gorgeous little refit
with the bear and if you guys watched my
vlog last week you will have already met
my little Dexter he was curly absolutely
loving this little lone crocodile so
Becca and I today have been two pets at
home we've been buying lots and lots of
puppy pieces and Beth has been give me
lots of advice on the kind of things to
buy as professional pug mom she's been
giving me a lot of tips I'm just gonna
let Dexter down actually because he is
oh look at the road oh my gosh it is so
hard filling with a puppy you think it's
hard filming two people but like these
guys are just stealing the show so over
on Becker's channel today you will find
a video all about puppies puppies 101
and just tips and tricks on a very
amateur tips and tricks I'm just email
yeah it's really good though because we
can relate yeah exactly exactly so I'll
finish watching this make sure you go
and watch Becca's video and you'll find
out loads of tips about puppies but
right now here we're going to go through
all of the things which we picked up at
pets at home and a few of the bits which
I bought before we picked up Dexter so
let's get started so as soon as Charlie
and I decided we were going to get a
dachshund we basically didn't really
know anything about dachshund
so we picked up Jackson's poor dummies
and these books basically got through
got me through my GCSEs and a-levels
that's pretty bad isn't it haha and the
book basically just gave us lots of just
these small tips things that we know
what a thought about so this was really
useful I'm sure they do it for those
other breeds yeah they have pugs that I
don't know I did you I didn't look I
suggested Jose to get this this is the
puppy and kitten toothpaste and finger
brush can I just say it's meat flavor me
so you're going to find it repulsive but
those Dexter's gonna love it
so basically as soon as possible you
need to start fiddling with the mouse
because it makes
they get used to it and they won't nor
never on your fingers and so with this
it's a little finger brush
yeah it's meat flavored but they love it
and even if he just licks it to start
with that's fine because it refreshing
breath and they'll just say your dog has
chicken chicken breath I hear you're
Donnie this morning either one and
fights to ever reason and tonight then I
was quite simply witness and it's like a
good jump into fresh ng fresh fights
flat crushes breath and non enzyme
formula with added calcium from pizza
home we also got this mini grooming set
Dexter is absolutely tiny so mini is
completely okay with me I guess this
would pretty much be the same size for
reaper's what love yeah
Rupert only uses this kind of brush with
long haired dog so this one is good
because it gets to the actual root and
to the under her skin I have no ideas
for a joke either come back then she
doesn't even say make it's all tabs on
each lid on the mini groomers that
contains a soft pin slicker bristle
brush set bristle brush and then Thomas
okay's help you but now wait another my
son milk drop I thought they were you
and you paper but I know so excited no I
I got I get Reaper these and love them
so the potty milk drops and they're
really good for it when the toilet
training going idea oh my gosh but I
break my I've used to break mine in half
they weren't even that big but it's just
nice to bring them home before we got
Dexter obviously I wanted to kick him
out with a lovely wardrobe where days
arms go I don't know
but through that bit so we picked up
this GA from I think this was actually
from John Lewis it's much much as a
brand oh sure we got it from John Lewis
and how cute is that
it's much too big for him at the moment
so we have to wait for him to get a
little bit older because it's definitely
gonna be dangling off him this is my 37
pounds though yeah if if you have a dog
that would like a harness
go on Etsy as a shopkin pick juicer that
won't show you they say because I have
bow ties attached to my berry passion of
mine I need to get next to
the outfits how many outfits does roofer
uploads I need I need expert in the
summer officer he gets it all yeah but
it's kind of context it was cold today
yeah commute anymore office so the rest
of this box is basically filled with
treats I don't know if you can see
sweets and toys toys and training
because everybody loves cheat some toys
the most exciting on the 112 is this
giant jammie Dodger or it's called a
jammie slobber channel is so cute I was
just about safe don't click it okay oh
my god so gangster eyed he hasn't been
introduced to this one yet we're kind of
trying to test the water well it is -
toy gun so we have energy introduces one
to Dexter yet because we're trying to
gradually introduce toys and so doing
them all at once so it hasn't played
around with this one yet but I think you
will like it because it's got a kind of
like squidgy materials and it could be
good for his I'm teething so this is my
favorite so far Dexter's favorite is
this now beheaded alligator so back
exactly not when you set that was like
this is not this hardly doesn't it it's
just out of it yeah look he's so cute
his teeth are so tiny he got that
doesn't have a power to behead no but
this was from pets at home and they had
loads of things like like the pasta
flavors know and have like the green and
red and white pasta robot likes the
green want is he in one now another one
on that he's going crazy
so I got Dexter a couple of these little
yummy crocodiles
Rupert's is a bit bigger hold on baby
toothbrush here we go this is called a
Nylabone what's that oh I've got loads
of these it looks pretty boring well it
just got lipstick no it doesn't about
but it's good for TV again because they
can just sit into it sigh okay I can
give out a shrine yeah
and Dexter we're ready to start ignoring
away all of my slippers so we got him a
mini shoe so that he can it's wrong that
they love him these have been around for
like all of the years yeah and that's a
good Roy g-spot I will say be careful
with the ladies cuz obviously that can
okay I doesn't it break off it does we
got this one from Amazon this is I have
no idea oh it's a brand called calm
might have either idea
well it looks really strange but I've
read on loads of places that Kong is
like our um puppy toys and you basically
shove treats in the holes at the end of
this and it's like does it go out there
ugly squirty so it's not like bits you
can put like paste in it Oh main meeting
pad I don't know I've just been like
forcing the iron woman because he can
smell his treats but he's teething he's
like ignoring the way it is to try and
get the treats out we ordered it in blue
by the way I'm not really mean I'm
trying to turn my dog into a girly
loving dog but yeah we wanted a blue one
that's ready boy crinkle cow it squeaks
here I'm a sorcerer
it's like your old friend used to have
one of those things in there so I guess
that they really like the whole texture
and movement and this but we haven't
introduced as much text yet so hopefully
he'll might bring our logs in love Jonas
it's so sad he's gonna love it
also from pets at home what else tree
hunting colorful a vibe
did we get one for Rupert one for Dad
okay so you have tea bags and shuffle
coin um yeah we have colorful blue bags
because he likes black or green bags
nobody and yeah they have pink ones and
everyone's which is my stuffing now I
mix poohbear sauce less gross less PE
yeah that's food and you told me to get
this where this is yeah it's like patio
driving spray so it's like in between
baths I borrow a book quite a lot
because I obviously use Johnson's baby
shampoo that's not paint
it's nice little yeah
and I just like mosquito spray okay but
they probably will like run away it was
like what are you doing just like who's
Amy this is to make them not smell my
door guys it says odor busting
antibacterial action and fresh fragrance
exactly why not this is a really weird
contraption and then after daily I don't
know I think they have to like pull the
rope but if we can't get them out
edit out all the streets in this city i
busy buddy
I suppose if they're on their own this
will keep them occupied yeah maybe I
should get that - Dexter at night
basically Dexter has been crying all
night bless him Becker that's Ruppert
sleep in her bed but Charlie and I are
trying to like get Rupert sir not reboot
they're trying to get those two to sleep
downstairs but he cries all the time so
we're trying to find something that will
keep them entertained and I guess they
have to like oh okay I did it it's like
forgotten all right yeah so we got this
for Dexter and his little chewy bits and
Dexter absolutely loves rope so this
that he's been really enjoying so this
is them this was a good one and last
thing if my pets at home bag is a puppy
- you were going recommended this one I
am there's a little else sounds like
exes break
that's what Dexter smells like yeah he
smells like so this is a neither bone
puppy chew softer for teething puppy so
it's very so I was a screeching Oh Mike
it's Mike
oh no I've been miss they're not
supposed to swallow it it's just God
Anna
yeah it's chicken flavored you can also
get Megan flavored and milk flavored
milk yeah oh yeah it's like mummy Tommy
milk also we got some puppy food we
previously had Dexter on the Irish puppy
food but he just wasn't really loving it
he wasn't like wolfing it down and Becca
said that Rupert was loving the James
well beloved naturally healthy Chucky
and rise puppy food so I grabbed some of
this from pets at home as well Oh Dexter
eight why library put straight away with
need your manager but Rupert is on the
same brand but adults small breed so
that's what don't someone move on to
when he's like five six seven yeah it
depends on his way as well okay and you
think that this when you have to add me
to - right well also my freaking good
okay yeah so we're going to try texture
on this food and hopefully he'll like it
because I mean to fan up that little boy
the last thing that we got at pets at
home was this really really gorgeously
soft like I could sleep on this quite
happily fed show you completely and this
one has got a really lovely warm section
obviously it's not room right now but
it's got what did you call it as a group
or we like wheat so you unzip it up back
and take it out put it like right and
your dog's got endless so much a good
idea so if you like Dex you can get
quite cold and legs up this you need to
make sure you keep that bow show
no no that's nothing because if they go
straight on to that power yeah from
little Tommy's I'm too hot hot damn we
actually already had a bed for Dexter
that we got from Amazon but I'll
probably switch them around and put this
one in his little cage area and put that
one like in a bedroom or something I'm
just want a sofa or just spare that
because but I have two dog beds and
lastly these are two that we got before
we got Dexter and these are by far his
favorite toys so this is his string
again lately home I think I know I feel
like Amazon and trying to say something
like he's not who you think he is but um
yeah he absolutely has been loving
chasing this around we've got water and
flaws so this makes like a really
satisfying noise and we know if he hears
it being kicked or something he'll come
and pounce on it so he loves this and he
really loves having this tickle on his
nose and her style she's around and
Rupert seems to quite like me and lastly
toy wise this is the one that we took
with us when we picked text up from his
mummy slash breeder and while we were
there we left this with the mom and
Dexter's brothers and sisters so they
could really get their scent because one
of my friends recommended you take
something so that it just gives them
like the fragrance of their mom and
their brother and sister to just help
them settle in Dexter has been really
loving this one thank you choose it all
the time if he's chewing my finger then
I'll just pass him their son teal chew
this instead which is great because it's
too can be sharp yeah so already got
dreadlocks is my god
cutie so this is a Dexter's favorite at
the moment so definitely get your dog
fishing one if you know dog and last but
not least we also picked up a puppy
blanket this is something which I have
been putting on the floors like I said
you've got wooden floor and it's just
not the most comfortable for either me
or don't use it like on a blanket yeah I
think Dexter kind of knows now when I
put this on the floor then it means it's
playtime because we both kind of snuggle
and lay on it and its really soft so
it's great for just cussing cussing
nothing's great for just laying and
cuddling your puppy it's quite big as
well so it's plenty sufficient area
space for you to do your play tiring
just look how like bigger than a doormat
it's really really big so this has
become kind of our cuddle and play mat
and it's a brand called scrubs I think
it actually is a longer name than that
pets love scrubs
yeah so Dexter absolutely loves this
really glad I bought this and it's
pretty much like his favorite kind of
snuggly material so that is everything
that we picked up today at pets at home
and a few of the bits that I got before
we picked Dexter up hopefully this has
been useful for you if you're getting a
puppy anytime soon or if you just wanted
to get some new toys for your little
puppy as I said we filmed a puppy 101 on
Becky's channel so make sure you go and
watch that now I will link it down below
so make sure you go check that out thank
you guys so much for watching please
