joining me for today's video this is
really exciting because I'm doing a
revolve haul today and I have never done
a revolve hole before and yet so many of
you guys are us-based
and I know that it's obviously such a
great retailer in the US and now they
ship to the UK I thought what a fabulous
opportunity to do a little bit of
shopping there and show you the pieces
that I have picked up so Revolver
actually in the UK at the moment the
team are here there's gonna be loads of
events this week so I have stocked up on
loads of really lovely outfits to wear
throughout the different events
hopefully I'll be able to show you some
clips on the screen of me wearing these
pieces as well so that you can see how
they look on as with all of my hauls
everything that I mentioned in this
video everything you can see including
what I'm wearing now my rail my mirror
everything will be linked in the
description box so just click show more
for all the links and if you are new to
my channel then hello and welcome and I
hope that you will stick around for
loads more fashion videos I do tons of
styling videos lots of travel loads of
really fun things look books loads of
hauls etc so please do hit the subscribe
button and that way you won't miss any
of my future videos so without further
ado let me show you what I got from
revolve okie dokie so this first piece
is from a brand that I not heard of
before it's called n B de I'm guessing
that means no big deal I'm not sure but
it says gorgeous and I totally fell in
love with the color of this one
beautiful play suit or is it a skirt
dress no it's actually a dress it's a
proper dress not a play suit it's just
the most fabulous fun colors super
bright this with a tan is going to look
amazing I am a little bit bronzed at the
moment because I had a tan luxe spray
tan which was just fabulous I feel like
it's such a natural color and this just
incredibly enhances your tan so the
lovely low-cut and then at the eyelash
detail of the lace here just looks so so
gorgeous against the skin with a
delicate gold necklace it's similar to
the one that I'm wearing now this is
just going to look so so dreamy so very
excited to wear this the same eyelash
lace and scalloped detail is along the
bottom so just making it really fun and
feminine and very very me lovers and
friends is a friend that I heard a lot
about during the Reward style conference
whenever I went up to someone to ask
where their dress or their jumpsuit was
from it was always lovers and friends so
I've been dying to try some of this
brown
out for myself I picked up this pair of
jeans they are a size 25 around the
waist
I wear UK six I do have fairly wide hips
of my size but these fit really really
well and what I love about them is
they're not super super skinny so it's a
little bit more modern and they have a
very ripped jagged hem which I think
it's a really nice style these with
mules or sandals just look absolutely
dreamy
I love high-waisted trousers as well it
means I can wear crop tops this top that
I'm wearing now would look really really
nice with these everything that is a
small complaint is that when I was
putting them on my foot kept getting
stuck in the RIP detail because I am
very mal coordinated this is another
piece from lovers and friends I don't
know which way around to show you it's
very airy okay so this looks really
we're just holding it up but it is a
beautiful top lovely soft fabric I think
I have a dress in this material as well
very very similar that I wore in the
Maldives it's got long sleeves really
lovely light material so great for
spring it's quite open so I might have
to get some sticky tape to just attach
it to my bras EA or actually maybe I
should find one of those lace bando tops
I don't have one of those if you have
any recommendations where to get them
please let me know because when I tried
it on it was a little bit gaping but it
has beautiful little metallic flecks you
can see their little metallic flecks in
the material which just catches the
light so delicately and again I got this
in an extra small and looks fabulous
with the tan and maybe a long hanging
kind of lariat style necklace this is
from a brand that I am a little more
familiar with Tularosa I thought this
will just make the most fabulous beachy
place suit so you've got these little
straps here it is actually again a skirt
not a short style place suit and then it
has a little cuff detail on the sleeves
the colors are just so cute and feminine
very candy-striped style and it fits
really beautifully around the bodice
then you've got this lovely little
elasticated detail here and a little bow
again a great one with Tam really fun
they're really easy to wear a great
summer holiday piece these little
ruffles around the skirt as well I think
are so so cute and girly very very me I
feel like lovers and friends is a great
band for me I have quite a lot of bits
from them this is a dress and it's a
little bit more I would say evening he
my other piece is it's got a lovely
sloping shoulder detail so this goes up
over the shoulder this one hangs down
and then you also have the little Bardot
style half sleeve going on this side as
well the material is a mix of different
colored Pink's in this lovely lace
pattern and then you've got this layer
of frill going down the bottom which is
just so so beautiful again it fits the
body really beautifully and it just
looks absolutely stunning I feel like my
holiday wardrobe is so sorted thanks to
revolve something else from Tularosa
that again would be great for holidays
and it's not pink or white I really
pushed the vote out here it is this
beautiful little dress lovely
lightweight material feels like silk but
I don't think he was expensive enough to
be a full silk dress once again quite a
low neckline so I'm really gonna have to
have a little look in my lingerie drawer
to make sure they've got some
appropriate pieces then this band around
the waist makes it really flattering
really goes in at the right places and
then the skirt when I love all these
pieces they love the feminine design
details like the ruffles so this is
really beautiful very tropical style
print so great again if you've got any
vacations coming up soon this will
definitely pack up really small into a
suitcase as well again from lovers and
Friends something a little smarter I
picked up this pair of trousers I really
like trousers on slightly chillier
spring days if I want to look a little
bit smarter four days of meetings these
are super super high waisted so
incredibly flattering and I love this
material it feels like linen but the
fact that it's not hugely horrendously
creased makes me think it's not actually
linen more like a cotton twill style
material despite me being quite short
these actually fit me lengthwise really
well I got the size extra small and they
do have little darts little pleated
detail so perfectly fitting around the
hips and the waist area if I want to
make the trousers appear a little bit
more casual this could be a really nice
top to do so this I think is Tularosa
yes Tularosa very thin spaghetti straps
making it great for those hot days with
denim shorts maybe and over a bikini
perhaps because other than the spaghetti
straps which you could definitely just
tuck in and not wear it's just basically
a super stretchy Bardot top really easy
to pull on and off great for tanning
great for high-waisted denim shorts and
just beautiful tiered lace detail very
very cute this dress from
LPA was actually the first thing I tried
on and I was so surprised because it's
very very simple it's just this lovely
frill detail at the top and then
straight down no other design detail a
slit going from about half way at the
thigh down to the bottom it's so simple
that's so elegant this would be an
amazing wedding guest outfit if you've
got a wedding coming up or if you have
got any lovely events polo engagement
parties such a lovely just having your
wardrobe really lightweight as well
beautiful color and I really like the
low back if you've got a tanned back
then this will look absolutely dreamy
plus it has got adjustable straps so if
you want to make it a little bit higher
a little bit lower depending on how much
cleavage or chest you want to show then
it is adjustable yes very very simple
very elegant and very me and then the
last couple of pieces I picked up this
pair of jeans these are girlfriend denim
and girlfriend denim is something that
I've heard a lot about that's have been
yet to try these fits really really
nicely very high waisted I really like
this wash it's quite western style
you've got a little bit of distressed
affect on the pockets and then very
distressed down at the bottom I was
distressed after trying to get my foot
in here but I really like this effect
once it's on I think these with perhaps
my Gucci mules could look really really
cool and I don't have any jeans with
this wash so very excited to wear these
and once again these are called the
Karolina I got the 25 inch waist last
but not least this adorable little pair
of shorts because I find shorts like
this so handy in summer usually on hot
days in the UK when I just want to wear
a bandeau style bikini top and then a
little pair of shorts to lie around in
the garden on holidays some of the kind
of thing they don't take up much space
in your suitcase but you wear them so so
much they are Michael Costello revolve
collaboration again I got the size extra
small very simple white shorts with just
this beautiful lace panel down at the
side it's very effective looks really
cute again with the eyelash detail down
at the bottom which I think looks so
lovely against tanned toned skin that's
so no doubt I'll be getting a lot of use
out of these at this summer so that's
everything that I picked up from revolve
