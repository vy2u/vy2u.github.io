for joining me for today's video it's
going to be the first video of the
fashion mumbler some art all week so
just like I did in spring I'm going to
be sharing with you a whole video
hopefully if all goes to plan every
single day this week kicking off today
with River island so the reason why I'm
doing this whole week now is because
we're really starting to get into the
summer weather
touchwood so it's making me want to
bring in a few new pieces into my
wardrobe so the rest of this week I'm
going to share with you a few hauls
ranging from budget halls including like
misguided Miss Selfridge maybe even some
Primark bits and bobs there's going to
be a premium haul and also the usual
Topshop a South River Island so I hope
you guys enjoyed the upcoming videos if
you don't want to miss any please make
sure you hit the subscribe button which
is just down here and also click that
little bell because I know that YouTube
is doing something totally crazy and not
letting you guys know when my video is
going live all the time
if you hit a little belt then you'll
definitely get the notification so going
to get started with what I have fought
recently from River Island so personally
I think that River Island has so many
fabulous pieces in at the moment they
definitely look a lot more high-end they
are and the pieces I have already been
wearing I've worn a lot so definitely
really good cost per wear before I
forget about it this top here is from
River Island I picked this up only about
a week ago I just love it I think I'm
going to be getting so much use out of
this and summer I really like the
unusual neckline I just love this kind
of broad ryeong Bay style lace it's got
a little bit of embroidery all over it
and then of course you've got the frill
trend which isn't going anywhere on this
beautiful neckline so the big big fan of
this top I'm going to take me with me on
my upcoming travels so apologies in
advance for the Instagram spam of me
wearing this so this is the first piece
that I didn't want to forget so yeah
love this top going to be wearing it in
loads over for another
item or items like I started wearing are
these sandals so I took these to my
recent trip to Madrid I'll leave my
Madrid outfit Diaries
down below in case you want to see me
wearing these in action but they were
quite unusual for me because they're a
little bit kind of punky almost because
they're black and they've got studs on
them but I just thought they look like a
really good heel height so I can walk
around and I did walk around all day in
a steel pipe really nice big wide straps
they're very good quality I think
they're aligned like luxury edition or
they're more premium like what they call
you intuition which is available online
so yeah very good quality very
comfortable because these are slightly
padded but you can get any wrist ring
even though I wore them all around
Madrid and also to fly in the very first
aired warning so incredibly comfy they
have these straps which you can tie
around your ankles and yeah I just think
they're a really lovely addition to the
outfit a warden weird which was a pair
of clots so big some of these already
very different for me but very glad I
picked them up and I feel like sandals
is kind of an essential in a summer
wardrobe and I also wore this to travel
to Madrid
it is another River Island for a jacket
if you saw my video about High Street
goop then you may see that I also have a
light pink version of this which I'm
really sorry I know it sold out pretty
quickly but this is the darker more
dusky pink I was a light pink one so
much I always get compliments when I
wear it I look how soft it is I love the
quality and I love the price as well I
believe they're 58 pounds so I decided
to get the dark pink version as well
confident but I get a lot of use out of
it and already I have you want it rather
a lot so beautiful beautiful color very
wearable it's kind of an earthy pinky
tone but you're definitely still getting
pink in your water which as you all know
is the color of the season so hopefully
this one won't sell out quite that
quickly I will leave a link down below
so if you wanted to treat yourself
I wouldn't recommend hanging around
because they're so fabulous that that's
probably going to sell out again oh my
goodness my Instagram mine's a little
bit crazy when I wore this recently I
love this to our rooftops dinner in the
trees and it's just so stunning so it's
River Island which I know a lot of
people were very surprised by when I
said
it was in my Instagram stories I just
love the stress river islands are now
doing a they have a section on the
website all around their premium
occasion layer which is so up my street
I just I love occasion where I love
things are a little bit more glamorous
than you know your everyday dresses just
summer occasions why not dress up a
garden parties for barbecues if you've
got any nice dinners it was going away
anywhere and yet you don't want to spend
an absolute bomb on these kind of things
because they are statement so you know
you may not wear them millions and
millions of times so river island price
points for me for premium occasion where
are spot on that really glad I picked
this one up it's got this a very light
lace frill around the neckline for these
beautiful straps with the white
embroidery that was ladder detail which
was seeing himself portrayed was seeing
a Zimmerman definitely on trend the only
criticism I have is that the fine lace
the quality isn't that high it looks a
little bit cheap but from afar you
really can't tell I mean it doesn't look
bad at all it just you can tell it's not
one of these like three four five six
hundred pound directors from the quality
of place but with this price point I'm
definitely not complaining the impact is
actually stunning it's got a ditch
hemline so it's higher at the front than
it into the back so you can still see
your legs your tan your shoes it really
frames your shoes and then it's just so
elegant to the back you know what if I
was going to have a high street wedding
on a budget then I would totally get
married in this dress it is that
beautiful I wore it with my Astrid MMU
necklace which is a circle and then it
has this little pendant hanging down
from it I'll try and show a close-up and
I just thought it looked so gorgeous
together so yes big big fan of it and
you'll be seeing me wearing this a lot
more over some another simply stunning
dress from River Island is this one I
wore this once again in Madrid at the
Paseo there travel which is a beautiful
museum in the center of Madrid this is
just so stunning it's ninety pounds so
once again fairly affordable I just
think this is so gorgeous if you've got
any summer occasions coming up I've got
a friend's engagement party in a few
weeks so I think in a way this for that
it is it's the length and is
long so it's like me you're a bit of a
shorty and you definitely want to go for
some high heels I think I wore my
warmest your Weitzman with a pulp
I think they're about a seven inch heel
so it just about didn't touch the floor
I love the shape of this it's really
beachy fitted on the bodice got the
gorgeous ruffle detail and sleeves
you've got the zipper the back a little
tiny delicate drawstring and not
drawstring
kind of like a ribbon detail belt that
goes around the sensors put in the waist
and then the rest are just kind of
waterfalls down to the bottom it's just
so effective when it's on the way that
it moves is absolutely stunning I think
this is such a great Buy over 90 pounds
it's a really statement piece to have in
your wardrobe but just so lovely for
summer occasions so next we have a
spectacular two-piece these pieces are
actually available separately that I
bought them both just to try as you can
tell by all the labeled hanging I have
not worn these yet but not tried them on
yet either so I'm really looking forward
to trying these on it is this gorgeous
just very simple up and down dress no
real shape to it it's going to be a
really elegant just simple style but
covered in just beautiful it's some
ladies mother-of-pearl little beads so
just beautiful I guess it's like
hand-stitched on it at least I'm very
happy I can tell you that so would be
something to consider if you're thinking
of picking on the holiday it might be
your entire luggage allowance but if
you've got any events coming up in the
UK aside from webbing with the cursus is
fairly Bridal then this is just
absolutely spectacular but if I remove
this beautiful little jacket which i
think is such a lovely addition my
jacket is 75 pounds and again part of
the river island premium occasion where
policies and then the dress itself is
175 pounds so it's fairly pricey but
then when you have this much detail on
something all of this embroidery I'm not
surprised
in fact I think it's pretty good values
for all the detail you're getting here
so I'm trying to write my brains as to
what occasions I've got coming up and I
could wear this too so it's such a
stunning piece and yeah absolutely love
it rather than rewrite them before I
forget I also picked up two pairs of
some
houses these are both wrote gold frames
with rose tinted glasses these ones are
very key Australia vibes they've got
this bar going across the front
Catholics which is my favorite shape for
sunglasses just absolutely love them and
then these are very similar to the Dior
aviator style glasses you got the bar
going across the top little tour toys
shelves what'd you call it arms and I
will be the light in Spain a chair both
of these a lot while I was in Madrid so
take both those up and love both of
those I got this pair of shorts haven't
worn these yet they are the high-rise
hot pants 35 pounds they've got these
little pom-poms along the bottom which
this gives them a little point of
difference and to be honest I just
thought I've got a few more trips coming
up including one to Ibiza thought these
would be a really versatile piece to put
in my wardrobe so yeah kind of a summer
staple with a black hot pants and
finally I picked up these very bright
tailored floral shorts also River Island
I've not worn these yet we'll try them
on they were 30 pounds they once again
very affordable I think if you can get
away with it and these are very nice
smart things as your work wardrobe with
maybe a white silk browse the wax up
t-shirt but also just for if you want to
be a little bit smarter in the daytime
in Santurce shopping trips or lunch with
the girls things like that and then
really be to be tailored they've got the
dart they've got these little hidden
pockets and they do go narrow narrower
at the waist and then flare a little bit
they're very flattering style
I like to wear statement things on my
bottoms in the summertime so I thought I
pick those up and I can imagine getting
quite a lot of wear of these as well so
hopefully very good price per wear at
first pattern so that's everything I
picked up in my first River Island haul
of the summer season I'm sure it won't
be the last
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video as I mentioned at the beginning
everything that I've spoken about will
be linked down below so definitely open

week so if you made it to the end of the
video then make sure to leave an orange
