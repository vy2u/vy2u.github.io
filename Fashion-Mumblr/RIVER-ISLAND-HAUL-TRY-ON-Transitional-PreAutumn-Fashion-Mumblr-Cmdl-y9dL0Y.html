joining me for another haul as part of
fashion on the whole week
today it's going to be a river island
haul and we're starting to look at those
more autumnal pieces that are starting
to come in to the high street
Rivlin are quite an early adopter we're
starting to see a few of the autumn
winter 2017 trends in there at the
moment but also I have got a few summer
pieces too because I'm going on holiday
in a few days time so this is bit of a
mishmash fall and it could be quite a
long one because I've actually made two
orders in the past week so government is
have a cup of tea and get ready for a
long old haul so one pieces I want to
show you first that I have actually
already bought when I had a rummage
through my delivery bag to get this one
out that's what's so beautiful is this
ruffled toughest leaf white blouse and I
know it's not usual to buy white blouses
as we move into autumn but this one I
thought was beautiful so if you saw my
autumn winter trend video that I
published on Sunday you'll know that I
mentioned that balloon sleeves so
sleeves that really kind of puff up a
real trend or for this coming season
well this features that balloon clip
transfer in a really subtle and wearable
way it also has cuted material which
I've always been a huge fan of and that
is a trend we're seeing coming down from
spring summer into autumn winter I wear
white a lot but as you guys know and I
just thought this was a great holiday
and transition piece and then you've got
the same t2 detail going down to the
bottom here I can't remember if you will
have seen it already but one of the
hauls this week I am actually wearing
this top to film it so keep a lookout
for that bull the holes from whole week
will be linked down below if you want to
catch up on any we've got Zara Primark
Vicky River Island pop shop premium home
with nest porter and so many so
definitely make sure you're subscribed
so you don't miss any of my holes but
that is the first piece from River
Island which I absolutely adore this
next piece obviously I have not even
taken another packaging yet did you see
that much
oh my god thundering already I must have
been lightning and it wasn't very long
until the Sun became good tiring for me
to show you a cake because it has just
started thundering and lightning outside
I hope the lighting interval in this
video and that this is the cape and has
got pom-poms on it which is what
absolutely caught my attention and then
just throw this on now hopefully
avoiding the flowers so I absolutely
love capes just they are so cozy and so
fun for autumn I thought it was a really
difficult I guess that's only meant to
do it with local time the middle and
then as you can see let me tilt the
camera down and you can see it's got
this pom-pom detail down at the bottom
it doesn't feel particularly in places
that make sense I feel like the entry is
quite wide so it could like drop off at
any point but I guess it's really nice
for showing off your outfit underneath
so really like this one love the color I
love the pom-poms
they look like the kind of thing that
you buy like a crafter like handmade
kind of scarf but yeah really pretty I
think I might have also picked this up
it in gray as well so I definitely need
to decide and you guys can help me
decide which one's keep the next thing
in that bag is this handbag again from
Rhode Island I saw this and instantly
fell in love and added to our baskets I
think it looks so similar to the
Valentino bag that we're seeing in the
designer stores at the moment I adore
this color I think it is so perfect for
autumn into this beautiful wine burgundy
shade with the gold studs
I think it's absolute gorgeous this also
was only 26 pounds which i think is
amazing so one thing that I do slightly
dislike is this river island branding on
it here but you really can't read it
it's not very obvious at all so for that
price I don't mind at all
I also wish it that the strap could come
loose I wish that there was like a
little clip here but they are attached
so and you kind of have to work full
body or hold this long strap so you
can't just have it like this which is a
bit of a shame but again 26 pounds I'm
still really very beautiful as I
mentioned I'm going away in a couple of
days away from this horrendous weather
and I picked up a new pair of sunglasses
so River I need some glasses I just love
them I think they're always really on
trend really affordable and really good
quality as well I picked up the years
which have been ductility crazy because
they've got my hair in a bun have really
big bug eyes sunglasses but I love cat
eye sunglasses they just I feel like
they're the best shape for my face and
really really like those you've got a
gradient lens on them and they've got
some gold around the frame as well just
a really nice design details so I was
packing it clothes for my trip and then
also to make sure if I picked up a
beautiful day dress this is an online
exclusive so I'll leave links to this
and everything else in the hall down
below in case you want to show up any of
them but this is just a really beautiful
day dress I thought it looked quite
similar to one that I've seen in Ted
Baker so we've got this beautiful lace
detailing which goes all the way around
the arms I really like this effect
around the armholes it's like a little
kind of get Great Gatsby style think
that's really really beautiful and it
will lay up to the neckline as well this
is very Victoriana
style and then you've got this keyhole
detail at the back here so a really
really beautiful dress lengthwise very
elegant kind of just below the knee so
really lovely lady like a length and
definitely one I'll be wearing in the
evenings on my trip so very very happy
with that piece price-wise this was 45
pounds and I think it looks a lot more
prices than that so a really nice
investment piece here we've got Cape
number two and this one almost looks
reversible like it's got a pinky blush
color on the inside although living it
is reversible and put a tag stuck in
that price-wise these are 46 as well
same price as the dress then we fling at
this one arm I'm sorry if you can hear
the rain by the way it's absolutely
torrential how we bring this hard in
like forever
it's like a tropical storm Arthur so
here I am bundling up in my cape I
really like this one actually I like
those got the different color on the
inside
quite nice a bit more relaxed having the
bubbles just dangling down and then it'd
be bubbles on the bottom of this one are
a little bit more colorful you've got
blacks white or that Navy and then
people as well which I think that's
really really nice becomes slightly more
inclined to keep this one but again you
guys let me know your opinion because
very important to me to know what you
like yes let me know in the comments
below if your team camel or timbre and
from curvy or sun'll cakes to a really
beautiful summery dress this is actually
the same shape of dress that I wore in
Madrid I don't know if you guys remember
my material outfit Diaries unlinked here
I can I wore a beautiful dress remove
iron Vince gorgeous little detail well
this is the same but in a periwinkle
color which is just such a beautiful
shade really big fan of this card this
season's that have the most beautiful
drape to it I'm hoping it's the same cut
because that previous one just fits so
so beautifully really looking forward to
wearing this on my holiday it just looks
like most beautiful style very elegant
free floaty and it looks too beautiful
on the model on the website uncertified
of that here I can and yeah I keep it on
my Instagram and you'll see me wearing
this over in Italy next week and last
but not least I thought there was a lot
more here in some reason but this seems
to gone by pretty quickly I picked up a
pair of sandals I just really loved the
tassel detail I know they're very
slapped at the language they speak
another packaging but I thought the
autumnal colors of these like reds and
pinks and oranges just through a really
beautiful transition piece for any late
summer holidays I just saw the colors of
beautiful you've got this gold metallic
almost chain right detail there too then
you look really comfortable as well
you've got this lovely thick band of so
leather least I can get so leather
sometimes it could be real leather
actually but yeah so these are really
beautiful great for the upcoming trip
and for any other autumn winter summer
trips that I go on so that's the final
piece in my just interrupting your video
because I totally forgot to show you
these beautiful boots which I also
picked up from of Ireland forgot to
include them in the hall because they
were on the side separately I've not
worn these yet but I think now going to
be so so practical and so versatile for
lots of different autumn outfits really
nice heel height as well and I love this
patent and then you've got this gold bar
and then suede these were fifty pounds
which don't think is too bad and I've
always had really good luck with River
Island shoes great quality so yeah
really big fan of these as well back to
the normal haul I'm really so
I had more bear but I guess that is
still a pretty big haul split between
two orders so I hope you guys enjoyed
