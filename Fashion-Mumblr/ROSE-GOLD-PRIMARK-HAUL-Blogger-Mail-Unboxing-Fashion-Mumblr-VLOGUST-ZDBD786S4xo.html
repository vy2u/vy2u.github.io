kind of Greece character with my
sunglasses in my hat so I decided to do
another daily vlog today soon as you
guys already enjoyed my last one and
yeah I do really enjoy daily vlogging
today kind of like a normal day
pretty much I'm about to go into town
I'm going to get my hair colored as you
can see I'm going a little bit brown on
the top there so I'm going to Daniel
Galvin in Selfridges because they've
just launched a new blonde experience so
they're going to make me a little bit
blonder I also just filmed some clips
for a video that's coming your way very
very soon all about how you can minimize
your makeup verdict and only use 7
products I've only got seven products on
the whole of my face including powder so
yes if you like this makeup look out for
that I think I'm gonna call it like
makeup for beginners or something along
those lines that should be quite
interesting so yeah I'm gonna head into
town in about 15 minutes I've got a
video uploading I've been really
production this morning and I'm just
finishing unpacking because I think it's
so bad I've just left a pile of things
in the corner I haven't finished
unpacking yet from Mykonos which is very
unlike me normally I'm SuperDuper
organized and I just saw bikini and it
reminded me of a very funny story to
tell you guys so this is the bikini in
question you might have seen it on my
Instagram I will insert picture here of
me wearing it it snaps in beautiful
bikini but it did remind me of a rather
embarrassing story which actually soft
and gentle wanted me to share this story
with you guys live on vlog as part of
their soft and gentle moment series so
it seems like a perfect opportunity so
basically this bikini is really good for
tanning because obviously it doesn't
have any straps well you can put straps
on it and these little modules and
personally I prefer to wear it without
straps so don't get tan lines and
obviously on the back I don't want to
get any tan lines either so when we are
on the boats in a Croatia
I had the bikini on and as you do when
you're sunbathing I am taking to the
back you can pretty see where the story
is going and if you've watched my
Croatia vlogs you
remember when I was talking about the
secret and how I wanted to summon the
Dolphins I wanted dolphins to come so
when the Dolphins did come I was
sunbathing and typical it feels like
what happened in American sitcom stood
up forgot that my bikini was unstrapped
and boobs all over the place luckily
I've always not vlogging on snapchatting
at that moment although that would it's
been quite quite a good snapchat for you
would have made it to you've been framed
but yeah the boobs are one show
everybody was on the top boat of the top
deck of the boat watching the dolphins
and there I was and all night and the
glory or lack thereof I have seen
through the running joke recently the
embarrassing things happen it to all of
us
and I'm packing my suitcase saw this
reminded me
yeah the soft and gentle body balance
collection soft and gentle is a really
good brand that really understands the
female body they understand that
embarrassing things can happen and all
that jazz and they've created their body
balance range so I'm a taking so much IQ
switching arms they've created their
body balance range full intimate care
and also just all-over body care and you
guys already know from my favorites
video what's a fan of the turn one
shower at shave a mousse I am this is
also on the holiday topics a really good
one to take on holiday because obviously
you want to like keep everywhere
exfoliated and for really close shave so
this is a really good one to pack on
holiday this is actually a brand new
bottle I've got this one from boots I
would always recommend taking this kind
of product with you on holiday because
it's not going to upset your skin if
you've got sensitive skin then it's not
going to cause any like ingrown hair
bumps or anything like that and for me
as I said in my favourites video it's
just really good for shaving and not
irritating any intimate areas if you
know what I mean so my video by the
looks of it has finally uploaded it is
my on
loaded yet 95% come on yes soon as
that's uploaded which is going to be in
a couple of moments I'm gonna head into
town it's looking like it's going to be
a beautiful day I may even be able to
sunbathe outside and definitely won't be
having any repeat circumstances of what
happened on holiday but yeah fingers
crossed my head isn't taped to it on
today previously it's taken like six
hours so I'm gonna head into town and
take my laptop with me so my super
doctor in the hair salon and I'll take
you guys with me let's go
okay I'm in the salon potentially most
people has online at the scene on the
third floor of subject
got pasted myself I have the lovely
Tommy time I have seen your progress and
he's going to make my bungalow more
natural so I don't have this route of
action going much longer and he's gonna
put some tiny data bits but more like a
muted cell fund it through my hair
really exactly the answer
finish up Daniel Calvin isn't very big
voluminous and very blond which is
actually Wednesday
I'm just heading out now so now they've
got like big garish house that everyone
don't want to go home so I think I'm
going to go to a couple of spots of
doing that book signing here
hey guys I just got home I am looking
SuperDuper shiny I'm not sure when the
last time that I've logged was I think I
maybe showed you a clip at the NAS event
it wasn't really a vlogging kind of
atmosphere as I didn't pick up the
camera too much but I had my makeup
topped up by the NARS makeup artist she
put on the matte sheer glow and some of
the new blusher oh and new bronzer and
that was really good fun I saw Maddie
which was nice to have a little catch up
and yes I stayed there for about half an
hour it's been a tiring afternoon and
and then I very quickly went into
Primark
don't normally go when it's not 8
o'clock in the morning because I tend to
find it a little bit stressful in there
but needs must I needed to get some
wrapping paper because Charlie's
birthday tomorrow
and I've got a few presses that I need
to wrap I'm standing right in front of
the window and it's kind of like blue
lighting outside so that's why I look a
little bit like an alien right now so
yeah I will show you what else I picked
up from a Primark as a few like rose
gold things a bit of a rose gold haul
behind me as you can see it's a bit of a
mess Charlie very kindly went to dawdle
for me so I've got quite a few bits and
bobs to pick up not to pick up to open
so that we could do that together
because I'm aware that today's been
quite important I hyping it up to be an
exciting day this morning and I also
obviously went back to Selfridges wanted
to get Charlie something in there with
his birthday but they didn't have it so
I ended up just buying myself a new set
of Muji drawers
I mean it's six so I have a little salt
out my lips to carry in a second so let
me first show you what I got from
Primark sorry about the lighting it's
because it's just about even that dark
outside it's like that time of day when
it's weird lighting so as well as the
wrapping paper which is boring and you
don't need to see I got some rose gold
items
this is a rose gold massive body on
bronzing brush so this is ginormous
makeup brush which I plan to use to buff
in my fake tan on my body because sadly
in my holiday tan is disappearing very
quickly so pick that one up so got some
rose gold eyelash curlers I thought for
a pound I couldn't really go wrong up
with rose gold eyelash colors and they
look quite similar to mine tweezerman
ones sticking with a makeup brush theme
I also got one of these sponge brushes I
was watching a makeup tutorial from an
American youtuber the other day and she
used a sponge on a stick to apply her
foundation and it looked beautiful so I
thought I'd give that a go then I got
some mini Primark version of beauty
blenders I don't understand why sponges
are always so expensive to pound 50 of
those I was expecting on to about 50 P
but never mind
rose gold nail scissors because they
were rose gold I have no other excuse
and then I got two sets of rose gold
coat hangers which are creepy ones
because I only have the you know normal
style ones and finally rose gold pencil
sharpener because randomly I seem to
have so many pencils lying around that
have blunts like actual writing pencils
so I thought I'd get that and finally as
I always do any go to Primark I got some
cotton pads so I really like that
Primark ones are stitched together at
the tops I don't like all fluff open
that's my Primark haul now let's attack
today's bloggers mail
okay here we go it doesn't look too
appetizing all chucked on the bed like
this I'll quickly whiz you through bits
and pieces so first thing I opened was
this sadly it's broken the little top
and plastic bits come off the bow but
it's Estee Lauder's new modern news
perfume oh oh dear you silly boy
you can't help mommy at the moment
there's no roofie you want the bit it's
all silk look at your snaps me distracts
me so yeah this is the new perfume

slightly fresher kind of a little bit
younger gosh version of their modern
Muse perfume look I used to do that yes

the morning then I have an exfoliator
from arc skincare I've not tried this
product before so I will let you know
how I get along with that wait come on

tricky so new exfoliator from arc
skincare I haven't tried this brand
before so I'm gonna give that a go and I
don't know how you like that they're
actually quite hurt to stop it this I'm
not sure what this is from Bobby Brown
it's got some pencils on the box let's
stop let's have a look so we have four
pencils retouching face pencils I guess
these are like stick concealers that you
can highlight or conceal a little
contour with I have a play with those
tomorrow morning have a look on my
snapchat if you'd like to see how I get
along with those and also from Bobby
Brown I've got some new lipsticks I
think these are slightly more matte down
that there are nourishing lipsticks
beautiful shade kind of like a rosy
Brown and a beautiful fuchsia color
Thank You Bobby
and also from Bobby retouching powder
which I need to use right now cuz I'm
super shiny this is in the shade Rose so
I guess it's gonna quite pinky maybe I
can use it as a blusher as well
interesting not sure how you retouch
with a pink powder we will find out what
else I have a new instant conditioner
from the teeth repair and restores it's
not a dry shampoo it's kind of dry
conditioner I guess so you can just add
it to the end of your hair it's getting
a bit dry good for festival from Too
Faced I have their royal oil coconut oil
body bronzer haven't tried that before
but that sounds amazing let's see what
this looks like

all over your legs for a bit of a
bronzey Sheen I bet it smells amazing
also from Too Faced we have their
sweethearts perfect flush flush I have
the bronzer perfect heart and it's just
most beautiful kind of highlight eesh
