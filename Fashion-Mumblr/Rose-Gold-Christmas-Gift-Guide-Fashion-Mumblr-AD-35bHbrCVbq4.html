channel I hope you're having a really
fabulous day today and thank you so much
for joining me for today's video today
I'm going to be doing a bit of a
Christmas / Black Friday mashup because
as you know right now there are some
insane sales going on right now I have a
post live on my blog all about a few of
my favorite sale picks and also some
tips on how to shop the sales in the
best way so I'll leave that linked down
below if you would like to check that
out and today's video is going to be a
Christmas gift guide but with Black
Friday sales in mind so if you've got
anybody to shop for on your Christmas
list that you haven't picked up a gift
for yet today is the perfect opportunity
due to the incredible discounts and
offers that are available this year I
wanted to do something a little bit
different to my usual beauty gift guide
give God for him gift guide for her I
wanted to switch it up a little bit and
I decided that for my first gift guide
that when you guys are seen today I'm
going to do a rose gold Christmas gift
guide you guys know how much I love rose
gold it's almost a little bit of a joke
how much I'm obsessed with rose gold
whether that's in my beauty products or
my accessories or in my photos it's
something that I'm a pretty fond of so I
know that I'm not alone I know that a
lot of bloggers and a lot of you guys
also love rose gold so that is the theme
for today's gift guide video the bits
and bobs that I've chosen are really
varied in their price points so
hopefully there's something for
everybody and they're also just a little
bit unusual I'm actually really chuffed
with the bits and bobs that I've pulled
together for this gift guide and I think
it will hopefully help you to tick off a
few of those really hard to buy for
people that you may have on your list of
people to buy for this Christmas so
without further ado let's get started
with the first item this one is
something that I personally have not
seen on a Christmas gift guide before
and it is an oral-b genius 9000 rose
gold toothbrush the reason why I
to include this is because a toothbrush
for me is something that can be a little
bit of a luxury but not something that I
would necessarily slash out a ton of
money on for myself but as a gift no one
would say no to a seriously
snazzy toothbrush and this one is
seriously snazzy but before I tell you
about the details of this amazing rose
gold toothbrush I should let you know
that the reason why I'm including this
one today especially is because it is in
the most insane sale for Black Friday is
better than half-price exclusive to
boots so don't hang around if you want
to get someone this then I would suggest
getting it today while it's on sale I
will leave a direct link down below to
this and all the other pieces in my gift
guide so this one in particular is the
oral-b genius 9000 rose gold tooth brush
and it is the rose gold version of their
most advanced toothbrush ever which is
their genius 9000 and as you can see it
has had a rose gold makeover which
excites me more than a tooth brush
potentially should excite me but I mean
it's pretty beautiful I will open it up
and show you even the box itself like
I've never had a toothbrush come in a
box like this before they normally just
come in that little cardboard plastic
thing which is absolutely fine but this
is just something else and it really is
a lot more technologically advanced than
anything that I have seen or used before
not only is it beautiful so anybody
receiving this at Christmas would
probably instantly fall in love with how
wonderful it looks but it's also a
really useful gift to give as well
because everybody cares about oral
hygiene whether they talk about it or
not I think teeth and your smile are so
important you guys know how I've been
investing in my teeth a lot recently
I've been going through invisible braces
I've had my teeth contoured because I
really appreciate the value of an
amazing smile so this for me will just
be the absolute perfect gift so let me
tell you why it's particularly snazzy
first of all the actual head the
toothbrush head itself is designed based
on the professional dentist tool so it
has maximum cleaning and whitening
benefits it gently polishes away
surface stains you can see a picture of
it here to reveal a healthy and white
smile and talking of white smiles excuse
the box which Dexter has just chewed you
could also provide this as a stocking
filler this is the oral-b 3d white luxe
perfection toothpaste I think if you're
going to go all out and treat someone to
an incredibly luxurious toothbrush then
why not treat them to the toothpaste as
well what I really like about this one
is that it is whitening but it's really
gentle it contains dissolvable
microbeads which gently polish away any
stains on the teeth and in fact I think
I read that there is a 100% improvement
in the whiteness of the smile within up
to 100% improvement and the whiteness of
your smile within three days of using
this so very very effective back to the
main toothbrush itself I feel that if
you know someone that potentially has it
all you don't really want to risk buying
them a beauty product just in case it's
not quite the right thing or you don't
know their clothes size or they
generally just seem to have everything I
think this is such a good gift idea and
as I said earlier potentially not the
kind of thing you pulled out on for
yourself a luxury toothbrush but it's
something that you can almost guarantee
they're going to love and use every
single day so it makes a really
fantastic gift so not only does the
toothbrush it's outlook good but it also
does a fantastic job as well and I think
giving someone the gift of a fabulous
white smile is something that money just
can't buy a second time very
enthusiastic about this I'm such a teeth
lover and I really know the importance
of having a smile that you can be proud
of
so something else really cool about this
is it has a triple sensor technology or
triple pressure sensor technology but
basically what it does is if you're
brushing too hard which can be damaging
to teeth and gums it will alert you and
basically train you to brush your teeth
in the optimum way as well as that you
can personalize it so if you're a fan of
pink or green or blue or turquoise you
couldn't basically change the color of
the LED lights around the ring and
really make it your own so say you're
personally abaya for is one of five
sisters and they all want a rose gold
tooth brush you can pass
it's said that each one looks a little
bit different and it's fun to
personalize things so that's another
really cool feature also in here and
plus I really like that it comes in this
big box it's just a really satisfying
thing to open but also inside if you're
wondering why it's so big for a
toothbrush it comes with a very snazzy
travel case which not only protects and
charges your toothbrush but also charges
your phone so anybody that gets excited
over technology like I do will be very
very excited by that and there's also an
app that goes with the toothbrush it's
basically the most insanely cool
toothbrush ever and I really do think
that it's a very good gift personally
it's something that I would love to
receive I know Charlie said that a few
years ago one of his best friends dad
who was a dentist gave her an oral-b
toothbrush and he still uses it to this
day he absolutely loves it and he always
keeps saying how it's such a good gift
because it's not something that you
would have treated himself to but he was
so so grateful for it so this as you can
imagine with all of those features it's
not a cheap toothbrush so definitely
make sure that you make the most of the
insane discount better than half-price
for Black Friday available today so yeah
that's my first one a rose gold
toothbrush mean how cool is that
I definitely yeah I'm definitely very
excited about that and would love to
receive something like this for
Christmas my next rose gold gift is a
pair of earphones from skinny-dip and
these are the kind of thing that
basically everybody would love the
skinny dip off such a cool brand but
sometimes you may not know what size
phone someone's got it may be a little
bit risky getting them a six phone case
because you never know they might be
getting a seven Christmas exertion etc
but earphones are something that
everyone can use and these ones are
really really beautiful they have got a
rose gold headband and then at the bits
that go over your ears have got this
kind of 3d actually looks like gold
chunks but they're actually 3d it's not
just like a pattern so they're very very
snazzy very sparkly great for anybody
that loves listen to their music if you
know any bloggers or youtubers that like
to put their earphones on when their
heads
then this is just a really really
stylish gift to give these are not that
expensive I can't remember the exact
price but all the information and links
will be down below along with links to
buy I pick these up on ASOS along with a
clothing order so really is simple and
quick to add to your present pile if
you've got a last-minute gift to get and
I don't know what aces are doing today
on Black Friday but they normally do
something so I will leave wording either
on a screen or down below in the
description box depending on what kind
of sales they've got on but yeah I just
thought these are a really cool gift I
saw them I kind of fell in love with
them straight away I may be just keeping
these myself I don't know they're also a
really good gift for those kind of just
incase occasions if you're if you've got
some friends over and you don't know if
you're doing gifts this is just a really
cool thing that everyone would love so
and I seem to have as a backup present
please tell me I'm not the only person
that does that and then of my next one
you guys might recognize this but I had
to include it within my rose gold
Christmas gift guide it is a
personalized Real Techniques makeup
brush so you may know a beauty leather
that has everything already but does she
have a makeup brush with her initials on
I doubt it
so this is part of the Real Techniques
bold metals collection and if you
watched my boots Emporium vlog then you
will probably have seen this being
personalized in action but basically the
personalization is a service that has
been offered in the Boots Emporium and
I'll leave information about the
Emporium down below but there are I
think six or seven emporiums across the
UK but there are the services such as
personalization in more stores than that
and a few of the stores have a
personalization machine where basically
once you've purchased the item you can
then pay a little bit extra to get it
personalized you can get your initials
along the top or you can get like JC
fashion manga written all the way down
the bottom so many things and the
important you can get personalized but I
think this is just such a lovely
stocking filler or gift from boots then
if you know anybody with a slightly more
refined taste or maybe your
or your older sister also is as obsessed
with rose gold as we are then this is
the most beautiful present it is the Tom
Ford orchid slave fragrance in the rose
gold packaging this is just the most
elegant feminine fabulous fragrance it
really does smell so luxurious in fact
I'm going to treat myself to a spritz
now oh that is such a gorgeous fragrance
and so instantly recognizable like when
someone's wearing Tom Ford you can tell
straight away because it's such an
iconic fragrance I absolutely adore the
scent
I basically love anything from Tom Ford
and if you just want to really impress
someone or really treat them to
something fabulous then this is such a
beautiful gift to give especially if
they are a rose gold lover something a
little bit more affordable perhaps if is
a friend someone a uni housemate or
something this is just a really cute
Christmas gift from new look and it is a
rose gold drinking jar I like to think
that you will fill this with hot
chocolate maybe what are they called a
freak shake
we like whipped cream and donuts I can
definitely imagine that kind of drink
being a very beautifully presented in
something like this so it is a jar and
you can unscrew the top vacuum using
some of my muscles there and then as you
can see really big inside good for long
walks maybe because it does have this
sealing top so you're not going to spill
it anywhere but really affordable from
new look although I did actually also
get this from ASOS so I guess whichever
retailer has the better Black Friday
offer is the one you could go to to pick
something like Lissa another affordable
piece which I just had to throw in there
this is from West Elm and it is a rose
gold sausage dog Christmas tree
decoration and I just thought of had
include this because for some people you
know the people that say don't buying
anything but you do want to buy them
something I think a tree charm is just
such a lovely small but potentially a
very thoughtful gift if someone buys me
anything sausage dog related then I am a
happy bunny so this just ticked off two
things rose gold and sausage dog so I
would definitely recommend checking out
West Elm for rose gold tree decorations
because they have a ton of them
then if you know someone a little bit
better you're really confident that you
understand their fashion preferences
then I thought I would include this
because these are a pair of shoes from
ASOS and once again maybe not the kind
of thing that you treat yourself to
because they're pretty special they're
pretty festive but a really lovely gift
if you do know someone that likes to
dress up and likes rose gold I thought
they were absolutely stunning and I'm
not gonna lie I bought these myself but
because they rose gold I thought I would
stick them in this video as well I'm
gonna be wearing these with a black
dress on Christmas Day just to really
elevate my look and add my favorite
color into the mix but they're very
affordable I think these are about 25
pounds so a really lovely way to treat
someone to new pair of shoes if you know
their size and if you are confident of
their fashion preferences and then last
but not least and this may appear in
more than one gift guide this season
because as you know already I am
obsessed with it it is these are Weaver
makeup bag case and I'm including this
one because it has got rose gold
hardware on it it's got the rose gold
branding and the rose gold zips up at
the top and it is just the most fabulous
gift for any beauty lover at the moment
it is filled with my traveling
essentials because I'm heading it to
Barbados tomorrow so it's filled with
all my bits and bobs but if you would
like to have a tour of this or even just
see what's inside it includes all these
fabulous makeup brushes which are also
rose gold then I will leave my blogger
mail and boxing video down below where I
open it up and show it to you in its
unused glory but I had to include this
because I think it is a fabulous gift
it's not cheap it's close to the 200
pound mark but a really wonderful gift
for a beauty lover if you really want to
spoil someone then this is such a
fabulous idea so there you have it my
rose gold Christmas gift guide I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
enjoyed something a little bit different
to the usual gift guides if you are as
much of a rose gold lover as I am then
hopefully you will have really
appreciated this little rose gold edit
