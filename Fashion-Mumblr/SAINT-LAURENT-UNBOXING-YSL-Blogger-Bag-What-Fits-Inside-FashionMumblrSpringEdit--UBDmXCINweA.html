joining me for the next installment of
the fashion mandala spring edit if you
are new to my channel then you may not
be aware that this week I'm doing a new
video every single day to celebrate the
upcoming launch of spring is my favorite
season and I'm doing a spring themed
video every single day this week so if
that sounds like the kind of thing that
you would enjoy and please hit the
subscribe button down here I'm doing
beauty videos fashion videos trend
videos unboxing videos and lots more so
hopefully you guys will stick around for
that today's video is going to be a new
spring handbag unboxing and the bag in
question you already know from the title
is the wire sell or seen along vlogger
bag so I received this couple of weeks
ago I got it from Farfetch'd calm which
is one of my favorite retailers for
buying designer online and loved the
selection of they've got and despite the
fact that the products are pulled from
various retailers across the world
I never have any problems with shipping
the returns are really great and it's
just a really good place to finding the
bits that you've had your eye on so I've
had my eye on the single wrong bag for
quite a long time the blogger bag is
correct me if I'm wrong but it is the
most affordable of all the same anon
bags and I just think they're so
adorable and I could not resist picking
one up when I saw that the baby pink
shade had come back in stock so I've not
actually opened this yet but thought I
would share the moment with you guys
inside it's beautifully wrapped up they
did come in a far fetch box but this
packaging it says exist on it so I'm
guessing that that is the name of the
boutique that sent this to me so let's
open it up and see what's inside
you should try both the bottle
so we have the iconic black singer on
Paris dustbag inside this will be my
third later on dustbag--
I also have the sack to shore I believe
it's called and also the monogrammed
clutch bag so this is going to be my
third singer on bag and I feel like I've
got a really good collection now I've
got a large of a really nice evening bag
and then this of course going to be the
tiny one rather concerning this kind of
looks like a security tag are getting it
is I can use two three sturdy label so
very well protected it's in this kind of
bubble wrap and then sometimes done here
she is such a beautiful color it's kind
of a powder pink let's take off the rest
of the good which is quits off so here
she is in all her unbox glory as you can
see absolutely tiny I have a very small
head compared to my head is very small
you've got this very thin strap it's not
chain it's just double backed about
leather incredibly thin but I guess
it'll really to support it because
you're not going to be able to fit much
in here you've got a gold yellow gold
zip and then the zip has a very small
chain and then this little tassel detail
which is not removable
it just is this on the back you've got
this pocket which is empty but really
good for boys the cards potentially of
course you've got the Polish yellow gold
wire cell logo on the front and then
inside we have got the little swatch of
leather this is the exact thing leather
that the bag is made out of and I know a
few people are often like what do I do
with it it's I think it's for cleaning
purposes so if heaven forbid you were to
get a stain on your beautiful handbag
you could test your cleaning method on
the jewel square before risking the bag
so that's what this is for also inside
is this little envelope which I
we'll just be my authenticity details
and it's also come with some stuffing
inside which I'm going to remove so now
that our papers out I can see the inside
here we have got two little slips which
are almost reminiscent of what you'd
find inside a purse so I guess the
meaning of this bag obviously is not to
be like your everyday handbag it's more
an extended purse that you can wear
which i think is really handy if you
don't like carrying all your bits and
bobs down with you you just want to have
your essentials and this way you can
keep your coins and your cards in a
really safe place and always on your
body so I guess that's definitely what
I'm going to use it for rather than the
actual handbag personally I love having
a small statement handbag there's
nothing better than my walking around
your hands-free and not having to lug
around master packages but hopefully
this will encourage me to be a little
bit more minimalist the nether is a
sponge another it's not pebbled it's not
that Saffiano leather so this will get
scratched and it will stain if you're
not careful with light colored bags it's
always so important to be super casual
to wearing dark jeans or new denim
because you may get a like a friction
mark on the back here I learned the hard
way with my first Mulberry MIDI bags
that's denim a little transfer onto
light-colored leathers they be super
careful if you're thinking about getting
this color I want to talk about the name
of this bag because it's called the
white belt blogger bag which I think
caused a lot of curiosity let's say when
it was first announced I was definitely
like oh my gosh have wives oh really
named bag after bloggers because of
course bags are normally named after
like celebrities or fashion icons or
street names or just random fancy words
that help with SEO and whatnot but this
is called the blogger bag which is just
so interesting as a blogger myself and I
was just immediately like hot why has he
done that is it to poke fun of others or
is it a kind of homage to bloggers I
really don't know but
there's Bethenny a few theories out
there my favorite theory and the one
that I think I agree with the most is
the fact that bloggers loggers obviously
gives designer bags quite a lot of
exposure across Instagram and our
platforms and the two bags that are most
featured by vloggers are in fact the
wire sell monogrammed bag and the
Valentina rostered ironically both of
which I have and I don't have millions
of comebacks as you know I probably have
seven designer handbags in total and I
do have those too which are the most
Instagram combos and they're both very
small and they both have something quite
a quiet on them like logo or Stubbs
so maybe Eddie's team on who is the
designer of the block bag maybe he was
trying to capitalize on that and felt
that bloggers would be really drawn in
by its size it fits in an Instagram
Square and the fact that it is quite
obvious with this logo like I'm not
really a logo person she says holding a
logo covered bag it's very clear that it
is a designer bag but it is the most
affordable of the wires out handbag so I
think that that would make it very
attractive to a lot of bloggers a lot of
people who have aspirations to be
blogging on their instagrams because by
wearing something like this which is 645
pounds you can really instantly add that
designer impact to your outfit you could
be wearing a full outfit of Topshop Zara
River Island and then as long as you've
chosen wisely and you add this bag at
your finishing touch it really elevates
an outfit so I think for a lot of people
that are really starting starting to
invest in a designer bag wardrobe this
is a great place to start because it's
affordable as far as designer bags go of
course it's not affordable and on that
note I think this has gone up by about
200 pounds which this earth came out and
last year designer bags tend to do that
based on their availability and demand
and this has certainly been very much in
demand so I guess that's my theory as to
why it's called the blogger bag but if
you guys have heard any other theories
will have your own
years definitely let me know in the
comments below so I'd be really
interested to hear your thoughts I guess
it could to see the fact that you
recognized the growth of bloggers and
wanted to almost make a tribute to that
to show relevancy I really don't know
but I think it's great that a bag is
called the blogger bag is also the
camera bag which is a very similar size
I get I think it might be a little bit
bigger but on that note I'm now going to
see what fits inside first of all I
can't resist any longer it seems
microphone sits inside because I have an
iPhone 7 plus so let's give it a go
so here's my phone here's the bag I'm
like in this guy's I'm not sure this is
gonna fit
hold on would help if I actually opened
it and some done got a case on as well
oh my gosh oh it's going to distort the
bag I'm really having to force the sins
would not be like an easy walk it in
walk it out type situation you know what
it does just about fit but I'm not sure
I can close the zip I'm not going to try
it so don't want to break the zip not
exactly little bit of a problems if you
have got an iPhone 6 or an iPhone 7 plus
the giant brick of the phone it will not
fit inside if you are willing to risk it
I guess you could put it in the backpack
but probably not the best idea this
sounds really bad but I've just had
another thought as to why because we
called the blogger bag because we have
our phones in our hands 99% of the time
I mean how often this is so bad but how
often do you actually put your phone in
the bag for a long period of time I know
that I normally actually walk around
holding my phone that's for the stop
like that's really bad but maybe that's
another reason why I called the blogger
bag because you need to put their phone
in their bag when it's always in the
hand another blogger essential is of
course a vlogging camera this is my g7 X
so I log on with the clip down screen I
also vlog on my little pen but that
definitely wouldn't fit in here
luckily I'm pretty sure yeah so the
canon g7x
fits in there was quite a lot of room
and still plenty of room for makeup my
cards
a passport would fit in here not that
you carry that around with you every
single day their memory cards a battery
charger that would also fit in here and
so yeah I think as a camera bag and
perhaps a few essentials like a slim
card wallet and makeup that would
definitely fit in here it's just really
the phone if that doesn't fit so yeah
overall I think this is a really
fabulous value to looking to make a
first step into the designer market or
perhaps you're looking to treat yourself
to and use smaller bags because you want
to do really elevate your everyday
outfit to think this is an absolutely
lovely decision and choice for that kind
of reason the bag itself is really
beautiful it's very classic design and
that's what I'm all about when it comes
to buying new designer bags I would
never go for one that's instantly going
to go out of style a few months later
I'm all about the bags that I can reach
for in years to come I mean this is
super plane itself it's a squash square
with a passel with a logo on and that's
really not going to grab style so I
don't feel too heartbroken to part with
super 45 pounds for this it is having
said that a lot of money for a very
small amount of leather but hopefully
because of its size it will just go with
so many outfits I'll get a lot of use
out of it I'm all about that price per
wear so hopefully I'll let you guys know
in a few weeks or months time whether I
feel this has been used as part of
numerous of my outfit so that is my
unboxing first impressions and what fits
inside of the blogger bag from Saint
Laurent and really hope you guys enjoyed
this video let me know if you like this
type of video I know that luxury videos
aren't everyone's cup of tea but that's
fine I do a lot of affordable fashion
