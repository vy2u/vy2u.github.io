I'm here with the lovely Katie who is
creating a masterpiece but means to come
in the bathroom at the moment and we're
here with Nina Ricci fragrances for the
launch of their new lunar fragrances and
we're here to enjoy a lovely couple of
days just relaxing and having fabulous
activities we started the day super
bright and early with a workout the
couples workout with the fabulous Carly
Rowena we worked up a heck of a scratch
and we learned some really cool couples
workout routine bits and bobs and then
we had a scrumptious breakfast
downstairs so the day is off to a
fabulous start Katy now I've got a
gorgeous room so we are up in kind of
one of the turrets of the house the most
exciting bit is actually out here so we
have this cute little balcony area like
a bathtub slash trough looks like a
Jacuzzi behind me and then a sunbathing
in bed it's a little bit gray at the
moment so we're not gonna be doing any
sunbathing but it's a fabulous area and
then let me show you our bathroom
because that is seriously spectacular to
get the shot ladies and gentlemen Katy
so funny so but let me tell you what
she's photographing because this is the
actual bathroom and I'm about to have a
bubble bath Katy has made it super
Instagram friendly so excited dumped in
that and then across the hallway we've
got a non bath bathroom which is just
terribly Instagram Abell so yeah I'm
looking forward to sharing with you guys
what we get up to this weekend but for
now it's bath time possibly the most
sumptuous bath I think I've ever had

insta shot and insert it here so you can
see Katy's marvellous photography work

meze platter and antipasti platter and
two glasses and protector

we've got the fabulous views behind us
and we've got a delicious lunch waiting
for us they're feeling very very lucky
to have opportunities like this we're
just saying we never in a million years
we thought that no jobs would lead to
this we are making the most of every
single moment it's literally everything
just check time and we have one minute
till hydrate man so we're just rushing
down to the spot now I need to hope that
my goodness so Katie and I are about to
have a mud treatment so I think we're
basically gonna have applied to our
bodies it's going to draw out the toxins
and I'm gonna be all lovely and smooth
ready for the flower boards mad
back in the room now after our spa
treatment and it was so much fun how
much fun we had we had to wet ourselves
first No and then we had to cover
ourselves in the different types of mud
there was a separate mud face obviously
the most gentle and for bringing out all
the toxins in our body in our face and
then we had a month for our arms and our
torso and our back and then the most
intense mud which was also like anti
cellulite for our legs and then when
we'd applied it huh yeah fingers crossed
and then we pressed a little switch on
the wall and the room turned into like a
steam room and it was like her'll
fragrances aromatic fragrance filled the
room and it was about 15 minutes that we
were just enjoying the steam we couldn't
even see each other kiss team was so
intense and then finally the lights
slowly started to come back on they were
like twinkly lights in the ceiling and
suddenly the shower heads above our
heads over sitting just burst into
action and freezing cold water came out
to shock our bodies and then we just
rinsed it all off and came back to the
room had a shower and now we are busy
creating flat lays on the bed while we
still have a little bit more lights and
we're gonna start getting ready for the
ball tonight
and we are here - Katy is gone so Luna
and flowers for the very feminine Jenny
let me show you down the room is just
spectacular
