finished look so I've just curled the
ends of my hair with my ghd's and then
I'm wearing my favorite dress of the
moment I think I'm gonna be living in
this or the summer and I will ask April
very kindly she doesn't mind taking an
outfit video for me later I can show you
it properly but as always links to
everything will be down below so I'm
going to now head to the born in
Hollingsworth or Holdings Brook I always
get a wrong building I'm getting my
nails done and it is a meeting I promise
it's not just a manager a really good
day to day for things like that and yes
that's it going see you later my babies
look at this little face is my Dickie
boy is such a big boy now how's my
brownie my big war oh I like it I like
it
okay so third meeting of the day is done
I'm now in a packed day with April and
we are on route to the YouTube offices
for very excited about us have been
there before
and hopefully if we get there in time
we're stuck in a little bit of traffic
we're going to have a tour of YouTube
offices just have our nails done a salon
for rose gold I would for a blue color
which is slightly unusual for me and yes
but a pink again I love that kind of
though stephannie gonna get another one
so on our way to youtube we're going to
meet the girls from Estee Lauder
we're going to have a tour of the
offices meet or the makeup artist yeah
looking forward having it around and
offering you guys along the tour in the
room
welcome to starfish your walk oh all
right so we are here in the Google head
offices we just had a tour at the
YouTube space downstairs and I cannot
believe how many services they offer
here apparently once you have not
apparently once you have more than ten
thousand subscribers you can come and
use their Studios their incredible
camera equipment and you can even have
the guys helping you with like Final Cut
premiere just basically giving you
tutorials on how to edit your videos
like a pro so I'm definitely going to
making the most of that I need all the
help I can get so yeah it's fascinating
having a look around and I also just met
the Estee Lauder
Pro makeup artist so I'm going to be
chatting to you in a second giving them
my tips on how to amplify their social
media how to create video content and
just hopefully get them excited about
creating makeup videos because these
guys that they have the pros they know
everything there is to know about sale
Automator products and we want them to
share what they know where their
audiences so that's one about to do now
and we just walked through the Google
lunch area
I always hear people joking about how
when you join Google you gain the Google
pounds because the food looks incredible
so we're going to go and have some nice
lunch now and then it's time for the
talk to begin so I'm going to ask April
very kindly if she will film a few clips
so you can see what's going down but
some and rambling from nervous but let's
go
okay so this pork is done I think it
went pretty well you back then
yet they learn a lot I think I think
they were quite responsive and I will
not be on Instagram lines they bought
they all like to indulge it yeah I with
Instagram liveing the whole time as well
and in April was picking out all the
questions then we did a little Q&amp;amp;A at
the end so now we're back where we
started
at YouTube space which of course is in
Google offices which are there and we're
going to go in to speak survive in there
hopefully they're going to give us
information about how we can select
among classes because they teach you how
to editing software and I've got your
questions about my accounts since you're
going hack so yeah let's go and have you
what we can learn
okay so April 9 made our way up the
street such a beautiful day we both just
for having a giggle because we're
complaining about the Sun being in our
eyes and we both got sunglasses on our
hands and yet we supposed to keep the
mat keep our hair in place God we are
very changing with each other so now
we've just been engagements try and find
we've heard about this silk dress and
it's on our hit list so we're now failed
at a thermal circuit so now would be
lining route 7 3
so now we're heading to Regent Street hm
via do you because Athens got her eyes
on some mules so basically the way to go
so yeah hopefully we'll be successful on
our shopping mission and then I might
gonna get my brows done because going
away tomorrow
so let's mission find a dress because
you're not a real blogger if you don't
go to the flower school at Liberty when
you're around Soho and so April have
gone home now I'm going to get on with
my camper in bits and bobs before all
this tomorrow
I'm not going to smell so much more in
power because it is probably the most
awful thing in the world when you're
vlogging by yourself in public so I will
catch up with you guys in a couple of
hours and I'm back home home again
reunited with my boys which house has
been outside working all day are you
darling Charlie Charlie has them
accidentally you've done my Clarins
body lotion to effect a limit I should
quite rest though I think I don't know
if it's because I already had a pack
thing it just sort of time optimized I
didn't I didn't think you're asleep so
he's definitely got baked ham hands cuz
I didn't know he didn't wash your hands
argan oil you might want to use some
bondo Sun Tan eraser so yeah back to the
boys look Charlie's a little bit stinky
you look so round but I'm going to fake
tan later tonight so hopefully I will be
I'm trying to not get the washing in the
background but this is real life we've
got washing all over the house my other
two little boys are charging around the
lawn
taras they just play non-stop people
keep asking how Dexter Rose was Dickens
and honestly it's the best thing we ever
did to Dexter he just plays and plays
with his little brother and they love
each other so much already
I think Dexter is smashing so ferocious
he's loving being an older brother and
it means that Charlie and I are we close
and it means that Charlie and I can get
on with our work because we don't have
Dexter begging us to play with him
anymore instead he just picks on Dickens
don't you my home oh look at my two boys
you so that's what Dexter in Dickens
will be up to for the next couple of
hours and we also got cocoa and new it
here mum's dogs Louie is down here I was
laughing with the girls earlier about
sometimes when you're filming YouTube
videos things do get in the way you do
have distractions and for me it's Luis
snoring because um yes once he starts he
does not stop and then cocoa is being a
little mountain goat up here on the top
of sofas not on the sofa on top of the
sofa you just like muted a mountain yes
don't you go so on the way home I went
to to dawdle and I picked up you blog
about castles just three parcels and and
a nasal order so I'm going to unbox that
with you guys upstairs now and decide if
any of the a soft stuff is appropriate
to take with me because and if I
mentioned but I'm going to Antigua
tomorrow which I'm so excited about so
yeah that's a head upstairs and finish
packing okay once again apologies about
the mess going on behind me and but
blogger mal wise first of all I just
received a lovely parcel from Giorgio
Armani this is their sky DeJoria guide
is your collection as an Eau de Parfum
and then some cat themed products so
these would create a perfect cat eye
we've got eyes to kill pro liner and
fluid eye color film items which sounds
quite intriguing and so I'm guessing
this is going to be very oh well very
very
sin nibs eyeliner I don't wear that much
eyeliner so I would give that a go but
I'm probably not the best at telling you
whether is wonderful or not and then
this or this is rather lovely this is I
think it's one of those that metallic
eye cream oh that looks beautiful
it's definitely going to come with me in
my holiday makeup bag and then we've got
a new fragrance so let's have a look I'm
already wearing as the shorter bronze
goddess I feel like this is going to be
a little bit of fragrance combining and
that's really fresh but I have to say I
feel like I've smelt this before feel
like this is a very familiar fragrance
and I don't want to say it but it does
remind me of a celebrity fragrance or
know it reminds me of it's guarded
remember it's got a fragrances back in
the day and they're like blue and pink
swirly bottle kind of mostly about but
it's really lovely light fragrance and
then we have a blog mail from Rimmel
this is their bronze and sculpt
collection instant tan medium matte so
yeah I'm going to take that with me and
then they've got their radiance brick
shimmer powder this is a shimmering
bronzer amazing from holiday this is
their jus Oh contour stick I'm rubbish
at contouring but sticks are for me the
easiest way to do it and then this is
the palette that we all know and love
the Kate and trio you've got highlight
the bronzer or console and of lashes so
it's just a really handy little palette
a great console for beginners kind of on
the high street
and my final blogger mail is from the
fragrance shop so this is their
discovery Club little mini stats I think
it's five pound a month sexy on a press
release five pound per quarter and you
get samples of the latest fragrance
launches so we have Scott and gentlemen
and me from Givenchy we've caught Oh
another Jian Chi this is live
irresistible
mark shakers Daisy we do think that's a
new launch maybe they've read and
relaunched it
blower they essential i've not smell any
from that brand before
we've got Lacoste Odin across magnetic
and pour l and four homes and then a
little mini nina ricci luna i have the
allotted fragrance so as my blogger mail
very very generous from the brands as
always next I'm going to show you guys
very briefly I'm going to do a very
quick Tryon for Watson here I'm going to
make it very Swift gonna wear this vlog
is already probably about 12 minutes
long and um yet you're probably have now
going to wrap things up pretty soon so
let's get trying okay here is piece
number one it's a very chilled beach
dress really nice length this is from a
brand called surf gypsy and I have
really liked their pieces in the past
just a very easy to throw on piece
really so it last occasion around the
shoulders really easy to fling on over a
bikini it definitely need to trim these
bits I do have something quite similar
to this from Topshop but I feel like
this is a little bit smarter and I was
looking for something to just upgrade my
beach tire so I think I'm going to keep
this one it's not too expensive either
here we have another beach dress this
one is from the brand Tularosa which is
traditionally I think it's actually a
revolve round but they do have a few
bits and bobs on a sauce I do really
really like this I'm in loving the
scalloped detail at the bottom but I
feel like it is quite expensive and to
remind myself of the price as with all
my hauls you guys know the drill I'm
going to leave everything link down
below if you do want to shop anything
but it's like a dressing gown so I did
have to pull it through the side here
which makes it a really nice fit my only
issue with it is the fact that it's
pretty low cut so I guess if you have a
nice bikini on it could be really really
lovely but yeah I do like it I think
it's going to be one of those I'm going
to take it with me with the tags on and
if I don't wear it on this holiday it
means I'm not going to keep it but if I
do wear it then obviously I'll keep it
so it's going to go in the case because
it's seriously cute but still not fully
decided okay so you might recognize this
top it's my Club Monaco one but I
described it to try on with this skirt
so the skirt is what I've got any order
really really like the shape
I have a feeling it's actually River
Island yeah that looks like a river
Island tag to me but yeah I didn't see
this on the river Island website as you
can see I'm on the river Island website
quite a lot but this is beautiful I
think I have to take this top with it a
bit of broth yeah I'm going to have to
take this top with me to wear with it I
don't often wear skirt and top
combinations but really really like this
so yeah this is going to come in the
suitcase obviously guys I would not wear
this top with the houses and but I just
really wanted to show you this top this
is Tularosa and I feel like this is my
dream beach holiday top it's off the
shoulder you've got these like floaty
ruffle lace detail sleeves which are
attached and then this beautiful detail
which is similar to the dress I tried on
earlier at the base color wise obviously
I'm not wearing the right underwears and
wearing one of these wonder bras that
keeps everything in place just like and
you can really see my tan lines from
when I was running a sports bra the
other day but yeah love the top the
trousers I got a few days ago last week
from River Island I love them because
they've got a last occasion waist so
they're really stretchy I will leave the
trousers link down below as well because
I'm going to maybe travel in these
because there is so comfortable
lightweight and yeah perfect traveling
trousers but definitely would not wear
this combination together because I look
like something out of ABBA once again
not combination I'd wear together but
here's another really lovely chilled out
vibe beach top this one is very elastic
so a gust of wind could pretty much
bring this one powering down but it does
have elastic along the bottom here
elastic on sleeves and then elastic here
it does slightly concern me how loose
this is but I feel like this is just a
really easy breezy Beach top I don't
know if it's maybe better if I show it
to you like this yeah you can kind of
see it better in the lighting it is a
really beautiful design I love the kind
of almost raw edge feel of this I think
it is very very pretty and Charlie and I
are also hoping to go to Greece later in
the summer that's really distracting me
you know yeah I feel like this will be
amazing for Greek holidays just as some
denim hot pants on not with tropical
charles's like I'm wearing now massive
fashion fail
fashion blogger
I did not know that Asus stocked All
Saints until I saw this jumper I had to
get it I just fell in love with the
color really really like this slouchy
fit once again I'm going to show you it
this way around because that lighting is
just completely gone now but yeah this
is a really elegant style jumper I think
maybe because I like this so much I
might actually travel just in some
simple gray tracksuit bottoms it is a
nine hours light and remove the t-shirt
on underneath this so I feel like this
is one of those comfy but also cozy and
chic pieces so yeah maybe I'll travel in
this instead the only thing that's
stopping me from traveling in this is
the fact that I'm going to put on a ton
of fake time either tonight or tomorrow
morning and I don't want to ruin this
first time I wear it but I have one more
option for a traveling jumper so let me
know what let me know which one you
think I should go for from ultra chic to
ultra gangster I'm not even going to try
this on because look how ginormous this
is they were sold out of extra small so
I got small but you could fit myself
Charlie
Dexter and Dickens and this jumper is
absolutely gianormous so it's safe to
say I won't be travelling in this so I
think I'm going to travel in the
AllSaints jumper and a white t-shirt
underneath and then some tracksuit
bottoms ok so this video has now done a
full loop I'm back exactly is that where
I started wearing my dressing gown once
again and I think I'm going to wrap
things up here because it's half seven
now all we're going to do oh my god that
smells so good I forgot I remember you
Mon already when I was wearing this this
morning but yes that all I'm going to do
the rest this evening is sort out this
bond sides of clothing and I'm going to
have to repack my suitcase because I
love pretty much everything from my
April Fool aside from the giant jumper
and I want to take it all and yet I'm
only going for three days so definitely
need to have the amount of clothing that
I'm packing with me
so yeah going to do that I'm going to
have dinner I think Charlie's doing some
nice sweet and sour chicken which be
delicious and then I need to have my
pamper shower so I need to exfoliate
again and then just get my body ready
for some fake done because
I will just be fake tanning at this
holiday and wearing sunblock because
yeah all about caring for my skin so
yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video I had a really fabulous day it was
just such an honor to be invited to the
Google offices for a tour and to meet
the pro make parties from Estee Lauder
and I think it's such a fabulous idea
what Estee Lauder doing like these girls
we've got so much knowledge about the
products about makeup trends and how to
wear the Estee Lauder products so a
brilliant idea to encourage them to get
on YouTube and be creating content on
their instagrams we've already all got
beautiful Instagram feeds in fact I'm
going to leave their instagrams in the
description box as videos you can follow
the Estee Lauder girls but it was such a
pleasure to chat to them and got some
good feedback afterwards so hopefully
they really enjoyed it so yeah it's been
a great day I'm your wrap things up here
if you guys got to the end of this vlog
congratulations please leave and
lipstick emoji in the comments or
mention the word lipstick in your
comments and I will know who my best
viewers are and yeah give it a thumbs up
if you enjoyed it thumbs up if you'd
like more sporadic daily vlogs like this
because I know I mentioned potentially
doing weekly vlogs but yeah I tried that
and it kind of failed a little bit so
maybe I will try again but let me know

time you see me will be a travel vlog
for Antigua and maybe an outfit Diaries

lot of thumbs I've enjoyed this video
