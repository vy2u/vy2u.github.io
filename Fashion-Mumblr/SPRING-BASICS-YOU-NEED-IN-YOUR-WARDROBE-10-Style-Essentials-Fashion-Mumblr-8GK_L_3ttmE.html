joining me for today's video is going to
be all about the ten basic pieces that
you need in your wardrobe for spring so
I guess kind of your spring fashion
essentials the video is part of the
fashion month at spring edit which is
going on on my youtube channel this week
it's a whole series of videos all
celebrating the arrival of spring my
favorite season I've done this spring
edit for the past two years now just to
really inject loads of spring content to
my youtube channel we have got things
like whole videos we've got spring trend
videos spring beauty routines all of
that kind of fun stuff so if you like
the sound of that
and you love fashion videos and styling
videos then I'd love to have you back so
please hit the subscribe button it's
just down below and also turn the little
notification bell on so you don't miss
any of my upcoming videos the videos
that I have published already in the
2018 spring edit I'll leave linked down
below and then as and when the next
one's go up I will also leave them down
below so you can see all the videos as
part of the fashion of the spring edit
in the description box and I'll also
leave links to everything that I talked
about in today's video down there as
well so just click show more for all the
information that you will need so these
pieces that I'm going to be discussing
are the pieces that you will find
yourself reaching for day after day
after day there are the pieces that will
make your spring wardrobe just slot
together really really nicely I think
that if you have these 10 basics in your
wardrobe you'll find that it will be so
much easier to put outfits together
their pieces that work with so many
different things they're instant outfits
and they just make your whole wardrobe
just suddenly click together I honestly
would say that it's so worth investing
in these pieces because they are the
garments you'll wear time and time again
so getting that price per wear write
down so unsurprisingly quite a few of
these pieces are from I'd say the
premium end of the high street so not
quite Topshop level not quite like
designer level just somewhere in the
middle there are a few designer pieces
in here as well but then I'm also going
to be recommending high street
alternatives to so hopefully no matter
what your budget I have got some spring
wardrobe essentials that will work for
you so they kick things off with a white
blouse now white blouse obviously
is a very easy to style piece whether
you are wearing it for work or whether
it's for a smarter occasion a white
blouse can be styled in so many
different ways and I've got a few
favorites here I actually wanted to
share with you this particular one from
Rhys now I mentioned in a previous video
which was called what's new in my
wardrobe I mentioned that with my
investment pieces I reached with them
year after year after year and then I
said perhaps I would look through my
existing wardrobe and see which
investment pieces from previous years
I'm still wearing just to kind of prove
that I do really weddings year after
year especially when you're spending say
80 to 100 pounds on an investment piece
like a silk top and then when I was
showing you how I switched my wardrobe
up the spring I was really evaluating
those pieces and this for example is
something that I purchased from Rhys two
or three years ago and I still wear very
very regularly and it is most definitely
a spring wardrobe staple so this is you
just sort of back for you this is a
button-down blouse very very plain white
top doesn't really have any design
detail but it's just so beautifully made
beautifully crafted the fabric cuts is
just absolute perfection and the quality
of the material is really beautiful as
well so it is the kind of piece that has
stood the test of time in my wardrobe a
white blouse that I've picked up on a
high street this year is this one from
French Connection this has got a
beautiful bow detail on the neckline and
then it's got a little bit of a
detailing on the sleeves which just add
a little bit of interest to an otherwise
plain blouse it's got this kind of ice I
would say this is quite self-portrait
vibes the way that it's got the detail
on the sleeves you got frills you've got
some a PK you've got some kind of polka
dot material but this is a very very
versatile piece and as I mentioned so
many outfits can be completed with a
white blouse if you want something a
little bit more simple than once again
Rhys have got a fabulous option this one
is just basically a plain white silky
t-shirt but it's got little tiny pearls
on the hems of the t-shirt which just
add a lovely bit of interest to an
otherwise quite flaming top if you have
a really relaxed style so you want to
wear like a white t-shirt with jeans and
this is a great way of upgrading that
kind of look or alternatively you could
wear this with some of my other spring
basics such as midi skirts suede skirt
corduroy skirts high-waisted trousers so
many things can be pair
with a plane and whites t-shirts so
speaking of which my next spring basic
is a midi skirt now this I would say is
not necessarily applicable to everybody
I think that if you have very similar
style to me then you will find a midi
skirt to be a real essential piece in
your spring wardrobe hopefully if you're
here on my youtube channel then you
probably have quite similar style to me
and I would definitely say that a midi
skirt is an essential part of my spring
wardrobe I think that they work for so
many different occasions whether that's
a day at the office christening a
special event a garden party and also
they work really well when you're not
too short the dress code is because they
work for casual occasions and really
smart occasions and there are so many
ways to style them on chillier days and
this is probably my favorite one right
now this is the beautiful one from Reis
gorgeous knife pleat beautiful soft
overlay and then you've got a lining
underneath beautiful pink movie almost a
grey color so so practical goes with
everything in my wardrobe looks
fantastic paired down with a grey knit
or once again with my first basic a
white tee just such a beautiful very
very classic look I am more than happy
to invest in a MIDI scope from Reis
because I do know that it's kind of
thing that I reach for at least twice or
three times a week but perhaps if you've
not tried the midi skirt style before
you might want to look to more
affordable retailers I know that hmm
actually have some really gorgeous
options at the moment some that are not
too dissimilar to this so I'll try to
leave some affordable ones links down
below as well when it comes to
accessorizing in spring I honestly think
there's nothing better than a crossbody
bag this one from Topshop I've been
speaking about so so much it is so
on-trend with its circular design and it
fits so much stuff inside best part
though is that it was only 28 pounds but
it really is such an instant way to
uplift your wardrobe it really makes
such a huge statement whenever I post
about it on my Instagram everyone is
like oh my god the bag is so cool
so it really is a statement piece
because crossbody bags do make such a
statement and they're always a part of
your outfit that people spot quite early
on I think if it's is in your budget it
is nice to invest in a crossbody bag
some which have a slightly higher price
point that I wanted to share with you
include this one from Reis I absolutely
love this one it's one of my favorites
at the moment
is just absolutely divine it's a perfect
shape it's almost got kind of Chloe true
vibes but it was a fraction of the price
of Chloe handbags but it is a premium
high street piece so more expensive than
the Topshop but you can tell the leather
this is made from it's absolutely
beautiful the detailing the metal
stitching all of it is just such great
craftsmanship and then inside very very
spacious you've got a dust bag and then
just a little envelope pocket in there
too for me as soon as I put this on over
my coat I just feel like the whole
outfit is totally transformed and it's
such an eye-catching way to finish off
my outfit and then if you're looking for
a true investment piece of course a
designer crossbody bag is a fabulous way
of finishing the look this is one that
I've been reaching for a lot lately and
it is my YSL sunset bag this one's got a
really fabulous leather bit here so that
when it is worn crossbody it doesn't dig
in to your skin they're great if you're
wearing any Bardot tops you don't want
the chain digging until skin so it's
great that they thought about that this
one in particular and I did do a video
all about investing wisely in designer
bags is a really great investment piece
if you do cherish your designer bags and
want them to last a long time because
this faux kind of alligator that that is
a really long lasting and durable
leather so it's going to look its best
for a very very long time now I'd say
that for most people a pair of jeans is
a real basic core piece in your wardrobe
but for spring I would suggest a pair of
pastel colored jeans these are the
straight moto jeans from Topshop I find
Topshop denim is just a real go-to you
can't really go wrong the price points
of Topshop denim are absolutely amazing
and yet the quality never lets me down
these were 40 pounds they have got
plenty of stretch in them which makes
them super comfortable and then they've
also got a raw hem at the bottom which i
think is a really nice style detail
because of the color of these they're
very on trend for spring at pastels is
of course a huge spring trend if you
want to know more about spring trends I
did a whole video on my top 8 trends for
spring and how to wear them and also a
few key pieces I'll leave that linked on
the screen and down below but for those
days and you just want to be a little
bit more casual a pair of Paso jeans
isn't absolute must in your spring
wardrobe something that works with so
many spring outfits whether it's a
casual outfit such as a pair of jeans or
something a bit smarter such as your
midi skirt is a pair of white boots now
when I first got these I bought them as
a bit of an experiment I was like oh I
haven't had anything like that in my
wardrobe before but now I have them I
don't know how I lived without them I
warned them with so many different
outfits
especially the jeans mentioned and Scott
mentioned they're a fabulous way of
completing the look especially when the
temperatures aren't quite warm enough
for sandals you're not quite ready to
say goodbye to close toe shoes but you
want something a little bit lighter than
your trusty winter black ankle boots
this is a really nice way of
transitioning the Wardrobe from winter
to spring you still get the warmth of a
close to a boot but the lighter color
just makes it so much more appropriate
for spring and color palettes these ones
are from dune and I think that I do
Black Label so a little bit more premium
however I think that it's Kurt Geiger
very very similar per fraction of the
price I think about half the price so
I'll leave the dupes of the dune shoes
down below as well another spring basic
that I find myself reaching for year
after year is a lightweight knit this to
this day is still my absolute favorite
it's from Club Monaco you guys probably
were first seen this in my first
romantic lookbook which I published over
a year ago and I still just absolutely
adore it's probably one of my favorite
pieces in my wardrobe and it's one of
the pieces I really feel sums up my
personal style with the color the
ruffles and the sleeves it's just divine
and because it was from Club Monaco
which is obviously a bit more of a
premium high street retailer
it's just stood the test of time it's
such a fabulous quality piece so
investing in a lightweight knit is
something I would definitely recommend
for spring as I mentioned sadly that
piece is not available to buy anymore
but something that is available on the
high street that I love almost as much
is this jumper from Rhys this is a
really beautiful very very lightweight
pink committed jumper because it is so
lightweight it works with so many
outfits personally I think it also looks
great tucked into a midi skirt when the
temperatures are just a little bit
cooler you're not quite ready to wear
your silk t-shirt yet for then equally
with smart trousers you can layer this
with the lovely blouse and Denise oh
there's collar peeps through so many
different ways of styling - and I would
say a lightweight knit is definitely the
kind of piece you'll find yourself
reaching for many a times in your spring
wardrobe so certainly one that's worth
investing in my next spring essential is
a pair of mules I think that mules they
really started to come into fashion
probably this time last year and they're
just so easy to wear so practical so
comfortable although we are not ready to
say goodbye to that trend at all so I
have two pairs that I wanted to really
highlight in today's video this first
pair is actually my second pair of gold
Nikolas Kirkwood flats I had this exact
same pair of shoes last year wore them
to death they were most definitely the
most worn shoes in my wardrobe of 2017
and then finally they died a bit of a
debt at the end of last year when my
puppy Dickens decided to chew them but
because I wore them so much and full
designer shoes they're under 500 pounds
so not like ridiculous still expensive
but not you know some shoes are a lot
more expensive than that I thought the
price per wear of them was just
absolutely wonderful and they really did
elevate every outfit that I wore them
with so I decided to invest in a brand
new pair I now have this funky new pair
which I'm very much looking forward to
wearing but I also have this fabulous
pair from the high street which I'm
totally smitten with these are from
Topshop the pink color is just absolute
perfect they've got this little at
spherical gold heel which is absolutely
adorable and I love any kind of metallic
detail on shoes I think it's such a
gorgeous way to finish something off
they certainly look a lot more expensive
than their high street price tag these
were 62 pounds so not mega mega cheap
but I think for Topshop shoes you really
do know that you're getting very good
quality shoes and a very on-trend piece
as well so super excited to wear these
and I would definitely say that a pair
of mules is an essential in your spring
wardrobe that your wear time and time
again
my next spring essential is the
investment or statement coat now this
kind of depends on where you live but
here in the UK spring it can still be a
little bit chilly so we still have to
wear some outerwear I have two coats
here that I wanted to highlight both are
from Reese there's a bit of a trend
going on for recent pieces here but they
really are so beautifully made
I think they stand the test of time and
they're just so my style
both of these you'll have seen me
wearing is so much over on my Instagram
and in my blogs and everywhere basically
this is the pink one I wear it like a
cape sometimes or sometimes tie in at
the waist and insert a few photos on the
screen now of different ways I've styled
it but this is just such a beautiful
beautifully made well-crafted gorgeous
coat that it instantly makes my outfit
look so chic very professional very
polished very expensive and then this
one is a little bit more statement I was
IMing an hour
bit about buying this one but it again
instantly lifts an outfit so much makes
you look so on-trend makes you look like
you really know what you're doing you
feel fabulous when you're wearing X it's
such a statement so I'd say that a
statement or an investment coat like
this is a really great thing to invest
in in your spring wardrobe your
outerwear on your bag are what people
see within your outfits so it is worth
investing a little bit more in those
pieces as well as mules I would say that
sandals are a really good basic tab in
your spring wardrobe when those
temperatures do start to rise I don't
know about you but I cannot wait to get
my feet into sandals and this time of
year we start to think about our summer
holidays potentially picking up a few
pieces for upcoming trips so it's nice
to find a perfect pair of sandals they
also work with so many outfit
combinations whether that's a midi skirt
a little summary dress or trousers jeans
and I have found this most amazing pair
of sandals no they are not Valentino
although I have actually ordered the
band you know version because I love
them so much these were a fraction of
that price and they are from misguided I
think that chunky black heels like this
on a pair of sandals just really lifts
the look if you are petite like I am
then you will be very grateful for a
chunky heel and yet because it is such a
thick sturdy heel it means they're super
comfortable to wear all of these straps
as well it means your foot is not
slipping and sliding around so you will
be comfortable all day long but shoes
like this really do have the look of a
designer shoe but without that price tag
if sandals like this and not your thing
and then perhaps a pair of low strappy
sandals stores like accessorize next
they always have some really beautiful
sandal designs and thinking long term
having some gorgeous sandals in your
wardrobe will mean that you're ready for
summer when those temperatures do you
start to rise my final spring basic and
something that I reach for many many
times a week is pair of smart trousers
now I have a very very feminine style so
I'm often wearing skirts and dresses and
things like that but when I want to be a
little bit more smart or when I just
don't want to wear a skirt smart
trousers are something that I reach for
all the time this is probably my
favorite garment within this category
they are my blush colored Reese
strausser's these are super super
stretchy they are almost kind of legging
material because they are so stretchy I
think this color is very very flattering
rather be comfortable to wear and once
again you'll be so surprised with how
many things these go with if you've got
white colored boots if you've got a
white blouse there is your outfit apps
you sorted and because of how simple
they are they are a real classic and
basic piece in your spring wardrobe
however if you wanted to go for
something a little bit more on trend I
also have this pair of trousers from
River Island which you've probably seen
me styling in other videos with his
lovely ruffle and pearl detail these are
almost like a thicker tweed style
materials they do look very very smart
and once again the kind of piece that
can really be dressed up or dress down a
very versatile thing to have in your
wardrobe those ones I would say are kind
of legging like or cigarette style
charles's but another style of trousers
which is very very smart and very
versatile is wide leg palazzo trousers
this is a pair from coast and once again
a basic piece in your wardrobe because
it works with so many different
occasions if you can wear something like
this for work then there are very very
smart trouser can wear them with sandals
and Boots loads of different types of
footwear if you want to make them a
little bit more casual then reach for
your lightweight knits or if you want to
smarten the look you could go with a
silk camisole or an embellished top
there are just so many ways of styling a
smart pair of trousers so those are my
top 10 basics or essentials to have in
your spring wardrobe everyone's style is
different so I would love to know down
in the comments section below what you
would consider an essential part of your
spring wardrobe I'd absolutely love to
