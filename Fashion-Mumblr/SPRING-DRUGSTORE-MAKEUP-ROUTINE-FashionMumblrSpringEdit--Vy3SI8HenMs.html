for joining me for today's video which
is going to be a spring drugstore makeup
look business video number two from the
fashion mumbler bring edit I hope you
enjoyed yesterday's video if you missed
it I'll leave it links download in
description box and that video kicks off
my week of spring themed videos if you
don't miss any of them please make sure
you hit the subscribe button and that
way you'll be kept in the loop of all of
my upcoming spring content fashion
beauty chakki travel etc etc so today
I'm creating this glowing natural
springtime makeup look using a Lotus
product from at the drugstore which are
my absolute favorites at the moment I've
been creating this makeup look pretty
much every single day the past three
weeks or so and I adore these products
so much so I'm going to be using them a
lot more in the future if you want to
see how I created this look and keep on
watching and I hope you enjoy it so I'm
starting off with a clean complexion
already on my skin this morning I have
applied moisturizer and eye cream both
from the origins ginseng range and then
I also applied a Paula's Choice primer
so the first thing I'm now going to do
is foundation and there are actually
three drugstore foundations that I am
loving at the moment all three actually
selling new launches this one is
probably the best color match for me at
the moment so I'm a little bit darker
than usual thanks to the holiday this is
the Max Factor face tunity
Aldo shoulders three-in-one foundation
it's a primer concealer and foundation
so even if you don't want to prime your
skin first this one still has really
create lasting power I also adore these
two I just keep going back to Rivlin
bourgeois foundations and their newest
launches are just fabulous
both of them have anti fatigue
properties in them they really help to
freshen up the complexion I think today
I'm actually going to mix in some of the
new healthy mix from Bourjois with my
Max Factor face energy just to really
get the exact right consistency and
color for me and it starts as always by
putting a blob of each of the back of my
hand
mixing the two shades together and then
applying on the areas of my face and
then I maybe is a brush just to blend it
in nothing at different to my usual
makeup routine I do the same every
single day I do love my Beauty Blender
but I'm yet to find a drugstore and I
really really like so I'm just using
this Sephora brush for today's video you
also love this I feel like you get a
really buffed out finish with this kind
of brush really similar to the Real
Techniques buffing brush which I adore I
actually chopped my now focus is so
overused so I'm just using this one as a
replacement but drugstore brushes yeah
definitely Real Techniques buffing brush
you can see the lower half of my face is
really smoothed out and perfected really
like this combination of foundation and
both so affordable in fact I think I
like this as much as like my Giorgio
Armani luminous silk the finish is just
so glowy great for a spring makeup look
I get tons of questions about this
mirror as well
it's a ginormous mirror so handy having
a handbag and it's actually from Paul
and Joe and I will leave a link to it
down below if you're interested I think
it was like 16 pounds and it's probably
the best 16 pounds another sense every
time I use this combination I forget how
much I love it but yeah as you can see
my skin just looks fresh the anti
fatigue from the bourgeois has really
brightened my skin and the Max Factor
face milites given that really beautiful
coverage I still a definite caked in
makeup but the marks from a few of my
blemishes are totally covered
so absolutely loved his face so I don't
always do this next step but at the
moment I'm totally in love with these
Burt's Bees lip balms they're actually
more than lipstick because the color
palette is quite intense but personally
I just love to apply something
moisturizing on my lips after foundation
just that comfort factor this one is the
shade 502
suede blush and by my god it's my purse
shape and fill apply some of this so if
I wasn't leaving the house today or
perhaps I'm going for a no makeup day at
the school look or a work look this by
itself I think is gorgeous but I also
love to apply it so that comes
attractive also I find that my lipsticks
especially then more than that
consistency just go on even better when
I've got something like this on
underneath and now I'm going to tackle
my under eyes which actually not too bad
at the moment normally they're a little
bit darker but I'm going to put on some
real wake me up anti fatigue concealer
this is really brightening it's got
Fishman C and I just feel like it does
such a lovely job but without taking up
the skin under the eyes or a really cool
bright packaging as well this is
actually a new launch or relaunch and so
far I just love it once again the few
dots and then I'm using the warmth and
the softness of my fingertips just to
very gently Pat this and you don't want
to do any rubbing under the eye area and
so just keep it really light tapping
motions to blend it in to rescue makeup
I like to always take it into the corner
of my eye as well cuz that areas
sometimes get a little bit red and I
feel that that really freshens up the
eye area so if I keep looking over there
by the way I'm half doing my makeup in
the viewfinder by the way in my nail
varnish is also drugstore this is from
the Rimmel Kate Moss collection I just
think it's such a perfect nail varnish
especially if you've got a little bit of
a tan it's a beautiful coral pink color
I think it's in their super gel
collection and I just love that really
glossy finish that you get so yeah now
why she's also drugstore I've been
getting a few questions about my nails
recently so I thought I would just add
that one in there next we're going to
move on to brows I feel like when I do
my brows my make a really start to come
together so that's not going to do next
recently I have been using the Ilia
Fleur de force brow range this palette
is such a perfect color for me if you
have similar colorings to me and you
don't want your brows to be too dark
then definitely check
this palette you've got a couple of
different shades you can really build up
a very natural looking brow you can
really create a bit of depth with the
two different tones I'm going to take
the light shape start with and just fill
in my actual brows also using and I'm
your brush so starting at the bulb of
the brow this is exactly the same for
every single makeup tutorial I think
I've ever done filling in the gaps that
I have here and then spreading that
color through the brow now I'm going to
take the darker shade using the same
brush three lightly tap that and I'm
actually going to color underneath the
brow so I'm going to follow the brow
shape but this will help to really
define that shapes but it is still a
really soft and subtle way and now to
set the brows in place as well as adding
some little bit more color I'm going to
use also from the Fleur de force I'll
arrange this is the fix and Colour we've
got the clear end which is great if you
naturally have really good brows and
just want to smooth them down and or in
my case if you want a little bit more
color and more of a fix then you've got
this colored and once again I have got
the lightest shade and some good light
so really great precise small brush so
you can really be quite selective as to
how you shape the brows I'm just using a
really soft hand to almost add volume to
the brows by flicking it out and I'm
actually not going to lose the brow down
because I quite like this slightly
rough-and-ready
more natural brow look so that's all I'm
going to do as you can see it's really
not smoothed down instead of try to keep
it a little bit more voluminous I think
that's quite a nice natural look now you
might remember this palette from my
testing Primark Beauty juice video and
I've been using it a lot of a sense it's
a Primark classic contour kit I really
really like the bronze in this I
actually prefer it to a lot of other
drugstore bronzes so I'm going to start
by using the middle shade which is the
warmest of the three to really bronze
the face and use I'm sorry it's not
drugstore so much Charlotte Tilbury
bronzing brush and Real Techniques on a
fabulous one as well so just lightly
doing
and then start in the area of the
cheekbones this is really almost a color
test when I do it here it can allow me
to decide whether I need to add more or
less product because this area can be
quite dark and then I continue to shape
the face in the areas that the Sun would
naturally catch so along the hairline
down the news launches in the industry
blending out so very natural on the neck
the cheat one problem with having hair
this color is that your bronzer just
makes your entire hair line your orange
then taking a smaller Charlotte Tilbury
brush I'm going in with a more gray
shade personally I think on blonds and
fair skin types
grace console or a gray Brown is
something not pure brain is really
lovely for a very subtle contour
dyma says to admit that I'm not ready to
quit contouring but that's not too bad
for me I'm going to blur it out a little
bit using the bigger brush once again
going to keep it really nice and natural
and then I know that this banana shade
is meant for highlights but actually
really liked it as almost like a setting
powder it is incredibly matte so I just
use this is easily the fan brush just
swirling it from any areas that make it
a little bit shiny presence of high
marks as consistency is just really
really lovely adds a very soft eyeliner
part alright so that is my base complete
really happy with this so light and
fresh spring and all with affordable
products I didn't mention it before but
I will leave all links down in the
description box if you want to check any
of them at any further for my eyes I'm
going to start with an eye shadow and
this is a boutique from Sainsbury's
smokey eye chord I think it is so great
you can now be picking up your Coco Pops
and your milk and also get fantastic
makeup in the supermarket it's
incredible so this has got some really
beautiful colors you've got four
incredibly wearable Browns ranging from
a light one which is fabulous for in the
corners under the brow bone and then
some almost pinky tone Browns which are
really perfect for a soft smokey eye and
then more of a grey - which could be
quite good for the eyebrows but also
good for the crease so taking a zoeva
brush I'm going to start with this one
which is pinky beige eat Ram and applied
up all over the lid I think considering
the price and the fact that these are
Sainsbury's makeup I love the
consistency of these eyeshadows there is
no fall out the color payoff is gorgeous
and this shade itself actually reminds
me I'll born from a benefit palette but
then if you know the Sun kind of
gorgeous women get called but I just
absolutely love it
if you like kinky brands like me then
definitely
power out so I've taken it just above
the crease and then I'm blending it out
there's no harsh line and they're not
going to go in with the darker this is
very subtly shimmery not sparkly but it
is still a really beautiful glow to it
and I'm just focusing that on the actual
crease of the brow I love the brow so
I'm taking it from about a third of the
way into my crease all the way out to
the outer corner is using that
semicircle movement to really add a
little bit of depth the eye area but
what I am going to do is use my Kiko
lettuce better long lasting stick
eyeshadow and teaches this in a full
Kiko makeup lip video last week and I
just absolutely loved it I'm going to
use this along the lash line and because
I'm not going to going in with any
eyeliner just adds a little bit more
definition to the eyes without the
harshness of an eyeliner and because it
is cream it means it's it's super smooth
to apply really quick and easy very
blendable and yeah this has become a
firm favorite of mine so far so just
carefully drawing it in really
feathering motion along that lash line
and then also just tracing the bottom
lashes as well basically applying this
where I would apply an eyeliner but I
think for spring it's very nice to have
more of a glow to the eyes instead of a
really harsh eyeliner and the fact that
this got a little bit of a glow to it
but it's not
again it's not sparkly it just really
makes the eye area look beautifully
awake and fresh which let's take that we
all need so gorgeous bio cameras picking
this up especially along the lower lash
line and then on the lashes I'm using my
Primark rose gold eyelash curlers to
curl the lashes if you guys are
interested in Primark beauty I did a
whole video on some of my favorite bit
so I leave that link on-screen I can
figure out how but if not I'll be down
in the description box and then - - Cara
you've probably heard me talking about
this before I'm such a big fan of this
L'Oreal mascara I'm reaching for it over
mine
I render one every single day it is my
everyday mascara that double-ended it
the full flash NuStar x fiber and the
first end is just kind of like a normal
mascara but really good at separating
out the lashes and the second side
actually has the fibers in it so if your
lashes are a little bit sparse or you
want real serious like false lash
volumes but without false lashes this as
exactly what you need I'm going to start
the course weird side number one because
it's not something you can also apply it
to your bottom lashes normally for a
very soft natural makeup look I don't
really touch the bottom lashes but I
just really like how this delicately
adds a little bit of color especially if
you're blonde like Mead and chances are
your bottom lashes don't even show up so
this is really nice to add a very subtle
soft definition see even without adding
a fiber I think it's a great mascara but
wait until you see what happens when I
add the second layer so first layer is
complete I don't really give it too much
time to dry normally when I'm putting my
makeup on I'm in a good for us but at
all times leave it as that so I'm going
in straight away with the second part
and immediately it has volume in my
lashes with these tiny little fibers
which act as entirely new eyelashes
I think you've started in Korea as most
beauty trends do and it's pleasing quite
a while for the UK high street to really
start to use fibers but I think now that
I've been using this mascara for so long
I really do not want to go back through
a non fiber mascara
I just love you get that full flush
effect but to a level of your choice so
I'm going to stop here that you really
could just keep on adding more and more
fibers until you get such a kind of
zombie fluttery lashes Beck I just think
it's absolutely gorgeous especially for
an everyday look where you don't want to
have an incredibly dark dramatic lash
you still want to have something very
feminine very flirty and yeah just love
it so big fan of the samskara
and I would hackneyed pay about full
time surprise for this but such good
value from the drugstore so next we're
moving
back to the lips I already have my farm
on which means my lips are incredibly
comfortable soft and ready for some
lipstick there are so many gorgeous lip
products on the high street at the
moment in the drugstore and I love ah so
so many it's really really hard to
choose for this video I'm going to start
I mean this is my kind of everyday looks
of course I'm going for a pinky brown
shade the lip liner that I adore at the
moment is this one from collection it is
number one nude pink lip definer and
lasting color and it does what it says
on the tin it defines the lips and it is
a long-lasting color and it's a scroller
which is amazing that means you don't
need to sharpen it mine actually keeps
breaking so if I fit it up then it will
fall out but never mind and so I'm going
to start wedded lining the upper and
lower lips with this crown to be honest
I love this color so much I could
happily just wear this on my lips I
should be very happy filling in my
entire lips with this color also the
color payoff is fabulous I hate it with
certain even higher-end lip liners we
have to kind of scratch it onto your
lips right this is so soft and the color
payoff is absolutely instantaneous color
wise it's so perfect it's very similar
to my natural lip color and but better
it reminds me of Charlotte Tilbury
pillow-talk so huge huge fan of this I
will continue three purchases for long
as I live I think I'm in a little out
there
after you love it and then I have three
products I am so sorry I could not
choose I think it's going to be cases
eenie meenie miney moe I love all three
of these so much at the moment
first of all the Revlon Ultra AV AV HD
matte lip color I mean the shade of this
is just heavenly really like how this
one applies as well you've got this doe
foot applicator so quick and easy to
apply and the consistency is beautiful
then a very similar shade this is the
Max Factor madness in Oh 5 nude this is
more of a lipsticks formula it's one of
those new formulations very Barney but
but still incredible color payoff if I
pop a little bit on the back of my
and you can see it's beautiful soft pink
shade love this for an everyday makeup
it's quite hassle like very feminine
just beautiful the spring and then the
most farm use for three this is the
Rimmel moisture Trini lipstick in 100
new shock so this one is probably the
most sheer it's very great barmy great
for like a midday top-up just a most
gorgeous like petal pink again color so
stunning I think what I'm going to do is
start off with the Revlon I have applied
a new Revlon's my face yet and then
maybe add one of the others and top
actually I think I'm just going to leave
this one kind of it's so much so as you
can see the consistency is incredibly
comfortable considering that it's like
ascending that you've still got a little
bit of a glow to it so it's not that
really kind of dehydrated lip effect and
I describe this consistency as I could
still keep kind of Kashmir I just loved
it
color wise I adore it's moving a little
bit more pink away from the brown which
I have been wearing a lot of recently I
think it's so flattering so natural but
still looks like you've made an effort
if you do have a beautiful color on your
lips so the last thing to do is a little
bit of blush I'm going to be using my
Kiko less is better in palatable Rose
cream blush once again I use this in my
Kiko tutorial a couple of days ago and
the formula the color of this I just
adore up and using every single day
since I got it I actually left my blush
brush upstairs I'm going to apply it
with my foundation brush and so that's
the thing with cream it's just so easy
to apply arrangements matter what you
apply it with well I would recommend the
blusher brush Real Techniques again I've
got a fabulous one so just putting this
on the apples of my cheeks and blending
it upwards I'll also leave my Kiko video
links down below because all the
products in this less less is better
range are just fabulous I truly adore
them so much but this and the eyeshadow
stick cutting getting so much use out of
and that is my finished everyday
drugstore spring makeup look this is
kind of look that I literally wear day
in day out I'm very boring and
critically done so my makeup I really
don't also too much from this finished
look I alter the products and when I'm
going for a drugstore look the products
that I mentioned in the video are my
absolute go twos at the moment I really
