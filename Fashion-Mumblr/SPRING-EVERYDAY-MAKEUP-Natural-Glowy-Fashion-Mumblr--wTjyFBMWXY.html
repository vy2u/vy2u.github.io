I would do a very chatty everyday spring
makeup routine and then it's gonna kind
of merge into a bit of a vlog as you
might be able to tell I'm filming us on
my vlogging camera so very very chilled
set up I thought it had been a while
since I'd done an everyday makeup
routine since I didn't do one as
promised during my spring headaches I
wasn't feeling too good and I have
switched up my makeup quite a lot
recently as we finally move into spring
times that's what's going to be going on
today and first of all I've already
prepped my skin I've used the herbivore
pink cloud rose water moisture creme and
this is a brand that is fairly new to
the UK it's available in Space NK I went
to that press day a couple of weeks ago
met the founders and just loved
everything that the brand stood for this
is a favorite product of mine it's
really lightweight smells good it's very
natural and yeah perhaps my skin
absolutely perfectly so that is what is
on my skin right now most of my makeup
at the moment is in this bag because we
are traveling quite a lot at the moment
so I tend to just chuck everything that
I'm using regularly in here and by the
way I've not even kind of planned what
I'm going to show you this is just gonna
be whatever I find
pop it on my face so I've been using the
I love paradise self-tanning drops quite
a lot just to keep my skin on my face
quite brown because otherwise my body
goes Brown at my face doesn't so that's
that's been being used a lot I'm gonna
grab a pair of sunglasses to keep my
hair back there's a bit of a temporary
temporary headband and then I'm going to
start with oh and by the way quick face
update so I have tinted my own eyebrows
using the Ilia die brow kit and I also
have individual lash lash extensions
from a place called lash perfection Soho
and I really like how they look it just
means that I can be a little bit more
makeup free on holiday I'm going to use
the bourgeois anti-fatigue healthy mix
foundation to start with this is a
really nice one for this time of year
just keeps the skin looking really fresh
and it is anti fatigue it's got a
vitamin complex in there and I find it
blends out really easily last a long
time and the color that I have is a
really good shade match it
number fifty-four and I do kind of mix
this with other things as I get more
Brown but at the moment this is
absolutely perfect and I'm applying it
with my it cosmetics brush just move the
camera alphabet hopefully that makes a
bit more sense and if I'm looking up
that's because I'm using the viewfinder
as my mirror for today and then also
that big mirror behind where you guys
aren't I'm gonna use my trusty handheld
mirror to be a little bit more precise I
get a lot of questions about this mirror
when you guys see it I will leave it
links down below along with everything
that I'm using in this video but it is
Paul and Joe and I got it from a sloth
deke okay next is concealer and I've
also just realized you can see my MMS in
the mirror reflection that's because
today is actually a big packing and
unpacking day so a lot of stuff is going
on down here I thought it was out of
view but you can definitely see little
glimpses of it so forgive me for my mess
next I'm doing concealer and this is the
Laura Mercier flawless fusion ultra long
wear concealer and it does what it says
on the tin it flawlessly fuses with your
skin and the rest of your makeup lasts a
really long time doesn't crease
basically everything that I like in a
concealer so I just dab that on with the
doe foot applicator and then I'm gonna
blend it in with my fingers with my
under eye concealer I use a shade two or
three shades lighter than my skin and oh
my gosh I totally forgot to show you my
new favorite step in my skincare routine
oh that's so annoying okay I will tell
you when I have blended my concealer how
much I am now in love with Jade rolling
so I'm just finishing blending the
concealer in with a Beauty Blender and I
just find that this helps with the
fusion or the concealer on my skin so
great - happy with that now so I also
got this at the herbivore press event
and it is a j-roller so it's got a
larger crystal duke crystal stone on one
side and then a smaller one on the other
side now I've been doing this for about
10 days and already it's my favorite
palettes of my morning skincare routine
some people say that you can leave them
in the fridge personally our house is
not that warm and I don't find that it
needs to go in the fridge the stone
itself is quite cooling and I really
wish I had shown you this before doing
my foundation but basically what I do to
de-puff
the skin in the morning is just roll I
spend about two minutes it's quite a
mindful thing to do just let your
thoughts go elsewhere while you roll the
skin and I do maybe one two three one
two three much slower and then just keep
going around my face in an upwards
motion with a larger roller it helps
with the lymphatic drainage so the skin
is a lot more supple more elastic helps
to keep everything moving helps with
collagen production but the thing that I
find it the best for is under-eye
puffiness when I wake up in the morning
if you go to my vlog a couple of weeks
ago I literally look like a meerkat in
the mornings because my eyes are so
puffy but what I have been finding
recently using a smaller side just very
carefully not only is it cooling but
also just helps everything move around
the smaller side of the Jade roller just
makes so much difference with my face
puffiness in the morning it has a
stronger effect than coffee for making
me look awake that is for sure now I
have a little bit of foundation on it
and also if you're into your ancient
Chinese medicine jade is a stone or a
crystal that helps to ward off bad
spirits and negative energy so all-round
an amazing thing to do and despite its
kind of heaviness this is definitely
coming with me in my travel makeup bag
so yeah you've probably seen me rambling
about it on instagram stories but had to
mention that in today's video at this
stage I always like to put some balm on
the lips I find that foundation can kind
of dry out my lips a little bit and I
use the Clinique pet start pout
perfecting balm because I feel like this
is the best one for preparing my lips
for lipstick later on and then I'm going
to powder my skin and I don't like a
really matte look I like to always be
quite glowy so I'm going to be using the
Laura Mercier candle glow shear
perfecting powder I have the shade 3
I've got a few different powders that I
like I love the bare minerals bare Pro
and I love the lemare powder I love the
laura mercier loose powder but this is
the one that is in my travel makeup bag
so it's the one I've been using at the
most recently and as you can see it's
not getting rid of the glow at all but
because it's a powder just helps my base
to last a lot longer look good for
longer and still have a nice luminous
complexion which is what I love during
the springtime I make sure to focus on
the areas on my makeup does tend to run
away so on the chin and the eyes and
then also between my eyebrows I tend to
get quite shiny then I'm going to use
some bronzer this is the girl and
terracotta light bronzer for some crisp
sunkissed healthy glow and again perfect
for traveling because it is so slim this
is an absolutely beautiful bronzer look
at that packaging and that product
presentation it's got a bit of pink in
there as well so I think it's just a
really lovely natural color current
favorite favorite bronzing brush is the
bare minerals seamless shape and finish
brush so as always I start on the
cheekbones which is to hopefully give
myself a little bit of contour and
definition and then I go around the
edges of my hairline and just the rest
of my face where the Sun would naturally
bronze my skin there little the pink
sections and the blush also give a tiny
bit of a shimmer as well so it does act
again to keep the skin looking nice and
glowy so as I said I have had my brows
shaped quite recently and DIY tinted so
this is going to be a very quick brow
routine I'm using a brush with a spoolie
just to brush them into place so I can
see more clearly what I'm working with
then I'm taking my Dior
brow pencil in the shade double-o one
because this is the lightest one and I
don't want anything too dark in my
already very dark before my hair color
at brows I may have left the diamond a
little bit too long and this one I
really like because it's like a little
pencil so you can be really precise I
don't like my brows to be too defined
she says that the world's darkest
eyebrows so I just kind of add to any
little gaps and make the tail of my
brows a bit longer because they do tend
to fizzle out towards the ends then I'm
just using the arch brow volumizing
fiber gel from our glass and this will
help to kind of set them in place and
add a little more volume as well because
this does actually have brow fibers and
my brows are a little bit sparse so that
extra volume is very much appreciated
all right so I'm going to do my
eyeshadow next and I have a few products
so I've been using a lot while traveling
these are all super easy
I call them steelo's first of all this
one from Laura Mercier which is a copper
shade I'll show you a little close-up
there and I find that these are just so
nice for wearing on the beach you can
just kind of one slick blend it in and
you're done this one is a little bit
more almost grey in color it is from
Dior and this one is especially great
for holidays because it's actually
waterproof so this one is going to be
particularly good on our next trip which
is to the Maldives and then in the
evenings this one from the poppy Selfish
range from Estee Lauder with in
collaboration with Violette it's a
little bit darker I use this one in the
evenings and then also just underneath
my or around my lashline because it's a
really good way of defining the eyes if
you don't really like eyeliner which
they don't but for today I'm going to be
using my new exaggerated palette from
Charlotte Tilbury this is a new launch
and it is such a beautiful eyeshadow
palette look at those colors I just
think they are the most perfect colors
for people like me that don't like to go
too crazy like a natural look with a
really lovely soft look I'm gonna start
with the matte shade this one in the
bottom corner it's just a very very
wearable almost mushroomy brown color
quite warm as well also good for spring
I'm gonna pop that all over the lid
taking a different brush just to totally
blend that out and keep it looking
really natural and then back with my
smaller brush I'm going with this really
light shimmering brown shade and I'm
just gonna put that on the lid itself no
higher than the lid
and that just adds a really lovely
eye-catching shimmer but it's not too
in-your-face so it's still real works
really nicely for an everyday look
literally the world's easiest I makeup
so because of my lash extensions I'm not
wearing masks are at the moment but when
I do need to add mascara I have this
Dior this is the Dior show pump and
volume waterproof mascara because of our
travels obviously waterproof mascara
isn't essential and the Dior show is
just great for separating and volumizing
the lashes you've got a great stiff
bristled brush there so really nice for
separating the lashes moving back to the
complexion and keeping with the spring
glowy theme I'm using the benefit gold
rush blusher this one has got a little
bit of gold in there so it's a nice kind
of highlighting blush I really don't
know why they bother putting a mirror in
the lid because you cannot see anything
out of that but I just absolutely love
the color of this when it really fresh
the spring and once again a little bit
of highlight in there and some well okay
so next I'm just going to use a faithful
i'p to get rid of the lip balm and all
the foundation or my lips so lip wise
again on my travels have been using a
few different products the deal addict
lip tattoo long wear color tint has been
a real favorite especially on the beach
because it is a tendency just pop it on
a beautiful coral color lasts all day
and then this is the sugar punch tinted
lip treatment SPF 15 so for obvious
reasons that is amazing well on the go
but as I'm not on the go at the moment
I'm going to do something different I
say different from my holiday routine
not different for me I'm going to start
off by lining the lips with the
bourgeois funky Brown contour edition
that lip liner looks like this lovely
natural brown shade
so you can see that's just helped to
define my lips and this is really
affordable and a perfect color I prefer
it to lots of my high-end lip liners and
then I'm gonna delve into my handbag
makeup bag to choose my lipstick because
this is where the lipsticks that I wear
on a daily basis usually end up of
course still my favorite is my Tom Ford
sable smoke or is it warm sable warm
sable this gorgeous dreamy brownie nude
shade which is my usual go-to but I
think I'm gonna try something a bit more
a bit more barmy
actually keeping it high street I'm
going to use the L'Oreal color e shine
in 642 this is what the packaging looks
like and then it is basically a dupe of
the gallon by Terry and Shante Kyle at
Barnes which I am obsessed with this is
an amazing high street alternative so
then I applied this amazing color it's
such a lovely kind of natural pink and
it's very comfortable because it's so
barmy looks as though you've got kind of
a gloss on as well big big fan of that
so that's going straight back in and my
handbag and makeup bag and I'm going to
finish with a mist this is the Eve LOM
radiance face mist energizing
high-powered moisture mist with
hydration boosting actives and
antioxidants protects skin from
atmospheric exposure and gives a healthy
looking complexion I absolutely love
this and find it super refreshing
probably far more than you need but I
just absolutely love it
that's my everyday spring makeup look I
just realized the birds been tweeting
away in the background this whole time
how lovely how seasonal I'm gonna do a
little bit of packing now and I'll catch
up with you guys a little bit later ok
so this is the current state of my
bedroom that's where I was just sitting
but now it is a pile of clothes to
either be packed or to film with because
actually it's fairly bright outside so I
think I'm going to quickly film my
what's new in my wardrobe because then I
can just point you guys in the direction
of this video if you want to know where
the things are from that I'm wearing on
our holidays so I'm going to do that now
I've also just been to doddle and picked
up an asus order so I thought I would
show you what I have got from here most
of its holiday stuff so let's have a
little look inside can I do it
one-handed yes is the answer oh yeah I
forgot
I ordered a neck pillow because I always
find it a bit gross that I have just
like a really old one at the moment but
it's covered in makeup whereas this one
I think is from bando has a little zippy
cover so I can actually take the cover
off and wash it between holidays and
this trip this first write that we're
going on is actually a day flight but I
do still fall asleep on most flights and
it is 10 hours so that's wonderful all
the way outside we got Oh snacks simple
accessory oh I thought it was snacks is
it eat nature who knows I've got a hat
which actually I think it looked a bit
better on the website but it's quite
like rough around the edges a bit of a
raw hemmed hat I do have under that pile
a couple of other hats so maybe I'll see
which one I prefer but I do like the
color of this one let me know down below
what you guys think
then I've got oh this is amazing so this
is a bikini from new look but I thought
it looked so much like that Instagram
brand la rivesh that is also on net a
porter i actually was very kindly sent
one of the Larrabee Schwan's survived
post about it yet I'll put a picture on
the screen if not I'll just do an
Instagram photo from their accounts but
yeah the Larrabee Sh ones I think are
around 200 pounds which is bonkers and
this is new look so probably more like
10 pounds so definitely going to take
that to the next trip with me couldn't
go on holiday without a straw bag so
grabbed this one I think the brand is
Miss Selfridge oh no this one is South
Beach but I thought it's a really good
size it's very basic but exactly what
you need for a beach holiday okay so
these are the bottoms of the bikini top
I showed you earlier they've got little
floral details on
side and then a very skinny band which
is nice because it means you'll get a
very nice tan line or lack of the bottom
is so big though I prefer that little
skinny almost thumb like and I don't
know why everyone insist on putting so
much fabric everywhere but yeah that'll
be beautiful then I have this pair of
jeans eres us own brand
they've got lace at the bottom oops
clothing avalanche which I think could
look really really cool in fact I'm
gonna give these a try on in a second so
I'll show you how they look but I really
like the wash they're very kind of
relaxed relaxed style so I'll give those
a try in a sec then I have this jumpsuit
I think it's from a brand called Moon
River I think no it's warehouse maybe I
didn't get anything from Moon River but
yep again I thought that'd be really
nice beachy outfit the kind of thing you
can just fling on super easy peasy it's
a full-on dress I don't know if it's a
dress or a jumpsuit and then it's got
little pom-poms and I love pom pom
details love off-the-shoulder details
that's a big tick and then there's last
thing that sorry such a mess
is a dress from for love and lemons and
it's a brand that I wanted to try out
for a long time it's not that accessible
here in the UK this was one of the only
things I could find on ASOS but I've
heard really good things about the brand
for them on Instagram for quite a while
so it's a dress and it is this sheer
overlay with the floral embroidery on it
and then it came with a little slip
underneath now I must say this was very
expensive I think it was I think it was
well over 100 pounds if not like
approaching 200 and it doesn't appear to
be like the highest of quality but then
again I guess it's got lots of
embroidery made in China that's probably
cause I'm about three pounds to make but
yeah we'll see I'm gonna do a little bit
of a little bit of research see how good
this looks
that's my a sauce hole by the way it is
about two hours since I filmed the
makeup clip as you can see my skin has
already starting to like glow through
maybe I need a topic of the powder on
line between the brows that's the area
that tends to get a little bit shiny but
the rest of the makeup is looking really
really good
I actually brushed my teeth because I
had a big coffee after filling the
makeups
did my makeup had another coffee and
then brush my teeth so I took off the
lipstick that I had on before and I'm
gonna film a video in a second so I'm
gonna put on a matte lipstick and before
I do matte lipsticks I like to try and
prepare my lips as much as possible so I
slathered on these super skin.that lip
balm from this aisle this one here and
if you saw my I think you actually might
cold-weather beauty essentials video
from quite a while ago
then I included it in that and it is my
favorite like really nourishing lip balm
so now while it's still fairly bright
outside I think I'm gonna film be what's
new in my wardrobe video so stay tuned
I'll be back with you in half an hour
she says optimistically after filming I
must apologize for all of this mess but
I'm gonna put on this lovely Bobbi Brown
lipstick and love the packaging of this
it's just in this gorgeous gold tube and
then this lipstick I feel is perfect for
spring absolutely beautiful I only used
a couple of times so far so let's just
pop some of this on that is literally my
perfect like pretty pink shade and it's
still nice and balmy I said I was gonna
go from matte lipstick but that is
perfect and I'm gonna mattify my skin do
you know what I'm gonna try something
new I'm gonna try the Givenchy prism
Libre it is the most beautifully
packaged product look at this packaging
it's got like a leather black leather
lid and this gorgeous floral design not
tried it yet
so I'm gonna put some of that on my
t-zone so it comes out in these four
different colors which are good for
color correcting or I'm just going to
blend them all into one and then you get
this little powder puff which actually
I'm not going to use I'm going to use
this brush and I've just popped some of
the powder in the lid these are my notes
by the way I like to make notes on
videos I'm about to film so this is my
notes for the video you will have seen
nann Sunday last week how to make High
Street look high-end anyway I digress
so tap off the excess and then apply to
areas of shine of which I have many I'm
pleased to say it's not taking up or
making my skin look really matte and
chalky seems to still show the glow
thumbs up from me I'm Vicki just taking
a bit of a road trip to Charlie's mom
and dad's house for Sunday lunch and now
we're just gonna go and visit some
friends who live nearby I will catch up
with you a bit later and show you my pre
holiday beauty routine my pampering
evening routine what pre-flight pamper
routine masks I think I've got those
glam glow on to attack why would you
like oxygenating cleansing ones sounds
good very good well I'm good okay so
sorry for the slightly scary appearance
I've just got out of the shower I'm
covered in fake tan on my body I'm
wearing Charlie's mum's pajamas because
they are nice and long sleeve long
legged so not are we getting any fig
down the sheets and then I have put the
origins glow commits mask the Madeline
Shaw coconut face mask on and it's a
lovely hydrating mask so I'm just going
to leave this to absorb overnight
