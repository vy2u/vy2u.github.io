be what I've been wearing lately I'm
going to show you a few of the outfits
which I've been wearing on repeat
throughout the past few weeks I guess
you could say these have been my spring
everyday outfits so these the ones I've
been wearing for events for meetings
things like that and they have just
become my go-to outfits let's start off
with outfit number one and this one
started with the silk camisole this
lovely silk vest top a beautiful color
beautiful material this is from Reese
Reese's a retailer that I go to for a
lot of my basics I find the quality is
absolutely fabulous the designs are so
classic they are a little more on the
pricey side as top was just under 100
pounds but I have been wearing it so
much I'm already getting the price per
wear write down the color as you can
imagine it goes with so many things in
my wardrobe and I really like this open
neckline is great for this time of year
if you've got a bit of a tan or if
you're trying to catch a bit of a turn I
think it's just super super flattering I
paired it with these beautiful very very
light pink allots these are extremely
affordable from ASOS and yet I love how
they're cuts I think with the high
waisted style of these again it's very
flattering they've got some delicate
pleats in there which is a beautiful
design detail that you don't often see
at this price point and I think the
length is also very flattering my
Nicholas cup would flat shoes are the
perfect color match for this beautiful
silk camisole so I instantly grabbed
those on putting the slip together and
then my newest accessory is actually
these sunglasses which are so fun they
add a little bit of joy and excitement
to this outfit these are Kate Spade and
I really like the flower embellishments
on them my jewelry is mostly from
Pandora I am wearing this beautiful
Pandora heart I think it's called the
hearts of Pandora necklace also matching
earrings and also Pandora bracelets and
then when it gets a little bit chilly
I've been adding this coat you'll see
this coat in a few outfits within this
video
it's another really lovely affordable
piece under 100 pounds from a Topshop
and
it's a like a faux leather so it's not
real leather but it hangs absolutely
beautifully I think it's a really great
way to complete the look make sure you
stay nice and warm on those chilly
spring mornings and I think the neutral
color of this is just so so wearable and
it makes your outfit look very expensive
it's almost like an update of a trench
coat it's got those very classic
features and yet this faux leather
material makes a real statement then
I've got my Prada bag a little luxe
touch to this outfit this was actually
fairly affordable when it comes to Prada
bags inside I've got my essentials
including my current favorite lipstick
this is one of the L'Oreal color riche
and I love the color and it's super
barmy as well okay we're moving on to
outfit number two and color palette wise
it is very very similar I've gone for
some white key lots these are actually
from River Island and they've got a
beautiful lace detail down at the bottom
there you can see I've also got the
Topshop faux leather coat on again
and another pink top this one is from
Club Monaco you'll see this and a little
bit more detail shortly the shoes are
actually dupes for Valentino sandals
these were incredibly affordable I think
they were around 32 pounds if not even
less this is a nice clip to show you the
detail at the bottom of the trousers as
well and these are a great hit at the
Chelsea Flower Show so many people were
asking me about them the bag is from
Kate Spade you may remember this I got
this in New York in November I really
loved it thought it was a nice finishing
touch of this outfit and again Pandora
bracelets and my Kate Spade sunglasses
to completely look here you can see the
ruffle detail on the shoulders at the
top it is so so lovely reminds me of my
jumper that I got from Club Monaco a
couple of years ago which is still one
of my favorite pieces in my entire
wardrobe my watch is Omega this is a new
one again and absolutely love it I find
the gray of the watch and the grab the
handbag go really really nicely together
I only have a few clips of this outfit
we were very brief with our shooting but
this is a dreamy dress from Kate Spade
the bag is also Kate Spade I just love
it and I love things like this that make
a real statement but you don't need to
think about what you're going to wear
that day because the dress does all the
talking all you have to think is what
shoes you're gonna pop on it's an
instant outfit and I love the material I
love the pattern so naturally I wore
this for a little shopping trip into
Kate Spade on Regent Street so yeah I
absolutely love this one and cannot wait
to wear it even more finally outfit
number four and this one was very
popular when I posted on my Instagram
I'm wearing a pair of silk I think the
silk Rhys shorts high waisted and I
really wanted to try out a few different
ways of wearing this silky shirt dress
it's just the most beautiful long design
I prefer it as a top then a dress
actually it's got a bow tie at the waist
beautiful pleated material and the
sleeves I've had it with my Monica
vanity bangle and then this is again a
Monica vinegar and Pandora collection on
my wrist Santa Monica vanity necklace
also an astronomic one in there my
engagement ring looking beautiful
another pair of Kate Spade sunglasses to
complete the look here you can see my
mulberry Seton bag and then my Valentino
sandals so I've got the Valentino's and
I've got the misguided tubes
I wear them both absolutely loads that
is it for today's video I really hope
