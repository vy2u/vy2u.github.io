could potentially be the world's most
casual chatty Zahra Hall so I'm filming
this video as you can probably tell in a
very different setup downstairs in my
living room because it is 5:00 p.m. on a
Tuesday this is the only place in the
house that has any kind of natural light
right now so I thought I would just
quickly show you what I picked up from
Zara today I had one of those days where
I was just here there and everywhere but
somehow amongst it all managed to dash
into Zara the one in cotton garden which
I find is a really good one it always
has like a really good selection of
products and I don't think I have ever
been so thrilled with the pieces that I
have picked up as I have with this haul
this is like the most me selection of
products ever I think if you guys are
familiar with my style
then you will agree that all of these
pieces absolutely hit the nail on the
head when it comes to my style so I have
I think 8 to 10 pieces in total all of
them are just going to be absolute
perfect for summer and I did try on a
couple of extra pieces which I didn't
buy so I will also show you the Tryon
clips for those because they are amazing
but they just want weren't quite right
for me so yeah I'm just gonna get
straight stuck into it I'm hoping but
I'm not really gonna have to edit this
video I'm hopefully just gonna film it
all in one go because I don't know why I
just feel like I'm so bogged down with
things on my to-do list at the moment
video editing it usually takes like 2
hours so I'm hoping that this one is
just going to be a smooth run so let's
try and do this as smoothly as possible
the first thing that I bought was this
beautiful skirt now I did try all of
these honestly I know that all of these
look absolutely beautiful and also for
the Tryon Clips
the lighting is not going to be the best
but I'm going to show you the trial
clips that I filmed in the fitting rooms
from earlier today so very much a kind
of live try on haul so this is a skirt
from the Zara basic collection I got
these size extra small this was 49
pounds and it is this broderie anglaise
lace style at skirt it's got a beautiful
almost like a very subtly scalloped
bottom and you can see it's got the
broderie anglaise flowers its fits like
around middle of
waste so it's quite a flattering way in
that it pinches in the waste very
feminine silhouette so just totally
totally my style I can imagine myself
standing this with I was wearing a pink
strappy top earlier today that looked
absolutely gorgeous with this I have a
few tops that are fairly kind of wide on
straps I think white would look really
nice of course but any other pastel
colors like a mint green would look
super nice with this I would say was
still technically in spring but this
almost definitely work for some as well
even going into autumn you could pair
this with a nice chunky knit so 50
pounds not super super affordable
especially considering its era basic but
it is so gorgeous and so my style that I
had to pick that up I also find midi
dresses or midi skirts rather work for
so many different things if you have an
office job you could wear that with a
beautiful blouse if you have a slightly
more casual job you could wear that with
a t-shirt there are just so many
occasions you can wear a skirt like that
too and I feel like it can be dressed up
or down I went for lunch with a brand
today and we went to a really lovely
restaurant in Mayfair called Isabel's
and you kind of have to dress up to go
in there and I feel like that would have
worked for mine more casual meetings in
the morning and also very smart lunch so
very very versatile I totally can just
talk to myself into this even though I
already have it the next thing is also
lace also kind of proud to be on grey
pretty much the same fabric they've
definitely used the same reel of fabric
I'm gonna tip this one up again this is
a dress and once again they're just a
very very me piece if you find that you
have the same style as me then no doubt
you will absolutely love this as well
once again quite feminine in the
silhouette pinches in at the waist
it has this ladder detail on it you can
see what I mean here this ladder detail
which i think is very synonymous with
more expensive brands like Zimmerman so
it has this kind of vibes about it there
is a ruffle detail down there a v-neck
waist a zipper that goes all the way up
to the back and then it is that very
ladylike kind of three-quarter MIDI
length as well so very versatile as well
this one was 69 pounds so you get a lot
more clothing for your money constraints
only
what 20 pounds more expensive down at
the skirt but this is the kind of thing
that is just amazing time in your
wardrobe because I say I feel like I say
this for so many summer dresses but you
literally don't need to think about your
wardrobe if you have something like this
in your wardrobe then you can just open
it up on a warm summer's day or a spring
day pop this on and you will look
fabulous so big fan all right these next
few pieces are what actually okay tell
me if you guys do this but when I'm
shopping I'm always window shopping like
always just thinking I want can never be
bothered to queue for the till I'm never
going to actually buy anything I'm just
looking until you see that one piece and
there's always that one piece that
flicks the switch in your head and that
piece turns you from a window shopper
someone who had no intention of buying
anything in - right okay now I'm in
shopping mode and if I pick up one piece
I'll go crazy it's never just like 1 or
2 it's always nothing or loads of things
I digress this is basically the piece or
this collection you'll see what I mean
in a second that turned me from a window
shopper into a primary purchasing a lot
of stuff from Zara today kind of shopper
because I thought this whole collection
that looked very much like a Zimmerman
I'm trying to think what makes sense
with the trial Clips maybe I'll show you
the top first okay so they had quite a
few pieces in this really beautiful
lightweight fabric the top again
actually I have the size small not the
extra small but how Zimmermann ich does
this top look they had the top which I
tried on originally with the lace skirt
that you'll be seeing in the clips now
it is fairly cropped so if you have
something high-waisted underneath and
it's absolutely perfect long sleeves
fairly sheer but you couldn't see my
under on denieth it's got beautiful
ruffle detail buttons that go down the
middle and oh my goodness just the
colors and the material is so gorgeous
so to style with the top you have the
option of the little skirt and this is
just an elasticated waist band really
easy to wear skirt I think this was
super affordable as well annoyingly it
doesn't have a price on it anymore
but I think this was about 17 pounds
like this was really affordable but what
I actually prefer with the top is this
pair of trousers so once again very
Zimmerman
Zimmerman if you're not sure what I'm
talking about is an Australian brand you
would probably recognize it from your
Instagram I have a few Zimmerman pieces
including this white place suit and this
jumpsuit and I just love their pieces
but they're very expensive like those
things were probably 500 to 700 pounds
yeah quite ridiculous and I did tweet
the other day saying does anyone know of
any high street alternatives that are
very similar to Zimmerman and a few
people said sorry so thank you very much
and this most definitely is the way that
the fabric is a little bit faded the
beautiful floral design all the frills
just the way that it's so free-flowing
and bohemian style super-super Zimmerman
- once again this would look gorgeous
with a little t-shirt or even with the
kind of talk that I'm wearing now I wore
it head to toe with the blouse as you
can see in the Tryon Clips I'm sorry
again I've got the lighting in those
changing rooms but you'll probably see
me wearing this stuff on my Instagram
stories so stay tuned to that but this
will be gorgeous for some holidays on so
many different occasions here in the UK
I might wear a head-to-toe this outfit
to the Chelsea Flower Show I'm going ooh
I'm not going to give that away actually
because may or may not be my mom's
birthday present sorry I love your
watching totally giving it away I will
tell him not to watch this video but
yeah I thought that'd be fabulous okay
this next piece is more of a practical
piece and I actually didn't try this one
on so sorry there's no trial Clips but
this is a little white strappy spaghetti
tank top it was a grand total of 1999
and won nine 1999 it has adjustable
straps this is great for not only
wearing by itself as a camisole there's
a vest top it's got a little bit of lace
underneath so it's just a really pretty
little top but also great if the top
that you're wearing is a little bit
sheer this can act as a really nice
underlay almost like a slip so I thought
its to be very very versatile also you
know on those days when it's really hot
outside and maybe you're just chilling
at your own house and you just want
something easy breezy and this is a
really lovely thing for that kind of
occasion so I thought that was a really
nice one you know those pieces that you
just couldn't tell you're going to West
so much I was
that's one of those this one was a bit
of a wild card it's a little bit
different for me but I thought that it
would be really nice for summer holidays
beachy looks it is a crochet crop top as
you can tell I do not like getting my
tummy button out so I would almost
definitely wear this with very high
waisted denim shorts I think the ones
I'm wearing now would be like they come
up to above my tummy button so they're
pretty perfect this could be also really
fab for sticking on over a bikini really
nice some holiday piece and $17.99 so
major winner and then the last thing
that I bought was actually for very
similar reasons as the spaghetti strapp
top that I showed you earlier this is a
body so it actually has a little kind of
crotch Clippy section once again a
really good layering piece for
underneath anything that might be a
little bit sheer but once again it does
have adjustable straps like for our
straps which i think is great
considering how cheap this piece was
normally when you pay $17.99 it has to
price labels one on each side normally
when you pay $17.99 something it doesn't
have the details such as adjustable
straps but this does so this will be a
really great piece for layering
underneath anything sheer or maybe
anything lacy so that you cannot see my
underwear so that's everything that I
actually bought and I'm thrilled to bits
with those purchases I think you'll
agree that they are just so beautiful so
my style the other bits that I tried on
so there was this gorgeous coat and
sorry about the random transcript but I
couldn't find anything that looked
perfect underneath it so I just ended up
trying it on just my underwear so this
coat was just absolutely gorgeous I
loved it so much it was affordable it
was about 69 pounds it had really
gorgeous tassels around sleeves but I
just thought this bit of a weird time of
year to be buying a coat yes this coat
would be amazing for spring or summer
because here in the UK and in most of
Europe it can get quite chilly in the
evenings during spring and summer even
if it's been a hot day but today has
been really warm here in London and you
know when you're just not in the mindset
to buy a coat because it's quite warm so
I definitely had that so didn't pick
that one up maybe if I go
on a cold a day that I might do and then
the next thing that I tried on but
didn't get was this gorgeous white linen
dress it had quite bouffant star sleeves
really lovely button detail down the
middle it was fairly short like I was
glad that it was a lot of fabric up here
because I wouldn't normally show my legs
as much as this dress did it was quite
quite short for me um I didn't get it
because I had picked up the lace dress
which I definitely prefer so I thought
it'd be a little bit excessive to get
two dresses in one haul but I do think
it's beautiful if you've got some
holiday coming up and you are very much
like Zara mango kind of shops are your
vibe then it's absolutely beautiful so
those the pieces that I tried on but
didn't get what I would mention those so
that is everything that I got from my
Covent Garden Zara I did show you a few
more pieces on my Instagram stories if
you guys want to see when I'm going
shopping and kind of like come shopping
with me then check out my Instagram
stories because I do post most of my
shopping on there um also while we're
talking about apps there are a couple of
fashion apps and I'm currently using and
uploading my looks on so to that I use
all the time firstly the like to know
app and secondly the 21 buttons app
which is one that I'm new on but it's
really good for just having all the
outfit information so if you want to see
what I'm wearing on a daily basis and be
able to like click on the photo and get
outfit details then follow me on the
likes to know it app and the 21 buttons
app both of those I post outfits that I
don't post on Instagram so Instagram is
more curated like my favorite looks but
for things that are more casual like gym
outfits traveling to the airport outfit
I post all of those on those two apps so
I'll leave a link down below not
sponsored and so definitely check those
out I will also be running a couple of
giveaways on those apps so if you are
following me on those you'll be able to
see upcoming giveaways for things like
opportunities to actually come shopping
