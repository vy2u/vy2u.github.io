turn out all the lights all I want from
you listen every no no the good James hi
darlings and welcome to a new fashion
video today I'm going to be sharing a
few of my absolute favorite summer
dresses and showing you a few ways to
style them as well for all the many
occasions coming up at this time of year
over the next few months there is so
much look forward to we've got things
like Wimbledon there are countless
engagement parties weddings days at the
races so many occasions are called for
the perfect summer dress not all of
these dresses will be appropriate for
wedding guests outfits but a few of them
are as well as such as this one so this
is going to be quite a casual video I
hope you don't mind this more casual
setup in my living room and I'm going to
be showing you my favourite summer
dresses and how to style them as always
everything that I wear in this video
will be linked in the description box so
just click show more for all the links
and before we get started don't forget
to hit the subscribe button for loads
more fashion videos and give this video
a thumbs up if you'd like to see more of
this type of video from me so without
further ado let's get started okay so
this is the first look and I absolutely
adore the print on this dress you
guessed it it's Ted Baker which is
absolutely one of my go-to brands for
summer special occasions I've actually
made it a bit more casual with this
straw bag which again is another
favorite piece in my wardrobe as you can
see I'm showing the fluted detail on the
sleeves which is a big trend this summer
this next dress also has ruffles on the
sleeves very feminine and this one is a
beautiful broderie anglaise style
material I've paired it with a picnic
basket style handbag again to make it a
bit more casual this would be great for
polo in the park that kind of thing and
then I've gone for some slightly more
flat shoes these are my beaded sandals
from Tory Burch and I love them as I'm
wearing them or they're getting more and
more comfortable and as you can see the
hem of this dress also has a beautiful
ruffled
and it's a really lovely length as well
next up and you guys would not believe
how affordable this dress is how
stunning is this dress it's actually
from a source of would you believe it if
I was going to a prom then I would 100%
wear this it is so so beautiful I love
the princess neckline this whole outfit
is actually really affordable the bag is
actually a dupe it's not a real Chloe
it's from artists on anything and I'm
not sure if I show you my shoes of it
later on I think I wore my Topshop shirt
so yeah and all over High Street outfit
the skirt of this is really voluminous
it's like a tulle netting with beautiful
petal embroidery oh yeah there's shoes
Topshop chunky heel which means you're
not gonna be sinking into the grass and
then a little ankle strap full support
you can also see here that the skirt has
a dip hem which gives it even more of a
smart occasion wave feel the top is
actually like a neoprene material but
how much like princess does this dress
make you look okay so this one is
actually a little bit more casual I
would and have worn this out to meetings
it's just the perfect summer everyday
dress and I just oh my gosh this dress
is just so gorgeous
it's a beautiful pleated material again
it has a fluted style sleeve this is
just such a big trend looks gorgeous
with some really delicate jewelry I
actually wore this with one of my big
Geiger bags which is one of the bags I
use for work because it fits my laptop
in lengthwise as well this dress is
really perfect you'll see again in a
second it comes to just above my knees
and it's just a really floaty easy to
wear style here we go so there's the bag
you can see the length it's got a slight
double hem and then I also wore it with
my Topshop wooden heel shoes this next
one would be so perfect for something
like a skirt or a summer engagement part
actually I don't know if you can wear
white to an engagement party
maybe not but just lovely summer events
if you're going to any red-carpet events
and doing
like that that would be really really
fun this again is from Ted Baker and I
absolutely loved the floral detail on
the neckline I picked this up and chose
my Michael Kors bag which also has a
beautiful Daisy detail and here's a
little close with the bag it's got rose
gold detail on it just like Ted Baker
dresses they all have rose gold on them
somewhere and then footwear wise these
beautiful little sandals from River
Island also have a floral detail all
over them and they're just gonna quite
low heel so it makes a whole look a
little bit more casual alright this is
something that I actually wore to Ascot
myself not Royal Ascot
but it was a May Day Ascot race day a
couple of weeks ago and this is what I
wore love how this fits although I
actually do have a size too big of me
here but it's just the most beautiful
way of fitting to the body love the
colours in this skirt I've got some nude
shoes which work with everything and
again chunky heel which does not get
stuck in the grass and then I added a
bit more glam and matched the champagne
e-gold color of my fascinator to my
Clarion aisle handbag you can see the
fast nature a bit more here this
fascinator is really versatile and you
can get it from ASOS or leave it link
down below now on to the final outfit
this dress is what I wore on the red
carpet in can I wasn't too sure how
smart to go and this dress was
absolutely perfect I think you called
this drape of skirts like a handkerchief
drape because it looks like someone just
picked up a handkerchief but I
absolutely love it it's pinched in at
the waist as well so very very feminine
and floaty again it's got rose gold zip
and buttons at the back and then
footwear wise I have gone with my Jean
Vito Rossi shoes which I don't wear
enough I really need to wear them more
they've got a metallic toe cap and then
the clear
aspects sides this bag is another bag
from our son anything it's not a dupe
they also have some really beautiful
bags on there that aren't tubes such
gorgeous quality yeah you can see the
bag filled with my clothes here and also
you can see that the skirt is actually a
different material to the top of this
dress and it just has the most beautiful
shape to it
I feel so amazing when I wear there's so
elegant I just love it so so much
alright so that's all from me guys I
hope you enjoyed the video and I'll see
you in the next one let me know which is
your favorite dress in the comment
