me for another video all about dupes for
your wardrobe for the upcoming season
these have all got a real spring/summer
focus I think the last time I did a
dupes video is probably probably quite
in the midst of winter so it's about
time I updated you on a few very
designer inspired high street buys that
will hopefully help to elevate your
wardrobe and give you that luxury look
for Less I'm not going to give the whole
spiel on dupes vs. fakes versus designer
inspired pieces because I do that at the
beginning of every chips video so you
can go and watch one of the others if
you would like to know my thoughts on
all of that today I'm just going to be
sharing with you a few pieces I
personally really love and that are very
much inspired by those much higher price
point designer pieces so as always I do
have quite a lot of accessories as well
as clothing pieces to share with you so
I'm gonna get started with Footwear
something that I've been wearing so much
lately and you guys probably have seen
them a million times before if your
regular Watchers of my videos but it is
the misguided dupes of the Valentino
sandals this was a real example of when
I fell in love with the dupes so much
that I then went on to buy the real deal
I then went and spent B I think it was
six hundred six hundred and fifty pounds
on the real designer Valentino sandals
but I realized that these weren't with
so many things in my wardrobe I was so
comfortable and very versatile they work
with sewn different looks I thought you
know what I will get the use out of the
designer item so when I bought the
Valentino's but I still absolutely love
these they are a neutral color so they
go with lots of things the chunky block
heel makes them super comfortable and
perfect for an all day long I feel like
Valentino is a brand that does get very
duped very regularly there is a website
that has dupes of the Rockstar handbag I
will leave some examples on the screen
here and I'll leave the website link
down below if you lust for that rock
stud style handbag but don't quite have
the budget for it
and then also websites such as ego shoes
where there are loads more dupes of
Valentino sandals
speaking of ego this is a pair of shoes
from there and these are inspired by
Jean Vito Rossi shoes I do actually have
a pair of Jean meter roses but I don't
wear them that much because I find that
my feet slips out of them because they
they do
have an ankle strap and my feet are a
little bit small for standard UK size
threes so these have got the full color
pointed toe cap and then the perspex
around the edge of the toes which is
what we see in a lot of the designers
shoes the perspex is actually
surprisingly comfortable but I would say
you do often get a little bit of
condensation in the foot area I don't
think that's particularly hygienic but
just don't wear them for too long not
too long a periods of time
unlike the Jumby Taurasi is these ego
ones which I think were under 30 pounds
have got a perfect strap that goes
around the ankle you might have seen
these in my pictures and my beautiful
Kate Spade dress so for me this actually
makes them more wearable than my jean
beatty Aussies
over the past few months Doon have been
doing quite a lot of dupes as well one
of the most infamous Styles is their
dupe of the Valentino rocks and sandals
the Valentino rock studs I would
actually highly recommend buying I find
them just so comfortable and again they
go with so many things but of course
that's not everyone's taste or budget so
these are really good high street
alternatives I've gone for the white
pair because I have got pink and
metallic in the Valentino's if you're
looking for a high street pair of
wedding shoes then these I think would
be absolutely fabulous they've got the
same strap detail as a Valentino's same
height heel at same pointed toe they
look very very similar but they are a
fraction of the price
poor Valentino they are inspiring so
many different designs but maybe my eye
is naturally drawn Stan because I just
absolutely love Valentino shoes but my
next tubes are from Primark this is a
pair of sandals with the same studded
detail as the Valentino shoes these I
think would be fantastic if you're going
to any festivals or concerts or if
you're going on any summer holidays
where you don't want to take anything
too expensive just in case they get
ruined or heaven forbid lost or stolen I
think these would be a fantastic name to
take with you because they are so
affordable I've taken the price sticker
off but I feel like they were 999 which
is absolutely bonkers and I think they
look really really beautiful and then
the trend that we've all love to hate
recently it is the ugly trainer trend
now there's no way I was going to buy
the actual valance Yaga's or other
brands that are doing the ugly trainer
trend because I actually don't wear
trainers that much open to the gym and
and yeah it was just not a trend that I
wanted to
that's a load of money and I thought I
would go for the high street alternative
the most designer looking versions I
found are these from River Island I mean
if you did show you someone these like a
year ago they'd have been like that is
never gonna be on trend why would anyone
buy those maybe I don't know but I
really wouldn't but those cool girls on
Instagram have made us lost for them so
yeah I just thought these were the best
high street version they look most
similar to the burns Yaga ones are
pretty heavy not gonna lie this yellow
stripe is giving me all kinds of crazy
rides but to take part in the trend I
have gone for this high street pair the
next let's talk about bags and I found
some really great dupes
this time around starting off with this
one from ASOS so transparent bags as you
well know if you watched my spring or
2018 trends video transparency is a huge
trend and aspinall actually brought out
a bag imagined this but with gold
hardware around the corners and a
fabulous line in the middle very very
similar to this other than those details
and that one is around 600 pounds this
was less than the tenth of that price
from ASOS obviously you don't get those
design details but if you did just want
to take part in the perspex bag trend
then this would be a great one for that
a brand that we've seen all over our
Instagram feeds lately is shrimps and
they have some really lovely textured
bags that this bag from Topshop very
much reminded me of this one is made up
of loads of different beads but it's
really effective in that the bag is
pretty much all beaded it gives a very
similar effect to the shrimps bag I
think this would be a great one worn as
a wedding guest bag it is fairly heavy
and you probably have to be quite
careful what you pop in it because it
could get a little bit out of shape but
if you want that shrimps look for a
whole lot less than this one was 29
pounds it's unsurprising with a bag as
iconic as the cult Gaia half moon bag
that there are going to be loads of high
street dupes two of my favorites are
these two now this one is from ASOS I'm
not a huge huge fan of the color but
shape wise this is pretty much identical
to the cult Gaia bags and this was
trying to see the price tag but I think
it was around the 20 pound mark however
I actually prefer this bag this
is from Topshop and it was 32 pounds now
this one I actually prefer to the cult
guy one I think the shape is a little
bit more practical it does come with the
shoulder strap but the shoulder strap is
removable with these little and press
studs which is very very handy so you
can wear it crossbody or just handheld
and then unlike the cult guy it also
comes with a liner with the designer
version of the bag you can just see
everything that's inside if you have any
credit cards or a slim phone it could
very easily slip through the holes in
the wood but not with this one
everything is safe in the lining so all
done Topshop I think they've done really
well at being inspired by those very
popular designer designs but without
outright huffing them whereas this is
pretty much identical
speaking of Topshop another bag that I
saw in there recently that I thought was
absolutely beautiful is this one and it
has very similar shape and design
details to the Gucci Darnassus bag which
I have and I absolutely adore this was
32 pounds and whether you care that it's
designer inspired or not I think this is
a really really lovely handbag it's a
great size if you use an iPad and it
would definitely fit a large iPad in
here as well as all of your other
essentials it does have a chain shoulder
strap inside or you could just wear it
like a clutch bag quite a big clutch bag
but as you can imagine it is the color
that I absolutely adore about this one
like the Gucci darkness it has a few
different textures you've got this
leather effect then you've got some
studs you've got some suede up here as
well and because it is this type of
structure it would expand a little bit
meaning you can pack it full of all of
your daily essentials so a really really
beautiful bag that is a little bit
designer inspired from Topshop this one
is very much inspired by the Chloe I
think it is still called the Chloe pixie
bag but the big version and this is from
dune this I believe was just under 90
pounds so not super affordable but it's
really really lovely on this side you've
got a suede detail and then on the back
it is pure leather I kind of like this
side the best but the fact that it's got
Jun written there kind of ruins the
illusion that you're going for the whole
Chloe look but this big ring is a design
detail that we see in so many Chloe bags
the denial bracelet bags of pixie bags
and it is a design detail that this bag
has as well and it does have these
little hooks here so you can wear it
crossed shoulder
with a body strap as well but I think
it's quite cute just to carry it by
these little gold candles and finally
within the bag section and this is
probably my favorite tip of the entire
video you guys will not be surprised to
hear that it is from artisan anything
this website are just a door for that
amazing quality leather bags and this is
just the most fabulous view before the
Chloe fete de bag I think this is
gorgeous I came very close to actually
buying the Chloe fade a bag myself and I
thought I'm gonna get this one just to
see how much I wear it how well it goes
in my wardrobe and I can confirm that it
really really does this one is of such
good quality though that I think I'm not
gonna get the Chloe one because this
does the job absolutely perfectly
when I first post this on Instagram so
many of you thought that it was a Chloe
Faye it is slightly different in size
the Chloe Faye comes in a size a little
bit smaller and the size a little bit
bigger but this size I find really
really practical it's got the little
magnetic clasp here then inside you've
got a zippy pocket two main sections and
envelope pocket as well as I mentioned
have the crossbody strap and on the back
of the bag you also have a little
envelope pocket which is great for your
Oyster card your tickets things like
that so yeah absolutely love this and I
highly recommend picking up anything
from that website next up I have to
share with you this amazing swimsuit so
you guys may have spotted on my
Instagram stories that I found an
incredible dupe for the Larrabee
swimming costumes lavish is a brand I
think they're Italian and you've seen
their so many costumes all over
Instagram in fact I do have a which they
very kindly sent me with the two
different floral straps but I actually
prefer this one which was around half
the price and it is from Caledonia it
has the floral petal detail around one
shoulder and it's just more structured
it's got almost like a sport bra effect
inside so you feel very supported
I think it's absolutely gorgeous and so
so effective if this is still a little
bit out of your price points because I
think this one is around 90 pounds then
I also share it a lot of my Instagram
stories an incredible high street dupe
from pretty little thing I'll insert a
photo of it here this I think is under
30 pounds so really affordable
I'll leave that one linked down below as
well it comes in white
and in black and I would recommend
sizing up with these sewing costumes so
the slogan hats always come into fashion
at this time of year and this time
around my favorite I don't know if you
can still call it Jeep but it was
originally a designer called Eugenie Kim
that did them and they were really
expensive this one is 25 pounds from
jewels and I think it's probably my
favorite one on the high street at the
moment it just says hello sunshine it's
a great shape clear writing it's good
quality so that would be my top choice
for the designer Sun Hat deep on the
high street at the moment and then we
have a trend that I would never have
spent the money on the designer version
but when I saw this High Street version
of the clear raincoat trend I just
thought you know what I cannot resist it
and I have come to really really love
this coat so it is chanel and Dior that
have clear raincoats probably some other
designers as well the Chanel one I
actually tried on just as a bit of a
cruel joke to myself and it was 1,700
pounds this one it was under 50 pounds
from Topshop the first time I wore this
a very stylish man in the street
actually stopped me and he said oh my
god I love your to your coat and I span
around on my heels and triumphantly told
him it was 40 pounds from Topshop and he
was absolutely shocked but that shows
that this just looks amazing I've
actually worn it a lot I feel like
recently we've had a lot of these
drizzly days and it's absolutely perfect
that I love you can see your outfit
underneath when you're wearing it it's
just great fun a real statement piece
and so much cheaper obviously than the
designer ones and yet the quality I
think is fabulous
Topshop never do poor quality items and
yeah I've just really really enjoyed
wearing this one okay some clothing
pieces I recently picked up this from
Topshop because funnily enough this is
pretty much identical to my Karen Millen
dress I will insert a video clip of my
Karen Millen dress here you guys
absolutely adore this dress when I first
wore it on my Instagram you were so
curious to know where it's from but I
appreciate that the price point of
caramel and things is not to everybody's
taste so when I saw this one from
Topshop I thought I have to get that to
show it as a similar and more affordable
alternative the caramel has a higher
neckline this one has more of a
crossover v-shape
other than that it's really not that
different it's the same kind of broderie
anglaise style material you've got the
waistband you've got the little shorts
which also have the frill at the bottom
and this is just a perfect it'll play
suit for summer so I thought I would
mention that one within the video and
then you may remember if you saw my Zara
haul this fabulous combination of the
top and I also have the trousers and the
skirt from this pattern which I think
are incredible dupes for Zimmerman
Zimmerman is a brand that I absolutely
love I adore the style of the dresses
but they are very expensive so when I
saw this collection in Zara I thought I
actually have to give that a go and I've
been wearing the pieces together or
separately and I think they look so so
expensive so if you haven't nipped in to
Zara lately definitely check it out and
if you haven't seen my Zara haul I'll
leave that linked up on the screen and
also down below so check that out to see
what else I picked up because it's
amazing at the moment and then lastly we
have this adorable little top from
Topshop which again I think is a great
deep for Zimmerman this looks a lot
better on than it does on the hanger so
again I'll insert and overlay clip of me
wearing it here but this is 22 pounds it
has so many design details that are
similar to Zimmerman or with a ladder
detail the ruffle the crossover I just
think this is such a beautiful top and I
had it in my wardrobe for quite a long
time before wearing it and now I'm
gutted I didn't even more at wear out of
it but as we move into summer this is
something that I'm going to be reaching
for a lot and it most definitely has
those Zimmermann vibes about it so I
thought I would also just throw this one
in for good measure
alright so that is everything that I
found a recently on the high street that
is a deep of those fabulous designer
pieces I really hope you enjoyed looking
through my selections if you guys have
found any amazing dupes then let me know
