you my summer morning routine the
weekend edition on the weekends I like
to spend a little more time in the
mornings pampering myself enjoying a bit
of me time so I'm going to share my
favorite ways of indulging in a full
beauty routine from the comfort of my
own home and today's video is in
collaboration with Braun I like to wake
up naturally at the weekends I sometimes
wear an eye mask so that I don't wake up
when the Sun starts to come through the
blinds but more often than not I'm
working by one of my troublesome boys
before too long I keep a face mist by
the side of the bed I find it so
refreshing to just spritz on my skin in
the mornings so as always I make the bed
as soon as I'm up and then I'm having
straight to the bathroom to lightly and
quickly cleanse the skin using these
rose water and water mint-infused pads
which hydrates and cleanse the skin next
it's downstairs
this time hydration from within with a
big glass of water and then of course my
morning tea ritual in the summer I
really like this refreshing lemon mint
tea with a bit of honey as well
sometimes I make myself something
healthy for breakfast but today I'm just
having one of my favorite banana and
chocolate shake yogurts so yummy I take
it through to the lounge where I'll kiss
my babies while I drink my tea
I cannot even handle their cuteness look
at those little faces if it's a nice day
we'll play outside where I'll usually
finish off my yogurt under the watchful
eye of Dexter and Dickens
they are such little terrors always
playing
some days I'll go to the gym and some
days I'll just do a chilled workout at
home I put on my gear and apply a little
aromatherapy oil just to help me further
unwind and then it's down to the lounge
or a garden to stretch there's a variety
of workout apps that I use but I also
sometimes just go to youtube and find a
yoga session to follow this one is
specifically designed to enhance your
energy which sounds pretty good to me as
you may imagine I usually have some
company while doing at home workouts so
I keep them short and sweet and before
long I'm back to playing with the boys
after my workout it's time to pamper I'm
applying an enzyme peel which helps to
loosen any dead skin with natural fruit
enzymes as much as I love getting a
professional facial it's just so much
quicker and more affordable to recreate
one at home and one of my essential
tools for doing so is the Brawn face bar
it's the world's first epilation
cleansing and skin vitalizing system all
in one I've been using this for years
and now it comes with a skin vitalizer
pad great for and you just want to pack
up your complexion but without the need
to visit the salon I use the brush to
remove my face mask before hopping in
the shower and applying my usual shampoo
but on pampered days I like to cover my
hair in a deep violet conditioner which
nourishes as well as neutralizes any
warm tones in my hair I brush it through
leave that to sink in for 15 minutes
during which my pamper routine continues
I'm using a lightly foaming face
cleanser and the bronzed face bar once
again to maximize the benefits of the
cleanser the vibration from the brush
helps to give a deep pore cleanse which
is up to six times more effective than
manual cleansing alone there's a normal
and a sensitive brush available
depending on your skin's needs then it's
time for a second face mask this one is
called the problem solver and I find it
great for so many skin problems such as
redness blemishes dryness it just seems
to help with them all
I'm applying this with a brush and then
allowing it to dry meanwhile I'm using
the braun silk-épil 9 skin spa firstly
with the exfoliating brush head which
once again is far more effective than a
manual scrub personally I find it leave
my skin in the perfect condition ahead
of applying fake tan
on those real pamper days I use the new
body selling massager pad which now
comes with the braun silk-épil 9 skin
spa I love to use it with a sumptuous
oil for a blissful at-home massage and
it gives a deep massage to help
stimulate blood circulation all over the
body of course the function we all know
and love the bronze silk appeal for is
the appellate er perfect for summer
thanks for long-lasting results but also
you can do it in just a few seconds at
home anytime it's super convenient in
the long run as well these at home
beauty treatments are saving me hundreds
of pounds as well as countless hours
spent in beauty salons and yet the
results are equally as fabulous
now I'm asked is ready to come off
sometimes I use the normal bristle brush
head from the face bar but today I'm
giving the skin vitalizer pad ergo
agenda massages and peels to reveal
smooth and radiant skin you could even
apply a serum or moisturizer with it to
enhance your glow as with all the brush
heads it's super easy to clean just
under running water so after rinsing the
shower I'm popping my hair up in a towel
and applying a nourishing and hydrating
eye cream
and then my current favorite super
hydrating moisturizer my usual hair
routine consists of spritzing
conditioning spray all throughout my
hair and then the oil on the tips to
really nourish and help with styling
then I'm quickie blow-drying to about
80% dry I'm going to leave the rest to
dry naturally yeah my usual weekend
shows include cleansing my makeup
brushes so that's next on the agenda
just using some normal soap and then
this handy cleansing pad then I apply
some natural makeup just the essentials
lip balm some brow gel and the touch of
mascara while I've been busy pampering
Charlie who's made a juice lots of
ginger in this one to keep our immunity
topped up and I'll enjoy that while
catching up on YouTube comments and any
urgent work before stealing just a
little bit more meat I'm just I'm doing
my nails in the comfort of my own home
as well I find that the products you can
buy in the store now are just so good if
you really don't even need to go into
the salon so I'm using a cuticle oil
first and then a strengthening base coat
before my favorite sparkling nail color
the following morning I'll sometimes
apply a gel topcoat and this will make
them even more long-lasting the final
step in my summer morning routine is to
get some lovely fresh air
I'm putting the harnesses on the boys
and then we're ready to go and enjoy the
sunshine so that's it from me thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
next time bye
