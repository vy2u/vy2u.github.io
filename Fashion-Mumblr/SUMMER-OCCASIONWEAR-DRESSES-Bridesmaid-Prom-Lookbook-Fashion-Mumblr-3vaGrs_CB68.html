five summer special occasion dresses
I get asked about occasion where quite a
lot and there's nothing I love more than
getting dressed up in relief sparkles
and some pretty shoes so your wish is my
command
this first one is incredibly fabulous
the bodice is covered with intricate
sequin and beaded embroidery and a full
length skirt is the most beautiful tool
material it's fitted in at the way
giving an elegant silhouette and the
pink shade is so feminine but without
being immature I paired it with my jean
beatty off shield one of only three or
four pairs of designer shoes I own I
much prefer to invest in classics like
this and simple elegant jewelry
next up is a more classic number this
one I feel is perfect for summer
weddings
again a very ladylike length but the way
that it hangs keeps it useful and once
again coordinate the waist making it
very flattering on the figure
I wore it with these beautiful pearl
sandals which are under 20 pounds I just
love them I adore this one perfect for
summer garden parties or perhaps the
dance races there's something quite
Prairie girl about this and I love
two-tiered handle to give it a really
fun and flirty vibe you've probably
spotted a new bag on the scene this one
it was an absolute bargain from the
carpet land I'll leave a link to where
you can also pick it up in the sale down
in the description box below
oh wow I could quite happily get mired
in this dress I absolutely adore it on
that note
- don't wear this one to a wedding but
if you've got another special occasion
coming up your birthday or perhaps a
ball from or another celebration and
it's simply defined can I leave the
dress number one the bodice is detailed
is gorgeous embroidery and the
high-waisted skirt gives the illusion of
long legs and put a beautiful drape to
it thanks to the high quality tool
material
finally and possibly the one I see
myself getting the most use out of this
drop hem pink lace dress is perfect the
wedding gap and many other fun location
I paired it with my necklace prep
abstraction with a beautiful pearl heel
detail and my usual jewelry all of which
will be linked down below
I hope you guys enjoyed this summer
occasion my lookbook and let me know
your favorite dress in the comments

rotations you are looking forward to you
to get dressed up for I'm for watching
