me for today's video we're going to be
talking all about summer
2018 trends today these are amongst my
favorite videos to film you may remember
I did a very similar chatty video for
the spring trends and also for the
overall 2018 trends if you didn't catch
those then a lot of those trends are
still very much relevant so I'll leave
them linked down in the description box
for you to check those out as well there
are also some overlaps going on some
trends just how serious longevity this
year so definitely check those videos
out if you haven't already if you're new
to my channel then hello and welcome
thank you so much for joining me you'll

content hear things like trend videos

subscribe button and also click the
notification bell so you don't miss any
of my upcoming videos tomorrow is summer
solstice which means solstice solace
solstice solstice which means it is
officially the first day of summer
tomorrow so what a perfect time to share
with you my favorite trends that are
coming up for the upcoming months as I
mentioned in all my previous videos I
personally love to have a wardrobe
filled with more classic long-lasting
and timeless pieces so when it comes to
trends I'm very selective firstly so
this is going to be more of a
inspiration video as opposed to a Show
and Tell I'm going to be sharing with
you my high street picks letting you
know which of the trends I think are the
most wearable which trends I'll be
investing in but as always when it comes
to these more trend led pieces I always
go to the high street if I'm not sure if
something is going to have longevity or
if it's going to work for my wardrobe
then I'll always go to the more
affordable options so a lot of the
retailers as I'm mentioning in today's
video are brands like Topshop River
Island ASOS mango they're all very
affordable retailers and as always
everything that I mentioned in the video
will be linked down in the description
box below so just click show more for
all the info and to do your shopping so
I'm going to get started with the first
trend that we're going to be seeing
coming up in the summer season and that
is Crayola colors this is a trend that's
already infiltrated the high street and
I mentioned in the 2018 overall trend
video that this year was seeing a lot
more fun and playful trends and this is
definitely one of those for me with a
wardrobe filled with pasture holes light
colors it can be a little bit
challenging but I have found a few
really beautiful pieces that will help
update my wardrobe for the summer trends
Crayola colors are these really bright
bold colors they can be a little bit
challenging to wear and the most
favorable way to where the trend is
actually head-to-toe so color blocking
is something that you can really have
fun with this season such as wearing a
pair of bright green trousers with a
yellow jumper purple shoes that could
look totally ridiculous but that is on
trend this summer for me the most
wearable way of injecting this trend
into your wardrobe is with accessories
this pair of yellow block heels are only
40 pounds and I think they look
incredibly comfortable incredibly easy
to wear and this would be a really
fantastic way of injecting a Crayola
color into your wardrobe without going
head-to-toe crazy with the look I
personally pair these with a pair of
white cropped jeans I have a really
lovely pair of beige II white jeans from
Topshop and maybe just a loose-fitting
blouse then your usual handbag you are
showing a nod to the trend without going
all-out equally this pair of slingback
shoes even brighter in color so a great
way of injecting that trend into your
wardrobe if you're feeling very bold you
could get a more statement piece in a
bold Crayola color such as this green
jacket this is a double-breasted coat
once again it is from the high street so
still very affordable and you could pair
this over some of your classic pieces in
your wardrobe if like me you have a lot
of neutral pieces that are a lot more
long lasting a lot more timeless then
adding something like this over the top
is a great way of really going for it
being a lot more bold in the way that
you wear the trend but still it's only
35 pounds so you're not making a major
investment in what could be a very
flash-in-the-pan trend as I mentioned I
always love to go for accessories and
I'm trying to inject a trend without
being untrue to my personal style
so this handbag is another great way of
wearing the Crayola color trend without
totally rejigging your entire wardrobe
personally I love when trends are more
accessory focused so trend number two
which is the shell jewelry trend is
something
I'm really excited to wear I think the
number one way of wearing this trend is
probably to pick up something on your
travels if you're going away anywhere if
you're going abroad or to a seaside town
then picking up some genuine shell
jewelry it's probably the best way to do
it but we've seen this on multiple
designers and already the high street
has adopted this trend you can adopt
this trend in a really affordable way as
well I've seen already that ASOS have
this set of six stud earrings including
shells and starfish designs and it's six
pounds per three studs so really easy
and affordable way to adopt the trend
and then also mango mango are always
fantastic at trends like this they have
got some beautiful shell jewelry I'll
show you a few examples on the screen
now that I have made a mango order and
I'm very much looking forward to my
shell jewelry arriving especially this
pendant with thee and if you say conch
or conch shell I'm not sure but this
shell I think is going to be a really
lovely one to wear with a top like this
when your whole neckline is showing a
very subtle trend but it's one that I'm
really looking forward to wearing
another trend which is filtered down
from the designers such as shrimps to
the high street already is beaded bags
and not just the clear plastic ones but
also wooden ones I think that this trend
has slightly been influenced by the
whole Palm Beach vibes that are going on
that we've seen all over the catwalks
and so we're also seeing the wooden
trends that always remind me of the
massage things that taxi drivers in hot
countries have on the back of their
chairs do you guys know what I'm talking
about
but this Topshop bag which I actually
photographed as part of my spring
lookbook this one here that very much
reminds me of that that is top shops way
of doing the beaded bag but then also
mango and Topshop have a few different
options which are kind of a cross
between this more tropical style and the
shrimps bag one of my favorites is this
one which has the fringing at the bottom
I think this would look great for any
upcoming travels once again super
affordable and then this bag here is
also a bit of a nod to another trend
which is coming out which is rainbow
again very affordable on the high street
but this is a really great way of taking
it to trends off with one accessory then
the clear bead style of bags a lot more
similar to the designer shrimp one which
is on a lot of people's wish lists
there's this small one with a little top
handle and then also this bigger beaded
shopper the beaded shopper I would say
probably my favorite one of all the high
street bags I'm very tempted let me know
what you think should I go for this one
it is a little bit more expensive not on
the scale of the designer bags buts be
honest I think the beaded bag trend is
one that I'm not in love with enough to
invest designer but I am willing to
invest in a slightly higher quality high
street ones I think this one maybe the
one that I go for all right so I already
gave you a bit of a hint but the next
trend that we're going to be seeing
everywhere is rainbow this is one that
for a pastel neutral white wardrobe
person like myself is a little bit
challenging as you can see actually
behind me I do have a few more colors in
my wardrobe lately and that's still very
much on the pink and coral scale that's
where I'm most comfortable so once again
I'm going to be keeping it quite subtle
just showing a nod to the rainbow trend
as opposed to going all out once again
the high street is super speedy at
adopting these trends who are already
seeing little cami tops such as this one
it's only 22 pounds I believe a really
affordable and fun way to wear the
rainbow trend you could just easily pack
this in your holiday suitcase or if
you've got any again Beach trips coming
up with a pair of denim shorts denim
jeans this will look really really cute
and very easy to wear and then an even
more subtle way of wearing the rainbow
trend is with a pair of jeans
such as these a classic pair of jeans
very nondescript from the front but from
the side you have this rainbow stroke
which is really cool really subtle and
my opinion a lot more wearable you could
inject those into your wardrobe in place
of your normal jeans I actually don't
have that many jeans but if I did then I
would definitely go for ones like this
which is very subtly show my
appreciation for the rainbow trend now I
personally think that you can take a
trend as you want to it doesn't have to
be within the rules it doesn't have to
be exactly the trend so I would count
this jumpsuit as a rainbow trend because
of the amazing rainbow zigzags down at
the bottom now I guess there's kind of
controversial this looks a little bit
Mazzoni ish but it's actually I think 18
a Devlin under 90 pounds under hundred
pounds from the high street this looks
very Mazzoni to me and looks very
designer inspired it's got that slight
rainbow trend going on at the bottom for
me this is a dream piece for wear on
some
and I think I am again going to make the
investment for this particular piece it
is still high street still affordable
but to me it's a lot more wearable so a
lot easier to adopt that specific trend
was something I know I'm going to get a
lot of use out of finally for the
rainbow trend I just had to show you
this jute bag this is a really good dupe
or feed your shopper bags
and it's rainbow print so another tick
tick again I think this is one that I
may invest in I think that these bags I
say invest it's 35 pounds I find that
these guys are super practical literally
for shopping if I'm nipping to
Sainsbury's or wherever or if I'm having
one of those days where I want to carry
a really cute crossbody bag but I still
have my laptop I have my makeup bag and
God knows what else with me then this
would be a really practical bag to have
with me and also a good way of adding
that trend to of my look the next trend
and this one I'm most definitely
included way back in January in my 2018
trends video is transparency we have
seen transparency probably one of the
biggest trends of the year and summer is
gonna see it ramping up even more I'm
going to pop my coffee down now because
I actually do have a few examples these
next few trends I actually already have
some in my wardrobe so I can show you
some physical things but first let me
ditch the coffee
okay so regular viewers will not be
surprised to see this bad boy appearing
this was um a bit of a bottom a bit of a
whim but oh my goodness I love it I have
been so obsessed with this since I've I
almost pray for those like drizzly days
or in its a little bit rainy but not
rain enough that you need an umbrella
because this is just so fun that this
was 49 pounds
it was Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel not
this it was Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel
that first brought out this really cool
rain wear idea um the Chanel catwalks
were covered in very cool very expensive
raincoats but the high street now have
their versions no way am I going to
spend over a thousand pounds on a
raincoats but under fifty pounds
I can manage if I was a festival type
person then this would be super
practical I'm not but what I love about
this is it really showcases your outfit
underneath super practical and very
on-trend it's that's my number one piece
for the transparency trend which is not
going anywhere this summer and then next
a very easy way to where the
transparency trend is with shoes these
are actually designer these are my Jean
Vito Rossi shoes I love them I don't
wear them enough cuz I actually don't
find them particularly comfortable
everybody else that I know has his shoes
so that they are comfortable I think
actually my nards had too big
that's probably why but they are
stunning might have got the rose gold
tip and they actually have little
breathing holes because the problem with
this transparency and perspex trend is
that your feet get a little bit let's
just say there's a bit of condensation
going on inside the shoes jeongmi
Taurasi have little holes I guess you
could actually put your own holes just
use a dart or a needle or something in
your high street ones I wouldn't
recommend butchering your designer ones
but this is where I want to show you the
original because next I also have some
views so I have a couple of pairs of
oops they both are very affordable I
think both of these were under 30 pounds
these ones are probably the most similar
to my jean beatty attrocities they have
got the rose gold toe cap although the
straps are a little bit more convoluted
they're not slip on like the ones I just
showed you however there are some dupes
which are almost identical in shape and
style and set a photo here don't know
how we get away with it apparently for a
dupe to not be a counterfeit it has to
have eight design differences I don't
think there are that many in this pair
but they're super affordable yeah these
are the ones that I first purchase my
first dupe they've got a very skinny
stiletto heel metallic they look really
lovely and then more recently funnily
enough with the same strap design but
not from the same retailer I have this
pair these have a suede toe cap and a
suede heel so do not wear these if
you're going anywhere that could be
slightly wet or grassy because they will
get destroyed but a really good way of
wearing the trend the transparency trend
and without spending a fortune if you
don't like that particular status shoe
then panic knots the high street still
has loads of affordable pieces that are
included in the transparency trend this
pair of yellow sandals I think it could
be very comfortable they've got a lovely
little low block heel and again you're
getting that Crayola color in there as
well so that's a two trend tick on those
ones the transparency trend can also be
seen in bags Aspen all did the clear
trunk bag and then we're also seeing a
Crayola color transparency again mixed
into one in high street bags such as
this lovely green one you do have to be
careful what you put inside I would
definitely recommend using a little dust
bag to keep all of your essentials
tucked away from any prying eyes but
it's a great way of great way of running
the trend and because it's an accessory
a bag again you can stick to your normal
look for just show and not to trend or
something like this and then once again
blending the Crayola trend and the
transparency trend is this raincoat if I
didn't have my Topshop one already I
would be very tempted by this one I love
the color it looks really really fun
it's kind of like a Barbie pink says
very much my style and colorway and very
affordable as well I think as long as 45
pounds on the high street
so another double tick when it comes to
the trends my final trend for summer is
smoking and I'm actually wearing some
smoking now some people call this type
of material a shirred material SH I
double our IDI
I personally call it smoking I love this
trend I think it is so flattering it is
so comfortable and just easy to wear I
absolutely love it and the great thing
is once again at the high street are
doing it the premium retailers doing it
the designers are doing it and it all
kind of looks the same I'm not gonna lie
I'm about to show you my Tory Burch
bikini River Island ASOS Topshop they
have some that are pretty much identical
and the material is nearly always the
same it's just slightest design details
that make it more expensive so high
street winds with this particular trend
this top I love this is from coast it's
got loads of different design details
you can make the sleeves puffy you can
bring them down a bit I think it's
really flattering around the chest area
you don't have to wear a bra if you
don't want to so yeah love this this is
the bikini I was telling you about
I've had this will quite a long time but
Tory Burch bring out bikinis like this
very very often this is the bando top
I actually was wearing this bikini when
Charlie proposed and I'll always
remember it for that reason but I
absolutely love it I find it very
flattering very easy to wear I don't
normally like bikinis but this one I
just love some reason then these are
little bottoms I think it's in sale at
the moment actually so yes check the
links down below because I do love it I
do love it more than my house three ones
I have two
I'm going to insert photo on the screen
now of one of the high street smoking
detail bikinis this one is more colorful
again slightly going on to the rainbow
trend they're very very flattering again
I think I might invest in that one there
are also some really beautiful ways of
wearing smoking in your everyday outfit
such as this dress here I love the
fluted sleeves I love the color and you
can tell that this is the type of dress
it'll be so comfortable and easy to wear
so my holiday is walking around town or
wherever you might be doing summer
barbecues really lovely very relaxed and
a great on trend affordable peace if you
don't want to go all out with something
like a dress then there are some really
beautiful camisole top such as this one
which once again that has the rainbow
trend in there as well with the
embroidery I think this looks so so
flattering again I think this might be
one that I add my personal shopping list
let me know if you like it as well it's
something else that I have in my
wardrobe with some smoking detail is
this gorgeous long skirt I got this for
our upcoming trip to Valencia I think it
is very Spanish very Valencian it's
almost like the Spanish tile print but
it has got smoking on the waist which is
going to be the most comfortable thing
ever it's going to cinch you in at the
waist a little bit and also mean you can
eat as much as you want and expand as
much as you want so that's a real winner
there are three more trends which I
think are going to be huge this summer
and they are buttons basket bags and
botanical prints but I thought this
video would go on for a very long time
if I spoke about those as well so have
actually done a blog post with my
wishlist pieces for those three final
trends my blog is fashion mumbler calm
and I do a lot of fashion content on

of my outfits get shown on there so if
