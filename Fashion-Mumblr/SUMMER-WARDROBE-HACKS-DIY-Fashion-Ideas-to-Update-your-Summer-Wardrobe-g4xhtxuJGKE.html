so much for joining me for today's video
today something really different for me
I've never really done one of these kind
of DIY Pinterest hacks type of videos
before so I really hope it's something
that you're going to like personally I
have always been quite a crafty person I
love making boring things more fun
gluing and sticking in the adding
glitter and all that kind of thing so I
thought today's video could be along
those sort of lines if you guys have
stumbled across this video and you're
new to my channel I mostly make fashion
beauty and trouble type of videos and if
that sounds like your kind of thing then
please hit the subscribe button it down
in this little bottom corner here I make
two or three videos every single week
and it'll be amazing if you would join
me for future videos so back to today
today I wanted to share with you a few
things which I've been making recently
there's just some really easy ways on
how to update things that you may
already have in your wardrobe or perhaps
you've purchased a few summer things and
you just want to make them a little bit
more unique so not everybody down the
beach or in the local park is wearing
the same thing as you so without further
ado let's get started
so first up is this pair of patched
denim jeans we first saw the trend of
these motifs from the likes of Daniel
Hill Marsh but it's now filtered down to
shops such as Topshop so these are my
favorite pair of jeans which sadly they
used to be white but they're now lilac
because I put them in the washing
machine with a lilac sleeping bag liner
you might recognize them from my blog or
Instagram it's this beautiful pair of
white jeans now I look but I absolutely
love the fit of them so I want to
continue wearing them I decided to dye
them I was toying up between doing them
blue or black but in the end I decided
to use dylon jeans blue dye it's really
easy to use it's a salt based dye which
means you don't need anything else other
than what's inside this little sachet
you simply put your item in the washing
machine cut open the dyes tip the
contents into the drum and then set it
off at 40 degrees that's all you have to
do it's so easy can't really go wrong so
40 degrees and I shortened my cycle
because I'm impatient an hour and 20 is
plenty longer and they came out like
this so much more wearable than the
lilac color to add the motifs as seen
here in a Topshop pair I simply got some
iron-on transfers these ones are from
skinny dip I think the patterns are so
cute and then I line them up in a few
different places just checking where I
want them to go and then when I'm happy
where they're where they're positioned I
simply put one of these ion sheets on
top mine's got hold on I know not sit
not perfect and then I just use the iron
making sure that I go right into the
corners because you don't want the
corners peeling off especially on this
smaller one which is very pointy has
lots of corners just make sure you
thoroughly iron it keeping the iron
moving at all times just to make sure
you don't burn and there you go so
simple two steps and you've got your
very own unique pair of motif teams in
this beautiful denim color you'll notice
that the stitching is still white and
this is because the dial on does not
work on synthetic fabrics which is
actually a really nice design detail
secondly pearl sunglasses now these you
may have spotted from the likes of
Chanel or Givenchy but I made mine for
around three pounds starting with a pair
of H&amp;amp;M sunglasses with some super glue
and some hobby craft pearls it really is
a simplest thing to do so just with
these three things you start with your
pearls and to be honest it's much
quicker if you take all the pearls that
you're going to use off the sheet first
and then taking the superglue really
carefully add a tiny dots of glue onto
the top of the sunglasses and then use
some tweezers to position the pearl
being really quick with the exact
positioning before the glue dries
because super glue dries really really
quickly so just continue this process
across the top the sunglasses trying not
to use too much glue because although it
does dry clear you can still see the
little mounds and ensuring that all the
pearls even your face
when it comes to doing the first pearl
on the second lens just make sure it's
exactly symmetrical just spend a few
moments really perfecting the location
of the first pearl because you don't
want to have wonky looking eyes and it
does make a difference is they're not
symmetrical and because the glue tries
straight away if you use superglue these
are literally ready to air within a few
moments how easy is that
absolutely love these I think that
Chanel ones over 300 pounds and I
actually think I prefer my H&amp;amp;M version
and finally the pom-pom clutch I have
been dying to get my hands on a pom-pom
clutch for so long but I just couldn't
find one that I absolutely loved so I
decided to make one myself starting with
this really plain clutch bag it's a good
quality one it's got some nice trimming
around the edges and the funnest part is
choosing the pom-pom so I played around
with loads of different patterns and I
decided to go with red white and paint
because that'll go with most of my
wardrobe and I just love how these
colors look together so once you've
decided on what color combination and
what pattern you're going to go for it's
time to get gluing once again my main
tool is super glue so I've made some
room on the kitchen table if you're a
bit messy then maybe put some newspaper
down and then it literally is as simple
as adding some glue onto the strong I
don't recommend putting on the pom-pom
because the pom-pom just absorbs it and
then really pushing down on the pom-pom
until you can feel that it's stuck in
place repeat this with all the pom-poms
making sure that you've pushed them nice
and close together so they don't get too
Gaffey and then I also then put a little
bit of glue at the top of the pom-poms
just they didn't roll down and to ensure
they all were kind of sitting at the
same angle if that makes sense so there
we have it for really fun ways to DIY
your summer wardrobe this season I
