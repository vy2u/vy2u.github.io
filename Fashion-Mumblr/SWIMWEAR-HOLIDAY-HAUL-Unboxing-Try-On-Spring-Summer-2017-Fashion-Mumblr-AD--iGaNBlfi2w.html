joining me for today's video which is
going to be a collective swimwear haul
for the spring 2017 season so I don't
know about you but my Instagram feed at
the moment is totally full of people on
incredible beach holidays I've got some
three me I've got la although actually
plenty where you watch this I might be
in LA and I'm going to join the ranks of
those people spamming up your instagrams
but yet really got me thinking about my
upcoming holiday wardrobe and swimwear
in particular there are so many
beautiful my designs are available on
the host at the moment and I can't
resist picking up a few and sharing my
splurges with you in this collective
haul so I've been shopping on ASOS
misguided and also mango which is kind
of new on my radar for hauls and I've
never been a mango ball before and so I
thought I'd share with you some where I
picked up and also because my
self-control is very bad I also picked
up from holiday essentials as well so
I'm going to share with you what I
picked up today's video is in
collaboration with collect plus and if
you are a Shopaholic like me chances are
you've probably already heard of them
because if you love to do your shopping
online the services they provide is such
a lifesaver basically you can get your
shopping or just delivered to your local
collector which there are over 6000 in
the UK in super convenient places often
petrol stations shopping centers near
train station et cetera mine happens to
be a little corner shop about 30 seconds
down the road so it's fantastic if I
have really big boxes that I don't want
to have to take all the way from your
post office they often open rule 8 and
even before I head off to work so just
convenience and it's absolute maximum
also do up with all my favorite
retailers ranging from John Lewis I've
even picked up a kettle for who collects
less before misguided a sauce River
Island even espresso I picked up capsule
to my local collectors before so it's
really fantastic service rate if you are
a busy person you're out the health of
work most a week and you never have to
worry about missing an order because
even if you make purchases from various
retailers like I have done today all of
your shopping can be sent to collect us
so you pick up whatever is convenient
for you have you said that the downside
of online shopping is that of course you
don't get to trial in the store so I
often have quite a lot of returns so
collectors of course it's just super
easy put everything back in the bag or
box put the collector stick around and
take it to your local collectors
drop-off points and they thought the
rest out for you it literally could not
be any simpler so without further ado
I'm going to share with you the bits and
bobs that I picked up today I went
shopping ever mentioned a softness
guided and mango so I'm gonna get
started with a saw this swimming costume
looks so so good on the model and I
think that neon colors are just so
flattering and they're so i catching
during the summer I think that's a
spring in particular these pastel colors
are just going to look absolutely
gorgeous I picked this up and from ASOS
I believe actually a sauce own brand I
really like the kind of bandage Silas's
hopefully it's coming really flattering
and also when it comes to swimwear I
quite like these almost retro designs so
I felt that this was a little bit of a
flashback style with these really kind
of garish colors but yeah really looking
forward to starting this up I can
imagine wearing this on Venice Beach and
in LA and definitely bad cyber pool as
well so yes very much looking forward to
trying this on despite the fact that I
have also been going to the gym for the
past god knows how long
I still just feel so much more
comfortable wearing a swimming costume
so if I was going on a proper hardcore
like tanning holiday comes with SPF of
course I probably would be more inclined
to go for bikinis but I feel like this
trip we've got coming up is going to be
a little bit more of a supposing trip
it's actually not mega hot in LA at the
moment so yeah not to worry about the
tan lines and just want to look cool and
I think this will tick all the boxes
sorry if the lighting of this video
keeps changing as well I'm using
daylight and not my artificial lights so
can't control the sunshine so yeah sorry
is it following you and while I went
onto Aesop's to look at a swimmer I also
had a sneaky peek at the new infection
throughout and totally fell in love with
this beautiful little grocery on low top
which is actually French Connection what
I love about April is uploading
favorite brands are just in one place
and I can make them over just having a
Tall Ships out in one go so even more
convenient but this yet this is the
French Connection top it's got this
really beautiful deep plunging
v-neckline
somewhere so what I'm wearing today and
then it kind of flips into a speaking
sign and then the broderie anglaise down
at the bottom as well I think this will
be a gorgeous way of dressing up jeans
on million slightly cooler days out in
the US and I also really love this drill
detail on the sleeve so keep an eye on
my Instagram stories and la vlogs if
you'd like to see that one in action and
then for traveling I've picked up this
blush colored pink wrap dress now if
you've been watching my channel for a
while you may recognize this design for
actually bought a light blue version of
this last year and of course as soon as
I saw it come out in pink I absolutely
how to get it this dress is perfect for
traveling it's like a stretchy jersey
material the most comfortable thing in
the whole world and because you kind of
tie it around the waist it is so
flattering I'm definitely going to
wearing this on like the internal
flights not going to lie I'm going to
wearing track the awesomes on the
long-haul flights oh yeah internal
flight I'll definitely be wearing this
it has got a large slit so it can be
quite revealing as well but you know the
finished fabric it can also be very
moderate modest and then you've got this
band of fabric which ties in at the
waves giving you the most beautiful
silhouette and also really flattering
sleeve length it comes down to about
here I'm hoping they've not changed
anything about the design from the blue
one I had last year because it really
was such a gorgeous piece attracted
certainly complements and I think it
under 30 pounds so yeah you'll be seeing
me wearing us a lot so definitely check
out the links that I'll leave down below
if you want to shop anything pieces I
have another eighth of bag here I did
actually make two orders on the same day
because I don't know I just discovered
something else on the website and
another great thing about collectors is
that I can just bundle all my those
orders into one box and then what I
normally do is just stick all the
different collector stickers on and
which actually comes in your little
returned packet I'm sure you guys are
all done April's returns before but
collect a few literally just tick
whatever you want
take the collect plastic or stick on
your box any raise ago so when I do
multiple orders or do multiple returns I
tend to stick them all in the base box
and then put all the collects up
stickers on so really really easy
inside this order is another branded
piece from a sauce this is a Ted Baker
dress I told you I get easily distracted
when shopping for my but I made eyes on
this dress and I think it is the most me
thing that I have ever seen it's
basically this beautiful day dress with
Daisy prints at the top I'll show you
some close-ups really small baby
embroidery here and then you have like a
daisy chain belt and then it just goes
into this beautiful dress shape this is
honestly so stunning it's lovely thick
materials this is going to be so nice
for any summer occasions and I think the
silhouette is gonna be absolutely
gorgeous
it's got pockets to the business is
going to look absolutely fabulous so
excited to try this on and yeah if this
fits perfectly it's going to be another
one that I can tell I'm going to wear so
much weather four days out of meetings
or special events on holiday such a
beautiful piece next up is misguided and
I absolutely love misguided swimwear
because they often have dupes for higher
end brands I picked up some Maria juice
not long and going into scalloped edge
ones but I can't actually remember what
I got in this particular order so that's
open it up and have a look okay now I
remember
so when it comes to sewing costumes the
stripes are most definitely a china
we're going to be seeing a lot of this
summer and I feel like Italian Riviera
style is also going to be really big
thanks to a lot of the instagramers that
were there recently so this I felt
picked both boxes it's just such an
almost retro design I think to be
striped it can be so flattering and it's
also got a low-cut back which means
going to get a nice tan on your back if
you are sunbathing in it as well I think
the colors of this will be so flattering
I think the pale colors against tan skin
will look super and this peachy color is
also reflashing on pretty much every
single skin tone as well this as it's
from misguided I think was under 20
pounds I was
links will be down below but I think
that this could almost be a designer
some suits the style is so classic so
chic timeless and really looking forward
to starting this up and you'll
definitely be spotting this on Instagram
I'm sure
also from misguided I picked up this
pair of white leg white palazzo trousers
I actually thought these would work
really well with the swimming costume so
sometimes if you are maybe at a beach
bar you just want to cover up a little
bits gun grab a drink or grab something
to eat it's nice to have a really trendy
pair of trousers got trendy that makes
me feel like a dress Oh granny I'd like
to have a really classic pair of
trousers that as overtopping the
swimming costumes to make it into more
of an outfit so I picked up these for
this reason that is totally plain really
wide leg trousers again very Italian
Riviera style I can imagine these with a
with a straw hat to just look absolutely
gorgeous and they've got a band around
the waist as well so they should tuck in
and create a beautiful silhouette around
the waistline too so that's going to be
an outfit and a swimsuit combination
that I will love wearing in the coming
month and finally is my haul from mango
and my hair would tend to go overboard
with their packaging the box was
absolutely ginormous might actually
decanted it in the shop into the same
tree bag because I could not carry it
down the street even though it's so
close to the house but super convenient
to pick it up so close to where I live
and not have to wait around at home for
this so let me show you what I picked up
from mango okay I've made a bit of an
error here it looks like I've
accidentally ordered to bikini bottom
instead of ordering the bikini bottom
and the top which has been an error but
what I meant to buy was a really cute
crochet bikini set I absolutely loved
crochet bikinis I've had my eye on a set
from their supporters for so long and
then I spotted this set on mango and
they were pretty much identical but a
fraction of the price
so I've snapped it up as soon as I saw
it crochet bikinis are a timeless bikini
style they always come into fashion and
summer they are so Instagram well they
look great and they're really
comfortable as well so this is a stringy
bikini so you're going to get really
nice turn it's not going to be too
covering on the bottom as well I hate it
when bikinis like
your entire barn so unflattering whereas
mango I guess because it's detached yeah
a little bit more flattering so let me
go check that I didn't also order the
top but yeah it's definitely going to
have to return this second crochet
bikini bottom style lucky it's so easy
thanks to collects last I don't think
it's in there tragically I think I've
just made a huge error and I'm going to
have to reorder the Oceaneer bikini top
but I did order another Beach essential
which is a really beautiful lightweight
white blouse so I went and lobby's I did
burn myself quite badly on the first
couple of days which meant I really
needed to cover my shoulders on my back
for the next three days
lesson learned it's SPF 50 every single
day even when it's cloudy from now on so
to that reason I thought I would pick up
a really beautiful lightweight blouse
from mango just in case I want to cover
up in the intense midday Sun this one is
such a beautiful style is like a linen
material with almost scratches through
the material making it even more rough
and raw and then you have these totally
raw frayed hems which just give it such
a chilled out kind of beach vibe I think
these are going to look so great over
the top of a bikini perhapses in denim
hot pants it even got the frayed hem
along the bottom as well
really like this and it's never going to
go out of style so this will be a beach
holiday essential for many holidays to
come I also picked up this little beach
trade suit because sometimes you just
want to really quickly put something on
overtop your swimming costume and to run
inside you're gonna get an ice cream or
something and this is one of those super
easy pieces it's just plain cream got
this nice edge along the bottom and then
also a scallop slate along the cross
over at the top adjustable straps and a
tie waist so you can make this as
flattering and a cinched in or it's bag
if you want it really up to you once
again just a beach essential perfect
just to stick in your suitcase and it's
one of those things that you just know
you're going to get tons of use out of
so I told you I got distracted when
looking for swimwear because I also
added this little beauty into my
shopping basket this is a cute little
pink shoulder bag it's got a pewter
chain strap tucked away inside and also
if you pocket this is surprisingly roomy
and this reminded me a little bit of the
Gucci style and I definitely do not need
to invest in any more designer handbags
over the next few weeks or months but I
thought I would shoot myself - this
affordable little number from mango I
adore the color I think it's very la
Beverly Hills type style and yeah really
practical have something that you can
wear crossbody it went on a holiday
so it's not that into my order as well
and then I saw this long dress and I
really felt that on the model in the
first on the website is look so much
like a faithful dress you know the brand
that just has the most amazing photos on
Instagram I thought this was very much
that vibe with the cold shoulder detail
you've got the ruffle at the top the
stripes make it really that kind of vibe
as well and then you've got a little bit
of a flare out at the hem as well this I
think will be just such a lovely chilled
out day dress over kini or you know Ryan
just out shopping that kind of thing
so another lovely addition to the
holiday wardrobe and then last but not
least I picked up this blouse which is
got this stretchy kind of not sure what
you call this type of material that's
where it's been sewn in a way that it
has major stretch off the shoulder white
blouse with fluted sleeves I picked this
up after watching Lydia's haul video
which she picked up a blouse like this
I've seen worse Victoria Beckham I
cannot fault anything in that whole
video but I saw this and it instantly
reminded me of it and is it so Beach
along the idea that I thought I would
pick up this one to see if I can kind of
recreate the look as fraction off the
price so this again I feel with denim
shorts jeans on slightly cool days a
really nice way to add a bit of designer
luxe to your wardrobe but without making
too much of a statement it's a really
subtle piece but tick's it so many trend
boxes with the ruffles the salute sleeve
and the author shoulder so fingers
crossed this looks as good as it did on
the website because yeah this could be a
really versatile piece so that's
everything that I picked up in my recent
collective horse and some of my pieces
and some really lovely holiday pieces
for my next trip so I really hope you
