our men's laners boat and we are just
about to head into town and grab a few
supplies a little bit to drink
for our journey today but we've
literally just got on our boat we can
show in the rooms we haven't met the
other guys yet they were showing the
boat with there's eight of us in total
today so looking forward to meeting
everyone but before they get here or
just quickly show you around the boat
before it gets a little bit crowded so
up here is that main deck or I think
we'll be spending most of our time kind
of chilling at sunbathing so got a
really big spacious deck up here and
then I think a lot of the sunbathing
will be going on over there which is the
end of our boat got the steering wheels
down there so we're just at the port it
split at the moment and yeah as I said
for setting sail soon and then down here
it really opens up into a big area so
here's the little kitchen area Charlie's
in our room unpacking how's it looking
chairs it's looking good looking good
I've got another little bedroom in there
here's our bathroom got a shower got a
sink got a mirror good and we got the
twin it is our skipper Adam say hello
I'm going and then we've got our big
table where we'll all have our dinner
later and then we've got another bedroom
down here this is under the bow of the
boat another bedroom in that room there
and a little bathroom so Charlie and I
are just going to quickly unpack and
then we're cut in the water
okay so I've just come to the front of
the boat we've just left the main harbor
in split and we're just talking to the
guys about our itinerary so as I
mentioned we are on a boat with med
sailors and that's a company that does
tours around Greece Turkey and Croatia
on these boats you can come with a group
of friends but on this trip it's just
Charlie and myself and we've got a
really lovely bunch of people on our
boat as well who you'll see in upcoming
clips but the itinerary is quite
flexible and I'm going to be using a
guide book from Marco Polo to kind of
decide on what we do want to get to each
of the islands so we know a few places
that were definitely going to be going
to on the Med sailors itinerary
including hvar split and if you've got a
cover member the names are but you'll
see very very soon and inside this book
it's got loads of tips on places that we
can go when we get to the islands so for
example there's a huge section on hvar
with restaurant suggestions and even
like really handy things like before I
came it was telling me about the plug
socket adapters it's a really practical
section in the back telling you things
like that and also the weather that it
should be this time of year and so far
it's got her pretty spot-on in fact it
actually says in the book that the best
way to explore the Croatian islands is
by island hopping on a boat so I think
we are definitely doing it the right way
around coming out here with men sailors
so the book also has this practicalities
section at the back here which tells you
the kind of things that you need whether
or not you need a visa travel insurance
driving license that kind of thing when
to go and what I found particularly
useful was also that it let us know what
kind of electricity they had here and
things you don't even think about like
how much tips to give in restaurants and
taxis so that's going to come in really
really handy they were going to be
making the most of the itinerary that
medicine
in essence saying my MA cappella but to
be a really really fun few days so we've
now come to an island called this which
is one of the closest islands to hvar it
was a little bit cloudy this morning but
we sailed from what's please do out this
morning Club yeah something like that
not a lot and video is about a three
hour boat ride even though the islands
look really really close together I
think I've been doing it miles an hour
yes it's exciting time yeah exactly
we're using the wind with me exactly
being being more real real real life
keepin it real and yeah we were sailing
for about three hours we did manage to
get a bit of a nap in the Sun and the
Sun has come out again now which is
wonderful and we are just exploring the
old town of there's Charley's had a
little dunk I'm just taking some photos
so we're just trying to catch up with a
gang now the rest of guys on our boat
and took smaller town
we have just pulled up to coach lat
which according to my little book is a
town which stands proudly on the
peninsula and it's Venetian rules make
it look like a miniature version of
Dubrovnik which is really good because
we're now actually visiting Dubrovnik on
this trip although having read lots
about it I think is definitely going to
be somewhere to add to our bucket list
so we're going to be heading it to the
old town which kind of sounds like the
best place to spend the rest of the
afternoon it says that there's lots of
areas for walking around the outer walls
you can have a really good view of the
sunset Peninsula so I think that's where
we're going to aim for and it's probably
going to take about 45 minutes and we're
going to get a bus there from our Little
Harbor one place that we're definitely
going to head into is the Massimo
cocktail bar which comes highly
recommended it says it's a really great
place for watching the sunset and having
an aperitif overlooking the sea walls
and there's also a little photo here
which makes it look as though it's on a
charming quite interesting they're going
to make that one of our destinations and
then spider my lovelies also
interestingly in color is the Marco Polo
house and of course this is the Marco
Polo but from deafening in a pair visit
to the market fellow house and that is
apparently the birthplace of the
Venetian traveler and you can climb to
top the top right here
you
good morning so we've just woken up in
our little cabins and we are in hvar
this morning so Adam woke up at about
half past five and was sailing the boat
from where we were last night - haha and
so it's nice that we've got to wake up
in a new destination today so I've been
doing a little bit of reading about hvar
and apparently it's one of the most
compelling of all the adriatic islands
so that's a good start
blessed with a mild climate covered in
vineyards and lavender fields so I think
there's gonna be quite a lot of
exploring to do here we have just pulled
up to the pack Eleni islands which in
the book it says an emerald green chain
of islands just off shore with lots of
pebble beaches so that's a really really
nice place for us to spend the day one
of the great things about the book is
that it has these little inside info
tips so things that maybe like a local
would tell you which is really handy
so for hvar it says that there's this
place called studio gosh starry grand
plane probably said that completely
wrong which is UNESCO World Heritage
Site and that is to the east of town and
there's some pebble beaches and coves
there which are much less developed and
I think we're quite near there
now so Charlie and I are just going to
have some breakfast and then we're going
to head here looking out for these
isolated beaches because that sounds
like the kind of place where we want to
spend our day
so our milk Kapono guide suggested that
the best way to arrive at Hawaii self
was by vote so we took the water taxi
from where we were moored up earlier to
a bar itself which is actually a
separate part of land to where we were
more doesn't spent the day today so we
just arrived and it's still that really
beautiful kind of evening light is
really looking very gorgeous and where
are we heading off to now darling um
it's difficult to pronounce surrogates
Vettel step tripping our oh I don't even
basically a Piazza which sounds very
nice Venetian style gas hence the Romans
in the back oh yeah Romans in Croatia so
let's go
but we were just making our way to the
piazza where hopefully we're going to
have some dinner and we came across this
lady who is making portraits of dogs
she's painting dog portraits and things
is Dixon's birthday next week we thought
we could have resist so we're just
trying to find a really nice photo I'm
going to get our little man we found a
lovely little restaurant down at the
side street and we're both feeling like
we're going to have a little bit of meat
for dinner tonight because we had
seafood and pasta and at lunch time and
I've been reading in my little guidebook
about what are good meals to have in
Croatia and it says that Croatians are
particularly good after a charcoal grill
to the day and Charlie and I both I've
seen dumb-looking steak that's what we
face it ordered so what's been your
favorite meal of the trip darling
probably a squid squid for lunch today
what's so nice about asses fresh you
don't get fresh squid all right yeah it
was awesome really nice I was reading
how it says that classic Dalmatian is
that right down Asian cuisine focuses on
plainly cooks fresh fish caught locally
in the Adriatic so yours is probably
cooked i'm Ditchley yeah yeah rational
russian village going straight down
young estates night so it's been a good
day for you lose the line good day for
the hour yeah but you're going which are
disappear
so we have had a really really lovely
dinner did you enjoy your steak
Downing's it was delicious and we now
have our Dexter painting a little boy
and my wife is so good at it I can't
believe how good so good this lady was
incredible and now we're about to meet
the rest of the guys for a couple of
drinks but we're just having a look down
a few of the local markets before
so today we are in Cygnus we departed
from her bar early this morning and we
spend the whole day sailing it's been a
really really nice day beautiful weather
and China has been sunbathing and above
all the boat down here and on the main
deck up there probably different about
what I was sailing we stop that now I go
to have some really nice lunch so it's
really quiet Cove I don't think it's in
any of the guidebooks that we've been
reading but we're going to stop here for
dinner
and stay the night here and at the
moment I've been with spending other
paddleboard out a bit of fun
good morning Thursday on our agenda we
are going to stare at which according to
my booklet is the largest sample
settlement on Hvar founded by Greek
settlers from Paris in the 4th century
BC and is basically the Old Town so it
should be really really beautiful going
to do a little bit wine-tasting and what
also thank you but also going to be
doing a packer which is a local kind of
Croatian barbecue with some lambs and
fish and I think it's pretty good it
takes about three hours to sail down so
we're setting sail now bright and early
we've had breakfast it's 32 degrees it
will read you it's only 9 o'clock in the
morning so I'm going to be a good day
you
you
okay so we've just stopped off for lunch
on one of the little coves on the island
of Hvar so we've reached the island
already but we've got another I'd say 40
minutes or so sailing until we get to
the place where we're actually stopping
for the evening but we found a gorgeous
little cove and we're just going to have
a little swim and we've stopped the boat
here to have some lunch but I really
quickly have to just tell you about the
most ridiculous thing that just happened
so I've been reading this book called
the secret and it's all about how if you
think positively about things and really
believe in the things that you're
thinking about the universe will somehow
make it happen and I'm always a tad
skeptical so I decided to put it to the
test in a way that the book recommended
so yesterday I thought I thought I'd
really really like to see some dolphins
on this trip today or tomorrow shopping
yesterday and the book said really
visualize it like imagine that's
actually happening so picture in your
head and really believe it and then let
the universe do its thing don't
visualize how it's going to happen just
believe that it will happen so I did
that I followed everything that the
books books said and about half an hour
ago I said to Charlie I don't think
anything negative just believe that this
is going to happen and then as you just
saw by the previous clip it happened so
we're all feeling very goose bump early
and fully believing that this book works
and I'm thinking I might actually do
like a video about not just this but you
know positivity and all that kind of
thing so let me know if that's something
that you'd want to see but anyway I'm
going to go paddleboarding and paddling
because we are absolutely roasting it's
about 32 degrees right now so I'll see
in a bit
but baby tonight we're beautiful now
the sky will open the class cuz baby
tonight we're beautiful now
beautiful don't you
you see the dark is
get your heart from China
so did mine
so it is our final evening with med
sailors Charley and I have one more
night here in Croatia
after tonight but it's our final evening
with med sailors so we pulled up into
the port of stari grad which is here on
hvar and a few hours ago and it had a
really nice afternoon exploring went to
the beach and did a bit more sunbathing
feeling quite bronzed now and the rest
of the gang have gone to a farm nearby
to do some wine tasting but China I'm
drinking too much at the moment though
way around you're awesome just staying
in the town no they're talking you're
not real good yeah so we're just staying
in the town tonight and we're currently
on the lookout for a restaurant and
somewhere to shoot some outfit photos
choice Instagram aren't you darling yes
yes we'll find some I love leeteuk
dinner and take some photos so let's go
my heart I'll be well through the dark
retard yo
farm
but there's a bride
Oh
so we have disembarked the boat and have
said goodbye to our gang it was a really
emotional goodbye actually spend five
days with these people and really get to
know everybody so it's quite sad saying
goodbye to everyone and sad saying
goodbye dad knows why he was such a good
skipper he was always so on the ball
leaving super early so you had those
time at seed just really sensible and a
really good laugh as well as if anyone
does med sailors and definitely requests
Adam as your skipper because honestly he
was so so so good miss you already Adam
but yeah it's the next day now we left
vote yesterday I didn't vlog yesterday
though he's also feeling too well I
think I got too much something I was
feeling a little bit heatstroke II I've
got a bit of a headache and like tummy
cramps it wasn't very nice to everyone
to vlog but we went into the gear which
is where we were staying got an
apartment for the last night had a nice
pizza and then had an early night as I
said I wasn't feeling too well but at
the airport now about to head back but
it's been such a good trip I'm really
really loved gracious so much more than
I thought I would and doing it with
medicine is such a great way of seeing
the islands I think we definitely did it
the right way around we want to come
back and do Dubrovnik I've read so much
in my book about how many amazing things
I've seen Dubrovnik and also in spit
itself because we are flying from
splitting bugs got to spend that much
time here so I'm going to be using my
marker fellow guide as a bit of a
checklist and hopefully come back to
Dubrovnik and split before too long but
yeah hope you guys enjoyed this vlog and
have enjoyed exploring Croatia with me
I'll see you on my next trip which is
very very soon so
