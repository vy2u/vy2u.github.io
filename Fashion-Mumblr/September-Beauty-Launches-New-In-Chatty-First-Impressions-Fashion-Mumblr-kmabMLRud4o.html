joining me for today's video which is
going to be my new in for September
video so you know the drill by now
basically at the beginning of every
month I'm going through a few of my
favorite product launches for this month
a few of which I have tried before and a
few of which I'm still yet to try so
this is a real war new in first
impressions type video so I've got quite
a few things to talk about this month
ranging from skincare to makeup to
perfume to hair products so I'm not
gonna ramble too much I'm just going to
get started first of all and probably
the launch though is most excited for
this month is the Victoria Beckham for
Estee Lauder beauty collection so this
collection is out now it's available in
Selfridges and what I love about this
collection is to be honest before I
heard about it I thought it was going to
be maybe quite hard to wear a little bit
too sharp for me but actually it's all
about looking not perfect but just raw
and sexy and I really really like that
it kind of makes a lot of these products
a lot easier to wear so I have very
kindly been sent three pieces and
holding that pre weirdly from the
collection first of all the morning aura
illuminating creme at least I think that
sort of is cuz it doesn't actually have
any wording on the packaging which is
absolutely beautiful I mean the
packaging is stunning you've got this
gold heated almost container
it just says V be very simple and sleek
at the top but there's no other
description on it whatsoever buy views
process of elimination to figure out
this is the morning aura so this is part
most riser part primer I used it at the
very beginning of my makeup routine this
morning I used one pump and just blended
that into my skin and instantly it did
give a really lovely very fresh morning
glow to my skin so definitely something
I can see myself using you autumn when
I'm not gonna be going on so many lovely
trips so my skin potentially might start
to go a little bit dull and I think I
would potentially be relying on this
it's made with I think it's crushed
pearls or pearl extract or something so
very luxurious as you can imagine it
from Victoria Beckham so this is going
to be 68 pounds which is not cheap but
actually Estee Lauder
look around Victoria Beckham herself
obviously a conclusion arias person at
least now that girl I just cannot even
explain how impressed I am with her
whole rebranding from posh spice to
someone that's collaborating with Estee
Lauder bringing out such an accrues make
at range and so yeah I think it does on
first impressions it does seem like a
very very good product so is it worth
the price tag at the moment I'm leaning
towards yes but as always keep an eye on
my blog for full on reviews after I've
got to know this product a little bit
more also within the collection I've
been sent an eye shadow again it doesn't
have any wording on it I'm not sure if
this is just press samples or if they
will be this simplistic in the shops as
well I've actually got a dark shimmering
one and personally I don't really wear
too many dark colors but I can imagine
Victoria Beckham would really wear a
beautiful black smoked out I I could
potentially use this with a very thin
brush and perhaps use it as a line ups
never really wear a lot of black on my
eyes it is very highly pigmented it
really does give a very bold of black
shade although I think it could be
blended out to create a little bit of a
lighter look shimmer wise it's not mega
sparkly if you compare it to for example
the Urban Decay mundos palette it
doesn't have as much Sparkle and glitter
to it but then I think that just makes
it look a little bit more classic in
packaging wise I've just got to say it
this is so similar to Tom Ford I have a
Tom Ford highlighter and in its
packaging which looks exactly like this
but then Estee Lauder owns Tom Ford as a
brand so maybe they just you know saved
a bomb or two on the production line but
yeah it looks so similar to Tom Ford
very high-end very serious and finally I
have a lipstick and this is probably my
favorite piece from the collection I've
tried so far from the free uhm but yeah
this is the lipstick in shade Brazilian
nude again very simple sleek packaging
black fluted is that the word fluted
pleated I don't know black kind of line
II did Melanie and our packaging and
this is a beautiful nude once again I
tried this this morning and I was really
impressed with firstly the
consistency of it it felt really
comfortable on my lips quite
moisturizing very quick and easy to do
so a good one to pop in the handbag
because it's not there very all-over
color it's quite quite sheer and yeah it
feels really comfortable looks very
natural very soft and feminine so I
think I'll be getting a lot of use out
of this one so I'm going to try it and
go in the order that I applied them on
my face this morning if I can remember
because I did put a lot of these on my
face for this makeup look here and
you'll be seeing little inserts so the
next thing that I'd use is the new Naked
skin color correcting fluid from Urban
Decay and I've never really been one and
that's very knowledgeable about color
correcting so I did have to google where
I should put this so I have got the
green and the yellow I think there are
four in total I think they also have a
pink and a lilac and but basically I'll
insert a photo here of the color wheel
and basically whatever your problem
color is to say you have a bit of purple
on your under eyes you then go to the
opposite color so if I remember
correctly purple the opposite I can see
at the moment was yellow in which case
you would use a yellow concealer
underneath your eyes as I did this
morning to counteract that purple so it
basically acts to balance the colors out
if you have any problems with redness
then I believe green is the color to go
for so if you have redness on your chin
perhaps this little area on your nose
then you can really balance that out
with these consistency wise I didn't
love them as much as I love the oven
Decay Naked concealer and I kind of was
expecting them to be a similar
consistency really creamy but I did find
them a tad harder to blend maybe that's
because of what I had on my skin prior
to this but they did do the job very
well I've really pleased with the color
correcting abilities of this yellow one
and yeah the green one works very well
as well so I am impressed with these and
these are out now as well then I applied
another product from urban decay and
this is their all nighter waterproofing
liquid foundation so I was a little bit
intimidated to try this because I'm not
a heavy coverage type of person I prefer
a BB cream something a little bit
lighter but I have to say for filming
and for a day that you do want a lot of
coverage and you want to look great all
day this is actually a really really
good one I've been wearing this
on those days when I know I'm going to
have photos taken if I'm doing outfit
shots or if I'm vlogging and I want my
skin to look good all day I have been
wearing this but I would say it is much
much too heavy for everyday wear if
you're not filming or taking photos
unless heavy coverage is a thing in
which case it's great but on the
negative side of things if you use your
facial expressions quite a lot
immediately after putting on your makeup
it does set in to your facial
expressions if that makes sense
and I actually noticed it on my chin so
obviously I applied it one day and I was
talking a lot and I got like a
semicircle around my chin where it had
creased which was very very strange so
then I applied a mist and blend it in a
bit more and it was okay but yeah it
does crease so that's one negative to
this one the next thing that I applied
of them bronzer and eyebrows was a new
blusher from Marc Jacobs and Marc Jacobs
has just launched in John Lewis so it's
now really really easy easier than ever
to get your hands on and I have to say I
really really love these blushes that I
was very kindly sent a selection of the
blushes I've got - I've got four I think
I may even have had five but I can only
see four at the moment so yeah I've got
the Marc shakers blushes for this makeup
look today I used number 504 which is
kink and kisses which I would have to
say is my favorite so far these are not
cheap by any stretch but I think they
are very very good flushers I like
packaging very sleek got the black on
the outside eyes you've got a mirror
inside the lid and then as you can see
there's a bit of a core agent going on
so if you like a very subtle natural
light blush you can swipe your brush on
this end or if you want something a
little bit deeper then you can use be
darker and or you can just swirl all
over if you want something in the middle
and consistency wise I love them the
color of this one I love it I think it
looks like a really girly feminine flush
it is matte and a powder so very easy to
apply and I was also kindly sent the
blush brush which is an angled blush a
brush with Marc Jacobs written on it on
this side and then you've got a silver
domes they're very luxurious makeup
brush and I just find that this applies
it really beautifully if it seems to
pick up
the perfect amount of product and I
would not hesitate to say that this is
going to be my new blusher combination
moving forward really really impressed
with these so I actually forgot to
mention this in the correct order
earlier but I did also use these a
Weaver concealer spectrum and inside you
can see a huge range of concealers which
I have mixed feelings about because
personally I would not have the use for
a lot of these shades and this is far
too dark for me I don't really ever feel
the need to use a pink can see level
that could be used for color correcting
but the couple of shades that I do use I
am very impressed with the formula is
creamy but not that blendable but it
feels nice on the skin and it is a very
skin-like texture so I was impressed
with the formula you've also got a
yellow which again can be used for color
correcting and lighter shades which you
can use under your eyes and really like
the packaging of this just the various
limbs are good for traveling I think if
you're a makeup artist for example this
would be a really good one to have
because it has got so many colors in it
but for me
maime just a few too many another thing
that I also used for today's look is
their contour spectrum so I just I love
zoeva palettes and I think they always
do really well at choosing good products
to put inside their palettes I probably
wouldn't have bought these separately
having the four thumb all together it
makes me a lot more likely to use this
palette so today I used this condo in
the bottom corner and while I'm not a
contour pro I was really really
impressed with it I found the color to
be slightly grey if that makes sense
don't if you can see here and quite a
quite quite a heavy contour for me I
don't normally do contour and definitely
not pro doing it so don't don't judge me
but I really like that it's slightly
more gray than orange or more gray than
brown because I think it looks a lot
more natural it looks like an actual
shadow as opposed to a strip of makeup
on your face so color wise really
impressed the highlight didn't really
highlight that much to be honest it was
very subtle but if subtle highlight is
your thing then that's a really really
good one for that I think if you wanted
to load up your brush a little bit more
you could probably put some underneath
your contour to really elevate
that sharp angle so one thing that I
have been really really loving this
month and you may have heard me talking
about it in some vlogs before is the
Hooda Beauty liquid matte lipstick so I
have got this shade bombshell and I'm
wearing it right now and I am obsessed I
love this color so much feel like it's
so me I love how long-lasting it is I
think if you compare it to the Kat Von
D's or the Anastasia it's not as
long-lasting but in return you get a lot
more comfort so I cannot feel this on my
lips at the moment which I love because
I don't like that slightly restricted
and sticky feeling not sticky but you
can definitely feel some that long
lasting liquid lipsticks whereas I
cannot feel this on my lips anymore it's
slightly chalky and consistency but at
the same time creamier than other long
lasting liquid lipsticks if that makes
sense it does have a fragrance which
potentially could be a bit of a love or
hate situation personally I don't mind
it it's coconutty it reminds me of a
similar bronze goddess in a nice way and
yeah very very impressed with these and
they're out now in Harrods so because I
wanted to add a little bit more
highlight to my face today I've used a
new product from Elizabeth Arden and
this is their beautiful color bold
illuminating liquid highlighter so you
get this beautiful little pops and it's
this kind of spongy pick it up
application inside which I don't really
get along with so instead I just dabbed
my fingers on the excess on the lid and
patted on and it is a very intense
highlight as you can see but I do like
that it's liquid so it's been blendable
and yeah I don't use highlight on a
regular basis but I do think that this
is very easy to use a very flattering
color which we're good on a lot of skin
tones so really like this new launch
from Elizabeth Arden also from their new
range which is called beautiful color
I've got a lipstick and an eyeliner so
the lipstick is called the beautiful
color bold liquid lipstick and is in
this spongy applicator twisted up to
reveal the color and this is a very
glossy color so an intense color but
still very shiny if that is what you're
into personally it's a little bit too
shiny for me but I think maybe when it
comes to more festive season and we are
getting a little bit more bold in our
makeup choices then maybe I'll start to
reach for this one but something else is
the liquid liner this is called the bold
defining 24-hour liquid eyeliner and I
think it's interesting that it has the
word bold in the title because I
wouldn't actually describe this as old
when I swatch it on my hand I thought it
was a little bit watery I did want the
color to be a bit more intense but
having said that I do really like how
this lips on the eye is slightly
shimmery so it catches the light and I
find the gold color really really
flattering but I wouldn't go so far as
to say that it's a bold color anyway
these are out now from Elizabeth Arden
the final product that I personally use
myself this morning is the L'Oreal LV
new root lifting dry shampoo and this is
from their fibre ology air collection
which does also include a shampoo and
conditioner which I also have here
however I have not tried these but it
does say they are volumizing and
thickening shampoo and conditioner
interestingly the conditioner is not
creamy which I've never seen before
but it says luxurious volume water after
wash lifted weightless roots maybe
because it's not cream that gives it
more of a weightless feel but I do trust
L'Oreal and they say weightless volume
because I just everything that they
claim in their other shampoos and
conditioners have worked well for me so
I have high hopes for these ones but yes
I did use this this morning I was really
really impressed actually looking at my
hand now I have brushed it and kind of
flattened it to create a center parting
so don't judge it based on my hand now I
think if you do not brush down your hair
then this would give you long lasting
volume I would say that as a dry shampoo
it's not the best my hair is on day 3
now and I know if I use batiste then it
really will look because I doesn't need
washing right as it still does feel a
little bit I don't if this is a real
word
my mum made up but it feels a little bit
cocky like I wonder how to describe it
but it feels basically quite heavy in
there still which I wouldn't expect from
a dry shampoo however when it comes to
volumizing and just getting your hair
off your head basically it does a really
good job not only in the top but also in
the ends so for day 3 hair I'm pretty
impressed with this volume next I wanted
to very quickly mention the origins
ritual tea face mask collection because
I am in love with them I know I already
talked about them on a vlog but these
are powder face masks that you mix up
yourself and you can choose to match up
along all rows I am obsessed with the
matcha one I also have the pot and spoon
which are sold separately but these are
out not sure when this videos going live
but these are gonna be out on September
the 9th and it's just so satisfying
mixing up your own face mask just really
spending those few moments to relax
blending yourself mix a little bit of
water equal parts there's just something
really fun and satisfying about doing
that
and also when I use this last left my
skin really just refreshed and really
glowing in lovely so really loved this
launch and wanted to include it even I
have spoken about it before next I
wanted to mention a skin care launch
from Kiehl's and this is their nightly
refining micro peel concentrate so this
is an anti-aging product which is aimed
at regenerating skin while we sleep so
if I take it out you can see this is
what it looks like you've got the
pipette and the bottle and this is a
gentle peel so that what that means is
it basically helps your skin skin cells
to regenerate a swith cell turnover
which in the long run and in short some
actually really helps to improve the
skin texture so if your skin is dry or
you've got any other bumps that this
will really really help and generally
just leaves your skin looking and
feeling softer and it gives you a lovely
glow so again something which will come
in really handy in the autumn and winter
months because we all need that glow the
product contains quinoa husks which I
don't believe any other skin care
contains and the reason why they have
chosen to include the quinoa husks is
because they've been found to help with
exfoliation now I can't really calm
on how that works in long term I can say
that I'm uses last night I was impressed
with how soft my skin was this morning
but as always with skincare keep an eye
on my blog and you'll be hearing about
this in a few weeks time if I think that
it is worthy and I really get along with
it so definitely keep an eye on my blog
because from first impressions I think I
will be getting a lot of use out of this
and yeah first impressions are good but
stick around to see how I get along with
this one so next is something really
unusual and different and it is a facial
dry brushing set from evader and a vida
is a brand that I really love I love
what they stand for and this collection
is inspired by ancient diabetic rituals
which is facial dry brushing so it's
known to promote skin cell turnover and
also aid with exfoliation but also Aveda
want you to really focus on the process
itself so just spending a little bit of
extra time on your skincare routine and
really enjoying the process so these two
together form the two lisara skin carrot
ritual and you get the brush and the oil
the oil is made up of six plant oils
naturally derived as you'd expect from a
Veda and this is the brush it has these
dimples on the top there a really funny
texture I'll show a close-up here of the
brush and really lovely soft bristles so
what you do is you just brush your face
when your face is completely clean and
dry and this really aids with
circulation gets everything moving and
flowing and then you massage in the oil
afterwards this is not something I have
tried yet it only arrived this morning
but something that I love the sound of
so I will let you know how I get along
with this and the set is available now
from a Vedas sparse and online and
salons etc etc next is a really lovely
one and this is a charitable
collaboration between L'Occitane and
Marie Claire when I first read it I
thought it was Marie Curie because I
thought it was quite random sweet
collaborator in Marie Claire but they
have done and solo
Tan and Roper have brought out Laflamme
I hope I'm saying that right time
presume it's French and Laflamme and
this is a candle within which a hundred
percent of the profit now that is
amazing is going to go to charities
which help educating women so I'm just
going to read off the press three still
don't want to get any of this
information wrong but it says that a
hundred percent of the profits from the
sale of each candle will be donated to
three chosen charities which are planned
International UK for Sierra Leone and
Uganda as well as toots a Nicole from
Hobby Moon in Cambodia and entrepreneurs
demand which is helping women in Africa
in order to transform the lives of
thousands of young girls in developing
countries the candle itself comes in
this beautiful pink tin and scent wise
it is very fresh uplifting I really
can't put my finger on it it feels quite
citrusy and but a really lovely and very
powerful scent very powerful that is for
sure
for L'Occitane which is of course a
luxurious brand it's only eight pounds
so I feel like there's just no excuse
not to buy this candle with all the
profits going to charity and you can
reuse the tin as well you can put cotton
buds in it or something but a really
lovely fragrance cannot wait to burn
this and just such a great cause so
having spoken briefly about the Loreal
dry shampoo earlier there's also a new
nod from batiste which I wanted to
mention because I would say batiste is
my favorite dry shampoo brand for making
your hand last longer between washes
which at the moment for me is very
important because our heating is broken
so we only have cold showers which I
hate so this is their new launch and
it's their dry shampoo natural and light
bear so if you love dry shampoo but you
sometimes don't want that full of almost
chalky look in your hair
personally I quite like it gets rid of
my roots and then this one is probably
for you so it's a lighter formula of
their well known and loved and trusted
dry shampoo so it has all the benefits
of the normal dry shampoo the fragrances
lighter the consistency is lighter I
will in fact put in a little bit now
actually that is a really lovely
consistency and having run my hands
through my hair it's actually a lot
lighter you know sometimes when you
apply dry shampoo it can feel quite hard
to run your hands through your hair that
smell is so nice oh my gosh really fresh
but definitely not as strong as the
previous ones so this is out now from
batiste finally I wanted to give a shout
out to a fragrance because this is one
that I absolutely love and it is the
wise sell black opium but this is the
wild edition so it's actually in a
smaller bottle than the one I currently
have smaller than my black opium now I'm
afraid I don't know if that's because
I've just got some smaller bottle or
more if it comes in a smaller bottle and
the whole probably the former option but
how cool is this packaging it still got
the lovely black Sparkle that we know
and love from black opium but in a kind
of leopard eat I get not leopard and a
tiger print so very wild as for the name
scent wise I don't actually think the
scent has changed it's still the black
opium that I absolutely adore this is
definitely one of my favorite wintry
autumnal fragrances it's so warming it's
so just like cozy and comforting to wear
and yet so luxurious at the same time
whether this is the standard bottle size
or just smaller than my normal black
opium I love this size of bottle it's
still very slim line so good for
traveling lighter than the previous size
that I had and still got incredible
fragrance so I thought I would quickly
mention this one at the end because
loved it so that is everything from my
