channel today's video is going to be my
September favorites and I'm having to
hold my little sausage because a few of
my favorite spot fashion pieces and no
matter where I put them down he insists
on making his bed fair so until I've
showed you the fashion bits this little
chap is gonna stay on my lap so this
month as you may know if you've been
watching any of my vlogs or snapchat has
been fairly ridiculous on the busy scale
it was Fashion Week and I also went to
Amsterdam went to Greece went to Germany
so quite a few trips as well so fair to
say that September was quite a manic
month and normally when I have really
busy months I have less favourites
because I tend to stick to what I know
and but actually this month I bought
some really lovely pieces and there are
a few really amazing launches so
actually it's a fairly good favourites
video so so if I can get this little
chat off my nap I'm gonna get straight
in there started with my fashion
favorites my first fashion favorite is
actually gonna be fairly hard to show
you so I'll insert the photo of either
me wearing it or it on the model here so
that you can see what it looks like
properly but it's as lovely white or
cream chunky knit jumper from Club
Monaco and I absolutely love the sleeves
because it's got this triple ruffle
detail it was actually the sleeves that
made me walk into the store and start my
shopping session I saw it on the
mannequin and I was like that has to be
mine it's just so perfect for the
upcoming at cooler months I actually
love knitwear I can't stand being cold
in fact I wear a thermal under the most
things about of them on under this top
and I thought we could definitely get
away with wearing a thermal and sneeze
this one it wasn't cheap by any stretch
but I thought for a Club Monaco jumper I
will get so much use out of it so this
was a bit of an investment piece and I'm
sure you'll be seeing me wearing this a
lot in the upcoming months it's really
lovely thick material it's just so warm
and snuggly and I feel like it's quite
flattering as well and on trend with a
ruffle detail so really really been
enjoying wearing this I've worn it a
couple of times so far and get so many
compliments whenever I wear it so that's
my first favorite of September I'll get
all the fashion
favorites out the way and then we can
get on to Beauty etc and I'm not
actually sure if I featured these in
last month's favorites so apologies if I
did but I'm still totally obsessed with
them these are my river island meals or
um slip-on slipper mules and they are
obviously eeeh tubes of the Gucci meals
I don't care I just absolutely love them
in fact I prefer them to the Gucci ones
and they were definitely a lot cheaper
these I think are 55 pounds if I
remember correctly but they were limited
edition I will leave a link below if I
can find it but if not I'll just leave a
link to the river island mule page
because they have so many gorgeous ones
at the moment I actually have three
pairs of river island mules that I've
picked up this month so these I've been
wearing a lot they look really lovely
with jeans that have had the bottoms
kind of cut quite roughly and I've been
wearing them an awful lot so definitely
a favorite of September and another
favorite which I'm sure you will not be
surprised to see is my gorgeous new
Valentino rocks Ted handbag so as you
may know I also have a coral and orange
and pink and white um Valentino handbag
and Valentino's definitely my kind of go
to around when I want to treat myself
and this one in this dark gold almost
pewter color it's just so gorgeous for
autumn I've already got tons of wear out
of it it's got a really long strap so I
can put it over my shoulder like a
crossbody bag it's really secure and it
tends to fit everything I need in there
so I can get my phone a little bit of
makeup a purse and my vlogging camera so
while it is a lovely small handbag it
still fits in everything that I need it
to and this one was from far fetch again
I'll leave a link down below and it
doesn't obviously you love it everyone
it's so much and I can see this being a
real classic in my wardrobe next I have
a hair favorite and if you follow my
blog fashion manga calm you'll have seen
that I devoted an entire post to these
because I just love them so much and
they are the new GHD platinum stylist in
copper so I went to the launch event for
this it was in
my trip to Devon and my trip to Germany
so it's quite a whirlwind for me I
didn't really get much sleep because at
the Rose wouldn't it's such a fabulous
event and they were launching their
copper collection which is out now I
will leave my blog post about the copper
collection down below if you'd like more
information but basically these are the
Platinum stylers and I've been using
them pretty much every day creating big
curls with them and because of the
tri-zone technology within the GHD
platinum you really don't damage your
hair they go up to the optimum
temperature of 195 degrees which is the
perfect temperature to not damage your
hair but still get the style that you
want so I've been loving the ease I
already love THD platinum and now that
they're in copper I just I couldn't love
them any more speaking of essential this
is a very new favorite in fact I've only
owned it for five days most of those
days have been actually October but I
couldn't do my September favorites
without mentioning the new Olympus PEN
EPL eight so if you have been watching
blocked over you will know that I was
recently in Greece for the launch of
this camera and it is the bloggers
favorite camera there are so many
reasons why I'm obsessed with his camera
and I picked up the EPL eight in the
brown color which I just think is so
unusual really retro and very glamorous
looking and it definitely goes with my
Instagram grid which tragically was a
serious consideration but I want you
guys to let me know what you would like
to know about this so would you like me
to your blog post on the differences
between this and the APR seven or would
you like a video just giving me more
information about it just let me know
and also I have to tell you that this
camera is not actually released yet but
I do have a link where I have 15 cameras
available for you to get before it comes
out which actually is quite a big deal
because they always sell out because
they're so in demand so I'll leave that
link down below if you want to be one of
the first to get your hands on this and
it really is such a fabulous camera it's
the essential bloggers camera with the
drop down screen interchangeable lenses
I take most of my blog photos on this
with the 45 or the 75 ml lens and also
for vlogging
it's just fabulous because of this
selfie screen so yeah let me know what
you would like to know about this camera
and your wish is my command
another favorite for me this month and
something which I wasn't really
expecting to be a favorite because you
know I'm
the healthiest of people is the Madeline
Shaw Ready Steady glow recipe book so I
met Madeline and practiced one of her
recipes with her at the Soho farmhouse
with origins at the beginning of the
month beginning of last month and since
then I as you can see her books marked a
ton of the recipes if you watched my
what I eat in a day video leave that
link down below I basically cooked for
the whole day it based him based on
recipes from this book I would say a few
of my favorites are her pancakes which
are of course
healthy pancakes and the life-changing
tomato soup that was actually the most
amazing tomato soup I've ever tasted and
now that we're getting a lot of colder
outside you just want to have something
heartwarming so I'll be cooking that a
lot more and yeah there's just tons of
recipes in here some of them are a
little bit more naughty like there's a
vegan chocolate brownie but most of them
are really healthy and nutritious and
I've really been enjoying going to the
farmers market which is on the Clapham
and then streets me in my house I've
been enjoying going there on the
weekends I'm picking up lots of organic
produce so yeah I'd say that this has
kind of helped me shift my the way that
I look at food and helped me to realize
I do actually like healthy food so thank
you Madeline for bringing a little bit
more health into my life and then I have
one more favorite before I move on to
beauty and I don't have tons of Beauty
just a few key things but before I
mention beauty this last one it is just
trying to eat inside out it this bikini
which I picked up from net-a-porter and
the brand is called Marysia
very easier and a ry si a and I have
never been that confident with my bikini
body I've not got a bad body but you
know I don't think anyone's truly happy
with their body in a bikini but this is
the closest I have ever got the top is
kind of like a little crop top with this
gorgeous scalloped detail and the
scalloped detail kind of attracts the
eye where it should go as opposed to
areas you people that you maybe don't on
the eye to be attracted to and because
I'm fairly flat-chested to this top just
seems to be really flattering and not
make me look like a little boy in a
bikinis there are some top and the
bottoms are high-waisted
personally I feel so much more confident
in high-waisted bottoms because it
covers the lower part of my tummy which
is the area though I'm mostly not happy
with so by covering that I'm kind of
love handle area I just feel so so so
much better by the pool by the beach and
yeah this was a very expensive bikini
but I thought I would rather spend I'm
not even gonna say how much is because
it's just I can't bring myself to say it
out loud but I know and I thought I'd
rather spend one lump sum on a bikini
die
absolutely adore instead of spending
tons on bikinis that I'm not gonna like
in a little while I thought this is
black it's classic it's good quality so
this is going to be my bikini of choice
from now on and lastly we are on to
beauty and I have three main things that
I've been loving this month two are from
the same brand and that is Shaun Sakaki
and I've always loved Shaun Takai but I
kind of didn't really buy anything from
them for about a year I went through a
bit of a lull of just didn't forget
about them but I didn't explore them any
further so recently when I went into the
counter in Harvey Nicks I picked up a
couple of pieces which are now daily
essentials for me the first one is there
HD perfecting face powder in bronze and
I already owned the clear one and I used
to use that as a normal powder and this
is pretty much the same it gives a
really beautiful almost an airbrushed
kind of a soft light finish and of
course mattifies but it is slightly heat
bronze so a really lovely way to add
some warmth to your complexion as well
and of course I do need regular
mattifying top-up so this is just a
really lovely way of mattifying and
adding warmth to your face while on a go
and then also from the brand is there
lipstick this is officially called the
lipstick in the shade my Raja and what I
find really important for lipstick
shopping in autumn winter is that
they're reading moisturizing so I do
tend to get quite dry lips
well this consistency wise is almost a
balm it's so lovely and moisturizing on
the lips and the color is just dreamy
it's a beautiful brownie pink surprise
surprise I don't think I've worn and
usually haven't been brownie pink on my
lips for almost a year now but it's a
little bit more feminine and girly than
your usual brownie pink but it's a
formula that I'm totally in love with
I'm wearing it right now it has a soft
Sheen but not shiny if
makes sense so it's basically my perfect
formula and my perfect color so I've
been wearing this a lot and it would
definitely be repurchasing once I
finished that which considering I've
been using it Wow
considering I've been using it like
every day multiple times a day I'm
impressed us so much that flies expects
me to be a little stumped so hopefully
for a little while left off this one and
my final favorite is one which I
discovered at the beginning of the month
as well at an incredible event by the
body shop and is then used for of the
world Brazilian okay this is where I
need your help with pronunciation cap
watchu or cap whistle see coop coop
watch you watch room I think it's
Brazilian nuts yeah Brazilian cool pour
watch ooh scrub in oil so this is a body
scrub I apply it in the shower but it's
a really lovely oily formula which means
that your skin feels moisturized just as
soon as you apply it which is great
especially when it starts to get colder
because your skin does try it out
especially if you exfoliate so this just
combats at that straight away I love the
smell for one it's very exotic it's kind
of oh it's almost good enough to eat
it's got this definite definite sweet
smell to it but it really does remind me
of holidays and anything that reminds me
holidays is definitely a good thing also
love the packaging it's ginormous this
is for me hundred and fifty grams so
absolutely gianormous tub of body scrub
but more than anything else I love how
it works because it's got such small
granules I believe they're salt
yeah poured over fine salt crystals so
because they're so fine they really do
scrub your body they don't you know just
massage it a little bit they really do
scrub away the dead skin so it's
incredibly effective don't really have a
negative thing to say about this that
whole spar of the world range is really
impressing me at the moment and I would
definitely again be repurchasing this I
probably got another 2 uses out of this
and then I'll be done and yes definitely
going on my shopping list once it is or
and up so those are the products I have
been loving throughout the month of
tambour I'd love to know what your
favorite products have been this month

any favorites or if you love any of
