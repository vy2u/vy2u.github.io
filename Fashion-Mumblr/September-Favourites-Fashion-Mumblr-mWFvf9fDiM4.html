or at least long time since I sat in
front of the camera and spoke to you
guys think the last time that we had a
little chat like this was my August
favorites which obviously was a month
ago and I think I filmed it about five
weeks ago because that one was on time
this September favorites there's a
little bit late because I have been so
busy recently I have obviously been
uploading videos but they have been more
vlog type videos so I did the London
Fashion Week vlogs I did day one day two
and day three and then I did my its leaf
logs straight after fashion week I went
to Italy so that was probably a favorite
my little trip to Italy was really
lovely we stayed at than the fae hotel
which I've written all about on the blog
if you want to see what I got up to and
professional week I also filmed to get
ready with me so again it wasn't a
sitting in front of the camera and
talking video so yeah it's been a while
apologies if I'm a bit rusty also I'm
trying out a new camera position so let
me know if you guys like it
I think the lighting works a little bit
better speaking of which I forgot to
turn my light on so now it's on
hopefully I'll be a little bit brighter
but yeah I look quite white and clinical
but anyway rambling aside let's talk
about my favorite things of September
firstly I think I mentioned this in last
month's favorites but still this lovely
it's Swarovski necklace I've been
wearing it all the time it's just this
very dainty triangle diamond D type
necklace and it just goes with
everything it's really lovely I think
I've got it upside down now but yeah I
mentioned in my last favorites I would
ramble on but it's been another favorite
this month and I've been wearing it all
the time so seeing as I was talking
about the necklace let's start with a
few fashion items and firstly there's
this juillet which is from Dorothy
Perkins I don't think it's in the sale
at the moment and because it's quite new
I know Dorothy Perkins have just
launched their sale as have a lot of
retailers so I might do like a sale
roundup blog post but this juillet was
29 pounds which i think is just
ridiculous and it's so silky soft it's
absolutely gorgeous and it's got kind of
like a suede e but it's not real suede
Brown on the outside and
luckily it's not sheepskin with just a
lovely thick fur obviously not even
thirst it's like a lovey it's soft
lining it also comes in a light pink
color which I also have because 29
pounds please just look really gorgeous
whether it's over a roll neck or over a
jumper and they're so snuggly and it's
hard to show you with it flat but when
it's on it has a lovely waterfall detail
along the front here on the lapels so
it's absolutely gorgeous
I'm 429 pounds I just think it's
incredible Dorothy Perkins I will leave
a link below to it on the website if you
want to grab yourself one which I highly
it recommends and I'm sure they'll sell
out so don't be slow and then another
outerwear piece and I wore this during
Fashion Week and it was my favorite
outfit of Fashion Week it's this long
trench coat from Oasis and it's very
light material so it's really good for
this time of year when we're having a
surprisingly surprisingly warm October
and it's sunny but you just don't want
to be too bare limbed so because it's so
long really hard to show you on camera
but I mean look how much I'm scrolling
yeah that's how long it is really long
so it's quite covering but because of
the thin material it's not too you know
not too hot and it's got a tight
waistband so it can be really lovely and
flattering and I rolled up the sleeves
during Fashion Week because the sleeves
are quite long but I thought they looked
better as 3/4 sleeves and then it's got
the buckles on the sleeves so you can
just kind of pull it tight and fastened
sleeves in place I'll link the outfit
post down below that I wore this in
because it was definitely as I said my
favorite outfit of Fashion Week then we
have a super cozy snuggly feat in a
cloud product which is definitely a
favorite and is these gorgeous
slippers from EMU I saw that Victoria
also featured these in her favorites and
actually I wasn't going to feature them
because I kind of you know that slippers
but then I saw what hers and I thought
they are a favorite of mine as well so
yeah these are from EMU I got the purple
emo kind of brownie color and my feet
after Fashion Week were you know not on
not the best but I've been wearing these
around the house and that fur is just so
squishy it literally is like your feet
are surrounded in marshmallow cocooned
clouds they are amazing and they've got
very nice
soles so sometimes when I'm taking
Dexter outside like with non-normal
slippers I would take them off with
these because they're quite chunky soles
I do wear them around the patio and
they're lovely quality so I think these
will be lasting me for several winters
to come I always want to keep on my
hands because they're so cozy like
little gloves but yeah absolutely
love these and the final norm UT
products of doing it strange way around
doing PT at the end but it's this
backpack backpack backpack from Radley
and if you've been following my blog or
Instagram you'll probably be it's hired
of seeing this backpack because I've
featured it so many times but it is so
handy I mean I've never actually really
owned a backpack before I've always
thought that wasn't really cool enough
for them but I have been finding this
the handiest thing in the whole world
especially during Fashion Week when
you've got your show invite in one hand
you've got your phone you've got your
camera and you need to have a hundred
arms but with this I just flung it on my
back and it was so convenient plus it's
a really lovely squishy gray leather so
it always looks quite relaxed it's not
like one of those geeky backpacks are
really kind of alert on your back you
know I mean it's just a lovely texture
it fastens with this little buckle which
you can see there and then it's full of
when I crap at the moment but it's got
an inside zipper pockets and a couple
and if you can see them a couple of like
fabric pockets as well it's kind of a
bit like Mary Poppins handbag fits
everything in and it's been really
having my shoulders because normally my
shoulders ache quite a lot from carrying
one bag on one side obviously with this
distributes the weight evenly and it's
also got pocket on the back which I keep
my credit card in which I use a micro SD
card so it's really easy to not have to
let go leaning around to get your card
out put your phone in there as well but
it's probably not the safest place so
yeah this has been an unexpected
favorite of September okay so onto
beauty products there have been a couple
of tanning products which I've been
really loving this month I think it's
because now that summer is definitely
over and I don't want to say goodbye to
my summer tan I've been really amping up
my fake tanning routine so what I've
been using first off is this VG Liberata
fabulous tan I've never used anything
from them other than their phenomena
to three weeks time which I absolutely
love so I've actually picked up the
wrong one for my favorites this is the
self-tanning gradual lotion but what I
meant to include in my favourites is
their non gradual their humble it's
called their tanning lotion in the shade
dark because it gives the most
incredible time at the very first time
you've used it so you don't need to do
loads of applications are used it before
the intern premiere and you guys might
already see my get ready with me video
if not I'll link it down below but it
just gives the most fluid list natural
coloring natural colored tan that
genuinely genuinely does not smell so
fitti Liberata fabulous tan I think it's
a lot cheaper than the phenomenal talent
so definitely give that a try and to top
it up I've been using the Dove donor spa
summer revived you guys might have tried
before the doves some body glow or
summer summer glow I think it's called
the one in the cream strange-shaped tube
but this is the new launched version of
that new in for autumn and it's part of
their dermis par range so they've spent
years and years researching the skincare
can they put everything they learnt into
this product I much prefer the packaging
with this to the previous one the summer
version because I found it really hard
to get the last few bits out of that one
whereas with this because it's a squishy
tube you can just really get every
single bit out it has got a bit of a
smell unlike the Vita Liberata but this
is amazing for just keeping a tan top
tip regularly and not having to do a
full on body tag I've been using this
maybe every other day and absolutely
love it for maintaining a real or fake
tan skin care wise my two favorites have
been from Estee Lauder this month I
finally got to try the advanced night
repair I first discovered this in their
pop-up store in box park in Shoreditch
and she used on my skin obviously not
about not before I was about to go to
bed but before she applied makeup and it
just gave my skin such a gorgeous glow
but also felt really soft and my skin
just felt finally like it had the
ingredients that it wanted and it really
just drank everything in and I've been
loving using this in the evening along
with the advanced night repair eye cream
this is quite pricy for the size that it
is however only been using the tiny
tiniest little amounts just underneath
the eye bone on the actual bone not on
the
my bags like I used to do and then all
the way up to the brow bone and I've
really been noticing a huge difference
in the actual puffiness of my eye bags I
think in previous videos I've been
complaining about having double eye bags
like a bag within a bag but I have been
noticing it so badly since using this
and I've been drinking more water so the
two combined has been a favorite
combination this month this is the
russet spiced nail varnish from the H&amp;amp;M
Beauty range you guys might be thinking
oh you didn't feature that in your H&amp;amp;M
haul and that's because I got this at
the hmm pop-up launch in the Truman
brewery a couple of days ago and I've
been absolutely loving the color of this
so not necessarily a September favorite
but a recent favorite which I had to
include though it's a gorgeous shade for
autumn it's a rusty kind of orange and
it's not I'm wearing it right now and
it's not really shimmery but it's
definitely not like a plain matte color
I'm just gonna insert a little quiz for
my nails here and as I said in my haul
video I've been really impressed with
the formula of the H M nail varnishes
there's so cheap so affordable have a
really really good color range and they
last a really long time on the nails
I've been really liking this one in
particular also the makeup revolution of
London have a ultra blush palette which
I have been using on an everyday basis
ever since I got it and it has how many
eight different blush shades
it says blush but I've actually been
using these more as highlights I've got
it one today and it's gives it gives a
subtle color but also a bit of highlight
as well so I think these are absolutely
incredible for drugstore products I've
actually been reaching for this over my
shoulder Tillery highlighter and over my
more expensive blushes it's time for the
toy for dexter he's playing with them
right now I've been using this one in
particular and also the more brownie one
depending on the kind of look that I've
been going for today I'm actually
wearing this one which is more purple
because I combined it with the H&amp;amp;M
purple blush but they really remind me
of the hourglass ambient lighting
powders because ambient lighting blush
sorry because of the almost marbled
shimmery but not a glittery effect that
they give it doesn't give quite as much
for glow as the ambient light blusher
and but more of a highlight I'd say and
again for the price ginormous mirror in
the lid you get all of these different
and whoever finishes a blusher anyway so
it doesn't matter that they're small so
this is the ultra blush palette in
golden sugar by makeup revolution if you
don't have one of these and you like a
nice highlight II shimmery but not
shimmery just glowy blush god I'm
starving take my words out and I
definitely recommend you pick up one of
these on the more expensive side of the
scale I've been loving the Estee Lauder
lip potion in particular this one which
is a shade extreme nude I'm wearing it
right now and it's almost like a brownie
pink it's definitely a lip stain but it
has more of a color than most lip stain
so it's it's got quite a matte finish
but not not completely matte it's kind
of an in the middle product between a
balm and a lipstick but it has a lovely
dopher applicator so it's really easy to
apply I love that you can see the color
inside the tube and the packaging I also
have a gorgeous bright red but I'm
saving that till more of a festive time
packaging overall absolutely beautiful
it's like a deep navy with a gold lid
similar to the kendall Jenner lipsticks
and all the lipsticks in that range this
color though just absolutely perfect for
everyday autumn if you guys know me
you'll know that I love the brandy pink
shades so extremely nude has been the
one that I've been reaching for almost
every day this month I don't want to
rush through these last ones I'm getting
conscious at the time so I'm not going
to spend too long chatting about them
our next favorite is the eyes are the
window shade palette from Stila is it
still little Stila I'm not sure but
firstly the packaging it's got a
gorgeous rose gold lid and then a normal
coat gold back and look inside literally
every single brown eyeshadow and even
pinky Browns gray Browns just all the
eyeshadows that one could ever need
during autumn winter spring summer and
gorgeous huge lid in the mirror mirror
in the lid so the packaging gorgeous
actual eyeshadow shades gorgeous
obviously they're not the biggest again
I never really finished eyes shadows and
I have just been choosing from this one
here which is the kind of pinky matte
Brown as well as a shimmery Brown very
light brown actually just all of them I
haven't
use many of the darker shades yeah but I
definitely will too and this is
available in Marks and Spencers which i
think is incredible I did not realize
M&amp;amp;S had brands like this but their
beauty section has hugely expanded
recently and this I just I cannot I
don't think I've ever felt such passion
towards an eyeshadow palette like the
Apple yes I love the Naked 3 and you
guys know I do I love all the colors
inside it but this outside huge mirror
inside just absolutely love it and last
but not least we have a couple of brow
products from Urban Decay suddenly my
eye of horus eyebrow pencil which I
normally used ran out but I found an
exact pretty much version of it from
Urban Decay this is called their brow
beat a pencil microphone brow pencil and
brush so as you can guess by the name it
has a brush on one end and a roller brow
pencil on the other and for me these are
the perfect thing for my brows because
my brows are rubbish and I just need to
use something very light and fine to
fill in the gaps and then shape the
hairs basically I have not many brow
hairs but the hairs that I do have a
really long so I need to tame them with
this end and fill in any gaps with this
end so and the color that I have is warm
brown which is great for me it's like a
light blondie brown color and I've been
setting the brows in place and just
maintaining them what's the word yeah
taming them using the Urban Decay brow
tamer perfectly named and again I've got
the tinted color I think it comes an
unscented as well the blonde is bigger
than the benefits gimme brow which I
found a little bit harder to use to
begin with because I was used to the
absolutely tiny one in gimme brow
however I'd say this is less pigmented
than gimme brow so you don't end up
getting it all over your face like I
sometimes do with the bourgeois one
again the color is absolutely perfect
and it really sets the brows in place
but without them looking or feeling
crispy which for me is an absolute
winner so the two together have been the
brow combination that I've been loving
throughout September and so that's it
I've got through all the little goodies
on my bed these have all been products
which I have genuinely loved so much
throughout the month of September it
seems like quite a random selection
looking at the products in front of me
but that's because I just went around
the house and pick up the pieces that
genuinely I absolutely have loved
using love putting on my face loved
wearing so it's a really I really love
all of these pieces that's what I'm
trying to say so we're in October now in
