vlog I'm starting today's vlog from my
living room we are in the royal suite at
the Savoy Hotel today and I'm pinching
myself I was expecting us to be in one
of their average rooms which let's face
it are still spectacular but we have
kindly been allowed to shoot in their
Royal Suite today which I'm so excited
about because today is the day we are
shooting for De Beers diamonds and I'm
so excited it's going to be such a great
experience so I don't know if you just
saw but um the butler I think he was
just came in and that's quite mortifying
it came out of nowhere
because when Kat and I got here we
caught because it was so excited and we
ran around like crazy oh my god I need
he didn't come from the entrance he came
from the other side is he hiding in the
wardrobe or one one on house and not act
cool in the most amazing hotel room and
so I'm gonna give you a hotel room tour
very quickly before we start shooting
because this is the best hotel room I
have ever seen in London and the view oh
my goodness so we have got the London
Eye over there I can see the houses of
parliament right opposite me as the
Royal Festival Hall I can see like the
city I can see not the Gherkin and the
one that looks like a pregnant belly I'm
not sure it's called but anyway I'm
gonna flip the camera around and give
you the hotel room tour to end all the
hotel room doors so this is the entrance
area you have two doors not just one
that's when you know the room is gonna
be snazzy and then I think this is just
like a little welcoming area a little
table a mini wardrobe and then probably
like toilets and staff this is the main
area Kat is busy snapping away just got
a text user from April yes I can see it
on my watch this movie this is
the living-room area complete with
gorgeous fireplace incredible views
don't mind our stuff and littering up
everywhere and then you have the second
half of living room beautiful
flat-screen TV incredible chandeliers
amazing view and then you have your own
little bar area bar kitchen cocktail
glasses sweets of course lots of treats
there and then at the lovely gentleman
who we do not know where he appeared
from and how its provided us with some
tea which I'm definitely going to dig
into in a second
bar area with lots of different alcohol
you've got the head of whiskey star of
Bombay grey goose my favorite what else
do we have
oh look at this place look at this oh my
goodness have you ever seen anything so
spectacular but it does not in there you
may have noticed I've not showed you a
bed yet that's because we have another
room here this is kind of like a little
boardroom area another bar Wow where did
that guy come from we have a little mini
kitchen with an espresso machine look at
this look at this I'm so speechless guys
it keeps going this is the bathroom cat
is busy snapping away hello I live here
oh my goodness look at this so stunning
Wow and then doesn't end there more down
here Wow well we were this oh my
goodness this is the walk-in wardrobe oh
my gosh you'd have to be staying here
for a long time to fill this all up with
you
oh my god there's like ah another door
that's where he came from thank God
that is where the helpers come in I
think this looks like it's aspinall I
could jewelry box or something
yeah it's Aspinall god that's incredible
and then last but not least the most
important part of any bedroom of a
bedroom
look at this Wow
we are so lucky to be able to shoot you
here today oh my gosh
time to get snapping with all the
lighting goes so that is my little room
tour of the Royal Suite here at the
Savoy I'm feeling very very grateful for
them to allow us to shoot here so mr.
security man with the Diamonds is
arriving in 50 minutes so we have a
little bit of time to shoot before that
I think we're just going to shoot some
nice Instagram photos and things like
that so I'll catch up with you a little
bit later okay so we have shot a few
photos in the beautiful bathroom area
and we shot a few in the beautiful
living room area my hat is looking
rather voluminous today I had a blow-dry
first thing at and I've never been there
before the Sassoon salon in Covent
Garden and they used a Weller treatment
it was the liquid hair treatment which I
have had done before I was saying how
because my hair is obviously ultra
coloured and gets very very dry I said
what can you do to help the condition of
my hair and the I think is called liquid
hair or liquid silk I'm not sure I will
use the exact name of it down below but
you leave it on the hair for 15 minutes
after shampoo and it leaves it so shiny
and nourishing it should last a couple
of weeks so hair's looking good thanks
to that making the most of it by doing
lots of snaps we are now going to change
into outfit number three and mr.
security chaps should be here any second
to deliver on diamonds are you nervous
I'm gonna cry yes oh my gosh we need to
figure out exactly how much all these
diamonds are worth a lot of money this
is the outfit that I have just shot it
is a needle and thread dress and I
really like the kind of Prairie girl
vibes really really cute new Valentino
shoes and a my usual
accessories okay so we have the DeBeers
pieces on I have gone for two different
necklaces one's a little short one and
then we've got two beautiful pendants
but what I love the most is this ring
cluster so I've got three rings on my
right hand and this beautiful bracelet
these are from their Lotus collection so
we are gonna get snapping
for three shooting and I've just
switched up my ring this is the Aria
diamonds ring this is the most expensive
piece that we are shooting Charlie and
April have just arrived and we're giving
them the ground so it's all pretty
impressed it has been a long day of
shooting Chas Millar and I are now in a
cap on our way home and we're going away
in two days so tonight we're gonna do a
little bit of packing I'm gonna go down
to dawdle so I will do a blogger mail
unboxing for you when I get back home
but today has been amazing I have been
trying it to create loads of content
that I can share while we're away I
obviously I'm gonna be putting our blog
post and YouTube videos well abroad but
I wanted to get to be all scheduled and
done so I don't have to worry about it
getting the ready things today
yeah I will catch up with you when we
are back home okay so we've just got
home from doddle and I'm going to do a
little bit of blog mail and boxing this
first one is from Linda Farah which is a
very luxurious sunglasses company I
mentioned in a bit of a newsletter that
I do that we are going to the Maldives
the day after tomorrow
so a few brands have kindly sent over
some pieces I've not tried this friend's
sunglasses before so let's have a little
look we have two pairs they are both
very big and bold firstly oh my goodness
but how I know them as they are this is
gonna totally ridiculous my hair in a
button but imagine me with like beachy
waves of this style bonkers have you let
my hair down maybe I look a bit better
yeah super glamorous so I'll be taking
these with me to the Maldives
what do you think love those I love
round sunglasses you've got such a cute
like retro 65 and then these are more of
like a cat eye design in this blush
colored acrylic I find cat eye usually
suits my face the best yes big fan of
those as well that is amazing so thank
you very much - Linda furrow for sending
me those my holiday then I have a
ginormous box and it says it's from Tom
Ford and beauty which is incredible what
is insert oh my goodness it's another
one of these epic boxes I've got a white
one of these weeks ago how amazing is
this what is inside it says on the side
the eyes of Tom Ford oh my goodness oh
my goodness holy moly gracious oh my
lord I have no words
I have no
that is spectacular what are these they
look like looks like a spike it I think
each of these about individual
eyeshadows but it's written like
different photography elements you've
got exposure photographic warm
leatherette which is a filter
temperature this is some shrinking I
think we've got four different mascaras
here and all in the signature
beautifully luxurious tomforde packaging
I wonder if they're all different colors
is definitely a black mascara stunning
this is the spike mascara so maybe these
are three different lash types this is a
more kind of solid bristled brush with
separating out the lashes that's my
favorite kind of brush whereas the
previous one was quite fibery
and then this one is called full screen
lash and we have gotten even more
brittle brush so I'm guessing that's
gonna be the most dramatic of the lashes
that's intriguing this isn't a gloss so
shiny eyelids has been a big trend this
autumn winter Tom would have just the
product to achieve it looks just like a
lip gloss obviously a lip gloss and be
really gross and sticky on your eyes
take that with me on holiday to try and
rock the eye gloss trend I can't imagine
how that would feel on your eyelids
surely really gross and sticky but if
Tom Ford of doing it there definitely
won't be gross we have three eyeliners I
think there's a beautiful brown I
definitely always go for a brown
eyeliner over a black front like a
little bit harsh this is the eye Kohl
intense in oh one espresso which sounds
like a beautiful shade perfect dark
brown that will be part of my daily
makeup and then I'm so intrigued by all
these boxes I think they are so this
looks like a mini of the Tom Ford like
highlight palettes powder palettes if I
show you what the big palettes look like
this is one of my big Tom Ford palettes
with the eyeshadows in their eyeshadow
court they look like this and this
little mini one is literally a tiny
version and inside are individual Tom
Ford eyeshadows this one is called warm
leatherette as probably my ideal shade
is like a brownie
gold-color can you see that oh my
goodness beautiful and so satisfying to
open and close these black onyx we have
I'm guessing is gonna be a black shade
that it's like black with blue shimmer
in there oh my gosh the most perfect
like champagne e color that is so
stunning and of course they all have the
TF emblazoned in there how adorable oh
my goodness this is the most amazing
delivery I think I have ever received
wow wow wow
so I'm gonna just have a look through
all of these different eye shadows
choose my favorites oh my gosh this is
gonna look so amazing all stacked up
it's gonna look like a tower of Tom Ford
gold that's so beautiful
right I'm gonna put that aside to take
some Instagram story for that in a few
moments this next delivery I had to
unbox at Dajjal because the box was so
ginormous how amazing is this this is
from L'Occitane and it is obviously a
giant hot air balloon this is hollow and
then in the basket are a few of the
essential L'Occitane pieces and little
minis which is perfect timing I think
this is their divine cream which is a
lovely face moisturizer and then this I
believe looks like their lavender bath
oil yes foaming bath another of my
favorite products a mini of that hairdo
Lumiere perfume and also I think this is
our almond shower oil oh my goodness
all of my favorite products in a hotter
bloom this is the kind of thing I'm like
what on earth do I do with this now
obviously it's an incredible gift I
think I'm gonna give this to my brother
who he and his wife expecting another
baby soon and how gorgeous is that to
hang in a nursery so so beautiful and
with the press release has said if I
tweet or Instagram a picture of this
then they will donate 25 pounds to the
locks turn charitable foundation or a
charity of my choice so I definitely
need to get some lovely snaps of this
one so that they make a donation on my
behalf which is very very generous of
them at this time of year in 2006
L'Occitane created its own charitable
foundation to pioneer English
that will improve every community in
which we operate with an annual budget
of over a million euros the L'Occitane
Foundation has two main fields of action
to support the blind and partially
sighted people worldwide on the economic
emancipation of women in developing
countries your 25-pound will go towards
further supporting these initiatives we
thank you for your continued support
this year and look forward to working
with you in 2018 that's a lovely message
from the lock stamp er girls I will
cherish that and then we have one more
blogger male I have not got a clue this
is from who is this from cotys celebrity
fragrance hipsters look at that this box
is totally crazy Wow oh my gosh it looks
like we have gift sets from various
celebrity fragrances we've got Katy
Perry this is her indie gift set with a
body lotion natural spray and shower gel
which looks like this if you know any
Katy Perry fans this would be a lovely
little stocking filler I did not even
know that Katy Perry had a perfume
apparently she doesn't it's called
ending who knew that's a really really
cool gift set such a nice stocking
filler oh and they've even put in some
wrapping paper this is very the log
friendly wrapping paper we've got some
marble some black marble and even some
pink marble this looks like my dining
table downstairs it's such a good idea
and I think I might keep some of this
the gold tinsel for wrapping as well the
next things that were in my pure box are
things that I have ordered myself I have
an a sauce order and a Topshop order so
I'll quickly show you what I got from
those two retail
holiday stuff so I just whispered really
quickly first up is something cozy from
a so this is like a really lovely ribbed
material and which I think will be very
very flattering I thought this
asymmetric shape was pretty cool as well
I'm probably gonna be wearing more
causes and bikinis just because it is
the time of year and we like to eat
comfort food and I just feel more
confident in a swing cozy especially if
you're like snorkeling and scuba diving
so I picked up that one to start with
that is so random this is a Topshop
place it do they have Topshop on ASOS or
my going mad here no I'm going mad I
just opened up my Topshop water duh
black and white something cozy is from
Topshop not a sauce oh my god it's too
late and I need a coffee so yeah I
ordered this beach place suit because
that is the kind of thing that I will
live in when I'm in the Maldives
you'll be seeing all these pieces on my
Instagram before too long
another swimming Kazi this one's quite
hard to show you without it being on but
it's got this beautiful ruffle detail on
this v-neck line so it should be really
lovely on it looks kind of strange off
but you've got this crisscross detail a
really nice low back so good for turning
and quite a statement piece I noticed
that everything in my suitcase so far is
white so I wanted to get some slightly
more bold designs and my last piece is
something else that's white it is a
giant beach shirt dress so when you're
in roll these you just don't really want
to wear much clothing at all you don't
want too much fabric on your body
because it's so warm and anything you do
want on your skin it needs to be
SuperDuper lightweight so I thought this
would be absolutely perfect it's got
almost like a square pattern on the
fabric I'm not sure if you can see that
it looks quite linen E and but I think
it is cotton and then it's got a waist
belt so it should be quite flattering as
well a nice length too I will literally
just be popping that own on over a
swimming costume with some sandals for
most days going to the restaurant before
lunch and then we have the ASOS order
not the Topshop order let me find my
scissors no white stuff so this is part
of a little cord set we have these
little shorts with a ruffle kind of
paper bag high waist and then
this is the matching top it's basically
just a really cute bando ruffle top so
nothing to covering again the kind of
thing that you wouldn't really wear
anything other than in the Maldives so I
will wait until I'm super Brown to wear
that lovely little set and last but not
least another lovely beach cover-up this
one has beautiful long sleeves with this
really nice kind of lacy embroidery
detail down the bottom there and then
it's quite a boho style you've got this
tie around the waistline that hopefully
will cinch it in and make it really nice
shape it's definitely quite pirate style
with this material but that's the kind
of vibe I like to go for on a holiday so
that is my blogger mail for today I
actually think I'm gonna end the vlog
here I know I've only really showed you
photoshoot in the Savoy and unboxing but
now I'm just gonna go and pack a little
bit to do a little bit of work chai is
gonna cook so I hope you don't mind that
today's one has been a little bit
shorter um or shall I
