vlog further day four
so today started off with a really
lovely breakfast event at a restaurant
called Bronte and it was to celebrate my
friend Kelly she has launched a jewelry
collection and it is honestly the most
worthy collection I think I've ever
heard of so she was the charity that a
hundred percent of the profits going to
go towards its charity called for
rangers which is in collaboration with
tusk all their work is going toward
helping Rangers who spend their lives
doing the very dangerous job of
protecting the elephants through working
against poachers and Kelly showed us a
video and I actually started crying at a
table it was so emotional and the whole
point was the elephants are being killed
completely unnecessarily for their horns
for their skeletons and basically 90
elephants every single day are killed
which is one every 15 minutes and if
this rate of killing continues they're
not going to be scary needed for the
whole world's ecosystem it's a really
emotional video I'll leave a link to it
down below if you're interested so Kelly
is from a blog called London chapter
that's her blog and Kelly grew up in
Kenya and her whole childhood was spent
around elephants so she's very
passionate about the protection of
elephants as we all should be and so
Kelly has teamed up with a
husband-and-wife team who've got a
jewelry company called all eight and
they've created some really beautiful
incredibly wearable designs which I
showed you a clip off earlier and they
start from around 50 pounds and 100% of
the profits of this jewelry will going
to be four Rangers charities they're
really really good cause this is hard
key to stopping them starting because
people are looking at me like I'm crazy
so
really lovely start to the day I'm gonna
leave a lot more information in the
description box and also a link to the
jewelry because it's such a lovely
presence as well you're not only giving
someone a really beautiful piece of
jewelry but also giving them a donation
so I know a lot of my friends and family
are going to be getting these bracelets
for Christmas today I am just in town
this morning for a few meetings I've
actually missed an event because I
stayed at the breakfast for so long but
my next meeting is in central somewhere
I need to check my emails to remind
myself where it is
since Nona finds a little cafe with some
Wi-Fi get a little bit of work done Oh a
nice tile is what on the table they said
we could keep them so these are
definitely going to be my blog
photography props for tomorrow so I
found myself walking down the main
shopping street here in Covent Garden
and the conference is going into a
couple of shops I've already picked up a
few nice little terminal pieces from and
also nipson to Marks &amp;amp; Spencer to get my
annual film pool so I'll show you what I
picked up when I get home
next into the nip into Zara because
really want to get a few more classic
pairs of jeans mostly ones I can just
chop the bottom off because we all know
that that star these days so next up is
Zara
okay things just got a little bit spendy
in All Saints it's got a lovely jumper I
will show you when I got home when I get
home but I just wanted to share with you
a random London fact that I got from Jay
who's the Olympus photographer so this
style of Boulard behind me I always I
never really thought about the shaver
done but did you know they are bat
shaped because the original Bowl ads
were cannons with a cannon ball in the
top of them and now they are just
redesigned to still look that way so
there's your random London for the day
back home again now and since I last saw
you I had a cup of meetings so I can
really lock in my meetings exactly a bit
weird I met with the PR girl for Monica
vinegar which is really nice because
obviously I wear their stuff all the
time and she gave me a little bangle as
well this top one if you can see it the
top one there which is just so lovely I
will give him close up in a second and
then I met the lovely Beth from Birchbox
so just got home now and by the way
excuse my top I'm wearing my thermal I
just had my film on and my jumper so
yeah I thought I'd quickly show you my
little goodie bags and what I picked up
in town so see I took you shopping with
me a little bit in Covent Garden first
store that I went into was cars and yeah
I just went in next a few people had
recently said that it was having a good
season so um so wrapped up in this
tissue paper so let's have a little look
the first thing is this jumper and
obviously is a coming up to autumn I
thought I would grab a jumper and this
is a nice long-sleeve gray high neck so
I'll be able to fit my thermal on
underneath that and is really nice color
with the gray and white stripes cause is
not the cheapest this was 69 pounds so
fairly pricey but I thought I would
probably a lot of use out of that and
then I also saw this top I was really
attracted to the detail on the hems so
the sleeves have got light as pleated
material it's obviously been kind of
ironed into this position and then
obviously it's definitely my color with
this dusky pink and the same pleating at
the bottom so they're both from cause I
thought they were really lovely by the
way if anyone is wondering about my
handbag that is a really old mulberry
bag so when I used to work at mulberry I
got this my staff discount and it's
called the cecily design and yeah really
cute nice good big bag for autumn then
in Zara
I showed you trying on a little things
in the fitting rooms for shoes I
they were just too big even the size 36
which is such a shame because I
definitely would have got them if they
are my size but I did get some genes
which is what I went in for I wanted to
get some really classic ones without too
many rips but with a jagged hem so I've
got these ones that I ripped myself no I
didn't rip them myself that I cut myself
and yeah just thought I would get some
really nice fit and sarra jeans in the
size 34 fit me really well so I'm really
pleased with those then I went in to All
Saints this is the one that you saw me
trying on in the mirror really lovely
jumper there we go yeah I'm pretty much
just stocking up for autumn at the
moment and I really liked this color it
was fairly pricey it's a hundred percent
merino wool which means it's going to be
really nice and warm and just beautiful
color beautiful fit and once again a
nice high neckline so I can put lots of
layers underneath it so that's a really
gorgeous one and then most excitingly I
went into Marks &amp;amp; Spencer because yeah I
do wear thermals under everything so I
picked up a few more thermals really
exciting stuff so I got the short sleeve
vest which hopefully is cropped not
completely short in gray and black and
then I did get another one I'll show you
that in a second
here we go so I got some thermal
leggings because I don't like having
cold legs and one more thermal yeah this
is a round neck long-sleeve shirt so
pretty much the same style as the one
I'm wearing now but in quite a classic
gray and I also from M&amp;amp;S got a new
dressing-gown and I know it's not that
really lovely super soft material but
actually this quite looks like a piece
of outerwear a coat I'll just put it on
and show you in the mirror
so here we go I know dressing gowns are
not the sexiest of things but I thought
this actually looks a bit like a coat
like it looks like outerwear but it is a
really lovely snuggly warm dressing-gown
and it's this brushed fabric so it's
gonna be really cozy nice and long
because when I'm at home I just want to
be cozy and warm and I want to be able
to chuck something on
/ what I'm wearing and just be snuggly I
can feel right now that it's just really
really warm and cozy it actually looks a
little bit like a river island coat that
I've got I don't know if you remember
the gray one that used to wear all the
time last year it reminds me a little
bit of that so I got this I definitely
needed a new dressing-gown because every
time I wear one lots Dexter decides that
he wants to shred it and he rips kind of
holes in the sleeves so um
there he is autumn naughty boy have to
play with his daddy yet tell them how
tell you does it so that's what I picked
up in moccasins fen so I'm gonna have to
take this on for the night mixes so
boiling so that's all my shopping and
I'll quickly show you what I bought
so the bed is looking a little bit messy
now I need to tidy up um but yeah I had
a meeting with Birchbox and she very
kindly gave me this thermal flask which
is so handy because I like to take like
a can multi or you know herb will tea
out with me because it's such a ripoff
if you buy them in like Starbucks so
yeah that's gonna come in really really
handy and this is bando which they stock
on the birch box shop so that's why she
very kindly gave me that one absolutely
love that and then she also popped in
something I've not tried before this is
the triple performing facial emotion
from benefits you're really good in
winter because it just has I think it
exfoliates hydrates protects some
comforts to skin and it's an oil-free
moisturizer once again on the birch box
shop online I'll leave that link in the
description box down here and finally
another autumn winter essential this is
the doctor lip nipple balm craziest name
ever but basically you can use as a lip
balm or for dry ankles or dry knees or I
get really dry like here between my
thumb and my finger weirdly so this is
just gonna be such a good multitasker
for autumn and then finally of course my
bracelets this one I obviously can't
point to it but the stiff one that's not
a chain that's the one that the lady
from Monica vinegar kindly gave me I
have salutely love it the one above it I
just wear old-time and then the other
two as you saw this morning they are
from Kelly's collaboration it's called
the Tembo
action and I explained that to you
earlier just such an amazing cause as I
said I'm going to leave much more
information about that down below I'll
probably write a blog post about it but
that may be a little bit longer until
that's done there were really lovely
morning lots of good shopping bits and
lots of really lovely events and
meetings now I'm back home I got a
little bit of work to do and I need to
charge my camera battery so I'm gonna
sign out for an hour or so and then I'll
chat with you guys once I've done a bit
of work need to edit couple of videos do
some emails and yeah or fun stuff that
comes with being a blogger so I'll catch
you a little bit later alrighty it's a
little bit later on now it's probably
about seven o'clock just spend a couple
of hours doing emails and things and
Charlie and I went down to dawdle and
there's tons of stuff got like a load of
bags down here I've got some bags on the
bed so I think tomorrow's vlog tober
might be a blogger mail unboxing so let
me know if you'd like to see that there
are some pretty big packages so yeah
that might be quite exciting um I have
got some food in the oven now we are
being pretty lazy with our food this
evening actually Charlie's been really
healthy Chinese got salmon salad but I
have got Marks and Spencers Chinese a
lot of sweet and sour chicken and a
quarter dark and pancakes which is done
and my chickens in the oven so I'm just
gonna get all of that ready and got my
hair crazy a day and eat all that while
watching Great British Bake Off
we've been joined
Oh guys that food was so tasty
just let the doctor ordered I always
love a good Chinese meal whether from
M&amp;amp;S or from her take Cory down the road
and I've just published yesterday's
video a little bit later than normal
because as you may know it was a brand
video a collaboration with it's my
second video in fact with this big boots
project that I've been working on and we
just wanted to come upstairs and just
have a chat with you about sponsored
content and about ads because the
interesting for me to know your heels
and also just I feel like it's something
I've never be talked about so now is the
time I guess so yeah as you probably
know and I'm pretty sure you guys know
this I'm full-time blogger on youtuber
so working with brands is how I make
money so obviously YouTube and build
content and Instagram content is
completely free for you guys to watch
like it's entirely free it's not like
you have to pay a subscription and
sometimes when you have something free
you have to put up with your dad every
now and then like Spotify or iPlayer you
know you just have to have the old ad if
we now and then and pretty much I'll
just cut up on my foot bleeding
anyway completely lost my train of
thought um yeah okay so obviously by
doing oh I can see the blood dripping
down my leg not going to look it up by
doing these collaborations of brands
that's how I make money like that's how
I can afford to be a youtuber and other
full-time and that's how I can afford to
continue making these videos which you
guys get to see for free so yeah I'm
pretty sure you guys understand that um
which is wonderful and you are really
what your understanding and nothing you
get it when it comes to choosing what
brands I work with I think so so so
carefully because I don't want to work
with any old brand I want to make sure
they're firstly it's something I truly
believe in I will never work with around
no much no matter how much money is on
the table if I don't know the product if
I don't know the service and if I don't
think you guys gonna love it like that
is my number
one priority so for example with the
boots video and that went live this
evening or for Nia watching this
yesterday
boots approached me and they said look
we're doing this really cool thing and
stored in the boots of Emporium and we
think the Eagle viewers would love to
find out about it and they told me what
it's gonna be all about and I said yeah
actually that is a really cool service
and that is something that I think you
guys would love to know about so I said
yes so that's just an example of a
recent one that um and why I decided to
do that collaboration because I will
always be more likely to accept
something if I think that you guys are
going to be interested in then if it was
like I don't know cigarettes I don't
want to be advertising that I don't know
if you guys were interested in that so I
would say no to that kind of thing even
if they said look here's 20,000 pounds
to promote this cigarette butt but god
that was really yorkshire um so yeah
just know that any ads on my channel are
always things that I love myself
services that I genuinely use and things
and I think you guys would be interested
in so yeah I just thought I would have
that little chat with you guys and let
you know how I stand on the whole
sponsored content and ads situation
hopefully you feel that when I do work
with a brand is really authentic and
fits and naturally
can you hear Charlie and Dexter perhaps
I'm charging around the living room
I gave Dexter a little bit of my duck
I've tried finished it and it's made him
really really hyper so that's can you
hear that oh my god those boys are
totally crazy um so yeah I keep getting
distracted but yeah hopefully you feel
like what I'm bringing you whether it's
paid for or not is genuine authentic
content and thank you for just always
being supportive and you guys are so
understanding like I'm really lucky that
you're a very intelligent audience like
you are totally understanding of what I
do and then yes I have to do ads every
now and then to make their money
otherwise I'd have to go back to my old
job and I won't be able to make videos
for you so yeah all this free content
comes with your dad every now and then
and so far you guys are totally cool
with that so thank you very very much
for being
so amazing and understanding and you
have my promise that everything that I
ever do on this channel will be stuff
that I truly believe in that I am either
a user of or a fan of or you know a
product that I genuinely think that you
guys will be interested in so you have
that pinky promise from me so the rest
of this evening I am going to get a
shower I'm gonna put a mask on my hair
I'm gonna use a toning mass because
we're going a little bit yellow so I
need to get some purple shampoo on and I
might leave the other Plex in overnight
I think that would be quite a good one
for me and then I'm gonna go to bed so I
think I will end this vlog here if you
just really conscious I'm getting blood
on the bed cheese if you guys have any
questions about sponsor content or ads
or just anything in general then let me
know in the comments below because yeah
I think it should be an open discussion
I'm not trying to hide anything from you
guys so let me know if you got any
questions and I'll be very happy to
answer them and as always thank you for
your support and from being the best
viewers and subscribers ever like I love
you guys to pieces or so you're so
intelligent and you're so kind and
switched on and Dexter's just coming to
the room to say hello to his mummy
really hello puppy hello puppy dog I've
got my puppy here with me now he's
totally hyper anyway that is all from me
thank you guys so much for watching
