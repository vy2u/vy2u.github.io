well I mean feeling much better than I
am today I'm afraid this is a genuine
sickbay routine videos I'm not been
feeling too good recently so I start the
day with loads of flu medicine starting
with some LM sip I find this just helps
to clear everything out then I have a
big glass of water from my filter and
it's good to keep hydrated throughout
the day when you're ill and also if you
can have some vitamins in home and
reduce maybe I find that really helps
then I'm taking some tablets these are
the scenes breeze cold and flu ones they
worked really well and much cheaper
lemsip version then I run myself a bath
and I'm using some West lab epsom salts
because I find these are really good
just relieving any aching muscles
everything tends to ache when I'm ill so
these are really nice I don't have a
smell so I add some calm one calm old
from soaking glory to make it more
bubbly even though I can't really smell
the earth or water because my nose is
blocked then I clean my face using the
pixie and face wipes
I love these ones because they're really
soft and they stay really moisturize
thanks to be closure on the packet and I
just clean my face my nose is so red
from all the blowing then it's into the
bath I get look at those tan lines and
I'm using the sensory sparse butter
facial cleanser because it's so soft and
it just feels lovely and pampering and
gentle my skin rinsing that off with
some water and then I'm washing my hair
I'm using the Loreal mythic oil range
just because it means that my hair is
really easy to detangle really soft and
I don't need to spend ages brushing it
afterwards I'm using the mask from the
same range afterwards all through the
ends and then I'm just going to brush
that through
so I tie my hair into a bit of a loose
bun while I relax in the bath and then
I'm going to be using some urban Veda
products because they're all-natural
skincare and I just like to be natural
when I'm not feeling very well
this one is scrub and it leaves my skin
feeling really tingly and it has a mint
smell and it's one of the only smells
that I can actually smell I'm using the
same brands body lotion this is just
really lovely in gentle sinks and really
quickly as well but still really lovely
and luxurious then it's into my dressing
gown I just want to be super comfy today
we of course my lovely little EMU
slippers then because I don't really
like that whole sickroom why I'm making
it smell nice with a molten brown room
spray my just spritz it's all over I
find it helps make the room feel a
little bit less stuffy and then I'm
lighting my neon Happiness candle I
can't smell it but anybody coming into
the room countin so it's nice to make
the room a little bit a little bit more
atmospheric and I'm also using a Neal's
Yard Room fragrance drops in this
contraption which Charlie is obsessed
with and I'm towel drying my hair and
putting in some new parole from Palmer's
again this means that I can just run
through my hair with a hairbrush or
tangle teezer really really easily
so I am going to do a little bit of
skincare and makeup just my usual
routine trying to hide my dressing gown
sleeves that I which Dexter is chilled
this is my lab Prairie serum which I use
pretty much every day at the moment no
point in changing your serum and then my
usual is Earl at super skin eye cream as
well I'm also using some eye drops from
Rio true because my eyes are a little
bit itchy and then the make a difference
moisturizer from origins it's actually a
gel moisturizer because my skin's a
little bit warm now I'm using a cream
from meals yard I actually picked up the
wrong one it's meant to be a soothing
cream putting it on my nose and and then
a little bit of makeup just to make me
feel a bit more human starting with the
Clarins BB cream I'm just using a zoeva
brush a really big one to blend that in
really quick and easy and some bronzer
to add some life back into my face this
is the Estee Lauder bronze goddess again
this is just to make me look half alive
I'm not going to leave the house today
then to attempt to hide those massive
puffy eyes I'm using the l'oreal true
match concealer and blending it in fancy
of my fingers and then the spectrum
blending sponge which i got in this
month's Birchbox I really like that
flawless finish and then of course I'm
going to do my brows using the Mac brow
pencil and benefit gimme brow again this
is just purely so that when I look in
the mirror or answer the door doing it
like a complete zombie
on my eyelids I'm using a neutral shade
from the Urban Decay Gwen Stefani
palette and then I'm also using a
lighter shade just in the corners of my
eyes and this helps to make them look a
little bit brighter makes me look a
little bit more awake even if I don't
feel it
finally my normal mascara just one layer
of the Rimmel volume colorist this is
just a mascara I use on an everyday
basis sometimes I layer it up but not
today I just want to look more awake and
then this stuff the Elizabeth Arden
eight hour cream lip balm is my Savior I
apply this several times throughout the
day I love it right lips always get so
dry when I'm poorly so I'm putting on
loads of this stuff
then it's back into the bedroom all of
my energy has been used up by doing my
makeup so opening the window to make
some fresh air come into the room onto
my laptop checking my email mountain
isn't overflowing probably sticking on
some Netflix then I spot that dexter's
come in so I give him some cuddles I
definitely recommend puppy cuddles if
you're poorly it always helps I'm also
reading a book just to try and fall
asleep really sleeping always helps on
you're ill no puppy kisses and I'm
pretty much just going to kiss texture
for the rest of the day now I'm going to
have a nap hopefully I'll feel better
when I wake up you guys enjoyed this
video and if you're feeling poorly then
I hope you feel better soon see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
