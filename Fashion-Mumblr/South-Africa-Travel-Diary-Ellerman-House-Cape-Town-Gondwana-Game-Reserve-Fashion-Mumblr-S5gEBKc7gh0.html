vlog we are here in element house in
Cape Town were only here for a couple of
nights unfortunately but we have already
fallen in love with this place it's so
beautiful
I'll give you a little tour of the hotel
we've just spent the day by the pool
just relaxing I had an absolutely
incredible spa treatment down at their
spa this morning I went for the mummy Oh
massage which I didn't realize is
actually pregnant ladies but it was
really really lovely had a bit of
exfoliation a hot stone massage an oil
massage so that was absolutely gorgeous
it's about half six now so Charlie and I
are just heading down to see the sunset
I would give you a room tour of our room
but I actually because we've already
been here a night it's a little bit
messy so I'm just gonna really quickly
show you around this room which is the
room next door to ours very similar to
ours but slightly different decker but
have a look at this it's so beautiful so
you've got a huge incredibly comfortable
bed well I'm guessing it's as comfy as
ours anyway and then a beautiful
downstairs living area down these little
steps a huge wardrobe with all the bits
and bobs you need inside and then this
is the bathroom
huge double sink bathroom and this
beautiful downstairs area little
dressing table and balcony look at that
beer
we found that lovely little table out on
the terrace here at element house and
which is having a lovely glass of wine
that's watch the sunset but quickly I'm
going to show you this view because it's
on another level so the Sun is about to
set over there it should come about here
you should be able to see it there's the
beautiful house that's our room over
there and then I get up
and then that is Cape Town and then
we've got beautiful pool area and where
we are lounging earlier on we had lunch
on that Terrace which was lovely
so it's a little bit later on now it's
about eight o'clock in the evening
and unfortunately Joey is not feeling
too good so I'm gonna have to knit in
the room so that at least I can be with
chard every want to eat on my own I have
to say the service of this hotel is
absolutely incredible nothing is too
much of an issue it's just literally
like being in your own home feel so
comfortable here and they very kindly
bought the dinner up to the room
including the candle the flower those on
the table the bread everything so I've
ordered from the daily menu they have a
new menu every single day using fresh
ingredients and I have gone for a little
look so I've gone for lamb belly for my
starter which is just a nice little
tasty dish to get things started the
bread as well got some orange juice a
wine over there and then I've gone for
pea and ricotta tortellini with grilled
asparagus for my main course which looks
absolutely delicious I'm gonna sit down
and have my meal now and I will see you
guys in the morning
good morning is there we left a
beautiful a tenement house this morning
else breakfast coming to started driving
and when taking the garden roads which
is a really scenic drive along the coast
the nominee s you know I'm so just
driving through kind of mountainous
region at the moment
and so that's from a subtle late
we have made it to our eco 10th here in
Gondwana and this is not what I was
expecting at all this is absolutely
incredible we are in a tents in the
middle of the wilderness we've driven
about 25 minutes on a dirt track in a
Land Rover to get here no electricity
obviously no Wi-Fi so it's gonna be a
bit of a digital detox for me but this
place is just quite literally in the
middle of the wilderness the guy just
said that there could be elephants just
strolling past we saw Buffalo it seemed
zebra let me show you our tents we have
our little deck here and our view Wow
look at this this is our tent a nice
double bed with me and Charlie I've got
some drinks here storage area and then
this is our adorable little bathroom how
fabulous is this oh my gosh probably not
the kind of holiday that everybody likes
for them what you may not know about me
is I secretly love this kind of thing
love of outdoor adventure so where I'm
heading off in a minute - what are we
doing just gonna have a job collecting
some data from elephants dung something
like that so yes
briefing up at the main part of the camp
and we have our first mission of the day
we're going to well over the day it's
five o'clock so we're going to head out
now into the wilderness the bracken come
up with the official term was and we're
going to lay out some cameras so that we
can track where the animals are but
they're eating what they're doing and
yet see if we can get some of the action
so we've just that balance you Catherine
one of them by a slope which took my
kids a lot of animal activity and number
one by watering holes that have us
captured some and now we've just heard
on the radio that this
the hill so we're just making my way
back home ask Ashley
good morning so it's our first full day
here at Gondwana in the Eco Lodge we
slept obviously in our lovely tent last
night which was surprisingly cozy we
both slept really really well
did here a few rustlings of some animals
in the middle of the night we were woken
up at half past 6 with the sound of the
horn and then we headed out to breakfast
which was in the main cabin Brendan and
his wife Stevie who are kind of looking
after estate prepared yoga and muesli
loads of cereal and eggs on toast so
really lovely breakfast and then we are
heading out now to go on a game count in
the Land Rovers see what animals we can
find
we've just returned back to our lovely
cabin in the I was gonna say cabin in
the woods if it's not many words is that
cabin in the jungle what do you call
this having a new governess after a
really super morning tracking game so
that basically meant that whenever we
saw animals and we took a really long
route all the way around the reserve we
just had to make a note exactly where we
were using the GPS and making it what
animals there were and how many and
before that we tracked the lion so I
showed some clips of this big metal like
satellite and the Lions had trackers on
them so we could hear faint beeping we
followed the beep and then we saw the
two female lions we followed them for a
little bit and they led us to the male
who apparently is the biggest male that
our Ranger has ever even seen so it was
a really huge male got to see him like
rolling on his back it looked a little
bit like Dexter's a new child yeah so
that was really really nice good start
today we still haven't seen any
elephants yet so that's them leaving one
thing for us to find but we're back at
the tent now after about four hours out
and we're gonna quickly just have a bit
of a chill I'm gonna take some photos
and then we're gonna have a lunch which
i think is chicken wraps which is all
made in the so I'll give you a proper
tour of that in the daylight now except
I think I really showed you that
yesterday but I'm gonna take some photos
out on our lovely little balcony which
is here and I'm gonna photograph some
Gondwana essentials which includes
Neal's Yard Organic defence hand spray
this body oil which is also anti
mosquito and of course some good Sun
lotion
you are rude hi guys Josie here you
watch my channel doorknob it's a few
hours later now Johnny shut up
it's a few hours later now and we've
spent past three hours
just chilling relaxing on the sunshine I
went and used the outdoor shower up on
the hill shed up that which was an
interesting experience ilysm it was nice
actually looking out into the wilderness
while shampooing my hair and now it's
about quarter to four and we're going to
head up to the main tent and see if we
can get some snacks and I have a cup of
tea and then just after 4:00 we're gonna
head out and we are chopping it down
some was a clear water is it called
water yeah yeah so we're gonna chop down
some mortal which is this tree which is
very flammable and also tends to take
over so we need to try and reduce the
amount of water all trees in a certain
area so that's the plan
we've just spent the past half-hour or
so chopping down and we're all quite not
good Soto's a bit of a break and look at
where we are now
look at the skin for the amazing views
wow we are pretty much at the home
estate
spazz
good morning it's our second morning
here at Gondwana we had a slightly less
peaceful night seat last night because
there was an absolutely ginormous rain
spider in our room and when I say Jo
Norma's UK spiders have nothing on this
it was literally I'm pretty much the
size in my hat okay does
over-exaggeration is right like size of
my hand I'm really fat body hairy legs
so we had to get one of the Rangers to
come in them one of the Rangers we had
to get Brendan's come and remove it in a
giant Tupperware for us because there
was no way I was going to sleep with a
massive spider in our tent and had a
nice breakfast this morning lovely cup
of coffee and we are heading down to the
Ranger to the Jeep now Land Rover and
we're going to do a wetland survey so
they have to do a wetland survey on each
lake at least once a year
pool of body of water at least once a
year just to make sure there's enough
enough wildlife in so we're going to be
looking for things like mayflies and La
Vie what do they call that no all the
little bugs that live in pools of water
we're going to counting them and making
sure there's a good population of bugs
yeah
we've just been collecting the SD cards
from the cameras that we made yesterday
company could have caught anything on
the video and because my camera is not
opening the file formats but on the
photo ones on camera didn't get anything
and the other camera got some birds so
nothing terribly exciting but hopefully
we'll have caught some kind of video
camera yes
what is that there
my t-zone yeah Wow Oh next
maybe we co say crap how does it get we
have finished our wetlands survey and we
found loads of little creepy crawlies
including the cute crabs as well and we
did these equations and found that our
lake within natural condition which is
the best that you can reach a water
feature so we did well
yes
sadly we have had to leave Gondwana
today so we've driven the four hours
back to Cape Town we're nearly back now
to our next hotel I was spending four
nights had a really really super time at
Gondwana half my darling yeah awesome
yeah we didn't have a really really good
time I think if you guys at this team
Cape Town or South Africa in general and
definitely definitely make time to go to
con guano I don't think thank tonight's
was a good amount of time look is very
nice would have been perfect yeah
three nights would've been even better
days three nights it wasn't really what
I was expecting I didn't realize just
how up close and personal we would get
to the animals we've really got to do
really got to see what the Rangers do on
a daily basis it's like counting the
Lions in the game can we even did like a
wetland survey this morning so it's
really nice to do something a little bit
above and beyond just your normal Safari
but still getting it is leaders turn
left on Street just left
but still getting to see all of them
still getting to see all of the animals
as well so it's really really fabulous
experience and I will be writing all
about it on the blog so you can go and
have a look at loads of photos and read
more about it on there so because we're
spending the next few days here in Cape
Town for the next ten days or so camps
bay rather I think I will end this vlog
here advice it's going to be another of
my level you half-hour-long vlogs so
make sure you check out the next one
which I'll publish in a few days time
