South Africa travel diary video whoo you
guys enjoyed part 1 where we were at
Elliman house in Cape Town and also
Gondwana on our eco Game Reserve Safari
which was absolutely fabulous I'll leave
that links down below in case you didn't
see it but now we're back in Cape Town
and for the next 4 days we are staying
at the beautiful Twelve Apostles Hotel
which is really close to camp space so
just a very short drive outside of Cape
Town staying in Cape Town for the next
10 days so this vlog is all going to be
Cape Town we're going to be doing things
like climbing lions head going on some
tours hopefully climbing to Table
Mountain as well and there's lots of
chilling spa treatments that kind of
things it's going to be a good ten days
or so so as I mentioned we are at 12
apostles now for the next four days and
our hotel room is absolutely beautiful
it's actually a one-bedroom suite and
it's honestly the most beautiful very
Instagram of all rooms I'm gonna give
you a little tour of the room now so
this is the main room as you walk in
beautiful light blue actually silk on
the walls really beautiful kind of wall
design embroidered leaves and then we've
got speed for old fashioned mirror very
nice kind of old-school French style and
then we've got beautiful mirror tables a
lovely sofa a coffee table down there
minibar coffee areas here we've got a
little desk where I was doing my emails
at five o'clock this morning chair and a
bureau and then we have a beautiful
table area here got some fruits and
Sparky wine and some goodies for from
the hotel to read through got some
brochures and also a little notebook
which was nice this is our view so we
have a few trees from the hotel garden
and then you can just see the see behind
that
so downstairs I'll take you in a second
is the pool area and there's a beautiful
view of the sea from that then through
this doorway away from the lounge we
have our bedroom my messy suitcase in
the corner there don't look at that and
then here is our bed beautiful huge
king-size bed really comfortable lovely
mirror on the wall I just love the color
scheme in here that's kind of duck egg
blue but TV which folds out and then a
lovely French armoire style chest of
drawers another beautiful painting then
through here supreme is honestly so
massive we have huge double wardrobes
saumensch I don't have to fight the
space because he's got one side and I've
got the other then in there is the
bathroom putting on some Sun cream
oceans I won't go next I'm not sure you
have any clothes on so we decided to
come down to Krypton Beach not watch the
sunset with us enjoy the last few hours
sunshine really peaceful quite a big
beach not too many people here
Charlie went for a dip but it was so
cold that I decided to just paddle my
feet into the Atlantic Ocean this yoga
an antic ocean so basically is the water
from Antarctica right well it's just the
cold ocean yet you've got the Indian
Ocean on one side
boy it got over here and so yeah we've
just spent the past few hours relaxing
reading magazines after really really
lovely three-course lunch at the hotel
which was amazing and then we just took
some photos because the lighting is
really nice at the moment I'm gonna head
back to hotel now quick change and then
I hope you'll make it into town to
sunset and have a little walk around
camps bay and then find somewhere nice
we do that
back at the hotel and we're about to go
out for dinner now we've got a
reservation at a place called the
Roundhouse which is not too far away
from here we're going to drive because
we rented a car for the trip I thought
I'd do a quick outfit and makeup off the
evening just got my hair tied up still
quite beachy and I've got the Guerlain
terracotta foundation on which is really
nice one products it's not too heavy
two-faced eyeshadow Clarins waterproof
mascara and then I used a new Topshop
contour lip pencil on my lips along with
the Tom Ford first time pink lipstick
which you guys know I always wear and I
really really like the combination let
me show you my dress so if you watched
my spring wardrobe essentials video you
might recognize this it's the Miss
Selfridge rotary Anglais dress little
shirt top here I look a bit pink when
honestly not and then little bow
fastening and I'm wearing my sandals
there we go from accessorize and this
dress I saw in the sale has gone down
into 29 pounds I'll leave a link to this
down below so heading out now Charlie is
getting me a dress up on his Google Maps
so yeah I'll do that
good morning so it's seven o'clock in
the morning Charlie and I are up bright
and early because we're going to climb
the line of heads and hopefully we'll
catch the sunrise which is just starting
to hear over on the horizon behind me
you excited darling oh yeah
Charlie's done this before a couple
years ago tells me it's not too bad but
it's quite cute at the top right yeah
pretty easy I mean looks pretty steep so
let's get going
we made it projects about power
Thunder under an hour pretty tough not
go away
look at this view so worth it
we are on our way down now we finished a
rocky bit and now we're just on the
normal pathway
I was absolutely roasting so I had to
take my clothes off luckily I've got a
bucket on underneath - really
and eight close to nine in the morning
now there's already four layers in try
this is what cut belt on yeah buddy good
and we are both dreaming about what
breakfast we're going to have
ooh
spend the day today on the beach were
heading to a beach know which is about a
10 minute drive from our hotel hopefully
we don't get lost
sounds quite well yeah it does sounds
like a beach in Weymouth it's a really
nice day
yeah
I think they've discovered my perfect
beach so many dogs here
good morning it is Sunday morning and
today we're going on a lovely tour of
Cape Town and the whole Western cable
set
well yeah kind of like a yeah basically
we're doing and days tour with Jarrod so
it's pretty really lovely so far we were
picked up yeah we picked up my hotel at
9 o'clock 12 years relax guy and our
first port also pays attention to Seal
Island Ferry now it's gonna go to Seal
Island
we've already seen a seal verite one
so we survived our trip to Seal Island
I saved the vibe because those waves
were absolutely ridiculous
Stephanie wasn't expecting that I'd say
about 20k high waves are they darling
yeah they were very rocky area we
thought maybe the waves meant that it
was a bit protected so no danger of the
good-old great whites hopping back in
the car now not too sure our next stop
is
Island stopped a few viewpoints to take
in the absolutely beautiful views and
now Roger has moved into place from farm
village and it's so cute essentially
like a little shop selling handmade
things just going over to juice market
fresh juice built on I guess that's a
good thing about doing these talks
because you'll never found this place
what my spirits making noise
we are back in our own car now doesn't
feel quite as snugly as the lovely
Mercedes e-class we've been joining
around in all day had a really fab time
with Roger from Jarek tours so Thank You
Roger for super day we went to an up
chapman's peak we went to the penguin
beach which was amazing on his beach

from Kristin Kristin Bakshi custom
custom Botanical Garden which is really
really a point

which you should definitely visit if
you're going to come to Cape Town so
really super day now we're heading to
our next hotel where Jenny here at one
for one night it's called mana camps bay

we're going to head down to the
waterfront again because Charlie wants
to a seafood and I want some steak and
show he's got a restaurant in mind which
trust runners are doing fire more to say
so we're gonna quickly check in get
changed redo my makeup and then head out
fit enough
good morning it is Monday I'm losing
track of time of what data it's Monday
and we've moved hotels again we are now
in tin swallows and we're here for the
next few days and this place is
absolutely beautiful I'm going to give
you a very quick room tour because Joey
and I are dying to go out and sunshine
in this room so we are staying in the
Zanzibar room and look how beautiful
this sign is oh gosh librarian every
single room is named after a different
Island and we're staying on the sons of
God are these beautiful doors which are
made in India and they've been
sun-blasted down to give us really
lovely texture Chinese just having a run
out in the middle ah sweeties so we have
a load of sweeties in our minibar and
there's a fridge and here as well and
team could be mixed so we've got some
brandy or something as well in there but
then this is the main room so you have
this humongous bad absolutely gorgeous
bed and the whole room is themed around
Zanzibar so we have a little seaside
bits and bobs like this little starfish
gorgeous ceilings reminds me of the
Maldives so beautiful
and then we've got all our things
they're lovely wardrobe and then this
incredible view look at this
well while we were so this is our little
Terrace and then possibly my favorite
part of the room is the bathroom so we
have this view from the bathtub gorgeous
little tray here with lots of bits and
bobs bath foam shampoo and conditioner
and they will put little shell or their
lids which is very cute
got another beautiful little tray area
over here gorgeous kind of silver pewter

sinks which is good for me and Charlie

detail on the walls another little tray
and the shower so as you can see I'm
rather chopped to be here it's a
beautiful hotel and we're just gonna go
out to the pool now which I will show
you and enjoy some sunshine
hey guys I have to apologize for lack of
vlogging last time I picked up the
camera I was about this time yesterday
but to be honest we have been too busy
relaxing my chief looks really funny a
bit shiny from the Sun we've been too
busy relaxing our lens cover is not even
probably me to vlog but I'm gonna pick
it up again now so it's our second day
here at the beach port in swallow
Atlantic hotel and we're just so so in
love with this place it's so gorgeous
we've spent the morning by the pool it
was quite cloudy this morning there's a
bit of a thunderstorm and a rain storm
at 8 o'clock but that all blew away and
it's now about 28 degrees I feel like I
picked up a little bit of color today
not sure if you can see I feel like I've
got a little bit tanned and we also took
some photos when it was a little bit
cloudy before it heated up and now we
are just about to have lunch in the main
restaurant or the restaurant which is on
the decking overlooking the sea so
really beautiful view it's really nice
actually because they don't have a menu
they just tell you what they've got in
that day so there's no no food wastage
so the chef came over towards me said oh
I've got some great tuna this morning so
don't have that and Charlie was like yes
but I unfortunately don't really like
fish so I just said we got anything else
and he said he's got some really nice
steak as well so he's gonna make me a
nice steak or he said beef so I'm
presuming it's gonna be steak so that's
really really lovely we also had a fab
dinner last night which is the same no
choices really you just have a set menu
and whatever they've got fresh they make
for you so the food here it's absolutely
incredible breakfast was a three-course
breakfast i snapchatted it all so maybe
you guys have been calling my snapchats
look I have actually got a tan line and
that's just from today because I didn't
have this star bikini on any other day
I've changed to a strap this one now so
yeah that's a little update for you I am
gonna head back into the restaurant now
I just came to pick up my camera and
I'll show you the views from our table
because it really is spectacular
so in the time that we were at lunch
look what appeared oh my gosh tan lines
Oh Rama so Chaz and I are going to put a
little bit more cream on all right
definitely on and then we're gonna go to
the pool it's probably still about 27
degrees would you say doing yeah bit
Dewar and I'm probably going to lie on
my front 10 my back a little bit read a
magazine or two and enjoy the sunshine
we're just heading out to dinner now I'm
going to do it last night I'm gonna get
Charlie to do a quick video of my outfit

evening the chef leaves little messages

starting to pack up a few of our bits
