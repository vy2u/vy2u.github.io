spending the night tonight and we've got
such a beautiful room and this ginormous
balcony / Terrace area which I will show
you
huge huge fireplace behind me and the
most beautiful view looking out over the
valley
swimming pool I'll show you inside the
room as well just absolutely ginormous
big double bed or king-size huge
wardrobe our choice talking about at the
sea minibar in here and then we've got a
lovely bathroom big counter area with
two sinks huge shower and then a
gorgeous bath area as well
much better what have you gone for
darling traditional good and I've got 14
hours slow roasted lamb
I'm feeling pretty full from lunch but
we come into my spoon of peanut sauce
good evening it's a few hours later now
and Charlie knows spent the past couple
of hours just relaxing we were quite
tired for some reasons we're just
watching some Parks and Recreation in
the room suddenly it started to cloud
over little bits I think we've had our
luck when it comes to blue skies I think
the forecast is looking a little bit
grim with the rest of this day but we've
had our relaxation and just got changed
on my makeup again and we're heading out
for dinner now so we're going to this
place called foliage which loads of
people would recommend it to us and
apparently it's quite experimental so
I'm looking forward to that I might go
and find somewhere on friendship I would
say high street but it's just a few
shots of the Maine friendship road and
for a couple of drinks beforehand quick
outfit of the evening it's probably the
best way to show my top is here so I
bought this top kind of especially for
the Winelands part of our trip it's from
French Connection but I couldn't find it
on the website so I'm afraid I can't
link it but you're pretty be able to
find it in the stores but it's got
really cute kind of frilly sleeves just
really like all the details and it's
quite prairie girlish and then flip the
camera around I'm just wearing the jeans
I was wearing earlier these are from
American Eagle they're really nice and
elasticated so nice fit and then my Oak
Ridges so we are heading out now and I
will see you later
yeah
in our hotel room now after what was
probably our best meal in South Africa
so far would you agree darling it's very
very good meal quite quite experiment
but South African experimental not like
yeah not one guarantee said see yeah we
all had time we both had three lovely
lovely courses Charlie actually noticed
that one of the chef's they were all
working so hard one of the chef's
actually had a platypus light you know
those straws I have the water coming out
of your backpack so just working so hard
non-stop but really really showed the
food was absolutely delicious and not
gonna lie man a bit of a food coma now
feeling very so to Parks and Recreation
there's no bit early night I think it's
going to raining in the mornings I'm
probably gonna do some emails and stuff
while Charlie has a lion and then we're
going it to take Frostmourne tastings
actually good fun so I shall see you in
the morning
good morning so it's our first and only
day in the Winelands today we woke up
this morning to the sound of torrential
rain it was absolutely pouring on we
woke up this morning and so we spent
last night in our room at la petit Firm
which as I said yesterday is in the
heart of the Rhinelands region in
frantic in South Africa we had a really
really super meal last night at Bosch
which I showed you last night so it was
really really nice and then had a lovely
breakfast this morning and the hotel is
actually starting to find a little bit
now that the forecast says rain all day
but doesn't bother us too much we're
travelling now I think it's about a half
hour drive to stellenbosch and there we
are going to the Telegraph estate so
we're gonna do some wine tasting we've
got lunch and yeah it is starting to
brighten up so hopefully should be quite
a nice Drive we're gonna have a look
around 7:00 rush town so should be fun
morning oh yeah
he never watches
yeah
a little while since I picked up the
blogging camera but I'll fill you in on
what we've been doing today so we left
La Petite firm in friendship this
morning and then we joke about half an
hour to stellenbosch which is kind of
like it's the main Wineland town really
when you beautiful town we had looked in
a few of the shops there bought some
amazing biltong for this place called
built on and brew which apparent is
gonna be opening in London so keep a
lookout for that and then we went to the
deli Graff estate and Telegraph or della
was an estate and then it was bought by
the Graf family who are from Graff
diamonds and we had an amazing
three-course lunch there really really
lovely dinner we had or I had arancini
risotto balls to start with which were
amazing and then I had a chicken main
course Charlie had what do you have a
starter some fish cake number five and
then we had a strawberry cheesecake ice
cream and Rose flavored jelly for
dessert it was probably my favorite meal
of this whole trip which is definitely
saying something because we have had
amazing amazing food on this trip and
then we had a tour of the grounds which
are just stunning
like mr. Graff has done an amazing
amazing job there so it was a really
really nice to have a look around and
then we drove another 45 minutes and
we're back in Cape Town now and we're
spending our final two nights here at
the Manor Bay Hotel and it's really
really beautiful little boutique hotel
we arrived checked in about half an hour
ago 20 minutes ago and we've just come
into our room and we're staying in the
orchid room so everything around me is
completely orchid themed you've got
orchid wallpaper orchid paintings an
actual orchid over there somewhere
it's a really lovely room and I said
we're going to be spending a lot of time
in here because the weather forecast for
today and tomorrow is pretty much cloud
and rain and wind so I think they're
going to be having a cozy few days here
which I'm quite thankful for because
I've got a lot of work to do but let me
give you a very quick room tour it's not
going to take long because it's quite a
petite room especially not that petite
it's just all in one place so we have
this lovely big kind
of main area here got a little library I
like how they've chosen like purple and
green books to go with the color scheme
of the room huge TV which has got like
movies and everything all built in for
free we've got an iPad over here which
controls the TV a huge bed in the middle
of the room
Chazz unpacking and then if we go back
here behind the bed we've got a bathroom
beautiful kind of marble bathroom with
all the toiletries let's see what we've
got
got some body lotion got some shower
caps sewing kits and then a really
lovely big rain shower they also have
this little area on here they've got a
pre-packed beach bag which is such a
nice idea and then oops in the drawers
you've got blankets slippers and a
laundry bag what's in this one and then
we've got a little welcome plaster over
here with some strawberries and
chocolate not sure what that is but I
will eat it now a little booklet and
then outside we have a little balcony
which would have views of Table Mountain
that is Table Mountain but currently
covered in cloud a little balcony
overlooking the hotel grounds which are
a nice swimming pool and a pond between
five which is now so we're going to go
down and grab some bits and bobs for
afternoon tea and just chill for a
couple of hours before we head out for
dinner
hey guys so it is currently about four
o'clock in the afternoon I've been a
very good 5 o'clock every afternoon I've
been the horrendous vlogger today but
basically we haven't really done that
much today because if you look behind me
okay you can't really see but actually
gray gray clouds and pouring with rain
so not exactly what we wanted for our
last full day in Cape Town but we went
to the waterfront this morning to the
Victoria Wolfe shopping centre and some
little look around the shops which is
really nice
didn't buy anything too exciting
different no no no not really we did buy
some more biltong and some wine to take
home with us though which I'm sure
friends and family will be very very
grateful for we spent a couple of hours
walking around the shops and then we
came back to the hotel and I've pretty
much been working all day so not the
terribly exciting day but nice and
productive so yes 5 o'clock now we're
going to go downstairs because the hotel
put on afternoon tea between half and
half fives are going to go and grab some
bits and bobs and yeah then we're going
out with me a little bit later it's not
too much report today tomorrow morning
we're praying it's gonna be a little bit
clearer because we still haven't climbed
to Table Mountain I really really wanted
to do it but anything like today that
the orders be appalling so we absolutely
no point so fingers crossed we have been
very lucky with the weather so far I
think if it had been this weather any
other day on the trip we've been gutted
but it's not too bad but it's our last
day so we're gonna go and get some
afternoon tea now and I will see you
loosen it up
I have been a terrible vlogger today and
have you picked up the camera at all so
I do apologize for lack of footage but
you guys really haven't missed that much
we basically got ready for dinner after
watching a lot of Parks and Recreation
and I did manage to get a few blog shows
done and then we went to a really cool
place called clue the street house
yeah free Street house which is really
hard to see which is my favorite dinner
place this chokes we've eaten so many
amazing places yeah it was very kind of
New York slash shortage very very nice
restaurant it was kind of indoor/outdoor
there was like tiled tables and plants
everywhere had a really lovely steak and
a coffee and I had a nice full
redecorate as well so another really
lovely meal a nice one for our last
evening in Cape Town so we're flying in
about four o'clock tomorrow so depending
on the weather we might do teal mountain
or we might just go to the gym in the
morning
and yes so that's the plan and then
we're heading back home which is rather
sighs but lots of more travels to look
forward to and of course I'll be
vlogging
lots more so yeah which I and I are
gonna head to bed now and I'll see you
guys and learning good morning we've
just woken up for our final morning here
in Cape Town well final day and thank
the Lord the clouds have disappeared so
it's beautiful clear skies this morning
and you see the view from our room which
previously we have in else Peaks it's
been all cloud cover but we just opened
up the blinds this morning to find it
this view so our room looks directly
onto Table Mountain look at that such a
gorgeous view
and if you look in that top corner there
you can see the top of the cable car and
that's where we're going to go now
three-sixty I traced their capture how I
intended a little bit chilly up here is
that going I should have brought jumper
yes
Charlie's regretting his outfit choice
we've got a little bit more cloudy right
to the same we can still see some really
beautiful views of the coast which I
will show you now and now I think we're
gonna take one of the walks as a few
different walks you can take around the
top I think we're gonna take like a half
hour one and try and find some gaseous
which of these really cute little kind
of very guinea pigs which live at the
top of here and I run the sing them when
I was at six years old and no one could
believe me that there are real things
though I'm determined to find one
back down from Table Mountain now and
we've got a car suckage once again
because sadly we are on our way back to
Cape Town we say I was that enough to
Australian so we got briefs telling us
to put our Sunny's on how good yeah good
night and I might use is pretty good so
yes we're heading back to the Apple and
sadly we're very very sad to be leaving
City Rica
but we're very excited to see a puppy
dog tomorrow the island he very excited
to see Dexter mom has been sending us
videos on a daily basis of his own of
him being naughty and playing with Coco
and Louie his bro and sis so we're just
looking for somewhere to grab some lunch
