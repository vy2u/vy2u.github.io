a super-duper week I have been feeling
kind of spendy this week so I went on a
few splurges and the biggest of all my
splurges was a bit of an a sauce haul
and I've kind of just been thinking
about what I want to wearing over the
next few weeks now that weather is
getting a little bit warmer I've just
wanted a few mostly bottoms of mckay for
tops I've got lots of kind of classic
tops but I've been getting the need for
some new bottoms so I thought I would
share with you some things I got a my
most recent a so school course I also
picked up some beauty pieces so I'm
going to show you guys those as well
okay so a couple of weekends ago I went
to afternoon tea with Antipodes at the
Berkeley and the outer you gorgeous Meg
from wonderful youth she was wearing
navy or think they might been black
clots and it just made me think oh I
really want to try them because she
looked absolutely amazing so one of the
things I've picked up is this pair of
clots from whistles and you can't really
see how long they are might try them on
and show a little picture but these I
really really like a pattern they're
quite lovely like floating material and
yeah I think they all look really cute
and nice and airy so I'm excited to give
these a try next thing I grabbed was
this skirt now this is actually an ASOS
own-brand skirt and how I'm taking look
here we go taking the bits off so I keep
seeing people wearing these and they
just look absolutely stunning so I
decided to pick one up to try it out
myself it's gonna be a really nice
length hopefully I haven't tried it on
yet but um yeah this is a source own
brand
it's a suede kind of material I'm not
sure if it actually is wet I don't think
if this was expensive enough to be
actual suede but it just looks really
gorgeous I love the color it's very kind
of cowboy ish with the pockets and the
really almost like brushed metal buttons
so it looks really really cute and
actually I'm glad that their buttons as
opposed to press studs because we were
at the rodeo event at the home yard
hotel and met a girl there Ashley James
and she had a skirt really similar to
this on but has impressed us and she
said that when she was going up
they kept popping open so I'm really
happy that these are little they're
actual buttons you have to on and loop
as opposed to press studs so really
really like this one
and if you like it as well I'm gonna pop
a little link down here somewhere so you
can you can check it out and go straight
to the product also thinking about
skirts
similarly quite a neutral color this is
one that I got from a sauce but it's
actually a warehouse skirt just taken
the tissue off the buckle so you can see
it's got a really cute gold buckle again
I think this is a really good length
probably as a work skirt might team it
with my white silk grease t-shirt
because I think that'll look really
classic and with some white heels I've
got those white Zara pointy court shoes
so I'll probably team it with that I
think this will look really lovely so
this is a warehouse one again I'll pop
the link down that and then the last bit
of clothing that I grabbed was this pair
of trousers really lovely pattern
trousers enough from French Connection
and I think they're going to be really a
bit of a clash I think they'll be a
really really lovely pattern when
they're on I just loved pattern trousers
I think they're such easy things to
stick on and this is quite um it's
cotton but it's quite crispy so I think
it'll be a nice may be traveling
trousers perfect for going in a car for
road trips if you've got a staycation
but yeah I think I really lovely pattern
and hopefully they'll fit nicely French
Connection trousers usually fit me quite
well so yeah I'm really looking forward
to trying these on and then the last
thing I got was his t-shirt from a
source so it's actually a roll neck in a
knitted material I'm not sure if you can
see that and then on the back it's got
like then the bit down the middle but I
thought this would look really cute
that's a bit of a transition piece I
know it's kind of getting a little bit
more a lot warmer now but I love row
necks I'm a little bit phobic of the
fact that I'm gonna get makeup all over
this so I'm gonna have you really
careful when I try it on but low roll
necks I love white roll next so I
thought I'd give this one a try okay so
there is exciting part I picked up loads
of beauty products as well and the first
is the new Naz foundation so I didn't
actually realise how I may
the a sauce beauty section is but you
can literally get like all your favorite
stuff there so this is the NARS all day
luminous weightless foundation it's the
new one I haven't actually tried it yet
so I'll let you guys know how I get on
with it
I picked up the shade medium - that
Santa Fe and unlike the muscle called
the glow one the original contra it's
called NARS sheer glow yep it comes with
a pump which is amazing because I always
feel like I'm getting a little bit
ripped off when I buy the nonce normal
foundation and then I have to buy the
pump as well so this one comes with the
pump which I'm really really pleased
about so grab that one I also picked up
a few things from Paul and Joe or so on
the ASOS beauty section and the first
thing and the one that I've been really
really loving is this absolutely
ginormous mirror it's a really lovely
soft pink kind of pearly color and the
mirror inside it I want to show you the
camera is it's absolutely gianormous so
it's amazing from the handbag it's
SuperDuper slim and I just think this is
beautiful and I love it so I'm really
really glad I picked this up
I've already been using it loads and
then also from Paul and Joe I've got
that I makeup remover now I have to
admit I'm really really shallow and I
actually just fell in love in the bottle
how cute is that it's so pretty I
haven't tried it yet so again I don't
know how well it works but I just think
this is absolutely stunning I love all
paul and joe packaging i've got their
little brow fitting it's about this big
pink it's like a mini mini mini version
of this and it's just the most beautiful
thing always so proud to pull it out of
my makeup bag I just think it's most
adorable things so this is gonna look
amazing in my bathroom cabinet and it's
yeah it's tackle is that I make it
remover so I'm really excited to try
this and then finally and this one I am
so excited to try out because it just
sounds like the most amazing thing ever
it's the ciate gel talks starter kit and
what this does is it turns any nail
varnish that you've currently got into
gel and varnish so I believe
it comes with yes it's got the top coat
and the UV light in it and what I'm
presuming you're going to have to do is
paint your nails in your normal color
any brand doesn't have to be a CRA one
so like an Essie or Rimmel whatever and
then take the top coat over it and set
it in the light and you've got 14 day
polish so I'm just going to get it Alex
I'm so excited to see what this looks
like
okay so inside so this is a top coat
it's a really decent size so 12 million
whoops this is a 12 minute liter bottle
so really good size I think this'll last
maybe like and 50 manicures don't quote
me on that but yeah really big and then
this is an amazing kind of travel size
though UV love that I've got the moment
it's broken firstly but it's about that
big so I mean so time really really tiny
so that's amazing
you've also got one of these amazing but
four blocks in here I never used to buff
my nails before doing gel manicures
myself because I always thought it made
the nail too smooth and made the gel
flick off but it's always useful to have
maybe I didn't read the instructions
properly last time so I'll give that a
go and then you've also got gel tops
cleanser when I first read that I
thought was a cleanness I thought it
might have been to clean the the light
but now obviously it's probably to
cleanser nails because your nails have
to be super clean before you start
applying your gel manicure also there's
tiny adorable little cuticle stick in
here for pushing back the cuticles and
then this is one of those kind of like
sharp ended bits so really good at
making sure your cuticles that
absolutely push back of course it's got
all the instructions and everything so
I'm gonna have a play of this tonight I
cannot wait to give it a go and I'll
probably do a review on the blog but if
you want me to do a video of how to do
it and what colors I'm really loving
doing with a gel kit so let me know
leave a comment and I'll do a little
video for it the only other thing that
was in my a sauce box was a dove men
care expert shave
so my stubble will be I'm really pleased
about that kind of random they probably
should have guessed that I was a female
judging by the items that I bought and
put a girl thing
that Charlie will be more than happy to
test this out for me
so yeah total comfort shave cream so
that's everything that I picked up in my
ASOS splurge recently I hope you've
enjoyed fumbling through or with me I've
really enjoyed sharing it with you if
this is the kind of video that you guys
enjoy watching if you'd like to see my
other shopping splurges which there are
quite a few of then let me know and I'll
happily go through all my shopping bags

the corner and every Sunday we can go
