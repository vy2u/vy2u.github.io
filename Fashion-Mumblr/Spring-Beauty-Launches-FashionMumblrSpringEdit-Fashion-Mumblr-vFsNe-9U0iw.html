joining me for today's video it is the
third video off the fashion mumbler
spring edit I really hope you guys are
enjoying my spring videos so far I have
already uploaded my everyday drugstore
spring makeup routine using drugstore
products I think I might have said
drugstore twice and that forgive me and
also my spring wardrobe essentials so my
top 10 things in my wardrobe that are
going to be the core items of my spring
wardrobe and also giving you some tips
on how to put together your spring
wardrobe so I really hope you've enjoyed
those two videos so far today's video is
going to be all about my favorite spring
Beauty launches now I normally do this
monthly but this season there are so
many amazing launches from some of my
absolute favorite brands and I have to
say right from the word go this video is
going to be largely focused on high-end
brands very aspirational products but
you know what it is just so lovely to
have a look at all these products and
hopefully I can help you decide whether
you would like to splurge and maybe
treat yourself to a few of these pieces
and let you know how I got along with
them if you are new to my channel then
it would mean a lot to me if you would
subscribe and then you won't miss any of
my videos I post all kinds of things
from travel videos outfit Diaries to
beauty reviews and loads of those kind
of things so definitely hit that little
subscribe button if you'd like to see
more from me that would mean a lot to me
today's video is going to be all about
my favorite spring Beauty launches so so
many of my favorite brands have released
their spring and summer collections and
I have to say they are gorgeous this is
the first time that I've just been so
blown away by so many collections that I
had to put a video together to just show
you all of my favorite new releases
there are quite a lot to go through so
without further rambling intro I'm going
to get started the first new release I
wanted to show you is one that caused
the most uproar on my snapchat when I
revealed it to you guys and when I slit
up for all I mean love I got so many
hearts I emojis when I posted a snap of
these guys and it is the zoeva rose
golden brush set volume 3 so I'm ashamed
to say
I do have volume 1 and volume 2 but
still felt the need to add volume 3 to
my collection because they are so
beautiful I used some of your brushes so
regularly on an everyday basis and I'm
always so blown away by the quality of
them they are absolutely stunning to
look at and they work they last really
well I've had my first set for probably
a year and a half now and as I said
using it every single day it's been in
the countless makeup bags it's flown
around the world with me and it's still
looking absolutely beautiful they all
wash really well as well this one in
particular is a contour or east I use it
for contour and blush and it's still
brand new looking and white because I've
washed it just with normal soap two or
three times so if you're worried about
them being white and looking dirty don't
be because they get back to looking
beautiful in you just after one wash I
think value for money wise zoeva brushes
are absolutely the greatest you get so
many brushes in the set and honestly
each and every one of them is so
versatile you have seen me using these
in my everyday makeup routine video and
you'll be seeing a lot more of them on
my blog Instagram snapchat YouTube you
name it so get used to seeing these guys
around because I am in love next up is a
super super super high-end
skincare product in fact this is without
doubt the most expensive thing I've ever
put on my face but I'm pleased to report
that it is absolutely incredible is in
on another level incredible and it is
the library Swiss crystal serum and it's
part of their new range which is
targeted at a younger audience those
that are slightly concerned with the
very first signs of aging but it's more
about targeting Aging but it's more
about preventing aging than actually
healing it so better to start before you
get any of those fine lines and wrinkles
so this really does protect the skin
from environmental aggressors and
pollution and the kind of radicals in
the air that cause our skin to age plus
it feels absolutely heavenly this is
like applying angels to my face I don't
know how to describe it it honestly is
the most luxurious feeling serum I've
ever tried and I'm soon to try out the
rest lose my voice I haven't seem to try
out the rest of the range as well so I
can't wait to keep you updated on the
rest of the range speaking of super
and luxurious I can't go any further
without showing you this most beautiful
palette from the Tom Ford summer
collection which is their sole a range
and oh my god can we just take a moment
to appreciate this palette ah it's so
gorgeous both outside with this
beautiful white summery packaging and on
the inside I've got a ginormous mirror
and then you've got a beautiful
beautiful coral pink blush console
powder and highlight as well I took so
long photographing this the other day
because I just love photographing Tom
Ford products they are all it's so
beautiful
and their entire Soleil range is
absolutely stunning I've been lucky
enough to try this and also their new
perfume which is Saleh Blanc and this as
well equally beautiful but another
absolutely stunning product the smell of
this is like it's like beautiful
tropical gardens but very much kind of
still Mediterranean II if that makes
sense I'm useless at describing perfumes
but you guys definitely need to go to a
counter and get a whiff of this because
it's so gorgeous and this beautiful work
packaging perfect my Instagram theme not
gonna lie and just looks absolutely
gorgeous on my dressing table next I
wanted to tell you about some gorgeous
summer launches from Clarins I can
barely hold them all and by the way this
isn't even the whole collection these
are just me choosing my favorite pieces
but Clarins spring collections and
summer collections are always absolutely
gorgeous and this one is no different
this time I feel like a lot of the
products are seriously useful as well so
very easy to justify splurging on
firstly this is what's it officially
called it's called the double fix
mascara and basically it's a waterproof
topcoat for your mascara and if there's
a brand that I trust when it comes to
making products waterproof it is Clarins
they're truly waterproof mascara
sunshine problems artists i think it's
called truly waterproof it might be like
the ultra waterproof but basically
Clarins waterproof mascara is the most
waterproof thing I've ever put on my
face it does not budge unless you have
the right remover so this I will be
trying out next week in South Africa but
I'm really looking forward to putting
this to the test and I have full faith
in Carnes
really is completely waterproof another
useful launch from the current summer
collection is the fix makeup spray so
this is a long-lasting makeup hold spray
which also really hydrates the skin
Clarins actually bought something very
similar out I believe last spring in the
long thin pink tube which is absolutely
gorgeous such a pleasure to use a real
fine mist and again I think this is just
the updated version with new packaging
and I think this smaller bottle is a lot
easier to take in your travel suitcase
so another great one for summer holidays
now Clarins must have had beach makeup
on the mind when they designed their
summer collection because these
eyeshadows there are few more in the
range but these are my two favorites
they are 0-1 golden peach and 0-2 Golden
Sun so two very classic shades no
surprise coming from me they are
waterproof cream eyeshadows I'm not sure
if I said that at the beginning but they
definitely are the perfect kind of thing
for heading to the beach or if you're
just going somewhere really lovely in a
hot and maybe humid this will not budge
I tried to swatch on the back of my hand
the other day and I checked back at the
complete end of the day even after I'd
washed my face and it was still there I
had to give it a real good wipe down
with my Clarins eye makeup remover to
get rid of this so I cannot wait to try
this on the beach this year and of
course the Clarins summer collection
would not be complete without their
massive bronzers I love how huge these
are I feel like I'm getting so much
value for my money with these bronzers
this one in particular has got a darker
shade of shimmery shade a slightly
lighter shade and also a beautiful blush
in the middle so you can really target
the area that you want to apply the
color to your face as always gorgeous
big compact you've got this beautiful
big mirror in the lid which means that
you can just take it as your travel
mirror and just overall a beautiful huge
compact you won't use this in your
travel bag that is for sure another
gorgeous launch from Clarins but wait
I'm not done with Clarins yet they have
released some incredible skincare
launches recently as well and I have
currently been trying out their new
booster drops you may remember last
summer I did a lot of blog post about
their tanning booster drops where
basically you apply a few drops of their
intense tanning lotion into your normal
daily moisturizer and it builds up a
beautiful gradual tan well these are a
similar idea but they target different
skin care needs or concerns
so this one is one I've been trying out
and it's their detox one perfect for the
Navy fulfilling a little bit was where
you had a little bit too much night
before your skin's a bit dehydrated a
bit stressed out just add a couple of
drops of this to moisturizer and it
gives your skin all the ingredients and
needs there's also the energy droplets
and the repair droplets so depending on
your skin's need you can just choose the
droplets to target your skin condition
and add it to your daily moisturizer so
you don't need to completely switch
check your skincare routine such a good
idea coming from Cairns and I'm excited
to try the other two serums which I
haven't yet tested out next we have a
couple of very exciting launches from
benefits whenever benefit do and launch
I always get so excited and can't wait
to try it because you can guarantee
there's gonna be a lot of hype around it
and then you do the hula range is
absolutely no different so let's start
off with zero tanlines hula and this is
their zero tanlines the believable
all-over body bronzer so this comes with
a little cushion or sponge in the lid
and you just squirt some of the tan off
the cushion and buff it all over your
body so as you can imagine it just gives
you the most gorgeous flawless tan that
looks so real in fact if we follow
benefit and a few bloggers on instagram
you may have seen this little thing that
they did they took the girls away to
Barbados they took some gorgeous photos
and everyone's getting like oh look at
those beautiful turns they're beautiful
beach photos but then it was revealed
that these girls I had just done those
photos in a photo shoot in London which
i think is so genius the photos looks so
real their tans looks so real and it was
all thanks to this I've only tried this
on my leg so far but I can't wait to try
it all over my body because my legs are
absolutely gorgeous I went to an
exercise class and people were asking me
where I've been
so I can definitely vote before the
believable tan
they've also launched do the hula which
is a liquid bronzer I haven't actually
tried this yet I'm always a little bit
scared of liquid bronzers and I want
someone to show me how to do it first
but packaging wise it's absolutely
gorgeous you've got this almost kind of
a bamboo like gold tube a little pump
and then a matching I think this is
available to purchase separately and
brush it with a gorgeous turquoise and
very very soft bristles so excited to
try this new launch from benefit next up
is Estella
and I could have spent the next hour or
so telling you all about their new
summer launches but I'm gonna save that
for a blog post instead I've chosen my
two favorite pieces from the sauna
collection first of all is this little
bottle of bronze goddess body shimmer
spray so this is a beautiful shimmering
body oil which you can apply to your
legs your neck or your dÃ©colletage area
your arms whatever you want to have just
the most beautiful subtle shimmer for
holidays or even just summer evenings in
the UK this is going to be such an
essential and to make it even better
it is scented like you might have
guessed it Estee Lauder's bronze goddess
perfume in fact I wish you could just
spray this all over as a perfume anyway
because it smells so good but as a body
oil it's just the most heavenly product
it's not glittery in the slightest I'm
not sure if you can see it's just giving
me a beautiful Sheen that smell is
amazing and a really gorgeous glow that
on tanned skin in summer is going to
look so so so heavenly and they've also
brought out an absolutely beautiful
palette and this is their blush
highlight and contour trio I'm going to
give you a close-up so you can see just
how gorgeous these actual powders are
the three are in this beautiful little
case which is absolutely perfect for
traveling around this blush color is the
most beautiful springtime blush shade
that I've ever tried and such a lovely
natural colored contour as well it's
impossible to make your face orange or
muddy looking with this contour got it
on today very very subtly and I just
absolutely adore it if you want to see
more from the st.louis summer collection
and keep a look out on my blog because
very very soon I will have a review of
the whole of summer collection speaking
of things that smell amazing I had to
mention the girl on that terracotta
perfume I actually only discovered this
yesterday so when I say new launches
this is incredibly new to me as well but
as soon as I smelt it I was like that is
going to be my everyday summer perfume
because it's so it's so luxurious but
it's so well at the same time which i
think is quite hard to come by if they
are luxurious sometimes they're evening
only or special occasionally whereas
this I can see myself wearing every
single day day in day out once again I
am rubbish at describing perfumes but
this one
is very warming very oh it's almost
doodie kind of Ambria I want to savor
I'm probably getting that entirely wrong
so I'll leave a link down below if you
want to check out the ingredients then
go and have a little look but all I can
tell you is that it's kind of expensive
holidays in a bottle that sounds really
bad but that's what it reminds me of
alright just a few more to whiz through
and one that I've really been impressed
with is the new oh and I love the venom
of this the chubby in the nude stick
from Clarins every time I say that out
loud I just think it's such a funny name
I just imagine like naked tag to--he's
or something but this is a foundation
stick and fans of the chubby stick will
be so pleased to hear they thought out
futuristic in foundation I actually did
a first impressions of this on my
snapchat and so many of you guys said
how amazing it looked and in particular
the brush as well I've been applying the
foundation directly to my face just
scribbling it on and then blending it
out with this brush and this has just
knocked all my other makeup brushes out
of the park it is so good so quick and
easy to blend I couldn't believe the
amount of time that it took me to do my
makeup honestly it took less than a
minute to create such a beautiful
flawless base with this pad from
Clinique
now I know everything has been at quite
high end so far but when it comes to
nail varnish you really cannot beat
barium and they've just released a new
coconut oil range at least I think
coconut infusion is the official term
and I went to the press launch of this a
couple of days ago and was so impressed
by the claims of this nail varnish mate
so it's meant to last a couple of weeks
and to be honest with Barry and I
actually believe them because when I've
tried this on site sounds like some like
they like curing range it is the most
long-lasting non actual gel nail varnish
I've ever tried without a doubt and
their new coconut infusion Ranger just
lost one - there we go the new coconut
infusion range has all the same benefits
as that with its long lasting powers but
the coconut oil within it is also really
nourishing for the nails so if you're
worried about your nails getting dry or
cracked then this is the range you need
to go for because that extra ingredient
really adds just that bit of pampering
and care of your nails can we just take
a moment to appreciate how beautiful the
Elizabeth Arden spring/summer ranges and
photo
this is just their summer range
basically this is packaging goals it's
so gorgeous
you've got pinks and kind of curly warm
and the colors and then you've also got
some rose gold in there as well so when
it comes to my packaging preferences
this just ticks all the boxes so this is
the Elizabeth Arden's sunset bronzer and
aside from the packaging the product
inside itself is also an absolute and
taurine to use you've got a beautiful
very very subtle shimmer and I have to
say I don't think many of my bronzers
have shimmer in normally I'm quite
phobic of shimmer because I have got
oily skin and I don't want to look shiny
in any way but this is the most
beautifully fine shimmer that really
does just give your skin a gorgeous glow
but without being sparkly so don't be
afraid of the sparkles and this this
bronzer and the other pieces in the new
Elizabeth Arden range all kind of oh my
god I hope that's not broken I'll find
that afterwards and hold up these
instead the bronzer the lip glosses and
all the other pieces in the Elizabeth
Arden summer range all just make you
want to go on holiday to Ibiza and just
wear really bright makeup and just look
really flawless and fabulous and have
that gorgeous summer glow and the lip
glosses are all so shimmery but in a
very very wearable way I was a little
bit phobic of them when I first saw them
I was like that's not gonna look good on
my skin they actually tried out the gold
one and oh my gosh I will insert a clip
of me wearing this it is so stunning so
wearable and I feel like I need to book
a holiday to Ibiza just so I can wear
this lip gloss they're called prismatic
lip glosses and I feel like that really
represents a way that the light bounces
off these when you wear them they just
catch the light from every single angle
they honestly do make it look like
you're they honestly do make you look
like you're enjoying the Rays of a
beautiful sunset even when you're just
in your flat in Clapham so if it can do
that to me then I am impressed and
that's it they are my absolute favorite
pieces from spring/summer launches from
a few of my favorite brands I really
hope you guys have enjoyed looking
through those with me I'm so excited to
start playing with them and really
getting to know the products so that I

in detail thoughts and reviews so keep
