much for joining me for the fourth
installment of the fashion mullet
spring edit I really hope you guys are
enjoying my spring videos so far I have
some luck creating all of the spring
content for you and today's video is
going to be my spring beauty launches so
I'm going to be talking through your few
products which either are launching or
has just launched throughout the spring
season and I'm particularly excited
about so this is more than edit then
from some of my January newing or my
Febrary new Beauty launches video is
more selective but there are I think 11
couldn't quite get a dance cam I'm
usually not going to chat about but yeah
so this is the latest video in the
fashion month of spring edit which if
you are only just tuning in you may not
know is a series of videos on creating
this week all based around spring and my
favorite season I'm doing fashion videos
like spring trends spring wardrobe
essentials and how to wear them as well
as drugstore makeup tutorials unboxings
hauls all that kind of stuff
so make sure you are subscribed if you
don't want to miss out on any of my
spring content ok if I'm going to get
straight stuck in there because I know
these videos can get a little bit long
and the first spring launch so I'm
really excited about is from a nail
brand and I definitely have ever
included a nail varnish in a new in
video before because you guys didn't
really do anything that different me
knows there's not normally that much
variation between no launches but now
things are doing something pretty cool
in that they are incorporating crystals
into their new launches and one of my
best friend Rory he lives in Hong Kong
and he came over you might remember this
conversation if you watched my progress
you can remember at Christmas and was
telling me about his latest obsession
which is crystals and how powerful they
are at changing kind of like your luck
you lose your energy level and the way
that you spoke about it got me so
excited about crystals and I'm still
looking out for a really good book to
educate myself on us if you know of any
let me know anyway I digress and the new
nails lien collection I've out
- these little gift boxes how the
crystal within it so this one has fallen
out but I think it was a rose quartz I
know it's very small hold on I think
it's got a really small way inside its
stomach so inside the gift set you get a
little crystal and if you know even less
about crystals an idea I'll tell you the
very small amount I do know basically
crystals have been in this universe
forever basically so they have these
curtains from wrong by the way and they
have managed to absorb a heck of a lot
of vibrations from the from the millions
of years they've been around so this
tiny bit of crystal is consistently
resonating out vibrations and these
vibrations impact our body because the
whole universe peer of the secrets is
made of our vibrations they're
incredibly powerful at bringing you
feelings of love bringing you lots menu
wealth bringing you good health so it's
really fascinating and if you're
interested in that then I think this is
a really lovely idea to some people it
may just be like of viral in saturation
but I think it's a really lovely idea
and they have infused the nail binders
with crystals so this one here is a
beautiful baby pink color and it's
infused with to treating the hope I'm
pronouncing there right it's got to
polar to shine to it which I guess is
the impact of the crystals and it says
wear me for happiness and heart
shielding so that is the power that
you're getting from the crystals within
it this one is a dark pink is almost
gold bronze tone to it and it says wear
me for stress free and positive energy
infused with tourmaline and I do
remember Rory talking about tourmaline
for stress so I'm going to put this one
on next not that I'm particularly
stressed at the moment but it's always
handy to ward off those stressful
vibrations my next box and comes with
aura enhancing rainbow top coats infused
with a clear quartz and then we're new
for friendship and love this is a pink
mark mindful manicure I mean this is so
at my street I just love this is infused
with rose quartz for friendship and
I think it's such an exciting launch I
think they've all got like a rose quartz
in them because very of course is the
prettiest but yeah rose quartz is for
friendship and love and I know actually
a lot of people that I didn't realize
before I start having conversations with
them but a lot of people either wear
rose quartz or they just have a rose
quartz in their handbag quickly in their
handbag or on our bedside table a lot of
people are starting to really get into
this and Rory my friends I mentioned
earlier he always knows trends like you
is he the buyer so this is why he's so
good he's so good his job because you
recognize his trends before he's become
a suit and you knew that crystals going
to be big so yeah really excited about
this I love the idea behind this the
mindful manicure just love it love it
love it love it
next up another mineral from the earth
villages on the clay detox washes from
L'Oreal so you probably have heard or
even tried the Loreal clay face mask in
my opinion fabulous face mask very
affordable and I think it's been quite
hard to get an affordable clay mask
that's really good until these guys came
out I just adore them and I'm very
intrigued to try the face water
versions so this is the red one so this
is cleansing writing and exfoliating
this is a glow scrub and then you've got
the pure clay detox wash the charcoal
one which is cleansing clarifying and
detoxifying pure play in the whites mud
which will cleanse purify and mattify
personally my skin needs all three of
these things if you guys have tried them
let me know because I'm extremely
excited about this launch is that
anywhere near is good for my skin and
face masks were then we are in for a
treat I'm a huge fan of John Frieda
blonde shampoo conditioner ranges
can't for the life of me remember the
name of the ranges before but you know
the ones a bit in like that champagne e
blonde colored packaging and then one
that's lightening there's animal yellowy
packaging both of those has been magical
for my hair so I'm really excited about
the lodge from John Frieda this is the
brilliant beat writer she had blonde
shampoo and conditioner and also
brilliantly brighter blonde perfecting
treatment which adds shimmery pearl
essence tones this sounds incredible and
really fast try it I hope it's as good
as it sounds cleanses and create a
shimmery pearl essence and at the moment
my hair is actually really struggling
for shine of course I've had it bleached
and also has been around holiday both of
which are pretty much the worst things
you can do for your hair so I'm going to
actually take these two to Charlie's
mom's house tonight because that's where
we're going as afternoon I'm going to
give them a try this evening and really
excited to see if they can add a little
bit more luminosity to my dry hair I do
believe that there is a brunette version
as well so leave both linked down in the
description box so you have already seen
me talking about these in my drugstore
makeup tutorial that was my second video
in the spring edit but these are new
from Renault they are the wake me up and
B fatigue foundation and concealer I
used to conceal it in a tutorial and I
am also a big fan of the foundation so
there seems to be a lot of buzz about
vitamin C at the moment because it's
really great especially this time of
year for adding some luminosity and some
radiance into the complexion we all need
that kind of foods to bitumens
into our skin and that's what they have
added especially in some new formulated
Whitney at foundation I'm always always
always a huge fan of Rimmel formulations
I think they pop pretty much every
high-end foundation I've ever tried this
one also has SPF 20 in it which is
fabulous as the Sun slowly but surely
starts to show its face it's nice to
have a little bit extra sun protection
but i would also use a moisturizer with
an SPF and you talked about one very
shortly but consistency wise these are
heavenly they just give you the most
beautiful glow such a natural healthy
glow particularly if you go slightly
lighter than your natural color in the
concealer I love it under your eye area
of actually going on right now and they
just feel so soft on the skin almost
spongy if that makes sense kind of like
the consistency that you get from the
cushion
Nations if you tried any of those it's a
skin brightening foundation anti fatigue
I am a few hundred soft beige in pretty
much all writable foundations in case
you're wondering yes new launch from
Rimmel fabulous drugstore foundation and
concealer
speaking of vitamin C we have a really
exciting new launch from Clinique and
this is very unusual very innovative and
really exciting so this is the fresh
pressed system from Clinique it's a
seven eight systems with pure vitamin C
so I just mentioned the benefits of
vitamin C and Clinique are taking it to
the next level with its little kit so
because the vitamin C within this is
quite personal
it is a seven-day kit you don't need to
worry about any active potent bitumens
going honey because you're messing use
this across a week and it should give
you a really fabulous luminous
complexion at the end of the seventh day
inside you get these some little sachets
and in here is a powdered vitamin C
formula so what you do is you have wet
hands and you pour some of this into
your hands and then you cleanse the face
with it it I thought it'd be exfoliating
but they're so fine and they kind of fit
away that you don't really get
exfoliation from it but you can really
feel it like tingling on the complexion
and the skin it does look and feel very
luminous afterwards
it's almost squeaky clean but it doesn't
feel stripped if that makes sense
your skin is will crave a bit of a
moisture hit afterwards and that's where
this comes in this also comes in the kit
it's the fresh pressed daily booster so
this you have like peel the top off to
allow the Erin to activate it
press it down give it a good old shake
and then apply on the skin almost like
you would apply a serum and then carry
on with the rest of the daily routine so
it makes the anti-aging as well but for
me it's more about that luminosity in
the radiance I get from using this come
to my second box already charlie also
got sent a box so um
this is my week two really good for
traveling so it's just so time you can
just pop a sachet and the booster in
your travel bag that's what I've been
doing recently also giving all my
instructors because I've been doing this
online
and storage in the morning so yeah cue
Maya next we have a product that I just
absolutely love using on a daily basis
it's a new mist and I just love face
mist you can get them ranging from very
affordable from like Primark and body
shop up to really high-end ones like
from Armani this one is kind of middle
ground but I love it it's from Elizabeth
Arden you get all the fabulous benefits
that we know and love from the eight
hour cream well there's not quite so
intense because it's the mist but yeah
it's basically an eight hour miracle
hydrating mist so if you just love that
feeling of refreshing your complexion in
the middle of the day perhaps you work
in office it's air-conditioned we work
in the city and you feel the pollution
like dragging the energy out of your
skin then you not try to mist yet I
highly recommend it
I was so excited when I open this up I
just adore the whole eight-hour
collection from Elizabeth Arden and
myths are just so easy to use you get
the benefit from them straight away
they're so refreshing especially as
temperatures so you would surely get a
bit warmer highly recommend and loving
using this so far so it's that time of
year when all of my favorite beauty
brands are bringing out their summer
collections and Clarence is one of them
I actually have a blog post coming up
all about the Clarins and summer
collection so I just wanted to talk
about one product in this video and it's
one that's a little bit different
so every year parents bring out a new
bronzer they bring out some new lip
colors and newly formulated foundations
by the way there are new pore minimizing
matte foundation so good but anyway I
always talk about this a little bit more
unusual this is a mattifying kit I love
it like is matte gold box and then
inside you have two options for
mattifying the skin if like me you start
to get the shine around two o'clock in
the afternoon and this is so good to
keep on your desk or in your handbags at
the top you've got a pressed powder and
it's almost like you're like a photo
powder you know the kind of powder where
it gives you like an airbrush finish
also comes with a sponge which is
seriously handy so you can just massif I
the skins using the powder
France or hearing underneath the sponge
you also have the can be removable
mattifying tissues so I love these and
they are so good especially if you don't
want to add anything else to your skin
those you don't want to risk taking up
your makeup with a powder then these
blotting papers are just fabulous I mean
from loving any excess shine
I love blotting papers but then I have
to say I also love affordable ones I get
along really well with the primark ones
but it's just so luxurious to have your
entire mattifying kit all in one place
in your handbag this is a really lovely
launched from Karen you've also got a
mirror in the mid here and it's really
fun really compact it's called the pool
perfecting mattifying kit so that's a
really fun new launch from time for
summer now we have a really exciting
knowledge from one of my favorite
skincare brands of all time it is
origins which is actually surprising
because this doesn't look very origins e
to me than about you but I was quite
surprised to see them using such bold
colors but finally origins who are my
go-to masked brand as you probably know
origins are finally bought out sheet
masks and I am a total fuck-up and sheet
mask craze of going on at the moment for
good reason because they are absolutely
epic
but origins have gone down at the flower
power root for their face mask they're
called these flower
fusions so these face masks there are
five different ones violet rose lavender
orange raspberry and jasmine all of them
have different benefits like softening
nourishing soothing hydrating radiant
boosting and refreshing and they are all
super hydrating and designed to bring
that beautiful radiance back to the skin
using the power of florals
so of course those single use marks as
with all sheet Mars and I hope I get
this right so basically they are made of
bamboo which is natural so it's not like
you're putting a sheet of plastic on
your face and and they are made with
flour wax which I think if I remember
correctly is the byproduct of extracting
essential oils so actually they're very
natural there
eco-friendly they are also recyclable
which makes me love them even more and
because they are made with these flower
extracts and essential oils they are
just such luxurious treat a lot more
aromatic I say not a vegetabie scented
than your average face mask it's just
exactly what I was expecting from an
origin sheet mask they're just sheet
marks but better they've got the origins
touch of magic about them and I love the
options I think that Nimmo we are skin
type every type of skin would benefit
from this kind of mask the masks are out
now they are 5 pounds each and yeah I'm
a big big fan so you've seen me a
gentleman from stories wearing these a
lot in the coming days and weeks this
next one is incredibly exciting
especially for MMS fans and those of us
who are addicted to the pro-collagen
marine creams because and I feel like
this is a fairly early announcement of
this the marine cream is coming out in
SPF 30 which for me is like hallelujah
because I love the marine cream but I
need to have SPF in my moisturizer when
I first heard as they were doing a
sketch I was like oh
SPF can ruin the consistency of
moisturizers but and this element they
have just done such a good job the
consistency of this is still that's
beautiful lightweight almost jelly
consistency that we know and love from
the marine creams if you've not tried
the cream before it's an absolute global
phenomenon I think one sells every 9
seconds across the world which is insane
considering at the higher end
moisturizer I think around the 80-pound
lot and but it's antiaging it's skin
smoothing it's just the most fabulous
consistency for time before your makeup
absolutely adore the marine cream so I'm
just going to read off the press reads
because this is where it gets a little
bit technical and I don't want to get
any of this wrong it says that the
marine cream SPF 30 has micronized Sun
cream which basically means that the
particles and SPF which is usually
unused easy protection when they are
applied onto the skins they basically
expand which gives you a more even
covering of the SPF which is incredibly
important it contains
Billo bucks which is reputed to help
contract free radical activity amazing
if you live in the city like I do so
they have a protective effects on
collagen five minutes for preventing the
signs of aging and wrinkles and everyday
stresses on the skin it's also got
clothes for Ella chlorella chlorella it
basically got all the benefits of the
traditional marine cream plus that SPF
30 so it goes out saying that
immediately this is been switched into
my daily routine I've just been loving
using it the consistency is gorgeous the
results are instantaneous
I think it's within seven days that you
have like visibly reduce wrinkles and
way around my eyes is concerned to me so
really excited about this new launch in
case you can already tell and moving
back to makeup this incredibly bright
makeup bag is from Bobbi Brown they have
launched tests on the collection and I
am in love with so many of these pieces
so first of all ones that I'm really
exciting about are these two there is a
long wear shadow stick so this has got
to incredibly wearable shades in it I
just adore cream stick eyeshadows I find
it so easy to apply so easy to blend and
Bobbi Brown have hit the nail on the
head as usual when it comes to colors
this is toast
and peach mimosa if you like me that
loves a very natural brown eye then this
is absolutely your go-to and number two
in one as well like who says Mike do you
ever gets awesome an eyeshadow stick I
definitely don't we've also got the
peach cheek palette in this almost
garish and neon pink which I don't know
if I like it or load it haven't yet
decided either way it will definitely
not go missing in my nature drawer
inside you've got a gorgeous selection
of product I feel like you could use
these a contour or highlight because you
have a bit of shimmer but it's the blush
shade that I absolutely adore
I find Bobby Brown blush is always so
flattering you really do get what you
pay for with these they are a little bit
more pricey than other blushes that are
in my collection I love them the color
payoff is spectacular and the packaging
is cute
you've got the mirror in the lid as well
and then another notch from Bobbi Brown
which I can't quite decide if
like or not so these are the art sticks
in the liquid formula so I previously
have been to Shannon the art states they
are kind of like a crayon and they have
this beautiful color selection they pour
them out in liquid and they look like
this you have to squeeze it to get the
color out feels a little bit childish in
some way there we know a little bit kind
of I guess like an arbor and maybe
that's where the name comes from this is
my favorite shade this is liquid lip in
Havana coral and does that move as well
I just don't know about the consistency
because when you put them on they are
fabulous color payoff it really is and
we shouldn't have lipstick on now and
then I show you
and maybe I'll insert the picture here
of a swatch on my hand but the color
payoff is fabulous but there's just do a
little bit too sticky I'm I say this
having got gloss on my lips right now
but I'm not really a glossy lip lover I
prefer a matte lip I don't really like
to feel anything on my lips and this
formula is quite thick and you can most
definitely feel that it's there so I get
to take some getting used to but I'm
determined to stick with it because I
love the colors of these so I'll keep
you updated as to how I get along with
them and then last but not least we had
a skincare range launched from quarterly
they're totally I've been using for so
many years at the in love any launches
they always seem to really work so this
one definitely call my eyes because it
is designed with urban skin in mind it's
design active and this one is the
three-in-one moisturizer
anti-pollution anti-wrinkle and gives
you a healthy glow with hyaluronic acid
vitamins E and C and antioxidants
polyphenols again pronunciations so this
one is the 3:1 moisturizer you've got a
glow activating and you wrinkle serum
and also an overnight detox oil as you
can see from the packaging I've not
tried this range yet but I want to
conclude it because I trust cordially to
continually bring out fabulous products
and I have really really high hopes for
this range I love that it's focused on
city dwellers like myself and I'm very
much aware of the damage of pollution on
my skin and anything that
comes out that is kind of thing to
refuse that I'm really excited about and
that is everything the spring and beauty
launches that I'm most excited about let
me know in the comments below if you
have any videos that you're really
excited about or any others that you've
heard about on the grapevine that you're
really excited about or if you've tried
a Newsies and you have words of wisdom
