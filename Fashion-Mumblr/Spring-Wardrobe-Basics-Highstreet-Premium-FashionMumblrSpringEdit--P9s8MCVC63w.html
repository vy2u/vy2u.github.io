having a fabulous week and are enjoying
the dashing and alert spring edit so
fast so in case you've just stumbled
upon this video you might be wondering
what the fashions of spring edit is well
basically every single day this week I'm
bringing you a new spring themed video
with the beauty or fashion or lifestyle
they are all coming into my channel this
week so make sure you subscribe if you
do not want to miss any of the upcoming
videos I will use the ones which have
gone live so far linked down below we've
had a sorrowful and also a drugstore
makeup tutorials so definitely go and
check those out and keep an eye out for
the upcoming videos today's video I'm
really excited about the actually songs
won last year as well and it went down
so well I thought I would read it for
2017 and it's going to be my spring
wardrobe basics so these are pieces you
can have in your wardrobe that really
helps you to put together your outfit
throughout the season of spring and also
it's all my time too I like to think of
these as my outfit building blocks I can
always go to them and rely on them to
help me build any outfit for the
upcoming on because I do get a lot of
use out of these pieces I sometimes like
to invest a little bit more so the most
of these pieces I have got a high street
version and then also wants a little bit
more expensive like a premium high
street piece because I really do like to
invest in these pieces because to me
quality basics is a really important
thing to have in your wardrobe
as with all my fashion videos and beauty
as well everything that I mentioned will
be linked down below so make sure to
open up the description box for links as
well as links to blog posts links for
wearing in the video etc etc so
definitely check out the description box
for lots more information so I'm going
to get started with my first core piece
within a spring water and is a white
silky desk top I've got a premium
version and then also two more
affordable versions from the high street
so my premium version is from reefs I
tend to buy their white silky top every
year they bring out
very similar style every single year and
very few design details have changed
having said that you could really invest
in one and wear it year after unix the
quality really is so fabulous this one
is a really beautiful it's actually
polyester which just means that it wears
a lot better it washes more easily but
it has an incredibly silky feel it's got
some design details around the armholes
you've got like a lettering effect and
then at the back it's got a beautiful
button-down detail so really elegant the
fabric just has a beautiful hangs with
so this touched into a high-waisted
skirt a beautiful chain a pair of
trousers really just makes you look so
sophisticated so feminine and it just a
key essential piece to have in your
wardrobe this type of top I get so much
wear out of so I'm very happy to invest
in a slightly more luxurious version
this one I believe is just under a
hundred pounds it's definitely not cheap
but then when you consider price per
wear I really don't mind too much
spending that amount of money on some
things I'm going to get so much use out
of these two tops my Topshop and River
Island are both very very similar these
are more of a strappy style I tend to
wear these throughout all of the warmer
months I take them on all my holidays
with me because they really do crunch
down into a very small size and they're
just very plain strap shops
these ones are last year's style I don't
think they fall out this year style just
yet and but I will be investing in a
couple more when they do the Topshop one
is a little bit thicker it's actually a
double laid you've got a slightly more
sheer layer over the top whereas the
river Eiling one is just as one a single
layer so many outfits work with you use
whether it's short skirts even wearing
them underneath the belt for a little
bit more modesty I remember last spring
and last summer I got so much use out of
these kind of tops so I sort of include
them as part of my basics next up is a
lightweight jumper and you probably see
me wearing this so so much because I
absolutely love it so this one picks up
so many of the spring trends as well is
cold shoulder
it's got ruffle details and it's pink so
it really does tick so many boxes for
the spring 2017 trends this one is from
Club Monaco but I do believe that hmm
actually has an exact dupe of this I've
not seen it in real life so I'm not too
sure on the quality I'm going to try and
find it and I'll leave it linked down
below that actually do not have a high
speed version of this jump
but there's one other to Club Monaco so
I think you look around and in 40 pounds
which is a lot for jumpers but when you
find a piece and you just absolutely
fall in love with it like Isis with this
one then it wasn't too painful partying
without much money and I was determined
to get a lot of youth outfit and so far
I have done so no regrets when it comes
to buying this jumper I definitely think
it's worth spending a little bit of time
to find a lightweight freeing jumper
that you know you can just throw on for
multiple occasions in springtime for me
it's this one that there are also so
many gorgeous ones from Rhys Yaga have
got some Reed to the lightweight knits
and then also Topshop and river islands
and my go-to as well as this one is
super versatile it's a very casual
fabric and yet the detail on it means
that it can be dressed up or down you've
got this embroidery kind of lace detail
at the top here and have also echoed on
the hem of the sleeve I just think it's
so beautiful it's incredibly comfortable
but it looks elegant chic sophisticated
I just am so so pleased by pick this one
up so I'll leave this on link down below
and if I can find any other high street
versions or high street day dresses I
also love unleash those links down below
as well
next up feel spring wardrobe basics I
would definitely recommend investing in
a lightweight coat
I say investing because I feel that
coats the quality really does show when
you spend out a little bit more and also
it's the part of your outfit that makes
the biggest statement and that people
see the most off so I prefer to spend a
little bit more online elsewhere so that
reason that my first spring basic coat
is this beautiful one from Reese
I wore this during London Fashion Week
and I got so many compliments it really
is the most stunning style the materials
got a beautiful Sheen to it thanks the
silky fabric composition and it's at the
most beautiful silhouette you've got
this sash belt sloping shoulders so
incredibly flattering and then it's got
a very plain neckline so you can add
some accessories you can wear polo net
you can wear I don't know you can really
go to challenge new this because as much
as it's a beautiful material it's also
very plain it's so incredibly versatile
this color is super flattering also very
much on trend this season it's like a
muted purpley pinky great so flattering
on many many skin tones I'm going to
leave me
below my fashion week water war video
because then you can see this one in
action it really did look stunning with
all the outfits I've had it with so
definitely go and check that video out
next I'm actually yet to invest in a
lightweight high street coat for this
year but I wanted to show you my running
coat from last year because I got so
many questions about this last year and
I'm pretty sure they will bring out to
2017 version so this is a very
lightweight trench coat it doesn't even
have a lining it just as one simple
layer of fabric which give it the most
beautiful hang and drape it's got turned
up colors it's got this cake detail at
the back once again it's got a waist
belt so you can really style this up or
down you can tie it up you can leave it
hanging loose and it's just a lovely way
to add a little bit of warmth to your
outfit but without adding too much
fabric Topshop also tends to bring out
coats very similar to this each and
every year in fact I think they've
already bought out ones very similar
this year so once again I'll leave that
links down below
and any that I can find it as soon as do
this I will also need to Footwear wise I
think it's really nice to have a pair of
non black ankle boots in your spring
wardrobe
these ones are River islands that there
are suede like material and then they've
got this silver buckle I feel say that
so high-end you definitely would not be
able to tell do the river island and the
heel height is absolute perfect to me
it's a couple of inches so it gives you
a little bit of a boost but still very
wearable and comfortable for all day
long and then on the premium end of the
high street I have disappeared from
wreaths these are very much remind me of
Chloe boots I think they look incredibly
designer and the color is so versatile I
love the pair beads and the River Rhine
ones with white jeans with in miniskirts
with day dresses even because they are a
little bit more skin tone colored
they're very leg lengthening very
flattering and once given heel height
means they're incredibly comfortable so
it's great to add a height but
especially if you want to wear them all
day long thinking of white jeans I
definitely think that having a pair in
your spring wardrobe is great basic
because if you like to buy any silk
blouses any gray pink basically any
color top jumper desktop will go with a
pair of white jeans so spend some time
going through the different high street
stores and find out which store has the
best fit for you personally I love River
Islands and Niue
look I finally have a really good
elastic content which means they fit
beautifully this is actually a new look
pair they are incredibly affordable and
they've washed very very well they still
look brand-new and they've also got this
ragged hem detail at the bottom which
sometimes I like because it just looks a
little bit more edgy but if I don't want
to have it then I simply turn the hems
up and you can no longer see it which
gives them a little bit more of a plane
effect and that might ask your wardrobe
Asics are also accessories firstly a
pair of flat shoes your incredibly
comfortable with I've chosen a pair of
mules because they are as you know very
much in style this spring this is a pink
pair I'm yet to wear them you're 50
pounds so not too cheap but they're from
River eyes they are a high street
version but these are the stochastic
that they look a little bit bluish but
they're not trying to be the Gucci ones
and they've got a lovely spongy padded
soles which should be very comfortable
this color is just so me I can see
myself wearing these with so many
different outfit combinations and I
don't think the mule trend is going
anywhere so a really good watering
staple you may also spotted these in
some recent videos and also in a lot of
my travel photos these are a new
investment communities my Nicholas
Kirkwood shoes these were I think around
the 400 Cal mark so Japanese not as
affordable as River Island ones but once
again I've already been used so much for
incredibly comfortable I love how they
look and I've worn them so much the
price for wear is getting better and
better every single day pretty much and
I think that having a pair of flats in
your wardrobe that you know looks great
so many outfits you can easily slip on
and go is a really great basic to house
last but not least is a pastel colored
handbag casual accessories are a great
way of adding some of the on-trend
colors in pure waters but without
investing in a whole new water to tiny
so I've chosen this bag from mango I
really never style I think it looks
incredibly high end it's surprisingly
spacious you can fit quite a lot in here
and yet it still is floor and chic to
hang on your arms mango has got some
really good stuff in at the moment in
fact I bought quite a lot from there
recently so it definitely keeps an eye
on upcoming vlogs etc to see what else I
had picked up so those aren't my spring
wardrobe basics I would love to know
what your basics are I know these are
very much to my style but hopefully they
are to yours as well
but let me know what you've picked up
recently for your three core jokes I'd
love know what you guys are investing in
as well thank you so much for watching
do give this video a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in my
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
