channel today's video is going to be all
about spring fashion trends and in
particular 10 of my favorites springtime
fashion essentials these are going to be
the types of things that I feel like if
you have in your wardrobe then it'll
make it a lot easier for you to pull
together like over everyday outfits and
just look and feel fabulous throughout
spring time the pieces I'm going to show
you other pieces that I have in my own
wardrobe but of course you don't need to
buy the exact same ones just something
similar and this is really just to give
you a guideline of the kind of things
that will help people don't have spring
wardrobe in this video is also part of
the fashion mumbler
spring edit so hopefully you guys have
been enjoying my edits so far you might
have seen my spring everyday drugstore
makeup tutorial if you haven't I will
leave that link down below and make sure
you are subscribed if you don't want to
miss any of my spring edit videos or any
of my videos for that matter so I'm
going to kick things off with a lovely
plain white blouse now for me white is
just such an essential color to have in
your spring water because it really
freshens up any outfit this blouse in
particular is a really lovely shape it's
very relaxed and it's got a beautiful
bow detail at the top here it's just
goose it and lovely feminine touch I
find that I wear this with jeans with
embroidered skirts with floral trousers
because it's such a neutral color it
really does go with so many things and I
find myself reaching for this on so many
different occasions throughout
springtime my next spring wardrobe
essential is the shirt dress and this is
a lovely one which I picked up from
Topshop I really love the fit of this
one it's a very relaxed meaning you can
just stick it on if you're going out
shopping with friends or even for a work
meeting because the style of it can be
quite smart as well I love the waistband
on this in particular it gives it a
really lovely flattering shape and if
you'd like to see how I style this up
from the blog I'll leave a link to an
outfit post down below where I wore this
the post is actually all about how to up
your Instagram fashion game but I'm
wearing this and the photos are really
lovely so definitely go and check that
one out I think your shirt dress is such
lovely springtime essential you can pick
them up on the high street we're really
not too much money and I've already
surprised myself by how many times I
have worn this throughout the early
spring days while those two are quite
cool pieces in your wardrobe this is
more trend led and it's an
off-the-shoulder lace top so we're
seeing these we sold them on the Louie
Vuitton catwalk on the Gucci catwalk so
many places throughout Fashion Week and
it's already filtered down to the high
street this is the one that I've chosen
for this video although I have to say
I've picked up quite a few for my spring
wardrobe I really like the shape of this
one it wasn't too expensive at all this
one's actually from hmm and it's a
lovely lace material I believe it was
only around 14 pounds as well which is
yeah $12.99 so a really good bargain I
think when you're going to buy into
trends it's okay to go slightly cheaper
whereas if this was a more cool piece
like the two pieces before a little bit
more pricey
whereas this you never know if this is
going to be in trend next year or not so
nice to pick up a bit of a fashion
bargain but this I would love to wear
with high-waisted trousers and maybe a
suede skirt and I think it's a really
lovely way of adding that boho chic
trend into your spring wardrobe my next
spring essential is a lovely trench coat
and you guys know how much I love pink
and neutrals so no surprise I have gone
for a beautiful pink one trench coats
are such a timeless item to have in your
wardrobe they never go out of fashion
season after season so it's really worth
investing in a lovely trench coat
although having said that the High
Street has so many incredible options
this one was from Topshop and I
absolutely love it it's got so many nice
design details you've got the buckles on
the sleeves
you've got the lovely kind of
tortoiseshell style buttons and it's
just a really lovely shape with this
Cape style detail at the back and say
it's definitely worth trying on a few
different colors a few different fits to
make sure you find the one that's right
for you because honestly you will not
stop wearing this in springtime it is
such a wardrobe staple
this next one is actually quite the
recent addition to my wardrobe but I can
already see myself getting so much wear
out of this and as part of my spring
fashion essentials I'd say that a lovely
summery day dress has definitely got to
be up there in my top 10 a lovely
classic day dress like this one is such
an easy piece to throw on no matter what
you're doing it can be dressed up or
dress down whether with sandals or with
high heels and I think if you go again
for a neutral color then it's bound to
slot in really easily with your wardrobe
whether you've already bought some
spring accessories or just to go with
things you have from previous seasons a
neutral color like this one it will slot
in so easily to your wardrobe this one
in particular I absolutely love for the
gorgeous collar detail it's very preppy
and feminine and then the actual detail
of material is like a scholar to lace
and such a flattering design with a
lovely structured bodice
there's no boning in there are anything
but it has been cut really beautifully a
cinched in waist with a waistband and
then a fit-and-flare design at the
bottom so such a beautiful elegant and
feminine shape next up is a pair of
floral trousers now you might recognize
these from my Fashion Week diary I
posted a couple of outfit of the days
wearing these over on my blog again
which I'll link down below to give you
some styling ideas but I believe that a
pair of floral trousers is such a lovely
spring water essential this pair is
really gorgeous they're a beautiful
almost linen like material which makes
them quite smart they would look really
beautiful with that very first white top
that I showed you in fact I think that's
what I wore at Fashion Week also these
are high-waisted so again very elegant
very feminine design I think that floral
trousers and a lovely neutral top is
such an easy go to outfit idea for
springtime if I'm ever rushing or stuck
the time I just want to look really
lovely feminine
and still quite smart they're not always
reach for floral trousers and maybe a
white silk t-shirt or even as I said
that top that I showed you at the
beginning of this video if that started
Francis isn't quite your thing then how
about a pair of floral jeans this pair
is several years old I picked these up
when I used to work at Reese and I still
wear them to this day because they are
black and white or gray and white they
just slopped so easily into my wardrobe
if ever you're trying to fit a trend
into your wardrobe and always go for
neutrals or monochrome because you'll
find that color wise it'll slot in much
more easily and that's why I still three
or four years later I'm still loving
these trousers as the weather starts to
warm up I think it's really lovely to
have an embroidered skirt or just a
really pretty girly skirt in your
wardrobe it doesn't have to be
embroidered maybe you like a floral
skirt or two remember last year the
trend for those scalloped edge skirts
which I absolutely love
this one it just kills two birds one
stone it's embroidered and it's got the
lovely scalloped bottom I wore this so
much last spring and summer and it
always came with me on holidays and is
coming with me to South Africa as well
this was a little bit of an investment
piece I got this from Club Monaco but
the price per wear for this skirt has
been so fantastic as I said I wore it so
much last year and I'm excited start
wearing it again this year again with a
lovely white t-shirt to dress it down or
maybe a white silk camisole to dress it
up another piece that you'll find
yourself reaching before over and over
again is a plain camisole top I've
picked this one up in light blue but
I've also got it in baby pink and white
as well and already I've worn the white
one at least ten times in the two weeks
that I've had it I've worn it so so so
much and you're looking for a camisole
choose something that will very easily
fit in color wise with the rest of your
wardrobes you guys know I love my
pastels I love my neutrals so it's no
surprise that I picked up a selection of
pastel colors
this one in particular is really
beautiful it's a lovely light material
almost quite silky but it's not it's
much easier to care for than silk and
it's got some nice strap detail as well
instead of just a plain strap it's got
two separate straps at the back and this
is available right now from Topshop I'll
leave a link down below to this exact
one and I highly recommend getting at
least one color option of this and
honestly it will go with so many outfit
combinations this time and finally
clothing wise possibly my most worn item
throughout the whole of spring and
summer is a pair of classic well fitting
white jeanss now it's worth spending a
little bit of time trying on a few
different pairs of jeans from a few
different stores to figure out what
style suits you best and that you're
most comfortable in for me it's a slim
fitting pair of high-waisted jeans that
aren't you long these ones are from
River Island which I find is best for
petite and they have a lovely raw edge
on the bottom which means that they're
quite crops so they look good whether
I'm wearing flat shoes heels sandals or
wedges any type of footwear white jeans
you can really be more adventurous with
the top that you're wearing if you're
bored of me mentioning white coloured
cells and things like that then you'll
be pleased to know that so many
different colors in fact every color
goes beautifully with a pair of lovely
white jeans and to finish off I wanted
to talk about a couple of accessories no
surprise one of my favourite spring
essentials for this year is going to be
Mikey Australia at sunglasses I've been
going on and on about these I love them
so much and I definitely would recommend
spending again a little bit of time
trying on a few different pairs of
sunglasses order a few from ASOS
especially Kier I think there's such
good quality and brilliant price tag
these I believe were definitely under 30
pounds so really good quality sunglasses
they do make a statement but without
being too crazy and I think I'm going to
be getting a lot more wear out of these
this springtime and last but absolutely
not least is a pair of neutral easy to
wear heeled sandals so these are
actually last season's I got these from
June but I will try to link up some
similar options
right now down below last spring and
summer I wore these so much they were
without a doubt my most woman pair of
shoes the heel how it means they're just
about walkable for an entire day without
making my legs too sore and the chunky
heel makes them very easy to walk in as
well an ankle strap is always a good
thing to look out for if you want
something that's going to stay in place
on your foot and not make you trip over
and because they're open toe they're
just very flattering leg lengthening and
also just make any outfit got a very
sleek make your legs are elongated and
just really really beautiful and that's
it for my top ten spring with fashion
wardrobe essentials I hope this video
