spring morning routine my day usually
starts around half seven or eight lots
of kisses from my favorite little man
and then I reach my phone and check a
few social media sites like Instagram
snapchat Twitter Facebook and my emails
we've all getting out of bed I pop on my
incredibly comfy inu slippers and then I
give my little man a few more kisses
before making the bed usually to fair
Charlie makes the bed but I was last out
of bed this morning so it was my job
then I wash my hands with this gorgeous
smelling molten Brown soap before giving
my face a quick wash with some nice
little water just to freshen myself up a
little bit then I go and open the window
let some fresh air in it's so nice to
feel that spring morning breeze before
heading downstairs to make myself a nice
cup of tea I've really been enjoying
this loose leaf tea recently I've got it
from a brand called tea too and I just
love using this little strainer it's so
cute and the tea is really tasty and
nice and fresh with the rose in there as
well
so I leave that to brew for a little bit
before making my way into the lounge
where Dexter is already waiting for me
on the sofa I grab my laptop and then
usually reply to some YouTube comments
check my subscriber count rather
obsessively look at my blog post reply
to any comments all while slapping my
tea if it's a nice day sometimes I'll
head outside and just sit in the garden
enjoying the fresh air with my little
boy who loves to sunbathe and just enjoy
the rest of my tea outside then it's on
with my gym kit get myself ready to do a
little workout sometimes I'll go to the
gym but this morning a little bit short
on time so I'm just going to do an
at-home workout just tying my hair back
ready to get started
so I had downstairs guess who's waiting
for me and then I'm using an app called
seven-minute workout I think it's called
and it's really good for just burning a
few calories and getting your heart rate
up at home texture loves it when I do
these exercises he always likes to try
and get involved helping mummy out as
you can see and after about 15 or 20
minutes of exercise that's me done for
the morning and I then head into the
kitchen and make myself a really lovely
breakfast smoothie with strawberries
raspberries and some frozen blueberries
as well as some vanilla milk some honey
some chia seeds and I blend it all up in
my magical of thermomix then I pour it
into my incredibly instagram bell jar
mug and pop on the lid and my little
bamboo paper straw and we're ready to go
next is upstairs and into the shower
where currently I'm obsessed with this
Neal's Yard rose body wash it smells so
good I can't even tell you how amazing
it is then sticking with the Rose stream
I'm using a new cleansing oil and serum
from a brand called votary
I think that's how you pronounce it from
Liberty and this just feels so heavenly
on the skin so this is really my weekend
pamper facial routine wash it off with a
hot cloth
and then I use the matching serum also
rose-scented
honestly the best smelling skincare
you've ever smelled Pat that into my
skin and then on to teeth brushing this
is a very realistic morning routine
isn't it and then I use a bit of
mouthwash as well just to keep my teeth
nice and white and fresh breath then
this is the fun bit
I always keep lots of new Beauty
launches in this box and the weekends I
love to try out some new things so I'm
just pulling a few new pieces out of my
goodie box and see what I'm going to
play with this morning at the moment I'm
really loving this new eye serum from
Liz Earle it's that super skin eye serum
really been enjoying using that recently
and I'm also going to trying out some
new skin booster drops from Clarins so
I'm mixing it in with my usual day
moisturizer which is the Clarins multi
active so you can see I'm just putting a
few drops in and then mixing it in with
my moisturizer and it just gives it lots
of extra skin care benefits and patting
that onto my face
then I'm going to be trying out a new
primer from bareMinerals
this one is really good if you suffer
from the odd blemish because it's got
their blemish remedy complex in it just
smoothing that all over my face and then
trying a new foundation from Estee
Lauder well this is new to me it's their
Double Wear foundation and I love it so
far really lovely coverage I'm also
using the matching concealer again from
Estee Lauder Double Wear just patting
that onto my under eye area and then
using my finger to blend that in
followed by mine on Beautyblender
Beautyblender then I'm using my it
cosmetics brow power just to fill in my
brows I'm not doing terribly heavy
makeup today just trying out some new
pieces then look at this gorgeous
Elizabeth Arden packaging as part of the
summer range I'm using that eyeshadow
palette the lighter shade from that you
can see just dabbing my lovely zoeva
rose golden brush in it I'm also using
Neela's with Arden sunset from so this
just gives such a lovely glow especially
when I feel like my skin's a little bit
dull so it has a few shimmery particles
in it then I'm using a zoeva contour
palette this has got a really beautiful
very soft brown contour shade and a
beautiful blush color as well I decided
I needed a bit more definition on my
eyes going in with one of the Clinique
are shadows
and then I'm using my favorite eyeliner
which is the Tom Ford eyeliner
next I curl my lashes and apply my
Rimmel volume colorist I think it's
called mascara and then I'm going back
into some it cosmetics powder just to
set my under eye makeup and anywhere
where my makeup tends to run away then
I'm trying out another new launch these
are the Burberry I think they called the
full kisses lipsticks I just love them
the texture is so gorgeous I've been
wearing them non-stop since I filmed
this video and that's pretty much the
finishing touch
so my weekend makeup is done nothing too
heavy next I go to my wardrobe decide
where I'm going to wear and look at that
magically got changed into a nice little
lace top and some lilac trousers next is
on to the hair and I'm using some new
fabulous straighteners which I'm trying
out very impressed so far they have a
snazzy technology in them which means
that it kind of tells how dry your hair
is and how much heat is required don't
ask me how it works but it's pretty
amazing so I'm giving my hair some light
curls just using the straighteners and
they've got nice rounded barrels to them
so it gives really beautiful curls just
repeating this all the way around my
head I do have a video for how I do my
hair if you want to see this in more
detail
I finish off with a little bit of
hairspray if I need to and then some
lovely Gucci perfume at the moment I'm
really loving their bamboo perfume pop
my sunglasses on my head and we're
pretty much ready to go so I grabbed my
Radley backpack and it's out the door we
go literally looks like I'm walking into
heaven and here's my finished outfit my
wedges which you just saw there are by
ugh my top is by Karen Millen and
trousers are from ASOS you probably
recognize my radley backpack and that is
the finished look I really hope you guys
have enjoyed this video and I'll see you
in my next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
