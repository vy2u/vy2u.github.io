video for vloggers I hope you guys have
been enjoying my regular video uploads
and have been enjoying the videos so far
today I thought I would do a more summer
related video we have been thankfully
blessed finally with some beautiful
weather this weekend is due to be
absolutely gorgeous and so to celebrate
I thought I would share with you a few
summer related Beauty tricks I'm not
gonna say hacks because they're not as
like quirky as hacks there are more
things that I do on a really regular
basis but I feel like not everybody does
and I I kind of take them for granted
they're like my everyday beauty tips and
I thought I would share them with you so
that's what today's video is going to be
all about of course I'm filming this
video and publishing it in summer but
actually when I think about it a lot of
these hacks I do use all year round so
hopefully there's going to be some
really useful beauty tips in this video
so without further ado let's get started
my first tips are all to do with shaving
your legs it's this time of year or
actually a little bit earlier that we
all start to get our legs out for the
first time and it can be a little bit
nerve-wracking and personally I've
actually been using laser hair removal
for quite a long time
I have been doing a few blog posts about
it but if you know how laser hair
removal works you basically have to
shave your legs while you are in the
process of it so I haven't shaved my
legs every other day pretty much to keep
them silky smooth and hair free but I
have been spending an absolute fortune
on races and to be honest I'm so lazy
that most of the time my razors kind of
sit in the shower the razor heads
themselves are getting rusty
which is giving me actually it's given
me a few cuts but also it's just not
good for your legs as bacteria acrobats
so when I heard about a new company
called friction free shaving which is
like a monthly subscription box
containing a razor and razor heads that
basically means that you have a new
razor head all the time I was convinced
for very very quickly so I have my first
Fox here although it has been
slightly chewed by a little certain
fluffy sausage dog shaped animal so this
is what my first box came with I chose
the Samantha raiser which is quite
snazzy one and it's kind of rose gold
and orange it looks very looks very
sturdy and good quality and it is and
also in the box I have got four
obviously there's three there one on my
razor head four replaceable razor blades
and why this is so good for summer and
any time of year is that it means that
you always are prompted to change your
razor head if like me you often forget
and you finally you using an old head
that is not cutting your hair very close
to the skin or it's just you know full
of bacteria and gross then this is a
really really useful thing to sign up to
it works out as little as three pound
ago so a lot cheaper than buying the
regular raises that you can buy in the
store so I found that these razor head
are incredibly good quality just
incredibly convenient and it means that
I'm always on top of keeping my legs
hair free which is wonderful I also have
a few other tips when it comes to
shaving and the first tip for a really
close shave as well as the all-important
regularly replaced razor head is to use
exfoliating gloves now what I like to do
everytime my shower is I put on my
exfoliating gloves and I brush my legs
upwards from foot up towards the knee to
really raise the hairs and this means
that every single hair is caught so my
legs are so silky smooth I love to of
course exfoliate my legs as well and for
that I use exfoliating gloves and you
guessed it my favorite soft and gentle
in the shower mousse so this is suitable
for all body types you can use it on
your diddly-doo door and just everywhere
and its irritation free etc except etc
Iran what about this a lot so you know
how much I love it but it's a moose and
a foamy kind of expanding moose so makes
for a really good shaving foam so
combined this is basically a winning
shaving combination so friction free
shaving really a lot cheaper than
continue buying new razors your shave is
a lot closer your legs are a lot
smoother because you're regularly
replacing your shaver heads so that is
my first tip for silky smooth legs
cheering summer next when it comes to
having perfect legs throughout the
summer months my next tip is involving
your tanning routine so personally I
love to beat and at the moment I'm lucky
I'm fairly tan thanks to a few hard days
I've been on recently but it's coming to
the stage where my natural tan is
starting to fade so I'm already jumping
back on the gradual tan bandwagon but if
you haven't been on your Sun holiday yet
and you're starting to get your limbs
out for the first time then you're
probably going to want to add some
gradual tan into your routine as well
because it's such a lovely way of
naturally building up a very believable
looking tan recently I've been trying
out the Palmer's cocoa butter natural
bronze gradual tan moisturizer this is a
really easy and cheap one to use it's
very very good one for the price that it
is it's available on the high street
I'll leave the links down below but with
regards to drugstore body tanners this
is by far the best one that I've tried I
love cocoa butter as a whole I just
think the brand is the fabulous there's
nothing that I haven't loved that I've
tried from them and this is no exception
last summer and spring this year I use
the natural bronze body lotion but this
is a spray version I still rub it in
with my hands but it just makes it so
easy that it just sprays out the can and
the color so many people ask me if my
tan is real it is but it's topped up
with this and I will definitely be
continuing using this into the autumn
months to maintain that summer color so
my tip number two is to use a gradual
tan in place of your normal moisturizer
when you get out of the shower to start
working on that gorgeous bronze color
not all of my tips are necessary beauty
related this one is kind of it is some
kind of is a hack but this tip is
something I actually use quite a lot
I've never I think I've ever even told
anyone let alone shedding online I use
dry shampoo to keep my shoes smelling
nice yes you heard it here first I take
a dry shampoo not one of these posh ones
just a good old batiste is good enough
and I spray it in my trainers after I
have been out in them for the day and it
gets rid of the smell I don't know how
it works I guess the same way that it
does in your hair it just absorbs any
nasty odorous particles it probably
isn't the best thing to do on like a
long-term basis but all I know is that
it keeps my trainers from getting smelly
when I wear them even during the day
straight after I take them off they
smell absolutely lovely this is just the
original one I think everybody knows if
it smells like and it sure as heck
smells a lot better than my untreated
trainers so there's a really quick tip
and something that you can do if you do
suffer from smelly summer shoes I
absolutely love wearing nail varnish all
year round but in the summer months I
sometimes find that when I apply it it
goes a little bit bubbly under the
surface and I cannot stand imperfect
nails so this really really bugs me and
recently while I was on holiday and I
was actually complaining about these
bubbles someone told me that it's
because my nail varnish when it was
going onto my nails was too warm so if
he finds the of nail varnish is not
going on so smoothly during these warm
months try putting your nail varnish in
the fridge and by cooling down at the
temperature of your nap I shall become a
lot smoother and you won't notice he's
fine under the surface bubbles in your
nail varnish when it comes to polish at
the moment I'm obsessed with these new
ones from Marc Jacobs they are the
resurrection enamoured nail lacquers and
I've got this in baby pink and also in
white personally I find light colors
really accentuate your tan and white on
the toes is such a classic color goes
with everything pink on the fingernails
of many drops in pink on the fingernails
it's just
absolutely beautiful so feminine so
classy and it just looks fabulous no
matter what you're wearing so I've been
keeping my now I'm going to shoes in the
fridge for that perfect smooth
application every single time something
else that's really really easy but very
impactful is to use a makeup setting
spray I think it was really last summer
that I started to use makeup setting
sprays but this summer I would not dream
of going a full day out the house
without using one current favorite is
the Estee Lauder set and refresh it's a
two in one I use it in the morning after
applied my makeup to set it and then it
can be also used in the afternoon or
early evening to really refresh your
makeup and that's not refreshing as in
like it's cooling although it is
refreshing in that way too
but really it kind of gives your makeup
a couple more hours of looking good so
if you ever get a little bit tired and
your skin starts look dull in the
afternoon especially in the summer with
central heating and just warm air your
skin can look a little bit tired but by
using a sprays such as this it really
helps to lift up the complexion giving
you a few more hours of beautiful
glowing makeup so setting your makeup
first thing in the morning and then
refreshing it throughout the day is a
really good habit to get into in summer
months and this is my favorite to do so
my next tip is a really obvious one and
this is something that I'm still working
on myself because I don't know why but I
find it really hard to keep hydrated in
summer and all year round but what I
have found is that by using a slightly
more exciting water bottle I'm far more
likely to keep hydrated so this is a bkr
water bottle the only thing I wanna say
is and it does get very hairy it bug
hairs do tend to cling to it so it's got
this lovely rubbery outer shell but when
it's clean it's absolutely gorgeous this
is at snazzy uvk our brand and this is a
QVC exclusive basically I find that by
challenging myself to empty this bottle
by drinking it at least three times a
day it keeps me more motivated to keep
hydrated by challenging myself and we
all know the benefits of keep hydrated
is much better for our skin for our mind
for our body for our diet there are so
many benefits
to keeping hydrated even as I'm saying
these words I know I have not drunk
enough today but it's so important to
drink enough water during the summer
months so I thought I would throw this
one in there but hydration is not only
important for what we consume but also
what we apply on our skin and one of my
favorite skincare brands Neutrogena has
recently brought out their hydro boost
range and one of my favorite products
from the range is their micellar water
and i and i've been swapping in my
regular micellar water for this one just
to give my skin a little bit of extra
hydration during these warmer months so
this one removes makeup at least my skin
feeling gorgeously soft but also really
boosts the hydration levels in my skin
and helps to lock in that moisture so
I've been using this as my first cleanse
every morning just apply this onto a
cotton pad and also is my first cleanse
in the evening too and I have noticed
that despite my lack of actual water
intake my skin is remaining beautifully
hydrated also than the range as a cream
moisturizer a gel moisturizer and again
both of which I really love but for me
this is the standout product there's
also face wipes and I think also a serum
too but yeah this and gel moisturizer
have been my real key products from the
range and very important to keep the
skin hydrates it sometimes however I do
just let the day go by and I know I
haven't drunk enough water and it is so
shocking how immediate that impact is on
my skin the next day I'll be a little
bit gray my eyes will start to look
tired at like 4 o'clock in the afternoon
it's really not good
so my SOS product for that when my skin
is really dehydrated is the event
hydrants optimal at hydrating serum now
this product feels so lovely on the skin
it's really good for sensitive skin it's
a very gentle product it's like a serum
eat milk just feels absolutely wonderful
to apply and you can feel your skin
thanking you as you apply a product like
this so if your skin
does get really dry or if you know that
your skin is dehydrated then I would
recommend especially in the summer
months adding something a little bit
more hydrating into your beauty routine
so those are my summer beauty tips
really easy tips to fit into your daily
routine as I said I use these tips
almost every single day in the summer
months and also throughout the rest of
the year as well so I hope you guys
