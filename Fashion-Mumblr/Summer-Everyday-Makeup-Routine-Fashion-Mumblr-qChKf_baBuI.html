channel today's video is going to be my
summer everyday makeup routine so this
look right here is what I'm creating in
today's video and this makeup look or
slight variations of this look is
basically what I've been wearing for the
past two months throughout the summer
months and it's what I will probably
continue to wear for the rest of summer
it's created using a mixture of
drugstore and high-end makeup so
hopefully there are some products in
there for everybody and a few new
launches as well so a little sneak peek
as to what is to come and yeah I'm not
gonna ramble too much because this could
be a terribly long video so if you'd
like to see how I made this makeup look
then carry on watching the first product
I'm going to apply is the new vow lashes
lash + brow conditioning serum so I'm
going to apply this to both my eye
lashes and my eye brows because over
summer I've been using individual lash
extensions and while they don't damage
the lashes I always think it's good to
nourish them afterwards equally on the
brows this product is great because you
can use it for both it just helps to
encourage brow hair growth which I
definitely need so it's really handy
that this is a two in one product so
I've just brushed that through my brows
and my lashes as the first step in my
makeup routine next I'm using my Lipari
ice crystal serum and this is an active
serum which basically helps the skin to
defend itself from the the problems that
can cause aging so it works against
fatigue dullness fine lines and I'm 24
going on 25 so anything that I can do to
help my skin protect itself from aging
is it's good for me so I just use one
pump of that rub it in my hands and then
press that all over my face and if I
have any left on my hands bring it down
to my neck - next is my moisturizer and
I'm using the doctor server supreme day
cream and this is a real breakthrough
product so I'm really glad I discovered
this because it works to protect the
skin from h-e-b I think it's called yes
high energy visible light which is
basically the light that you see coming
from things like your computer screen
your laptop screen and your mobile
phones so light that we do see which dr.
sever from
his research thinks as equally as
damaging to the skin as UVA and UVB the
cream also contains antioxidants so of
course it protects the skin from just
daily environmental aggressors and
living in London this is definitely
something which I need to consider in my
skincare as well as that of course it
does the job being a good moisturizer
sinks in really quickly so I don't have
to hang around too long before I apply
my makeup and it also keeps my skin
beautifully hydrated throughout the day
so recently I've really been thinking
about investing in skin care that has
additional benefits and both the serum
and the moisture is a moisturizer that
I'm using at the moment both seem to do
that as really really well and because
dr. Sarah doesn't want to compromise the
protection from the HEV light it does
not contain any SPF so of course the
next step in my daily routine is to
apply an SPF product in the summer I
like to ensure I have a fairly high
factor on my face my face doesn't tend
to tan anyway so my facial tanning
routine is a whole other story but I'm
using the origins dr. Andrew Weil mega
defense SPF 45 and this is a really
lovely light product it's also
anti-aging of course because it protects
from damaging UV rays so I'm just
putting a small amount of that on my
hands and then putting that all over my
face
as the final stat in my skincare routine
so considering I've got oily skin you
can tell that these products really
don't add any additional oil or grease
to my skin and I'm not looking too shiny
considering I've just applied three
moisturizing products to my face so
there's another reason why I really love
this combination at the moment it's
really my go-to staple summer skincare
routine so I don't need to wait too long
for this to sink in while it does I'll
just going to make myself a cup of tea
before starting with my makeup now this
is a bit of a tease I'm sorry because
this foundation is not actually out
until the 31st of August but isn't worth
the wait I promise and it's the Rimmel
fresher skin foundation this is an SPF
15 and it's a very lightweight
foundation and I just absolutely adore
the finish of this for summer it's a
really smooth texture a little bit
moosie and I just take a small amount on
my finger dot it on to the areas of my
face cheeks
and forehead and then I'm going to use
my Clinique blending brush just to swirl
this in all over the face so what makes
this foundation really fab for summer is
that it contains mineral powders within
the formula which absorb excess oil
throughout the day meaning that you
don't have that dreaded 3 p.m.
shine which for me with my oily
combination skin is really really
important as you can see is blending in
really easily just changed camera angle
slightly because I feel like you
couldn't really see the effect that the
foundation was having on my skin so
hopefully now you can see it's giving me
beautiful coverage and I've still got
that lovely blue even though the
foundation does contain oil it isn't
completely mattify the skin next thing I
always do in the mornings is apply a
little bit of lip balm mostly for my own
comfort but also to prepare my lips for
what I'm going to apply later and I'm
not too fussy when it comes to lip balms
at the moment I really like these ones
they're just really smooth fun and
handbag size lip balms but powder I'm
using the YSL souffle a class now this
one I really like because it still
leaves my skin with a bit of a glow and
if your powder phobic like I am but you
know that you need a little bit of
mortification and this is a really good
one so I start by tapping some of the
powder into the lid and I'm taking my
silver rose gold and fan brush just to
lightly pick up some of the powder
doesn't pick up too much product which
is great if you don't want to be
completely matte like myself by this
point I'm usually fairly bored of doing
my complexion so I go to move on to
brows and I'm using the benefit
precisely my brow pencil just to comb
them through and fill in all of those
gaps I fill in the brows just enough
that they have got a decent shape and I
filled in all the gaps but to be honest
I don't use too much brow product
because for an everyday summer makeup
look I don't want to look too made-up
and I find by using a pencil such as a
benefit one it gives a really natural
brow effect as opposed to using
something a bit heavy like a gel which
looks as though you have done your brows
so I find the pencil to be the perfect
balance between Donna but not looking
too done and then because my brow hair
is quite long I may not have many brow
hairs but the one
I do have a fairly long I then use the I
then use the benefit gimme brow just to
add a little bit more volume this acts
as kind of a volumizer because it really
helps to thicken the individual hairs
but also to set my brows in place so
they don't go moving around throughout
the day once that's done I'm going to
move on to the final step for my face
and that's bronzer and I'm going to be
using a two-faced prong so they have so
many bronzers available today I'm using
Sun bunny which is their most natural
bronzer it's got these two different
shades which you can swirl around to
create your perfect shade and I'm using
this absolu ginormous Marc Jacobs
bronzer brush I just find this so
perfect for applying bronzer very
naturally because it picks up the
perfect amount of product and also the
way that it's shaped means that I can
create a little bit of contour as well
which is what I always do so I'm taking
the brush it's swelling it all through
the middle and then starting underneath
my cheekbones and around my brow
hairline and just to create a little bit
of shape so under the cheekbones
I don't contour in summer so this is
this is the way of creating a little bit
of shape to my face and then moving it
around to the area's that the Sun would
naturally hit what I love about this Too
Faced one is that it does have some
shimmer in there but only in a very
natural way so I'm not sure if you can
pick it up on the camera that's given me
a beautiful Sheen but without looking
like I've applied highlighter which is
the perfect balance for my everyday
summer makeup look another tease I'm so
sorry this palette isn't out until the
28th of September but it's the Rimmel
magnifies palette in the shade 0:01 keep
calm and wear gold so these palettes
contain eight shades there's I think
there's four different palettes to
choose from this one is by far my
favorite these are just also wearable
there's a mixture of shimmers and mattes
and different color intensities I'm
going to take my zoeva rose golden luxe
crease brush which is basically a big
fluffy one and I'm going to take this
really lovely light kind of milky coffee
type shade and I'm going to apply that
all over my lid to start with this is a
really good shade if you just want to
combats any discoloration on the eyelids
or basically create a base for your
eyeshadow alternatively if you love a
really natural eye look you could just
wear this shade on its own and I tend to
use as a base and then build up from
there and then using the same brush I'm
going to go in with the darker matte
shade if I'm going out too if I want to
get dressed up I would go in with the
shimmers but for today I'm not doing
anything special and this is just a very
casual everyday lip so I'm going to
stick with the matte and this is the
darkest of the matte shades in the
palette so I'm being quite careful here
so it's very pigmented picking up a tiny
bit on the brush tapping off the excess
and I'm just going to go in with the
crease area I'm then taking these zoeva
rose gold and two three four lux
smokey shader brush and this one if you
can see on that angle is very thin so
it's great for picking up a slightly
darker shade if you don't want to use
eyeliner but still maybe you want to add
a bit more definition so I'm going to
take that same shade that I used on the
eyelid and then bring it down in place
of eyeliner just underneath my lower
lashes and this helps to build a little
bit of definition without going for
full-on eyeliner so I really just push
that in to the lashline
I don't really drag it too much just
because the skin is so delicate just
pushing it into the lash line on the
lower lashes and then the edge of the
upper lashes too so as you can see the
effect that this gives just is a little
bit more definition in the eyes but
without the full-on harsh effect of an
eyeliner which I tend to skip in the
summer months just because I think it
looks a little bit too heavy and I
prefer to be light and fresh and glowy
so that's my little trick for creating a
bit more definition next is mascara and
it's another one from Rimmel because
I've skipped out on the eyeliner I want
to have really big bold lashes and I'm
using the new-and-improved scandalize
mascara they have completely changed the
brush shape now so it's much easier to
get those lashes than the edge because
you can see it is more of a word pointy
at the essence type brush technical term
and I find that it really does help if I
curl the lashes first to create really
big dramatic lashes so I'm curling with
my usual rose gold tweezerman lashes
just giving my lashes quick squeeze and
then putting my lashes in scandalize
just wiggling the brush from root to tip
and you can see instant real deep black
color and volume within just a couple of
strokes so with just a couple of layers
of Rimmel scandaleyes reloaded I forgot
ten of their elusive bit earlier I've
got really beautiful big bold lashes and
very defined eyes without eyeliner so
this has been at my Saviour for the past
couple of weeks and what I found is it's
also very long-lasting so despite being
really really warm like I am now and and
it's even sweat proof for 24 hour words
so you can basically rely on this
mascara which is wonderful
and finally lips so because I've gone
quite bold in the eyes I'm going to keep
my lips quite neutral as I do most
summer days and for this I'm going to
use the everything stick from Topshop I
just I'm in love with this shade at the
moment I go through phases with lip
colors but I always seem to have a
slightly Coralie new deep brownie shade
as my go-to lip color this one is called
Sun doesn't actually seem to have a name
but it looks like this
and you can use this on the cheeks and
on the lips I'm not actually putting
anything on my cheeks today I don't wear
blusher everyday in summer and I feel
that wear my bronzer has created that
lovely shape I don't really want to go
in with anything like a blush in case it
dislodges it I don't read trusts my
blush skills so with the everything
stick I'm going to apply it directly
onto my lips and because I've already
got balm on my lips it really just sinks
in beautifully I absolutely adore the
color of this I would describe it as
something in between a corally pink with
almost a bit of terracotta in there so a
very wearable summer lip color if I
haven't applied the lip balm beforehand
I may want a little bit more moisture
and for that I would use a L'Oreal sexy
bomb but because I have plenty of
moisture my lips at the moment I don't
really need to so that's everything that
I do makeup wise but there's one step
that I will never skip in the summer and
that is a setting spray at the moment
I'm you
the Estee Lauder's set and refresh so
because it is so hot I want something
that not only is going to set my makeup
in place and keep it looking fresh
throughout the day but also something it
to refresh me this one does both it sets
and refreshes and it has this very fine
mist which is great because I know a lot
of them can make your face a bit wet so
I just hold this about 30 centimeters
away from my face and mist to set my
makeup take the hair out the pony and we
are done so this is the finished makeup
look you probably recognize it from me
wearing it most days in summer sometimes
I tend to switch to products around but
the routine and the general look pretty
much stays the same I really hope you
