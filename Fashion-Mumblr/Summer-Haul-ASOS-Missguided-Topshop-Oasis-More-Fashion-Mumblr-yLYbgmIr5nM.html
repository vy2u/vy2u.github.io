misguided Topshop rule island oasis
misguided Topshop Oasis estas pesos
misguided Topshop warehouse oasis hey
guys welcome to my collective summer
haul firstly sorry about my CV a kind of
hair today I was not intending on
filming this video but my given memory
card decided to delete half the files
for the video that should have been
going up today so wasn't planning on
filming this video I have been shopping
quite a lot recently and I thought I
would show you guys what I picked up
firstly I went to Topshop on Oxford
Circus which is always really dangerous
place for you to go they always have the
newest trends in that store and I just
can't say no when I see the
autumn/winter trends coming in they're
all really really beautiful so picked up
quite a few items from Bath the first
thing you might have already spotted on
my Instagram so I actually wore them to
a really lovely afternoon tea last
weekend but it's these gorgeous long
almost flare very wide leg trousers I
will show a clip of me wearing them
because you definitely can't see more in
a viewfinder but they've got this really
lovely kind of graphic 70s print on
language I really love I didn't think it
would suit me but with a pair of nice
chunky heels which are hidden by the
ginormously wide fled and
really cute they're super high waisted
and even though I got my usual size I
still actually had to put a little
safety pin in the back just because when
I wear high rates of things I really
like them to fit me how to you perfectly
on the hips and I have quite wide hips
and narrow waist so I always find that
need to pin things I will probably chop
these up and sew them so they fit me
perfectly but so now safety pin do the
trick so I've been loving these along
them a couple of times now and I always
get someone commenting on them so really
really like these we're still already
posted these two next items on my blog
already just because I could not wait to
wear them because they are so so
gorgeous first thing is this white
scalloped edge skirt you might have seen
I also have the gray and white version
which I think I have yeah yes oh I also
have the gray in my version which I wear
a lot so I thought I'd get the white
version as well I'm really enjoying it
wearing it while I've still got
reasonably tanned legs from some other
days but I think this is just gonna be a
summer classic it's kind of a denim
material it's quite short so you kind of
have to think about what occasions it's
appropriate for wearing too but it's
really really cute so have a look at the
outfit of the day blog post which I'll
link below and in that blog posting also
from Topshop these order to shoot lease
which I picked up recently they are
everything I love in a shoe brown suede
pom-poms pointy toe the only thing that
it's not what I usually go for is the
fact that their flats normally
heels but these are just two gorgeous
meats they know to absolutely love them
and they go really nicely with the white
skirt so been pairing those together
quite a lot recently and the last thing
from Topshop and this was actually
inspired by two girls that I'm slightly
obsessed with on Instagram it's EJ style
and Hanna Koski from the search my
finger from a fashion fix and they both
have been starting up some really
gorgeous outfits recently which look
like Chloe outfits and they basically
inspired me to pick up this blouse and
not sure a few of them actually houses
flowers but they kind of rock this sort
of style and I really want to get that
look of guys so picks up this kind of
vest top cross over blouse from Topshop
it's got the really gorgeous stripes
which white in the chloe autumn winter
fashion show and it's got paws over on
the front I really like crossover detail
I think I may have to wear that will
come some underneath just it's quite low
cut but gorgeous colors and will
definitely be wearing this Frankie
awesome as well the next shop that I
went into was OSS and I have been really
obsessed with Oasis recently this top
that I'm wearing is from the Leonie
collection and you might have seen this
on pre busy in my first outfit Diaries
video from Seville so I wore this in
that video I was in the Oxford Street
stories and they absolutely loved that
store it's really really beautiful it's
got the gorgeous kind of tile floor up
on the level above so make sure you go
upstairs if you remember in that stores
it's just passi gorgeous but I really
liked the look of this kind of folk
style dress when I went in there I never
I'm really sure if I can get away with
the kind of folk style that's going on
at the moment
but really wanted to give it a go and
this is quite a short length so I
thought it would be quite a cute and
sexy way to where the trend it's got a
waist belt as well it's got a brown
wasn't for lack it's got kind of a black
leather wasteful I may switch this my
rose gold chain belt because I just
think that looks really cute everything
and it has buttoned down in the middle
so I think this will just be a really
cute girly way of wearing the folk trend
might even pair it with my Top Shop
suede sandals who knows also in a way
says I grabbed this navy and white
stripe jump so I think it looks like it
will be a really lovely shape it's got
lots of darts and kind of the shapes are
even thought out on the chest and bodice
area and then it's got really cute
detailing I think it's got pockets yeah
it's got some pockets on the hips as
well zip down the back and then this tie
feature around the waist so it should be
a really lovely shake gonna try it on
and see how long it is for me I might
need to take the bottom out Novak's only
tiny I just thought this is a really
gorgeous pattern and I've been really
into I'm John sees recently I've been
surprising myself how often I've been
wanting to wear them it's kind of a sort
of thing they don't have to think about
because don't you pair it with anything
just choose a nice pair of shoes and
you're ready to go really like this with
this lipstick as well actually this
lipstick is the Estee Lauder pure color
Envy in the shade defiant
no it's actually the shade volatile
absolutely love this I think this is in
my July favorites one more thing I
picked up in a recess is this pair of
shoes they're kind of a very low heel
which is quite unusual for me know me I
prefer the high heel
these are on sale down from 45 pounds to
30 and I thought I could wear these with
white jeans maybe on the days and I
thought oh well commence do they look
really comfortable and I'm trago quite a
few selfies
next is a sauce I had a lovely big
delivery from the postman yesterday
morning he chopped off all the ASIS
things I've been ordering recently don't
bring it into this whole white and kind
of blue Mediterranean embroidery kind of
style even though I don't have any more
summer holidays planned but I picked up
this dress it's actually a new leprous
but I got this on ASOS it is definitely
more holiday P so I'm gonna try and wear
this in the UK because I just think it's
a really lovely pattern it has got a tie
a corset style fastening on the back
which is really nice if you want to give
yourself a really flattering shape and
then down at the bottom it's got almost
like a gypsy style skirt which is really
cute they're gonna save this one for
next summer some of my it's a perfect
thing to just stick on over a bikini
because it's nice and long it's good
coverage for right lunchtime they're
perfect for just throwing on a bikini
then I saw this button-down denim
miniskirt so it's not too long it's the
same kind of shape as the suede skirt
which I picked up from a source in my
last haul which I linked below but I've
been wearing the suede one so much and I
thought denim was just as wearable and I
probably wear this on maybe
I think this one will transition really
well into autumn trends as well maybe
wear of the thick chunky jumper but this
is actually from fashion reunion so I've
got it from a husband it's fashion Union
brand got the cute pockets on the front
and yeah it's a really nice bright denim
there's quite a few videos on the market
but I picked this once it's a lovely
bright denim and I just think it'll be a
really lovely fair time to go with on
Stanford's this next item is also on
that whole kind of Chloe autumn might
survive and it's a river line and
flowers but picked it up from a sauce so
this is quite an oversized blouse I got
a size 6 but as you can see it is really
really huge and oversized it's got 3/4
sleeves that like a roll at the hem so a
perfect fall if you're working and you
just want to get your sleeves out the
way these are then you're not going to
get in the way it's got really pretty
gold buttons going all the way down I'll
probably leave the first couple of
buttons I'm done just to give it a
really relaxed fits looking at it in the
viewfinder I'm not really sure if these
colors suit me but I will try it on and
let me know what you guys think if I can
get away with wearing this sorry I'm
whizzing through them so quickly it's
just I have so much stuff that I wanted
to show you and don't want to make this
a four hour long video I can't actually
remember if this was from a sauce or if
I picked it up from the warehouse store
is something
from this last excess of whatever I
don't remember ordering anything from
warehouse but a may it is also a folk
style address in a slightly lighter
print so this is always a little bit
more kind of spring/summer it's got
really lovely tassel detail on the neck
fastening doesn't have a waist belt so I
think will be a much looser fit but it's
really lovely soft material so I think
I'm pretty aware of this as a day dress
and yeah this one is from warehouse
again with the lovely kind of
three-quarter length sleeves and then
the last clothing item that I picked up
from any source is by far my favorites
and as you might have guessed I'm
obsessive Slade and I'm obsessed with
scalloped edges and this last thing
really mixes the two and absolutely love
it
it is this beautiful scalloped edge of
suede very kind of rusty ready colored
skirt I absolutely love this and her
worn it yeah but I'm sure I'm going to
wear it all the time so apologies in
advance if there's gonna be hooking up
my Instagram feed in my last ASOS video
you guys absolutely loved the more sandy
colored suede skirt which I picked up
and I think I will be getting just as
much use out of this one if not more
because it's got the Eastcote edges
yeah love this piece this is definitely
my favorite thing I've seen on accessory
something I also picked up this pair of
sunglasses from a brand called in the
specs I'm not gonna lie I got these
because I read in for ups here that the
specs yes the upcoming sunglasses brand
and I thought these are really cute kind
of 60s style sunglasses I don't have any
light blue mirrored sunglasses so that's
my excuse for buying these and then
another new look fashion piece which I
also bought from a sauce is this pair of
sandals I think these older perhaps you
call just with the skirts and I picked
up a white solid one and the swags
clip-on so these were losing the price
but I remember thinking what good value
they were I will link them below so you
can go and check it out themselves but
these have got a really lovely wooden
block here which I always find really
really comfortable then if you want a
bit of extra height but don't want to be
hobbling around all day I find chunky
heels are the best or that kind of thing
and then they've got a tie fastening
around the ankle so you
love these as kind of my everyday type
of heels as I said I'm a midget I need
to wear heels and I think I'll be
getting a lot of wear out of things over
the next few months you know me I cannot
run a sauce about picking up a few
beauty pieces as well and it picks up
some pieces from nars firstly they're
narcissists pallets I held up so long
from getting this I never really got the
height when it first came out but I saw
one on the website I was feeling spendy
so I decided to pick it up he has this
really awesome mirrored box packaging
which i think is great for traveling on
the go maybe you don't need to carry
extra mirror with you but then it also
has this ginormous mirror in the lid as
well you've got 8 eyeshadow shades in
here ranging from Pink's to bronzes and
then some slightly warmer shades as well
I'm not sure if I'll use the blue one or
this kind of gray slate one but I'll try
and create a look at using the narcissus
palette and do a video on that so let me
know if that's something that you like
at the moment I'm not 100% sure if it
was worth the money because it was quite
pricey but I knew the nonce I shall use
a really good quality and that also
shades and he and I love so but I really
play around with this create some
different looks and I'm sure that don't
I won't fall for the hype sooner or
later I also got these soft to touch my
shadow crayon and there's no way I'm
gonna be able to say this many minutes
Iraq line here at lien IRA k lines in
Rockland I can over basically it's a
very soft kind of pink a very soft pink
champagne shade and I have been really
loving using eye shadow pencils recently
find them so easy to use and they just
blend really easily all over the lid so
I picked this up mostly for using on the
kind of brow bone but I think will be
really lovely on more of a soft maybe
springtime just in light pink shimmery
eyelid kind of color so I'm looking
forward to giving this a go and lastly
the NARS creamy concealer which I ran
out of I've always been a fan of this
I'm the shade custard which is
notoriously hard to find I can never
seem to get it in Space NK but I saw the
Asus was in stock so I grabbed and you
NARS creamy concealer in custard and
then last but not least I also did a
misguided all I feel like I was really
late onto the whole misguided bandwagon
but I am now realizing that they have
some really really cute things on the
website the first thing that I picked up
is this really gorgeous pair of monster
o jeans with all the rips then I don't
know if I'm cool enough to really get
away with these trousers so you guys I
have to let me know I've never really
straight to you far from the whole
skinny jean looks
yeah we'll see if I can pull this off
these really cute elephant shorts were
in the sale I think there was something
ridiculous like twelve pounds and
although I don't have any more summer
holidays I think I'll just store these
up in my suitcase and a lot ready for
next summer and I just didn't even look
adorable whether I wear them with a
bikini or going with a white t-shirt we
really love elephants I love this little
free pattern around the edges so yeah I
think they go to these for 12 pounds
then we have another of these whole
white and blue very tops I told you I'm
completely obsessed with this Holden
Friedrich style the only thing that
annoys me when I shop online is that
everything comes so crisp so I don't
need to give this a good old iron or
steam or something before I first wear
it but it's this gorgeous soft kind of
crappy material so it's really lovely
and light if you are on holiday you're
not going to get too hot and sweaty uses
a very breathable material and the
length is quite short so I think it'll
be quite a cropped top but without
showing of tummy buttons so should be a
really lovely legs I look forwards
giving us a try and then the final piece
is this really really gorgeous I say if
this is maybe like an elephant gray
suede how would you describe this color
taupe
but yeah it is a faux suede gray brown
whatever you want to call it tank top I
just absolutely love anything suede faux
suede and I thought this would look
absolutely gorgeous with white jeans I
think this color is really versatile I
think I'll be wearing this kind of color
and definitely the star breaks for our
autumn and winter probably need to find
some nice warmer things to wear with
this but for now I'll just love love
love color and excited to wear this so
there we have it that's all the things
that I have picked up recently over the
last couple of weeks I feel like I'm
really starting to transition into
autumn winter pieces even though summer
is not over or hopefully it's not over
