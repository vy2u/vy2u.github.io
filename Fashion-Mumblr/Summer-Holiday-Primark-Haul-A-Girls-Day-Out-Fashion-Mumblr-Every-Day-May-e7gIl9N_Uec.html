part 2 part 3 goddamn losing track
already that's not a good sign so today
it's Bank Holiday Monday and I'm going
out for brunch with three of my best
girlfriends Sophie Hannah and Vicki and
we're gonna go to the Hawks tuna Hoban
I've only ever been there for work
commuting so it's gonna be nice to go
there on a more chilled note I thought
I'd quickly do an outfit of the day
before I head out and also I decided
that because yesterday I said I was
gonna link on my outfit things that
could take quite a long time so instead
what I've done is I've made a page on my
blog called shop and where I've
basically just linked most of the stuff
in my wardrobe so I will leave that blog
post down below and most of stuff and
I'm wearing it should be in that blog
post so today I'm wearing this bow top
from Oasis this is an exception it's not
gonna be in the shop because it's quite
old I got this last season those of you
guys asked for it was from in my spring
wardrobe essentials and I was like sorry
it's really old I did try to find a new
one and I email even emailed them to see
if they've got a new version but they
haven't and then I'm wearing my River
Island trousers I've always quite a lot
at Fashion Week and these are links on
the shop page then also where is it I'm
taking my Valentino handbag kind of goes
with what I'm wearing today including my
new lipstick which is Tom Ford forbidden
pink which I'm a big fan of so this is
how the outfit of the day looks all
together bag and these shoes are from I
think they're from Dorothy Perkins or
Miss Selfridge but they're quite old as
well so I've got a little goodie bag
full of products to give my friends
later they are in for a treat got some
nice bits and bobs in there for them to
rummage through so I'm gonna head out
now and meet the girls
which one says
we have had a lovely lunch and now we
are in Primark buying Beach things so
there's got a nice captain Hannah's
gonna cut but oh she's got beacon
speakers in each home you go Vic nothing
nothing I was seeking
and they're looking at you
sure
so we decided to come to good ship so
fly both our suitcases and we've just
seen that the tide is out which means
that the ramps get on suppose oh my God
look how steep that is oh my god oh my
god oh I've got heels on as well
so we're being very naughty about having
a benefit Sunday's which consists of a
little biscuit pink whipped creams
meringue posters but very much
just got back home again and Dexter is
in such a crazy mood Charlie's not here
he's gone out for drinks with his
friends I'm not too sure how long
Dexter's been alone by himself but he is
seriously hyper he is kissing me like
crazy and just wants to shred everything
so I've just been having a little play
with my little boy my brows are looking
so much better
I had them waxed and tinted on a good
ship benefit and I completely forgot but
if you get your brows done by benefits
throughout may you get a free Guinea
brow which is so good because give me
brow is like 18 pounds but it cost me
nine pounds to get my brows done so
that's really good it's because they're
doing their benefit brow March this
month so I have talked about this in a
previous vlog but it's such a good thing
to do it's basically a March and the two
charities are refuge and I think Miss
Women's Council on a common with the
name of it but all the proceeds for the
March go to that and it's such a fun day
out mom and I did it last year if I can
find the vlog I'll link it down below I
think is on my first ever vlogs and it's
like a March maybe two hours around
London and all the girls from benefit
are there you get like a little makeup
samples you get a glasses with the brows
on we got capes we've got t-shirts and
it was just so much fun so if you're
around London on May the 8th which is
this weekend I think knowingly I'm not
in Lanzarote but if you are around it's
so worth going it was so much fun
so yes that is what benefit was doing
this month we had a glass of champagne
each we had a bottle so had a few
glasses each and then we had a cup of
tea because we are grannies and we had a
benefit sunday which was amazing I'm
definitely filmed that so you guys will
have already seen it and yet I'm home
now and it's so rare that I have the
house to myself and Charlie's not here
so I'm gonna be really tragic and I'm
gonna put something crap like homes
under the hammer on the TV I'm gonna get
a video edited probably the beginning of
this one and one of the ones that I
filmed yesterday so yeah I need to get
ahead because tomorrow and Wednesday are
work work work meeting
all day so I'm gonna crack on with some
work now trying get ahead of myself but
oh my god what has he got he shredding
something what have you got you naughty
boy oh he's got a toilet roll your base
you're in such an awesome mood let go
let go you did heard well I'm glad to
see your eyes a little bit better go god
he's clinging on for dear life no more
TV
oh my god I told you who isn't a naughty
mood okay actually I probably better put
that in the bitmap knife yes I'm talking
about you you doesn't run sir
so I'm gonna go and put some super comfy
clothes on and I will show you what I
picked up in Primark I'll do a mini
Primark haul because I'm not gonna film
a whole Primark video because I think I
only got about five things so I'll give
you a little mini in vlog panicles okay
so the first thing of course that
everything is in is this massive
suitcase I got this because it looks
quite like come over the name of the
brand I think it's something like brick
or a Dexter he's in a really horny mood
no no no but yeah I thought it was quite
nice detail with these kind of shoulder
shoulder pads corner pads Dexter you
can't hump my suitcase so yeah I thought
that was quite a nice design and this
was 38 pounds yeah so quite pleased with
that
inside the suitcase we have the main at
Primark bag I'll just take that out so
you can see the suitcase in more detail
so it's got this big zipper pocket so
you can zip up that section and then
it's got the straps over this side I
thought this is a really good sized
suitcase for upcoming trips like
Lanzarote which are four or five days
and you don't really need one your big
suitcases but hand luggage is just not
quite enough so in this bag let's see so
I picked up super boring I picked up a
couple of rolls that's my receipt a
couple of rolls of there cotton pads
because they're 50 P and I think in
Boots
it's a pound for these so I've got
those and I also like I'm not sure if
you can see but they have like stitching
so they don't they don't like unravel
when you're using them so they're really
good stop it when he's uh when he's
horny he likes to chew things he's
shredded my dressing-gown to smithereens
so I'd rather you didn't shred her oh
look he's made a hole in it stop it
little beasty
oi stop it and then I picked up a shirt
this is actually too big for me I think
I got a size 10 let's see yeah size 10
it was 10 pounds and I thought over the
top of a bikini this would look really
cute so just really loose with the
sleeves rolled up maybe even tie it into
a bit of a tie waist and yeah I thought
that would look really nice just undone
really loose over the top of a bikini
next inside the bag I picked up this
blanket with this throw it Dexter stop
it so this is really lovely kind of
pastel colors trying to show you in a
better light yes we've got this
beautiful pastel color oh it's so soft
literally the softest thing ever I
really got this for Trek America more
than anything because I don't know we're
camping so I thought it'd be nice to
have something nice and cozy nice and
warm and something nice and soft and
snuggly else
I also also picked up this dressing-gown
I thought it looked a little bit
Victoria's Secret ish with the pink and
white stripes and then it's also got
this lovely lace detail and some
pom-poms down there as well this was 8
pounds I want to say let's have a look
10 pounds for this and this I think was
5 pounds
don't quote me on that though not too
sure and yeah and again for holidays I
like to wear dressing gowns and I'm on
holiday and to honest there was nothing
wrong with my white lacy one but I
thought this one was cute and my friend
Sophie also got the matching ones so we
can be cute and matching when we wear
them together
a couple more things I picked up this
handbag because I thought it was quite I
mean it's not really a dupe for the
Chloe Fay bag not Fay was according to
Chloe Hudson but it is fairly similar
along the same lines and I think this
would be a nice bag for summer traveling
on a holiday it's big enough for my
Olympus camera and my purse and a few
other bits and bobs as well this I think
was 12 pounds let's say 9 pounds yeah so
really really chuffed with that and last
but not least I got this candle mostly
because it is rose gold this was 5
pounds and it smells really nice it's
called golden do you scented candle and
yeah Charlie and I like to have lots of
candles down the lounge so I thought I'd
pick up a new one so you know how I said
I had loads of work to do well I've
ended up just procrastinating instead so
I'm having a major makeup clear-out
which I have to say is long overdue got
a little collection of foundations and
moisturizers over there that I'm going
to chuck out I've got an hourglass this
is probably the most expensive
foundation I ever bought it's the
hourglass liquid powder foundation and
then got this from Sephora back in
September last year actually it's not a
year old I thought it was gonna be over
a year old but it was never quite right
for my skin so 58 pounds not very well
spent that's going in the bin because I
never use it
actually have I got any friends that
might like this I might puts in a bag my
friends actually about the origins
ginseng eye cream because I have not
used that in so long either
it's definitely over a year old bare
minerals complexion rescue this is from
last summer but there is so little left
in here and I have got another full ones
there's no point in keeping that same
with this one
Rimmel True Match i only tend to wear
this foundation in winter and i do love
it in winter but it's the drugstore once
i can buy a new one when it comes to
winter season and there's not that much
left in here either
then i've got a few little splurges left
in my Liz Earle moisturiser again I love
this stuff there's no point in keeping
one that's in
nearly empty when I haven't used it in
ages Nivea express hydration primer I
just never really got along with that
that well Naz pure radiant tinted
moisturizer again hardly anything left
in that and it's super old and then I'm
going to put this in the box my friends
because Rimmel True Match and it's just
so-now just never really worked for me I
don't know if I just didn't really like
the coverage but just not a big fan of
this so that again is going in my friend
bag so it's a few hours later now it's
about 20 to 10 I'm just sitting in
lounge got made in chelsea on in the
background
I'm also watching vlogs mega double
screening I'm becoming so obsessed with
watching like really cinema
cinematography cinematics and message oh
my god I'm becoming really obsessed with
watching the cinematic travel vlogs like
there's so many people that have got
this DJI Osmo I think it's called and
the DJI phantom 3 or 4 drone and their
travel videos are amazing like giving me
some serious inspiration for videos I
want to create this year I'm seriously
considering getting a drone for track
America because I just think the kind of
footage I could get with that would be
so amazing but they're expensive so not
a decision I'm going to just make like
that so if anyone's got a drone or has a
new drone at knowledge then please do
share with me I'm gonna have family
country call now my favorite food in the
whole world I literally love them so
much I have about four a day
and Charlie's not back home yet he
hasn't replied to my text for like two
hours very naughty but I'm gonna take a
deck stuffed bed with me because when
Charlie's not here he liked to kiss
Dexter in bed and choice very seedy and
doesn't that next from the bed so I'm
going to be naughty and take this little
sausage into bed with me because he's to
be a little bit poorly and when we're
there I'm going to edit this vlog so I
thought I would say good night switch
off and I'll see you in the morning for
a really busy day of meetings actually
two busy days of meetings so yeah that's
a plan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
