you my Sunday evening pant routine
Sunday's are all about relaxing and
today I've just been doing a little bit
of yoga at home
hence the gym where I start by taking
off my jewelry
it's lovely ringing from Monica Pineda
and my favorite Swarovski necklace I
keep them safe in this little tray by
the side of my bed then I change them
something a little bit more comfortable
my super fluffy dressing-gown then I run
the taps to make a really lovely hot
bath and take off all the day's makeup
using something like the Nivea three and
one my slow cleansing water
this stuff's lovely and gentle but it
really does remove all the day's makeup
then I use the Liz Earle eyebright
student I loan
just to get rid of any remaining mascara
lovely and gentle and I like to just
hold it on to the IRA to really soothe
before wiping away the mascara then I
like to double cleanse using something
like the Oskar innocence cleansing balm
the very thick luxurious gel perfect for
deep cleansing and I tend to save this
for Pam the evenings next I choose a
face mask I've got lots of masks so it's
fun not to limit it to just one I like
to multi mask and pop a different mask
on different areas of the face today I'm
using clear improvements active charcoal
mask my t-zone and the origins original
skin for my cheeks I like to give Dexter
a peak business before I pop the mask on
of course look at their cute little face
I apply the origins charcoal mask with a
brush but it's just as easy to do with
your fingers I love how this mask as it
dries you can really feel the charcoal
pulling the dirt out of your skin and
then I use my fingers to apply the
original skin to my cheeks it's great
for renewing the skin and especially if
you have any redness like I do it helps
to calm and deflating skin
while both masks are drying I like to
light all the candles in my bathroom my
favorite is this one from florists and
I've also got a few local produce ones
one from wood wick and a few others
which I got from blogging events
I pour some near liquid yoga bar soaked
into the bath it has a gorgeous
fragrance and it's lovely at relaxing
any aching muscles then I treat myself
to the German own Christmas bath salts
have a little read while the mask dries
and then remove using more water my
fingers and circular motions which just
helps to exfoliate the skin even more
I'm using the pure algae perfect for
platinum shampoo and conditioner
followed by the Philip Kinsey
elasticized I only users once or twice a
month that's great for detangling and
really helping with a manageability and
condition of my hair I spread it all
through the lengths and then comb it
through I leave it in while tie my hair
up in a bun just to get it out of the
way
and then using the L'Occitane
rebalancing shower gel on one of these
net puffy things all over the body as
well as the face I like to double
cleanse the body I'm using the botanic
unfledged sugar scrub this stuff is
really lovely and granulated so it's
perfect for dry areas like the elbows or
knees
and then I shower everything away I
apply the origins original skin serum
all over the face followed by the eye
doctor just in the eye contour area and
then I go in with the dolphin eight
flower nectar it's a very luxurious oil
which I apply all over the face it
smells heavenly as well and then the
Clarins body treatment oil I just apply
all over the body being my lens is super
soft I give the extra few more kisses as
been a whole hour since I last system
and then a PRG perfect for platinum
conditioning spray which helps me to be
able to brush through my hair before
blow-drying I tie it all up in a bun
and then apply some Elizabeth Arden 8
hour lip balm to my lips and the Dolphin
ideal resource overnight cream to my
face my all-time favorite night cream
and it just really helps to seal in all
the other products that I put on my face
my mouth's Irish Tanja leaked rose hand
cream onto my hands and then check my
diary for any appointments of the week
ahead I like to write myself a little
to-do list just to get everything off my
mind
and then miss the room is something like
the neon lavender jasmine and Brazilian
rosewood water spray I turn on my ex OH
lights which are from a brand pulled up
and lights
in case you're wondering
and then turn the lights out and into
that a bit my little boy
Dexter likes to help me with my emails
and my tweets before it's lights-out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
