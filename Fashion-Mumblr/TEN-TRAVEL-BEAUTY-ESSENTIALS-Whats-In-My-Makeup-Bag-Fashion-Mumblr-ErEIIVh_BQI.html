me for today's video it's going to be a
very chilled out chassis casual one
today I am here in beautiful Antigua
just come into my room after a day on
the beach and I thought I would catch up
with you guys about some of my beauty
essentials for when I travel it's
getting to that time of year where some
of us are planning our summer vacations
so I thought it might be useful to share
with you a few of my essentials I've
whittled it down to 10 categories let's
say I've got a few products in each
category so I'm just going to get
straight stuck in there and I feel like
the obvious one to start with is SPF and
I do have a few favorites that keep
going back to number one to me is p20 I
just find their cream especially well I
choose an oil there once date for me
just i never burn with it and you really
do only need to apply it once a day i've
actually got the fact that 15 with me
because i also loved his win his wins on
my favorite browns i love the smell i
love the packaging and i love the
product this is SPF 30 it's that instant
glow so it gives your skin a bit of a
sparkle when you first put it on so it's
great for those first few days on
holiday when you just want your skin to
look a little bit better then suppose
done normally top up with something like
the p20 as I said the fact 15 but I do
find that I get a better tan with p20
than I do with this one I also love the
SPF 50 spray which has come out recently
with La Roche per day this is so
important for any areas that potentially
do get a little bit more burnt I like to
make sure my face is ultra protected I
don't want any early wrinkles or signs
of sun damage on my face also on my
decollete area I like to make sure
that's totally covered so this is a
fantastic way of just topping up your
sun protection during the day it really
is as easy as misting it on for extra
protection I wouldn't advise using this
alone but more as a top-up so what I do
like to use on my face the beginning of
the day is the factor 50 this is the 8
hour cream face moisturizer with SPF 50
and this remover I just use on a daily
basis I wake up a wash my face and I put
this on to totally protect my face from
any kind of sun damage it's not an
all-day product so it is important to
top it up with something like this or
you can just apply another layer of this
after you can't see or if you get your
face wet anything like that just make
sure to keep reapplying this
also important to make sure that your
face is totally protected it is not
worth getting any burn I think it's been
a good year or so since I've got sunburn
because now I'm just so so careful even
the factor 30 is the lower style going
out because what I prefer to do is
actually fake can while I'm away so that
brings me nicely onto my next beauty
essentials now I always take fake tan
with me when I go on holiday I like to
fake tan before I go and then keep my
tans hopped up and even intensify while
I travel so I take two things with me a
body tan and a face specific tan at the
moment I'm really liking the Bondi sun's
ultra dark I feel that it's just such a
natural color it's not as expensive as
Vita liberals which I do absolutely also
adore the distance is a little bit more
affordable so great because you do use
quite a lot of it when you're away if
you just want to get super super dark so
for me this is the color that I
absolutely adore ultra dark is what I'm
wearing right now I feel like it looks
pretty natural and other people have
been congratulating me on my terms
despite the fact we've only read in a
few days and that's because I've got my
little secret weapon with me
I do also like to bring something for
the face because as I mentioned with SPF
50 I don't really get that much of time
on my face so this is from Gagne on
Whistler if they're no streets bronzer
self-tanning dry mist and with this I
just get a perfectly natural sunkissed
look on my face so what I like to do
after using a mindful of water in the
mornings I'll just spray this easily all
over my face making sure to do the size
under the neck etc and it just gives a
supernatural Pam really simple holiday
essential and I was definitely recommend
getting this so that your face commits
the same color as your body so if your
fake tanning on holiday you need to make
sure your tan looks as good as it
possibly can so you want to make sure
you are exfoliating while you're away I
have a couple of essentials I like
spring with me first of all is a body
scrub and this is from the new brand
being by sanctuary so you can get this
in Boots and this is their chili mango
and tonka bean body scrub so I don't
know about you but for me sanctuary I
think of that brand I think of our boys
gross while being is then you kind of
younger edgy assist around and I
actually went to Ibiza to discover the
brand recently absolutely fell in love
with all their products they all smell
amazing
they literally smell good enough to eat
don't eat them as tempting as it
beep so this is the mango and tonka bean
and oh my god it literally smells like a
bag of starbursts has exploded in your
body scrub it makes sorry making my
mouth water right now and what I
absolutely love about this is that it's
a scrub that's really actually very
grainy so it really gets rid of any of
those dead skin cells ensuring your
natural tan last longer and your skin is
prepared for your fake tan as well this
is one of the strongest but also
gentlest if that makes sense exfoliating
scrubs I've ever tried and for me it's
an essential for when I'm going to fake
tan but the fragrance of this as well
just makes it such a pleasure to use and
a real treat for when you're on holiday
so once again it's affordable it's from
boots highly highly recommended
but then when you've got your fake
tunnel and perhaps you don't want
something quite as harsh as this then I
would recommend packing some exfoliating
gloves these are from soap &amp;amp; Glory I
just use whatever shower gel the hotel
provides and give myself a nice gentle
scrub to ensure that my fake tan is
fading evenly and my real-time installed
in evening a so yeah I always have some
exfoliation gloves with me in my
suitcase whenever I go away moving on to
hair and the Sun the sea and saltwater
can play havoc with long hair especially
this bleached like mine so I always have
to take a mask with me when I travel at
the moment I am using the Garnier
ultimate blends three-in-one last this
is their wholesome nourish and not only
does this smell aptly incredible but
it's affordable and it really works
wonders on my hair I'd like to take a
big scoop of this when I hurt in towel
dried and then actually I've still got
something right now I've had some in all
day and yeah so I'll dry my hair is take
scoop of this and transfer it through
the ends that is pretty much the only
thing that will allow me to brush my
hair otherwise I just find I have
dreadlocks especially after a day on the
beach but by using a mask instead of
just a normal conditioner it really
helps to deeply nourish the hair which
if your hair is bleached or if you do
have trouble with tangled hair when
you're away I would HIGHLY highly
recommend this one is actually
three-in-one you can wash it out when
you're in the shower you can leave it in
dry hair to smooth away any flyaways so
while it is quite big I think it's worth
with the space and awake in your
suitcase because I honestly wouldn't
even like to think what my hair is like
if I didn't ruin something like this on
holiday with me so sticking with the
hair theme my next essential is my wet
brush I do not know what I would do
without this
especially on holiday it's pretty much a
godsend for anyone with bleached or
Northey hair like me I used to spend
literally hours of trying to brush my
hair before I got the wet brush but now
just seems like a problem from the past
I use in the shower I use it when my
hair is full of deep conditioner so
definitely an essential if you have not
had like mine and then also when I
travel for my hair I absolutely have to
bring with me my invisible balls I have
a selection of clothes with me I've got
clear pink and neon yellow the neon ones
my least favorite I like the clear ones
and also the blush pink ones which I
know you guys noticed quite a lot when I
was wearing a little gold charm I'll
leave them all link down below but
Invisibles just stop my hair stands from
snapping they stop my hair getting
tangled and then super easy to take in
and out so I remember before I really
discovered Invisibles I would just use
normal hair levels and then you know
what it's like if I'm snorkeling or if
you're on a beach and it's windy got a
little bit of sand in your hair
your hair can probably get so knotted
around those old school hair bubbles but
I just never have any problems with
Invisibles so these now always come with
me on my summer trip ok so now getting
to my last few essentials I never go
anywhere without my sonic chic
toothbrush this is just the handiest
little device ever it basically is a
normal electric toothbrush with a little
button there to turn it on and but it
comes in this incredibly handy and very
very hygienic travel case they've got
loads of cute designs I used to have a
blue floral one and I used it so much it
was practically falling apart now I've
got this cute little also floral with
word love on it but for me these just so
practical I take them on the everything
with me you can just chuck it into your
toiletry bag and because it's got a
little lid you know that it's not going
to get any hair or dirt or makeup on it
so this is comes with me everywhere
whether it's YouTube rain keep over
traveling etc similar kind of deal with
the new Venus snaps I say new they've
been around for a few years it's in a
pink case now which I know of course so
this is basically means you don't need
to worry about your razors being
floating around in your suitcase which
could potentially be very dangerous and
also you don't need to worry about the
head control monkey and you know the
heads that have got like some moisture
bars they would just be absolute
disgusting in your suitcase but you can
actually put any hair
you want on this but it's just tiny and
it comes in little travel pouch so a
very nifty gadget for taking my holiday
with you I know they're kind of
expensive but I would recommend just
getting one you can always replace the
heads on them and they're just seriously
convenient and then my last two
essentials are both body oils both very
different reasons why I bring them so
first of all I have the Avon Skin So
Soft oil and identical you guys know
about this but there's kind of a rumor
which is most definitely true because I
have tried it out myself that this is
also a very effective mosquito and
insect repellent so I like to use this
in the evenings just almost like a
finishing touch to spritz myself with
this not intending it as a body oil but
more as an insect repellent that doesn't
absolutely stink apparently they're
using the army for insect repellent as
well but it's a dry oil spray it doesn't
have any nasty smells it has quite a
pleasant smell actually it's not insect
repellent II but it does the trick
but oil that does have an amazing smell
and that I do use more of the luxury is
the Estee Lauder bronze goddess oil so I
totally ran out of this last year I used
it so much on almost the holidays so I
now have the new one this is a body oil
it does leave you quite shimmery to have
got these little gold
sparkling particles in there but what I
love most about this is of course the
fragrance for me Estee Lauder bronze
goddess is just one of those smells that
will orange remind me of holidays apps
that you love it and I've tried a lot of
these kind of designer body oils and
this one has the most strong fragrance
in there so you don't even need to bring
a perfume with you just spritz this on
your arms and your shoulders then that
is your favorite source for the evening
so big big big fan of this one so I feel
like that may have been a little bit
more than 10 but hopefully you guys
enjoyed hearing my holiday beauty
essentials I would love to know what
your essentials are as well so if you've
got any pieces that maybe I've forgotten
