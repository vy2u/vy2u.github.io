me for today's video which is going to
be testing out some new beauty launches
and my first impressions I normally
would film this as a sit down video but
I thought today I would film it more in
a vlog format I think I can just talk
about the products a lot more naturally
and apply them with you I have already
put a few of the new products on my face
and I did film it but then when I looked
back at the footage it just wasn't very
nice
so when I'm explaining them I will
insert a few clips but I didn't want
that to be like the style of the video
so today as you can just tell I just got
out the shower and decided to pop a load
of new things on my face I'll briefly go
through what I have on so far and what I
think of them so first of all I wanted
to try the new Eve LOM radiance face oil
so Eve LOM is a brand that generally
with their products I just love the
consistency of them I find them really
light really my just my skin really
really likes them my skin doesn't love
anything too heavy even at this time of
year when I really want radiance and I
really want hydration I still don't want
anything too heavy so this is perfect
their radiance face oil is a really
lightweight oils if you don't love oils
then don't worry this one is absolutely
fine even before makeup application I
mixed it in with my Liz Earle skin
Repair moisturizer for normal
combination skin that's a moisturizer
that I have been using pretty much every
day for the past month or so what I tend
to do especially if I've got a slightly
more luxurious base let's say or a
slightly thicker moisturizer on I'll
tend to leave it for about well as long
as possible really today I left at about
10 minutes
somedays I will go and blow-dry my hair
and which about half an hour
somedays are going to make the coffee or
whatever but today I left my base ten
minutes my skin to just absorb all those
ingredients and then I used a primer
Clarins have released a whole range of
primers there is one for pretty much
every skin need the one that I used is
from the SOS primer range the one I use
today was there one that blurs
imperfections let me show you the rest
of the products in the range as well so
this is like my little box of products
that I have been applying so far this is
the one that I just applied blowing
imperfections we've also got this one
here which visibly minimizes dark spots
so you can really just choose whichever
skin can
so you want to target this one visibly
brightens sallow skin and then we've got
one here for boosting radiance this is a
great one for this time of year and this
one diminishes redness you could even
just choose which area of the face you
want to apply them so you could put this
one on the cheeks but this one on the
forehead and any other areas so a really
lovely new selection of primers from
Clarins this is the next thing that I
applied as you can see it's personalized
which I absolutely love
it's got a really long name it's called
the my Armani to go essence in
foundation cushion SPF at 23 it did take
a little bit of building but the
coverage is rebuildable they describe it
as a soft matte finish which I would
agree with maybe maybe not 100% Maps got
a little bit of glow to it but yeah I
applied maybe a couple of layers I kept
going back over my cheeks to build up on
the coverage
it's got glycerin and hyaluronic acid in
there so it's really good for just
keeping the skin radiant and glowy and
very comfortable for this time of year
which is very very important and then
this little cushion I really like the
shape of X it's almost like it's not
completely round it's almost teardrop
shape if you can see that so it's very
good for getting into those areas like
around the nose under the eyes I just
found it very very practical so big fan
of this so far I did want to add a
little bit more warmth to the complexion
so I've used these souffle de plaids I
think that's the correct name
yes souffle dak lat loose powder from
YSL I'm not too familiar with a whole
load of wire sell products have not
tried that many but this one promises to
give you a glowing radiant complexion
all day long despite the fact that it's
a powder which is very intriguing to me
it's got a little powder puff
application so you just kind of tip it
upside down and then press it onto the
face and I actually think my skin is
looking fairly glowy considering I've
got powder all over it so very impressed
with this so far the next thing that I
applied was a lip glow from the Dior
Addict range they have introduced some
new shades in mats and holographic
finishes which is really intriguing this
one is my favorite the one that I
applied today and it is the shade coral
they're basically lip balms with a
beautiful bit of tint in them so great
if you want to add a little bit of color
without compromising on just a nice
barmy nourishing finish here are some of
the other shades that I've got you've
got matte raw
priam at pink and an ultra pink there
should also be a holographic pink which
is a little bit more similar in
consistency to the coral one but can I
find it anywhere no it is absolutely
vanished so hopefully that will turn up
in the not-too-distant future but I
absolutely love the packaging of these
really like the Bullitt really like the
fact that it comes in this pink
packaging I just think it's beautiful
and I really love pulling these out of
my handbag which is a simple pleasure
after the Dior lip balm I just put on
some of my usual bronzer I didn't have
any new bronzer to try out so I've just
popped on some of my bare minerals this
I think is quite a light bronze shade so
I use this one all over my face is not
particularly good for contouring or
anything like that but if you just want
to add warmth to the complexion then
that's a really really lovely one I do
also have from Lamarr very reflective
this is the bronzing powder and this one
is a little bit darker this one does
have some darker shades in there
obviously as you can see you can really
pick and mix you can use your brush at
the bottom for a lighter shade or really
bring it up to the top levels for a
darker shade and I like to just sweep it
across the top and then that'll give me
a little bit more of a deep color for
any face shaping and any contouring as
well so everything that I'd applied
before starting this video and now I'm
going to apply a few more new launches
this actually I'm not again sure if it's
new but it's new to me it's the bright
Harry
game lighter palette and I have pixie
nude as my shade range which sounds
absolutely perfect it's an absolute
beautiful palette as well so trying to
get into it to show you what it looks
like inside you've got pinky shades
you've got lots of Browns some metallic
Browns some matte Browns basically every
shade that I absolutely adore and we're
on an almost daily basis here's a closer
look you can see it also comes with a
brush inside as well to be honest this
looks like a pretty good one I normally
don't use the brushes that come with
palettes I normally use my own but I'm
going to give this one a try it's got a
nice shaped end and then more of a
blending end as well I would say that
these outer shades on the last three
here are the type of shades that I wear
on a daily basis and then if I want to
jazz it up a little bit in the evenings
that middle color is absolutely stunning
but I'm gonna start by applying this one
I think all over and then maybe building
up around the crease with this slightly
dark
Brown shade okay I don't actually feel
like this brush is doing these
eyeshadows any favors it's making it
look quite patchy on my eyelid and
taking a really long time to get that
wash of color so I'm gonna go and get
one of my usual brushes to give this
another go trying again with my zoeva
brushes is what I use on a daily basis
this one is the soft crease I'm gonna
try the eye shadow with this one okay so
I've applied the eye shadow the shades
are just very very wearable nots
ground-breaking shades but you know what
I think secretly 99% of the population
don't want groundbreaking shades we just
want colors that are really wearable for
every day that's definitely what I look
for in an eyeshadow palette so bite I
have absolutely ticked that box with
this palette I used a mixture of the
three that I showed you a second ago if
the brush even slightly touches that
middle shimmer you really do get a
lovely shimmering pop of color over the
top which is really really nice you
might want to use a slightly smaller
brush if you don't want any shimmer for
maybe a day look next I'm going to apply
some mascara I don't have a new one to
try out so I'm just gonna go with the
Old Faithful benefit roller lash this is
what I use the brown one is what I use
on a daily basis okay mascara is done
I'm now gonna take this opportunity now
that I'm looking a little bit more human
to tell you about today's giveaway so I
think that when I do these videos and
I'm going to try to do this kind of
testing new makeup video hopefully once
a month to really keep on top of all the
new launches maybe every two or three
weeks maybe every two months depends on
how many new products I have to try out
but I want to also incorporate giveaways
in these videos each month and just give
away a selection of products which I
have tried out in the video any products
that I think that you guys will love and
certainly products that I have got the
whole range of often Piazza's are very
very generous and they'll send the full
range of things many of which are not
suitable for my particular skin type
like I don't really have for example any
redness so the primer that deals with
redness is not one for me so I want to
give you guys the opportunity to try
them out as well and just say thank you
really for watching and engaging so what
I'm going to do is leave Liam
Meishan about the giveaway down below
but generally I'm gonna hopefully try to
give it to my most active subscribers
and active followers so if you're liking
a lot of my Instagram photos if you're
leaving lovely comments if you're
commenting on my videos giving them
thumbs up things like that obviously you
need to be subscribed to my youtube
channel and following me on Instagram

commenting on blog posts that kind of
thing that kind of thing is definitely
gonna help you out when it comes to the
giveaways and there is going to be a
hashtag hashtag fashion month of beauty
giveaway and it's someone that's going
to be using that hashtag that will win
so that is how you can enter my
giveaways each month so yeah that is
what's going to be happening each month
in these videos so these are the goodies
and I'm going to be giving away for this
month's fashion mumbler Beauty giveaway
I've got one of the Dior Addict lipglo
lipgloss limited edition Mother's Day
and a nail cream in Jasmine this is the
Clarins SOS primer which blurs
imperfections the new Clinique fit
moisturizer mattifying and for
post-workout I've also popped in one of
my favorite necklaces from accessorize
made with Swarovski crystal this is one
of the hourglass highlight sticks in
this gorgeous creamy rose gold shade
then you've got a Dermalogica bear
defense booster amazing at this time of
year of keeping the skin happy I've
popped in one of the new lip Envy's from
Estee Lauder and two colors if you are a
red lover or a pinky nude color there is
one for you these are the new matte lip
products from Laura Mercier so next I'm
going to move on to lips and there are
so many amazing lip products that I want
to try out this month I've already
showed you the Dior lip balm I've just
kind of blotted it a little bit so that
I can move on to the next product
something I'm really excited to try and
I think you guys will be really
interested in is the Finn T Beauty lip
launch I think these are called the
mademoiselle plush matte lipstick that's
just says underneath and i have gone for
the shade single i do have a couple more
shades one of which will be in the
giveaway selection so stay tuned this
one I would say is the most wearable
it's like a brownie pink which is very
much my color I think I might line the
lips first so I'm gonna go and grab a
lip liner before I apply this I'm just
using the Elizabeth
plump up lipliner this is one of my
favorites when I'm not too sure what the
lipstick color is going to be it's very
much kind of my lips but better and it's
really really soft so I love the
consistency of this one you can just see
how easily that goes on and then the
fenty beauty the packaging on this is
the Silver Bullet you can see and then
on the top of the lipstick
it's got FB emblazoned on there not
going to last very long but let's see
how this looks this is the shade single
I have to say I was not expecting that
to be as pigmented as it is it's a
really beautiful almost corally pink
it's like a cross between almost like a
terra cotta and a coral and brown it's
just the most unusual shade definitely
unlike anything I've got in my
collection which is great really nice
actually this would be a really nice
autumn lipstick but you know what I'm
gonna wear it throughout summer and
spring anyway even though it's got a
matte finish it is very comfortable it
doesn't feel drying it doesn't feel like
the kind of consistency that's going to
be long lasting on my lips but it does
promise that in the press release so we
will see I'll keep you updated I'm gonna
be filming clips for this vlog
throughout the day as I try out new
beauty products so we'll see how long
this lasts before we move away from lips
I want to show you some more new
launches this one is from Estee Lauder
this case you can actually get if you
buy six or more of the lip products from
Selfridges it's a limited edition case
and it's just absolutely stunning these
are the new pure color Envy paint on
liquid lip color they have got three
different finishes you've got a matte
finish like this one which is my
favorite this is the shade espresso no
it's not it's actually called bronze
leaf but I wore this one out for dinner
last night and I absolutely loved it it
was a little bit dry on the lips but not
uncomfortably so and just gave such an
amazing intense color absolutely love
that
also within the matte finishes we have
this one which is lava flow I feel like
a beautiful matte red lipstick as such
an iconic thing to have in your
collection and this to me is just a
perfect perfect red shade so huge huge
fan of that one as these are peels
fools some of them don't have the
correct names on them so this one I just
have a code which is a Hebe six don't
know if that'll help you in the shop
this is one of their metallic finishes
so the second of the three finishes and
as you can see hopefully my camera will
focus it's just got beautiful almost
gold pearlescent pigments in there which
are just the most heavenly and wearable
metallic shade this next one for me is
called 856 but it's slightly more of a
fuchsia pink again with those metallic
pigments in there then we move down to
these two we've got kind of like an ox
blood-red color and a beautiful pink
almost like a Barbie pink and these are
the vinyl finishes so these ones are a
wet look really impactful very highly
pigmented finish so depending on your
preference of finished I am still a
matte lover but determined to push a
boat out a little bit then these are
just absolutely stunning there's going
to be 18 different shades in total and I
think they're out now in Selfridges and
then one final lip launch this one is
from Laura Mercier look at this
incredible selection I think there are
24 new shades they are matte
inconsistency these kind of pinky brown
ones naturally are my favorites this one
here is called vibe and I actually wore
this one for their launch dinner which
was a couple of evenings ago Suki
Waterhouse is the face of this
collection and she was at the dinner so
it's really lovely to hear here her
makeup tips and all about her job
getting into the modeling industry along
with her makeup artist Katie who is also
really really lovely but yeah I will
this one throughout the dinner beautiful
shade really long lasting really
pigmented and but also very very
comfortable considering its matte not
drying at all and as you can see there
are just so many different shades to
choose from whether you like the Bright
Futures if you're more of a Coralie
lover and then we've got some slightly
more brownie shades this one is almost
like a coffee color and then we've even
got some Purple's some really vivid
purples and then this is almost like a
tomato red so again a really really
wearable red color because of the shape
of this applicator I just find it so
easy to pop on the lips don't even need
a mirror and they're obviously super
slim just like the lip caviar that we
all know and love from Norah Mercier so
great for popping in the handbag if you
just want to have a little bit of color
on
on the go then these are really lovely
obviously no human in the world can get
through so many lipsticks so one of
these or a couple of these will also be
in my giveaway selection so as I
mentioned earlier oil is just really
important at this time of year for
helping the skin looking lovely and
glowing this is a new launch from dar
fan and to me da fan are just the
Queen's of oil this is their new stress
relief detox oil mask which oh my
goodness lives absolutely haven't me the
main ingredient in this is vetiver which
has lovely skin renewing properties so
great if you need to just help the skin
to calm down if there's any irritation
going on and also just giving the skin
beautiful radiance I would probably
apply this before beds leave it on the
skin for maybe 10-15 minutes just let my
skin absorb all the goodness and then
they've also got the vetiver aromatic
care from their face oils these I've
been using for I don't know like 18
months in 82 years now in the evenings
it's just part of my evening routine if
I want to relax rewind just let my skin
enjoy the goodness from the oils and
inhale the amazing aromas you guys have
heard me talking about these and many
many times before so really excited for
this new innovation from da fam then we
have two new launches from sanctuary spa
these are foaming shower gels and I
absolutely love foaming shower gels
this time of year particularly good if
you're coming in from the cold into
central heating and your skin's a bit
stressed this one in particular I really
like it's got almond oil and I think
sunflower oil potentially in there but
it promises three-day long lasting
moisture which is great for this time of
year these are seven pounds which I
think it's fairly pricey considering
it's not like a design round but you
know what you only need a tiny bit of
foam it lasts a long time
great for shaving and just generally a
really lovely product to use in the
shower and these are available I believe
from boots so before we move on to
skincare I just have I think one more
Beauty launch to show you and these came
in an amazing set they are the hourglass
vanish flash highlighting sticks the
packaging of these is too honest a
little OTT it's absolutely gianormous
not one for space-saving make of drawers
but amazing and nonetheless they come in
these almost kind of pyramid
silver containers with hourglass written
on the side and then the actual
highlight itself is inside in a
triangular shape which you roll to bring
up I'm gonna give this a try I think you
apply this directly onto the skin I have
got the shade bronze flash here I would
automatically presume these are for
highlighting but you can also use them
on the lips on the eyelids they've got
some really beautiful pearlescent pinky
shades some more creamy shades so very
very versatile which is what you want
when you are paying in the luxury price
tag of our glass products very very
smooth consistency so let's apply that
straight on to my cheekbone and then I'm
just gonna blend that out with my
fingers this has actually given quite a
lot of color so if you want to use this
almost as a bronzer maybe it's a little
bit too dark for a highlight I'm going
to look a little bit odd applying a
different one on different cheeks but
this one is rose gold flash it looks
almost like a key in the bullet but
let's see how this looks I'm really
basic when it comes to highlight not
particularly skilled in that area but
just using my fingers to blend this in
it seems to be a very easy way to do it
and actually that highlight is beautiful
that has just given a really really
lovely you can see it's slightly warmer
on this side and slightly cooler on this
side just given a really lovely natural
glow to my complexion so I'm gonna
finish by whizzing through some new
skincare launches one that I'm probably
the most excited about is this one from
Liz Earle there cleanse and polish in a
new fragrance or flavor this is the
lavender and vetiver excusive exclusive
to John Lewis the fragrance of this one
is ice obviously still got that cleanse
and polish scent to it but it's a little
bit more calming because the lavender
it's got that kind of woody scent to it
as well personally I'm really loving
using this for my evening cleanse I just
find it very very soothing and then
obviously cleanse and polish I
absolutely love it's a lovely rich cream
that gets rid of any grime on the
complexion any makeup leaves you with a
really lovely smooth balanced skin and
then in the pot you also get the
cleansing cloth or actually two
cleansing cloths obviously you just use
these with warm water to gently buffer
the product off the skin and that just
very gently exfoliates any dead skin
cells off leaving you with a
the radiant complexion we have two new
sheet masks out in the market from
Kiehl's and Elizabeth Arden both of
these masks are made from a bio
cellulose material so it's kind of I
think this one is made from coconut
water that's been fermented so it's like
feels almost like a second skin on your
face and both of them are two-part masks
so they don't fall off they fit the skin
really really closely the Kiehl's one is
their instant renewal concentrate mask
it's a blend of three different from the
Amazonian Brazilian rainforest and it's
also got omega-6 fatty acid in there
which helps to replenish the skin and
also helps to build up the skins
protective layer so again fantastic at
this time of year these are available in
Harrods and I think they're 44 pounds
for a box of four of those the Elizabeth
Arden ones are a new addition to the
superstar collection which I'm a huge
fan of these are the probiotic boost
skin renewal bio cellulose masks because
of the probiotics as you can imagine
it's all about just helping to build up
the skins resilience resilience against
pollution against any irritation
hyaluronic acid in their renews the skin
helps it stay lovely and smooth and
radiant and once again the mask itself
you get four in here and I think that's
40 pounds before the clinic fit launch
has been a really exciting launch this
month I have tried their facial mist so
far it's in my gym bag and really really
liked it great for just refreshing the
skin after a workout this is their shine
in the game and not your t-zone
post-workout mattifying moisturizer they
all come in this really cool packaging
very bright very memorable and then this
is fabulous for just getting rid of any
glow that you may have after workout but
still a really lovely skin loving
moisturizer and last but not least
Karin's have some beautiful launches for
Mother's Day these are just my favorites
this is first of all just the packaging
is so stunning it's got this lovely
almost like hand-drawn floral design
this is their Magnolia hand and nail
treatment cream and then I've also
picked out their natural lip Perfector
this is the instant light natural lip
Perfector in this beautiful pink shade
and this collection has been
specifically created for Mother's Day so
if like me your mama absolutely
loves Clarins then these are just some
really lovely limited editions to treat
her to so those are some of my favorite
new launches that have come out over the
past couple of months or are coming out
in the not-too-distant future I hope you
enjoyed this kind of vlog style of
getting ready with me and trying
everything out real first impressions so
let me know if you like this format or
if you'd like me to do a different
format next month I am now going to get
ready to film another video so I need to
blow-dry my hair and actually one final
launch because I'm trying out a new hair
dryer this one is from t3 it's their
featherweight compact I think it's
called like a tourmaline soft air hair
dryer basically it's really lightweight
it collapses down it's got two different
wattage settings so really good for
traveling and it's got three heat
settings two style settings basically
all the snazzy nuts of a normal hair
dryer that's super lightweight and
compact so I'm gonna give this a go get
my hair ready and dry ready to start
filming but I really hope you enjoyed
this video and I will see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
