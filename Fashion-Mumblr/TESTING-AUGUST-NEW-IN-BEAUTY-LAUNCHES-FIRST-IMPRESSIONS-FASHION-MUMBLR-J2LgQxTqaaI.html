hi guys welcome back today's video is
going to be my August new in and I
realize that I have majorly neglected
these videos I have not done one for
quite a while but to be honest I always
find I'm a little bit bolon away by the
new launches a little bit overwhelmed by
them but this month there have been a
few that I have cherry-picks and there's
probably eight or so products here that
I have tested and when to share with you
a few first impressions so I'm going to
get straight stuck in there and the
first new launch that I'm excited about
this month is the origins
clear improvements active charcoal
exfoliating cleansing powder charlie
night are both huge fans of a clear
improvement mark it's the dark one
you've probably seen it on both of our
Instagram stories a million times so I
was very very excited to try out their
exfoliating powder this is not gonna
light a little bit roughly to you if you
basically put a little bit of the powder
into your hands and a bit of water rub
your hands together and pop it on your
face I've only used this one but I was
very impressed with how my skin felt
afterwards it's not a major exfoliator
it's more of a cool cleanser the active
charcoal acts like a magnet and it
really draws out any dirt any oil any
old makeup in your pores even rupaul's a
lot tighter and your skin just looks and
feels a lot more clean and a lot more
smooth afterwards so first impressions
of this were very positive so this has
got booboo charcoal in it which
basically works to absorb hundreds of
times its own weight and impurities but
really does help to draw out that that
from your skin very similar effect to
the face mask but we all know and love
this one is 25 pounds and is out this
month I think everything by one thing by
mentioning this video is out now but I
will leave all the information and links
other ways that an inscription box so
you guys know it goes for more info
another new launch this month which I'm
very excited about is a designer
collaboration so to meet have teamed up
with Jonathan Adler and they've released
a limited edition range of products
including this which is my favorite it
is the iconic Clinique a sonic cleansing
brush which has this amazing variance
Campbell geometric pattern all over it
this one also comes with a travel case
and affirming cleanser and yeah I'm
really loving using this so far very
gentle and great for removing your main
part I also just used it to remove the
origins cleansing powder so very very
versatile the whole range has the
beautiful colorful geometric patterns
all over it and the range is inspired by
Jet Set brown which is reflected in some
of the product names for example you've
got the Santorini lip pop which is one
of the lip shades is also eye shadows
brush set basically a few of Lenexa most
iconic and best-selling products have
been updated with this really summery
and colorful pattern so definitely want
to check out in addition we make a
really nice gift for any beauty lovers
and yes this is by far my favorite from
the new collection so a lot of the new
in skincare this month has a bit of a
skin resurfacing slash exfoliating theme
to it because the next new launch which
I'm very much looking forward to using
more of is the update of the Nippon fab
glycolic fix gentle pad so you may have
tried these before but now they come in
a more gentle sensitive version so it's
great if you do have sighting on
sensitive skin or if you do like use
them on a regular basis these are
infused with glycolic acid and fruit
acids so it helps to cleanse the pores
and exfoliate the skin in a more gentle
way these ones also have aloe vera in
them and as we all know our mirror is
great for soothing the skin so just
generally a lot better for your skin if
you are a little bit more sensitive side
but still want to get the benefits of a
resurfacing products next up is a brand
that I have not tried before it is
called Sun a floor sander for a I'm not
too sure on Oprah next correct
pronunciation and it is the French brand
and it is inspired by nature
proven by science basically these
products are certified organic you'll
find a lot of botanical oils and natural
essences in there the two that I have
been loving the most firstly Aqualand
magnifica
this to me I guess is a more botanical
toner so I use the offer of cleanser
skin and it's filled oils it's skin
perfecting it helps to finish off your
cleansing kind off but also just balance
and make your skin look more radiant it
does have a really lovely botannical
smell to it and overall I would just say
it helps
a little bit more radiance to the
complexion and then after that I've been
using they're very stable over floral
isn't basically an organic ancient rose
water so rose water is great for
smoothing and soothing the skin you can
apply it as a mix to your face after
cleansing and toning which is what I
mostly do but also you can apply it over
the body after you get out the shower
haven't done that yet but I probably
will do so this is a really lovely new
addition to my skincare routine
priorities are not very sensible I think
this one is about 14 pound 50 and this
one is under 10 pounds so very
affordable for organic skin care this is
a new knowledge that I was very excited
to try it is the Animus probe collagen
marine oil so it's a new addition to the
incredible pro-collagen range which I'm
huge channelled as are millions of
people across the world
I think the pro-collagen cleansing balm
sells one every nine seconds I think
something bonkers like that but this is
a new addition to the range at this
month it is 65 pounds and it contains a
trio of seaweed algae ingredients
basically worked moisturizer skin
reduced any fine lines and wrinkles
there's a long term and it does have
immediate skin radiance effects also
long-term benefits as well for me this
kind of reminds me of the benefits that
you get from a lot of lemare photos
obviously this and Allah now as both
have seaweed extract in them and that's
what really helps to rejuvenate the skin
so do you suggest that you can use this
morning and evening three or four drops
apply it before the serums and your
moisturizers so it's not replacing
anything in your routine it's more
adding something new into your routine
personally I've just been using this in
the evenings because I do find that one
is a very light oil it does take maybe
five to ten minutes to sink into the
skin and I don't know about you but I
just have no patience in the morning so
instead I've been putting this on in the
evenings after I take my makeup off and
then putting my night creams on a little
bit later one of the ingredients in here
is golden seaweed which helps to protect
the skin against environmental
aggressors so not only you're getting
the moisturizing and nourishing benefits
from the oil but your skin is also
getting protective so overall just a
very hard working and multitasking
product as it's an oil it's obviously
very pampering I would like to put a
little bit in my hands rub it together
and
just inhale the amazing fragrance and
then anything that's left on my hands I
could rub into my nails and it helps to
keep the cuticles nice and moisturized
so many many benefits to this I've only
been using it for like five days already
falling in love with it I'm looking
forward to seeing the long-term benefits
of using this as well next up is a new
launch which is actually launching it
today and is a new yarn and deliciously
Ella
collaboration or increase on their
existing collaborations they already
have a face wash and exposure to turn
everything but these are for the body so
you've got a body wash and a body lotion
charlie has already managed to use news
have of the body wash which I'm not from
used about but it has this gorgeous rose
Liman shoes and the scent which is very
uplifting fresh and very just
mouth-watering is the best way to
describe it personally I have been going
through the body lotion and it's just a
really lovely quite thick I could take
quite a while to rub in but my skin
feels so soft and not sticky afterwards
so a big fan of this formula obviously
because it's designed in collaboration
with unjust Reata it's all super fresh
organic ingredients as we expect from
your dr remedies so yeah it's kind of
best if you haven't already smelt the
range just going to business because
it's so so good alright so now we're
moving on to makeup and first of all I
have to let you guys know about this
incredible foundation the electric from
bare minerals I've been using this since
I got back from France so under a week
but already just photos are impressed
with this unlike most foundations which
I'll probably have a negative impact on
your skin by clogging up the pores just
want to actually improve skin texture
appearance over time so it's actually
doing good to your skin which is
incredible standing my coverage very non
lasting it does promise 24-hour wear but
let's be honest whoever put that to the
test I certainly have not worn it for 24
hours but I just ask that you love the
finish of this I'm wearing it today I
find that after an hour once your skin
has kind of merged with the foundation
it just gives you the most beautiful
glow
although it is technically a matte
finish foundation it has bamboo extract
and then of course the mineral pigments
that we know and love for bare mineral
products in there that really have to
blow the skin and personally I just find
this an incredibly comfortable for it to
wear I
all day get the benefits and coverage
from the high coverage nurse office so I
can wear this all day and get the
benefits of the high coverage folks and
yet I can't feel it on the skin because
sometimes especially if you're spending
the day working in the city and you do
want that quite courage foundation it
just feels like it's bare on your skin
and you just want to get home and
exfoliate but I do not get that with
this this is available in 30 shades so
hopefully we'll be I'll find a color for
our skin type and it's going to be 29
pounds out on the 24th of this month in
Germans exclusively and then early
September nationwide so highly highly
recommend this and you'll probably hear
me raving about this even more my
Instagram stories so definitely make
sure you follow me on instagram for
regular updates I have tried it with the
bare minerals luxe performance brush
this one is sold separately I think this
is 24 pounds and it's shaped
specifically to get into those
hard-to-reach areas around the nose and
the eyes and I kind of feels like a
stippling motion to get that finish so
it's made with hypoallergenic and
synthetic fibers so no animal fibers in
there whatsoever but really good at
blending out that specific foundation I
do I've always like to finish off with
my Beauty Blender just get that totally
flawless flawless finish from big
benefit and together cream combination
the next thing that I use this morning
because what's on my face now is what
I'm talking about is the L'Oreal
paradise brow comb and this is a new
launch from L'Oreal it's 999 million
boots and first of all packaging it is
rogue goldie pinky tone outfit beautiful
and I would actually compare this to the
anastasia dipbrow I am very impressed
with the colors of beads I have got the
shade
warm blonde which is actually not the
lightest but this one is kind of an ashy
color we're trying to find a really
natural in the lid you have got this
slanted brow brush which is actually
superfine what I find is a lot of these
affordable one is actually a little bit
thick so you can't get that precise
shape but this one I'm a big fan of and
the product itself which is in there I
find it very long-lasting I when I first
try this wear all day no smudging is a
matte formula
hi
pigment is very easy to apply and yes
they found about really good if you want
to get that perfect Braille finish but
don't want to spend all that money on
the anastasia version also it in that
range is the lash paradise once again
beautiful rose gold packaging this has
been super hyped up in the state and now
finally available here in the UK as well
this has been compared to the Too Faced
better than sex mascara and it's
actually been called it better than best
in sex and it has got lash loving at
castor oil inside it which basically
work to nourish and condition and keep
the lashes a nice and soft and at the
same time it doesn't flake it feels very
comfortable to wear and personally I've
actually still not tried it on on
totally clean lashes every time I've
used it I've had a little bit of
something on my lashes to begin with but
even with something on my lashes I felt
you very voluminous or volumizing and
really nice intense colors so big fan so
far but very much looking forward to try
this on totally fair lashes to give even
more definition and care to the lashes
another super Hydra product which has
launched this month is the naked he had
it I'm a big fan of Naked palette and
especially the the third one that was in
the gold yeah I think there's the one
that I spoke about in like every video
last year this is a new one and just
released this month and inside you can
see a really beautiful section of very
warm with Anne Marie Brown shades you've
got a mixture of Mac you've got some
shimmers light all the way down to a
surprisingly wearable ready brown
shimmery shade they're very rich colors
but thankfully very blendable I
specifically really liked the brush it
comes with it's very rare to find
eyeshadow palette that comes with a nice
brush but this one I do genuinely really
like using and if you are a neutral
eyeshadow lover like myself but you do
want to push arose out a little bit then
these are very very wearable shades I
use the darker shade which is ember and
on crease and I use the lighter shades
including chaser and source just to
create a bit of definition and create a
smooth base to begin with to blend in my
oven decay eye shadows I use the powder
brush from the Real Techniques new
powder glove collection which is a very
luxurious new range from Real Techniques
exclusive to boots and the range is all
designed for time your powder in a way
that doesn't dislodge your makeup every
single brush is just the softest brush I
have ever felt and I've got a couple of
really beautiful shapes of bigger and
smaller domed one and the powder brush
which I used to end in my eyeshadow this
one is 15 pounds so not as affordable as
the rest of the Real Techniques ranges
and you definitely can tell they're
spending a little bit more because the
quality of these brushes is just
absolutely incredible
Bobby Brown have released a new
concealer all around for me is a real go
to brand when it comes to concealer I'm
a big fan of their under-eye creamy
concealer always having in my handbag
and this one is their instant full cover
concealer so the applicator is this
little goat foot it's not planted but I
actually find a little bit harder to
apply so as you might be able to get
from the name it is high coverage and
it's supposed to be crease free longwear
concealer to be honest I found that I
did have to blend it quite a lot
I've been trying that it merged with my
skin straight away upon application but
then when I took a step back in the
mirror I did really like the effect I
haven't worn it all day yet so I will
keep you updated as to how long wearing
it is did find a couple of creases to
start with but now they'll blend it out
fingers crossed
it will stay what it does do however is
really brighten and refresh the eye area
I just constantly have a base and I did
find this made my tired eyes look a lot
more radiant so from that angle very
much impressed a bit and it is 23 pounds
and found now next we have a beautiful
lipstick launched from hourglass this is
their confession we have the longest
name in the world in fact I'm going to
have to read it from my notes it is the
confession ultra slim high intensity
refillable lipstick that is a name and a
half but the exciting ones that is
refillable which i think is very very
cool for lipstick to be refillable and
great because this packaging is gorgeous
and you would never want to get rid of
it the consistency is very creamy it's
almost barmy
to apply it and because it is so small
it's very precise you almost don't need
to wear lip liner with this shade why
they have nude they have paints I've got
some movie colors and some red so at the
beautiful shade range as eye surgery
creamiest got kind of satiny finish
supposed to be long wearing again I've
not really put it to much the test but
keep nama into Android for update and
this one is 28 pounds get on it Porter
and it is out now last but not least we
have a new fragrance launch for the
month the BFF of fragrances Nina and
Luna are now out in a limited edition
sweet corn nd so I think it's a
technical name for these ranges they've
got a sweet sprinkling on top the
packaging is absolutely beautiful in the
tree looks like hundreds and thousands
decorates on top the Nina fragrance is
very sweet kind of got a good sweet shop
smell to it if you don't like sweet
fragrances I'm not going to be one for
you because it is very very sweet but
still very fresh and summery at the same
time and whereas Luna I would say it's
almost a little bit more kind of
caramely if that makes sense it's just a
lot smoother I personally think is a
little bit more wearable which is funny
because for the original fragrances more
of a Nina girl but yeah I think with
this particular preparation I'm
definitely urging on the luna side if
you are a fan of the Nina Ricci
fragrances and I think that these are
definitely worth a smell and other
certainly most editions so don't turn
around with these pretty little perfumes
so those are a few of my favorite
launches for the month of August I
really hope you guys enjoy looking
through these with me let me know you'd
like me to continue doing these kind of
videos because I know as I said that did
let them slide a little bit and also
please let me know in the comments down
below what launches you are most excited
