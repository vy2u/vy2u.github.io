joining me for today's video it's going
to be my February new in beauty launches
video so as I did last month for January
I'm going to be chatting about all the
beauty products that I love that have
launched throughout the month of
February and also sharing with you some
first impressions of products and I am
in yet to try so that's why I'm looking
a little bit bare face at the moment
because I thought for those that I
haven't tried out yet we can do it
together and I can let you know my first
impressions so because I've got quite a
lot of products to talk about in today's
video I'm gonna get straight stuck in
there but before I do just a quick note
thank you guys
so much to everyone that has subscribed
already and having me reach that 100k
milestone it really is just quite
surreal for me and if you haven't
subscribed yet then I would love it if
you'd click that little red button down
there and then you won't miss any of my
future videos so the first brand that
I'm going to talk about is sport FX this
is a brand I've not heard of before I
think it's a new brand to the market and
they kindly sent me this heart-shaped
box filled with a few of their key
products so this range has been designed
for women that live a busy and dynamic
lifestyle and they want their makeup and
skincare to suit that lifestyle so a lot
of this is kind of sport focus so you've
got a really long-lasting mascara this
is called the sport of stamina
eight-hour mascara
you've got a face off makeup remover
wipes so really good to keep in your gym
bag there's also a recovery lip balm a
lot of the products have ingredients in
them to help the skin recover from after
a workout or a busy stressful day
another one of those is the cooldown
primer so that's what I'm going to apply
first this one has got vitamin complex
EC and F as well as aloe vera for adding
a little bit of protection to your skin
and helping to cool it down calm it down
after workout I was in the gym this
morning so really good timing to try
this out I just put a couple of pumps on
my
it's kind of like a watery gel
consistency and is lovely and cooling
very fresh less silicone II feeling than
things like laura mercier or the benefit
primer so yeah really nice if the skin
is a little bit stressed out which it
can be after a gym session so it says on
the back that you can apply that before
your workout and it'll help keep the
skin cool during the workout I do have
that like tingly feeling on my skin at
the moment which would be really nice
during the gym but hopefully because my
skin can be a little bit kind of red and
aggravated after workout hopefully
that'll be really nice for keeping it
cooled throughout the rest of the day
it's getting my hair out my face before
we apply some foundation all right so a
foundation real orange so I'm really
excited about this month is the Bourjois
healthy mix this is the anti fatigue
foundation when I was younger I used to
really love the bourgeois 10 hour sleep
effect and I think this is kind of like
the most similar version of that that's
out on the market today so it's all
about giving the skin a nice radiance
boost and the ingredients in this all
about like enriching and also calming
the skin so that's definitely a theme
for a few of the launches this month the
formula contains apricot for radiance
melon for hydration and also apple for
preserving the look of youth and so far
I'm really liking how this is looking on
my skin it's giving a really lovely
fairly high coverage I'd say but it
still looks like skin it definitely
doesn't look cakey which is a kind of
consistency that I love and without
doubt you can definitely see some
radiance coming through in fact this
does seem pretty similar to that ten
hours sleep effect about apps it used to
love when I was in school all that time
ago so I'm just using a Beauty Blender
to really make sure that's all blended
in properly taking it under my jawline
and right up to my hairline it's only
taken a few moments and this is
blended pretty well and then to finish
off the base I'm going to use the
Bourjois healthy mix anti fatigue
concealer with vitamin mix so this is
the matching concealer I've got the
shade 51 which is light and I'm hoping
that the anti fatigue does what it says
on the tin because my eyes especially
after Fashion Week are definitely in
need of a little bit of a boost with
under-eye concealer I normally like to
start by patting it in with a finger and
then I'll make sure it's perfectly
blended with my pasty blender afterwards
okay I'm really really pleased with how
that looks is the lovely light shade so
it's made my eye area look much brighter
and more awake which is the ultimate
goal of 94t concealer I say both the
foundation and the concealer got a
really lovely light texture really
blendable it seems to have blended into
my skin really easily the products of
blending in together really easily and
I'd say my skin that definitely looks
radiant and feels nice and hydrated so
as far as doing what it says on the tin
I am very impressed so far by the you
launches from Bourjois alright next up
I'm going to do my brows and I'm going
to be using the new Rimmel brow this way
three-in-one soft powder these were
launched on February the 15th and
they're $5.99 so incredibly affordable
I'm going to use the lightest shade this
is number 24 and what makes you so
special is they are this really super
soft powder formula so incredibly
comfortable to wear I've not worn one
for a full day before so this is going
to be my first proper test of these but
they do promise 24-hour wear even saying
they're waterproof and humidity proof
okay so that was really really quick and
easy I would say that I personally
prefer the effect of a brow pencil just
because I can really create hair like
strokes in my eyebrows or if you already
have a really good shape to your brows
and you just want to add a little bit
more color a little bit more definition
then that's what this would be really
good for for me I prefer to have more
hair like strokes having said that it
was super super quick and easy color
payoff is really good considering it's a
powder and hopefully the fact that it is
a powder is what's gonna make it so
long-lasting so I'll keep you guys
updated and then for my eyeshadow I'm
going to go in with one of the shades
from the Kat Von D by Too Faced
collaboration so this is a collaboration
that I don't think anyone was expecting
but the founders of Kat Von D and Too
Faced are best of friends apparently and
they decided to combine forces for some
of these limited edition sets out this
month this set here is the better
together set and it's got six eyeshadows
from each of the brands as well as the
iconic Too Faced better than sex mascara
and also the Kat Von D tattoo liner so
let's open it up this is my first time
even looking inside here and from the
side we're gonna go for palette itself
is this beautiful heart shape and then
inside you can see the Too Faced side as
well as the Kat von connecter Kat Von D
side which has obviously got the darker
colors and a lot more intense as per the
usual Kat Von D style I think for
today's look I'm gonna go in with friend
spiration from the Too Faced palette as
well as power couple so I'm just
applying the friend spiration shade all
over the eyelid it's a really lovely
kind of gold and brown shade a little
bit more apricot even I'd normally go
for an everyday basis I'm really liking
that warm color so far okay now that my
lids are covered in the friend spiration
I'm gonna go in with power couple which
is as gorgeous slightly darker brown
shade also nice and shimmery I'm just
gonna get a little bit less of that on
my brush and I'm going to apply that
into the crease to really intensify this
eye look as with all two-faced
eyeshadows they're just the most
beautiful consistency almost creamy how
light they are really nice and blendable
and super shimmery which is just
gorgeous whereas if you look at the cap
on D side the shades oh okay so they
break in half did not know that yeah on
the Kat Von D side you've got some more
matte shades as well if that's more your
thing
in fact I'm gonna take some of
lovestruck and just put that underneath
the brow bones just add a subtle lift to
the brow area and now to finish off the
eye look I'm going to use rimmel's of
volume shake this is a new mascara
launched it's actually not coming until
March but I've been trying it out over
the past couple of weeks I thought I
would share with you guys in today's
video so this one as you can see is a
little bit different to the usual
mascara style actually looks a little
bit like a cocktail shaker and as I said
with the brows it really is all about
shaking so this one is made up with
special ingredients which reactivate and
freshen themselves up when you shake it
see absolutely have to shake up this
mascara before you apply it and it helps
the ingredients within it or the
foreigner inside to not get clumpy
because there is nothing worse than
having to chuck away your favorite
mascara when it goes clumpy the brush
itself is really big and bristly so
hopefully it's going to help us achieve
really nice big voluminous lashes the
packaging for this one really is quite
large and a little bit heavier and than
a lot of my other mascaras so for that
reason I wouldn't take this one
traveling or in any overnight bags but I
think for a drugstore mascara to have
the kind of innovations that this one
has got it is very impressive I've only
had this one open for maybe three or
four weeks so I can't really comment on
the clumpiness but having said that
every time I apply it it does feel very
fresh just like applying a new mascara
so the formula that seems to be working
I'm going to apply another coat now just
to really build up an intense lash look
and because the formula is such an
intense black I haven't added any
eyeliner at the moment I'm just finding
eyeliner a little bit harsh and when the
formula of your mascara is as black as
this sometimes I just leave it out
completely next up is lips and a really
exciting lip launch this month is the
they're real double the lip from benefit
so this is a new addition to their real
range obviously so far we've got the
mascara and the eyeliner and the whole
range is designed to intensify we've got
make your assets look bigger bolder more
full
and that's exactly what these do for the
lips so it's a lipliner and a lipstick
in one and it's designed to give your
lips a real fullness and volume that
potentially maybe a similar effect to
getting a lip injection or that kind of
thing
so the product itself comes in a
teardrop shape this one is one of my
favorite shapes its lusty rose and at
the top of the teardrop you've got a
darker shade which acts as a liner and
then underneath that you've got a
complimentary shade which really helps
to make the lips look at the fullest
possible the formula says semi matte but
I'm all kind of compare this to a barley
consistency which does mean that they're
not terribly long-lasting but they are
very comfortable on the lips a lot more
comfortable than and matte so as you can
see that's added a really lovely color
to my lips you've got the darker shade
around the outside you do have to kind
of flip it upside down when you do the
bottom lip and do it a little bit more
step-by-step whereas on the top lip it's
just kind of one that swipe and you're
done
consistency wise really really
comfortable on the lips and because of
those two shades it definitely has made
my lips look bigger and bolder which is
the idea of their real range
I do wish they bring out a few more of
these like nudie colors because I did
find that this one and the one that's
just I think it's called nude are the
only two that I really love so hopefully
these will be a success and they'll
bring out lots of new colors because the
shade the idea the consistency is really
nice so far I just like to see a little
bit more of the wearable nudes from
benefit another lip launch which does
have a lot more colors that I adore to
choose from is the new pretty Stix from
C arte so I've got a few here and I
think I'm going to apply it this one
which is the shade BFFs I'm going to
apply this one they are apparently a
mermoo butter lipstick so they've got a
lot of conditioning treatments in there
which I just love anything that can that
save my lips remain chapped after the
winter is a big tick from me packaging
wise I love them they are these silver
bullets with lip prints all over them so
really really cute and it's just like an
roll up lipstick as you can see this
shade is absolutely gorgeous very me and
because they are this conditioning
treatment I think it's so good to just
sticking a handbag and apply on the go
so I'm going to pop this over the top of
the benefit and just to give you an idea
of the color so as you can see the color
is a little bit more intense and
incredibly intense considering this as a
bomb so these are really conditioning
formula if you'd like me suffer from
chapped lips but still don't want to
compromise on the color of your lips and
I think these are a really good option
and these are new out this month you'll
catch me with one of these in my handbag
at all times definitely a new favorite
for me and now seeing as I'm kind of
running out of room on my face I'm gonna
move on it to some non makeup launches
this month this is actually not a new
launch but this is the g HD v styler and
it's the one which is a little bit
bigger than the normal stylist so great
if like me you've got a lot of hair and
it takes you quite a long time to
straighten it these are the slightly
larger size you can still obviously
straighten and curl the hair in the same
way but for me I find it takes much less
time but what's so special about this
this month is that you actually get a
free gift with purchase you get the
advanced split and therapy which is a
savior especially if you've got bleached
hair or colored hair or if you just
suffer from split ends in general this
is such a lovely product I like to apply
it on my hands a little bit damp it
conditions the ends and stops those
split ends from getting any worse if you
start using it straight after going to
the hairdresser then hopefully you'll be
going a lot longer without any split
ends so at the moment that is the free
gift with purchase for this so I thought
I'd also mention that in this video
because it's such a great offer and a
really good time to pick up the styler
if you don't already have one and a
couple of really exciting fragrance
launches as month as well one that you
might have spotted on my Instagram
already is this one which is Daisy by
Marc Jacobs and this one is their kiss
fragrance which is new for this month
for bottle as you can imagine is just
absolutely gorgeous this one has got the
flowers on the lid
show you the other bottles in a second
this one is just really perfect for
those that like a floral scent but
nothing too sickly and sweet this one's
got peony and rose in there so it's a
very soft floral very very wearable plus
it looks absolutely gorgeous on your
bedside table so this one at kiss is a
new launch for this month as well the oh
so fresh kiss is a very very similar
scent bottle it is a little bit
different I will show you this one it's
a little bit taller this one's also got
white wood and sandalwood see even more
musky I think if you want something a
little bit more grown-up and even more
wearable then this would be the one to
go for but once again I just absolutely
love the packaging of these so
spectacular to have on your dressing
table or in your handbag or anywhere and
then finally from this collection we
have got Daisy dream kiss so this one is
a slightly more pared back bottle only
slightly it's still just a spectacular
and this one is a lot more fruity it's
got pineapple in there I think it's got
blackcurrant and also grapefruit it's a
note that you can really smell quite
strongly on this one so Marc Jacobs
really have got you covered with all
their new launches this month the whole
range I just absolutely adore not just
because they're pink but definitely try
and smell the three new launches if you
can if you happen to be near a counter
because I really think there's one for
every kind of perfume at preference and
also I had to tell you guys about a new
fragrance from Viktor and Rolf
Flowerbomb as you may know it's probably
my all-time favorite fragrance one that
I wore all the time in my early twenties
I still reach for it now this one is the
flower bomb bloom so perfect timing for
spring the bottle is a little bit taller
feet scent itself is a lot lighter but
equally as like recognizable and just
amazing as the original flower bomb you
definitely still got that like musky
base that you know and love from flower
bomb I think it's vanilla and patchouli
are the main
in that but it's somehow a little bit
more Airy a little bit more fresh
uplifting but still a beautifully floral
so really really lovely one for spring
and I just can't decide whether and this
or the Margie because it's going to be
my everyday fragrance I absolutely love
both of them and I'm really excited to
switch that between the two for my
spring fragrances and now because I
don't want this video to get too long
I'm going to whiz through a few of my
other favorite launches Too Faced and
skinny-dip got together that they kindly
sent me this pencil case which I wish
I'd happen I was in school because I
used to love cool pencil cases and this
one is amazing
do you still have to have clear pencil
cases when you go into exams not show
off this and qualify but really really
cool collaboration from Too Faced and
skinny-dip some new body care launches
from the body shop I love anything
almond and honey related so when I heard
about this one new it's gonna be a
favorite this is a almond milk and honey
carrying a bath milk and then you've
also got the body cream it's a match as
you can imagine if like me you love
those scents fragrances for these are
just incredible and ice everything that
I'm gonna talk about for today for my
new in February on Chism first
impressions let me guys know if you like
this style where I'm applying them on my
face and I'm sorry if I seem distracted
