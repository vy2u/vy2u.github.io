joining me for today's video today I'm
going to be going through a few new
Beauty launches Beauty news that kind of
thing there's so many pieces that I have
been dying to try out recently and I was
planning on applying them or trying them
all this morning if I thought I would do
it on camera so I can let you know a few
first impressions
I know these videos can sometimes get
really really long so I'm going to try
and be as brief as possible and I'm just
going to get straight stuck in there
with a really fantastic gift with
purchase this month so Harrods do a
liquid purchase every May and this year
I think it's my favorite one ever so
it's quite a luxurious one as you can
imagine you have to spend over 250
pounds in the beauty haul but if you do
this month then you will be rewarded
with this beautiful envelope and it's
full to the brim with amazing luxury
products and this is actually worth 350
pounds so if you are looking to invest
in some beauty at the moment then it has
a really good place to do that so inside
the some lucky products including a
diptych candle you've got a rose your
lip mask a keels amino acid shampoo
loading loads of things I will leave a
link to this down below I'm actually
going to try some other pieces from this
for the first pieces I apply this
morning so from that gifted purchase I'm
going to be trying these Shiseido's
power infusing concentrate and this is a
serum so what I really love about these
gifts with purchase is that you get
little travel minis and they're just so
just sort of you putting in your whole
bag but also it's a really nice way of
trying brows you may have tried before I
tried a few things from rishi Sado but
not this particular serum it's got a
really lucky scent to it so if you are
looking to invest in some higher-end
products then mini-sized like this is a
really great way to introduce you to
them this has sunk in pretty much
straight away I think this is a good one
for 500 wrinkles helps the skin defend
itself from environmental stresses and
for me living in London that's really
important and apparently makes your
wrinkles less noticeable so I'm all up
to that another mini that comes in the
Harris Kieffer's purchase
is this tiny little it by Terry Baume De
Rose you guys know how much I love this
and I always apply it just before
putting on my makeup just to make sure
magnets and lovely in moisturize before
lipstick later on it's terrific way to
prepare the lip this is a different
color it's the one that I've currently
got so a nice new one to try sorry about
the lighting changes by the way I'm
filming in natural daylight and it's
that day when it's 26 degrees outside so
if I look a little bit and hot and
flustered that's because I am so with my
lips masking moisturized next I'm going
to move on it's your eye cream this is a
new and from bareMinerals it's called
their skin longevity vital power eye gel
cream powered by long-lived herb with
California Poppy and then foo Yoong I
have repaired that right ginger extract
so let's give this a go I think they
said that this one it's kind of freezing
any aging effects on your eyes I have
been a big fan of all the bareMinerals
skincare I've tried so far treiber's
serums X lenses this is really
lightweight hopefully it will acts
against the puffiness on my eyes as well
feels really refreshing which is
definitely something I need on a day
like today and then give that a few
seconds to sink in and hence my
moisturizer another new launch this one
is from Burt's Bees who finally have
bought their skincare to the UK this is
their daily moisturizing cream and it's
perfect for sensitive skin it's
fragrance free algae tested proven to
moisturizers to skin without causing
redness or irritation sounds good
especially when you know we all have
those days or weeks when just anything
can irritate your skin I feel like this
is going to be a really good one to
reach for on those kinds of days I'm not
going to put too much on my hand so
don't know how gentle this is once again
really lightweight formula feels
feather-light on my skin hope you're
thinking quite quickly well and this is
actually 99% natural ingredients and of
course it's against animal testing and
it's all respectful material so I really
want from Burt's Bees and big fan of the
brand so looking forward to having this
in my daily routine so while my
moisturizer sinks in I'll just briefly
let you know about a new flavor of the
little x and polish which as you guys
know
an absolute favorite of mine I spoke
about in a very recent skincare routine
video which I will leave link down below
it's my current skincare routine evening
and morning but there is now a
grapefruit and patchouli fragrance which
I believe is going to the limited
edition as you can imagine it smells
absolutely heavenly so if like me you
are a kind push fan then it's really
lovely to try a new fragrance I'm sure
you guys'll love it as much as I do
really nice packaging as well very fresh
and floral so next we're going to prime
my skin this is the Laura Mercier
foundation primer which is the radiant
version this also came in my harris gift
with purchase so not only am I getting
to try new things but also getting some
travel sizes of things that I already
know and love so this one is slightly
tinted a little bit pale for me if I'm
definitely going to need foundation on
top so if you having a really good skin
thing and potentially you could just use
this and then smooth some brows and
mascara and you'd be done and now I'm
going to apply some foundation this is a
really exciting new launch from the new
collection from Marc Jacobs Beauty this
is their full coverage foundation and as
she promises oh my goodness look how
cool that is looking you have to twist
it they're going to be a pipette yes
well a little bit gloopy I think you've
got to shake that and so this is part of
a quite big new collection I was also
very kindly sent a massive bronzer a
bronzing brush and also a coconut primer
but I'm just going to try this one for
today so giving that a good shake but
that consistency feels really lovely and
then just dotting that my face feels
very light considering it's going to be
a full coverage foundation so we'll see
and now I'm going to blend it in with a
new Beauty Blender this is from their
summer neon collection you can also get
like a neon green and a neon yellow okay
I can already see that this is full
coverage it really is and pretty good
color match for me it probably looks a
little bit dark in the camera but this
is the color that I want my face to be
this is the color that
and I have got a massive spot there I'm
sure you guys already noticed and this
is completely covered it so if you're
having a bad skin day then this is
potentially a very good one to try I've
got to say I am very impressed with this
consistency and formula there goes the
tongue yeah it has given the most
amazing full coverage but I don't feel
cakey I think potentially if you have
dry skin you're going to want to put on
really hydrating moisturizer before this
but my skin is quite mad at the moment
and you know sometimes when you've got
bad skin and no foundation will ever
look good but I feel like this has given
my skin I could catch a lot of its
radiance but has also covered my slops
so that's fantastic I'm going to set
this down with some translucent powder
I'm not sure if it needs it because it
does promise 24-hour but because it's
roasting outside I feel like I'm going
to need it this is the bye bye cause
translucent powder from it cosmetics
which is finally now available in stores
here in the UK you can get it from
Selfridges and this is the product that
I have tried before and really really
liked it comes a little pervy a what you
call it I just quit cause it's a really
lightweight powder developed with
dermatologists really good to skin it
mineral based so it's not going to take
up your complexion but hopefully this
will just mattify and set the base I
could have applied an under-eye
brightening concealer as well but I
don't actually have any in my new in
selection so just going to leave the
under-eye area as it is I've also got
the it cosmetics and brow power I have
again used this before really really
liked it it's got a foodie on one end
and then the pencil in the other end so
it's a great little multitasker I find
that it lasts a long time it has good
color payoff sometimes when I use
roll-up brow things like this and
they're a little bit waxy like this one
is sometimes the color still retake to
my skin whereas this one really does I'm
trying not to make my brows to don't go
because as you can see my hair is rather
bright so just trying
keep it fairly natural using really
light strokes so I'm giving a brows
really natural and you guys know I like
to keep most my makeup fairly natural
looking and so next I'm going to use
some of the powders within the new
Charlotte Tilbury instant looking a
pallet five-minute face on the go so
these are slightly different colors to
the previous palette which I absolutely
adore really good for taking traveling
with you it's just so nifty you've got
all these very usable shades cheek I'm
get some hot cocoa contour face bronzing
highlighting blusher and then three eye
shades if you guys know my usual makeup
style you'll know that these are very
much my shade so it means you can just
take the one palette with you it's what
was ginormous mirror in the lid as well
so actually much better than the mirror
I was just using I'm going to apply a
couple of these eye shadows but do you
have another palette that I want to
share with you as well we're going to
take the light one and take that
actually all the way up to the brow bone
use it almost as a brow highlighter I
can tell already I'm gonna get so much
use out of this palette in the summer so
this one is actually out already
combined so now links to everything
otherwise will be found in the
description box to other palettes I've
been loving recently are both from a
zoeva I went to a breakfast the other
day with so in herself and absolutely
amazing to meet her I've always been a
fan of to leave the palette so either
brochures as you guys know so two
palettes I really love at the moment
first one is this rose golden one these
are a lot warmer tones a little bit all
tumbler you could definitely wear these
from like the height of summer to autumn
but goals you've got kind of terracotta
and these are almost havoc and then this
palette I actually haven't used yet is
the basic moment I shadow palette these
are a mixture of matte and metallic and
just pretty much if you love basic
eyeshadows like I do then this is your
dream palette you got from great like a
taupe color to a beige just absolutely
beautiful colors I'm you know I'm going
to get a lot a lot of use out of I think
I'm going to apply this one new era I
know I'm not pushing the boat out at all
but I'm not a makeup artist I know
I like so that's what we're going to go
for it's going to put this all over the
lid as a base color using my very very
golden brush of course another eye
product I'm really intrigued by is this
one it's from Bobby Brown and it's
called and I love now I have always kind
of wondered how models sometimes get
that like blonde effect on their eyes
I've never heard of an eye boss before I
don't think I can apply this now because
I have put a powder on already but this
color is absolutely beautiful the
gorgeous pink shade so I'm definitely
going to give this a try keep my my
Instagram stories for first impressions
of this because it could be a really
cool look amazing so far but what I'm
going to apply next is mascara I've got
a brand new one from Maybelline this
literally arrived in the cosec morning
this is the colossal Big Shot for volume
express mascara and this kind of makes
me last because I think brands are
running out of big words like colossal
big shots even scars are always like
volume exaggerate you know they're
always just big words but almost guys
that different with someone girls be
like oh you're wearing course or big
shot I don't know but let's see how this
one works
it's this gorgeous like bright yellow we
gold packaging it kind of reminds me of
Ibiza and very you know bloody and the
bristles on the brush look really good
so I'm optimistic about this one let's
see if I can get some big colossal
lashes I've not curled my lashes
normally a sign of a really good mascara
if it can make my lashes look good
without using a color okay I have to say
so far I am impressed my lashes seem to
be separating room nicely it's an
intense black shade added a little bit
of length but a significant amount of
volume after a few coats that's looking
really good so first impressions
pretty darn good especially as I said
without lash curlers so I've applied two
coats now if you'd go a teeny bit clumpy
on this side but maybe I didn't leave it
long enough for the first coat to dry
and but I'm really impressed I think if
you are blessed with naturally good
lashes then this is going to be
absolutely incredible for you they are
pretty big pretty colossal they do
a little bit kind of short leash and
considering false lashes and considering
I don't have any eyeliner on I'm really
impressed with how it made my eyes look
a lot wider a lot brighter
so yeah I'm sorry I kind of mock slips
written with but I'm actually very
impressed
so then apply some bronzer next and you
guys know how much I love the hourglass
ambient light bronzer well I'm pleased
to reveal that it now comes in two new
shades so if you saw it that you'd or if
you fallen in love with it as much as
possible then think again because this
by the looks fit is a little bit more
ashy a little bit more natural if you
found the old one a bit orange
personally I loved it wouldn't have a
negative thing to say about it but I'm
intrigued to try this one also so nice
having a new one because as you know
I've been using my previous ones for the
past two years maybe year and a half and
it's very battered it's only just hit
pan so this feels heavenly trying new
one I think from my skin's it's more
ashy shade would be a really really
lovely change for me doesn't seem to be
having quite as much color payoff as the
old one but maybe that's a good thing
because I don't want to look like an
oompa loompa this one is called nude
bronze light so really good if you do
want a more natural finish for your
bronzer I think that this will be one
that I reach for in every day basis
really liking how it looks so far I just
use it to give my face a little bit of
definition a little bit of color and I
think if you're a blonde then this is
potentially a really good shape for you
so I'm so happy to have a new ambient
light bronzer in my collection and then
I'm reaching for this bronze goddess
summer look palette this is from Estee
Lauder their bronze goddess summer 2017
collection and this is kind of along the
same lines as the Charlotte Tilbury
palette I showed you earlier lots of
very usable products in walnut palette
and moving big mirror and the lid
beautiful packaging I'm going to try
this blusher quite um powdery but I
think it's going to be a gorgeous shade
oh my god it's so pretty I'm just using
a sigma 0-5 of power
rush I actually underestimated how
strong this colored going to be but this
is my first time using it and that is a
gorgeous color I hope this coming up
live on camera because that is a
beautiful blush HD for support to
eyeshadow shades and then this kind of
aquamarine really bright vivid turquoise
which runs through the collection also
on the lid of the new Franz kotas Chimel
oil which I just adore I'm still using
up my one from last year but the lush
wise I think that could be a new
favorite or times of shimmer I really
like this this could be yeah definitely
a new favorite blush and then we have
some new highlight colleges and I think
some of these are highlights and blushes
from see a that came in a really lovely
love log of mail sent out I haven't
actually thought taken them out of the
packaging yet but individually they are
marbled a little bit like hourglass I'm
actually going to pop a little bit of
this on top of what I already have on my
cheek see if it well that is pretty
implant very good color payoff in fact a
little bit too much and they do have a
bit of shimmer in them so really love
you highlight blush this is probably one
of the darkest it's more of a perfect
shade this one called baby doll really
love the packaging you've got these
little stars you got a mirror and lid
very luxurious packaging and five new
shades of the horizon brushes I think
easily a big hit this summer so next I'm
going to apply my signature and matte
lip this is a new one to me is the meet
match use long lasting liquid lipstick
from the balm cosmetics we all know mary
lou manizer but i'm yet to try any other
products from them so let's give this a
go apologies to any regular viewers i'm
really not putting a boat out here but
you know this is the look that I love so
color wise this is really nice mmm it
smells like after eights you know the
chocolate sinking my mouth water and its
kind of tingly as well
color wise it's a little bit darker than
what I would normally go for it this
time of year but I really like how that
feels on my lips really creamy and yet
very nice kind of natural everyday and
I hope it is long-lasting because this
is the kind of color that I do want my
lips to be kind of all day every day
when I ask meetings things like that so
hopefully it does last a long time so I
think that the last makeup product I
wanted to apply what I'm going to do is
finish with a very beautiful New York
from which they go so this is what a
blogger Mellon looks like and then
inside I have seven illuminating powders
and these are just moved beautiful
powders I think I've ever seen these are
is a very humid addition I feel very
lucky to have them and they are almost
like fabric boxes they look like
engagement ring boxes not going to lie
so I think that's probably just press
edition I'm not usual but the main ones
will come in this little compact you've
got the brush in here and then the
powder underneath so this is a
combination of these powders let me show
you what they look like so individual
little boxes drop to live and the loose
powders inside I'm going to take my
brush and swirl it across all of them
just on the brush would be good for this
so as it's illuminating I'm just going
to pop it on at the cheekbones you could
choose an individual powder for color
correcting but for me I think it's just
a wash across all of them is really
beautiful mmm that is so pretty
hopefully the camera is picking that up
but it's just a very subtle very
feminine below I would say I do also
really want to try this it's the new
chubby plump and shine and liquid lip
plumping gloss from Clinique I'm not
sure I should put it over the top of
matte lipstick those I'm going to leave
it for now but once again keep my -
cancer risk so I will be China out very
soon probably tomorrow morning I wanted
to also mention a new launch that I've
been loving this month these are from
Sally Hansen it's the new color therapy
range family to the Argonauts they're
very nourishing for air conditioning
females I love the color range I've
picked up this one and it's also a pink
one on so for just too far fighters need
to reach it but I'll put an overlay clip
here so yeah because they've got argan
oil I've been using these between gel
manicures so I would love to have
shellac on my nails
it's just very long-lasting I don't need
to worry about it but of course your
nails didn't need a break sometimes and
it's nice to really nourish them this is
a cuticle oil and there's also a
nourishing base coat and top coat
in fact works as well I think this is
the base coat and this color I got so
many questions when I wore there's a
couple of weeks ago this is the shade
200 powder room which is the most
beautiful powder pink pearly metallic
color so gorgeous and also when my
shellac is coming towards the end of its
life it's getting a little bit chips I'm
just doing putting layers of this over
the top I don't really get the
nourishing benefits it's very opaque
colors so it really does give an ounce
just beautiful color has been a big big
fan of this I know my mom is - should
keep pinching them from me really loving
you now launch range from something
handsome there's a new range of lashes
out from I'm you all this is that
enchanted range you guys know how much I
love either lashes these ones camellia I
think is going to be really popular they
are half lashes they really go to just
popping on the tips if you want
something a little bit more subtle I
also really like Lily I think I'm going
to wear these next time I have an
evening out or maybe some bad quality
Monday I'm going out and friends in your
wedding then but yeah beautiful new
collection from I deal a couple of hair
products I'm really excited to try this
is from a vader is the primer on a range
it's a basically purifying care for your
scalp so a lot of us don't really
realize that when we have hair problems
is actually originating from problems
with the scalp instead of with our
actual hair particles on my goodness
Dickinson just rolled on his back and be
snoring and is so cute I don't if I can
control myself I need to go and kiss him
but yeah this you put directly onto your
scalp you can also get a kind of
massaging Harris to go with it that
really just massages it further into
your belt and it really cleanses the
skin on your hair as well as exfoliating
so if you do have any dandruff or dry
skin and genuinely just want to get rid
of product build up then this sounds
like a really good product for that very
excited to try it back out and another
new launch which I'm excited to try is
the fusion range from Weller this is
specifically designed for repairing your
hair and intense repair shampoo and
conditioner but mainly very
shallow I love it because it's rude
girls packaging Thank You Ella I'm
excited to give deep a try I'll keep you
guys updated on how they works my hand
for the night time I have a new sleeping
mask or night cream from deklay oh it's
part of their Hydra floral range which
I've spoken about before on this channel
I love the fragrance it just takes me
back to the spas and pampering so very
much looking forward to this is the skin
perfecting hydrating sleeping mask and
one of the ingredients is neroli which
is one of my all-time favorite
fragrances I always think it smells so
high-end and I'm curious
probably because of Tom Ford it's the
perfect thing for the skin overnight so
looking forward giving this a try that's
out now available some Harris I do
believe and a few others love to things
this is a new launch from Ferrero so
previously I've only tried their
cleansing a difficult cleansing brush a
little vibrating strange item but this
is a blue light acne treatment they
kindly sent me the pink one and and
finally blue light has gets the meet the
surface of the skin and helps to root
out any causes of acne so I'm probably
going to try on my blemishes which are
now folks we covered from Marc Jacobs
foundation it says rapidly and gently
clear acne blemishes helps prevent
future breakouts I get breakout on my
job so much I'm going to give this try
on that area it sounds like a really
good way of treating the skin at home so
I'm definitely going to give this a
thorough test out but I just want to
draw your attention through it in
today's video and finally I wanted to
mention the new trade routes and fixture
and Ralf Viktor and Rolf is probably my
favorite fragrance house because Klaus
von is my favorite fragrance of all time
it just brings back so many memories I
feel like it was my fragrance Ince
cooling of anyone's smells there's like
always juicy perfume and I still wear it
every single time I have a special
occasion
loved it so it's very excited to try out
their new fragrances they come
beautifully presented this is available
in Harris exclusively for a little while
and then it's going to be available
elsewhere beautiful packaging and an in
and maybe our guest this is a lot more
nutrients a lot more expensive than
Flowerbomb so I have gone for sparkling
secret there are a few more in the range
all of them do smells very high-end very
luxurious this one I would say it's
quite delightful it feels very fresh
it's very much the kind of thing that I
want to well and days like today oh it's
really warm but I still oh my goodness
want to smell amazing at the same time
is very warming I feel like there might
be some woody notes in this but this I
sprayed this when I went to the fabulous
dinner that they had and I was getting
compliment on how I smell for days
afterwards so I can guarantee the amount
I just sprayed is actually way too much
it's a very strong fragrance so while it
may be a little bit more on the pricey
side you're definitely going to get a
lot of fragrance which is one spritz so
potentially want to really put on your
wish list for those special occasions
it's nothing like Flowerbomb it's really
lot more mature it smells a lot more
luxurious it smells like a designer
perfume not that flour-bombed of them
but they're just smells totally
different and I love it in different
ways how I know flower bon but yeah I
think that are we getting some more
compliments on this it smells the whole
room now smells absolutely gorgeous so
yeah very excited to add this to my
fragrance wardrobe and there's
definitely gonna be one I'll be reaching
for on special occasions okay so that is
everything that I want to chat you about
