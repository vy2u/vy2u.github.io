special
smoking outside trying to get your
attention you make me
I'm into the scullery for luncheon this
is the Mian you it's a Louisville high
energy salad mix cream bowl chicken
salad
nori rolls and juices let's go check out
this room so cute
here comes I'll take one of everything

nutritious luncheon and we are now going
to be doing a little yoga out here in
the sunshine so beautiful the ground
skiing and lighting free of craters it's
all the yoga then we've got towels

smoothies
get in my belly this is what really
happens on the lager trips are you
working on em editing have photos laptop
out in the dappled shade of the tree
this is what bloggers life is really
like
that's not a bad place to do it
I know you want the best for me the way
his classes of the day are done I'm
feeling absolutely exhausted following
hard boxing class just had a quick
freshen up and now we're going to take
some outfit photos this whole place is
so stunning we're all eager to capture
as much content as possible especially a
bit of a behind-the-scenes of a bloody
photo shoot if anyone ever wondered how
Jess gets her Instagram shots this is it
hi darlings it is now the next day it is
Tuesday and we got back last night at
around 8 p.m. it was a long day but a
really really fun day desperate to go
back to lime wood I was editing my
photos this morning and they look so
pretty and I have to give a shout out to
myself for the presets because they make
the photos look even better I know you
probably asks you've always been going
on about them but they are available now
in the free Lightroom app I will show
you on the screen here how it works so I
just imported my photos straight from my
camera into the Lightroom app and yes
you can now buy them all or individually
for the mobile so you don't need to pay
for Lightroom subscription so when the
photos are in the app I just copy and
paste the settings over to my pictures
from the presets and it makes them look
so amazing so this picture from the
front of the house was kind of boring
kind of green and then with the valencia
preset just looked so so beautiful and
also this one in the greenhouse again i
wouldn't normally have posted this
because it's too green and too orangey
but then with the amalfi preset looked
absolutely stunning so those are just a
couple examples and then the rosebush
one this one just looked so so nice
looked beautiful even before the preset
but afterwards as i think you'll agree
just looks divine
if I do say so myself so a little cheeky
plug from me I will leave the
information about the presets down below
if you want to update your Instagram
editing game anyway enough about that
today's outfit which is what you're
really here for I'm wearing surprise
surprise my Kate Spade dress which I'm
in love
I cannot stop wearing it but if you find
something that you love then make the
most of it so I'm wearing the dress the
beautiful dress I'm wearing my little
pearl heels
these are dupes of these short white
sand ones I also have the Stuart
Weitzman real versions but I actually
prefer the dupes
I'll leave these link down below and
then I've gone for my little at wire
cell I think this is called a wallet on
a chain and I haven't used this in such
a long time but I thought because I'm at
a few events it'd be nice to leave my
big bag this one here in the cloakroom
I always carry two bags with me and then
I can just put my phone and my money in
this one so I don't have to care
anything around with me so that's what
I'm wearing today first stop is lunch
I'm going to Balthazar to meet Rhys for
lunch and then I have a lovely event
with rewards style at page from
nurseries in comic garden then I have
another meeting and then an event with a
Victoria's Secret so that'll be fun
I'll catch up with you when I'm probably
let's go
so reality check suddenly this is not
actually ready cells routing the
illusion wants it to be notice me this
is not too much like you know we
wouldn't mind dating someone who owned
this but but it's incredible but tonight
it is penthouse victorious the
Victoria's Secret have taken over this
and saying apartment and we're looking
at to all their lovely new lingerie
there's some PJs let me show you some of
the PJs
it's all just very cute and girly look
at this
Oh cute I feel like I've been my
mother's little dress on a cube and am I
gonna show you my favorite little
lingerie set this one here it's a cute
little sparkling bong and padded bra za
which I love cute this is a very pretty
oh my goodness
except when when Visa belt people about
see you
[Laughter]
it's
you gotta smile make the Sun Rise
make it shine but I can see that you
don't
good morning darlings
it is now Wednesday last night was so
much fun at the Victoria penthouse it
was basically this penthouse apartment
which is for sale I dread to think how
much for overlooking all of East London
we could see the London Eye we could see
the shard it was amazing
got to see some of the Victoria Secret
new collections I've never spoken to
their PR or done anything with them
before so that was really nice today I
was meant to have a load of meetings
however woke up this morning and
realized that we have a guy coming over
today to do our floors so we had a leak
a little while ago so we have the
Builder over to buff our floors and so
I've just driven the dogs to mum's house
because they would have been very very
stressed
I made the whole building work going on
you may notice that the interior of the
car looks a little bit different I was
really worried that we were going to be
losing our beloved master but they very
kindly have swapped it over for us so we
still have a cx-5 we have white
interiors now as you can see which is
totally dreamy and this one isn't
automatic this was my first journey ever
driving an automatic took a little bit
of getting used to but now it's so nice
you don't have to like think about
changing gear obviously so in London
traffic it's absolutely perfect and it's
got all the technology that our old
Mazda had so I love it again nearly back
home now Charlie and I are going to go
and grab a brunch together and then I've
got loads of work to do lots of videos
that need editing
then I'm going to get my nails done I
took my nail varnish off last night so
they're a little bit nude at the moment
so I'm gonna head to you guessed it
London grace for that I'm just trying to
support my camera because I've got it on
like a stud thing but I think it's a
little bit wobbly so I'm gonna invest in
a new car holder anyway I will catch up
with you probably at brunch so see you
later on toast two poached eggs and
Teresa and I'll be having your eggs as
well my pirate scum Dexter Gorbachev see
we should have them with me actually
they're Lincoln garlock's things please
excuse the mess going on behind me but I
thought while we have a few moments of
quiet in the house because the builders
are buffing the floor downstairs they'll
probably start up again in a second and
it's very loud but I thought I'd quickly
run through a few bloggers mail bits
before I go and get my nails done that
because I don't want to have to rummage
through lots of parcels when I get back
and I have perfect nails so I'm going to
show you some of my favorite things that
we just picked up from
doddle the first of which I've already
opened and oh my goodness this is from
so don't if you remember last vlog so
can i went into liberty I saw these
sausage dog themed pieces in the store
and I absolutely fell in love and the
very very kind girls there have sent
them over this is an Emma fridge water
mug with lots of little Dexter's all
around it it says dachshund on the
inside and then I think this is actually
I can egg a cup but it looks like my
deck see it is so so cute so thank you
so much to the girls at Liberty but that
is not all they sent
and there's something else in my pile
but it's actually at the bottom of the
pile so I'll show you the second Liberty
thing in a second I also have a delivery
and this is literally the most useful
thing anyone could ever send a blogger
it's actually from CYO which is color
like cosmetics available from boots
they've got some really crazy cool
bright things perfect festivals or
parties but also some more tame things
as well like mascaras this is a contour
stick oh and I've heard that this is a
really good tube of the Tom Ford
illuminating cream this is a lumen ating
mixing cream it says called turn on the
light really affordable from boots so
I'll let you know how I get along with
those and they very kindly he also sent
a skinny dip mobile phone charging block
which is amazing because my one is
coming to the end of its life it only
kind of gives you about 30% more so
that's amazing thank you very much to
CYO cosmetics I had a delivery from dr.
sever and they are a skincare brand that
I've always loved they have
really good Multi multi function
products some of their creams are really
great for anti-pollution and anti blue
light so the light that effects your
skin from screens laptops etc lots of
their products actually help your skin
to protect itself from that this is a
new point from them it's a gradual
self-tanning drops so you can add these
to your moisturizer your face cream it
says also has the digital HEV light
protection in there so lots of benefits
to that I'm going to start using that
right away so that's gonna go in the
drawer next to my moisturizer so I don't
forget to use that something else which
has multi benefits is this new launch
from cover FX this is a makeup setting
spray but it's also anti pollution which
is really really important if you live
in the city a lot of brands are getting
on this whole anti-pollution bandwagon
which is amazing because if you live or
work in the city you'll know how much it
affects your skin this is a makeup
setting spray that also protects against
pollution from cover FX and that is a
really fine a mist as well that again
it's gonna go straight in my draw a
delivery from a moravec service is their
complexion Perfector in SPF of 20 so I
think this is going to be like a BB
cream obviously and more of ik so their
skin care products are absolutely
heavenly so this is very exciting move
in some more makeup kind of products
it's got a little pump I have got a bit
of makeup on already today but does go
and apparently this also has the amore
of exert patented healing concentrate to
deliver all the potent minerals
occurring naturally in the amore vyx of
healing waters deep into the epidermis
of the skin silicon free tinted
moisturizer that blends effortlessly
into the skin for glowing at flawless
complexion zinc oxide provides a natural
SPF 20 from UVA and UVB rays oh and
that's a real I mean I did have a little
bit of BB cream on earlier um but that
finish is so nice really glowy and fresh
perfect for summer perfect for popping
in the gym bag
better very nice another skincare
blogger Mel this is from da fan so they
always send these beautiful boxes and
inside this beautiful little pouch it
says introducing their pedal infused lip
oils with nutrient rich botanical oils
to plump condition and protect from
dryness ooh let's have a little look
what a gorgeous little pouch and it's so
cute oh wow oh my goodness
so dolphin obviously unknown for their
oils for their skin care I love to use
them in the evenings and there they've
got the oil in cleansers things like
that so now they have oil infused lip
balms look how beautiful can you see
that so they actually do have petals
inside these lip aisles I've actually
got a lip balm on at the moment and I
try those later and let you know because
they are spectacular
Darvin have partnered with luxury French
designer Maison Baloo Shan to create
this beauty handcrafted makeup pouch oh
that is adorable
miss Eva put stuff on oh so this was a
really cute little blogger mail this is
from Birchbox they've sent a couple of
bits and pieces I'm so pleased that this
didn't break in the post normally
anything like this arrives smashed it is
a little teacup with this beautiful blue
detail at the bottom and also Birchbox
is five napkin and little cookie and
this as you might guess is to celebrate
but box turning five years old which is
amazing I always kind of think of birch
boxes I don't know being around forever
can't imagine life without birch box but
they've also included this cute little
cake tin and inside are some of the
favorite you can get in birch box
products including a wizard Chelsey
collection of tea especially for their
fifth birthday and some products you can
buy on the Birchbox website so the Pearl
primer from benefits there's a smoothing
balm from n4 and a glam glow super
cleanse so lovely little selection of
products to celebrate Birchbox birthday
day Birchbox I have some new lip duo
sculpting pencils from Bourjois and
lovely exciting in your high street
launch let's have a look this one is the
shade peach shake and when you open them
up you can see twister at the bottom
it's actually two different colors and
if you can see that you've got a darker
shade at the bottom and a lighter shade
so when you use these the darker shade
will be acting like a liner and will
work to contour the lips these are going
to be $7.99 on counter this month and
there are six different shades which I
have all of here but I think that peachy
one is probably going to be my favorite
I got this lovely little package with
some meringue girls meringues and also a
new hydrating lip balm from fresh fresh
always have the loveliest of lip balms I
have one on my bedside table this looks
like it'll be a really nice color for
summer it's a lovely soft peachy shade

beautiful and that's got a very lovely
soft peach smell very very nice thank

tan from their of their vain range that
birds twittering away in the background

amazing after a workout really cooling
on the body and this is their new
exfoliating sugars and the venn algún i
think it's a an exfoliating paste you
you know one of those really lovely like
body butters that's got the sugar
particles in there so it very gently
exfoliates you oh yes look at that oh my
goodness this is so good for free fake
tanning and pampering and smells
absolutely incredible so I look forward
to trying that out thank you lots of ton
something a little bit more practical I
have been sent the new Shore maximum
protection antiperspirant deodorant
these are really good for traveling
because they're not liquid and I think
this is yeah this is four to five mils
so if you're going hand luggage only
it's um perfect for that and doesn't
take up much room in your suitcase and
it does the job so that's gonna come
with me for my next couple of days also
that really
keep in your handbag I have something
very exciting here from la Mer this is
their blue heart edition moisturizing
cream so this is wow this is a limited
edition oh my goodness and this is to
celebrate all of the good work that la
Mer do for protecting the oceans this
month is there's a lot of awareness
around all the amounts of plastic in the
ocean and with the history of lemare and
how the ingredients that it uses
obviously that's something that they're
very passionate about so some of the
profits from this will go towards those
charities and it is just the most
fantastic special edition of the classic
moisturizing cream which I'm a huge huge
fan of this is definitely the kind of
product that you don't want a hydrate in
your dressing table and it's going to
live right on the top there I've also
been sent a top-up of my favorite blonde
shampoo and conditioner this is the red
candle on dish that is what I use to get
the ashy tone to my blonde hair gets rid
of any yellowness and it doesn't dry out
the hair like a lot of toning products

almost grey there is nothing better than
this highly highly recommend I'll leave
this exact one link down below because I
now could not live without this a lovely
little blogger Mel from benefit it says
hello happy and it's for their soft blur
foundation inside there's a really cute
little like a washing line with some
cute pictures sadly a couple of the pegs
are broken as they've fallen off now but
they've put this little picture in which
is from our recent trip to learn they've
popped the picture of me in bed with my
two little boys and then this one that
still pegged is Charlie and I in the
Maldives after our engagement which is
so cute and they've also in the Box
popped in the new foundation soft blue
foundation SPF 15 shared medium coverage
oh la la so it looks like this
that's the packaging very very snazzy
it's quite small as well so I'd be
really good one for in the handbag

think this one may be a little bit light
