guide to London today I'm going to be
taking you around from my favorite
photogenic spots in the city from cafes
to galleries the flower store I'm going
to also write the corresponding blog
post on fashion manga calm with even
more tips for visiting the city so I'll
leave a link to that down in the
description box below you'll also find
links to what I'm wearing because every
place that we visit I'm also going to
share with you one of my favorite
outfits at the moment so without further
ado the best place to start your
Instagram all day is here at farm girl
cafe make sure to grab one of the rose
petal markers and try and get here early
to get one of the very Instagram book in
space it's a favorite among of lifestyle
owners who will queue up from the early
hours just to get that all-important
photo
I'll see your healthy breakfast at
farmgirl cafe it's only a 5-minute walk
down the road to beautiful Westbourne
Grove where you'll find Nicky Tibbles
wild at heart this is by far the most
instagrammed flower store in London and
it's no surprise why look how beautiful
is the next declination is about a minor
way so it hopped into a black cab get us
out there I find black cabs are the
easiest way to get around London but you
can always use apps such as 50 mother to
find out the best way again
sometimes no matter how prepared you are
you always have to deal with some
building work this is London after all
14 Chavez square is one of the most
beautiful and photographed houses in
London but never mind let's head on to
the next location
a short but very photogenic walk from 14
Travis Square is the infamous Kings Road
which is well we're heading for our next
focus on your way make sure to go buy a
Harris those all-important London
touristy photos we have made it to
Chelsea and just behind the do periodic
square is the starchy gallery if you've
been on my blog or You Tube channel
before you may recognize these columns
because I like to take a lot of my
outfit photos here the perfect place to
get that all-important outfit shot via
Instagram
just a short journey away from Chelsea
is Peggy Portia and it's another very
Instagram herbal Cafe and Bakery
complete with the most beautiful
cupcakes in the whole of London the
staff here also really really friendly
and very accommodating to those of us
who just want to nail that perfect
we reached our final destination which
is some of that house you're technically
not allowed to take photos inside the
house I just love coming here taking you
sneaky photos outside and also visiting
different restaurants it's one of the
most photogenic restaurants in the fold
of London
these include beautiful bright interiors
and you have to go to the bathroom it is
absolutely gorgeous
so that's it's my Instagram guide for
them then I really hope you guys enjoyed
