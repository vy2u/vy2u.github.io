parrots vlog so I really hope you guys
enjoyed my water war in Paris that I
published a few weeks ago I'll leave
that one links down below because that
one really is a kind of touristy few
days in Paris and when I war so today
I'm back and I'm here with a few boys
I'm here would Carl there he is
and Charlie in the background taking
some photos and we were here last night
as guests of Paco Rabanne went to a
fabulous event and we stayed at the
beautiful limo each hotel today we are
pretty much being tourists but with
Instagram on our agenda it's like the
Spurs days blog because you've already
seen me wandering around Paris in this
night outfit I thought I would do an
Instagram as guide to Paris because last
time I feel like I picked up a few
really good places and today the two
boys look at them they're there with
their cameras for all our curtains with
us and we're trying to create some
really nice content I thought I would
make this vlog yeah an Instagram guys
Paris so at the moment were in the
jardin des tuileries I'm gonna say right
now apologies for any bad or wrong
pronunciation because I haven't learnt
French since I was about 12 years old so
quite a long time ago so yeah we're in
the jardin des tuileries and here is a
really fabulous place to photos you can
get such fabulous depth of field because
you have all of these gorgeous long
avenues despite the fact that it a
weekend it's still fairly quiet here
we're super lucky with the weather today
the lighting is perfect for photos so
let's get nothing
you
you
so depending on your Instagram grid
where we are now the plus dinner Concord
could be a really good option
Karl behind me his grid is very neutral
seems he likes a lot of beige and white
colors so he's going to get some shots
with his beautiful building behind me of
his background also the huge open space
so on scanning it turns depth of field
if that is your style so let's see what
photos
come on to get here at the plastic
concord obviously this is also very
touristy place so I was just coming here
super early in the morning it's about 11
o'clock now and also traffic you need to
make sure you climb it right with the
traffic lights but yeah early in the
morning is usually the best bet nice and
wise and busyness wise try and get that
shot charlie is using human path and 75
mil pen
- you call it was all the way over that
we'll be getting some really good depth
of field
we have confusing for sabe and EpiPen
aid both of which are really beautiful
artist actually so if you really like
columns and stands it's definitely a
great place to come Carl behind me is
doing the same exact only it's really
nice neutral background you're not
seeing that much of Paris here but it's
such an iconic building so nice to get a
couple of shots here as well
another place in Paris which is just
pure Instagram goals is here which is
the peninsula hotel I just met up with
the girls for afternoon tea as you saw a
few clips of and every single room we
keep exploring every single room here is
gusta Gramlich goals behind me is the
reception area the lobby let me show you
this
good morning it's our second day in
Paris and straight back onto the
Instagram mission today we have woken up
in a new apartment we were so so lucky
to find this place it is I believe the
apartments name is Chamberlain and but
if that's wrong I'll leave the
information below and we are staying
here as guests of Paris perfect rentals
and this could not be a more Instagram
apartment so that perfect Parisian
picture for me has to take three boxes
I saw Power View balcony and coffee
macaroons okay maybe that's all boxes
but this is exactly what we have here so
to look behind me disease in this
apartment is directly out onto the
Eiffel Tower let's go and have a look
the location wise this apartment is
pretty much in the middle of Paris and
what more could we ask for
it's very small but for Parisian
standards I really don't think it's too
bad at all it's very luxurious inside
you've got a real nice sorrow on board
middle color from the rules really nice
kind of French old shabby chic style
furniture excuse our stuff everywhere
but it's really beautifully done up I
think if I had a Parisian apartment it
would look something like this there's a
really lovely dining table this bed here
is a sofa bed so culture up there last
night and then we've got a kitchen area
and they very kindly brought us some
bits and bobs to get us started some
milk orange juice wine all the
essentials through here is the bedroom
where Charlie and I slept all surface
very beautiful and photogenic see behind
me and then this side got these sliding
doors which open out into our bathroom
my Karl is busy instagramming and
getting some shots areas and as you can
see once again you can be lying in the
bathtub overlooking the Eiffel Tower so
we definitely struck it lucky when it
came to our apartment sadly it is
raining this morning every bloggers
nightmare hard to get good photos in the
rain but I'm going to try my hardest now
to get that perfect balcony shot the
boys got there yesterday while I was at
the afternoon tea which I'm really on
now about dark by the time I got here
that yeah going to try and get that shot
and I'm going to show you how I'm going
to edit it so that hopefully doesn't
look like it's great and miserable
outside also marble sink I feel like if
you're a blogger or if you're
aesthetically obsessed like I am then
you'll appreciate this model thinking
and a shambling bathroom because we're
in Paris so why not
okay so this is what's going on behind
the scenes of my Paris
balcony eiffel tower shot I've got a
circuiting wet balcony using a towel and
in the settlement owl and then we've got
lighting a sixth ring got my little
ladder a bag and I put the flowers from
the mantelpiece
on the
chair the boys are ready to get laughing
challenge the Rollo yeah we're all in
our white rule next today look at us we
look like $3 insane assignment I've been
being able 3 snowballs so Carl's going
to try and take the photo on an Olympus
om-d and how he's going to take it on my
phone and because I'm not too sure about
the lighting so let's see how I go
so I think we might have got the shot I
think it's probably one of the phone
shots and that I was getting severely
dripped on so the shoot was cut short
suddenly now we're checking out our
apartment has not been not been long
enough hopefully next time we'll come
for a little bit longer and our next
stop of the day where I'm going to sit
some photos is the Angelina cafe which
yes this is a blog a cliche but I've
never been before that neither were the
boys
so we're going to go and check out
okay so in Angelina's members everything
my photos
so what I've done already is I've gone
through my camera roll and I put a
little heart
so I favorited the ones that I like and
then next I'm going in to vsco cam the
FBO cam and I'm adding in a few of them
I've got my favorite folder sees the
ones I like and I've taken one of them
and then what I normally do is I add a
filter and I personally really like the
m5 filter take it down a little bit and
then also increase the brightness just a
tad
once that's done I'm going to go into a
tune this is one I'm currently working
on so as you probably saw there's a
obvious sign in the background obviously
I don't want so I'm using the patch tool
or slowly but surely get rid of it let
me show you I do take the patch tool and
then you grab a bit of the photo that
you want to move if I'm taking this bit
here and patching it over the top about
that it's not completely perfect
if you a trained eye you'd definitely be
able to spot it but for me it's much
better than having the fine in the way
then I take the details tool and I'm
just going to paint over the roses to
make them stand out a bit more from the
major race line and a little bit on my
hair as well
okay all right so now that I've saved it
mask that if you go in on them is the
app on crowning using to turn my grid
vision and I'm going to import a photo
to see how it looks compared to the rest
of my photos
you
suddenly the weather is not on our side
days that we're not going to be getting
any of those picture-perfect shots but
we're trying our best so we've come to
the bridge with me visa London so that
you can't see because my brother's
getting in the way and the Eiffel Tower
is coming in and out of view with the
clouds all over the place
covering it up but yeah I think we've
got a few shots of the boys which I'll
show you on the screen now they can go
to you for a couple like reserved Rowley
now we're heading to the musee d'art may
I'm going to show you it basically but I
don't think we'll be able to get any
nicer okay today sadly I could get some
really gorgeous ones here and when I
came to Paris ten days ago so I'll show
you some of those and the lighting that
we got them really perfectly pretty nice
to get some DVD I can come back
six paces
we found that beautiful streets where
everybody comes to get that iconic
walking across the road shot with the
accent and background sadly as I said
earlier this weather is mean and we're
not going to get that shot but I will
put one on the screen now I think it was
by Julia angle and it was just most
beautiful shot ever and it is rude Mac
today I think it's called that's what
you want to come on a nice sunny day
goes an hour to get that perfect shot
one place you can not miss out when you
come to Paris is called another rain so
here we are in the boutique music room
Sun tunnel which is a really lovely
shopping street so why not pick up a
couple of macaroons perfect those coffee
flatmates later on it's one inside as
cafes and not that photogenic it's a
little bit dark but we're going to pick
them up take away and shoot them on the
go later this is the cafe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
