doing the journey because it's gonna be
amazing and arriving on little paradise

complexion it is rather warm it's about
32 degrees here today Charlie and I have

swimming costumes we've got the rest of
the afternoon it's just settling / have
a nap because did get too much sleep on
the last aeroplane so gonna have to back
it off a little bit of jet lag but it's
all worth it
now that we are in our favorite part of
paradise I'm just gonna finish this vlog
by showing you a view out of our room
and then I think I might film maybe one
other video just a few snippets while
we're here but you might have to wait a
little while for that one because I
don't think the Wi-Fi is very good but
anyway just to end this vlog take a look
at this view
