favorite scents this is time to enact
we need
feeling very relaxed and pampered after
our treatments I had a scalp massage and
a shoulder massage and she used a like a
muscle tension release bottom as well so
it's feeling nice and tingly how is your
facial just what we needed so we're just
pruning ourselves I've just done the her
don't want to look too scary because
we're just gonna head to Regent Street
now do a little bit of shopping I'm
gonna head to Michael caused a bit of
humbug perusing and then I think we're
gonna head to Selfridges
I won't you see just four to nine
apart Sookie
kay
okay so we're just perusing at the
Michael Kors store on Regent Street
mom's just having a look at the new
Blakely handbag which I think she's gone
another it
I would totally have I think I'm going
to rehearse one other stage she's been
looking for a new handbag pages and
keeps saying that she hasn't found the
perfect one hanukkah's her outfit was
quite lightweight as well but she's
warning though with the new bakery I'm
gonna treat her devout for Mother's Day
I'm just having a look at the rest of
the collection I've got obviously my
beautiful bag and it got some very
similar styles
they've got this fabulous decay area
waking treat your mama to another pair
flowers by grace move on over in the
other corners I'll show you that as well
but just beautiful simulant another gift
about curves layer straps folders things
for every budget little mother-daughter
shopping session that we were matching
so this little area behind me is where
they're preparing at the grace is born
bouquets you can get a little bit
with any purchase today so whether it's
menswear or small leather goods little
notebook a watch microphone watch any
purchase to get that budget I will see a
nice extra trick Mother's Day
so you just left Michael Kors and we are
now on our way to Selfridges we're going
to go to the Daniel Galvan salon and
half the cara staff treatment implode
dry but justly sorely needed yeah put a
little bit of oil we both got some oil
from the facials in our hand and we came

video I am three oh my goodness it's
gnarly spoiled today well it's nice and
lightweight and good color for your
wardrobe the latest model yes and also
they gave us each very kindly these
little they like the Michael Kors
Saffiano leather I think your Saffiano
leather is really lovely little notebook
handbag notebook we've got one each and
you get one for free if you book an
appointment before the 11th of March so
if you're thinking of going in for
Mother's Day
make an appointment whether you make a
purchase or not and you can have a nice
room notebook which is very very sweet
so yeah and by the hand
so we are now on route Selfridges next
stop where I come to the Daniel Garvin
salon in Selfridges and we're going to
get lovely Cara stars blow-dry the girls
are just had to look at my hair she's
seen them it's quite dry at the ends so
I'm going to get a fusee Oh Joseph wrote
a little bit of moisture back in math
and then building something next or and
that'll hopefully bring a bit of shine a
bit of nourishment to the ends of my
hair home let's get blow-dried this is
what we're going to be applying I've got
a couple of different few zero doses
this purple one
it's a radiance booster so she said that
because my hair is obviously blonde and
colored can like a little bit of
radiance but they should bring the shine
back and then this one is ready to help
boost the condition of the hair this is
the concentrate olio thews IAM nutri who
you think that means
mutual frying oil something like that
looks good
so the law has had her hair styled it's
very different to it she normally gets
so they've gone for a straight to do I
said to mom that she's not actually
changed a hair styling very I think it
suits you
it's very different let's see if the
volume stays they used a product
contented people you manatees you need
you have what you have it's not the
stranger I don't know she didn't
she's probably able you might've wanted
to find how many and shiny yeah very
good whereas I have gone for the Smurf
troll look today we're gonna I'm gonna
take it out and get some nice
my finished look very very voluminous
and it feels silky soft oh my gosh this
is my perfect perfect amount of curl so
hopefully the last
hey my eyes of you and I will do
anything I will do anything
back home again now as you can see I'm
very much in my dressing-gown and ready
to relax with the evening mum has
started her drive back home we're both
feeling wonderfully full and content
after afternoon to you with Galan so so
lovely to discover the new floral
fragrance which actually mum prefers the
401 and I think I slightly prefer the
original although I do absolutely love
floral fragrances so big fan I feel like
the whole of stares had a real kind of
floral spring theme to it from floral
applique on the bags to the floral notes
and the fragrances it's just been a
really really lovely kind of early
Mother's Day so I really hope you
enjoyed coming along with us and I hope
it's given you some ideas if you're
thinking of coming into London for the
day with your mama whether it's on
Mother's Day which hopefully this video
does go out on Friday as planned is a
couple of days away at least here in the
UK or even if you just want to come to
London with a family member or a friend
hopefully we've given you some ideas on
some lovely things you can do I realized
that we didn't really show other than
obviously the Connaught many food
options but I do have plenty of that
kind of information on my blog so I'll
leave some relevant posts down below but
I would say that normally mum and I like
to go to the restaurant on the roof at
Selfridges that's a really nice one
obviously there's the super Instagram of
all bakeries and cafe PEGI portion etc
and there's some really lovely healthy
places around Kings Road that we really
like to
and there's a police called wolf and
lamb which is actually a vegan
restaurant it's quite casual but that
would be a nice place if your mama is
very health conscious or and obviously
the IV restaurants the IV in Chelsea I
think it's the IV Chelsea garden is
stunning there's bumpkin in Chelsea
which I actually don't hear many
bloggers talking about but it's
absolutely gorgeous really nice kind of
hearty food so many places around
obviously guys just leave me a comment

London cuz I'm happy to provide and I
also have my Instagram guide to London

looking for those very photogenic
hotspots but um yeah it's been a
fabulous day from our facial to our
shopping mom absolutely loves her
handbag to blow dries and then afternoon
