vlog confession time I'm actually
filming this at the end of the weekly
vlog because upon editing I realized
that I had deleted the intro clip only
like 30 seconds worth of footage but
yeah it was basically me explaining my
outfit of the day so I didn't want to
just jump in with me explaining what
perfect I was wearing for the day so I
thought I would introduce this video
properly so it's a weekly vlog I have
got the dates a little bit messed up
because I've been poorly so I've not
been sticking to our usual schedule but
after this one it's all going back to
normal so I think it kicks off on a
Wednesday you've got some personal
shopping come shopping with me clips
there's also loads of moments just
Charlie and I and the dogs at home being
totally mad so it's a nice little
glimpse into our real family life and
lots and lots of Netflix within this
vlog so without further adieu let's cut
back to Wednesday and I think it starts
with me explaining what perfume I'm
wearing for the day why I this is the
perfume I have been wearing lately it is
German and London jasmine sambac and
marigold Cologne intense I would say
it's good for boys and girls but I just
absolutely love it it's quite like musky
I don't know it's like a cross between
feminine and also sexy man kind of smell
big big fan of that and also something
else I'm a big fan of these wire sell
lipsticks are like the bomb lipsticks
they give you a lovely color but not
quite that intense it's more pinky love
the packaging and also super comfortable
to wear so those are a couple of Beauty
favorites at the moment that's coming in
my handbag
let's go Kay so I've done at my meetings
for the day and I'm now in the personal
shopping suite at Topshop so the
personal shopping is free to book and
you can give them like a little brief as
to what you want so I let the girls know
that I'm going to Mexico next week and
they pulled me out this amazing
selection of pieces I've also grabbed a
couple of bits as well because I
couldn't resist looking around before
coming in I've got this gorgeous little
room all to myself so I thought I do
have a Tryon shop with you guys and
hopefully we can find some lovely pieces
so let's
just show you the room because it looks
so cute we've picked out lots of nice
colorful pieces I'm loving it this
outfit I feel like these are very
on-trend of a moment put a little paper
bag style shorts lacy tops denim shorts
some bright colors loads of swimwear
looking forward to trying on the Kazi is
and then they've got some really nice
almost kini ask bikinis some lovely
spring colors and then over here I
thought these were rather fabulous so
let's get trying okay I feel like this
first outfit is totally Mexico Instagram
goals so we've got this off the shoulder
top and this kind of ruched detail that
break very very stretchy this bag how
adorable is this not sure how well it
would do being packed in a suit place
sunglasses I've got this annoying little
security tag on them which makes them
quite hard to visualize but I think
they'll be amazing Instagram and then
we've got this skirt which I rather love
the color is amazing and it's also not
color that I would have chosen so very
glad that the personal shoppers picked
it up for me oh yeah this is outfit
number one okay so next we have an
outfit that is very me we've got this
lovely lace effect top with this fluted
sleeves which I'm a big big fan of
apologies about the lack of spray tan on
my legs I have a very pair at the moment
and then these shorts which have got
like a paper bag style waist I really
really like love this button detail the
top is just beautifully finished as you
can see on the sleeves
it is very sheer so I need to find a
nice bra to wear underneath it I've also
just had a very nice delivery pad some
Prosecco delivered which I will be
demolishing I think it might pair this
outfit with the sunglasses they are so
seriously cute so I always like to get a
bit of a wild card
whenever I try some things on because I
sometimes surprise myself with what I
like and these trousers were the wild
card they are pink kind of candy striped
trousers I got them in a 2530 which is
my usual Topshop size
and I think I'm in love with them I'm
not sure about how they go with this top
but it's definitely not a bad
combination I've paired it with my meals
but I could also try with these sandals
that she's brought up but yeah what do
you think to the trousers I feel like I
could potentially pull them off maybe
spring in London with some nice
open-toed sandals I will leave
everything that I'm trying on linked in
the description box so if you want to
shop any of them just click show more
but yeah I think these are actually
gonna be something that I add to my
shopping bag so I've got a couple of
more winning pieces here this blouse is
exactly what I needed for the trip to
Mexico I always like to have something
it's really lightweight so I can just
put on to cover my shoulders from the
midday Sun and if I'm eating or reading
or anything just don't wanna have my
shoulders out also good if you're going
anywhere religious because you have to
cover up so this kind of thing for
holidays is amazing and then the lovely
girls have just bought me these sandals
which are super light because the wooden
heel is actually hollow so they're
really really comfortable and I think
they'll be very practical for wearing on
holidays so two more winning pieces all
right here the next two pieces I'm not
sure I'd wear these two together but I
love them both separately so this skirt
is almost like a linen material I might
try the bigger size because I feel like
it's very clingy love the button detail
and then this top I really like I feel
like this could be the kind of top
defined in Club Monaco and oh my gosh
it's just absolutely gorgeous I think
this will be a perfect holiday top yeah
I really really like this imagine this
with jeans as well midi skirts yes big
fan of these two just not together okay
I am a big fan of these trousers very
very high waisted again they've got this
kind of paper bag style waist love the
big deep pockets love the length is I
think these will be really nice
travelling trousers really even a really
lovely comfortable material I think
these are the kind of thing that'll
probably stay in my holiday wardrobe not
too sure if I'd wear them around the UK
but for lots of upcoming trips not just
in Mexico I think needs to be really
really nice
so I feel like this top is literally the
perfect Tulum piece this color is very
like natural boho vibes which I really
really like
I think the shorts are a winner as well
they're the perfect length they're not
going up your bun which is definitely a
bonus but the story flattering love this
kind of rip detail definitely wearing
the wrong bra but with
like oh my gosh I'm so excited try it
tonight I say try I've already
financially I can entire to try you know
I have so you love it good evening the
back home again that now and I'm going
to be doing a bit of a evening skincare
routine / first impressions with you
I've got a couple of new products that
I'd like to try out and share with you
some thoughts on and and also going to
have a bit of a ramble about Instagram
because they have just changed their API
which is basically a tech term for their
I think it means a product into I don't
know what it means but basically a lot
of softwares and programs and websites
that rely on Instagram for data no
longer work so that means for example
that like - no it no longer works and
that is the way that lots of you were
able to shop my Instagram so what that
did was when that you were signed up to
like to know it and you liked one of my
photos you would get an email to your
inbox which had all of the product
information in it
now the inspiration to that API that no
longer works first thing I'm going to
try out is this new my solar milk from
Dior is from their life range which is
I'd say more of like a kind of
millennial range from deal a little bit
more affordable and also a lot more
natural which i think is amazing for a
brand as luxurious Dior I think a lot of
their products are like in ninety
percent natural if not more I'm
intrigued by this I love my slaughters
but I don't like closing milks so I'm
intrigued to see how a micelle and milk
will work this reminds me of a really
old-school Lancome Klein so that I used
to use so it's quite goopy on the cotton
pad I think I've probably got too much
they're actually spread that in half so
yeah I just basically did a tweet saying
that we shouldn't rely too much on
Instagram it's a platform that we don't
have and obviously works and we don't
have full control over Instagram
so a lot of bloggers are more
Instagrammers like that's their main
thing that's where they get the majority
of their work and I've always thought
it's very dangerous to do that because
you're relying on a platform that you
don't own and this is an example that
they can do whatever they want they can
just switch switch things off change
things they could for example will make
adverts illegal and then you would have
not earn any money on Instagram
obviously searchingly likely to know it
off is quite a big deal because it means
that we can't earn commission on the
products that we sell so the solution
for that is actually the like to know
it's app and if you follow me on
Instagram
Josey LDN which you should then if you
still want to continue shopping at my
Instagram you just need to download that
like to know it's app which I'll leave a
link to down below and then all you have
to do is find me on the app so fine
Josey LTM I'll leave the exact link to
where my pages and then click follow and
all of the outfits I post on Instagram
will automatically go to that app I
never be able to shot them from there so
it's obviously ways around it but it is
quite quite a big deal so there's my
Silla milk I have to say I'm really
really liking it it feels very gentle on
skin it's removing makeup it's probably
and it feels less liquidy obviously than
a nice little water so I think I'm going
to have to use a few more cotton pads
it's quite nice to have something a
little bit different to the usual my
little otter it's definitely very
effective at taking my makeup off all
these cotton pads are looking very beige
from my foundation ok so next I'm going
to use a bomb cleanser I always like to
do this as my second cleanse I feel like
it's bit more pampering especially in
the evenings I don't do this in the
mornings I'm gonna use the Eve LOM
cleanser this is one of the like
original bone cleansers this one is
really thick it smells amazing very
canna Miley it smells really natural
really lovely mix of ingredients so I
like to leave this on my skin that for a
little while I feel like my skin just
drinks in all the
lovely ingredients within this so I go
on quite heavily apply lots of product
and then while this is on my skin I just
kind of have a tidy up off the bathroom
because I've got my slaughters and
cotton pads and everything all over the
place so this will be on my skin for
about ten minutes and I always find that
this again is very calming the kernel is
really calming and soothing if I've had
a long day in the city then it's nice to
just feel like my skin is really
cleansed and just refreshed after a day
of pollution and gross mess from the
London Underground okay I'm looking very
scary and pale now but my final step is
applying some toner this is the Liz
Earle skin instant boost skin tonic and
I feel like toner is a really good last
step because removes any remaining
products not that there should be very
much and also just helps to balance out
the skin I feel like it's a really good
round off to the skin care routine any
remaining eye makeup you can see there's
a little bit of colour on there and then
the last thing that I'm going to apply
is of course new madeleine truel
origins glow commence a hydrating
coconut mask so Madeleine was saying
that this has come from her
long-standing love of coconuts is quite
a thick paste it's almost like
toothpaste consistency so muddy used to
live in Australia and she had a job
behind a bar where she were to chop the
coconuts and she would use the coconuts
in her diet obviously eating them and
putting them in her hair putting them on
her skin so naturally when origin was
asked about products ideas she said I
had to contain in coconuts this smells
absolutely incredible it's kind of
coconutty and lime at the same time very
fresh not like the kind of thick coconut
smell that you get from like Hawaiian
Tropic that kind of thing and it's going
on a lot thicker with an the what's that
green origins mask called the crunch
that's nice earthquake yeah
overnight as a court I know but it's a
lot thicker than the previous origins
hydrating mask which I guess is good for
more of a face mask whereas the other
one I would tend to leave on as a night
mask it's gonna really annoy me when
it's cold it's like thirst quenching
okay so this bad boy yes
sorry brings up drink up and yeah so
this is a lot thicker
oh yeah we're both having a mask night
have you got the shower at home yeah
aren't you we are big fans of origin
local marks Charlie's favorite mask has
always been the clear preference of that
yeah I use it twice a week yeah and he's
got all his rugby powers well I like
about it is your skin is quite red
afterwards which you shouldn't be
alarmed because actually that's actually
the mask bringing the blood to the
surface which helps skin renewal and I
think also is an indication I guess you
could multi masks if you have a
congested that's pretty what I should
have done congested t-zone but you want
a bit of hydration on the cheeks and you
can always see bring it down to the chin
as well okay so I'm gonna leave this on
for the next 20 minutes get in my
pajamas relax and watch some Netflix I
will catch up with you guys in the
morning good morning and happy Friday I
have the world's happiest slitty eyes oh
my goodness I'm with my coolest friend
in the uncoolest place
is Peggy portion and we are shooting
something very fun and exciting that
you'll see very very soon
George's Instagram is the most cool bike
acha describe it like the monochromatic
chic
basically everything
we're just having our 11 a.m. cake
Georgia has already
meant to be a lemon and roses I took I
sampled a little bit it was very good so
yeah we'll show you all the places of
shooting today
now we're gonna enjoy the sparkly lights
our hearts beating faster and I'm still
dancing with you yeah it's a bit of an
epic fail I'm showing you behind the
scenes of our photo shoot because as you
can tell I'm now home but photo days and
filming days are always a little bit
manic and vlogging is kind of the last
thing on my mind but we shot in four
different places on Elizabeth Street
which is the street the PEGI portion is
on and it happens to be filled with
shops that have floral shop fronts so
it's perfect for filming summer spring
content and now I'm home and I have to
deal with the post shoot mess which is
basically clothes everywhere Georgia
also very kindly nipped doddle and
grabbed my parcels I have a lot of
unboxing to do I don't know if I will do
it on the vlog folks I feel like a lot
of my recent vlogs have contained
bloggers men and boxing's but let me
know if you like seeing raagam and
unboxings in my vlogs I have however had
a very exciting delivery from Netflix
which is so cool it is for Dexter and
Dickens because they are my favorite
people to watch Netflix with so I'm
going to show you what's in that and
maybe do a bit of a hyperlapse of the
general unboxing and tiding because
there's a lot also got these which are
rather called from a company called
grace flower box I'm obsessed with these
everlasting flowers it's so nice to have
a florals all throughout the house so
I'm at the background noise by the way
charlie is on the phone to his sister
and he is such a loud talker and so yeah
gonna do some vlogger melon boxing and
then I'm gonna show you how I prepare
for big shoot days because you have a
big shoot day on Tuesday at heads or
house so alum I'll let you know how we
plan for days like that but first let's
have a tidy up moment ok I'm sorry the
lighting is not ideal in here but I want
to show you these goodies that we got
from Netflix because it is so cute so it
comes with a little note saying what has
four legs a tail and is the best of
English with Netflix your pet and others
so true man's best friend and a new
honorary title is the ultimate binge
port nur inside you'll find all the
essentials you need or need for Netflix
night in just don't forget the popcorn
is so
cute this is absolutely hilarious so
we've got a little squeaky toy which is
a TV remote which Dexter and Dickens are
going to go absolutely mad for those
absolutely brilliant and then this
reminds me of something else of stranger
things it's kind of like a giant waffle
that says Netflix on it again
my boys will love to shred this and then
if this is the best we have Netflix and
Dickens little bit / slash cowboy would
you call them like I don't know
neckerchief and then also Netflix and
Dexter my boys are gonna look so
handsome in this and then we also have a
towel and it says what's not a towel
it's a dog blanket it says oh my god it
says the snuggle is real I love that
that it's gonna be absolute perfect for
us to cuddling up in bed with my two
little cherubs so that's a very cool
delivery from Netflix and I already
showed you the flowers I also have the
new GHD strainers which is very very
generous of them these are the GHD gold
professional stylers that come with the
heat-resistant bag they are like the
Platinum stylers so amazing for curling
the hair and they've got the tri-zone
technology which just means your hair
doesn't get damaged great for curling
great for straightening and grateful the
long lasting condition of your hair as
well so that is amazing and so so
beautiful I think I'm gonna unbox
everything else and not talk through it
because we'll be here forever and I
really want to take the dogs for a walk
so let's get cracking while I open the
rest of my blogger mail I have my Peggy
portion cupcake from earlier because it
was too early to eat cakes oh yes I have
my red velvet cupcake that I'm gonna
demolish while I undo the rest of my
bloggers mouth
I want your more than blunt name I wanna
float on downstream
go and find my while James yeah I'd kill
to fill it or shake you like a twisted
man
I'll be burned by
ups and downs no in-betweens fire and
ice burn gasoline you know I love it
you know I love it love and hate
romantics in fire and ice gone with the
wind
you know I love it
yeah
well making
finished unboxing the blogger mail and
Chaz and I are now taking our sweet
cherubs for a little walk and then we're
gonna grab some dinner rose beautiful
evening and then I think it's going with
rain all of next week so making the most
of all the glorious sunshine you are
I've got a fun idea for a game shop yeah

quick come on sweets cherubs small boys
I'm mostly cool entry I like all new
Nikon and tricky chicken sweetest boy
yeah Dexter just got back from a dog
walk and we're about to start cooking
our Friday evening dinner we would
usually go out for an honest burger on
Fridays but as we had lunch out we're
gonna cook some fajitas but well Charlie
is cooking fun fact is actually Charlie
that doesn't roast the cooking in this
house well Chaz is cooking I'm gonna be
on my laptop and we are booking flights
for a very exciting holiday that we're
going on holiday slash work trip at the
end of this month so exciting times and
then Charlie is going out for some
drinks with some of his pals which means
that Dec see deke and I are gonna have a
nice chilled evening I'm going to take
off my gel nail varnish because it is
really outgrown its got like half a
centimeter of out groomed nurse I get
them done at London grace which is
there's one in Clapham
and there's also one in Marble Arch now
this one at Leicester Square I get a lot
of questions about my nannies that's
where I get them done
they never chip so they just grow out
but I want to get them done this is
really interesting for you I know I'm
even get them done just before we go to
Mexico so I just want to have normal
nail varnish on the next couple of days
so they can recover so I'm going to do
that while watching it some Netflix
whenever Charlie is not here i watch
suits because I only got into suits
about a month or so ago yes I was one of
the many that started watching it when
Mac and Michael became everywhere but
Charlie's already seen the entire I'm
not liking all of it I've seen I think
I've seen lots of the last two series it
does get a bit rubbish no the first
three series are awesome but like any TV
series you can't keep that up well
basically I have a lot of character
Harvey Specter oh my god he's severely
yes I reckon Louis Litts actually oh my
god I have a major crush on Harvey
Specter but anyway so we're never
charlie's away I catch up on suits
hopefully I one day get up to the point
where we can watch it together and also
because I fall asleep really really
early in the evenings I always miss the
end of films and things that I and I
watch so I need to re-watch the end of
it's a good now you see me yeah - now
you see me - yeah so I need to watch the
end of that because I first meet when
we're watching that Netflix the other
day so yeah I think Netflix did a study
where I was like our favorite person or
thing person person to watch a Netflix
with is not actually our other halves
but our dogs and all pets I think more
specifically which I would
wholeheartedly agree with they are the
best company although they don't bring
me food like Charlie does but Jack
scenes Nikki and I are gonna have a very
chill - Alan
so we're gonna get cooking or Charlie's
I'm gonna get flight booking
this is a little bit like all the time
he wouldn't be like this if he knew I
was right now it's not yeah I can pay
with PayPal
all right charlie has left the building
it's just me and the hounds what are you
crunching these boys are so naughty and
I've got my popcorn so it's time to
Netflix and woof that's right
not Netflix and chill I'm gonna set
myself up on the sofa I have got my
popcorn which smells so good it's making
my mouth water now it flicks on in the
background haven't fully decided what
I'm gonna watch yet maybe I'll try and
find a new film we shall see Dexter has
already made himself quite comfortable
on oh hello I know my chickie on our new
Netflix blanket and these are for you my
cherubs these are for you you have puppy
toys I'd rather lick your ear mummy okay
I'm literally going mad because I just
took the tag off the squeaky foam
remote-controlled I was gonna give dick
he's otherwise they'll argue and now I
can't find it this is taking and losing
the TV remote to a whole nother level
one story for you once we lost our TV
remote and couldn't find it for months
and months and months and then when we
got our Christmas decorations down the
next year we'd put it in the box with
the Christmas decorations have been
tidying away so that's where I've been
hidden all year long but luckily I have
my remote it's suggesting that I watch
Riverdale but I think I'm gonna watch
the crown or Gossip Girl no I think I'm
gonna have a good Dickie behind me such
a king Sexy's having a good chew on his
new toy what do you think young man
they'll settle down in a minute and I'll
have two boys snoring on top of me well
it's doing something Dexter just trod on
my remote no okay so I have got my so
come off nail things this will get rid
of the gel on my nails at the moment and
then when I have taken my gel off I'm
gonna use the Sally Hansen gel a rehab
strengthener this will hopefully bring
my nails back to good condition and all
the while just gonna sit back relax and
then
enjoy the company of my sweet baby boys
and you're exposed because of what we
did in seconds
later now and I'm gonna continue
watching this in the bed
luckily it'll just continue where I left
off because this will sleep to my
Netflix account and I'm gonna take my
makeup off and just probably fall asleep
watching your TV the little boys however
are gonna stay down here
not allowed in the bed as much as I
would love them to be so I'm gonna head
upstairs and I'll see you guys in the
morning
we just got back from a gym session and
the brunch at Gail's
and as you might be able to hear we've
now got a lexer doing the Lion King
soundtrack and we're gonna get us some
gardening
but first you've got to pick up all the
dog poo
it is Sunday afternoon now and this vlog
has now come a full circle this is where
I sat to film the intro clip that you
guys will have seen probably 25 minutes
ago at the beginning of this vlog but we
have had a lovely afternoon with my
brother and his family went for a Sunday
roast a nice Carberry so feeling very
full and satisfied it's only half 5:00 I
think Charlie and I are gonna just kind
of bunker down for the evening the
weather has taken a bit of a turn for
the worst and I've been editing this
vlog and it's already rather long so I'm
gonna round things off and say thank you
for watching I hope you guys have had a
fabulous week and/or weekend and I'll
see you very soon in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
